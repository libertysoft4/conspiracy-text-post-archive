And maybe Trump voters will even wake up and realize they&#39;ve been conned at some point. I know when Obama won a ton of people just went to sleep cause he was eloquent and said nice things and just ignored his policies to the point where people still argue with me when I say he was terrible and press freedom and whistleblowers when its easy to find that he was bad on those issues. I think in general Trumps policies are worse than clintons would have been but people definitely aren&#39;t asleep. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, Trump is proof the US will vote for any anti-establishment candidate, no matter what.</p>

<p>Every candidate that runs on &quot;change&quot; is going to be the favored candidate.  The people want to see change, but it just never happens, so they just move the next person promising change.</p>

<p>Obama ran on change, the middle class saw no change, so they moved onto the next candidate that would promise change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on the public wanting change and voting for the candidate that plays that card. And yes, we get bamboozled every time. But it does kinda seem like he&#39;s gotten some shit done. Tax cuts, lots of deregulations, pushing his immigration reform and seemingly playing ball with the dems to do just that, all the while getting beat up in the media and having a special investigation going on. I dunno, maybe I just want someone to actually do something that I&#39;m fooling myself. In any case, personally for me, if he renegotiates NAFTA and gets our jobs back from Mexico, then that&#39;s real change and he&#39;ll absolutely have my vote in 2020.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tax cuts?  really?  they are not going to help the average American, and those that do get help, will only be for a few years as it is temporary, unlike the corporate which were permanent.</p>

<p>Lots of deregulation....well please tell me which benefit the American people more than the Corporate overlords?</p>

<p>Immigration reform...seriously he wants to spend on a freaking wall.  There is a far greater danger from our own citizens that immigrants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vast majority of average Americans will be helped by the tax cut. I don&#39;t have children so I wont get the additional child tax credit, but my sister does. My brother does. The bulk of my friends do. But I do get to get out from paying the fine I&#39;ve gotten for the past few years for not paying for insurance that I WOULD NOT have used. So that is a win for me. </p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t agree more with you on how our tax cut is only temporary and corporations are permanent. I don&#39;t like it either. I do wonder why democrats wouldn&#39;t try to change that though. They could have worked with the republicans to get that changed you know, but they didn&#39;t. Which makes me think that they were actually complicit. </p>

<p>The deregulation&#39;s have saved closed to $600 million dollars so far. And yes it is a benefit for businesses and corporations. But my question for you is, who makes up businesses and corporations? American workers. If the company you work for is able to prosper and grow then they&#39;ll be able to hire more folks and hopefully pay them better. I realize that this is not always the case. I&#39;m not necessarily a fan of trickle down economics. I do see that the CEO&#39;s get the bigger share than the working man does. But if you take the ability away for business to prosper then there&#39;s no chance for the middle class Americans because those jobs simply won&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>And yes he wants to build a wall. So did Hillary. So did Bernie. So did a lot of other democrats. I too feel like this is a country of immigrants and that that&#39;s not a bad thing. I&#39;m not a native american, therefore at some point my ancestors came here from another country. And truthfully I was on the same side you were on when I first heard him talking about this during the campaign. My experience with first generation Mexicans in the restaurant business is that they were some hard working, good people, just wanting to provide for their families. However looking into this I came to the realization that immigration reform is NOT a bad thing at all. Why would we let people who come here illegally bypass all of the other folks who are trying to come here legally? Why do we allow a lottery to decide who gets to come into our country? Why wouldn&#39;t we reform those things? Why is this such a partisan political topic? Why are illegal aliens allowed to vote? </p>

<p>In any case my point above was to point out that he did legitimately  get stuff done his first year. And again, NAFTA is the thing I&#39;m the most concerned with. The small town I live in has absolutely been affected by it. Whirlpool used to be here, which employed thousands of my fellow citizens, is now in Mexico. Which has a direct effect on the whole town. I&#39;m just a waitress, but being in the service industry you rely on people having the money to be able to go eat. And a lot of folks down here simply don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you familiar with Bannon’s career history? </p>

<p>Every tweet the president makes, every publicity stunt he participates in is carefully planned and executed to achieve maximum effectiveness. They know the psychology of the masses and they exploit it. </p>

<p>I see Bannon’s exit, followed by the outlandish book, which was then followed by Bannon’s rebuke AND the authors rebuke as planned. </p>

<p>This entire concept is yet another propaganda charade to distract the mainstream conversation from the issues they are really pushing that they don’t want us talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the rest of the email.  The democrats wanted to push these &quot;extreme&quot; guys to the top so that the established candidates would have to go further right and it would hurt them in the general.</p>

<p>Also, consider that the Dems and the Reps are both corrupt.  The Dems fucked over Bernie, just like the Reps fucked over Ron Paul.  Knowing this, the Dems would have never thought that Trump or any other outsider had an actual chance at being nominated.  And the Reps did try to fuck Trump over.  They were trying for a brokered convention.  It&#39;s the reason they kept Cruz and Kasich in the race even after Trump already had enough delegates to win outright.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes your first paragraph isn&#39;t really mutually exclusive with the &quot;desirable conditions&quot; I describe in my post which are quoted from the email.  Push the mainstream candidates to the right, but also, we want the pied piper candidates to be front runners.  We want these unpalatable candidates to be the people we meet in the general.  That was the idea.  There&#39;s nothing about this &quot;sitting out&quot; you described originally, and your claim that Clinton didn&#39;t want Trump, is an outright fantasy, as the email demonstrates.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what you said, and it is not true.  They chose multiple extreme candidates including, but not limited to, Trump Carson and Cruz, and they did it because they thought it would hurt the establishment candidates, not because they wanted to run against Donald Trump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s nothing about this &quot;sitting out&quot; you described originally</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I already explained it.  Using &quot;Pied Piper&quot; to refer to these candidates implies some connection between the Pied Piper story and these candidates, right?  Otherwise why use the term?  So if the Pied Piper in the story gathered up a following and led them off into the wilderness, never to be seen again, then it would make sense that a Pied Piper candidate would be used to refer to a candidate that would do the same.  This is exactly what happened with Cruz and #nevertrump.  A lot of Cruz supporting #nevertrumpers sat out the general or voted third party.</p>

<p>He isn&#39;t going to get us out of Middle East entanglements. In fact, I believe he&#39;s going to take us to war with Iran because they&#39;ve been the next domino for a while. </p>

<p>He isn&#39;t going to stop drone striking around the world. Didn&#39;t he actually give the CIA more influence on droning? </p>

<p>He isn&#39;t going to roll back police militarization or police powers. He supports Civil Asset Forfeiture, which is nothing more than government theft from citizens. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a run of the mill big government, law and order candidate who is passing republican legislature because it&#39;s good for his base and donors.

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is a symptom of the systemic rot, not the cause. I agree with you- he is galvanizing many, but the problem is that too many on the Left and Center are being pushed back into the Corporatist DNC fold. They honestly think HRC would have been better, and they argue with people like you and I who try to point out that HRC, like Trump, like Obama, like every President for at least the last 40 years, would continue looting the country and steering the Republic towards its doom.</p>

<p>We need to break out of the Corporatist fold, and the only way to do that is to shatter the current Corporate Centrist hold on power in the DNC. This means grassroots activism, to storm the Party from the ground up. It&#39;s the only way we will get a fair Primary come 2020, and the only way Bernie or someone like him can crush Kamala, Deval, Oprah, or any other Corporate whore they inevitably try to run instead of an <em>actual</em> Progressive populist. </p>

<p>We take the Party with grassroots organizing. The smallest organizational unit of the Democratic Party is the Precinct. Any registered Dem can show up to their local Party meetings and vote for their Precinct Chair. Precinct Chairs vote for County Chairs, who vote for State Chairs, who vote for National Chairs. This is how we take the Party. 8 State Parties have already been taken from the Corporatists- Nebraska, Wyoming, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Kentucky, Missouri, Cali is captured except for the Chairmanship, which the Corporatists literally had to stuff ballots to avoid Kimberly Ellis from defeating their shill Bauman. Massachusetts is also taken in all but the Chairmanship. </p>

<p>Step by step a coalition of citizen activists, consisting of Our Revolution, a grassroots organizing effort founded in the wake of Bernie&#39;s campaign, and regional organizations like the WFP and DSA and more, are taking the fight to the Party. This is the only hope for a political solution. </p>

The main issue this time was Clinton had a ton of name recognition and support and the media first ignored Bernie and then constantly attacked him.

<p>Not true though.  The economy works around government - not because of it.  It doesn&#39;t wait for government reports - government reports documents the decisions of business.

    <div class="md"><p>Stock Market is not the best barometer for the economy, because it tends to ignore Main Street over Wall Street. That said, the growth is temporary. If you look at the underlying fundamentals, the economy is not on solid footing, and hasn&#39;t been since &#39;08. </p>

<p>For example- 41% of jobs lost in 08 were High Wage jobs, but only 30% of jobs created since then are High Wage. 37% of jobs lost in the Recession were Middle-Wage jobs, but only 26% of jobs created since then are Middle Wage. And 21% of all jobs lost in &#39;08 were low wage, service sector jobs...yet a staggering 44% of all jobs created since &#39;08 are low wage, service sector. This means millions of Americans are literally locked out of the Middle Class.</p>

<p>US Credit Card debt has reached record highs as of Q4 2017, at $1.023 Trillion. This is higher than in &#39;08. Student Loan debt is at 1.2 Trillion, and rising. Auto Debt is up to $1.2 Trillion, and delinquencies jumped in Q3 and Q4 from 6.5% to 7.2%. Mortgage debt is up, and the average new home price in the US is higher than in &#39;08, at $250,000. The economy isn&#39;t doing good. The US Middle Class is drowning in debt, and when &#39;08 part two hits, sooner rather than later, it is going to be a shit show of epic proportions. QE 1-3 only postponed the pain, so enjoy these times now, because the reckoning is coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can agree to disagree. But the links, and the numbers I gave you, are far more than a bunch of inconsequential numbers. The US economy is fundamentally unsound and careening towards a cliff the likes of which has not been seen since the 30&#39;s. We have fundamentally altered our economy with the &quot;recovery&quot; from 08. And this isn&#39;t just Democrat policies lol. This is the fault, and the end result, of policies from every administration since at least Carter. Republicans and Democrats. All of them. </p>

<p>Time will bear out the Truth. This is the longest &quot;recovery&quot; in the Post-War era, we are due for a recession sooner rather than later, and Trump will bear the brunt of it, even though he hasn&#39;t even done anything to the situation at this point. He will be the captain of the ship when it hits the iceberg, and as I said neither he nor any of the Presidents for the last 40 years has done a goddamn thing to turn that ship around. </p>

<p>You can patronize me all you want. The sky never stopped falling from &#39;08, it was only slowed, and again, if you actually looked at the numbers I presented with a critical eye you would see just how weak the US Middle Class is. It will not survive the shock of the next Great Recession, and QE won&#39;t be there to band-aid the gaping wound again. We postponed the depression that should have occurred in &#39;08.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Such a simplistic answer. It <em>was</em> a recovery. Just an incredibly weak one that, as I showed you with the job creation statistics, fundamentally altered our economy. Millions of people who had Middle Class jobs in &#39;08 literally <em>can&#39;t</em> anymore, because they just don&#39;t exist. They were replaced with low wage Service Sector jobs. The economy has been fundamentally altered. Further, the pace of recoveries has been slowing in every one since 1980. Each recession has been slightly worse than the last. Growth, overall, is slowing down, even if there are strong quarters here and there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s changing fast - for the better. You know what will fix that whole debt mess faster than anything? More jobs and bigger paychecks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More service sector jobs with low wages. More families struggling to get by and going deeper in debt to do so. Don&#39;t you see why the US consumer debt is such a massive tell? People aren&#39;t seeing their incomes rise. Wages are growing at an average of 2% a year, while inflation grows at 2.5%, which means y/o you actually lose .5% of your purchasing power. This also doesn&#39;t account for the yearly inflation of separate goods- like Milk, Beef, and other staples. I love this country, I care for this Republic, but we are careening towards a cliff that will suck an entire generation down with it. </p>

<p>As I said, time will bear out the Truth. You need wait no more than a couple of years for the next recession. </p>

<p>Lol. It&#39;s not just me calling it a &quot;recovery&quot;, it&#39;s the actual definition of the word. It is considered a recovery by Economists. But see, here you and I almost agree.

<p>You are giving far too much weight to immigration as the problem in the US economy. Again- it is far, <em>far</em> deeper than that, but you want to ignore those realities in favor of Trumps talking points and nice, easy to digest sound bytes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you point to the Obama era and say &quot;those jobs don&#39;t exist.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course they don&#39;t in an economy flooded with foreign workers and hostile to investment in manufacturing and infrastructure.</p>

<p>You are right on one things though.  This isn&#39;t just about foreign workers.  It&#39;s also about high taxes on the kind of businesses that create middle class jobs.  Policies that drive up the prices of energy for businesses that create middle class jobs.   Trade policies that made America hostile to the kind of businesses that create middle class jobs.  It&#39;s about policies and disincentives that made the US a bad place to invest or build businesses in America that provide middle class jobs.  It&#39;s about a &quot;government first and control from Washington DC&quot; mentality that stifled entrepreneurial endeavors.</p>

<p>Those numbers you put your stock in are history.  The lesson is that it isn&#39;t about watching that stats, it&#39;s about identifying where the fulcrum points are that change the numbers and having the guts to apply pressure. </p>

<p>Again, the solution to debt is more jobs and bigger paychecks. That&#39;s a Trump win.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You aren&#39;t grasping the fact that these bigger paycheck jobs just don&#39;t exist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Service sector jobs&quot; is pretty undefendable on your part. The push is for manufacturing jobs, construction, and infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Umm...it&#39;s literally the numbers my friend. They are literally the majority of jobs created since 2008- like waitressing and other restaurant jobs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s not to say that people in service jobs won&#39;t prosper. Cutting the number of immigrants (legal and illegal) will create a labor pinch and since labor is like anything else, when there&#39;s a shortage the prices rise. Nothing increases salaries like a labor shortage and a robust market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cutting out immigrant labor isn&#39;t going to be as dramatic as you think. Also- 11 million people aren&#39;t going to be kicked out of the country, it just won&#39;t happen. And the fact that you think it will is a false hope bordering on delusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simple economics and why we haven&#39;t seen paychecks rise during the 8 years of slow motion &quot;recovery&quot; (if you insist on calling it that) is because we&#39;ve been bringing in tons of outside workers to depress wages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol. It&#39;s not just me calling it a &quot;recovery&quot;, it&#39;s the actual definition of the word. It is considered a recovery by Economists. But see, here you and I almost agree. The recovery was pathetic, and it fundamentally altered our economy, but it&#39;s not going to get better. This is the trend, and the culmination of 40+ years of monetary policy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was educated visa workers on one side and unskilled labor on the other side depressing the paychecks on the top and bottom earners.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are giving far too much weight to immigration as the problem in the US economy. Again- it is far, <em>far</em> deeper than that, but you want to ignore those realities in favor of Trumps talking points and nice, easy to digest sound bytes.</p>
