    <div class="md"><p>Selling military arms to Saudi Arabia whom funded and supported the terrorists on 9/11, bailing out the banks in interest rate schemes, recognizing Jerusalem as the capital, being bailed out of debt by Wilbur Ross from Rothschild Inc&#39;s bankruptcy advisor team and certainly much more I haven&#39;t learned about yet paint a very different picture.

<p>They are in many ways mutually exclusive actually because Russia is supporting Syria and Syria is fighting vs. Saudi Arabian backed terrorist groups. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Globalism is a group of ideologies that advocate the concept of globalization. It tends to advocate for such policies as increases in immigration, interventionism, and global governance. Economically, globalism varies between free trade and lowering tariffs to Marxist proletarian internationalism. It is typically viewed as opposite of nationalism, and has become increasingly divisive in politics in many developed countries, such as the United States.--was the wiki on globalism, now has been edited hundreds of times. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t take my word for it. They admit to it themselves. </p>

<p>&quot;We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it. The only question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or consent.&quot; <strong>—Statement by Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member James Warburg to The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17th, l950</strong></p>

<p>&quot;We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries.&quot; <strong>--David Rockefeller, founder of the Trilateral Commission, in an address to a meeting of The Trilateral Commission, in June, 1991</strong> </p>

<p>&quot;Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an &quot;extraterrestrial&quot; invasion or Russians!!], whether real or promulgated [emphasis mine], that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.&quot; <strong>—Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberger Conference, Evians, France, 1991</strong></p>

<p>&quot;In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn&#39;t such a great idea after all.&quot; <strong>--Strobe Talbot, President Clinton&#39;s Deputy Secretary of State, as quoted in Time, July 20th, l992</strong></p>

<p>&quot;For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that&#39;s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.&quot; <strong>—David Rockefeller&#39;s Memoirs (Random House, New York, 2002)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control.... Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent. <strong>—Congressman Larry P. McDonald, 1976, killed in the Korean Airlines 747 that was shot down by the Soviets</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical. What the Trilateral Commission intends is to create a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nationstates involved. As managers and creators of the system ,they will rule the future.&quot; <strong>—U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater in his l964 book: With No Apologies</strong></p>

<p>For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn&#39;t. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations-One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared &quot;ammunition&quot; in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support...... &quot;The UN is but a long-range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One-World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. &quot;The depression was the calculated &#39;shearing&#39; of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank. <strong>—Curtis Dall, FDR&#39;s son-in-law as quoted in his book, My Exploited Father-in-Law</strong></p>

<p>wall street is up, and the GDP is rising.</p>

<p>Some of us remember how IMPORTANT it was, during the Obama years, that the Dow Jones and GDP are metrics made for corporations and economists looking at aggregate measurements, not actually all that important for the vast numbers of working Americans. </p>

<p>Productivity and wages have been decoupled for decades now. </p>

<p>The Dow Jones measurement is of 30 companies, and has more to do with the potential dividends their stockholders will get than anything else. </p>

<p>Sure some people will cash out their 401k funds during this high point, but tons of people have no such savings and most people won&#39;t be cashing out now.</p>

<p><strong>Boasting about corporate measurements on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, where people <em>know</em> better, is inane. It works at cross-purposes with your attempt to boost Trump. It just reminds people how little he&#39;s ACTUALLY done besides sit back and watch certain numbers that steadily rose under Obama <em>continue</em> to rise.</strong></p>
