        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi guys/gals, I&#39;m working on an episode of a financial crime, history of unethical moments in finance podcast and I need some help.  The episode is basically a history of the Rothschild family and I just want to include as much cool &amp; terrifying information as possible.  Below is the script I have for the episode.  I&#39;ve learned that it&#39;s rather... difficult to tell an accurate story on this family.  They are definitely secretive, and what blows my mind is that even the well confirmed facts about the Rothschilds are enough to give you goosebumps.  Please let me know if you have anything that you think is noteworthy to add and thank you in advance.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Few names are as synonymous with banking as the Rothschild family.  Shrouded in mystery, how did the elusive family rise to power, and where are they today?  Welcome to the third episode of The Dark Side of Money.</p>

<p>In 1744 Mayer Amschel Rothschild was born in Frankfurt Germany, the son of a currency exchanger who supplied coins to the Prince of Hesse.  Mayer is widely considered the “founding father of international finance” and Forbes ranked him 7th in the “Twenty Most Influential Businessmen of All Time” list.  Growing up in poverty, Rothschild eventually secured an apprenticeship at the banking firm Simon Wolf Oppenheimer and learned useful knowledge in foreign trade and currency exchanging.  He eventually became a dealer in antiques and rare coins, eventually winning the patronage of Prince of Hesse, now Wilhelm IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, who earlier patronaged his father.  </p>

<p>Rothschild expanded banking services to the crown prince in 1769, becoming the court factor, or court banker; since only Jewish people could lend with interest, as the practice of usury was forbidden in Christianity.  He began financing wars, lending money to England to hire Hessian mercenaries which were used by England in the American Revolution.  During the 1770s he financed Adam Weishaupt, the man credited with starting the Order of the Illuminati.  In 1790 he uttered his famous phrase “Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who makes the laws”.  The next year, Alexander Hamilton, Rothschilds chief US supporter, created the First Bank of the United States, of which Rothschild and many other English investors had a stake in.</p>

<p>Around this time he began sending his sons to the financial centers of Europe.  The eldest, Amschel, was placed in charge of the Frankfurt bank.  The second son, Salomon, was sent to Vienna, where he soon took over the banking monopoly formerly shared among five Jewish families. The third son, Nathan, founded the London branch, and became one of the wealthiest men ever, and the richest among the Rothschilds. Karl, the fourth son, went to Naples, and worked extensively in finance with the Medici family. The youngest son, James, founded the French branch in Paris.</p>

<p>While I recommend you study all 5 of Mayer’s sons, as they all have remarkable stories, let’s focus on Nathan Mayer Rothschild, his third son who moved to London.  In 1798 at the age of 21 Nathan moved the Manchester and established a business in textile trading and finance, later moving to London and making a fortune trading in bills of exchange in 1805.  The next year he married Hannah Barent-Cohen, the daughter of a wealthy diamond dealer, and grand-aunt of Karl Marx.  In 1806 Napoleon invaded Hesse, causing Wilhelm to become exiled, but Mayer Rothschild was able to continue as his banker, investing funds in London through Nathan.  The family also profited from importing goods, circumventing Napoleon&#39;s continental blockade. In 1809 Nathan began to deal in gold bullion, making it a cornerstone of his business.  Around this time Nathan began lending money to pay for British troops fighting against Napoleon.  In 1811 he set up N. M. Rothschild and Sons in London, which still trades today, and perfected the art of lending to governments during wartime, and having the winner cover the loser’s debt.  Nathan almost single-handedly financed the British War effort, while Jacob would fund Napoleon, both sharing information through their system of agents, couriers, and spies.</p>

<p>Also in 1811 the First Bank of The United States charter expired, and was not renewed due to suspicion over its foreign influence.  James Madison, president at the time said <em>&quot;History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit and violent means possible, to maintain their control over governments, by controlling money and its issuance.&quot;</em>
Since the Rothschilds had a significant stake in the bank, and this was a profitable monopolistic venture, Nathan issued the threat “Either the application for the renewal of the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war”. British Prime Minister Spencer Perceval was against the war, but was unexpectedly assassinated and replaced by Robert Banks Jenkinson, who was for it.  Thus beginning the War of 1812, which Nathan of course financed, declaring “Teach these impudent Americans a lesson. Bring them back to colonial status.”  In the same year, Moses Taylor, an associate of the Rothschild family, formed the National City Bank of New York in 1812, which later became Citibank.  Financing the war caused a doubling of US debt, and in so desperate need of funds, formed a new central bank in 1816, which was once again dominated by foreign investors, including the Rothschilds.  Mayer Amschel Rothschild died in 1812, leaving one billion francs to his 5 sons.</p>

<p>There is a famous story related to Nathan, and that is his famous multi-million dollar trade after the battle of Waterloo in 1815.  Essentially, his spies informed him that the British defeated Napoleon before the British government knew.  Once he got word of it, he began selling his bonds on the exchange.  People suspected this meant Rothschild knew that the British lost, and began a massive sell-off of people scrambling to lock in gains.  Once prices reached their lowest, he began buying everything he could get his hands on, right around when news was received that the british actually won the battle of Waterloo.  This caused prices on the stock market to skyrocket, making Nathan a tidy multi-million pound profit off the trade.  Not bad, for a days work.  The French, needing massive amounts of loans to rebuild after the war, was financed by the Rothschilds.  They bought vast amounts of government bonds, causing the prices to increase.  In early November 1818 they dumped them on the open market, causing France to go into a financial panic.  The Rothschilds then stepped in and took control of the money supply.  </p>

<p>In 1822 the emperor of Austria made the five Rothschild brothers Barons, but Nathan chose not to take up the title.  This earned them the ability to add “de” or “Von” to their surname.</p>

<p>Nathan began issuing bonds to the british government, attaining such a position of power that in 1825 he was able to supply enough coins to avoid a liquidity crisis in the Bank of England.  In the same year he also brokered the independence of Brazil from Portugal, on the condition that Brazil should take over the 1.5 million pound loan made to the Portuguese government by N M Rothschild &amp; Sons.  He then founded the Alliance Assurance Company, which is now Royal &amp; SunAlliance.  In 1830 he helped finance the country of Belgium, which just gained independence and was looking for investors.  In 1835 he purchased the rights to Almaden mines in southern Spain, effectively gaining a world monopoly on mercury, a vital component of gold and silver refining.  Nathan also become known for his role in the abolition of the slave trade, by financing a 20 million pound buyout of the plantation industry’s slaves.  By the time of his death in 1836, his personal net worth was amounted to .62% of British national income. </p>

<p>A description of Nathan at the London Stock Exchange was quoted <em>“He leaned against the &#39;Rothschild Pillar&#39; ... hung his heavy hands into his pockets, and began to release silent, motionless, implacable cunning” “Eyes are usually called the windows of the soul. But in Rothschild&#39;s case you would conclude that the windows are false ones, or that there was no soul to look out of them. There comes not one pencil of light from the interior, neither is there one gleam of that which comes from without reflected in any direction. The whole puts you in mind of an empty skin, and you wonder why it stands upright without at least something in it. By and by another figure comes up to it. It then steps two paces aside, and the most inquisitive glance that you ever saw, and more inquisitive than you would ever have thought of, is drawn out of those fixed and leaden eyes, as if one were drawing a sword from a scabbard. The visiting figure, which has the appearance of coming by accident and not by design, stops just a second or two, in the course of which looks are exchanged which, though you cannot translate, you feel must be of most important meaning. After this, the eyes are sheathed up again, and the figure resumes its stony posture. During the morning, numbers of visitors come, all of whom meet with a similar reception and vanish in a similar manner. Last of all the figure itself vanishes, leaving you utterly at a loss.”</em></p>

<p>On Sep 10, 1833 Andrew Jackson announced the government would no longer use the Second Bank of the United States, declaring “You are a den of vipers and thieves. I have determined to rout you out, and by the Eternal, I will rout you out!”  An assassination attempt was made on Jackson, to which he later claimed he knew it was the Rothschilds.  When asked on his deathbed what was his greatest accomplishment, he said “I killed the bank”.  The United States would go 80 years without a central bank in what was called the wildcat banking era.</p>

<p>In 1840 the Rothschilds become the Bank of England’s bullion brokers.  They set up agencies in California, and shortly after the California gold rush began.  President John Tyler repeatedly vetoed the act to renew the charter for the Bank of the United States, and received hundreds of letters threatening him with assassination.</p>

<p>In 1845 James and Salomon Rothschild built the first major railway line from Paris to Austria.  In 1847 Nathan’s son Lionel was elected to the parliamentary seat for the City of London, the first Jewish person to do so.  In 1852 N M Rothschilds &amp; Sons began refining gold and silver for the Royal Mint and the Bank of England, and other international customers.</p>

<p>In response the American civil war, Otto Von Bismarck said “The division of the United States into federations of equal force was decided long before the Civil War by the high financial powers of Europe. These bankers were afraid that the United States, if they remained in one block and as one nation, would attain economic and financial independence, which would upset their financial domination over the world. The voice of the Rothschilds prevailed... Therefore they sent their emissaries into the field to exploit the question of slavery and to open an abyss between the two sections of the Union.”</p>

<p>In 1861 President Abraham Lincoln approached the Rothschilds to try to obtain loans to support the ongoing American civil war.  The Rothschilds were already financing the south through various agents.  They agreed on the condition that Lincoln will charter another US central bank, and would pay 24 to 36% interest on all monies loaned.  Lincoln, furious about the high level of interest, decided to print his own debt free money and informed the public this was legal tender for public and private debt, calling them “greenbacks”.  By that time next year $449 million greenbacks were printed.  Lincoln stated “We gave the people of this republic the greatest blessing they ever had, their own paper money to pay their own debts.”</p>

<p>The Rothschilds published the following story in the london times: <em>“If that mischievous financial policy, which had its origin in the North American Republic, should become indurated down to a fixture, then that government will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay off debts and be without a debt. It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce. It will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of civilized governments of the world. The brains and the wealth of all countries will go to North America. That government must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.”</em></p>

<p>In 1863 the Rothschilds helped finance John D. Rockefeller to form an oil business called Standard Oil.  In 1864 Lincoln discovers that the Tsar of Russia, Alexander II, was having problems with the Rothschilds because he was refusing their continual attempts to set up a central bank in Russia.  Lincoln asked the Tsar for help, who agreed and anchored his fleet in New York and California, making it clear that if any other country interfered, Russia would side with Lincoln.  In a statement to Congress Lincoln said “I have two great enemies, the Southern Army in front of me, and the financial institution in the rear. Of the two, the one in my rear is my greatest foe.”, later that year Lincoln was assassinated.</p>

<p>The family funded Cecil Rhodes in the creation of the nation of Rhodesia, and took control of the Rio Tinto mining company to extract resources from the country.  After Rhodes death the Rothschilds managed his estate and set up the Rhodes Scholarship at the University of Oxford. In 1875 the Rothschilds financed two great projects, the first channel tunnel connecting France to England, and assisting Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli in purchasing the Suez canal.  In 1886 they gain a substantial amount of Russian oil fields, forming the Caspian and Black Sea Petroleum Company, which quickly becomes the world’s second largest oil producer.  In 1887 the Rothschilds finance a series of Diamond mines in South Africa, becoming the biggest shareholders of the De Beers company.</p>

<p>In 1891 a British Labour Leader made the following statement on the Rothschilds <em>“This blood-sucking crew has been the cause of untold mischief and misery in Europe during the present century, and has piled up its prodigious wealth chiefly through fomenting wars between States which ought never to have quarrelled.  Whenever there is trouble in Europe, wherever rumours of war circulate and men’s minds are distraught with fear of change and calamity you may be sure that a Rothschild is at his games somewhere near the region of the disturbance.”</em>   The Rothschilds have financed several wars at this point.  Obviously this is bad PR, which is why they purchased Reuters news agency to have some control of the media.</p>

<p>In 1895 Edmond James de Rothschild visited Palestine and began financing the first Jewish colonies there.  In 1907 another Rothschild associate, Jacob Schiff, warned the New York Chamber of Commerce: “Unless we have a Central Bank with adequate control of credit resources, this country is going to undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its history.” Shortly after that speech the Panic of 1907 occured, in which the New York Stock Exchange lost half its value in 3 weeks.  The same year the Japanese government approached the Rothschilds to finance the Russo-Japanese war, and the family issued 11.5 million pounds worth of war bonds, about 1.03 billion pounds today.</p>

<p>On December 22nd 1913, a third central bank was established in the United States, the Federal Reserve.  “Federal” being an ironic term, as it is a private company with an estimated profit exceeding $150 billion per year and has never once published its accounts.  Needless to say the Rothschilds still have shares in the company to this day.  Woodrow Wilson, president during the creation of the Federal Reserve, later expressed regret over it saying <em>&quot;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world — no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.&quot;</em></p>

<p>By 1914 the Rothschilds gained control of the three European news agencies, Wolff in Germany, Reuters in England, and Havas in France.  In 1918 they financed the Bolsheviks and order them to execute Tsar Nicholas II.  In 1919 the Versailles peace treaty was hosted by Baron Edmund de Rothschild, who during the conference created the state of Israel.  A famous letter called the Balfour declaration was sent from the foreign secretary to Lord Rothschild, declaring the creation and recognition of Israel.  Also in 1919 N M Rothschild and Sons are given the role to determine the daily price of gold, daily at 11 am, in the same room until 2004.</p>

<p>During World War 2, Nazi Germany devastated the Austrian Rothschilds and seized all their assets, forcing the family to escape to the United States and lose their entire fortunes, include a number of palaces and a huge amount of artwork.  The banks assets became the property of Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>Around this time the influence and power of the Rothschilds began to decline.  American financial firms began to overtake them in terms of power, and new names and banking dynasties rose up.  Dilution of wealth is natural over time, especially over several generations.  Two hundred years of consistent wealth is extremely impressive, considering their humble origins.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of descendants of Amschel Mayer Rothschild alive today.  Mr Burns lookalike and current patriarch of the dynasty Jacob Rothschild doesn’t even make the billionaires list.  Only one Rothschild appears on Forbes list of billionaires, Benjamin de Rothschild.</p>

<p>Estimating the true wealth of the Rothschilds is very difficult.  Benjamin de Rothschild, richest of the living Rothschilds, is worth about $1.59 billion, not much compared to the $100 billion of Jeff Bezos.  How much money could the entire family be worth?  I have heard estimates that the entire family is worth $500 trillion dollars.  However, the entire wealth of the world is estimated to be $200 trillion, less than half of the previous amount.  The main remaining family business, the Rothschild group, is an investment bank with a revenue of approximately $500 million, in comparison Walmart has an annual revenue of nearly $500 billion.  If I had to give them a charitable estimate, I would say the entire family is worth around $1 to $2 trillion dollars today, still making them the richest family in the world.  The fact is that while the Rothschilds used to be some of the wealthiest people who ever lived, their current descendents are measly multi-millionaires and single digit billionaires.  Empires rise and fall, and the Rothschilds are no exception.  If they are known for anything today, it is their excellent wine estates.</p>

<p>The lessons we can draw from the Rothschilds is that war racketeering is a profitable business, control of the money supply is control of a nation, and that you too could rise up from poverty to form one of the richest families ever.</p>

<p>(End Quote : ”If my sons did not want wars, there would be none.&quot; -- Gutle Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild and mother of his five sons )</p>

<p>Again, thank you for any info you can provide.  While it is a new podcast I am very excited to talk about what I find an important topic, the truth about money.  I have ~64 episodes planned already, and this one in particular excites me.

    <div class="md"><p>You asked for interesting facts and a lot has already been covered here but there is an astonishing amount of things that have been named after them. </p>

<p>Everything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Rothschild,_2nd_Baron_Rothschild">insect, plant and animal species</a>, parks, wines, buildings to an island in Antartica. Frankly it is hard to find all of the things named after the Rothschild family because the list is so large. </p>

<p>Here is a quote from the wiki article I linked above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another 153 insects, 58 birds, 17 mammals, three fish, three spiders, two reptiles, one millipede and one worm also carry his name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you dig around you&#39;ll find more. It&#39;s weird how many things are named after them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes!  But it’s complicated.  From what I can tell the Rothschild family used to be much more powerful than it is today. (Still powerful though)</p>

<p>Back then they basically owned the Bank of England, acted as a lender of last resort, and a few served as president of the bank.  They also had a heavy stake in the first and second bank of the United States.</p>

<p>The Bank of England was nationalized in 1946, making private ownership obsolete.  Today they probably have some share in the federal reserve, but not a controlling share.  Other wealthy families probably own more.  I wouldn’t be surprised if they had a share in most (if not all) central banks, the IMF, and the BIS (the central bank of central banks).</p>

<p>It’s near impossible to get percentage ownership of these things though.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Firstly a small nitpick - there is no such thing as &quot;president&quot; of the BoE, they are called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_the_Bank_of_England">Governors</a>&quot;. Secondly, there has never been a Rothschild (or any other Jew for that matter) who has served as governor or head of the bank. Finally, whilst the Rothschilds have both borrowed from and lent to the Bank of England at various points, they have never to my knowledge owned shares in the bank itself. It&#39;s possible as, like you say, the bank was not nationalised until 1946, however any shares they might have owned prior to that would certainly not have been a controlling stake.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t already, I highly recommend reading The House of Rothschild by Niall Ferguson. It&#39;s long but very factual and written by a renowned historian, so it&#39;s a good counterweight to some of the more outlandish conspiracy theories you&#39;ll find on the interwebs.</p>

<p>I have my doubts about that. They have been fanatically secretive for hundreds of years. Yes, at this point the family is very large so the wealth has been spread around but how much of it is not known?</p>

<p>There is no benefit for them in advertising how much wealth they have but there are many benefits in hiding it. </p>

<p>What is the wealth of the family when taken in entirety? I imagine it is probably quite large. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about the claims of the Rothschilds owning shares in the Federal Reserve (or any other central banks for that matter), it&#39;s an oft-repeated myth but one I&#39;ve never seen convincing evidence for. I can however comment on the early history of the Rothschilds before they moved into banking at the start of the 19th century.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rothschild expanded banking services to the crown prince in 1769, becoming the court factor, or court banker; since only Jewish people could lend with interest, as the practice of usury was forbidden in Christianity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, the Rothschilds weren&#39;t properly involved in banking until the 1790s. Prior to that they were mainly coin changers and antique dealers, working from their home in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Judengasse">Jewish ghetto in Frankfurt</a> (source: House of Rothschild by Niall Ferguson). As for moneylending being an exclusively Jewish profession, that had not been the case since the 13th century. During the middle ages, in some countries Jews were forced into moneylending because of Christian usury laws that forbade Christians from charging interest. This was also good news for Jews (or so they thought) because generally speaking they were not allowed to practice other professions due to being barred from trade guilds or owning land. This arrangement lasted roughly from the 11th century until the 13th century, when Christian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombards">Lombards</a> from northern Italy invented a clever accounting technique known as &quot;double-entry book-keeping&quot;, a system still used widely today. One of the revolutionary aspects of this new system was that it allowed interest on a loan to be presented in the accounts in such a way that didn&#39;t break the Church&#39;s usury laws, and thus via a clever loop hole Christians were finally able to openly engage in moneylending. This essentially made Jews &quot;surplus to requirements&quot;, and soon after the Lombards moved in, countries in western Europe (including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/6gl7yi/til_in_1290_jews_were_banned_from_england_for_300/dir79p3/?context=3">England in 1290</a>) began to either expel the Jews or, as with the case of the Italian and German states, Jews were banned from moneylending and forced to live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ghettos_in_Europe">segregated ghettos</a> in tremendous poverty. It was also shortly after this period that the Catholic church relaxed the usury laws, and Protestants have never had such restrictions against Christians.</p>

<p>From then onwards, Christian banking flourished and all the largest banking families of Europe were Christian, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugger">Fuggers</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welser">Welsers</a> of Germany, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Medici">Medici</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peruzzi">Peruzzi</a> families of Italy. Modern banking today is largely the legacy of Christian bankers, especially the Lombards who <a href="http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=gkl">developed</a> much of the early banking system in Europe. Modern Jewish involvement in banking didn&#39;t really begin to flourish until the 19th century, when European countries began to tear down the ghettos and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_emancipation">give Jews civil rights</a> for the first time. Many modern &quot;Jewish&quot; banks, particularly in America, started during the 19th century simply because traditional Gentile banks wouldn&#39;t hire Jews.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He began financing wars, lending money to England to hire Hessian mercenaries which were used by England in the American Revolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part is unequivocally false. The Hessian mercenaries were supplied to England by William of Hesse, and the Rothschild&#39;s financial activity at this time was entirely limited to Frankfurt. The only connection that I&#39;m aware of to the Hessian mercenaries happened in 1794, when Rothschild offered to sell a quantity of silver to the Hessian war treasury “at the best possible price.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the 1770s he financed Adam Weishaupt, the man credited with starting the Order of the Illuminati.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the 1770s the Rothschilds were modest antique and coin dealers in the Frankfurt ghetto. I find it extremely unlikely that they financed Weishaupt, who lived hundreds of miles away in Bavaria, as moneylending was not their business, nor were they wealthy enough at that time. Interestingly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati">Illuminati</a> (when it actually existed) banned Jews from joining, something that most secret societies did at the time, including many Freemason lodges. This institutional discrimination against Jews was quite typical of the period, with universities, trade guilds, politics and in fact most public organisations excluding Jewish membership. Things only started to get better in this regards in the 19th century following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_emancipation">emancipation of Jews</a> and the abolishment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ghettos_in_Europe">Jewish ghettos</a> in Europe.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t cover all your points (sorry for the wall of text), but I hope that will be of some help to you.</p>

If I could make one more recommendation, you&#39;ve mentioned Wilhem of Hesse a little already, but his patronage was really crucial to the Rothschild&#39;s early success and deserves a bit more credit imo. After Wilhelm&#39;s father passed away, he inherited an enormous fortune (said to be the second-largest in Europe), which he eventually sought to invest with the help of the Rothschilds. It was with Wilhelm&#39;s money that they branched out to the financial capitals of Europe and allowed them to invest so heavily in government bonds. Carl Rothschild himself declared in 1814 that “the Old Man (meaning Wilhelm) had made our fortune&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In addition to the points <a href="/u/Carthagefield">/u/Carthagefield</a> made above—which I agree with—there are many other falsehoods in the text.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1790 he uttered his famous phrase “Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who makes the laws”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this phrase is unknown until the 20th century. There&#39;s no evidence any Rothschild ever said it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next year, Alexander Hamilton, Rothschilds chief US supporter, created the First Bank of the United States, of which Rothschild and many other English investors had a stake in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Rothschilds had no international presence at this time and were unknown outside of Germany. It&#39;s doubtful that Hamilton ever even heard of the Rothschilds before his death in 1804. He certainly was no supporter of theirs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... and perfected the art of lending to governments during wartime, and having the winner cover the loser’s debt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That almost never happened. Governments have defaulted on debts lots of times, especially after losing wars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nathan almost single-handedly financed the British War effort</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, the war cost more than £80 million pounds a year. The money from Rothschild (from William I) was only a small part of that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>James Madison, president at the time said &quot;History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit and violent means possible, to maintain their control over governments, by controlling money and its issuance.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that quote is from <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:James_Madison#Money_Changers">Olive Cushing Dwinell.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the Rothschilds had a significant stake in the bank, and this was a profitable monopolistic venture, Nathan issued the threat “Either the application for the renewal of the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war”. British Prime Minister Spencer Perceval was against the war, but was unexpectedly assassinated and replaced by Robert Banks Jenkinson, who was for it. Thus beginning the War of 1812, which Nathan of course financed, declaring “Teach these impudent Americans a lesson. Bring them back to colonial status.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is all ridiculous and was a story made up in the late 20th century. The Americans started the War of 1812. All these quotes are complete fabrications. The Rothschilds did not have any significant influence in 1812 and did not have any stake in the first Bank of the U.S. This is an absurd, anachronistic hoax.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a famous story related to Nathan, and that is his famous multi-million dollar trade after the battle of Waterloo in 1815. Essentially, his spies informed him that the British defeated Napoleon before the British government knew. Once he got word of it, he began selling his bonds on the exchange. People suspected this meant Rothschild knew that the British lost, and began a massive sell-off of people scrambling to lock in gains. Once prices reached their lowest, he began buying everything he could get his hands on, right around when news was received that the british actually won the battle of Waterloo. This caused prices on the stock market to skyrocket, making Nathan a tidy multi-million pound profit off the trade. Not bad, for a days work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-rothschild-libel-why-has-it-taken-200-years-for-an-anti-semitic-slur-that-emerged-from-the-10216101.html">contrary to fact.</a> This story started circulating decades after Waterloo. There is a true fact that Nathan Rothschild found out early about Napoleon&#39;s escape from Elba and used that to his financial advantage, but here was no deception involved in that. Also, 100 days passed between Napoleon&#39;s escape and the Battle of Waterloo, not just one day. That might have been the basis for this myth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Sep 10, 1833 Andrew Jackson announced the government would no longer use the Second Bank of the United States, declaring “You are a den of vipers and thieves. I have determined to rout you out, and by the Eternal, I will rout you out!” An assassination attempt was made on Jackson, to which he later claimed he knew it was the Rothschilds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, the Rothschilds had nothing to do with the second Bank of the United States until several years later. Andrew Jackson never said anything bad about the Rothschilds. On the contrary, Jackson had the highest esteem for them and chose the French branch of the Rothschild family to act as agents for the United States in the single largest financial transaction of his administration (a payment from the government of France as part of a treaty settlement).</p>

<p>Jackson did not suspect the Rothschilds as being behind the assassination attempt. He <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xYh2AAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA432&amp;amp;dq=%22senator+Poindexter%22">suspected Senator Poindexter</a>, not the Bank, but a congressional investigation found <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZhHAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=RA1-PA7&amp;amp;lpg=RA1-PA7&amp;amp;dq=%22Not+a+shade+of+suspicion%22">no evidence of any involvement</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When asked on his deathbed what was his greatest accomplishment, he said “I killed the bank”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States would go 80 years without a central bank in what was called the wildcat banking era.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The wildcat banking era is considered to have ended with the creation of the national bank system in 1863.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In response the American civil war, Otto Von Bismarck said “The division of the United States ...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only source for this quote is Conrad Siem, who said (in 1915) that Bismarck told him this 40 years earlier, when Siem was 13 years old. Nobody else remembers Bismarck saying anything like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1861 President Abraham Lincoln approached the Rothschilds to try to obtain loans to support the ongoing American civil war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, August Belmont, who helped the U.S. government finance the war, was also the Rothschilds&#39; agent in the U.S. He did try to get the Rothschilds to finance the U.S., but they declined.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Rothschilds were already financing the south through various agents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, absolutely not. They were even banned the trading of Confederate bonds in their Frankfurt exchange.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They agreed on the condition that Lincoln will charter another US central bank, and would pay 24 to 36% interest on all monies loaned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Myth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lincoln, furious about the high level of interest, decided to print his own debt free money and informed the public this was legal tender for public and private debt, calling them “greenbacks”. By that time next year $449 million greenbacks were printed. Lincoln stated “We gave the people of this republic the greatest blessing they ever had, their own paper money to pay their own debts.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that quote is fake. Congress came up with the Greenback plan. Lincoln reluctantly agreed to it, but was publicly apologetic and said it was a temporary measure. He supported the creation of the federal banking system in 1863.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Rothschilds published the following story in the london times: “If that mischievous financial policy, which had its origin in the North American Republic, should become indurated down to a fixture, then that government will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay off debts and be without a debt. It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce. It will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of civilized governments of the world. The brains and the wealth of all countries will go to North America. That government must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is ridiculous. It&#39;s a hoax from the 1890s, but if you just read it you can tell it&#39;s a hoax. No one would ever write that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1864 Lincoln discovers that the Tsar of Russia, Alexander II, was having problems with the Rothschilds because he was refusing their continual attempts to set up a central bank in Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this is a hoax. Russia was having a conflict with Britain at the time, but it had nothing to do with a central bank.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lincoln asked the Tsar for help, who agreed and anchored his fleet in New York and California, making it clear that if any other country interfered, Russia would side with Lincoln.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lincoln never asked Russia for help. The Russians did send a fleet to the United States, but that was mainly to make sure it wasn&#39;t caught up in a potential British blockade or attack on Russia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a statement to Congress Lincoln said “I have two great enemies, the Southern Army in front of me, and the financial institution in the rear. Of the two, the one in my rear is my greatest foe.”, later that year Lincoln was assassinated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another fake quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On December 22nd 1913, a third central bank was established in the United States, the Federal Reserve. “Federal” being an ironic term, as it is a private company with an estimated profit exceeding $150 billion per year and has never once published its accounts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Federal Reserve includes a federal government agency and twelve quasi-private corporations. The accounts are published every year, of course.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Needless to say the Rothschilds still have shares in the company to this day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, the shares in the 12 corporations are owned by all the Federal Reserve member banks. There are no family or individual shareholders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Woodrow Wilson, president during the creation of the Federal Reserve, later expressed regret over it saying &quot;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this is a fake quote from 30 years after his death.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. ...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are real quotes from before the creation of the Federal Reserve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any estimate of a Rothschilds wealthy is just what they want us to think they have. The US is currently at about $22 Trillion in debt (and climbing rapidly) but thats just what they tell us about. If you also look at all the Shadow Banking (real thing, look it up.) we were actually already passed $100 Trillion in debt BACK IN 2012!!!! IMO Rothschild wealth &quot;estimates&quot; should be multiplied at least 10-15x what they are listed at</p>
