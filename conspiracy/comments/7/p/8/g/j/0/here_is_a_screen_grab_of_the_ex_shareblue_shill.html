    <div class="md"><p>But are you advocating for people not to consider this as legit?</p>

<p>This is a slam dunk for you right?  Bullshit?  </p>

<p>If so, are you telling others to also consider it that way?  Is that the purpose here in conspiracy?  To tell others what to think?</p>

<p>This is subjective.  You can think what you like, others can do the same.</p>

<p>You could tackle this issue if you saw a post claiming this was real/confirmed. That&#39;s where you should be.  Instead, you &quot;know&quot; this is bullshit and are telling others to consider it as such as well.  Later on down the road, we may find out it IS legit! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Q is mossad and communicates directly with Trump, and this is all just a major intelligence operation to convince the only group of people that would normally freak out about martial law, that martial law is a great idea. But that is my pet theory. So, I don&#39;t share everyone else&#39;s enthusiasm for Q. But I&#39;m not going to begrudge my fellows around here their hope and excitement. I think Q has really created a fascinating subculture in the CT community. And he doesn&#39;t really leak stuff, or make a bunch of claims, he just mostly asks questions. </p>

<p>That leads me to the other thing i don&#39;t get. The contrarians just want to yell LARP at everything, deriding Q for not being &quot;right&quot; with their moronic Iamverysmart comments. This displays complete ignorance of what Q has actually been doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What leads you to believe that Q is mossad? Again, I’ll ask for some examples, but It honestly seems plausible which brings up my main beef: people who haven’t accepted the government for years are acting like it’s their friend because their team one. I for one never voted for obama or a democrat. Always third party and once for a republican. Never again ok that red shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no examples, and that is what makes me think this, let me explain. Regardless of how anyone feels about Israel, their power in the geopolitical arena is indisputable. Whether you think they are the good guys or the bad guys doesn&#39;t matter, I think everyone can agree, in a situation like this, that Israel is <em>involved</em>, right? So it would stand to reason Israel, or some of the other zionist groups, would be a part of any conversations related to a deep state war, or a shakeup in the middle east.</p>

<p>But we don&#39;t see that. Q has not mentioned anything related to Israeli influenced organizations <em>at all</em>. Zip. I consider this impossible. </p>

<p>If this has to do with the Bible conspiracy guy yesterday, I was trying to use the socratic method to get him to actually see the answers he should be seeing.

But I bet if you were really felt motivated, you could go through my comments and see that I have a consistent worldview for nearly the whole time I&#39;ve been on Reddit.

<p>That logic is too circular.  How would they know the sources were fake if the sources are anonymous?  NYT is an established pub, they have carte blanche, and the moral majority in press and people in numbers are actually lib.  Did you forget HRC actually won the pop vote?  NYT has been running pro SJW agenda items for the past two years.  They have no credibility with moderates just as 4 chan may not.  Print media is obsolete and they are slicker than you give them credit for.  It&#39;s print propaganda that shovels the rhetorical coal in the furnace of our political fire.  NYT reaches employed bleeding heart liberals.</p>

<p>There is no onus of proof needed on a conspiracy forum, only evidence of theory. </p>

<p>It would do people well to remember that before demanding the unobtainable. </p>

<p>However I agree that a few words on a chan, is not evidence of theory either.</p>

<p>The only thing i took from this screengrab (besides an interesting read) was that it sounded plausible. Beyond that, fuck knows if its real or not. </p>

<p>However the actual theory contained within, is real. In that there is evidence to show that there are companies like Shareblue (or whoever) and how they operate.</p>
