    <div class="md"><p>Of course there&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with being from &quot;x&quot; generation. Just like how everyone blames the Baby-Boomers for everything these days. It&#39;s not their fault, they were just reaping the benefits of a much more fruitful country than what we have now. Anyone would have done that. </p>

<p>Any argument you can make against Millennials all boils down to the sad sad society we currently live in. People used to spend their 20&#39;s having children in their house that they owned, and afforded, with their rewarding career. Now people in their 20&#39;s work at Starbucks and live with their parents because they can&#39;t drop half their income on rent. </p>

<p>71% of Americans made less than $50,000 last year, did you know that? Marriage rates are down, birth rates are down. <strong>So of course</strong> these people in these destitute situations are instead, thrusting themselves into things like individualism and social/political movements and revolutions. Of course they feel <strong>entitled</strong> to a better American Dream than what they&#39;re offered. What even is this country anymore...</p>

<p>I agree with you, but this does not change the fact that most families waste outrageous sums of money on alcohol, cigarettes, other drugs, netflix, fuel for frivolous driving, processed foods, junk toys for kids, videogame subscriptions, and all other manner of completely unnecessary crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anything millennials should be pissed at the other generations because they are inheriting the short straw for what happened under the other generations watch. Yet I hear that ignorance so much, that millennials are the issue. It&#39;s not their fault you can&#39;t work a search browser or don&#39;t know dick about computers. The majority of millennials that I know are holding off their lives (getting married, starting a family, etc.) because the are buried with the work of picking up the slack of a older co-worker that has a family. Seems like they are still being viewed as kids and when older people have families and take time off it is ok, but heaven forbid that the productive millennial wants to enjoy their life. They are a dime a dozen, so that if you don&#39;t want to sell your soul to work for a company they can just move on to the next millennial that is hungry enough that will.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cold game. We all hurt, we all can do better.</p>

<p>You&#39;re a millennial, don&#39;t you want to distance yourself from biased feminist shit? There&#39;s a reason people dislike stereotypes
(e.g. generalizing &quot;Trump supporters are racists&quot; or &quot;left wingers are snowflakes&quot;, etc.).

    <div class="md"><p>its my favorite work of all time.</p>

<p>I was born in the 90s, but chose exile from society at a young age and decided I didn&#39;t like everyone, they were all lying to me, and that I would have to come up with my own belief systems, ethics, and religion.</p>

<p>I did this at about 6 or 7. stuck with it ever since. I almost turned out autistic because I spent such little time socializing until I got older and needed to manipulate people to get what I wanted out of them. it was at that point I realized how sick the world was.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a sociopath, and learning manipulation didn&#39;t come easy. I felt... guilt. sadness for these people who were of lesser intelligence and lacked my true sense of freedom and independence, unbridled by the shackles of accepted law or taboo.</p>

<p>the first thing I noticed when I re-integrated into society was females glorifying behavior and lyrics in songs which degraded them as people. Now, I hate feminists as a true egalitarian, I&#39;ll be honest with you; but the fact that young people were unable to discern good from bad in relation to shit like that was ridiculous. whats more ridiculous is seeing benign normal behavior derided by such groups, yet the major cultural &quot;accomplishments&quot; which basically amount to fecal murals on a bathroom wall, are not and these people are &quot;good role models with talent&quot; lmao.</p>

<p>eventually I realized that even more evil people than me would just take what I wanted anyways and leave others used, abused, and hurt. so I figured if I was straightforward and didn&#39;t mislead people too much, being a bit evil wouldn&#39;t hurt as long as it served my end purposes.</p>

<p>in the end, I still choose exile anyway. I don&#39;t want friends unless they have something for me. Everything I try to smile or laugh with them about is mostly a fraud anyway. I have few friends, and among them are only those who also count as heretics.</p>
