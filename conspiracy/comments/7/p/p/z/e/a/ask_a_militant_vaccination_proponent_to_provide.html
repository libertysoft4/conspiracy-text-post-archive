<p>BULLSHIT.</p>

<p>Catching the measles provides lifelong immunity. No aluminum, mercury, or &quot;other undisclosed ingredients&quot; necessary.</p>

<p>Sounds like some people lost sight of the science behind why vaccines originally became a thing.</p>

<p>Why not just get rid of the toxins and secret ingredients and go back to legit science?</p>

<p><strong>Offer vaccines without the toxic adjuvants and secret ingredients and watch the anti-vax crowd disappear overnight.</strong></p>

<p>Edit: (examples of the deafening silence below)</p>

<p>Edit 2:  After 3 hrs, no vaccine representative has offered to disclose the secret ingredients.  This is an admission of eugenics as per the OP.  Still hoping someone with balls will step up to the plate, but so far no dice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This tired argument shows your utter ignorance on the subject. </p>

<p>&quot;Since injected Al adjuvant is not eliminated in the feces, about 94% and 78% of  the AlOH and AlPO4, respectively, remained in the rabbits after 28 days. The aluminum was not eliminated in a few days, as claimed by the Oxford Vaccine Group.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The safety of injected aluminum adjuvant must be determined from experiments with injected aluminum adjuvant (insoluble and persistent), not ingested, water-soluble aluminum. Scientific studies have established that injected aluminum adjuvant has unique toxic properties and ways of moving around the body (“kinetics”) that are not the same as ingested water-soluble aluminum. Studies demonstrating the unique toxicity and kinetics of aluminum adjuvant are described in these articles:&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aluminum adjuvant nanoparticles are very different from dissolved aluminum ions. Consequently, the only scientifically-valid way to establish the safety of injected aluminum adjuvant, is by experiments with injected aluminum adjuvant. Studies of ingested, soluble aluminum salts cannot establish the safety of Al adjuvant. Models of only dissolved aluminum cannot be used to determine the toxicity of the particles. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, because aluminum in the brain is just completely harmless. </p>

<p>&quot;Concerns regarding vaccine safety have emerged following reports of potential adverse events in both humans and animals. In the present study, alum, alum-containing vaccine and alum adjuvant tagged with fluorescent nanodiamonds were used to evaluate i) the persistence time at the injection site, ii) the translocation of alum from the injection site to lymphoid organs, and iii) the behavior of adult CD1 mice following intramuscular injection of alum (400 μg Al/kg). Results showed for the first time a strikingly delayed systemic translocation of adjuvant particles. Alum-induced granuloma remained for a very long time in the injected muscle despite progressive shrinkage from day 45 to day 270. Concomitantly, a markedly delayed translocation of alum to the draining lymph nodes, major at day 270 endpoint, was observed. Translocation to the spleen was similarly delayed (highest number of particles at day 270). In contrast to C57BL/6J mice, no brain translocation of alum was observed by day 270 in CD1 mice. Consistently neither increase of Al cerebral content, nor behavioral changes were observed. On the basis of previous reports showing alum neurotoxic effects in CD1 mice, an additional experiment was done, and showed early brain translocation at day 45 of alum injected subcutaneously at 200 μg Al/kg. This study confirms the striking biopersistence of alum. It points out an unexpectedly delayed diffusion of the adjuvant in lymph nodes and spleen of CD1 mice, and suggests the importance of mouse strain, route of administration, and doses, for future studies focusing on the potential toxic effects of aluminum-based adjuvants..&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Proof of children dying &quot;en masse?&quot; Actually, infant mortality is higher in countries with more vaccinations.</p>

<p>The infant mortality rate (IMR) is one of the most important indicators of the socio-economic well-being and public health conditions of a country. The US childhood immunization schedule specifies 26 vaccine doses for infants aged less than 1 year—the most in the world—yet 33 nations have lower IMRs. Using linear regression, the immunization schedules of these 34 nations were examined and a correlation coefficient of r = 0.70 (p &lt; 0.0001) was found between IMRs and the number of vaccine doses routinely given to infants. Nations were also grouped into five different vaccine dose ranges: 12–14, 15–17, 18–20, 21–23, and 24–26. The mean IMRs of all nations within each group were then calculated. Linear regression analysis of unweighted mean IMRs showed a high statistically significant correlation between increasing number of vaccine doses and increasing infant mortality rates, with r = 0.992 (p = 0.0009). Using the Tukey-Kramer test, statistically significant differences in mean IMRs were found between nations giving 12–14 vaccine doses and those giving 21–23, and 24–26 doses. A closer inspection of correlations between vaccine doses, biochemical or synergistic toxicity, and IMRs is essential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>British Medical Journal. This information is freely available. </p>

<p>&quot;Despite the agency’s disclaimer, the CDC does receive millions of dollars in industry gifts and funding, both directly and indirectly, and several recent CDC actions and recommendations have raised questions about the science it cites, the clinical guidelines it promotes, and the money it is taking.</p>

<p>Marcia Angell, former editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, told The BMJ, “The CDC has enormous credibility among physicians, in no small part because the agency is generally thought to be free of industry bias. Financial dealings with biopharmaceutical companies threaten that reputation.”2</p>

<p>Industry funding of the CDC has taken many doctors, even some who worked for CDC, by surprise. Philip Lederer, an infectious diseases fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, and a former CDC epidemic intelligence service officer, told The BMJ he was “saddened” to learn of industry funding.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s right.  Due to shitty mumps vaccine efficacy to begin with (Google the Merck mumps vaccine lawsuit for more details on that) , and on top of fading immunity for those who might have originally had it, the medical industry is now recommending a third dose of that which is failing us currently.</p>

<p>And mind you, it’s not going to be a dedicated dose of mumps vaccine this time.  Nope.  It’s gonna be another dose of the three-way thing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The link to the mump vaccine makes it seem pretty ineffective.  Just a couple quotes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mumps outbreaks can still occur in highly vaccinated U.S. communities, </p>

<p>waning immunity following vaccination</p>

<p>one dose is 78% (range: 49% to 92%) effective</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure what point you are trying to make, but a vaccine that is 49% effective and loses that effectiveness as time goes by, and does not actually stop outbreaks in highly vaccinated groups is kind of worthless.  One of the know site effect is permanent brain damage, so if you want to risk it, fine.  But you want to force me to risk permanent brain damage? For a vaccine that is not effective?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines are literally killing children too. And these are just the deaths that were actually reported after vaccination, because most doctors are unwilling to link the two. </p>

<p>&quot;VAERS received 2149 death reports, most (n = 1469 [68.4%]) in children. Median age was 0.5 years (range, 0–100 years); males accounted for 1226 (57%) reports. The total annual number of death reports generally decreased during the latter part of the study period. Most common causes of death among 1244 child reports with available death certificates/autopsy reports included sudden infant death syndrome (n = 544 [44%]), asphyxia (n = 74 [6.0%]), septicemia (n = 61 [4.9%]), and pneumonia (n = 57 [4.6%]). Among 526 adult reports, most common causes of death included diseases of the circulatory (n = 247 [46.9%]) and respiratory systems (n = 77 [14.6%]), certain infections and parasitic diseases (n = 62 [11.8%]), and malignant neoplasms (n = 20 [3.8%]). For child death reports, 79.4% received &gt;1 vaccine on the same day. Inactivated influenza vaccine given alone was most commonly associated with death reports in adults (51.4%).&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing how you cut this off after the important part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Background. <strong>Vaccines are among the safest medical products in use today. Hundreds of millions of vaccinations are administered in the United States each year. Serious adverse reactions are uncommon. However, temporally associated deaths can occur following vaccination. Our aim was to characterize main causes of death among reports submitted to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system.</strong></p>

<p>Methods. We searched VAERS for US reports of death after any vaccination from 1 July 1997 through 31 December 2013. Available medical records, autopsy reports, and death certificates were reviewed to identify cause of death.</p>

<p>The fact you&#39;re a mod for innocuous subs making vehemently emotional pleas For The Children is something r/conspiracy is gonna notice and call attention to.  That doesn&#39;t make you a shill, that makes us aware of who is speaking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;DESCRIPTION
M-M-R
®
II
    (Measles,  Mumps,  and  Rubella  Virus  Vaccine  Live)  is  a  live  virus  vaccine  for  vaccination<br/>
against measles (rubeola), mumps, and rubella (German measles).
M-M-R 
II
   is a sterile lyophilized preparation of (1)
 ATTENUVAX
® (Measles Virus Vaccine Live), a more 
attenuated  line  of  measles  virus,  derived  from  Enders&#39;  attenuated  Edmonston  strain  and  propagated  in<br/>
chick embryo cell culture; (2)
 MUMPSVAX
® (Mumps Virus Vaccine Live), the Jer
yl Lynn
™ 
(B level) strain 
of  mumps  virus  propagated  in  chick  embryo  cell  culture;  and  (3)
 MERUVAX
® 
II
    (Rubella  Virus  Vaccine<br/>
Live),  the  Wistar  RA
 27/3  strain  of  live  attenuated  rubella  virus  propagated  in  WI
-38  human  diploid  lung<br/>
fibroblasts
.{1,2}
The  grow
th  medium  for  measles  and  mumps  is  Medium  199  (a  buffered  salt  solution  containing<br/>
vitamins  and  amino  acids  and  supplemented  with  fetal  bovine  serum)  containing  SPGA  (sucrose,<br/>
phosphate, glutamate, and recombinant human albumin) as stabilizer and neomycin.
The  growth  medium  for  rubella  is  Minimum  Essential  Medium  (MEM)  [a  buffered  salt  solution<br/>
containing  vitamins  and  amino  acids  and  supplemented  with  fetal  bovine  serum]  containing  recombinant<br/>
human albumin and neomycin. Sorbitol and hydrolyzed gelatin stabilizer are added to the individual virus 
harvests.
The cells, virus pools, and fetal bovine serum are all screened for the absence of adventitious agents.
The reconstituted vaccine is for subcutaneous administration. Each 0.5 
mL dose contains not less than 
1,000 
TCID
50
  (tissue  culture  infectious  doses)  of  measles  virus;  12,500 
TCID
50
  of  mumps  virus;  and<br/>
1,000 
TCID
50
 of rubella virus. Each dose of the vaccine is calculated to contain sorbitol (14.5 
mg), sodium 
phosphate, sucrose (1.9 
mg), sodium chloride, hy
drolyzed gelatin (14.5 
mg), recombinant human albumin 
(
≤
0.3 
mg), fetal bovine serum (&lt;1 
ppm), other buffer and media ingredients and approximately 25 
mcg of 
neomycin. The product contains no preservative.
Before reconstitution, the lyophilized vaccine is a light yellow compact crystalline plug. M-
M-R 
II
, when 
reconstituted as directed, is clear yellow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;ADVERSE REACTIONS 
The  following  adverse  reactions  are  listed  in  decreasing  order  of
 severity, without regard to causality, 
within each body system category and have been reported during clinical trials, with use of the marketed 
vaccine, or with use of monovalent or bivalent vaccine containing measles, mumps, or rubella:
Body as a Whole 
Panniculitis; atypical measles; fever; syncope; headache; dizziness; malaise; irritability.
Cardiovascular System 
Vasculitis.
Digestive System 
Pancreatitis; diarrhea; vomiting; parotitis; nausea.
Endocrine System 
Diabetes mellitus.
Hemic and Lymphatic System
Thrombocytopenia   (see   WARNINGS,<br/>
Thrombocytopenia
);   purpura;   regional   lymphadenopathy;<br/>
leukocytosis.
Immune System 
Anaphylaxis  and  anaphylactoid  reactions  have  been  reported  as  well  as  related  phenomena  such  as<br/>
angioneurotic  edema  (including  peripheral  or
  facial  edema)  and  bronchial  spasm  in  individuals  with  or<br/>
without an allergic history.
Musculoskeletal System 
Arthritis; arthralgia; myalgia.
Arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of infection 
wit
h wild
-type rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and sex, being greatest in adult females 
and least in prepubertal children. This type of involvement as well as myalgia and paresthesia, have also 
been reported following administration of MER
UVAX
II
.<br/>
Chronic arthritis has been associated with wild-
type rubella infection and has been related to persistent 
virus  and/or  viral  antigen  isolated  from  body  tissues.  Only  rarely  have  vaccine  recipients  developed<br/>
chronic joint symptoms.
Following  vaccination  in  children,  reactions  in  joints  are  uncommon  and  generally  of  brief  duration.  In<br/>
women,  incidence  rates  for  arthritis  and  arthralgia  are  generally  higher  than  those  seen  in  children<br/>
(children:  0-
3%;  women:  12-
26%),
{17,56
,57}  and  the  reactions  tend  t
o  be  more  marked  and  of  longer<br/>
duration. Symptoms may persist for a matter of months or on rare occasions for years. In adolescent girls, 
the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence between those seen in children and in adult women. 
Even  in  women<br/>
older  than  35 
years,  these  reactions  are  generally  well  tolerated  and  rarely  interfere  with<br/>
normal activities.<br/>
Nervous System 
Encephalitis;      encephalopathy;      measles      inclusion      body      encephalitis      (MIBE)      (see<br/>
CONTRAINDICATIONS);  subacute  sclerosing  panencephal
itis  (SSPE);  Guillain
-Barré  Syndrome  (GBS);<br/>
acute   disseminated   encephalomyelitis
   (ADEM); 
transverse   myelitis;   febrile   convulsions;   afebrile<br/>
convulsions or seizures; ataxia; polyneuritis; polyneuropathy; ocular palsies; paresthesia.
Encephalitis and 
encephalopathy have been reported approximately once for every 3 million doses of 
M-M-R  II  or  measles
-,  mumps
-,  and  rubella-
containing  vaccine  administered  si
nce  licensure  of  these<br/>
vaccines
.<br/>
The  risk  of  serious  neurological  disorders  following  live  measles  virus
 vaccine administration remains 
less  than  the  risk  of  encephalitis  and  encephalopathy  following  infection  wit
h  wild
-type  measles  (
1  per 
1000 
reported cases).
{58,
59}
In  severely  immunocompromised  individuals  who  have  been  inadvertently  vaccinated  with  measl
es-
containing  vaccine;
  measles  inclusion  body  encephalitis,  pneumonitis,  and  fatal  outcome  as  a  direct<br/>
consequence    of    disseminated    measles    vaccine    virus    infection    have    been    reported    (see<br/>
CONTRAINDICATIONS)
. In this population, disseminated mumps and rubell
a vaccine virus infection have
also been reported.
There have been reports of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in children who did not have a 
history  of  infection  with  wild-
type  measles  but  did  receive  measles  vaccine.  Some  of  these  cases  may<br/>
hav
e resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or possibly from the measles vaccination. 
Based  on  estimated  nationwide  measles  vaccine  distribution,  the  association  of  SSPE  cases  to  measles<br/>
vaccination  is  about  one  case  per  million  vaccine<br/>
doses  distributed.  This  is  far  less  than  the  association<br/>
with infection with wild
-type measles, 6-
22 cases of SSPE per million cases of measles. The results of a 
retrospective case-
controlled study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest 
that the overall effect of measles vaccine has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its

Cases  of  aseptic  meningitis  have  been  reported  to  VAERS  following  measles,  mumps,  and  rubella<br/>
vaccination.  Although  a  causal  relationship  between  the  Urabe  strain  of  mumps  vaccine  and  aseptic<br/>
meningitis  has  been  shown,  there  is  no  evidence 
to  link  Jeryl  Lynn™ 
mumps  vaccine  to  aseptic<br/>
meningitis.

Death  from  various,  and  in  some  cases  unknown,  causes  has  been  reported  rarely  following<br/>
vaccination  with  measles,  mumps,  and  rubella  vaccines;  however,  a  causal  relationship  has  not  been<br/>
established  in  healthy  individuals (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). No deaths or permanent sequelae were 
reported  in  a  published  post
-marketing  surveillance  study  in  Finland  involving  1.5 
million  children  and<br/>
adults who were vaccinated with M-
M-R

   during 1982 
to 1993.

Under the Nati
onal Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, health-
care providers and manufacturers are 
required to record and report certain suspected adverse events occurring within specific time periods after 
vaccination.  However,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human 
Services  (DHHS)  has  established  a<br/>
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) which will accept all reports of suspected events.

A VAERS report form as well as information regarding reporting requirements can be obtained by calling

<p>EDIT: For those wondering, this is not bad, this is normal, this is proper science, and this guy doesn&#39;t really understand that they wouldn&#39;t be able to create the vaccine without certain ingredients that he keeps calling &quot;Secret&quot;.</p>

<p>Secondly, OP keeps calling things secret, I just listed everything used, tell me whats secret? I think OP also missed: &quot;The cells, virus pools, and fetal bovine serum are all screened for the absence of adventitious agents.&quot;</p>

<p>I have a feeling they would look at you and be speechless because they would be trying to explain something to someone who is clearly ignorant of the fundamental basis for vaccine production. </p>

<p>I call it secret, you call it...undisclosed or &quot;other&quot;.</p>

<p>Same shit.</p>

<p>Catching the measles provides lifelong immunity. No aluminum, mercury, or &quot;other undisclosed ingredients&quot; necessary.</p>

<p>Sounds like you lost sight of the science behind why vaccines originally became a thing.</p>

<p>Why not just get rid of the toxins and go back to legit science?</p>

<p>Try again.</p>

<p>Vaccines aren&#39;t 100% safe, they are just far far safer than the alternative. Children have died from vaccines, far more have died from vaccine preventable diseases.</p>
