        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It may not be strictly conspirational (or it may), but has it ever bugged anyone else where slang words and idiosyncracies (like specific word inflections etc) come from and how it&#39;s possible that they get so very popular and widespread? It defies all reason. </p>

<p>Who is the first person to come up with such terms? I often see people using slang words. But I don&#39;t remember ever knowing anyone who successfully created a neologism of any sort that became used even inside his social circle.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like slang words simply exist and people first don&#39;t know them, and then they do know them. </p>

<p>And while slang or certain idiosyncracies is implicitly &quot;cool&quot;, creating neologisms that nobody understands is kind of the opposite and makes you look weird. </p>

<p>So where do these come from? Someone with the power to do so has to be spreading them somehow, from somewhere. Right? I can&#39;t imagine it being purely &quot;viral&quot;. Because if it was, after all, it should be easier in life to observe instances where new words are &quot;generated&quot;. More importantly though, you would then expect slang to only be meaningful in small social circles, not across entire populations (except maybe for a few exceptions).</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s about celebrities/famous people using them? And others adapt those? Does that sound right-ish? But then, how do they come up with them and how do they know they will be accepted beforehand? It&#39;s almost some kind of black magic lol.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so very strange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One kid says it (usually the cool one), another kid emulates them.. and so it spreads. 
When you have a large &amp; sociable youth tribe full of impressionable kids wanting to fit in , you can imagine how quickly it takes hold. </p>

<p>Sometimes (such as in the instance of &#39;Yo&#39;), they stretch back hundreds of years, often nearly dying out only to be resurrected by a new culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mh figures I wouldn&#39;t know much about it, never been the cool one. Still seems kinda top-to-bottom distribution. Hmmm. And who defines what kid is cool, right?

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. </p>

<p>And its not just cockneys that have rhyming slang, although they are the best known for it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard rhyming slang from other places such as Newcastle in the north of UK. I&#39;ve even heard some in smaller towns in Ireland. </p>

<p>Quite a bizarre form of language play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about this before. I believe there is much more to language and than most people grasp. It interests me as well how certain words, terms, phrases ect. came to be popular. I don&#39;t think all of them were by coincidence. If words have weight, there could potentially be implications for certain words to be commonly used. Check out the rice experiment. Truthstream media just made a video about it. More so intent I guess than just language, but still. Interesting as hell.</p>

<p>But yeah I totalyl agree it&#39;s interesting as hell. And I am pretty sure not all of them were coincidence too. Come think about it, what does coincidence even mean? Isn&#39;t that kind of a cop-out in terms of explanation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you might want to look into internet meme culture for a part of your answer. With the internet, we have records so we can track terms down, forum posts, and videos, to try and find the origins of these things. With memes, it generally starts with one person saying or doing something in a small part of the web, maybe not even ironically at first. Sometimes it is picked up by others quickly, other times it percolates for weeks or months in different areas of the net, with a 2nd reference here, a 3rd there, each one closer than the last and connected by the different forums and sites each user overlaps with the other. </p>

<p>Eventually, it reaches critical mass, and the &quot;main stream&quot; of people get on board with it, and before you know it you have millions of people emulating something. I think with language you can take this trend but extrapolate it into a longer time frame...instead of days or weeks, we&#39;re looking at months or years of a word stewing in a small community, maybe a suburb, which spreads to other suburbs, then a city, then a county, a state, then an entire region and finally the whole country. </p>
