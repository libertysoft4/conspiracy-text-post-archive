        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As a very long time subscriber of this sub, I&#39;ve got to say I&#39;m thoroughly dismayed at the results of the submission statement rule that has been placed on all submissions to this sub.</p>

<p>The content has almost entirely dried up. I used to be able to come here and browse the new section, and see 20+ posts every hour here. Granted a lot of them were shit posts, but almost always there was a decently good post every hour or so. The community usually did a fantastic job at weeding out the shit posts, and up-voting the good ones.</p>

<p>Since this submission statement rule has been in place, the content here has almost completely dried up.  I can come here now every hour or so, and see on average only 5-10 posts each hour, especially after 3 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve recently been lurking on <a href="/r/CBTS_Stream">/r/CBTS_Stream</a>, and a sub that only has 10,000+ subscribers, it has 32 posts in the last hour, compared to this sub which has over 560,000 subscribers that has only 22 posts in the last hour. I don&#39;t even subscribe to Q-Anon LARP, and don&#39;t care for most of the posts at <a href="/r/CBTS_Stream">/r/CBTS_Stream</a>, but it&#39;s not even close how much content is being submitted there, compared to here.</p>

<p>The community was doing just fine at weeding out the shit posts before this submission statement, why the need to place this restriction on new posts here? This restriction is almost an insult to the intelligence of the subscribers here. Supposedly we as a community can&#39;t decipher shit posts from spam, so the mods had to place restrictions on the flow of information here?</p>

<p>The mods here said a week or so ago that it was the holidays and to give it a chance, well the holidays are over now, and this new rule has significantly slowed  the flow of information here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just curious how everyone else feels about the effects this new submission statement on this sub. If anyone else noticing the same thing I am?</p>

<p>comeyistitor had like 5 comments total to the sub and was banned for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mynnf/what_is_this_from_anthony_weiners_laptop/">this post</a>, which isn&#39;t at all what he claimed it was in the OP and is thus a misleading, fabricated shitpost.

<p>I&#39;ve said this once already. That sub is incredibly fishy. I visited it a few weeks ago, and many of the users had accounts  that were &gt;1 month old. I&#39;m talking like 90% of the names I clicked on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not disagreeing with you that it&#39;s simple enough to submit a submission statement. It literally takes me an extra 5 minutes max to do, I&#39;m just saying that the amount of content being submitted here has been drastically reduced because of it.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was bots or David Brock that was previously submitting links here, I don&#39;t know who it was too be honest.  I just trusted this sub to be able to weed out the shit posts, and up-vote the good posts that it didn&#39;t matter to me who was submitting it.</p>

<p>Same thing with CBTS_Stream, I definitely agree with you about that sub, I was looking at the exact same thing last night, the majority of the posters there had accounts created since November or December, but that doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that it&#39;s a dynamic sub. I think that sub has nowhere near the discernment that this sub does, and shit posts get to the front page quite frequently there. This sub however isn&#39;t like that. The users here know a shit post when they see it.</p>

<p>Your statement should be: I&#39;m just saying that the amount of SHITTY content being submitted here has been drastically reduced because of it. </p>

<p>There is a reason the submission statements started. Because the sub wasn&#39;t good enough at weeding out shit posts. </p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s been pretty quite around here since, and I&#39;m not sure exactly how I feel about it, tbh. To be honest, it feels more like it did ~2 years ago, traffic wise, but... obviously during that time, the numbers were drastically lower (like in the &lt;= 1,800 tops) range. Makes you think about all the bots and shit accounts &quot;idling&quot; by... Just waiting. Ultimately, IMHO, I think all numbers are cooked. Reddit is trying to go public... I think cutting both numbers in half, is a more legit/honest stat.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the exact opposite. Instead of removing content for stating an opinion, we are removing content for <strong>not</strong> stating an opinion. We want people to explain the purpose of their post. This deters spammers and initiates a conversation. No post will be removed with a submission statement unless that submission statement breaks the rules that apply to all comments. </p>

Suppression and then some sort of consensus via government or community that an item is harmful or offensive.  The second part we have, bots spamming links is harmful to the community for example.  The suppression part is what is missing here.  There is no content not allowed.  </p>

<p>That’s all good dude. I don’t think you’ll find any genuinely suppressed info as a result of the submission statement. T_D shills are certainly working hard to try to portray it that way, but the mod logs are public for everyone to see.</p>

<p>It’s funny, I often apparently come across as anti-T_D, but I’d say I am equally critical of all stupidity. I’d happily call a liberal out just as much as a conservative. But I’ll be damned if the conservatives here are quite a bit stupider than the liberals. I suppose T_D isn’t exactly sending us their best and brightest here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, as it were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reducing the amount of &quot;content&quot; was one of the main purposes of the rule.  Quality over quantity.  Before, bots were posting dozens of links per day to Donald Trump/Hillary tweets and other stupid political propaganda and spam.  Spammers were posting links to random unsourced blogs.  Now they need to explain to the sub why those posts are relevant and why we should care.</p>

<p>Part of the reason I&#39;ve hung around this sub for the last 4 years or so, was the fact that it was always frequently updated with new information, which the overwhelming majority of users here discerned, and up-voted articles and links I found interesting.</p>

<p>I guess my biggest concern is that when you added this rule, and the flow of information has slowed down to a trickle, you&#39;ve taken the ability of this sub to collectively determine what is spam, and what is propaganda.</p>

<p>I personally feel confident that I&#39;m capable of discerning this myself, and if I feel it&#39;s spam or propaganda, I simply down vote and move on to a post I do find interesting and worthwhile.  I don&#39;t exert any more time or energy on it.</p>

<p>What is meaningful about a random tweet by Donald Trump or Hillary about some partisan issue?  What is meaningful about a random youtube video with poor editing and no coherent message?  What is meaningful about a spam bot posting dozens of links per day to farm karma without even caring or knowing what they&#39;re posting?</p>

<p>A better question: what &quot;meaningful&quot; posts do you think rule 13 is preventing?  Anyone can still post whatever they want as long as they take 30 seconds to explain to us why it&#39;s relevant and why we should care.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Has nothing to do with that.  You&#39;ve been on reddit for this long and you still trust the upvotes and downvotes to do the job?  If you hadn&#39;t noticed, reddit is insanely easy to game.  Anything can be upvoted to the top of the sub, anything can be buried.  There is no organic curation of content anymore, hasn&#39;t been for a few years at least.</p>

<p>The sub was being flooded with political spam and other shitposting and karma whoring.  &quot;Downvote and move on&quot; wasn&#39;t solving the problem, something needed to be done.</p>

<p>Has nothing to do with that. You&#39;ve been on reddit for this long and you still trust the upvotes and downvotes to do the job? If you hadn&#39;t noticed, reddit is insanely easy to game. Anything can be upvoted to the top of the sub, anything can be buried.</p>

<p>Of course.  I&#39;m not saying the curation of content is strictly organic.  I&#39;m not saying that quality posts can&#39;t be buried.  I&#39;m not saying there wasn&#39;t / still is shit posts being made here. I&#39;m not saying that I trust the upvotes and downvotes.  I&#39;m saying that I trust myself to be able to discern what&#39;s a good post and what&#39;s a shit post.  </p>

<p>The sub was being flooded with political spam and other shitposting and karma whoring.</p>

<p>I rarely heard any of the users complaining of this.  If you have examples of long time users making this complaint, I&#39;d love to see them.  The only ones I saw complaining about this, were the MODS.  I&#39;m willing to bet a majority of users here have no problem at all with the &quot;Downvote and move on&quot; strategy.  If they felt it was spam or propaganda, why would they waste any more time or energy worrying about something they&#39;ve dismissed already as not important?</p>

<p>If you have any examples of users complaining about the status of the sub pre-rule 13, I&#39;d sure like to see them.</p>

<p>I know, I was asking you to tell me, subjectively, what is meaningful about any of those things I mentioned.  Obviously I wanted to hear your personal opinion.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s good, I hope that everyone has that ability and if they don&#39;t I hope that they will at some point.  The issue was quality/shit ratio.  There was way too much spam and white noise being posted.  As just one example: why should we allow spam bots to continually game the system for their own benefit?  R13 has stopped them from posting almost completely.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Are you serious?  There were complaints every time one of these shitposts or spam posts were on the front page, with comments asking why these spammers were allowed to keep posting and lamenting the fact that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was a shell of its former self.  If you didn&#39;t see all of those complaints you must not have been looking.</p>

<p>Why would you be willing to bet that?  The overwhelming response to R13 has been positive, so clearly lots of users here feel like it&#39;s an improvement on the &quot;downvote and move on&quot; strategy that wasn&#39;t working at all.</p>

<p>2nd top comment: &quot;Cool, a trump tweet. Quality content here.&quot;  Dozens of responses below it agreeing with that poster.</p>

<p>top comment: &quot;As OP is well aware, Byrd turned his life around, denounced the KKK, and fought for civil rights. The NAACP mourned his death when he died. Get this the_donald bullshit outta here. Such a desperate reach.&quot;</p>

<p>Point is SS is still censorship</p>

<p>It&#39;s the exact opposite. Instead of removing content for stating an opinion, we are removing content for <strong>not</strong> stating an opinion. We want people to explain the purpose of their post. This deters spammers and initiates a conversation. No post will be removed with a submission statement unless that submission statement breaks the rules that apply to all comments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that is what you define as censorship then I really don&#39;t think you understand what censorship is.  Censorship has two parts to it.  Suppression and then some sort of consensus via government or community that an item is harmful or offensive.  The second part we have, bots spamming links is harmful to the community for example.  The suppression part is what is missing here.  There is no content not allowed.  </p>
