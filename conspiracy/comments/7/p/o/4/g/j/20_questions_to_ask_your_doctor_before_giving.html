    <div class="md"><p>Many stone fruits contain toxic chemicals: cyanide. And yet we eat them. Why do you think that is?</p>

<p>People have tried very, very hard to find proof of bad effects of these vaccines, and yet there have been no significant side effects discovered.</p>

<p>Those studies that did show it were later demonstrated to have falsified their data.</p>

<p>So whatever&#39;s in vaccines (as in the case of stone fruits), it hasn&#39;t demonstrably hurt us, and it <em>has</em> demonstrably helped us.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but I haven&#39;t exactly been looking either to be fair. Based on the few studies I&#39;ve glossed over, I&#39;m wary of vaccines, and separately have my own negative personal experiences with other hardcore pharmaceuticals. I am most concerned with seemingly irrelevant adjuvants such as peanuts, as peanut allergies have progressed to the point where you can&#39;t even bring a plate of cookies to a public function for fear of sending someone into anaphylactic shock. </p>

<p>Despite an autoimmune condition that&#39;s thrice come close to taking my life, I&#39;m drug free, though have never felt better. In my situation, there wasn&#39;t a correlation between medicine and healing. I don&#39;t discount the concept of vaccines, but the careless execution of the idea is what concerns me. Equally frightening is the money behind these drugs. Profits outweigh human cost up to a certain point, and I find this to be abhorrent. </p>

<p>Also, whenever you ask such &quot;controversial&quot; questions, <strong>always</strong> preface with &quot;can I ask you <em>personal</em> questions?&quot; or &quot;can I have your own personal, private opinion on something?&quot; This will typically prevent them from hiding behind &quot;the medical community&quot; (or whatever collective humans are often tempted to delegate their minds/conscience to).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Had a self-described Merck executive show up on my fb feed a few days ago ranting incoherently when I dared question the schedule and vaccine makers lack of accountability. When asked to address those specific issues, he had no argument whatsoever and devolved instantly into an ad hominem attack. He clearly felt personally attacked by the concept of accountability and tried to lump me in as an anti-vaxxer.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the funny part: I&#39;m completely pro-vax. My kids are fully vaxxed (although not according to the schedule), I&#39;m fully vaxxed, hell even my cats are fully vaxxed. I think it&#39;s reasonable to question the schedule as there&#39;s very little research into it so far. I would go so far to say that if as a parent you haven&#39;t researched and questioned the schedule, you aren&#39;t doing your parental due diligence. And I find the special court and laws surrounding vaccine manufacturer&#39;s accountability HIGHLY suspect. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even get a chance to mention that I think the government requiring vaccines is fundamentally immoral, as I had to cut him off after the ad hom. Dude obviously had no idea what to do with a nuanced position. I was either with him or against him, and if I dared question the authority of Big Pharma, I was automatically an uneducated, uninformed anti-vaxxer in his eyes. </p>

<p>The lesson I had reinforced from this experience: People within any given industry or profession are the first line of propaganda. They vehemently believe it themselves as their own self-worth depends on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are afraid of diseases. The thought that, &quot;If you/your kids don&#39;t get vaccinated, then me/my kids will die!&quot; is enough to short circuit any interest someone might have in people&#39;s medical rights or investigating whether vaccines might be less than perfect in every way.</p>

<p>I&#39;m scared of diseases, too, but I think the right approach is for society to pressure people to stay home when they&#39;re sick, to wear a mask while they&#39;re sick, and in the case of Ebola, quarantine.</p>

<p>Most deadly illnesses start off looking like regular illnesses, so if people routinely stay home with mild ones then when someone catches something deadly but thinks it&#39;s not, they&#39;ll stay home anyway and it won&#39;t spread.</p>

<p>Also, you may want to look into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act">National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act</a>, and ask yourself whether it was enacted by Reagan to defend patients, or pharmaceutical companies.</p>
