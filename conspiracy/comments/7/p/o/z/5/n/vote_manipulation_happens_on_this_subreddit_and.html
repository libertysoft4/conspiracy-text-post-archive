        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Give this a try.</p>

<p>Find a thread that deals with a controversial topic. This is r/conspiracy, so that should be easy. Topics calling out zionism, paid shilling, or vaccine safety are good candidates for this little experiment.</p>

<p>Go through and give upvotes to comments and users calling out these conspiracies. Refresh the page and make sure your upvotes are still there. Take careful note of which comments and users you have upvoted. Now, wait a little while. Ten minutes should do it. Now go back to that thread and take a look at all the comments you have upvoted. You may be surprised (or not) to find that some of the upvotes you have given are no longer there.</p>

<p>Why does this happen? If anyone has a mundane explanation that isn&#39;t targeted vote manipulation, I&#39;m all ears. I&#39;ve tried this across many different subreddits and what I&#39;ve noticed is that it only happens in conspiratorial topics. I&#39;ve also noticed that it targets specific users as well. I sure as shit haven&#39;t seen it in r/aww.</p>

<p>Again, if there is a legitimate reason that this would be happening, I&#39;d love to hear it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Just to be perfectly clear, when I say your upvote disappears, I mean literally your orange upvote arrow will no longer be selected. It is as if you never clicked it at all. It does not return if you refresh the page. It only returns if you re-upvote the comment. I have yet to see upvotes disappear on comments I have re-</p>

<p>like really dawg, it isnt that hard recording that.i really want to see something interesting, so if you can make sure to record that and prove to all of us that &quot;vote manipulation&quot; exists in the form you mentioned!</p>

<p>I have noticed this phenomenon and have noted it in the past. In fact, recently I commented on the fact that I was looking for a particular thread that I knew a particular user that I had upvoted had commented in. I went to that users history as a shortcut to said thread and found several pages of blue arrows- as if I had downvoted every comment this user had made for 24 hours. I know for a fact that I have never downvoted this person.</p>

<p>Now, how do I prove this with a screenshot? What is to say that I didn&#39;t just fake the downvotes and take a shot of it?</p>

<p>i never had that happen to me, and ive never heard of anyone having that happen to them. and assuming it ever did, how the hell do we know it wasnt a bug, but intentional vote manipulation happening on <a href="/r/consipracy">/r/consipracy</a>?it simply looks retarded to anyone who doesnt frequent this community and know how not everyone is full on delusional.</p>

<p>now seeing as many users treat this sub as a way to put their dreams/fantasies/nightmare in a journal, i hope its obvious how im pretty skeptic until someone, ANYONE presents any evidence with any bit of validity to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is something I observed.</p>

<p>I noticed some time ago that when I make a reasonable comment on a mainstream sub (but that goes against the narrative), I <em>always</em> get the dagger, and my comment is never downvoted into oblivion. My comment will typically end-up at +1, or +2 ... (<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7mua7m/court_rules_bookkeeper_of_auschwitz_96_must_go_to/drx66w7/">latest example</a>)</p>

<p>So there is always exactly 50% of reasonable people, or the bots/brigade/shills make it so my comment appears ignored/irrelevant (indeed a score of -100 means at least 100 people have read it, which provides some satisfaction too).</p>

<p>Also <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rnvup/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/">see this</a>. It is very important in my opinion to understand the reason for vote manipualation, and most importantly why they had to disable the actual up/down vote count.</p>

<p>Thats vote fuzzing. Every time you refresh the page reddit adds +/- x% of votes at random. Its a trick to make it harder for bot owners to know if their bots votes are ignored or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem pretty active and woke so let me run this theory by you.</p>

<p>Do you know World of Warcraft and how there are too many players to all be online in the same server at once so there were 100+ different servers you could play on, but it was the same maps.</p>

<p>I think something similar is happening in Social Media or on the larger elements of the internet.  Divide and Conquer.</p>

<p>This goes beyond simple shadow banning.  More of a regional or geographic shadowban.  I&#39;m pretty sure the internet is being sectioned off into different smaller groups.   </p>

<p>Especially when it comes to the smaller sites like Reddit.  That&#39;s why us real users never seems to get much traction.</p>

<p>You telling me in the English speaking Western world this is it?  What we see on Reddit Conspiracy.  Probably 60-80% astroturf/shill accounts so that leave what a couple hundred actual real people.  Should be more of us.</p>

<p>Do we have any checks and balances to verify we are not grouped into smaller playpens on the internet?  Twitter employees just admitted on video this is rampantly already in place in their company.</p>

<p>What if there were far more like minded people but we are all being artificially/clandestinely divided.</p>

<p>Just a thought.  If I came up with it then the puppet masters have also and/or already doing it.</p>

<p>Shit man, I never thought of that but I can totally see that being the case. Awhile back there was a thread, I think on r/c_s_t but maybe somewhere else, where someone asked what region people were located. And an unusually high number of responses came from my general region of the northeast USA. There are a lot of reasons this could be the case (high population and lots of colleges and universities around here), but it did strike me as a little odd.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always thought that there were a lot more people awake to the lies, or willing to wake up, than the general reddit experience would indicate. Get someone alone and ask them what they think about 9/11 or chemtrails or whatever and you&#39;re likely to get a way different answer than if you ask them around a group of people. I think people are mostly afraid of ridicule so they just don&#39;t want to &quot;go there.&quot; I think most people are a bit smarter and more open-minded than they are generally given credit for.</p>

<p>I have witnessed this and can confirm it is definitely a problem. </p>

<p>My suspicions are detailed in previous posts. Astroturfing is a huge problem on Reddit (some subs more than others)</p>

<p>I need to create a post, make some suggestions, and get more people involved. Right now I&#39;m so busy with other stuff I don&#39;t really have the time. We all need to be thinking creatively about how to solve this problem; there aren&#39;t enough people working on it. Spam-- it&#39;s not just for emails, it&#39;s also for social networking. (somewhere in the background -- Monty Python: &quot;I don&#39;t like spam!&quot; - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE</a>)</p>

<p>Astroturfing is a different matter. We need developers (Python, Ruby, C++, OpenStack), system implementers, sysadmins (Linux primarily, that would have a familiarity with GRSecurity/PaX), and DB admins (MongoDB, Reddis). I&#39;ll take inclined people who are willing to train themselves and are familiar with Agile Project Management. This project requires the ability to think outside-of-the-box, think holistically and solve problems laterally across an entire infrastructure.  </p>
