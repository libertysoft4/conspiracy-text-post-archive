    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s one of the main avenues for the US deep state to hack elections themselves (eg 2004), so of course TPTB aren&#39;t going to talk about it.  There&#39;s been plenty of discussion of this possibility though outside of government officials and corporate media though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said anything about Russia. Russia didn&#39;t do shit.</p>

<p>Well, I mean, they did. They bribed Obama administration officials and got that Uranium One deal. Then the Clinton campaign decided to attack Trump over alleged connections to Russia to distract from her own corrupt dealings she pulled while Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Russia didn&#39;t hack anything though, nor did they particularly influence the election. I mean, you could say that they ran RT and produced news segments, and people who saw those news segments containing true legitimate news could have been &quot;influenced&quot;... But why shouldn&#39;t RT be allowed to run an international cable news channel? Is it illegal for me to watch RT on YouTube because if I did, that means Russia hacked the election? It&#39;s all just bullshit. </p>

<p>ps I showed that article because it shows significant irregularities in the vote data, there&#39;s no way it&#39;s legitimate. There were more votes in precincts than there even were registered voters. I&#39;m suggesting that it was tampered with electronically, i.e. hacked. It&#39;s also possible the votes were cheated in some other way, but I think electronic editing is the simplest explanation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>We assess with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.</strong> Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self- proclaimed reputation for authenticity.  Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>In early September, Putin said publicly it was important the DNC data was exposed to WikiLeaks, calling the search for the source of the leaks a distraction and denying Russian “state-level” involvement. </p></li>
<li><p>The Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet RT (formerly Russia Today) has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks. RT’s editor-in-chief visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in August 2013, where they discussed renewing his broadcast contract with RT, according to Russian and Western media.  Russian media subsequently announced that RT had become &quot;the only Russian media company&quot; to partner with WikiLeaks and had received access to &quot;new leaks of secret information.&quot;  RT routinely gives Assange sympathetic coverage and provides him a platform to denounce the United States.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange denies this claim. Obama falsified this claim. No substantiation of this claim has has ever been produced. </p>

<p>January 20, 2017: <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/01/20/obama-admits-gap-in-russian-hack-case/">https://consortiumnews.com/2017/01/20/obama-admits-gap-in-russian-hack-case/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hole in the U.S. intelligence community’s “high confidence” about Russia “hacking” Democratic emails has always been who gave the material to WikiLeaks, as President Obama admitted, notes ex-CIA analyst Ray McGovern</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, multiple attempts to discredit WikiLeaks by other means have backfired dramatically on the establishment propaganda organizations involved. Glenn Greenwald&#39;s been writing about that since CNN/CBS/MSNBC printed claims that WaPo falsified then refused to discuss the process by which the false claims made it into print. Here&#39;s Glenn&#39;s latest on the topic: </p>

<p>11 Jan 2018: <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/951479909280571393">https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/951479909280571393</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adam Schiff is one of the most hawkish, pro-militarism, pro-spying members of the Democratic Party. That he has also become their leading voice on Trump/Russia is not a coincidence. Trump/Russia is not just about ethics or scandal: it&#39;s a foreign policy position &amp; ideology:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this from another establishment press outlet:</p>

<p>Dec 15, 2017: <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/while-truth-puts-on-its-shoes/article/2010858">http://www.weeklystandard.com/while-truth-puts-on-its-shoes/article/2010858</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Covering the Trump presidency has not always been the media’s finest hour, but even grading on that curve, the month of December has brought astonishing screwups. Professor and venerable political observer Walter Russell Mead tweeted on December 8, “I remember Watergate pretty well, and I don’t remember anything like this level of journalistic carelessness back then. The constant stream of ‘bombshells’ that turn into duds is doing much more to damage the media than anything Trump could manage.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;ve also gotten this expose of the NYT propaganda process from one of its ex-reporters. </p>

<p>2018-01-03: <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/03/my-life-as-a-new-york-times-reporter-in-the-shadow-of-the-war-on-terror/">https://theintercept.com/2018/01/03/my-life-as-a-new-york-times-reporter-in-the-shadow-of-the-war-on-terror/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was sitting in the nearly empty restaurant of the Westin Hotel in Alexandria, Virginia, getting ready for a showdown with the federal government that I had been trying to avoid for more than seven years. The Obama administration was demanding that I reveal the confidential sources I had relied on for a chapter about a botched CIA operation in my 2006 book, “State of War.” I had also written about the CIA operation for the New York Times, but the paper’s editors had suppressed the story at the government’s request. It wasn’t the only time they had done so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what you&#39;re doing here is spreading an unsubstantiated claim that was disavowed by Obama, pushed by a known propaganda outlet, rejected by the public at large and has provoked an attack by the less corrupt establishment media outlets.</p>

<p>Lastly, his name was Seth Rich and he was a WikiLeaks source.</p>

But at this point with electoral voting it is a pay to win scenario. A lot of money rode on Hilary Clinton. Problem is attention was more valuable than a candidate in prison. With every system so diversely corrupt they all still fell for escapism. &quot;Leaders&quot; my ass. </p>
