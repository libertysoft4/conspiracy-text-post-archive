        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>“Nigger!”  shouts a man dressed in muddied boots, weathered pants, and a stain shirt.  </p>

<p>A black man sitting at the bus stop rises up.</p>

<p>With a calm demeanor he begins to speak. </p>

<p>“Let your heart be at peace, I see no nigger here.
No sir there is no nigger here indeed. Nor do you see a proud black man before you. What you see is but a man. The foundation of my strength does not come from the color of my skin. So I wont be so easily provoked. Because if I were to build myself up on the basis of my skin color that would cause for a weak foundation. One so easily controlled. One that gives way to emotion. But i’ve built myself up knowing that I am a man. More so than that I am human. This you can’t take way from me. No. But I have fought for your right to call me a nigger and I’d do so again. For if it gives you reprieve to  express that vitriol then please do so. Because I am no nigger and can never be one. That word has no power over me. I’ve never thought for a second I could be a nigger. Never knew a man who thought himself one either.”</p>

<p>The man who shouted nigger. Has paused but for a moment,  he moves his mouth to speak. </p>

<p>But the black  man continues.</p>

<p>“You see, all those that build themselves up on the basis of skin, white, black or brown are weak individuals. They can be controlled and pressed. Push to react a certain way. Because they have to protect the foundation that they’ve built up. They will be hard pressed to recognize that you can’t really build on top of that foundation, because you’ve got to constantly defend it.”</p>

<p>“My parents told me I should be proud to be black, they too didn’t understand that my sense of pride came from within. Not because I was born with this skin. I was shunned from other black kids that thought I acted too white .I never knew what that meant. SO I told them I am who I am, what you see is skin. You don’t see me for who I really am.” </p>

<p>He takes his seat at the bus stop.</p>

<p>The man who shouted nigger begins to walk again. His eyes bloodshot, and the smell of liquor off his breath. He with teary eye’s says “Niggger” , he falls to his knees.</p>

<p>(What you don’t know about the man shouting nigger is his wife was beaten and raped by 4 black men. For some gang initiation. His wife didn’t survive. So the hate in his heart grew. But the man before him was no nigger this he knew. ) </p>

<p>He begins to weep. </p>

<p>The man who spoke from the bus stop rises once more. He offers his hand to the man weeping. He brings him up to the bus stop bench. Embraces the man with a strong arm around his shoulder. Allows the man to cry. There they sit in silence, with the balling of a drunken man. He never knew the back story of the man who exclaimed nigger. But he didn’t need it.</p>

<p>He saw a hurt individual who only knew how to express his pain through words. Was it wrong to express that pain? No.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I wrote this because I think there is conspiracy to not only divide us but for us to some how be afraid of words. To allow words to have power over us. The topic at hand isn&#39;t something that should be censored.</p>

<p>Freedom of expression in all of its glory should be embraced. Aye if you got hate in your heart then out with it. If you must call me names to rid yourself of that hate then so be it.</p>

But before any of that I am human first. Whatever that means.  I think race and identifying with it and building yourself up on that basis is something that is very detrimental to society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A halmark feature of the modern domesticated man is the delegation of personal authority to others.  Instead of working out a neighbor dispute, they call the police.  If someone is too noisy in a theatre instead of asking the person to please quiet down they call staff.  Revolving doors stop, and they wait instead of just pushing the door.  Something needs fixing on the car or around the house, they call the repair man instead of trying to do it themselves.</p>

<p>I have an inalienable right to self expression.  I do not advocate or call for violence (outside of self-defence or defence of family from an imminent threat).  Therefore, no entity has any authority to tell me what words I can and cannot use.  But, there are idiots who haven&#39;t the ability to build a context-appropriate vocabulary- that is a different topic</p>

I will hear that word perhaps hundreds of times before I leave.  If I let one slip, all hell might break loose.  To me, it is about respect primarily with context also being important.

Respect should go both ways, but in this case it often doesn&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>Your own ideology makes that word have bad connotations. DO you see black people or just people. I wonder. DO you like that one group can say a word but another can&#39;t? Isn&#39;t that odd. One word has so much power. But it is taboo. A word. Think about that. If I say nigger and elicits no response guess what happens to the power of that word. It becomes null. If everyone is okay to say nigger then guess what nigger becomes nothing but a word. If I put no emotional power in the word it holds no sway over me. It holds no sway over anyone. </p>

<p>But if you react to the word, it shows me that you allow that word to have power over you. I could predict how you react if I were to push further.  I could make you a menacing fool if one single word pushes you one the edge. </p>

<p>This is what we can no longer allow to happen, it is what is causing further divide. I want people to find strength not in the color of their skin, but from within. I don&#39;t want proud black men walking around or proud white men walking around and the only reason they are proud is because they were born black or white. </p>

<p>What kind of pride is that. They can find nothing else in themselves to be prideful for. So they have to use their own skin color to give them self worth. It is laughable. It is appalling. It is sad. It is maddening. I will not go along with the agenda. Not any more. </p>

<p>Such is the time to speak out and speak loud. Renounce the propaganda. Let Freedom ring. Let MLK&#39;s dream ring true. Tolerate those with hate. Rise above it. For those filled with hate watch as it has no affect on you. Then you can flip the switch and watch them become the menacing fools.</p>

<p>The black community reappropriated it but then the sjw movement got ahold of it and used it like a fascist tool to co-opt people to their way of thinking or else face potentially violent life changing reprisals,over using a fucking word. The backlash was so huge the country elected Trump despite the fact Bannon was attached to him.</p>

<p>When I was coming up if a white kid called a black kid that word there might have been a fist fight. Now it holds so much weight that just using that word carries the risk of destroying both peoples lives even if a black kid calls another black kid that on a fucking school playground or let&#39;s it slip while a little drunk at a party for Christ&#39;s sake.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s not hate speech then what&#39;s the fucking real problem? If it is hate speech lets hear it and let someone&#39;s own words shine a light on themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You had this story, but then failed miserably with your explanation. People who go around saying shit don&#39;t suddenly become less hateful-it doesn&#39;t make them &quot;get the racism out.&quot; Free speech is great, but being a shithead is still being a shithead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh but it does keep the racism out in the open not hidden from society. Do you think that if we ban a word and bar its use that it removes hate? Or does it hid that hate from society. Are we to pretend it doesn&#39;t exist?  </p>

<p>You misunderstand, I say let them spew the hate for all to hear. We can combat the ideology of hate. With the ideology of love and compassion. With our words we can battle the hate filled. </p>

<p>Free speech is great, and the price of free speech is hearing things we don&#39;t want to hear. Shit heads will still be shit heads.</p>
