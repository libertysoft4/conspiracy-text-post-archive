It doesn&#39;t matter whether you believe 911 was an inside job, sandy hook was a hoax, vaccines are bad, or the fluoride in the water is killing us all. What matters is that our first step should be to stand together as a collective group and say enough is enough! No single person no matter how powerful can drain the swamp, it is only us, we the people, who can drain the swamp. Until we can all stand together and put our differences aside for just a moment, they will have total control and it is only us to blame, not George Soros, not Donald Trump, and not Hillary Clinton.

    <div class="md"><p>at one time in the US, most people lived in concentrated urban areas, and very few lived in rural areas (those who live in rural areas worked the land and stayed there)</p>

<p>then the introduction of cars made it possible and convenient for more people to move away from cities and into &quot;suburbs&quot;, some of which have no public transportation or walkable resources, even though such areas are unsustainable</p>

<p>but no one is forced to live far from resources when high-density areas still exist (though some have distaste for them), and while cars are nice to have, very few people are forced to have them. also, in the past people walked more and further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me spell it out for you.</p>

<p>&quot;80.7% of americans live in urban areas, and most urban areas have public transportation. hardly a niche situation&quot;</p>

<p>Urban is simply a descriptor same as rural. The easiest way to quantitatively classify an area as urban or not is based on population density (or household density). This is a spectrum from high-density to low-density, where we usually think of high-density as urban, low-density as rural, and the middle of the spectrum as suburban. </p>

<p>Here, Alex is saying if you fall within 80.7% of the population you really don&#39;t NEED a car because of available public transit systems. If you fall outside of this %, living outside of urban areas it was their CHOICE to do so, with the exception of very poor people who might have been pushed out of the urban city centers. This is the population we should be concerned about, but that&#39;s another issue. If you have chosen to live outside the urban center and live in suburban areas, you have lower rents thus making a car more affordable than someone who might live in the urban center. But this does NOT mean that public transportation is not available even if you live outside of the urban/city center and you live instead in the more suburban areas of the city or even in the rural areas of the city.</p>

<p>Where there is higher population, you get better, more consistent and more frequent public transit options making it less necessary sometimes even a hassle to own a car. For example, 56% of New York City&#39;s households don&#39;t own a car. Did you know in some areas of New York people BUY parking spaces like they do a home? It&#39;s because of the density of the city. 26% of households in Detroit, a very large and completely desecrated city with urban planning that was built on the concept of cars with large city blocks, do not own cars. </p>

<p>In conclusion, having a car is a luxury, meaning it&#39;s convenience oriented. If you live in an area with little to no public transit, you&#39;re more than likely living in a more rural area which means living costs will be significantly lower, and your opportunity cost for owning a car might outweigh not owning a car and it might be beneficial to invest in a car. </p>

<p>&quot;No it wasn&#39;t. Alex&#39;s agrument was urban. By his logic I live in a urban area and his logic doesn&#39;t apply&quot;</p>

<p>To explain again, even if you live outside of the urban city center, there are still public transit options. Sure someone might have to walk longer, wait for the bus longer, etc. but again I&#39;ll reiterate, owning a car has a convenience factor.</p>

<p>&quot;Now research why the system is the way it is and how it plays into the large system.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;system&quot; is the way it is, because that&#39;s what it has come to be. It&#39;s a work in progress, it&#39;s not as if some nefarious 1% decided this is how we should live. Cultural, social, technological, medicinal  advances have changed and shaped our recent history to what it is. Sure, I can believe there&#39;s powers at play that have slowed our advancement, but there hasn&#39;t been a better system for this size of population. If you can outline something better, I think we&#39;re ALL ears.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell more about how the city isn&#39;t &quot;urban&quot; thus not applying to his logic. Also please explain to me the difference between city transportation and urban&quot;</p>

<p>Cities are a gradation of urban to suburban to rural. Some are purely rural, some purely urban or any combination of all. His comment says &quot;urban areas.&quot; He&#39;s not saying urban isn&#39;t a city and that logic is just stupid, because you&#39;re using the words wrong.</p>

<p>You have no understanding of the situation.</p>

<p>I never once denied that public transportation existed. You thinking that solves anything especially when you used New York as an example. Legit you go from decent public transportation to non existent. So the need for a car grows the further you get away. This isn&#39;t that hard. You sound shelter or a &quot;tough guy&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look you ignorant twat, I grew up using public transit going to and from school because both my parents worked 6-5 every weekday and most times weekends, to make a better life for our family. They worked hard to INVEST in a vehicle so they can shuttle themselves to and from work and would take less than than taking public transit. Again, they had to INVEST for CONVENIENCE. This convenience allowed them to have more time to go to work, spend with me, etc. It was not a requirement. </p>

<p>Life is tough, the goal is to work hard and gain GENERATIONAL WEALTH so you children or grand children don&#39;t have to spend/waste time going in public transit, if it&#39;s a burden. Some people start out poor, that&#39;s fine, so you gotta bite your lip and work your ass off so your kids have opportunities you never did.</p>

<p>Here, Alex is saying if you fall within 80.7% of the population you really don&#39;t NEED a car because of available public transit systems. If you fall outside of this %, living outside of urban areas it was their CHOICE to do so, with the exception of very poor people who might have been pushed out of the urban city centers. This is the population we should be concerned about, but that&#39;s another issue. If you have chosen to live outside the urban center and live in suburban areas, you have lower rents thus making a car more affordable than someone who might live in the urban center. But this does NOT mean that public transportation is not available even if you live outside of the urban/city center and you live instead in the more suburban areas of the city or even in the rural areas of the city.</p>

<p>Where there is higher population, you get better, more consistent and more frequent public transit options making it less necessary sometimes even a hassle to own a car. For example, 56% of New York City&#39;s households don&#39;t own a car. Did you know in some areas of New York people BUY parking spaces like they do a home? It&#39;s because of the density of the city. 26% of households in Detroit, a very large and completely desecrated city with urban planning that was built on the concept of cars with large city blocks, do not own cars. </p>

<p>In conclusion, having a car is a luxury, meaning it&#39;s convenience oriented. If you live in an area with little to no public transit, you&#39;re more than likely living in a more rural area which means living costs will be significantly lower, and your opportunity cost for owning a car might outweigh not owning a car and it might be beneficial to invest in a car. </p>

<p>&quot;No it wasn&#39;t. Alex&#39;s agrument was urban. By his logic I live in a urban area and his logic doesn&#39;t apply&quot;</p>

<p>To explain again, even if you live outside of the urban city center, there are still public transit options. Sure someone might have to walk longer, wait for the bus longer, etc. but again I&#39;ll reiterate, owning a car has a convenience factor.</p>

<p>&quot;Now research why the system is the way it is and how it plays into the large system.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;system&quot; is the way it is, because that&#39;s what it has come to be. It&#39;s a work in progress, it&#39;s not as if some nefarious 1% decided this is how we should live. Cultural, social, technological, medicinal  advances have changed and shaped our recent history to what it is. Sure, I can believe there&#39;s powers at play that have slowed our advancement, but there hasn&#39;t been a better system for this size of population. If you can outline something better, I think we&#39;re ALL ears.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell more about how the city isn&#39;t &quot;urban&quot; thus not applying to his logic. Also please explain to me the difference between city transportation and urban&quot;</p>

<p>Cities are a gradation of urban to suburban to rural. Some are purely rural, some purely urban or any combination of all. His comment says &quot;urban areas.&quot; He&#39;s not saying urban isn&#39;t a city and that logic is just stupid, because you&#39;re using the words wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we make every road a toll road and implement some sort of ez pass system that charges the vehicle everytime they drive on a road? Do we care about a uniform standard of maintenance for the roads? Does it cost the same to drive down each road or can the prices be set via other factors? If road a has 500 vehicles drive on it a day and generates x amount of revenue and road b only gets a 150 vehicles driving on it a day generating less revenue, do the vehicles who need road b pay more for the access to the road in order to maintain it since there are less vehicles using the road or does the quality of maintenance on road b suffer in comparison to road a because of the limited funds its use bring in? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like how private colleges are more affordable than public. </p>

<p>Or how the private library system is better than the public library system </p>

<p>Or how FedEx is cheaper than the Post Office. </p>

<p>And how UPS sends all your letters for cheaper than the Post Office sends mail. </p>

<p>Or how much better private roads are than the public highways. </p>

<p>Please. Not everything is better to just be done by a private company. Companies and corporations are by definition, only looking for a profit. They are looking to serve you, at best, second to turning a profit. In some cases that&#39;s fine, restaurants, for instance, fight for your approval and money. So we get some great service there. </p>

<p>But libraries... there&#39;s NO MONEY in loaning anyone and everyone free books and other media. None. No money. No way to make that profitable. So we all pay a few bucks in taxes that go to libraries, and that keeps them funded, stocked, and staffed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that, just like now, that people &#39;terrible at driving&#39; should pay a higher premium.  However, if I have a clean record with no history of accidents or violations, I would hope that my premium will not be raised just because I choose to drive my own vehicle in an era of driverless cars.

That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying...they will use driverless cars to charge those who want to maintain control higher premiums, regardless of driving record.</p>

<p>All of technology renders less and less control and responsibility over ourselves and our lives as human beings.  If you don&#39;t see the viable concern with this premise, then I implore you to think a bit more critically about the trade-offs between state-mandated &quot;security&quot; and individual self-reliance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a few holes in this to list. I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, but you&#39;re only looking at this from one side. I&#39;ll name two for example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Drivers license shows you comprehend at least basic driver/road laws for driving. I&#39;d much rather drive with people that know than people that might not know. You can&#39;t trust everyone to do their own <em>independent</em> research on driving laws. </p></li>
<li><p>Road taxes are unavoidable. Unfortunately, nothing in the world is free. So, road taxes are way to pay for the roads. If we didn&#39;t pay them, our roads would be riddled with potholes or they would be non-existent. Or suppose we didn&#39;t have to pay them, and the money came from somewhere else. There would be another (or multiple) government-provided services that would have their funding slashed or dropped.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Taxes aren&#39;t meant to be bad. It&#39;s meant to raise revenue for the country, so we can all have a decent life. We don&#39;t experience that here because the US has it&#39;s priorities completely out of order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. It could apply to other things that government claim is for your &quot;safety.&quot; I guess I&#39;m most comfortable with relinquishing that freedom because I view driving a car as life and death. You&#39;re taking your life into your own hands and other lives, too. One mistake could be very fatal, so I will begrudgingly get a license and be thankful others have them, too. </p>

<p>Although, I do have to say, it&#39;s bs how you can get a $150 ticket, in the state of SC, for not updating your address information on your license. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the license proves we have basic road comprehension why do we have to pay for this license year after year. Why not take the test…pay for the license and be done with it?</p>

<p>There is nothing about the drivers test…written or driven that proves anyone is competent to be on the road in all the various conditions and situations that can arise…nothing.</p>

<p>You can get a license at 16 and never be retested again UNLESS you prove (through tickets/accidents) you are inept. Why couldn&#39;t the same measuring stick be applied right from the beginning?</p>

<p>A driver&#39;s license is mainly a method of control. Nothing more. I can be charged with a &quot;crime&quot; for simply not having my license on me when I&#39;m driving. Why? Does it contain some magical properties that improve my driving?</p>

<p>As far as road taxes…how about auto manufacturers having to pay the lion&#39;s share of them. Or Amazon who wouldn&#39;t be able to make billions delivering their products without them? They benefit more than most by our road system. Neither of them would have a business were it not for OUR roads.</p>

<p>Citizens pay for the infrastructure and corporations benefit. Externalization, it&#39;s called.</p>

<p>Finally taxes don&#39;t raise revenue. Taxes pay interest on the debts we owe to private banks from whom we borrow the money, at interest, to pay for our infrastructure.</p>
