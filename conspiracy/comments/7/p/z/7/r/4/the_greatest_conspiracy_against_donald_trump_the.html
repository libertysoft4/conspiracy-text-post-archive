<p>Wrong. He said “Their Rapists”. </p>

<p>Not ‘They’re’. </p>

<p>What are They Bringing?: crime, drugs, rapists</p>

<p>Three things they are bringing. </p>

<p>Not saying they ARE crime. </p>

<p>Not saying they ARE drugs. </p>

<p>Not saying they ARE rapists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tbf, OP is right. As a non-Trump supporter, it&#39;s one of the things I remember having to constantly check friends on. Their main knock on him from the outset was racism and their main proof was this exact quote that was always taken out of context. </p>

<p>There are many things to knock Trump on, and it&#39;s possible he is a racist (my grandfather is his age and is a staunch Democrat but says racist things every time we go to lunch - if for no other reason, Trump likely harbors racist tendencies out of age alone), but to use this quote as proof is a really tired tactic. </p>

<p>The guy was describing the characteristics of illegal Mexican immigrants. He wasn&#39;t wrong that many are criminals and that their crimes vary in details. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. He never mentions illegal immigrants in his quote or in the entire speech.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When do we beat Mexico at the border? They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they’re killing us economically.</p>

<p>The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.</p>

<p>Thank you. It’s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what the fuck you mean, man. Jesus. It&#39;s just not an appropriate analogy. </p>

<p>You already quoted the guy. He mentions the border and then he mentions the people who cross it. You want to believe he&#39;s speaking about legal immigrants when the truth is he speaks about <em>illegal</em> immigration ad nauseam. </p>

<p>And before you suggest it, I don&#39;t agree with his viewpoint but you&#39;re making asinine analogies just to justify your belief that this particular quote is racist when it&#39;s nothing but a poorly worded stance on illegal immigration that justifies (in his mind) the need for his wall. </p>
