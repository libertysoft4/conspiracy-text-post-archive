    <div class="md"><p>What if the entire election was a staged event, using Hegelian dialectic and other forms of manipulation in order to divide the American people strongly against each other, as well as racially divide the country through a corrupt and divisive media. What if it was all planned this way from the start, and both Trump and Hillary were not real enemies, but merely playing a role. And, what if Trump is not who he claims to be, and was really manipulating the people into voting for him by telling them the things they thought they wanted to hear, thus setting up a future cognitive dissonance of accepting anything he does, whether it is beneficial or harmful. </p>

<p>Why has Trump surrounded himself with people who do not have the best interest of the American people in mind? Why did he attack Syria over a most definite staged attack. Why is he leading people into fear through the use of North Korea, which I believe is nothing more than a propaganda tool to frighten the American people to give up more of their rights in the name of security. Is Trump&#39;s inevitable impeachment merely a stage show to tear the nation apart, ultimately causing riots and a revolution style revolt, in order for a New Age to rise from the ashes? Does Trump know his fate, and is he simply playing his role? </p>

<p>It appears the media has played an incredibly large role in the brainwashing of the American people from the very start, as that is their main job. But, is it possible that Trump also played along with the media, and is using the term &#39;fake news&#39; in order for the media to claim itself as real news, therefore allowing the media to blur the line between what is real news, and what isn&#39;t—and, make it harder for the majority of people to distinguish between what is real, and what isn&#39;t—ultimately leading to mass confusion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DNC gave trump the spotlight with their controlled media for an easy Victory. </p>

<p>At the the same time Bernie was kicking Hillary&#39;s ass, but the DNC wanted Hillary so they cheated Bernie. He said he was cheated. Wikileaks said He was cheated. His large support base saw he was cheated. For those who continued to read wikileaks Hillary was convincingly curroupt.</p>

<p>That mixed with resentment of Bernie Sanders getting cheated she lost democratic votes. And I imagine trump telling both sides to go fucked themselves was refreshing to majority of Americans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A more possible theory: &#39;The Democratic party rigged the elections. They took Bernie out of the equation, since he was more likely to win against Trump and instead, they pushed for Hillary. They knew she was going to loose and Trump would be elected. This way, they get to throw ALL of the blame of Republicans-Right Wing, almost destroy the country under his Presidency, and then they can come back in 2020 and take over. And I mean, TAKE OVER. The people would be fed up and angry at Trump and the right, so they&#39;d have blind faith in the Left and Democrats, and they&#39;d blindly follow their every move/decision. It&#39;s already happening, so imagine how much trust the average American would have on the Democratic party after this administration almost destroys the country&#39;. </p>
