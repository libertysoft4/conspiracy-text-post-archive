    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it was definitely blown out of proportion. But it really, <em>really</em> sucked if you were unlucky enough to get it. No vomit...just an incredibly high fever (mine peaked at 105.7 if I recall correctly). Aches and pains, migraines, chills, hot sweats. My whole family got it and all of us were bedridden for a week, really showed me the importance of the family unit- we were all terribly sick but we <em>had</em> to take care of each other. No one else could. Fucking miserable, and the worst I&#39;ve ever felt in my life. But even then, it was blown way out of proportion as far as fear of getting it. </p>

<p>I got hit with this years bad flu and I was knocked on my ass for 12 days. I’m young and healthy, so it would be scary for older folks. </p>

<p>I don’t love fear mongering, I’m sure no one in this sub does, but the amount of adults who don’t follow basic hygiene practices is alarming! maybe the fear mongering is s good reminder for people to cover their mouths, stay home if sick, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got it as well. It was probably the second worst flu I remember. In 2011, I got a flu that gave me a fever for 8 straight days, peaking at like 103.5. I&#39;ve never had a fever that long, before or since.</p>

<p>H3N2 was the main strain in 2011-2012. Considered to be generally more severe than H1N1 and influenza B. It&#39;s also the predominant strain this year. Maybe that&#39;s why that 21 year old died.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why go to a doctor for the flu?  There is nothing they can do that you can&#39;t do at home unless you are so sick you need to be hospitalized.  Antibiotics do not help with the flu, pharmacies are out of Tamaflu. So many people simply can&#39;t afford hospitalization.  Some people are sick for weeks.  People lose their jobs when they take two weeks sick leave.

    <div class="md"><p>The flu can be deadly. That’s why you seek medical attention.</p>

<p>Now I’m not saying if you just have a low grade fever and the sniffles, we are talking about the full blown flu, where you have crud in your lungs that just won’t come up.</p>

<p>Relentless coughing, dehydration, high fever and chills...this stuff kills people.</p>

<p>Read up on the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu. Vitamin C, D, heroine, almond milk and a gluten free diet will only protect you from so much.</p>

<p>Although I’m only kind of mocking you, a healthy immune system can only do so much. Once these flu bugs hit the lungs and turn into pneumonia, “you’re gonna have a bad day.”</p>

<p>No amount of Sunny D is gonna fix that.</p>

AND MANY PEOPLE AVOID DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS BECAUSE THEY CANT AFFORD IT AND THEY CONTINUE TO GO TO WORK BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF LOING THEIR JOBS.  DUH...If your symptoms are bad enough, you should go to the Dr.or hospital and worry about the bill later.  Duh...
I happen to be familiar with the flu epidemic of 1918-1919.<br/>
My daughter has a compromised immune system and often ends getting pneumonia from the common flu and ends up in ER.<br/>
My son almost died from the swine flu.  He had to get medical care.
I do not have insurance.  If I thought my life was in danger, I would suck it up and go the hospital.  But in order to boost my immune system, I avoid antibiotics unless absolutely necessary and I take my stupid SUNNY D.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>COME ON!!! People, the flu is a virus. Antibiotics are for bacteria and do not work on viruses.  They are 2 different things.  And YES the virus does have the potential to  get worse every year.  As in it evolves and continues to try to spread itself.  So we have to continue modifying the vaccines. It&#39;s a never ending cycle really.  There are viruses that have been around for hundreds of thousands of years.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, I should have remembered that, I&#39;ve worked in a medical clinic. We&#39;ll call that a brain fart of trying to use the term generically, like calling all soda Coke- but worse. I was sick and tired, and passing out. People still need to take all of their medication though- for the same reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been in the news for months now people.  This year&#39;s vaccine is only 10% effective.  If you don&#39;t know what that means, you may not be properly informed on how the flu mutates every year or how we are always playimg catch up with a new vaccine.  So please, go learn about it.  Google.  Wikipedia.  Don&#39;t jump to conclusions and work yourself up in a frenzied, uninformed circle jerk.  </p>

Either you&#39;re a hermit, it&#39;s your 1st year on Earth, or your trying to make a conspiracy out of a known and expected medical issue.  You&#39;re trying to populate a sub about conspiracy theories by writing about something so not a conspiracy, and so mindlessness that only the most uninformed people latch on and agree with you.  &quot;UUUH HUUUR I DUN HERD THE FLU IS MAKIN THE WEATHER COLD TOO!&quot; Stop creating bullshit.

Lots of people I know couldn&#39;t eat a Christmas dinner so sad&lt;/3 but now seeing lots of posts about it across the world, it does seem we all got hit by it pretty hard. </p>

<p>The weather has also been crazy: -20  and then +11, on and off.</p>

<p>Read an article yesterday that mentioned how bad it is in Australia too, and that the flu shot has only ended up being 10% effective (but they&#39;re still pushing it!!). </p>
