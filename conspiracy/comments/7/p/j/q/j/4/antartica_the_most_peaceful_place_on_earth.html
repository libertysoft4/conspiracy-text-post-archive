        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Helo again,</p>

<p>So I have taken on the chin some comments left in my previous threads that I should compartmentalize some of the sections and expand on some points.. and hopefully generate some discussion, so where better to start than Antarctica?</p>

<p>I will be entirely honest in that I don’t even know where to start in regards to Antarctica, it has a mystifying and untouchable aura about it.. knowing that I will likely never physically visit there.. but I will lay out as much information as I feel is worth sharing. Some you will have seen before if you have combed through my posts, but I’ve added some new content here for your perusal.</p>

<p>As far as our current human memory goes, Antarctica is a “recent,” discovery. Many sailors, including James Cook tried searching for this supposedly massive southern landmass in vain. He eventually gave up, citing that there likely was a landmass below where he had sailed, but that is was of no importance. What did happen from his travels was a hivemind of opportunist hunters taking note of him seeing whales and seals.. and heading South to hunt. What ensued over the next few hundred years were tidbits of land being found here and there, always hinting that there was something much larger once you actually landed and explored, though this was not an easy task (obviously). Cue the explorers, the British Antarctic Expedition and every other country worth it’s salt in the late 1800s scrambling around this massive unknown continent to lay claim to it and explore the last real unexplored place on Earth. </p>

<p>Antarctica has nearly 90% of the ice and 70% of the fresh water on Earth, it was dictated in the Antarctic Treaty to be “in the interest of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purpose.” <a href="http://www.gc.noaa.gov/documents/1959-Antarctic-treaty.pdf">http://www.gc.noaa.gov/documents/1959-Antarctic-treaty.pdf</a></p>

<p>I recommend reading the treaty, it’s not long and a pretty interesting read in terms of the “vision,” that the countries had for Antarctica.. mainly to be used as a giant science playground and I think the treaty was put in place to prevent an aggressive resource grab</p>

<p>Let’s use this treaty as the midway point between Robert Falcon Scott traipsing around a then unknown continent, to Lockheed Martin being the lead logistics contractor.. a key component of the Military Industrial Complex. What has happened in this relatively short time frame? Is this treaty a sham?</p>

<p>Well..</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XHbrOg092GA?t=1038">https://youtu.be/XHbrOg092GA?t=1038</a> [1:07:37]</p>

<p>If you watch Kevin Shipp (Ex-CIA) state that Leidos Holdings is a key component of the Intelligence Industrial Complex, albeit not technically part of the &quot;military,&quot; it contracts many secret projects and is the current logistical contract manager in Antarctica.. interesting...&quot;to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes.&quot;</p>

<p>Who are &quot;Leidos,&quot;?</p>

<p>(See below research from <a href="/u/52NUKE">/u/52NUKE</a>)</p>

<p>&quot;more than doubling the size of Leidos and its portfolio, and positioning the company as the global defense industry&#39;s largest enterprise in the federal technical solutions sector&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In August 2012, SAIC announced its plans to split into two publicly traded companies&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The split has allowed both companies to pursue more business, which it could not pursue as a single company due to conflicts of interest&quot;</p>

<p>Current Subsidiaries -</p>

<p>Reveal, develops dual-energy X-ray computed tomography systems for explosives-detection at airports and similar facilities CloudShield Technologies a wholly owned subsidiary, specializing in cyber-security Former subsidiaries - Network Solutions was acquired by SAIC in 1995, and subsequently was acquired by VeriSign, Inc. for $21 billion. Customs and Border Control contracts SAIC is among the 8 top contributors to federal candidates FBI allegations In June 2001 the FBI paid SAIC $122 million to create a Virtual Case File (VCF) software system to speed up the sharing of information among agents. But the FBI abandoned VCF when it failed to function adequately.</p>

<p>Military involvement, or at least involvement that is documented to a degree reached a peak during WWII, specifically...after the war was supposedly over.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bahaistudies.net/asma/Operation_Highjump.pdf">http://www.bahaistudies.net/asma/Operation_Highjump.pdf</a></p>

<p>Most of you have probably read this, or at least heard about it. It was a massive military operation which ended as a failure.. with quite conflicting information to read about and it 100% has an &quot;official narrative.&quot; But i&#39;m not interested in that..</p>

<p>Watch this if you haven&#39;t, rare Richard E Byrd footage discussing Antarctica - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mdkhc1gdPr4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mdkhc1gdPr4</a></p>

<p>I value interviews with people who have &quot;lived it,&quot; and take heed to what, and how they say things. I believe Mr.Byrd is being sincere in his talk of &quot;land beyond the South Pole, larger than North America.&quot; This is one of the ultimate truths, what lies beyond the South Pole.. what land is he referencing here? What is &quot;beyond&quot; the South Pole..? A compelling case for a hollow earth scenario, or at least additional areas of Earth we are not aware of existing.</p>

<p>Why did they have Cryptographic Aides with them? hmm..</p>

<p>This interview appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 1947 edition of the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, and read in part as follows:</p>

<p>‘“Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The Admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking – recalled the Admiral – is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety.”</p>

<p>The year is 1947. What planes that are hostile.. would be from polar regions? How could they fly over &quot;one, or both poles.&quot; I have read that transcript many a time, and his behaviour in the video and the comments to El Mercurio are extremely interesting. </p>

<p>So.. how far is pole to pole in our current Earth Model? 12,430 miles. Max range of any WWII-era plane that we know of would barely be over 1,000 miles.</p>

<p>What cohesive force in 1947 had access to both poles? with hostile planes that sent a massive operation PACKING.. (they finished the expedition early and incurred losses)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtlsV4nDz5g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtlsV4nDz5g</a> It is a well documented fact that the Nazis were already poking around in Antarctica as early as 1939 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Swabia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Swabia</a>. What were they doing?</p>

<p>There is footage on this website that was once on Vimeo, but has been removed - </p>

<p>Reading the description of what they entail is interesting, such as the mention of large underground caves being used, and complex equipment like a Tesla Coil.. proof that the Nazi&#39;s were not fucking around.</p>

<p>&quot;Maria Orschitsch, a member of the Vril-Gesellschaft would obtained telepathically messages from extraterrestrials in a code language of the Knights Templar, a language that was unknown to her. &quot;</p>

<p>What a description.. quite an interesting read. So what does this all mean? There is undoubtedly alot of activity in Antarctica up until this point, with a focus on secrecy and pretty limited information for us to work with. </p>

<p>Is this real? </p>

<p>&quot;Space-Mapping Mission of Antarctica Aborted - Overruled by The NSA Contact: Rosemary Sullivant Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA Phone 818/354-0747 </p>

<p>RELEASE: 01-24-01</p>

<p>In a brief announcement today, NASA and the JPL terminated all further study of Lake Vostok in S. Antarctica. In an apparent slip of confidentiality, spokeswoman Debra Shingteller alluded to &quot;National Security Issues&quot; allowing the NSA to assume full control of what had been an International effort to explore a huge, under-ice lake near the Russian Vostok research station.</p>

<p>Ms. Shingteller was immediately led away from the podium, and an aid responded to the many further questions with the same answer: &quot;the project has been halted due to environmental issues&quot;, and that no further releases were pending. The large crowd of press corp. were left clamoring as the officials left the stage. Ms. Shingteller has not responded to repeated attempts at contact. </p>

<p>The above is a report from an official JPL PR representative who attended the announcement. </p>

<p>The following is part of a letter written to an editor of Scientific American Magazine (who has requested anonymity).</p>

<p>The linked photo at the end was released by NASA in Jan 2001 seemingly by mistake. It is no longer available from the official archive...&quot;</p>

<p>Lake Vostok information -</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thelivingmoon.com/47brotherthebig/03files/Space_Mapping_Lake_Vostok_Overridden_by_NSA.html">http://www.thelivingmoon.com/47brotherthebig/03files/Space_Mapping_Lake_Vostok_Overridden_by_NSA.html</a></p>

<p>There are many who would surpose that a &quot;Fourth Reich,&quot; existed in secrecy and has corralled and subverted it&#39;s way via Operation Paperclip and it&#39;s manifestions into a very key component of the Military Intelligence Industrial Complex, a huge arm of the NSA, which is fiddling around in Antarctica. Would you believe they were adhering the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 of &quot;peaceful purposes only,&quot; I think not!</p>

<p>This quote is brought up very often, but what if Admiral Byrd&#39;s intention was more directed at pointing out for example the possibility of Soviet airplanes/rockets coming into U.S. airspace from across the North Pole ?</p>

<p>Yes, that still leaves the South Pole, but what if he was thinking more along the lines of an Fractional Orbital Bombardment System type of weapon on a polar orbit as a possible threat to the U.S. ?</p>

I know their claimed territory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Swabia">Neuschwabenland</a> was no longer Germany&#39;s on paper as of 1945, but they had built underground bunkers long before the war ended and I highly highly doubt they werent using them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Admiral Byrd story is so incredibly spooky. I believe it&#39;s waaay too out there for anyone to be able to really take it at face value, and yet there it is. One cannot really debate it&#39;s existence. Perhaps it&#39;s an elaborate psyop, the whole story that is? But for what purpose?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some theories. </p>

<p>The Earth&#39;s climate shifts slowly over time, getting hotter or colder over millions of years. There have been many ice ages as well as fire ages. What we call the ice age is actually still going on we&#39;re just at the tail end of it, the planet&#39;s climate getting slowly hotter since then, moving towards an eventual age of fire. </p>

<p>Life always survives and evolves. Through some kind of base spiritual connection with the Earth, or through slow knowledge gathered over ages of civilizations, we&#39;ve come to know, on a subconscious level, that this is how things will go. Many people have had visions of a fiery end to our world, and this is them tapping into a deeper part of their unconscious mind to uncover a universal truth they had never fully acknowledged consciously. </p>

<p>Whatever the cause, all these myths of a fiery doom for the Earth are based at some level in reality. The same could be true of the flood myths, maybe there are water ages as well, where the shifting climate causes all land to be submerged for millions of years. </p>

<p>Because the ice age hasn&#39;t fully ended, there are still parts of Earth covered in ice. Antartica is the biggest one. One of the great truths that the catholic church and other powerful organizations want to hide is that ruins of an incredibly ancient human civilization lie frozen under the ice of Antarctica. These ruins will prove that human civilizations advanced enough to understand masonry and writing have existed for hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years. The 6,000 years or so of recorded human history that we have now are just what we have records of. But other records, including knowledge of much more ancient civilizations, has been destroyed or lost. Maybe there are also known records that are being kept hidden by the church as well. Climate catastrophes, one civilizations destroying all trace of another and building over it, there are ways all record of a people could be lost. </p>

<p>There is also a strong possibility that one or more massive underground cave systems exist in Antarctica. We know there is a cave system in China that&#39;s big enough to have it&#39;s own weather. I believe an ecosystem like this, but much larger, exists under the ice, and that we discovered how to access these cave systems a long time ago. There also seem to be warm water springs under the ice. So why is the existence of this place kept secret, why are we told it&#39;s nothing but a frozen waste land?</p>

<p>I think it has to do with the idea of a break away society. In short, the elite need a place to go where they know they can be safe and well provided for, no matter what happens to the planet. All rulers have always arranged safe places like this in case of emergency. When the climate on the surface becomes too hot to survive, this is where they will retreat to.</p>

<p>But if that were to happen, all the ice would have to melt first. It&#39;s possible a flood event could happen first or the elite could instigate a third world war to cull the population. Whatever the case, this would be the most remote place the elite could go to hide and rebuild, and in their best interest to keep such a place secret. </p>

<p>The ice will melt eventually, regardless of human interactions, and Antartica will one day be warm and fertile again. At some point, hopefully thousands of years in the future, the planet will enter an age of fire, and the land will burn for a million years or more. Until the climate shifts again and the planet starts another cycle of cooling. </p>

<p>We need more detailed and well researched posts like this.</p>

<p>Definitely adds food for thought for people that want to believe, sceptics, as well as people that are already convinced and simply want to dive deeper into the rabbit-hole.</p>

<p>The Byrd stuff is fascinating. I think you should add more text from him if possible (if you have some good sources available), since people often don&#39;t watch videos. I remember reading quite a bit about the crazy stuff he encountered. Most intriguing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Always appreciate a good Antarctica post! I&#39;m personally inclined to believe that there are entrances at the poles to hollow pockets within the earth. At minimum - cave systems. At maximum - straight up hollow earth. But my intuition says the truth would lie somewhere in the middle.<br/>
I&#39;m fascinated by the nazi engagement with Antarctica and when you dig into it it just gets so much more strange the deeper you get (from a &quot;normal&quot; perspective at least). Breakaway civilizations, occultism, vrill/Kundalini, aliens, advanced science and technology... It&#39;s just fascinating!<br/>
I seriously think that within this human lifetime we&#39;ll see much of this begin to come to light as the ice melts. Sure, it may result in some catastrophic natural disasters in the process, but in the end... It&#39;ll be a whole new world. </p>

<p>I dont think hollow earth would be more plausible than large cave systems and domes.  Be them man made or natural, these spaces are able to be so massive they could be perceived as the earth being hollow.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is an active civilization there or inside the earth (even if it were hollow). I do think there is a lot more going on down there than our governments care to share though. Maybe even some weird shit. I wouldn&#39;t be the least bit surprised if it involved archeology though.</p>

It was considered sort of a plumb assignment for senior staff who wanted to go see something wild. He ran a marathon there, believe it or not. The staff at the base he stayed at are avid runners (as there isn&#39;t much to do there but run marathons, or run experiments).</p>

<p>Interesting footage, but my biggest objection to this theory would be what about photographs from space? Satellite images, and images taken by astronauts do not depict anything particularly interesting on the South Pole. Are we to assume that high res satellite images are all completely faked?</p>
