    <div class="md"><p>I am calling bullshit on your source. SPLC is quite possibly the worst fucking source you could use as they mark literally anything Right Wing as a &quot;terrorist group.&quot; So take your &quot;surge&quot; and fuck off. And the reason for the tag is to make sure I ignore any post you make in future. It&#39;s for me, not you.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;terrorist group&quot;? Moving the goalposts are we?</p>

<p>Why not refute the actual counter? There&#39;s no right wing comparison to Antifa, that there&#39;s no groups on the right designated to fighting &quot;their enemies&quot;? Let&#39;s pick a few. </p>

<p>States with several groups include: Texas (52 groups including American Patriots for Freedom Foundation, Central Texas Militia, Texas Well Regulated Militia); Michigan (47 including Northern Michigan Backyard Protection Militia); California (22 including State of California Unorganized Militia, Northern California State Militia, American Armenian Militia, Freedom Force International); Indiana (21 including Indiana Sedentary Militia, Indiana Citizens Volunteer Militia, 3rd Brigade); New York (17 including Empire State Militia); Oregon (14 including Oregon Militia Corps) and Kentucky (13 including Kentucky State Militia – Ohio Valley Command).</p>

<p>Are you throwing your toys out of the stroller because you&#39;re failing to poison the well? Are you so angry because you feel silly about what you said and don&#39;t know how to counter like an adult? </p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m pulling at threads here. There&#39;s <strong>literally</strong> over 500 examples of how you&#39;re wrong. How you lied. Why not pick a few and look at their manifestos. That <strong>they</strong> write, not the SPLC. Would you like me to pick a few for you or is that rubbing your nose in it?</p>

<p>But sure, &quot;fuck off&quot;, &quot;you&#39;re a bullshitter&quot; &quot;garbage&quot; and &quot;you already lost&quot; is a pretty cool way to admit that you&#39;re wrong too. You&#39;re a pretty stable genius and you really showed me. </p>

<p>Read the thread you&#39;re responding to instead of making up an argument that you can win. It&#39;s pathetic and completely transparent. You literally just made up an argument in your head because you either misread or are completely indoctrinated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus christ. I get it now. Your argument is that you&#39;re playing dumb and that you can&#39;t read. I&#39;ll admit, I can&#39;t debate someone who literally can&#39;t read what he&#39;s debating.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like me saying &quot;Antifa is not a fucking subreddit and Reddit is not owned by the SPLC you dumb retard!&quot;. See? I can put random words that you typed into a sentence and argue against that too. It&#39;s fucking infuriating how you don&#39;t see how completely asinine this looks to everyone else. But that&#39;s probably the point right? </p>

<p>So you&#39;re either that dumb or you&#39;re doing it deliberately. If its the former, do yourself a favour. Go back to the top, spend an hour going through each word. Then put them together into sentences. Then form your argument. Because I&#39;m mortified for you. It&#39;s literally like arguing with a 2 year old. You&#39;ll come out a better man for it. </p>

<p>Anyway, take the last word. You might as well put a star atop this stunning display of your inability to read by doubling down. I&#39;m done. I don&#39;t have the patience to literally teach some clown on Reddit how to read. Full blown anosognosia. </p>

The GOP had spent the past 30 years assailing her and making her a scapegoat, exemplified in 2012 with Benghazi and 2015 with the email controversy. Trump was not some super candidate. Nobody in the Democratic Party even comes close to her unfavorability except some lower level person like Debbie Wassermann Schultz.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Out of the serious prospects right now? Biden leads the pack. He has a strong economic message and is well liked. And no matter how many times the right brings up &quot;creepy Joe touching women,&quot; between him and the POTUS, only Trump has been accused of sexual assault. He&#39;s old though.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s Sanders who remains the most popular Senator in America based on both left and right pollsters. He performed better with Independents than Democrats in polling last year, so I&#39;m not worried about him being painted as some Venezuelan socialist. He has a perception of honesty and conviction. I would be worried about turning out minorities though, and he&#39;s old.</p>

<p>I personally hope Jason Kander runs. He&#39;s young, politically active, and was an army vet. He ran well ahead of Clinton in Missouri last year. I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s ready to run yet though.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t mentioned other candidates like Amy Klobuchar (not the most charismatic), Sherrod Brown, Joe Kennedy III, and Cory Booker (annoyed progressives last year for not voting for Sanders&#39; bill).</p>

<p>The DNC didn&#39;t &quot;run&quot; Clinton, she was picked by Democratic voters. I&#39;m sure there was bias for her, but she would have won regardless with strong support of African Americans and Hispanics. The problem is that Independents did not share the same love of her, which us primary Bernie Sanders supporters argued until we were blue in the face. :)</p>

<p>So why don&#39;t Trump supporters respond to these polls? </p>

<p>Could it be that they are sick and tired of the media and pollsters and scoopsters all taking polls with stupid loaded questions to get the answers they set out to get?  Or how about those tricky polls where they turn positive answers into a negative sentiment.</p>

<p>We have all seen how shady these fucking people are, but then again it takes a certain level of intellect to understand that the only way to win is not to fucking play.</p>

<p>This is a DNC talking point. Both Bill and Hillary have been making corrupt political deals for personal gain since they were still living in Arkansas. Putting Trump aside, you would have to be wildly partisan to not understand that Hillary Clinton has committed many serious crimes. I agree, she&#39;s wildly unpopular, but I disagree that this makes her some kind of victim. She earned her loss. </p>

<p>The people would be better served with a parliamentary republic where a ceremonial president signs pieces of paper and travels around the country doing ceremonial shit while a prime minister is physically in the capital and government departments all the time getting stuff done. </p>

<p>Alternately the Swiss system with no president and rather a rotating chairperson in the federal cabinet is quite interesting. </p>

<p>End of the day in a another system a dotard like Donald would be less dangerous and more manageable. Here we&#39;re left waiting for something 25th amendment weird to happen and bring events to a head. </p>

<p>I firmly believe that you&#39;re an arrogant piece of shit who is trying to force your opinion on people by first trying to shame them into not posting things, and second by your subtly mocking them with statements like this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you read books man, that doesn&#39;t mean that the books you read are anything but distilled nonsense based upon decades of propaganda.  If you&#39;re truly a student of history, especially the history of war then you know that for as long as men have been fighting with other men, it has been necessary to make those men hate each other by telling lies and exaggerating any actual instances of misdeeds.  To sit here and pretend like our society and our leader are any different is absurdly ridiculous.</p>

<p>Any war time &quot;history&quot; should be examined and reexamined, it should be taken with a grain of salt because of the nature of man himself.  Its actually hilarious to look at how similar to our own, the anti-allies propaganda produced from Germany is.  Any sane person can see the writing on the wall there.  </p>

<p>regardless, the stupid &quot;over the top&quot; documentary about &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong&quot; is useful only as a tool to wake up retarded people to the fact that propaganda is REAL, not that Nazis were good.  You&#39;ve missed the entire point of the exercise.</p>

<p>Unfortunately because of mini censors like yourself we have failed to learn this lesson as a society and because of that we continue to fall for the bullshit.  Like we did with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Unstable Ghadaffi, and hilariously now &quot;Trump is literally Hitler&quot; a psychopathic dictator hell bent on deporting all non-whites and starting a nuclear war.</p>

<p>pfffft.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes, it was clearly recommended to recruit a fresh round of Nazis into the Hitler youth program.  As matter of fact, the Jewish run Stormfront website even had a Jewish author claiming to be a Nazi write an article demonstrating how <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was a ripe recruiting grounds for the Hitler youth movement.</p>

<p>In reality, you have no idea why it was posted or why its recommended.</p>

<p>People here just want a different take on such subjects.  They aren&#39;t looking to join Hitler youth.  In case you haven&#39;t heard, the 2nd world war is over, the Nazis were defeated and Hitler is dead.  There is literally zero risk of the 3rd Reich having a resurgence.</p>

<p>Now the 4th Reich, that&#39;s a different story.  And the people writing the propaganda for the 4th Reich won&#39;t be calling themselves Nazis.  They will sneak up on you with a clever new cause and like the Germans who joined the Nazi party before WW2, You&#39;ll likely think its for the best and join yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Out of the serious prospects right now? Biden leads the pack. He has a strong economic message and is well liked. And no matter how many times the right brings up &quot;creepy Joe touching women,&quot; between him and the POTUS, only Trump has been accused of sexual assault. He&#39;s old though.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s Sanders who remains the most popular Senator in America based on both left and right pollsters. He performed better with Independents than Democrats in polling last year, so I&#39;m not worried about him being painted as some Venezuelan socialist. He has a perception of honesty and conviction. I would be worried about turning out minorities though, and he&#39;s old.</p>

<p>I personally hope Jason Kander runs. He&#39;s young, politically active, and was an army vet. He ran well ahead of Clinton in Missouri last year. I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s ready to run yet though.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t mentioned other candidates like Amy Klobuchar (not the most charismatic), Sherrod Brown, Joe Kennedy III, and Cory Booker (annoyed progressives last year for not voting for Sanders&#39; bill).</p>

<p>The DNC didn&#39;t &quot;run&quot; Clinton, she was picked by Democratic voters. I&#39;m sure there was bias for her, but she would have won regardless with strong support of African Americans and Hispanics. The problem is that Independents did not share the same love of her, which us primary Bernie Sanders supporters argued until we were blue in the face. :)</p>

<p>And that certainly wasn&#39;t why the DNC ran her. It wasn&#39;t about the outcome of the 2016 election, it was about the money, power, and influence she held over the DNC. </p>
