At the same time, stories involving the right wing are simply ignored. Where is the outrage over the Catholic Church sexual abuse, which has a long history and continues to this day? What about the House page scandal? A Republican member of Congress admitted to very inappropriate stuff.</p>

<p>Sexual predators don&#39;t just exist with the left. Its everywhere there are vulnerable people. Sports coaches molest their athletes. Youth pastors molest their kids. Bar and restaurant owners sexually assault their pretty bartenders and waitstaff. College professors fuck their students. And on and on and on. Powerful people use their positions for their sexual gratification. This is a world-wide problem and as old as time. </p>

<p>Anytime you see some crime that is unrelated to governing but used to smear a particular &quot;side&quot; and further a political agenda, that should set off your radar. This sub should be smarter than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Voting for Trump isn&#39;t indicative of whether you are a democrat or a republican - and in fact Pew put out data that definitively proves you wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Catholics are divided politically in our survey, just as they were in the 2012 election. While 37% say they favor the GOP, 44% identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party (and 19% say they do not lean either way). In the 2012 election, 50% of Catholics said they voted for Obama, while 48% voted for Romney.</p>

<p>Most weekly churchgoers backed Trump over Clinton, 56% to 40%.

<p>I don&#39;t contend that because it&#39;s not relevant to the argument.</p>

<p>The argument is whether catholics are primary republican or democrat, and I&#39;m the only one who has cited data that directly answers that question, and that data shows 44% of catholics are democrats or lean democrat and 37% for republicans. If you have data that answers <em>that exact question</em> that proves me wrong, than show it. But you haven&#39;t, because you don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple things.  First, it appears Catholics are split between Democrat and Republican: <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2016/09/13/2-party-affiliation-among-voters-1992-2016/">Source</a>.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Catholics are split in their partisan preferences: About as many affiliate with the GOP (47%) as the Democratic Party (46%). The Democratic Party has traditionally enjoyed an advantaged in leaned party affiliation among all Catholics, but the GOP has made gains in recent years: 2013 marked the first time in about two decades that Catholics were no more likely to affiliate with the Democratic Party than the Republican Party.    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second, my point being that more devout Catholics are more likely to be further right (as my previous post indicated).  Most Catholics don’t practice, the ones who do are more likely to be conservative.  When talking about priests (the original comment), they are obviously very devout and more likely conservative.   </p>

<p>Regardless, it is a stupid argument that devolved into a partisan bicker.  I apologize and would like to say that sexual predators are not a party issue.  It happens everywhere.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to think its because of politics. Here is how it works.</p>

<ul>
<li>People in power victimize people.</li>
<li>People in Hollywood have power.</li>
<li>Some people in Hollywood victimize people.</li>
<li>Some people in Hollywood will cover up for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apply that to news media:</p>

<ul>
<li>People in power victimize people.</li>
<li>People at Foxnews have power.</li>
<li>Some people at Foxnews victimize people.</li>
<li>Some people at Foxnews will cover up for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or religion:</p>

<ul>
<li>People in power victimize people.</li>
<li>People in the church have power.</li>
<li>Some people in the church victimize people.</li>
<li>Some people in the church will cover up for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>This shit is literally everwhere there is a power dynamic. Coaches with athletes, teachers with students, youth pastors with church kids, etc etc etc. Its apolitical.</p>
