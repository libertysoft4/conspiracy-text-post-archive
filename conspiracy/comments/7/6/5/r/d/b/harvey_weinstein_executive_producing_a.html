    <div class="md"><p>That makes sense. If Weinstein is really out to get Trump, it stands to reason that Trump would fight back. It raises a couple of questions, though. Like, what is Weinstein going to put out that would damn Trump enough to ruin his whole life/career?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right - why is he doing movies that put him in the line of fire if he has all these skeletons in his closet? 
It&#39;s horrible to think about, but it must mean Trump has done something worse then systemic sexual assault and abuse. Cause Weinstein wouldn&#39;t have blinked an eye at that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or it&#39;s a diversion. Look at how bad Trump is, he walked back stage at the Miss Teen USA contest. Yeah, thats bad and gross. Weinstein actually assaulted these kids/people. I don&#39;t think he views one as worse than the other, just that &quot;Trump did this, and no one is going to say anything about me because they&#39;ll be black-balled.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a testimate to the ego involved in this whole thing. People with money and/or power fear losing their money and power. Thats why they do such shitty things to stay in a position of power, and keep making money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgive me for trying to clarify and understand your point...
But I would argue that the hacks have been non-partisan. Especially considering the focus on Hillary and Podesta. Nothing has been leaked that did any damage at all to Trump.  He&#39;s sitting pretty right now.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has been in the public eye for literally decades, and people have hated him for decades (including me). And that isn&#39;t &quot;some guy,&quot; that&#39;s the editor of SPY and later Vogue. </p>

<p>I&#39;m old, man. I used to listen to Stern. He wasn&#39;t on Stern because he was a cool dude who everyone liked, he was on Stern all the time because he&#39;s a fucking clown, a caricature of a rich piece of shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha no, you stopped the conversation because I presented evidence and took a stance and you had nothing. You&#39;ve drank the kool-aid so anything that fucks with said kool-aid hurts your brain and you take a run for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or it&#39;s a diversion. Look at how bad Trump is, he walked back stage at the Miss Teen USA contest. Yeah, thats bad and gross. Weinstein actually assaulted these kids/people. I don&#39;t think he views one as worse than the other, just that &quot;Trump did this, and no one is going to say anything about me because they&#39;ll be black-balled.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a testimate to the ego involved in this whole thing. People with money and/or power fear losing their money and power. Thats why they do such shitty things to stay in a position of power, and keep making money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgive me for trying to clarify and understand your point...
But I would argue that the hacks have been non-partisan. Especially considering the focus on Hillary and Podesta. Nothing has been leaked that did any damage at all to Trump.  He&#39;s sitting pretty right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol I hate Trump for the things he&#39;s done and the things he stands for. Things that are out in the open. I think 16 accusations of sexual assault and an open admission to regularly doing so is a good place to start.</p>
