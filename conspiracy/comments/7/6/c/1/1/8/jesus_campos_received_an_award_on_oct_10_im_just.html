<p>This very man gets an award in public for being the hero of the night during the biggest mass murder in modern US history and NOT ONE SINGLE REPORTER IS THERE TO RECORD IT?  Really?  All they release is 2 bad quality pictures with 4 guys around him?</p>

<p>You save a drowning kid and you&#39;ll be SURROUNDED by reporters.  And this guy?  Nothing?  OMG.</p>

<p>Has the world gone insane?  They accuse us of being conspiracy theorist and wearing tin foil hats.  But my god, how blind do you have to be to not be able to see that something is wrong here.     </p>

Well haven&#39;t seen her in years, but what&#39;s interesting is she used to(still probably) goes to Disneyland all the time(we&#39;re 27). What matters is that she attends that club 33 each of those times and her family is loaded of course. Just insinuating that if you were to meet a Hollywood type pushing an agenda it could be there. And not saying she&#39;s a crisis actor, and that her being at the shooting makes it all the more real to me, but if someone I knew would be one it&#39;d be her lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree there are super weird circumstances surrounding both Vegas and Sandy Hook. But think this through logically. You admit their is a shadow group of some sort that is powerful and nefarious enough to stage MASSIVE events with the coordination of thousands of people (and an entire town in SH case) but they just aren&#39;t evil enough to send a small group of like 5 guys into Vegas and shoot real people. What&#39;s the easier thing to do between those 2 options? Thousands of people versus a small elite group of killers? And on top of all that, don&#39;t forget that there are just evil POS people that want to kill hordes of people for whatever reason...it&#39;s been a repeating theme through history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and respond to your statement &quot;I don&#39;t believe anyone was shot&quot; as something you truly believe instead of a remark to upset people by letting you know that you can in fact prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that several people died- all you have to do is search on any search engine (I&#39;d post a link but I don&#39;t want to seem like I&#39;m just showing info to support my claims) for the names of those who died and then search for them on Facebook or other social media/search engines and you will in fact see they were real people and are no longer alive. </p>

<p>I mention Facebook first because it&#39;s one of the quickest ways to confirm someone is deceased- once they receive official notice (like death certificate) that persons page is changed from a regular profile to a remembrance page, which ONLY happens when that individual is absolutely confirmed to have passed away. I personally know several people who were killed in the shooting and all their Facebook pages have been converted to remembrance pages, but what&#39;s key here is that you can still see lots of information about them (not just pictures) including their workplace, school, full names of people they knew which can all be verified as well. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like Facebook then you can still check other social media, search engines with their full name, or local newspapers reporting the deaths (my local newspaper dedicated a significant amount of space on each of the 4 victims from the area with plenty of verifiable info and quotes from their loved ones and coworkers etc.) to name a few things. </p>

<p>Bottom line is there are several different ways (which are both quick and easy) to get definitive proof that the victims were in fact real people that are now deceased, so there&#39;s truly no reason anyone should be claiming that no one was hurt, unless you&#39;re just trying to upset people. 
So if you sincerely are seeking the truth here, the best way to start is by confirming or denying things you believe before forming opinions... you&#39;ll get a lot closer to the truth that way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really are pitching Facebook for a confirmation source? Facebook is a media magnet tar pit. Anyways let me ask you what you think about summer of the hero&#39;s like Jesus and Mike Cronk who&#39;s buddy survived 3 to the chest. Do you believe these people are genuine and their stories are factual? How about the woman who was interviewed that was on Dr. Phil? Coincidences? Would you do an interview a day after being shot with nothing but smiles? I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facebook is definitely not a source of purely factual information and I wouldn&#39;t believe most of what I read there, I&#39;m pitching it as one thing- a way to connect the names of the deceased to their pages containing their connections to other individuals, their workplace, school, etc. so that it can be confirmed the names are of real people, and that those people have in fact passed away.  </p>

<p>Some of the people allegedly present have displayed &quot;unusual&quot; behavior and done things contrary to what we believe people should do in these situations, but it&#39;s very true that you never know how you or anyone else will respond to a situation like that until you&#39;re in one, often due to shock that some experience where their brains protect themselves by not processing emotions right away... and who&#39;s going to be responding to requests for interviews and making statements? Not the traumatized people responding the way we expect, but the ones in shock that feel good enough to- strange behavior certainly does not automatically = lies, but it does absolutely mean we need to find out more. </p>

<p>We should be, need to be skeptical of all facts presented to us, but while accepting everything as truth is bad, being overly skeptical can be just as harmful. In response to your questions, I have more questions than answers and I do believe we have been told untrue things- All I am saying is that certain things, like the fact that several people died, can definitively be proven which I know because unfortunately I knew many in attendance, but don&#39;t believe that because a random person on the internet said it&#39;s true- because it can be proven with very little time and effort. </p>

<p>If we all focus on looking in the right places there&#39;s a very good shot we can figure some real truths out which is why I took the time to explain in the first place. But to figure anything out we need to take the provable facts and set them aside we can focus on the real unknowns and put the pieces together to find the truth, but we can only find truth from truth, or we&#39;ll be chasing around ideas not rooted in reality and get nowhere. That&#39;s why this is important. First step in finding out what really happened is separating and accepting the facts, and these deaths are indisputable facts. 
Happy to help with information searching to anyone interested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, here is the proof of one of the victims existence and death from the Route 91 shooting.  </p>

<p>I took most of these screen shots a few days ago when I replied telling you I was gathering proof so the dates/numbers are not current, just FYI. </p>

<p>However, all of these images are just that, screenshots of information readily available to anyone on the internet which can ALL be verified independently if there is any doubt whatsoever that I have fabricated/doctored anything at all. </p>

<p>Her name is Keri Galvan and I have added some explanations below with the images. </p>

Yelp listing for her place of work, Mastro&#39;s in Thousand Oaks, California. Shows their address and phone number and several hundred reviews, proving it does exist and has for some time. If you&#39;d like additional proof you can call the phone number, check the address on satellite images, etc.

Another news outlet reporting on her death. There are several more as well, just wanted to include more than one here. </p>

<p>So there you go. This is just one person I chose, could have done it for several more as well if I had the time but as mentioned this is not information only I have access to, anyone interested can do the same research.  </p>

<p>If anyone&#39;s interested, I have included a link below which has the names of all victims who perished during the attack:<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.legacy.com/amp/news/celebrity-deaths/notable-deaths/article/las-vegas-strip-shooting-victims-2017-0">https://www.google.com/amp/www.legacy.com/amp/news/celebrity-deaths/notable-deaths/article/las-vegas-strip-shooting-victims-2017-0</a></p>

<p>They hate the idea of Jesus, and consider Muhammed the only true prophet.

    <div class="md"><p>Doubt it the officials ruled out terror groups in the first few hours. If they switched now after the sheriff made grand sweeping statements like there were no other people on the loose. Interesting phrasing he didnt say in the last press com that there was no one else involved just no one else involved who might be a continued threat. That statement was legalese and allowed things like dead more bad guys or bad guys that they know are finished with whatever the op was. The sheriff saying that the purpose of the press conferences was to calm the public not explain the criminal investigation. Yet during the week they were putting up billboards asking for help. Usually more details and footage would be released. Why cant they produce a pic of him gambling and going up to his room?</p>

<p>Jesus is the only witness who (supposedly) saw the (alleged) shooter in action.</p>

<p>Had the (alleged) shooter survived, Jesus would have to testify against him in court, but because the (alleged) shooter did not survive, he is presumed guilty. Case closed.</p>

<p>So I guess you&#39;re right, Jesus doesn&#39;t have to do anything. He&#39;ll probably retire in Honduras or Nicaragua or wherever.</p>

Then when you point out a mistake, they say there&#39;s no way they would fuck up that badly. &quot;They are smart enough to conspire and keep it hidden from the public, but they also make dumb mistakes?&quot; This line of reasoning doesn&#39;t make any sense. The reality is that it&#39;s a little of both. People are fallible. Even intelligent people fuck up sometimes.

    <div class="md"><p>Here’s what I think. It could be as it has been explained. Campos could be camera shy or hiding something that is unrelated or the government is the conspirator. Let me challenge that with a more insidious plot. </p>

<p>What if it was all a ploy by weapon manufacturers and weapon accessory makers. Guns are like a precious commodity. Hell its even like oil, when there is speculation the prices can soar. </p>

<p>Think about it. If anti gun activists make a big enough stink, laws will be written to ban bump fire stocks and high cap magazines (for example). When a law is implemented for weapons, it always states that anything built/manufactured prior to the law is exempt and anything built after said date is a federal crime. Well then you can say a typical 30 round mag which sold for $25, now sells for $75 dollars. These bans come and go. Only thing that changes is the bank accounts of those vested in weapons and arms manufacturing. Also surplus will always be there, banning further builds is pointless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not saying that’s what happened or has happened. Whenever I read anything about an incident, regardless of it coming from multiple sources it always falls right on to the government (by no means am I saying they don’t do things). No one ever looks into these interest groups or other organizations. When I was overseas, my job put me in contact with a lot of those groups that have zero accountability. I’ve seen very bad things happen and how they were swept away. Nothing of this magnitude but nonetheless people lost lives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking about him possibly being held hostage as well. </p>

<p>My line of thinking is that he is known to be an accomplice. The FBI is holding him in custody and &quot;interrogating&quot; him because they know this was not a two-man job. They want it to appear like they are not looking for anyone else so as to not alert the additional accomplices. Make Campos out to be a hero to fool the responsible people/organization into thinking they got away with it.</p>

<p>Perhaps he disappeared before the interviews because he <em>escaped</em>. The FBI didn&#39;t want to draw suspicion, so his &quot;bodyguards&quot; were not present, at least in the immediate area. Jesus saw his chance and booked it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to go a step further and say the FBI <em>wanted</em> him to escape. Maybe he just wasn&#39;t talking, and they are following him to see if he leads them to whoever it is they&#39;re looking for.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe he was an FBI agent. He looks like a corpse in every picture. I could imagine that if I were being tortured for information that I wouldn&#39;t look very alive in pictures my torturers forced me to take.</p>

They&#39;d need to be able to show who added that employee, with a timestamp, it would be linked to other records, are they full time, part time, event staff? There&#39;s just so much data a large company would need.. and that guy would have been able to pull it up.</p>

<p>The odds of them outsourcing to a shitty 3rd party is simply closer to 0, because all their investments are based on liability.</p>

<p>No doubt they would, agree 100%</p>

<p>I doubt this information was supplied by a manager or higher-up with access to that information. It is likely a compartmented system with information access restricted. I would be interested in who supplied this and what their authority level is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was that I&#39;ve worked in IT(at more than one large company), where I needed the most limited access to the HR database, and there were edit buttons and plenty of functionality, that when interacted with would simply have greyed out words. All the information stated was there, just not information like social security and whatnot that would require someone with higher level access.</p>

<p>To have an entirely different scheme isn&#39;t how businesses or 3rd parties typically do it, the layout would be exactly the same, functionality is what would be different.</p>

<p>Again, this ultra simple WordPress looking site simply wouldn&#39;t be what a large casino would be using in a high liability environment.</p>

<p>Even if I don&#39;t find Laura Loomer credible, I find her more credible than those shitty screenshots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, even though sheriff has speculated that this old guy would have likely needed help, and I&#39;ve always been willing to entertain that. I mean, if he was drilling when the security guard was around, then how did he see him? I understand there&#39;s a camera, but it&#39;s kind of hard to drill while looking somewhere else.</p>

<p>The idea that he hadn&#39;t finished preparing (drilling) and that there&#39;s all that unused explosive in his car could just as well be indicators that he didn&#39;t have help, and couldn&#39;t accomplish everything in time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might be worthy of its own post, but what about the drilling? They just backtracked on the whole &quot;Campos was there before he opened fire on the crowd&quot;, but they had said on Monday that he heard drilling.. but they also said he was shot at some point while he was already shooting at the crowd.</p>

<p>When and how did he hear the drilling, which they confirmed Monday that he did and that it wasn&#39;t complete.. it makes no fucking sense.</p>

<p>He was definitely behind. But what they said at the press conference yesterday is Campos was shot sometime after he started firing into the crowd, is he running back and forth looking at the camera footage? </p>

<p>Just nothing that&#39;s been admittedly said by the guard checks out, much less the engineer that was supposed to be there too. It just makes zero fucking sense.</p>

<p>Basically, they&#39;re saying that Campos reached the barricaded door at 6 minutes before the shooting, and reached the floor where the shooter was 6 minutes later. They don&#39;t specify when he was shot, just that he was shot before police arrived 12 minutes later (which means it could be anytime during the shooting).</p>

<p>He gets pretty emotional, he talks about how offended he is that people think he&#39;s lying, he says people need to stop making conspiracy theories, officially says no one is lying.. it&#39;s worth a watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he was an illegal, the CEO would not be having his name in the database as the one who added him.  It would have been tagged with someone disposable and given the CEO plausible deniability.</p>

<p>But, if the FBI or CIA  (or other) had approached them, saying they needed an operative on the system - to enable system security access and provide a cover.  Then the people who would have known would be limited to the top management, e.g. CEO and security head.  And they would be held to secrecy, probably under the Defense Secrets act.</p>

<p>Except it looks like they might of done a little insider trading along the way.  But if held under the DS act, they are probably not legally allowed to disclose that anyway, save they indict themselves.  Convieniently.</p>

<p>6 figures for home movies of a lady in a story not as big as the Vegas shooting. This guard could make 250,000k easily. But I&#39;m sure he is just sooooooo shocked and needs time to recover. Security guards make a killing!</p>

<p>Also last week, ABC announced that Diane Sawyer had secured the first-ever interview with Jaycee Lee Dugard, the young woman held captive for 18 years in California. ABC declared that it had not paid any fee for the interview, but last year, according to a longtime ABC News executive aware of the deal, the network paid a six-figure sum for rights to home movies of Ms. Dugard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your saying that in however many minutes is just enough time to do everything right given now you know a lot about this case. Imagine putting yourself in that situation not knowing anything and getting shot at while figuring out what is going on and if there could be more than one shooter in another room. Now your saying that they couldn&#39;t get there in 40 minutes. Do you realize that your dealing with more than one room at the Mandalay Bay? Do you know how many rooms are in that hotel? If you are being serious with these claims I think you need to wait a little longer and see what&#39;ll happen next. You just don&#39;t make sense. </p>

<p>The alarm was not the fire alarm. It&#39;s the alarm from leaving a door open. Isn&#39;t that why he first went there? The guy couldn&#39;t even get to the room from the stairs because that was barricaded shut. So he had to enter from down the hallway which Stephen was watching with his camera he had setup on a food cart adjacent to his door. It makes sense to me. Not sure why everyone is having trouble understanding this or what people are choosing to believe over what not to believe. </p>

<p>FBI didn&#39;t axe the interview. Give me proof on that. The security guard gave a phone interview with ABC news. I&#39;m sure he will talk about what went on in person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, you will be removed from the casino within seconds if they think you&#39;re counting cards. Taking over 40 minutes for security to show up is absolutely significant. </p>

<p>And there was a journalist, forget her name, who found out that the FBI axed. Seeing as she&#39;s been the only one <em>really</em> investigating Vegas I&#39;m inclined to believe her. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand what I said, and that&#39;s okay. Security monitors card games in the casino they have cameras everywhere. Security doesn&#39;t monitor what goes on inside of a hotel room they don&#39;t have cameras all over inside of a hotel room. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m arguing this.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to offend anyone with this comment and please HahThatsSilly please don&#39;t take it personally, as I am saying this is in a general sense- </p>

<p>Has anyone truly considered that a reason why he may not be very public right now is because everyone is frustrated, angry and suspicious about the quality of information released, causing amongst other things lots of speculation, so being out in the public eye before an acceptable explanation has been given he&#39;s worried anything he says or does could cause people to form ideas and turn against him? 
Sorry that&#39;s a bit of a run on, but you know what I mean- This guy is allegedly just a regular security guard, never been in the spotlight and who knows how he comfortable he is with public speaking, and then suddenly he&#39;s a key person in the biggest mass shooting of modern times, thrust into the spotlight, his name and picture everywhere and everyone wants to speak to him- imagine how most would feel about that in itself! Most wouldn&#39;t go running towards the interviews even with $ because that&#39;s terrifying (public speaking is feared more than death studies have shown) - that in itself is a lot for anyone to handle, but he also has the traumatic experience that got him to this place... and if you&#39;ve been shot at or seen someone get shot, you know how traumatic it is and how you don&#39;t know how you&#39;ll handle it until it happens to you. 
So all I&#39;m saying is everyone frustrated about him not being more public, giving interviews, etc. just really truly stop and try to imagine what he must be going through and what the smartest thing to do would be- do you give interviews? Which may come with money but one wrong word, one nervous mannerism misinterpreted, any little mistake could result in assumptions being made that can and will ruin your life and put the safety of your family at risk as well. So yeah you could do that... or, you could lay low, focus on moving forward from the traumatic incident and staying safe which means staying out of the spotlight. 
We ALL want answers and we deserve them.  All I&#39;m saying is remember the people involved in this that may hold some of those answers we want to badly are just that, people, regular people that are likely in survival mode themselves so let&#39;s channel our energy in the right places so we can get those answers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO the most likely thing is Campos has some mental defficiency. Perhaps bad social anxiety mixed with poor English skills. So he doesn&#39;t really want to speak and the hotel doesn&#39;t really want him to speak because he will not do a good job. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not totally writing off conspiracies with him. It&#39;s definitely possible. I just am waiting to see.</p>

<p>Don’t believe anything being said about timelines and the events taking place during them. MGM knows exactly what took place as well as the FBI. The true evidence will never become public for civilians to see. The reason for this is because, Americans cannot know the truth about how dangerous it is becoming within their own country</p>
