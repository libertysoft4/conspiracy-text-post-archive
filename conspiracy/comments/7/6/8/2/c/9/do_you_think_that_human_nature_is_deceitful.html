    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily <em>exclusively</em> deceitful - no.  Human nature, of course <em>can</em> be deceitful - especially if it serves an advantageous purpose for the individual in question.  However, I wouldn’t say that human nature is, again, <em>necessarily</em> deceitful - as in being deceitful “just because” when being truth can be more advantageous.</p>

<p>Problem isn’t deceit.  Problem is ignorance.  We’re ignorant - by nature.  We are born that way to a large extent.  What’s happened is that greater powers and intelligences than ours have come in and manipulated our impressionability, and those intelligences have polluted our thinking in a manner that isn’t necessarily the way we would evolve and develop on our own <em>without</em> that influence.</p>

<p>We’re not by nature deceitful, but we have been made to be to a great extent such by outside forces.  We have been manipulated into being to a great extent deceitful in a manner that wouldn’t necessarily otherwise be the case.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  In a certain sense, you are not incorrect.  The public has indeed given its consent.  However, it’s a “deal with the devil” kind of scenario that has taken place where the population likely had little if any idea of what in fact it was getting itself into when it agreed (covertly or otherwise) to go along with the machinations that have been put in place.</p>

<p>Now we’re stuck, and many of us are like “Shit!  Wait!  I didn’t sign up for this!!” and it’s to a large extent too late for many of us…and now we’re stuck in the muck and we have to work our way out of this imbroglio we’ve found ourselves in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Issue here is double-edged, responsibility lies in our actions more than their baleful agenda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Abso-fucking-<em>lutely</em>.  THIS.  This is the idea.  You’re right.  TPTB are indeed very powerful and influential.  However, we can’t necessarily be forced to do anything we don’t want to or are told that we &quot;need&quot; to do in some manner or the other.</p>

<p>What this means is that it’s all ultimately up to <em>us</em> and our own decisions.  WE are the ones who do the things - we aren’t necessarily forced to do them.  We can be manipulated - yes.  However, it really is ultimately our decision to do or not do a thing - and too many of us fall for the bait and allow ourselves to become powerless when we don’t have to be such.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every man for himself, that&#39;s what it has been since the dawn of humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is correct and not-so-correct both at the same time.  Every person has their own level of responsibility - yes.  However, we are indeed a collective.  We are indeed a unified field.  The truth behind the holographic universe model of existence (i.e. that the whole of the macrocosm exists inside every microcosm no matter how small) applies to literally <em>everything</em> - not just stars and quasars, but to humans as well.  We are all connected.  As such, although we do all have to find our way on our own, we are indeed all in this together, and we can absolutely help each other along the way.  We are horses that can’t be <em>forced</em> to drink - this is true - but we can certainly be helped along our journey and pointed in the direction of the occasional trough of water to quench our thirsts along the treacherous path before us.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><del>I personally feel that the paradigm that much of this world is driven by is indeed deceitful - yes - but it is driven not entirely by the selfishness and greed of the populace for power and bogus stability per se as much as it’s driven by the <em>ignorance</em> of a populace that has been fooled into moving toward things that are against its ultimate better, long term good.  In other words, many of us have been convinced that “XYZ” is better for us, when it is in fact <em>worse</em> for us.  So long as we keep doing XYZ, however, we fall further and further behind on the path toward our personal and collective evolution and growth.</del></p>

<p><del>Therefore, I’d say that the paradigm under which we live is indeed deceitful - yes - but, although I don’t doubt that many humans have since gone quite along with that deceitful paradigm (sort of like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7BuQFUhsRM">Cypher</a>), I’m not sure that the <em>initiation</em> of that deceitful paradigm was entirely brought about by humans alone (if at all).</del></p>

<p>I initially posted a long response to this, but after reading your comment again, I realized that you are actually entirely right in what you said.  We are part of a deceitful paradigm driven to a great extent by human selfishness, ignorance, and greed, unfortunately.</p>

<p>If we fight agains that selfishness, ignorance, and greed, however, we have a much better chance to improve and evolve ourselves, and our civilization around us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mere scenario that I reckon in which the population may unify toward an aim is during turmoil as the status quo is inimical to their interests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see this point, and I can understand why it definitely seems that way on a certain level.  However, I’m personally not convinced that the only manner under which humans would willingly join forces involves some sort of pointed duress or some other calamity.  This is how the covert PTB think and operate, and this is the basis behind the many calamitous false flag attacks they stage.  I feel humans can congregate under positive, collective circumstances as well, however.  We are, after all, social animals, and there have been many circumstances when forces are joined voluntarily for a greater good that aren’t initiated by calamitous circumstances.</p>

<p>There is a great, covert power at work, however, which pushes much of society toward a feeling of ongoing and continuous conflict - a conflict borne out of racial strife, economic inequality, gender differentiations, and a whole slue of other issues that are instigated and kept continually ignited by a complicit MSM whose job it is to keep the population at odds and conflicted with itself - and the constant pushing and propagating of that conflict generally keeps the population continuously antagonistic with itself; constantly fighting and bickering and quarreling with each other for so many inconsequential and ultimately unnecessary reasons, and this makes the population not only confused and more dumbed down (since so many of us are expending so much mental energy being convinced to fight and bicker with one another instead of using that mental energy to think intelligently), but it also make everyone far weaker, far more separated from being a unified, collective, strong and powerful whole, and far, far more easy to control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>deception will always be amongst us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  Agreed.  At least on this plane of existence this is true.  However, we can develop and evolve a methodology to effectively and consistently fight that deception.  After all - and to use an epidemiological analogy here if I may - just because germs will always be in the air, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you will always therefore be constantly sick.  No.  You can develop powerful antigens that help you fight the germs and diseases around you.  You can exercise and eat/live as healthily and cleanly as possible so as to give yourself and your body the best opportunity to keep the germs and the sickness away.</p>

<p>Deception will always be amongst us, but if we also constantly keep intelligence, patience, and critical thinking amongst us as well, and firmly in our mind, then we can be as protected as possible from being unnecessarily trapped and ensnared and taken in by the deception that exists around us.  We can protect ourselves and keep ourselves from being helpless against the deceit existing around us.</p>

<p>Yes.  Absolutely.  Agreed.  However, this would generally cause people to <em>not</em> go to war with one another in the long run, and TPTB don’t want that.  They want war.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfEBupAeo4">War makes money</a> in their eyes.  They therefore make sure and maintain at least a decent modicum of antagonism going on in society so that most countries are ready to fight each other every few years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The status quo fuels the emergence of vile things within us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It certainly can on one level, but I wouldn’t say it does so <em>entirely</em>.  I wouldn’t castigate the status quo completely and say that there is <em>nothing</em> good about it.  The status quo is the status quo for a reason after all - and that reason tends to be that there’s at least <em>some</em> aspects of it that are viable and decent enough for <em>enough</em> people in society.  The status quo is kind of like the “middle of the road” approach to things:  Not to great, not too horrible; not too high, not too low.  There’s definitely something to be said about “living in the middle” in society.</p>

<p>All this said, I agree with your sentiment that the status quo can indeed tend to invite aspects of comportment in people that eschew creativity, that do away with uniqueness, and that make many things more bland than would otherwise be the case - and this is not necessarily a good thing in society in and of itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It plays a prominent role but it is also our fault for letting it spread because we are puny against our needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would certainly seem that we are indeed puny against our needs.  However, depending on what those needs are, I feel that we can rise above at least some things in our lives that aren’t entirely necessary and end up coming out better for the effort in the end.  We may indeed be puny against our needs, but great things have been accomplished by various humans that went <em>against</em> their needs.</p>

<p>It’s most definitely a racket.  Yes.  The gun industry isn’t the only beneficiary of wars by any means whatsoever, however.  The steel, engineering, textile, and vehicle manufacturing industries benefit just as much if not more than the gun and armament industries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not have the reference to an interesting article that talks about the gun industry as being the cream of the crop regarding profitability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That may be true, as guns and ammo are part and parcel of every war, but - again - the racket goes far deeper than just guns alone.</p>

<p>In addition to all the industries that profit and the vast amounts of money accumulated through war, there is the added benefit (in the eyes of an elite that wish to keep us weak and separated from each other anyway) of humanity being at odds with each other - and as I said in a prior comment, division keeps a society weak, easy to manipulate, and easy to rule over.</p>

<p>It would certainly seem - yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were, and there are many people who overcome the negative sway of their needs for the greater good of society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though I agree that having no wars creates a good, amiable society, there is a particular school of thought that lets it be known that on a very, very deep, spiritual level, there is an organization of covert, extremely powerful societies working on this planet whose interest it is to elevate the vibration of humanity above both good and evil - but the method that they use in order to do this is to bombard the civilization with overwhelming amounts of both good and bad.  This way, the humans living on Earth will slowly learn and come to realize that neither the great good on this planet <em>nor</em> the great negative should be anything to ultimately strive for or really go after.  It’s said that one way we learn this is by literally being bombarded with and overwhelmed by both good and evil on this planet until we realize that going after either option is really not all that great a thing to do.  We’re like Willy Wonka at a candy store who overindulges on all the free candy he can eat, but then realizes that doing so isn’t the best idea after getting horribly sick having eaten all that candy.</p>

<p>In other words, in the eyes of this theory, it’s said that one of the best ways we’ll learn what to do and what not to do is to be presented with copious amounts of both and letting us have our absolute fill of everything, and then experiencing the consequences (usually negative) that come with such overindulgence.</p>

<p>That way we learn (in lifetime after lifetime after lifetime) that going for either the good <em>or</em> the bad is perhaps not the best thing in the world, and better still would be to simply transcend and rise above both the good and the bad of this world.</p>

<p>Complicated stuff, but there it is nonetheless.</p>

<p>Yep.  Very correct, sir.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>TPTB don’t generally like too much of this, however.  Again, peace doesn’t sell war, and war makes them money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Education is the bedrock of an advanced and amiable society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is the very reason why the educational system is to a great extent about producing mindless, obedient cogs more than independent critical thinkers.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Exactly this, unfortunately.  Exactly this.</p>

<p>What this means is that a large part of an individual’s true eduction has to be taken on by the person themselves.  Self-education is the way to grow at this point in this society.  What makes it all the more difficult is that the method of greatest self-education in this day and age is the internet, and TPTB have been working quite heavily at curtailing more and more of the free flow of information on the internet every day.</p>

<p>Self-education caters more knowledge to the individuals if the latter have the will to hone their talents through research and daily practice. </p>

<p>I am an advocate for homeschooling. Unfortunately, wherein I live it is quasi-nonexistent, and thereby I would have loved if I had the opportunity to educate myself from primary to higher education without indoctrination in the schools, which are these days businesses that seek financial profit.   </p>

<p>The Tabula Rasa theory is one that has been promulgated by the West for quite a long time.  I think it’s relatively valid enough to say that we are born as white papers w/o ink, and I feel I understand your point…however, I think the actual truth is that we are born with great, great volumes of experience written all over us, and we are born likely after having experienced many, may lives indeed.  Dr. Raymond Moody, Dr. Ian Stevenson, and Dr. Elizabeth Kubler Ross have written various important, academic books in the field of reincarnation that cannot easily be denied.</p>

<p>Your point, however (and again), I feel is a valid enough one.  Whether we had countless lives before this one or not, it seems to be definitely the case that we are at least born with a “mind wipe” of sorts that prevents most of us from remembering too much of anything that happened before this current incarnation, and which causes us to come into this world and this life as if anew and with little if any real memory of anything before.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, the “means justifies the ends” dictum is one that I don’t think applies all the time in the least.  Yes, I feel it definitely applies sometimes, and there have been times when a certain level of deception is not necessarily the worst thing in the world.  [An immediate example that comes to mind involves something as innocuous as, say, Christmas, and the penchant most Westerners have for using deception in telling their children where the gifts under the tree came from.  “They’re from Santa!”]  However, as a general rule, I tend to feel that honesty is the best policy.  It’s certainly not always the most pain-free policy, but I feel in the long run, it’s best to be as honest as possible in one’s life.</p>
