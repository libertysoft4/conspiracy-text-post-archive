    <div class="md"><p>There wouldn&#39;t be mandatory vaccinations... hmmmm. </p>

<p>I was homeschooled for one year of my life and my mom wasn&#39;t really prepared for it. 7th grade. I think it&#39;s a pretty pivotal year in school. A lot of my friends got their first kisses and more while I learned how to A) Help my mother do taxes for both of my parents B) go grocery shopping with a list, a budget, and some nice home cooked desserts in mind (mind you my parents have never made much so this!!) C) interact with adults more so than my own peers (adults are good at living ACTUAL life in this day and age, occasionally) D) sleep on a schedule that was good for me rather than what was mandated by my school hours E) explore my own interests more while also accomplishing enough that my tester lady at the end of the year wanted to give me the 8th, 9th, and 10th grade standardized tests (because my brother was also homeschooled that year and was in 10th grade and I basically learned enough throughout the ONE YEAR to be looked at for jumping ahead) F) love myself for the awkward little girl who hated showering that I was rather than be told by my peers what was &quot;normal.&quot; </p>

<p>I am in no way 100% advocating homeschooling for an entire 18 years, but I truly believe that people who have life experience are better left without so so many rules as regulations as to what they are allowed to teach. Homeschooling is an amazing platform for learning and self discovery.</p>

<p>Plus, if you learn what you&#39;re interested in, you tend to forget less. I know more about weather than most people that I know, because not only did I study lectures and books on it, I studied IT. This is an experience that most people don&#39;t get (in the ways that I did) until they reach a higher education beyond an associated or even bachelors. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my take on it, but what do I know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just make sure that they do get enough peer time as well! They have plenty of group activities for homeschooled kids like filed trips and even graduations. And don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll be who they are pretty much regardless of what you do, as long as you remind them that they&#39;re valued as individuals. My mother always says that the one thing I learned that year, above all else, was to think for myself and to teach myself. Pretty valuable when entering back into public school. I basically just bullshitted and never went to class and graduated with a 4.7 (then dropped out of college twice! Ha! Kids will be kids)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except for mandatory vaccination (and it&#39;s not only for schools, in my country you need to be vaccinated for federal / government jobs - not all vaccines, only 2 are mandatory]) if you didn&#39;t do any of the rest on the list, who was there to stop you, but yourself ? What the fuck are you on about? </p>

<p>I studied all my life in public schools. On my spare time I did theater, played hockey, was a swimmer, studied music and learnt how to play the piano. had part-times in the summer and still was together with my friends almost every afternoon (studying or chilling), going out every Friday and Saturday. Went to Sunday school for 10 years. 
Tried guitar, tennis and was a member of the biology club for 2 years in high school.
Currently finished medschool.</p>

<p>Only thing I do agree, is why did I have to learn useless subjects that offer me 0 benefits in life/career of choice. People should be able to come up with their own school program and mandatory subject where they learn useful stuff like filling taxes, politics basics, etc. </p>

Just saying that A allowed for something that B, makes no sense when it&#39;s all possible regardless of A or B. In fact being home schooled doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll do all of the above. It&#39;s all up to you... </p>
