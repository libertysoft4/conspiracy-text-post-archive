        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe the security guard went up to this room by himself for a reason. I worked at major hotels in the past, security is always paired up. So for this security guard to go the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay in the middle of the night by himself and knock on the shooters door before the shooting occurred is odd. In addition, all security guards have radios and cell phones. For the security guard not to call anyone before or after he got shot and took the police that long is absurd. Also, the fact the shooter had access to the service elevator is strange. Side note, the security guard is an armed guard as well which could play out to be the 2nd shooter. Since it does take many hours and hours of training to be that good of a shooter. To shoot from the 32nd floor down at concert few blocks away, middle of the night, loud concert, people moving around, noise effects, light effects, wind, etc. and to do what the shooter did. And to have only one piece of napkin for notes. Someone in the military would be capable of doing all of this and illegally assembling weapons. The security guard disappeared from his scheduled news conference on &quot;Hannity&quot; and then somehow the shooters house in Reno got robbed. You would think the biggest mass shooting in U.S. history during an investigation they would be protecting the shooters house and have tabs on the security guard, but no. (Maybe the security guard robbed the shooters house because evidence was in the house) Furthermore, MGM &amp; Las Vegas PD keep changing timelines. MGM might know all of the above and are saving their own butts by not releasing too much information. We don&#39;t even know what day he checked in and it&#39;s been more then week since the shooting. From my hotel experience, it takes 20 seconds to look that up. MGM doesn&#39;t want a massive lawsuit from every concertgoer, people staying in hotel, etc. Would hurt MGM brand. Maybe they know something small or big who knows. Also, for the shooter to kill himself before the cops even got their. And for the shooter to only shoot the security guard and not kill him. Makes me wonder, was the security guard the 2nd shooter, and did something happened during the shooting where the shooter shot the security guard and the security guard killed the shooter. MGM has to know more, there would be footage of him getting checked in, did he have bellman help with his bags upon checkin, if he did maybe the bellman were in on it because it takes many bags for that many guns, did he come in a taxi-Uber, interview the driver. Where is all the camera footage?
I mean none of this could be true or all of it. I could add way more to this and some other theory&#39;s make sense. But all in all this case doesn&#39;t make sense and someone is lying. Thoughts? </p>

<p>(Sorry for not using names but I refuse to acknowledge the shooter) </p>

<p>Pretty sure that&#39;s not a universal rule though. </p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If you watched today&#39;s press briefing, the sheriff said the security had and used both. &quot;Mr. Campos received his wounds in close proximity to 22:05. He attempted to relay that information via his radio. And it was confirmed because he also relayed that information via his cell phone. So the timeline associated to both of those sources have been verified.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, the fact the shooter had access to the service elevator is strange. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ehh, rich people get all kinds of special perks. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Side note, the security guard is an armed guard as well </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you have any evidence of this? Because from what the hotel said, it sounds like he&#39;s not. </p>

<blockquote>

And to have only one piece of napkin for notes. Someone in the military would be capable of doing all of this and illegally assembling weapons. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How did you jump from him being an armed guard to him having military training? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The security guard disappeared from his scheduled news conference on &quot;Hannity&quot; and then somehow the shooters house in Reno got robbed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He allegedly skipped out on the interviews last night (Thursday) and Paddock&#39;s house was broken into last weekend. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You would think the biggest mass shooting in U.S. history during an investigation they would be protecting the shooters house </p>
</blockquote>

<p>See: San Bernardino shooter&#39;s house fiasco. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and have tabs on the security guard, but no. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you know they didn&#39;t have tabs on the security guard? There&#39;s been an armed guard outside of his house for at least a few days now. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Maybe the security guard robbed the shooters house because evidence was in the house) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They said nothing important was taken (although they could be lying). My money is on it being a crazed conspiracy theorist or tenacious journalist (Laura Loomer?) who broke in looking for clues. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, MGM &amp; Las Vegas PD keep changing timelines. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you rewatch all the press conferences, the timeline really hasn&#39;t changed very much. The media is blowing it out of proportion. I do find the sudden addition of the maintenance worker to be extremely odd though. </p>

But I&#39;ve also heard Campos worked for the concerts security not the hotel. Idk if that&#39;s true but I&#39;ve read it.
