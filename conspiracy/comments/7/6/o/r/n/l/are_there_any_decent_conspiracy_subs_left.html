<p>I just want the fun stuff back. Aliens, Mythology, Black Projects like Area 51, Project Bluebeam, Tesla&#39;s work that was taken and has not since been released, the illuminati, suppression of world changing information and the rest of the fucking myriad of interesting conspiracy topics out there that we could be discussing rather than the politics of a country that is on the brink of collapse...</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I speak for a lot of redditors that are not based in the US when I say: I do not give the slightest fuck about Trump, Clinton, Hollywood sex scandles that is being covered by every MSM branch in existance, your guns, or anything else that is specific to the US only. I want the real shit back and this was the best place to come in the past. Now it has turned to absolute shit and I don&#39;t see it returning to the way it was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t touch ATS anymore and haven&#39;t since around 2010 but from memory someone called Jared was a mass shooter, some other person who was an ex-marine got shot in a cabin after taking out people and that Norwegian killer Anders Breivik have all been shown to be killers who have posted there (To date).</p>

<p>Obviously Springer and the beardy poof with the pugs don&#39;t want people talking about <strong>genuine</strong> issues which they profit from but there are lots of mentally unstable people who use ATS to back up their deranged opinions and then go out and actualize them on people who are unaware of the context.</p>

<p>I spoke to a guy there once who thought that being a rape councilor/pastor was a great way to pick up chicks and didn&#39;t see anything wrong with it in the least. Lots of other people supported him on his assertion and he wasn&#39;t trolling or being &#39;edgy&#39;.</p>

<p>Lots of bad people go to ATS and lots of deranged people get manipulated by them.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t even access Google and so you&#39;re a step closer than I am to finding a credible source.</p>

<p>Best I could get using Bing was <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jared_Loughner">this link to Jared Loughner</a> which shows he went by the username erad3 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Lee_Loughner">the official wiki page for him</a>.</p>

<p>The rest is from memory but search ATS using my username here and you&#39;ll see that the admins there were happy to cover up their part in fueling killers with their shenanigans and silencing anyone who dare cause their purses to get lighter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m calling what I&#39;m seeing. I&#39;m seeing an influx of people who intentionally are anti-conspiracy and continuously strawmanning the entirety of what we do here. Reddit has been under NSA watch since the 2009 switch over to Amazon, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they&#39;re behind it. Then again it could just be <a href="/r/t_d">/r/t_d</a> or some other community that hates us. But it really seems like &quot;anti-conspiracy&quot; is a real popular thing in politics today. Not trying to make allegations, but who do you think is behind these troll accounts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So go create your own conspiracy sub. Unfortunately, there are a ton of bots/shills and has increased right with the LV shooting (whether you fucking care or not). </p>

<p>Also, unfortunately, the things you mention end up in conspiracy since MSM doesn&#39;t cover them. Conspiracy covers all, including US politics. Fuck, it is a US site. What the hell do you expect?</p>

<p>While I do sub to other spots to get non-political conspiracy type posts, I view this one as a catch-all for all conspiracy.</p>

<p>Sort posts in a different way, create your own posts, create your own sub or search on the topics you mentioned and you should be able to find another sub to check.</p>
