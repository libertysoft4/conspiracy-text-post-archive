        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It was a hoax. No one died. Police worked with crisis actors to fake death and injury and to incite panic among the real concert goers. Mandalay Bay, Jason Aldean, event security, police and hospital staff were in on it and instructed to treat it as a FEMA drill and issued a gag order. That&#39;s why they confiscated and wiped all phones and laptops of images.</p>

<p>There were no gunshots. Just a recording played on high-powered military grade hidden speakers at different locations. No bullets will ever be recovered from the crime because no bullets were fired. Paddock&#39;s room is a staged movie set. FBI leaked the photos on purpose to throw us nosy people off.</p>

<p>Why? 1. Gun control. 2. Liberty Act. 3. Practice for a possible real event in the future.  These hoaxes will continue until they achieve their legislative goals.</p>

<p>I&#39;m betting 10 totally real accounts are going to tell me they really honestly know someone who died.</p>

<p>I often wonder about the people who rigged the world trade center with demolition explosives. How would the elites even go about recruiting people for the task? How would the elites make sure these demolition crewman remain silent? How do they find people who will cooperate? </p>

<p>I know we can&#39;t say for sure, but I&#39;m just wondering what people speculate regarding this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are called assets, they are useful tools for the elite. The pawns really vary. There are Mk ultra victims, or sleepers who are specially trained and carry out important missions then conveniently lose all memory of it. While many others, most politicians are simply blackmailed, through whatever weaknesses the agenies can exploit why things like pizzagate exist. I just wanna tell you man, I think you are wrong about vegas. Your points are unsubstantiated, you really expect ppl to believe you, for what reasons. Yes sandy hook, 911 had elements that didnt add up. This too, Im not saying its not a conspiracy, Im just saying this is quite a claim, some evidence would be nice. I can follow your reasoning somewhat but am having a hard time with it. This fake stuff seems like a psy op to me. The illuminati elites love death, they love killing, they hate us. They love confusion and tainting conspiracys. I think this is just another example of them attempting t discredit conspirascies by creating multiple narratives, to try and make us look bad. ie flat earth</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True yeah I as trying to respond to both of u at once, sry if it got mixed. It&#39;s a tough question and one of the biggest reasons ppl have trouble believing conspiracies. I think the answer is divide and conquer. They compartmentalize everything, to the point where no one can see the bigger picture. They feed their own agencies disinformation and give them different reasons for doing what they do. So even if they somehow get busted, there is no links the them. Look into the word assets, as in CIA assets. They use many ppl who would have no link back to them. A good example is Laura Silsby and the new life children&#39;s refuge they got busted trying to smuggle children out of Haiti, with small links to Hillary Clinton. I&#39;m sure all of these ppl were assets, who knows what the agencies have on them, you&#39;d be surprised how low they will stoop </p>

In Sandy Hook, no one has seen photos of the dead, there was no video, and the &#39;crime scene&#39; was demolished with workers and gag orders. Not really the case here.</p>

<p>Just think Operation Northwoods, the government is okay with killing its own citizens. The FBI is literally a manufacturer of false flags.</p>

<p>I would think this would have too many moving parts to fake. Not because of keeping people quiet, but because you would need a massive amount of coordination to make it seem realistic.</p>
