<p><strong>Family Guy</strong></p>

<p><strong>Seth McFarlane</strong></p>

<p>Before I begin analyzing anything about Family Guy, I wanted to share that Seth McFarlane conveniently avoided his flight on 9/11 due to hangover:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnkEUS6sNI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWnkEUS6sNI</a></p>

<p>That seems reasonable enough, right? Honestly, though, despite his popularity, I never really did anything real research on him. I never actually thought about him. Where did he come from? How did he end up making something as big as Family Guy?</p>

<p>Digging into his history, I was surprised to see that he was an animator and writer for <em>Cow and Chicken</em>, <em>Johnny Bravo</em>, <em>Dexter’s Laboratory</em>, and many more classic and popular TV shows:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_MacFarlane">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_MacFarlane</a></p>

<p>I kept digging deeper. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design, one of the best design schools in the United States. Still, it was really, really hard to dig deeper than that. I could not find any information on how he was actually ‘discovered’, other than he went to a good school and he came from a wealth family.</p>

<p>So, all I can gather is that he grew up in a rich family, and he went to a rich school, and he worked hard, and he somehow got discovered, and now he’s famous. Oh, and he, avoided 9/11. Oh, and he’s a gay rights activist. That was noted several times in many articles.</p>

<p>Anyway, Family Guy has its funny moments, but when you really sit back and analyze it, there are some disturbing messages spread in the majority of the shows, and I wanted to discuss that in this post. This post may not be profound, but I feel the majority do not really think about the things they are watching. Humor can be a form of brainwashing -  a way to normalize certain extremes.</p>

<p><strong>Women</strong></p>

<p>I find it interesting that <em>feminists</em> speak out about a lot of things, but they never speak out against TV shows that degrade women consistently. I wanted to start with women because of all the current celebrity scandals going on right now regarding the abuse of women.</p>

<p>In the show, women are painted as consistently unintelligent and only valuable if beautiful. Lois sometimes breaks the mold, but never too much.</p>

<p>*For one, they idealize abortion consistently:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlP7n9Amakw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlP7n9Amakw</a></p>

<p>This show paints Lois as the “progressive liberal” – she is intelligent enough that many may be influenced by her views. In contrast, Peter is usually the stupid one, so Lois seems like the voice of reason. They use Lois to promote a certain feminist ideal. The writers do not seem to think women can think profoundly, but they sure tell women what to think.</p>

<p>*They degrade motherhood:</p>

<p>In one episode, Lois is changing Stewie’s diaper, and he is cussing her out. He says something along the lines of, “You’re proud of this? This is what you do with your life?” Lois’s maternal role is seen as lowly.</p>

<p>I can’t find that particular video now, but there are many episodes where Lois’s role as a housewife is degraded. I mean, much of the show has been centered around Stewie wanting to kill Lois simply because she is his mom.</p>

<p>*They Normalize Abuse of Women</p>

<p>This happens much in the show, but what greater example than how they treat Meg? Meg is consistently emotionally abused. In fact, every single episode seems to have at least one attack on Meg. </p>

<p>Whenever I watch shows centered around Meg, I truly grow saddened. She is shown as unworthy because she is not good looking (mostly that’s it). </p>

<p>There is so much more here, but the point is that it is all shown with humor. Seth McFarlane is sure concerned about LGBT equality, but he does not seem to care about how his TV show degrades women.</p>

<p>Let’s not forget Quagmire. His entire character centers around how he drugs and even rapes women. Where is the feminist outrage? Here is a scene where he drugs and rapes a woman:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pFU6zjGe8w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pFU6zjGe8w</a></p>

<p>How funny!</p>

<p>But Seth McFarlane is <em>so</em> outraged by Harvey Weinstein:</p>

<p><a href="http://ew.com/tv/2017/10/11/seth-macfarlane-harvey-weinstein-jessica-barth/">http://ew.com/tv/2017/10/11/seth-macfarlane-harvey-weinstein-jessica-barth/</a></p>

<p>Does anybody else see the contradiction? His entire TV show is devoted to degrading and mocking woman, yet he is just so emotional about Harvey Weinstein. If degrading women is done through humor, it’s ok, right?</p>

<p><strong>Christianity</strong></p>

<p>Family Guy hates Christianity. There are numerous episodes mocking Christianity. Whatever your religious beliefs, I feel it is important that anybody asks, <em>why</em>? Sure, they have the occasional quip about Islam, but there are not entire episodes devoted to the absurdity of Islam.</p>

<p>Here is an episode that mocks Jesus’s birth:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKS4VixzIj4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKS4VixzIj4</a></p>

<p>Here is in episode where they promote Richard Dawkin’s “God Delusion.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE5UkbZQYyM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE5UkbZQYyM</a></p>

<p>Remember just how popular this show is, and how easily manipulated people by celebrity endorsements.</p>

<p><em>Stay away from the church. In the battle over science vs. religion, science offers credible evidence for all the serious claims it makes. The church says, “Oh, it’s right here in this book, see? The one written by people who thought the sun was magic?” I for one would like to see some proof that there is a God. And if you say, “a baby’s smile,” I’m going to kick you right in the stomach. The &#39;Family&#39; guy commences to Harvard, Entertainment Weekly, 13 June 2006.</em></p>

<p><strong>Moral Relativism</strong></p>

<p>Even if you dismiss Christianity and religion, there is no doubt that Family Guy centers around extremism. It is my view that we become desensitized to extremism through comedy. I have written much about this in other posts (I linked at the bottom of this post).</p>

<p>The entire show centers around extremes in moral behavior. Interestingly, here is a clip where Peter explains that people are idiots if they take their values from tv shows in the first place:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2OdDl4jSIE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2OdDl4jSIE</a></p>

<p>While I agree with this clip to an extent, it is manipulative.
Yes, parents are absolutely responsible for what their children watch, but this clip is undermining the fact that television has a huge influence on adult minds as well.</p>

<p>Seth McFarlane can implant all of his political views through extreme humor, yet at the same time, he criticizes anybody who might be manipulated by the views of his show in the first place. It just seems like  a complete paradox. </p>

<p>It’s his way of justifying what he does, I suppose.</p>

<p>Either way, the show consistently paints morals as useless. I’m not even sure what clip to use for this. What is “good” and what is “bad” on Family Guy? If it gets a laugh, it seems to be okay.</p>

<p><em>“If something is shocking without being funny, it is hard to justify.” – Seth McFarlane</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Religion notoriously claims that they invented morality, they didn&#39;t. Morality exists in animals, ya know.”</em> Really?</p>

<p><strong>Nihilism</strong></p>

<p>Like many popular cartoons, nihilism is often promoted on Family Guy. Brian is an atheist, and he consistently promotes the view that nothing happens when we die:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeuqldbTluA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeuqldbTluA</a></p>

<p>We should “live in the moment” and not concern ourselves with anything else, right?</p>

<p>Brian seems to be a direct reflection of Seth – perhaps his alter ego. </p>

<p><strong>Humiliation</strong></p>

<p>The entire concept of humor in Family Guy centers around humiliation. As mentioned earlier, Meg is consistently abused and humiliated.</p>

<p>Here is the best of bullying Meg Griffin, seasons 1-6:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHhZ19_BJYU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHhZ19_BJYU</a></p>

<p>Besides Meg, every episode is centered around humiliating or degrading somebody or something. Here is a scene where Peter gets raped:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6Lsx5QBwW4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6Lsx5QBwW4</a></p>

<p>This is the tv show this generation and the upcoming generation are “growing up” with – the normalization of everything.</p>

<p><strong>Predictive Programming</strong></p>

<p>Like the Simpsons, Family Guy has been known to predict some strange, &quot;coincidental&quot; events. </p>

<p>Supposedly it predicted the Boston Marathon incident and Robin William’s death:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X289sq1pLk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X289sq1pLk</a></p>

<p>Creepily, Family Guy hinted that Bruce Jenner was a woman:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOwjCS8PBSM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOwjCS8PBSM</a></p>

<p>Did Family Guy predict Joan Rivers’s death?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SDjLQLnNc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0SDjLQLnNc</a></p>

<p>That one may be a little far-fetched, but you get the point.
Perhaps it is all just coincidence, or is there something more?</p>

<p><strong>Desensitization</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps children should not be watching this show, but should adults be watching it either? The entire show seems to be focused on creating the most extreme situation and getting us to laugh at it.</p>

<p>There is no subject that seems to be off limits in Family Guy. Ultimately, desensitization is normalization.</p>

<p>Here is my post on modern comedy and indoctrination if you are interested:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6nhupx/modern_comedy_and_indoctrination_how_humiliation/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6nhupx/modern_comedy_and_indoctrination_how_humiliation/</a></p>

<p>What is the next stage in humor? Can it become anymore depraved?</p>

<p>Maybe Seth McFarlane is innocent, and he is not purposely promoting anything. However, I highly doubt that. Even if he is not, somebody helped him and his show rise to insane popularity. The question is, as always, what are <em>they</em> trying to promote?</p>

<p>Again, this post is nothing profound, and that’s the problem. Because this type of humor is so normalized, nobody stops and thinks about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. McFarlane is obviously a senior player in Hollywood, because other than &quot;Family Guy,&quot; his stuff hasn&#39;t done all that great. &quot;American Dad&quot; has been a bubble show, and his movies have done poorly, the comedy western especially (which also seemed loaded with abuse victims like Doogie Howser and Charlize Theron). </p>

<p>You literally said in your own post he works on multiple cartoon&#39;s prior to creating his own? Why does he have to be discovered in an industry he was already working in? And is it that unbelievable to you that someone who was an animator and a writer on other cartoons would then go on to create his own? It&#39;s literally a time line of putting work in, first he went to art schools, then he worked for other shows, then he created his own, it&#39;s not like he was a dish washer at big boys that randomly created a hit show on his free time, it seems it&#39;s what he was working towards the entire time, He started at the bottom and worked his way up...... if you can&#39;t understand this I have no idea how to explain it then</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, you don&#39;t like a show so you&#39;re trying to argue that it is manipulating people, and all your arguments are literally &quot;this show takes shot at my moral compass and that hurts my feelings&quot;, Maybe christians don&#39;t realize they are being manipulated to be offended by everything......</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of fuckery with Family Guy -- regularly called out on this sub:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=family+guy">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=family+guy</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s also the humiliation aspect of reducing female sex-symbol <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;amp;biw=1536&amp;amp;bih=732&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=mila+kunis+body">Mila Kunis</a> into a character (Meg) that&#39;s routinely farted on. I used to find this casting choice deliciously ironic, but now I find it sad. And with the Weinstein scandal fresh in mind... well... I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she had to do a few things to land the role.</p>

<p>I used to love these adult humor cartoons -- Family Guy, South Park, Simpsons, Robot Chicken. And I had become quite adept at that edgy/smart brand of humor -- a big hit within American culture, great for entertaining friends.</p>

<p>I got a big wakeup call when I was visiting a former Soviet country and made some silly joke about tossing a crying baby out of a window to solve the problem or some such... I didn&#39;t get slapped, quite, but it did not go over well. Made me aware of the degradation effect that this off-color -- yet &quot;normal&quot; -- American humor has on our psyches, especially on children.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I proceeded to cut Family Guy, South Park, Simpsons, etc. out of my YouTube feed -- even clicking the &quot;Not Interested&quot; link and completing the &quot;Tell us why&quot; mini-survey. Several years later, and they&#39;re still sneaking their way into my feed. I&#39;m finding it deceptively difficult to cut these influences out of my life.</p>

<p>Anyhow, thanks for another great post, <a href="/u/polkadotgirl">/u/polkadotgirl</a>!</p>
