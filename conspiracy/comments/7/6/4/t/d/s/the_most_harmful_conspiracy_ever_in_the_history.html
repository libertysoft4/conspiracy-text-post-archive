        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Food Pyramid.  Ever hear of it?  Of course you have.  It taught us that a diet consisting of mostly carbohydrates and low fat is healthy.  That we would live longer with less health problems.</p>

<p>Why did they do this?  Why did they flat out lie or at the least, push an agenda that they had no idea about?</p>

<p>Money.  It&#39;s always money.</p>

<p>Back in the early 1900&#39;s, farmers had huge sway in governments.  It was literally the &quot;Bread and Butter&quot; of political influence.  They paid off the USDA to push the &quot;grains are healthy and too much fats are bad&quot; narrative.    It seemed to work back then because there were hardly any processed food.  </p>

<p>And then the real bad guy &quot;High Fructose Corn Syrup&quot; was invented in 1957 and everything went to hell.  It was put in to virtually everything we consume and everyone started noticing that people&#39;s health was declining.  Sure we were living longer due to medical advances, but obesity was rising at an alarming pace and is now an epidemic.  </p>

<p>Research now shows that diets high in fat and low in carbs is the real healthy diet.  Literally the complete opposite of USDA guidelines.  But why are people still unaware of this?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a conspiracy.  The USDA was created by and for grain growers.  High Fructose Corn Syrup makes so much money in any given year that they are able to squash any kind of information getting out.  And yet, people believe that farm subsidies are still necessary.  All the while, Americans suffer from ever growing waist lines.  </p>

<p>P.S.  The small farmers are not responsible for this and I support subsides for them.  It&#39;s the mega-rich agricultural corporations who process these foods that are the ones in power now.  It is them we have to investigate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>fat sticks to and blocks the functuons of your arteries and organs.  The REAL answer is a plant based diet.  We arent omnivores like your led to believe.  its about huy bacteria and how they operate within the eco-system that is us.  Id tou eat meat, your cultivating the wrong types of gut bacteria which keads to inflammation of all kinds.  This in turn leads to disease due to your immune system being weakened.  Plant based diets are much healthier for you because they foster the best bacteria in our gut and there are so many nutrients in plants especially when combined.  Dairy is also bad because it is made with the hormonal juices from another species.  You cant drink it and expect to not have any side effect.  Yogurt has even been shown to increase the risk of death of breast cancer by 50%. There are many reasons you shouldnt eat meat and pushing the keto diet is just stupid because not inly are you hurting people your advocating the slaughter of.more animals to suit your dietary needs.  It should be a treat, if anything, to eat meat.  It shouldnt be the every meal staple it is now. We have no reason to kill animals, nutrition just doesnt depend on eating meat.  </p>

Minimal meat needs to be consumed to survive, but bottom line is you need to eat was grows around you. A African shouldn&#39;t have a diet high in Canadian beaver.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you cured your fathers cancer but it was likely because he cut out all processed foods rather than whether he was eating meat or eating plants. I eat both and I&#39;m doing fine. I do agree that if you are from Africa you should probably be eating things native to Africa because it just makes sense BUT that&#39;s not really what we are talking about + I&#39;m pretty sure cows and salmon as well as fruits and veggies are native enough to USA. I will look into that diet bc I always love learning new stuff </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things didn&#39;t really get out of hand until after WW2 when corn production spiked hard though. Big agricultural interests where already corrupting things before the mid 40&#39;s, but it got really bad around then.

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly. A big part of the economics had to do with nitrogen based weapons plants realizing they could develop nitrogen fertilizer and corn is a particularly responsive crop to nitrogen fertilizers. The weapons plants literally shifted to making fertilizer for subsidized corn and the surplus of corn gave rise to hfcs and other junk food that undercut other foods on price. That&#39;s the out in the open version at least.</p>

<p>Of course, once you get into the realm of insidious conspiracies to sicken the populace from the shadows you end up in all sorts of wild places, but even just the surface level stuff wrt food is pretty damning even without bringing in the more elaborate narratives featuring illuminati/nazi/whatever stuff.</p>

<p>Keto and its entire movement is industrial funded by animal agriculture</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keto is fought and discredited by nearly everyone in the food industry. Not to mention, a real keto diet consists of very moderate levels of protein. The belief that &quot;you just eat all meat&quot; is keto is completely inaccurate. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>no nutritional science behind it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just laughably ignorant. A simple Duckduckgo search will provide you with a substantial amount of scientific studies showing the benefits of a ketogenic diet. And any &quot;major study&quot; cited by the MSM about why keto is unhealthy is based on shitty scientific practices and doesn&#39;t account for key variables that make all the difference (like allowing for subjects to let their bodies become keto-adapted before beginning a study). There&#39;s a really interesting book called Keto Clarity if you&#39;re interested on the good and bad science around ketogenic diets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your looking for an alternative food pyramid, a plant based diet is MUCH healthier in every regard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While a plant based diet is certainly a better option than the modern food pyramid, claiming that it&#39;s &quot;MUCH healthier in every regard&quot; is untrue. There are a lot of key vitamins and amino acids that you get from animal proteins that can be EXTREMELY difficult to incorporate into an all plant based diet (while not impossible, many people who are vegetarian or vegan do not go the extra lengths required to truly have a well balanced diet).</p>

<p>Not saying that you are, but it sure sounds like you&#39;re buying into the vegan communities propaganda a little too hard. Just like that stupid &quot;What the Health&quot; movie on Netflix, straight up propaganda.</p>

<p>If you have just been listening to the vegan community tell you about ketogenic diets, I highly recommend that you do some research on your own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I researched it for a few months &amp; went Kito for a year, I had to take more supplements of a keto diet than I did a plant based one.. Sodium potassium and magnesium need to be integrated daily on a KETO diet and a little after hitting the year mark I was getting terrible muscle cramps, but being sold on the diet I ignored them until I went to the doctor and was told I had renal tubular acidosis, one of the common side effects of the diet... Keto fucked me up and it took about half a year before my body and gym gains got back on track because of it. I could never suggest it to ANYONE personally, which Is why spoke up.

    <div class="md"><p>There is no &quot;placebo&quot;, you either follow the diet correctly and take the proper precautions or you don&#39;t and you run into certain complications. Clearly, there was a lot more research needed on your end to maintain your body at its correct levels. There is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach with this diet and it takes dedication, knowledge, and maintenance.</p>

<p>What the keto diet is definitely not about is being &quot;sold&quot; and then ignoring your body. You had the freedom to change your macros and take less of an extreme approach, you had the ability to experiment with supplementation and max carb intake levels, but instead of taking responsibility for the possibility that you weren&#39;t ready and properly maintaining your body and diet, you blame Keto.</p>

<p>Basically, what you&#39;re sharing with us is that you didn&#39;t maintain your car correctly and you&#39;re shocked that it&#39;s not working properly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All good thanks for the reply. For a year I didn&#39;t supplement everything was fine. Followed the diet by the book. Felt good until right around the year mark, started getting really bad muscle cramps, started researching if the diet could be the issue. Found that it was a common issues, learned about the daily supplements everyone SHOULD be taking on the diet, thought that was the issue. Kept ignoring the cramps started taking supplements, after a few months of no change, developed more issues and the nutritionist very quickly told me my diet was likely the key cause for the tubular acidosis, as it is a common side effect. Switch up the diet within a week or two the muscle cramps went away. I certainly tried everything I could on the diet, &amp; enjoyed it for about a year before things went south. Happy to hear if its working for others, I just can&#39;t with an honest heart personally recommend it.</p>

<p>I did a high sugar diet for a month consisting of around 80% carbs mostly coming from candy and fruit with very little fat and rest protein. (I lost 8lbs that month but was also heavier when I did this one).</p>

<p>Wow. <em>I&#39;m</em> sorry that you literally have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. </p>

<p>I get it. Calories in/calories out sounds like it makes sense, because it&#39;s intuitive, it&#39;s simple. Guess what? The human metabolism is <strong>far from simple</strong>. Look up the metabolism of fructose vs glucose. Both carbohydrates by definition, yet with wildly different results in metabolism. See how something seemingly intuitive gets all wrong? </p>

<p>You want to find studies disproving CICO? Here&#39;s an easy to understand NYTimes (oh no!) article reporting on a Harvard study I can&#39;t get to at the moment: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/health/19brody.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/health/19brody.html</a></p>

<p>Seeing as you&#39;ll likely ignore the chemical jargon of any published work (or even Wikipedia for that matter), I&#39;ll link you to a lecture by a professor of endocrinology at UCSF detailing how vastly different carbohydrates are metabolized in the human body and their effects. If you can watch and understand it, and yet <strong>still</strong> believe that the type of macronutrient doesn&#39;t matter, you&#39;re lost.</p>

<p>I already said that yes keto works. There’s also an EXTREMELY small amount of ATHLETES who use keto in any effective manner. An large example being PALEO falling to the wayside in the crossfit community, which is generally a very low carb diet.</p>

<p>You’ve provided little to no evidence that it’s a fucking conspiracy. The only thing that’s been shown is the dairy industry being pushed by gov since it’s subsidized. </p>

<p>A ketogenic diet improves brain and cardio-vascular health, nowhere is anyone calling carbs bad.</p>

<p>I am responding to this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And the fact that solid science exists and has shown that the overabundance of the simple sugars in carbs have negative effects on health.</p>

<p>Even in someone doing high intensity cardio, lifting, and eating at a caloric deficit, simple sugars are a negative when compared to the alternative fuel, fat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok in that case my bad. I actually cant really tell on my phone currently. The fact is when studies usually conclude something its usually from the a sense of something else. For instance, high sugar diets are no good for obvious reasons. But at the same time, lack of fiber plays huge role when combined with sugars. Usually people main health problems are a lack of fiber, water, sufficient protein and healthy fats. After experimenting for years, I found a balanced diet with more health conscious foods that take up about 70-80% of the entire diet was best. Lifes to short not to be able to fit in even sugary foods such as cookies or icecream. Theres a middle ground for everyone depending on their life style. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did an 80% vegan plant based diet for over a year with daily juicing (mostly dark greens) and it exacerbated my prediabetes and physical pain. Dr was trying to prescribe medication.</p>

<p>One month on keto (which I protested heavily before I tried it myself because I LOVED CARBS and could not imagine a life without them) and I felt so good I literally could never eat a carb again. Mentally and physically, wonderful. I had very healthy blood test results after 6 months, I lost over 20 lbs and looked good, when I was never overweight to begin with. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t had a flu or cold in a year whereas I usually have one every few months and I shaved 1:30 off my mile. I quit recreational drinking after about 6 months also because I just feel so good every day that ingesting something that makes me feel bad just seems stupid.</p>

<p>All while feeling mentally clear and stable in mood. </p>

<p>If a study came out that said I would most definitely die 10 years earlier from keto, but I get to feel this good and energetic and pain free every day I think I&#39;d go with the keto.</p>

I tried to offset the absence of carbs with more protein and fat but it was difficult because I don&#39;t care for meat.

How would a keto diet be effective for an athlete? Glucose is the most efficient method of using energy in the body especially when it comes to athletics. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to <em>intake</em> carbs to create glucose. Your body can create glycogen(5 glucose molecules) from other carbon substrates using a process called gluconeogenesis.</p>

<p>This process is favored by the brain and cardio-vascular system for some reason we don&#39;t really have a good explanation for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vegan is ideal as well. It&#39;s not meat vs veggies, that&#39;s a moral argument, but as far as health, a diet with meat and veggies or a diet with veggies and beans etc is just as healthy for you. </p>

<p>The problem with meat diets in the US is you are ingesting shitloads of hormones, steroids and antibiotics. It&#39;s unrealistic that most people currently are close to local free range farms or can shoot their own deer meat, but the meat in the grocery store is poison. </p>

<p>You will put on muscle, you will feel a million times better than a high carb diet, but you are still fucking with your hormones and cells. </p>

<p>If you switched to game meat only from a grocery store paleo diet you will feel superhuman. A chicken breast shouldn&#39;t be the size of your head, that&#39;s filled with nasty stuff. </p>

<p>I went to see him after finding out my testosterone levels are very low, well below even the &quot;low&quot; threshold number and I&#39;m not even 30. I told him I&#39;ve had such low energy and fatigue for years now and it&#39;s ruined so many things in my life. He acted as if it&#39;s not an issue. He said I most likely have sleep apnea instead (I don&#39;t even snore) and to focus on a Mediterranean diet. He tried to cell me on purely CICO. What the fuck.   I&#39;ve been reading papers, anything I could get on my hands on about ketosis and none of this &quot;fat is bad&quot; narrative makes any sense to me at this point.

    <div class="md"><p>Then why are you making fun of the OP and not attacking the corn lobby/sugar lobby that currently IS subsidized? Why are you not attacking the laws that allow corporations to write off income and subsidize people&#39;s hobbies (professional sports)?  Libertarians in the US are pretty strange. They don&#39;t seem to understand the way the power structure works and often attack the wrong targets. Though it is easier to make fun of people than actually enact change against the entrenched corporate interests that are currently subsidized by our system. </p>

<p>Can you share diet recommendations? Specifically what you think is best for macros and what type(s) of foods would be best for someone who wants to maintain weight or gain weight like bodybuilders. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not fond of keto/paleo or any specific diet. I just try to research objectively and find whatever foods offer the best health benefits. But as you know, this is a big rabbit hole and there&#39;s so much information out there it&#39;s tough to draw conclusions.</p>

<p>We can both agree plants and greens are a huge necessity for good heath. But you can&#39;t lift weights &amp; try to consume 3500 calories/day just eating broccoli and kale and green beans. </p>

<p>Starting from the premise that we need to eat A LOT more greens... what other foods do you think should be consumed to create the &quot;best&quot; health-focused diet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So are fruit sugars bad for you too? Seriously, what kind of keto circle jerk did I just walk into? There is no healthier diet for people AND than planet than a plant-based diet. Do you guys think meat grows like plants? We don&#39;t have the resources to feed the world meat, much less meat that requires land, water and destroys our atmosphere with its methane gasses. For a group of people who have sooo many theories about conspiracies with little evidence its really sad to see that there is tons of evidence on the proper diet, yet many go complete cognitive dissonance. Meat is not sustainable. It doesn&#39;t matter if you think its healthy or not or if your friends buddy went keto and his cancer went away, its not sustainable for the planet. Please downvote me if you need to, it really only validates how little people want to change.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree, I think meat is a bad thing to eat and I used to eat it, but it destroys the environment, the animals are treated so appallingly you&#39;re basically eating sadness when you eat meat, and things like berries and nuts and avocados and eggs (from your own happy chickens) are hopefully ok to live off. Berries particularly are good. I felt so amazing when I ate lots of berries for a week. Apparently it&#39;s something called polyphenols in them.</p>

But spouting bullshit left and right like it&#39;s the only way to be healthy is where they lose whatever argument they had. A nutritional balance destroys keto and any diet. What&#39;s funny is they usually don&#39;t have any studies to support what they&#39;re saying. I&#39;ve read the studies. Keto should be strictly preference.</p>

Combined with store sales you can find cheese for like a dollar a pound ... they&#39;re definitely trying to get us to buy more dairy.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing is the WIC nutritional program is almost entirely dairy/grain based.

<blockquote>
<p>Research now shows that diets high in fat and low in carbs is the real healthy diet. Literally the complete opposite of USDA guidelines. But why are people still unaware of this? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That part is incorrect. (And I notice no cite.) Raw, high <em>simple</em> carbs, low fat is the ideal diet -- put simply, raw fruit and dark leafy greens, as that&#39;s what the pre-tool, tropical human body was designed for and thrived on for millions of years before the invention of fire. Although I&#39;d say some <em>minor</em> adjustment is necessary, depending on heredity, as we&#39;ve been pretty far from the ideal diet for thousands of years now.</p>

<p>More info here: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/80-10-Diet-Balancing-Luscious-ebook/dp/B00I0UM8UC">https://www.amazon.com/80-10-Diet-Balancing-Luscious-ebook/dp/B00I0UM8UC</a></p>

<p>Also probably important to mention that animal products and the food pyramid greatly increase risk of cancer, heart disease, diabetes -- i.e., money for the medical industry and control for politics.</p>

Without glucose as a source for energy, the body will produce Ketones that uses fat directly as a source for energy.  In short, it&#39;s eating the bread WITH butter that is very bad for you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great question.  It is because the crop industry vastly outperforms livestock industry in the US.  Remember, corn is not only used as a grain/vegetable, but also to make Ethanol and, the king of all cash product, high fructose corn syrup.  </p>

<p>But that is only half the story.  Remember, the enemy, as reinforced over and over again by the govt, is fat.  But notice how they don&#39;t attack protein?  Because meat is mostly protein and a bit of fat.  Simply trim the fat and use it elsewhere, and nothing goes to waste.  Overall, the benefit of pushing sugars as good and fats as bad is much more profitable than the other way around.</p>

<p>For anecdotal research I have done a few studies on myself. A McDonalds/fast diet for a month, (I lost 6.5lbs, was in a 500-700 caloric deficit daily)</p>

<p>I did a high sugar diet for a month consisting of around 80% carbs mostly coming from candy and fruit with very little fat and rest protein. (I lost 8lbs that month but was also heavier when I did this one).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope I&#39;m not coming off as condescending because that&#39;s my intent. What I&#39;m wondering is, so in my situation, I&#39;m an active powerlifter who consumes 400+ grams of carbs a day to gain weight and strength and staying at a caloric surplus. How would a keto diet be effective for an athlete? Glucose is the most efficient method of using energy in the body especially when it comes to athletics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to see some sense in this thread, all the keto-loving up top was scary. We&#39;re in the conspiracy subreddit and yet one of the biggest conspiracies of them all is in regards to the meat industry, and how bad it is for the people and the planet. Noone wants to know if it affects what they eat. I&#39;d really recommend documentaries like Cowspiracy if anyone is interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>None of these &quot;sources&quot; point out why carbs are bad. The first study promotes ketones which more likely summarizes preference as I have pointed out already. Never did I state carbs are essential to the human body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quit beating up a strawman.</p>

<p>A ketogenic diet improves brain and cardio-vascular health, nowhere is anyone calling carbs bad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second isn&#39;t even a study, not to mention its core point is about added sugars. Are you serious? Yea lets throw in a bunch of links unrelated to what we&#39;re saying to fuel our bullshit arguments. I mean that&#39;s what you did here. Theres a big difference between getting your carbohydrate sources from soda rather than a potato.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This.. actually makes me think you were in a discussion with someone else about a different aspect of sugar-carb. I&#39;m arguing against sugar, not carbs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because none of your links contradict what I&#39;ve said in this thread</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am responding to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the carb scare is retarded and has no scientific basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the fact that solid science exists and has shown that the overabundance of the simple sugars in carbs have negative effects on health.</p>

<p>Even in someone doing high intensity cardio, lifting, and eating at a caloric deficit, simple sugars are a negative when compared to the alternative fuel, fat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is NOTHING good about fructose. It should be considered an anti-nutrient.  Fructose is ONLY metabolized by the liver and is highly linked to fatty liver, visceral fat and metabolic syndrome. Yeah, that&#39;s &quot;fruit sugars&quot;. </p>
