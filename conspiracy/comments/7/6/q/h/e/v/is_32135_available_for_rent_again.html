    <div class="md"><p>I still don&#39;t buy the &quot;heightened awareness&quot; after the fact...</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the gorcery store where the manager and stockboy are keeping an eye out for the odd shoplifter.  This is an entire subset of the Madalaya staff dedicated to security and only security.  Just by virtue of their business, they are a magnet for crime.</p>

<p>Sure, I&#39;ll admit that they could have gotten complacent without recent events to keep them frosty, but their entire function is to remain vigilant 24/7.  It is unlikely that they are doing anything now that they should have been doing before the event - except evicting guests; things that don&#39;t increase security, but serve to cover their ass.  Especially in light of recent (supposed) active shooter training and the addition of firearm prohibiting placards.</p>

<p>What should they have noticed?  A lone guest requesting an entire suite the size of a single family home and then requesting an ajoining room.  A unauthorized guest in the service elevator.  A lone guest (supposedly without baggage) bringing baggage in unrelated to check-in, in excess of what a lone guest should typically need - while refusing bell service (again, supposedly).  They should have noticed a guest services cart parked in the hallway of the luxury hotel for an extended period of time.  The entire week, housekeeping never entererd the room?  Maybe while being preoccupied by executing the operation, they could noticed his gambling habits as lackadaisical.</p>

<p>I install surveillance and access control equipment... I advise and consult with the operators of the systems I install.  They <em>could</em> have noticed his demeanor... The list of what they could have noticed is nearly endless.  Remember... They are not watching monitors for entertainment.  Everyone is a potential perp and they are contantly applying that filter to what they see.  It&#39;s how it&#39;s done. </p>

<p>Paddock was a big guy and would have stuck out on camera as very noticible.</p>

<p>The red flags are numerous and blatant and do not require vigilance inspired after the fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever stayed in a hotel? Nothing he did prior to the shooting would have raised eyebrows. Lots of guests don&#39;t let housekeeping in the room--many hotels are encouraging this trend, to save money. Marriott Courtyards have an opt-in program that gives guests extra reward points if they waive housekeeping. Even using the service elevator isn&#39;t that odd, depending on the property. I once used the service elevator at a Club Quarters for the duration of my stay because it was closer to my room than the guests&#39; elevator bank--the hotel doesn&#39;t care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dismissive...</p>

<p>Yes... I&#39;ve stayed in hotels. (?)</p>

<p>A luxury hotel, one of the biggest suites they have, housekeeping blocked for the entire week, or even just a few days?  Red flag.  Housekeeping will eventually demand entry, siting fresh towels or soap, just so they can confirm the condition of the property.  This is standard stuff that a guest doesn&#39;t normally consider, because they don&#39;t normally trash the hotel rooms.</p>

<p>A luxury hotel does not like to display the less appealing underbelly of their day-to-day workings.  Freight elevator, especially if used through out the week, is definitely a red flag, and even poses a liability to the hotel that should have caught someone&#39;s concern.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I once used the service elevator...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once... Pft.  And you fail to observe that at Mandalay Bay, the service elevator is at the FAR OPPOSITE end of the facility.  Hardly any manner of convenience involved.  But definitely more secretive.</p>

<p>Any one occurance should not have raised any strong concern, but with the ability to watch and see Paddock throughout the entire week and miss <em>everything</em> is inexcusable.</p>

<p>Seriously... You&#39;re just a dolt on the outside looking in and you&#39;re completely dismissive.  You don&#39;t seem to be exercising any scrutiny.  You&#39;re not looking beyond your nose.  You&#39;re not putting yourself into the security personnel&#39;s position and mindset.</p>

<p>I install surveillance and access control.  I&#39;m not even a &quot;guard&quot; and I immediately adopted the vigilant mindset on the job.  In this field, eventually you see who actual perpetrators are and you realize it could be literally ANYONE.  You then see things a little differently...  Things YOU would dismiss.</p>

<p>Talk to a cop... They see nearly every one and every situation differently than you do.  You&#39;re only dismissing things that YOU don&#39;t think should be of concern.</p>

<p>The &quot;failed security&quot; at Mandalay Bay is of big concern on many fronts.  Things like this must be theorized about or they will simply fall through the cracks.  Anwers will never be known if questions are not posed and asked.  People like you seem hell bent on thwarting discussion that considers this important aspect with silly little dismissive arguments...</p>

<p>If it were up to you, everything is normal.  Mandalay Bay should probably receive an award and investigators should look elsewhere to determine how this was executed without any opposition.</p>

<p>You felt the need to faceciously ask me if I ever stayed in a hotel, so I&#39;ll ask you: have you ever designed and installed a complete facility surveillance and intergrated access control system and then trained the security staff on it&#39;s operation and capabilities?  Ever implement a service contract for these related systems for one of the largest health care providers on the east coast?  Ever monitor a three-state-wide surveillance system for an energy company nearly constantly under terrorist watch status?</p>

<p>Your little &quot;I used a service elevator once&quot; anecdote was cute, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re inventing red flags so that you can freak out about them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a consultant, I&#39;ve spent 5 consecutive days in many hotels, almost always without housekeeping (I don&#39;t like people messing with my stuff). The hotel sometimes calls to make sure I don&#39;t want housekeeping, but usually just slips a note under the door. Security never gives a damn--they have my ID and credit card on file if I were to do any damage.</p>

<p>Same with the service elevator. No one would notice that he were using it, or care. They might politely ask him to stop, but it&#39;s not a security issue. If the elevator isn&#39;t locked, guests are going to use it sometimes. Especially in a property that size.</p>

<p>This is why people don&#39;t take r/conspiracy ponderings seriously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again... You are simply being dismissive.  You&#39;re just shrugging off improtant aspects that should be investigated in full.  I never said, &quot;This is how he did it&quot;.  More importantly my point is, these things need to be determined without any doubts.</p>

<p>Nobody is freaking out about anything.  I&#39;m merely stating that these are important avenues that must be explored.  In such an investigation, with so many open ends, you would leave nothing to chance.  I can&#39;t figure why you&#39;d work so hard to the opposite.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not using an investigative mindset at all...  It&#39;s like you don&#39;t even belong here.</p>

<p>I gaurantee you, without any doubt, that after you refuse and refuse housekeeping, they are checking the room when you are out. (I also have family in the hospitality sector...)</p>

<p>People don&#39;t take r/conspiracy seriously because of people plodding through here with the mindset of a fat dumb housewife, instead of taking someone seriously, who really wants to get answers to questions that might be difficult or unpleasant to ask.</p>

<p>You&#39;re a complete contrarian without anything to support what you say.  It&#39;s all &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; and anecdotal bullshit about what you THINK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whew... You are a consultant, aren&#39;t you?  I can tell, because you just don&#39;t fucking get it.</p>

<p>I never speculated!  I never proffered any theories, really, except that the security situation needs to be wrung out in full.</p>

<p>Without even thinking like an investigator, hotel security is the most obvious place for the entire investigation to begin!  There is surveillance footage to review, security staff to inview, housekeeping to interview... All in an effort to retrace Paddock&#39;s steps at the hotel.  But yet, in the information relayed to the public, this aspect seems to have the most glaring holes in it.</p>

<p>So what the fuck is wrong with asking these questions?  Why does that upset you so much?  Look how much time you&#39;ve invest in <strong>ME</strong>, for what?  All because something I typed put sand in your vagina.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already pegged you as a dismissive contrarian, but I&#39;m quickly arriving at the conclusion that you&#39;re not much more than an astounding asshole!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand me through and through.  I&#39;m not the least bit upset.  Don&#39;t let emphasis and exclamations mislead you - they are just there to nail down points that you so roundly dismiss out of hand.</p>

<p>You seem to think I&#39;m making assumptions.  Posing questions is not making assumptions.  And not every question has a question mark at the end of it... These are theories to be explored.  I never proffered anything as fact.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more astounded by how anyone could be so dismissive and contrary, when all you have is your opinion which isn&#39;t worth more than anyone else&#39;s.  We ALL have to admit in the end that none of us really know, and likely we never will.</p>

<p>But here, it is our duty to question.  If you can dispell with facts, then so be it, but pure opinion to the contrary doesn&#39;t cut it... I don&#39;t think any of us are here to actually solve anything.  Rather, we&#39;re here to ask and consider and hopefully understand.</p>

<p>If we were running the investigation... I would have explored all these avenues and maybe came up empty.  HOPEFULLY, I&#39;d come up emptry so we don&#39;t have to implicate the staff.</p>

<p>However, based on your replies, you&#39;d just dismiss all this speculation and you&#39;d never know... You never find the answers to question you don&#39;t ask.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find that a little concerning... Much like shipping all the 9/11 debris to &quot;Fesh Kills&quot; landfill and selling the steel for scrap before any effective investigation can be conducted.</p>

<p>You&#39;d think the FBI would be sitting on that crime scene for a while.  This was a MASS fucking MURDER!  Every surface in that room and nearby in the hallway should have been dusted from prints.  Every blood spatter should have been sampled and sent to labs.</p>

<p>The FBI would have no concern for how quickly MGM is able to turn around that room.  The investigation should have taken all priority.  That crime scene should have remained intact until hard conclusions where reached.  But obviously, they opted bury the scene.</p>
