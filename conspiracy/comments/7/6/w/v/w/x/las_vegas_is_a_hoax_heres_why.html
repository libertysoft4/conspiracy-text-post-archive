<p>Here&#39;s some crisis actors talking about their injuries. It&#39;s heavily edited to make a point but you can find the original interviews if you&#39;re determined: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dQ17_LWFZs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dQ17_LWFZs</a>

<p>Isn&#39;t it suspicious that they all claim they can&#39;t remove the lead bullet lodged in their body?</p>

<p>Speaking of bullets, where are they? Why haven&#39;t anyone recovered a single bullet from the grounds, the injured, or the dead?</p>

<p>Be skeptical of users here who say they know someone who died in Vegas.  There are 500K subscribers here (many of whom are not Americans and most of them inactive) which is 0.17% of the US population. Isn&#39;t it amazing how so many people in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> know someone who loves country music and happen to be in Vegas on Oct 1. and is actually one of the 58 in a crowd of 22,000.
These people who claim to know someone who died in Vegas are deliberately manipulating your emotions and they are helping the deep state instill fear and submissiveness on the population.</p>

<p>If one of them gives you the guilt trip when you bring up the possibility of a hoax, give them the American salute: <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/10/02/man-giving-las-vegas-shooter-middle-finger-becomes-symbol-of-american-spirit-6972132/">http://metro.co.uk/2017/10/02/man-giving-las-vegas-shooter-middle-finger-becomes-symbol-of-american-spirit-6972132/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because you don&#39;t know anyone who was affected by(killed/injured), it doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t happen. I know people who were shot and injured at the concert. Someone I personally know for over 10+ years) went with his wife and mother in law. The mother in law was shot, taken to the hospital, and had to be rushed into surgery. She didn&#39;t die but was injured. So people WERE IN FACT targeted, shot, and or killed. But who did it? Why? THAT is what the conspiracy is. </p>

<p>I get that you&#39;re doubtful. Who wouldn&#39;t be honestly. Our govt lies about everything, but THIS one isn&#39;t the hoax. Hell, I believe they hoaxed some other terror attacks, fake victims and all. But this isn&#39;t the one. If you follow occult stuff and that aspect of it, you can understand why a mass killing like this happened when and where it did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your theory goes that the shooting never happened. </p>

<p>First option is that all people at Mandalay Bay where crisis actors. Everyone. The videos where you can clearly hear bullets flying past the cameras, echos, are all fabricated and edited material. Tons of work that has to be accurate. It is possible, but it would take time. A lot of it. Since these videos were uploaded right after the event, they should have started making the fake evidences long before the event, without anyone noticing it.</p>

<p>Second option is that some actors were in the crowd, popping fake blood sacks and gore on the ground to scare actual visitors. These people would have to lay down on the ground, acting dead, for the whole event, while real people would try to run and probably step on them, because they act dead. Also, shooting actually happened, but that &quot;shooter&quot; was aiming directly at the actors, and miss them just a bit, so non-actors think they got hit.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think these theories are absurd?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a lot of unnecessary assumptions.  </p>

<p>Nobody at the Mandalay Bay needs to know besides the owners who hand over control of the surveillance room to the FBI.  </p>

<p>Gunfire recordings can be played on military grade hidden speakers.  Real sounds played in real time heard by real people.  Not real gunfire.  What&#39;s so hard about that?</p>

<p>To control crowd behavior you have actors pretending to panic and run in a planned direction.  The real crowd eventually joins the flow even though you can clearly see many weren&#39;t concerned at all because they didn&#39;t sense any real danger.  The police also help direct the crowd.  To the police, it&#39;s a drill.</p>

<p>The gore scenes are surrounded by crisis actors in an area allocated to crisis actors.  What&#39;s so hard about that?  There is no real shooting.  That&#39;s why no bullets have been recovered and no one can find a bullet hole anywhere.</p>

<p>You call it absurd.  I call it a medium budget movie scene in one take with a good make-up team but bad actors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you post a link of the sound you are talking about?</p>

<p>The biggest debunk of the real shooter theory is the fact that zero bullets have been recovered and zero bullet marks have been found anywhere.  </p>

<p>Imagine going into a courtroom for preliminary hearing:</p>

<p>Prosecutor:  Your Honor, these men shot into a crowd killing 58 people and injuring 500.</p>

<p>Judge:  Have you recovered the bullets?</p>

<p>Prosecutor:  No.  But they really did it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire article is based on an interview with the supposed victim&#39;s father. The only photos are of a smiling young man and a seperate photo of a bloodied bullet next to a wallet. A glaring sign of bullshit is that the dad says his son still has the bullet with him. That&#39;s not possible. The bullet would be in police custody for evidence and the ballistics report.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just said this &quot; a glaring sign of bullshit is that the dad says his son still has the bullet with him.&quot; Nowhere in that article is written that this guys dad says that. Where did you just come up with this? Why lie like that? Haha seriously.

Nowhere does it say whatever you just said. You just don&#39;t want to believe this. </p>

<p>So now answer this one buddy. How the hell do you explain a bullet going through a wallet and cash with actual photos showing the evidence. The father corroborating text messages with the son and  a random woman helping the guy who got shot and that guy who was shot still alive to confirm what happened? I mean it&#39;s night and day with what you think happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so  if he gets to keep the bullet there&#39;s no crime to prosecute because the shooter is dead. What is there to prosecute? Also you can&#39;t explain a bullet going through a wallet going through cash lodged in between? Are you gonna say that&#39;s a prop and it was placed there before the shooting so this guy has a story to sell? I mean why would anyone work so hard to lie about a shooting going to the hospital with all kinds of witnesses that were helping him after getting shot with a bullet lodged in wallet! </p>

<p>I just did literally one minute of googling. That&#39;s it just to debunk your theory about zero bullets. </p>

<p>Also In most cases, if a bullet has not penetrated an internal organ or caused infection, doctors will leave it in rather than risk surgery. The surrounding tissue encapsulates the bullet, preventing it from dissolving and leaching into the blood.  </p>

<p>That is a fact. Not just an opinion. Removing bullets can cause nerve damage so there&#39;s another reason. You should research more. </p>

This ER would NOT be taking gunshot wounds. People would have been shirtless if they came into the ER with blood all over their shirts, they would have been removed by staff and disposed of, this is to minimize the impact of possible blood born pathogens.</p>

<p>The closest L2 Trauma center equipped to deal with this type of event is Sunrise Medical center, and indeed this is where severe injuries including Gunshots were sent.</p>

<p>There are three trauma centers in LV capable of dealing with this type of event and Valley Health doesn&#39;t operate any of them, what you are seeing here are secondary injuries that were sent to a nearby hospital to free up beds and medical staff of Sunrise to deal with trauma patients.</p>

I.e. the shoulder shot and lung damage, you do realize he shot from an angle and thus could easily hit a lung. Moving your arms would then not be extremely painful due to the joint being undamaged and painkillers received. You think these people will go through the next years of life without laughter? No, you try to make the best of it. </p>

<p>There&#39;s an enormous amount of credible evidence that the Vegas shooting was real, actually happened, and that Paddock was the shooter.</p>

<p>You claim that the evidence for evolution is credible, but the Christian <em>dismisses</em> that evidence <em>despite</em> its credibility. In much the same way, you and OP are <em>dismissing</em> the evidence for the Vegas shooting rather than <em>disproving</em> it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I figured that would piss you off. You&#39;re limited by your own cognitive bias.</p>

<p>You believe in evolution (so do I, but that doesn&#39;t matter) and yet you can&#39;t answer the question. Somehow, you expect me to answer yours.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to understand that you&#39;re asking the wrong person. I can&#39;t provide you with credible evidence for the Vegas shooting any more than you can provide me with credible evidence for evolution.</p>

<p>That being said, when people dispute evolution with me, I send them to the best starting point available:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution</a></p>

<p>Similarly, if you&#39;re honestly questioning the facts surrounding the Vegas shooting, I suggest you start here:</p>

<p>So he&#39;s the shooter because police and media say so? </p>

<p>A fair point, but only when the evidence isn&#39;t compelling is this relevant.</p>

<p>He was found alone in a hotel room, rented in his name, from which there was no demonstrable means of escape, surrounded by weapons that he had purchased which had been fired. Witness testimony from the floor below confirms the sound of gunfire from above. Hotel security testimony claims gunfire coming from inside the room and into the hallway. Stockpile of weapons discovered in Paddock&#39;s home.</p>

<p>In order to contradict the conclusion that Paddock was the shooter, one would need extremely compelling evidence that <em>he was not or may not have been the shooter</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably.</p>

<p>But my point is that shills and trolls are one thing, but the vast majority of people trust mainstream media implicitly. Or at least some people bizarrely attack it on one topic, but then accept its narrative on another! It boggles the mind.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to tell a shill from someone infected with TV-ism.</p>

<p>The MSM is obviously fully complicit in these hoaxes - as they wouldn&#39;t be able to sell the story without it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The culture of laziness and gullibility in terms of news consumption is a product of CFR policy and exacerbated by worsening economic conditions taking away people&#39;s free time and energy.</p>

<p>Corporate media serves as the mouthpiece for their owners who have investments in more important industries such as energy, tech, and MIC.  While making money is important, it is not as important as conditioning the public to accept the agenda of the oligarchy.  I think it&#39;s propaganda first and profit second for the MSM.</p>
