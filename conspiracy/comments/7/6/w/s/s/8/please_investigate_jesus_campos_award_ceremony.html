<p>On this page you&#39;ll find the &quot;award ceremony&quot; for Jesus Campos given to him for heroism which supposedly happened on October 10th.

Look at this image specifically:
<a href="http://spfpa.org/sites/default/files/styles/nivo_main/public/Web%20GROUP%20DINNER.jpg?itok=3WPp4-Ia">http://spfpa.org/sites/default/files/styles/nivo_main/public/Web%20GROUP%20DINNER.jpg?itok=3WPp4-Ia</a>
That photo was taken at Jean Georges Steakhouse at the Aria. Notice the texture on the walls. The LCD Panel in the back. The chandelier.
This photo was taken in the same room in 2013.

Why is this a problem? Because this steakhouse was completely and totally remodeled in July of this year.
<a href="https://vegas.eater.com/2017/7/14/15969768/jean-george-steakhouse-restaurant-remodel-aria-eater-inside">https://vegas.eater.com/2017/7/14/15969768/jean-george-steakhouse-restaurant-remodel-aria-eater-inside</a>
I&#39;ve looked at hundreds of pictures of this place. There are no traces of the old decor whatsoever and the only area that can possibly be that old room looks absolutely nothing like what it used to.
<a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ao5Mk-SxB08xlNP4L44vfUshW-U=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8850001/Jean_Georges_Steakhouse_10.jpg">https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ao5Mk-SxB08xlNP4L44vfUshW-U=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8850001/Jean_Georges_Steakhouse_10.jpg</a>
So tell me, how did Jesus Campos&#39; union have an award ceremony on October 10th in a room that no longer existed as of July this year?
Edit: For those of you linking images from the virtual tour on the Aria website. That tour is outdated. The images in the above article about the remodel clearly illustrate this. Look at the outside of the restaurant vs. in the virtual tour.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/3b5ejCd.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/3b5ejCd.jpg</a></p>

<p>Up until then the focus was on the wallpaper, the chandellier and the table. It was established that there&#39;s more than one banquet room, some had a total overhaul with new wallpaper. It was found the room from the campos photo is called the chefs table, and is denoted by the unique chandellier. There was also some confusion about the table pre and post renovation maybe having been changed. After all that somebody posted the above image taken in July.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was the one who posted that image. I think the OP of the original post was suggesting the entire restaurant was renovated. I scanned all of instagram, yelp and tripadvisor to find a picture of the Chefs table (on the restaurant website it notes this is the table that seats 12, as well as others on instagram who sat at the chefs table matching the image Campos is in) and this is the only one i found, on tripadvisor, POST renovation. It looks identical to the image that Campos is featured in, which disproves the claim that the entire restaurant was completely gut renovated. This image was taken and posted in July after they reopened. The chandelier, table and wall are the same as they are in the photo. Until someone is able to show me a photo of the chefs table today looking completely different, i&#39;m going to err on the side of logic and say that while i do believe there&#39;s a major conspiracy going on, i don&#39;t think it&#39;s here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That photo wasn’t photoshopped.  I was a photographer for years and edited a lot of photos.  I commented on the original post about that pic but it is pixelated, lacks definition, and has a flash creating shadows.  My 10 year old would do a better job photoshopping that in MS paint.  I highly doubt any govt agency would just send out a shoddy pic for no reason.</p>

If you pull it up in Lightroom and play with the contrast and blacks this area never changes, it has no depth, no shadows, it appears as if it was simply &quot;painted&quot; over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s his jacket.  He is leaning, his stance would shift his jacket to that side because of his cane.  The jacket falls to the side.  I could actually outline the entire coat for you.  Lightroom isn’t the best program for finding issues but regardless, this is a low quality photo, you’re not going to see tons of depth.  The shadow I spoke of is right below his fingers.  The jacket isn’t a shadow and would be flattened in detail from the flash.  </p>

<p>Listen, I’m not saying the whole event wasn’t shady, simply that in my opinion...having worked with photos for years, I don’t believe this was photoshopped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, people made this exact same point days ago, and even outlined what is clearly a jacket.</p>

<p>Also, days ago someone proved pretty clearly that one of the photos has exif meta data that says the photo was photoshopped, and has a date stamp from the day before the article says it was taken. Not saying that the photoshopped part is important, but no one was able to give a reasonable explanation why the date was off. </p>

<p>Either way, that&#39;s the only questionable thing I&#39;ve seen, and people are arguing about things that have already been argued. It&#39;s kinda pointless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was opened in photoshop and any type of lighting adjustment was done, it would qualify as being photoshopped.  If it was taken on a phone, the exif data is correct (if it wasn’t changed by some asshole).  If it’s on a camera that no one adjusted the date on, the meta tag would be wrong.  The source is important.  But I believe I saw this was taken on a phone so that part is shady, unless someone went back later and edited the exif data which can easily be done at any point.  If you don’t believe me, do a quick google search on editing exif, and yes, that includes the date taken.</p>

It looks like it was resized.  Which would account for the Adobe label alone, as for the date, I can’t know.  Either it was truly taken on a different day or someone edited the exif.  </p>

Gun shot sounds coming from speakers and wasn’t even real gunfire noise judging by all the videos with people saying it’s fake and smiling/laughing.  All the wounded and they only pictures we get are of bandages taped on supposed high powered rifle chest wounds.  Second shooter narrative used to distract the conspiracy community like it was used for Sandy Hook and all the other hoax shootings.  Look up the evidence.</p>

Seriously   if you look at it as a hoax like every shooting all the pieces fit together perfectly.  Why did Google scramble their hoax results after the shooting and change their damn algorithms?  Because people caught on too quick with Dan Blizeren&#39;s bad acting and doctor Phil girl playing her crisis actor parts.  YouTube is DELETING good hoax videos.  Please tell me why they would do that if the idea is so ridiculous?  Why not leave them up to &quot;ridicule them&quot;?

<p>The people were laughing and saying it’s fake because it takes a while for the human brain to fully comprehend a situation like that.  They didn’t immediately see death, so they thought it was fireworks and sound effects.  There were so many people and really only a small fraction got shot, it would be hard for the majority to understand right away that it was a real shooting in the middle of their good time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this guy Falco is full of shit. I have no doubt he went to the hotel to look around. He has a whole string of tweets where he is pointing things out he thinks do not make sense. Then to get attention drawn to his &quot;investigation&quot; that he did, he decides to make up a story that he was banned for life for poking around the hotel. To try any make his claim that he was banned seem believable he somehow aquires a form that&#39;s used by security to actual ban people from the hotel. He just does not realize that people will notice his proof of being banned is a letter that needs to be filled out by the hotel staff in order to be valid. I guess the people he is trying to get to follow on twitter are the type of people who will just blindly follow him and agree with anything he states as fact without actually objectively looking at his proof. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to tell but to me, it doesn&#39;t look like the same room based on the two photos. The tables look like different colors and the plates sitting in front of the guests are different.</p>

<p>The plates could be explained away because the other photo looks like a reserved party. Maybe they had different plates for that event?</p>

<p>Also I don&#39;t see the center piece (brown box-like object) that you can see in the Campos picture.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s not enough evidence either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me that in order for you to contend that these pictures are manipulated or fake, or whatever. You need to prove this part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That photo was taken at Jean Georges Steakhouse at the Aria. Notice the texture on the walls. The LCD Panel in the back. The chandelier. This photo was taken in the same room in 2013.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where is the contention, and by whom, that this took place where you said it took place? I don&#39;t see that the SPFPA says &#39;we did this at the Jean George&#39;s Steakhouse.&#39; So you appear to be saying &#39;these guys faked this whole thing because the picture of the SPFPA wasn&#39;t taken where they say it was taken,&#39; but haven&#39;t indicated that anyone claims it was taken there. That is not proven by the evidence that you have presented. </p>

<p>Furthermore, on review your contention &#39;I&#39;ve looked at hundreds of pictures of this place. There are no traces of the old decor whatsoever and the only area that possibly be that old room...&#39;</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/0Th2DBo">Here</a><br/>
I copied out this photo from the &#39;Eater&#39; slide show.</p>

<p>See the pattern in the back, dead center in the photo? That fully matches the pattern in the back of the SPFPA photo.... </p>

<p>So... look... this is not sound. You aren&#39;t right, you missed obvious visual information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I debunked this yesterday. I thought it was a good lead until someone posted the link to the virtual tour of the restaurant. There are many intimate rooms with similar decor throughout the place. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/5GVTa">https://imgur.com/a/5GVTa</a> First pic is an area near the magazine&#39;s remodel pic, with the rounded chandeliers. Second pic is the exact room with the Vegas award.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is something mildly interesting.</p>

<p>The first picture with the plaque has this file n ame: <a href="http://spfpa.org/sites/default/files/styles/nivo_main/public/Web%20GROUP%20with%20plaque_0.jpg?itok=Bztk1lI-">http://spfpa.org/sites/default/files/styles/nivo_main/public/Web%20GROUP%20with%20plaque_0.jpg?itok=Bztk1lI-</a></p>

<p>The picture of them at the table eating dinner has this: <a href="http://spfpa.org/sites/default/files/styles/nivo_main/public/Web%20GROUP%20DINNER.jpg?itok=3WPp4-Ia">http://spfpa.org/sites/default/files/styles/nivo_main/public/Web%20GROUP%20DINNER.jpg?itok=3WPp4-Ia</a></p>

<p>Where as the up close picture of the plaque itself has this filename: <a href="http://spfpa.org/sites/default/files/styles/nivo_main/public/IMG_1005.JPG?itok=FdzufPlp">http://spfpa.org/sites/default/files/styles/nivo_main/public/IMG_1005.JPG?itok=FdzufPlp</a></p>

<p>The last one being what looks like the naming convention from a phone or digital camera, but the other two are clearly saved versions of the image.
Nothing conclusive, but found it interesting none the less.</p>
