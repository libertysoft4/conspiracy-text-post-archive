What better way to dissuade conspiratorial speculation by the general public than by gas lighting the entire country. Get everyone to buy into a conspiracy by releasing questionable information, then follow that up with irrefutable proof that Paddock really was just a lone wolf. He had cameras set up after all. If they were filming, the full story is out there. You could even say the Weinstein thing is part of it--start scratching that conspiracy itch, then in one swoop make the whole country feel stupid and crazy for doubting the official narrative. </p>

<p>So Russians sitting at a computer in the comfort of their own country accomplishing things that no army is capable of is just too far out there for you, huh?</p>

<p>Would you mind filling me in on why the CIA and FBI would undermine the American peoples confidence in the American Government? Seems kinda self defeating doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>At least there is a clear benefit for Russian trolls. It&#39;s also easy and cost effective to put thousands of Russian geeks to work doing the bidding of Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Motive and opportunity is usually more than enough for any other conspiracy theory. Flat Earth gets more traction around here. Don&#39;t you think that is strange?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, but maybe a little? Some of the narrative just seems so blatantly inconsistent. So I guess what I think is that there are three options, cover up of something bigger, intentional muddying of the waters for whatever reason, FBI sucks and just can&#39;t find anything or some combo of the three. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying that I don&#39;t want to believe the FBI is as confused as we are or that some shadow entity orchestrated the event And that it is starting to feel like the narrative is intentionally being manipulated now for some reason. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a subtle psyop trick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A large part of what is at play with  MGM disputing the police narrative is most likely them trying to mitigate their liability and the potential law suites that could arise depending on the course of events. </p>

<p>As for Campos, I feel like given all the speculation, theories, and agendas being pushed around the event, he might have decided that his anonymity was more valuable than whatever fox was paying him, that or for the reasons above MGM will make it worth his while to get his story to match their preferences sequence of events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can definitely get behind this as well. The 6 minutes prior to shooting narrative puts blame on MGM making it seem like they tried to handle it quietly. But it could also put blame on the police depending on how MGM spins it. </p>
