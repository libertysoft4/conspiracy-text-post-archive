I don&#39;t think anyone wants to see a bunch of speculation and re-hashing of the same articles over and over.  If anything official were released - I think you&#39;d see a surge in articles and posts.  Heck, even if a new angle or glimmer of new information was learned (ie - not from official sources) I think you would see an uptick in posts about that.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of detail in some of those photos. You can copy-paste the urls to watch the videos yourself, and as is stated, I&#39;m not making claims one way or other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing substantial.</p>

<p>I think there may be something substantial there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So when you go on every thread about Las Vegas posting links to your thread, yes, that is bad form.</p>

<p>I commented a few times in one thread and once in another within five minutes of each other. I fail to see how that even remotely constitutes going &quot;on every thread about Las Vegas posting links to your thread&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re all busy, I get that, but there&#39;s no reason why you, or anyone reading this can&#39;t do that themselves.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Better than hardly contributing at all except to criticize someone posting the same link a few times, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>people still think there were multiple gunmen and actors at the festival, even though there are videos clearly showing people getting hit (1 dude had a bullet enter his back that went into his upper arm where it circled around his bone and failed to exit his body: youtu.be/JpsqirFRdTo?t=152 watch the guy to the right with the dark blue shirt, around 2:34).</p>

<p>And if you combine different footages together you can clearly tell there is only 1 gun being fired at all times. And its always from the Mandalay bay.
Or the &quot;GoPro&quot; footage (<a href="https://youtu.be/muiHkkbPpdU">https://youtu.be/muiHkkbPpdU</a>), in which you can hear all shots, from the first to the last, except for when he was firing at the hallway.</p>

<p>There was no conspiracy, it was a lone gunman and people are making complete fools out of themselves for accusing the LVMPD and the FBI of being part in a conspiracy.
There are people making videos claiming they know the &quot;truth&quot; yet they clearly don&#39;t know shit, but their videos are reaching thousands sometimes even hundreds of thousands of views. Those people will deeply regret putting their faces online once the investigation is 
 finished as it shows them for the ass clowns that they; Too lazy to properly investigate simple claims, falling for rumors that have been debunked on day 2, completely paranoid &quot;oh you&#39;re just a shill, there is no way someone could do that it must have been the government&quot;, listening to their gut feelings instead of just observing the footage that is provided.</p>

<p>If the deepstate did las Vegas there would have been 300 dead, i could imagine even 800.
It&#39;s kinda insulting to those that did 9/11 to say they did Las Vegas too. 9/11 took a lot of effort to pull off, Vegas was one man going crazy that had his plans spoiled because he was detected too early.</p>

<p>The only question that might remain is why people heard gunshots at the Tropicana hours later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the official narrative is that it would be so easy to eliminate most of the doubt of 99% of the &quot;conspiracy people&quot; by just (i) showing a few CCTV pictures of Paddock entering/leaving his room, (ii) some CCTV pictures where bags are transported into his room, (iii) a more or less complete timeline of what Paddock was doing for the last 3 days prior to the shooting (this should be no problem with the amount of cameras in Las Vegas), and (iv) a reasonable explanation for Paddocks death..</p>

<p>But it seems all these things do not exist.. Remember, LVPD had to change their story everyday, most likely because they actually do not have any clue what was going on..</p>

<p>This really surprises me. Why wouldn&#39;t they have cameras in the hallways? Seems rather short sighted; a building with cameras in every nook and cranny, and yet they don&#39;t bother putting cameras in the hallways where the guests stay? Seems ripe for a sexual assault lawsuit or something. </p>

<p>I am sure they have a reason for not installing cameras on hotel floors, but yeah, just never would have thought that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;...people still think there were multiple gunmen and actors at the festival, even though there are videos clearly showing people getting hit (1 dude had a bullet enter his back that went into his upper arm where it circled around his bone and failed to exit his body: youtu.be/JpsqirFRdTo?t=152 watch the guy to the right with the dark blue shirt, around 2:34).&quot;</p>

<p>Had to write you off as hopeless after vetting this initial comment. The video linked shows nothing definitive, certainly not a bullet entering anyone and failing to exit their body. If anything this video makes crisis actors seem more believable. Pretty odd that you found that to be compelling evidence. Confirmation bias I guess...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misread my response. This guy stated that his link showed definitive evidence of a specific person being shot...yet the video shows nothing of the sort at the time he specified. All it looms like is a bunch of people running around in the dark. </p>

<p>I therefore find it odd that he made such a strong claim that turned out not to be evident whatsoever in the link provided. In other words this video does noting to disprove the crisis actor theory. This is not to say that I personally believe that crisis actors were used, merely that this persons comment is oddly certain of its conclusions without the proper evidence to back it up.</p>

<p>We already know crisis actors were used in Boston so I of course keep my mind open. I&#39;m on the fence about this event, leaning more toward an actual shooting due to a lack of compelling evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>Your appeal to incredulity is a blatant logical fallacy btw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh jeez look, sarcasm directed towards one of the few people here that actually look at things sensibly. Lol</p>

<p>I get tired of hearing the same shit regurgitated every day thats already been proven false, like this guy mentioned. Itd be refreshing for people to be able to look at evidence themselves and make decisions based on facts and not just feelings.. then getting butthurt when someone comes along and reminds them that theyre reaching hard af. </p>

<p>Imaginations gone wild throughout half this sub.. and half the people legit think their theory is not only possible, but factual, even after being proven wrong. </p>

<p>I swear the first couple days after the tragedy, there was some prime info posted around here. But since then, its gotten so bad around here... that Id rather listen to the BS official narrative and know im being lied to, than to try to understand how random people can be so dense with their theories... going so far as saying its all a hoax and no one was ever injured or killed. Like WTF even</p>

<p>Its been partially relieving tbh seeing all this Weinstein shit for a change, since at least everyone agrees he and Hollywood as a whole are evil af and that its really happening. Though I will admit, seeing such little evidence or news of anything Vegas related is both suspicious and sad to me. Front page for days now: Weinstein shit, Jesus missing still, random Hilary shit still for some reason, and other than that absolutely nothing new... interesting... or factual has been released. This place needs to be purged</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally agree with him on a lot of his points, I don&#39;t think this was planned by the &quot;deep state&quot;, or that there were multiple shooters or any of that shit. There are crazy people out there who would simply like to end their life and be known as the guy with the biggest body count in modern American history. With that being said, there&#39;s no where near enough information to take a strong stance one way or another. To simply dismiss all other theories though with little evidence is not sensible imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you haven’t seen the footage of the gunfire coming out of a fucking helicopter then huh? Do you honestly believe one guy could have gotten all those guns and ammunition up through a casino without anyone noticing? Just my theory, but this was an FBI sting gone horribly wrong. There were multiple gunmen/women, and any/all witnesses who speak out seem to be disappearing or killed. The official story reeks to high heaven. Where’s the cctv footage of one guy carrying tons of weapons/ammo up through a casino where all angles and floor spaces are covered? There are cameras in the employee elevators as well. Moreover, and this is the most important fact of them all, there was a fema drill scheduled. Every single one of these “terrorist” acts have one thing in common: drills. Every one has had a drill scheduled. These are false flag events designed to distract, divide and conquer. The day after all I could see on social media was people talking about changing the second amendment. The United States government has shown they have no problem killing, surveilling, and/or plotting against their own citizens. Whether it’s the government or one of the ABC agencies, or a rogue faction or independent contractors. It’s easier to explain motive for the FBI/CIA than it is to explain why some rich white male would all of a sudden open fire on innocent concert goers. Find the video of the gunfire from the helicopter. It’s out there. Hopefully that will change your mind. </p>

Me and my friends carried multiple musical instruments, including 7 guitars in hard cases into our rooms at Excalibur a couple years ago. Anything could have been in our instrument cases. Nobody checks your luggage to see whats inside at the hotels in Vegas. Considering Paddock was there for several days before the shooting he just had to make a few trips, like 1 a day, with his guns in his luggage. Really not that hard. Hell I&#39;ve even seen people bring in giant trunks as luggage at the hotels in Vegas before.</p>

Yes and im sure anyone else could do it as well. Hotels don&#39;t check your luggage, costumers have something called privacy.</p>

No.</p>

There are still eyewitness left that claim to have heard/seen multiple gunmen. </p>

<p>Where’s the cctv footage of one guy carrying tons of weapons/ammo up through a casino where all angles and floor spaces are covered?
There are no cameras in the hallway of Mandalay Bay, so you&#39;ll never get CCTV footage of Paddock entering his room. Though there are cameras at the entrances and we might see those one day. But this just goes to show how uninformed you are about the whole thing if you&#39;re still convinced their are cameras in the hallway of Mandalay bay. </p>

<p>Moreover, and this is the most important fact of them all, there was a Fema drill scheduled
yeah i can&#39;t find anything about it so i have to say you fell for fake news.</p>

<p>The day after all I could see on social media was people talking about changing the second amendment.
They are always doing that, you have a bunch of traitors sitting in your government and a big chunk of your population is brainwashed, no surprise there.</p>

<p>The United States government has shown they have no problem killing, surveilling, and/or plotting against their own citizens.
I know but this alone isn&#39;t prove of las vegas being a hoax.</p>

<p>find the video of the gunfire from the helicopter. It’s out there.
yeah and you find a therapist. I saw the videos of the helicopters, they are entirely made up bullshit. Why are there still shots hitting the people when the chopper&#39;s behind a building? all videos fail to explain this &quot;little&quot; detail.</p>

<p>Just my theory, but this was an FBI sting gone horribly wrong.
How could it go wrong if they were shooting from the helicopter anyway? Did they forget the fuel for the helicopter? Not enough ammo? Did they suddenly realize you can&#39;t properly engage a target from a mile in a helicopter and decided to call it a day? ah no wait, that&#39;s right, the FBI was dealing weapons with ISIS at the Mandalay Bay and Paddock was an FBI agent that got shot by the ISIS terrorists and the Terrorists decided to pull off a terrorist attack and for some reason the FBI helicopter decided to go along with it and fired at the crowd...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, if the people that did 9/11 did Las Vegas you would have 5 shootings occurring simultaneously all over the strip. It&#39;s just funny to me how i am accused of being a shill when there is blatant fake news being spread around. When 9/11 happened and the truth movement started to grow you couldn&#39;t just share some made up bullshit, people were very skeptical of anything and disinfo got called out rather quick, but today the alternative media doesn&#39;t give a shit anymore, everyone is just busy trying to frame his political opponents. The left was thinking it was a racist gun-nut, the alt-right thought it was the deepstate or Antifa, the muslims were pissed the media didn&#39;t call him a terrorist, the europeans were cynical about it cause things like these are supposed to happen in the US because the 2nd Amendment is evil, and the Germans actually found a way to blame themselves for it</p>

An FBI sting gone wrong leads to a man firing from a hotel into a crowd at a concert? K.
And I love the whole “how dare they not release the video that we’re entitled to!” bs. They don’t owe at home detectives anything. 
I would love to see clear video of someone firing out of a helicopter, but you won’t share it because it doesn’t exist. If that was the case, the shooter in the helicopter must be an awful shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for very succinctly stating exactly my thoughts also.  I&#39;ve not been commenting on this because it&#39;s so tiring and maddening to just be told that I&#39;m a shill ect, ect.  Fact of the matter is 9/11 was a complete psy-op along with the actual destruction.  There is an entire generation that believes that EVERYTHING is a conspiracy.  Occam&#39;s razor is usually pretty bang on.  </p>

<p>The only question that might remain is why people heard gunshots at the Tropicana hours later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed there are enough eyewitness accounts to suggest that the Tropicana most likely had a shooting incident well after Paddock was dead. Possibly other hotels, but just &quot;possibly&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you combine different footages together you can clearly tell there is only 1 gun being fired at all times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s where I have to disagree. The Vegas cabbie footage that was posted to Facebook clearly records gunfire from two VERY different positions. Just watch the first 1min 30sec.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI7HQYz1hCc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI7HQYz1hCc</a></p>

<p>(this is a video I put up, from the source FB video)</p>

<p>The cabbie footage starts about 10:10pm, five minutes into the shooting.</p>

<p>Worth noting about this footage:</p>

<p>1) You can hear the &quot;nearby&quot; gunfire at the beginning of the video. Those shots end at about the 6 second mark.</p>

<p>Between 0:46 and 0:53 seconds, you can hear 2 sets of &quot;distant&quot; gunfire that are not echos, as they are different patterns.</p>

<p>At the 1:07 mark, 13 seconds later, the nearby gunfire kicks in again.</p>

<p>2) the smaller room with the second broken window was locked from the other side when SWAT showed up and had to breach it. It was also reported that the only shots fired from the smaller room were the initial shots at the fuel tanks.</p>

<p>If point 2) is accurate, then there&#39;s no way that the &quot;distant&quot; gunfire at 0:46 came from the second window. Given the position of the cabbie, shots from this window would not be as loud, but I&#39;m not sure if the sound profile entirely matches, especially when you compare it to the gunfire recorded as she passes under the roofed area at the 1:15 mark. This is where she puts down her phone to roll up her window, so you can&#39;t really make comparisons between shots pre and post this point in time.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve yet to see a plausible explanation for Paddock being the source of the gunfire that starts at 0:46.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had people suggest that this is when he fired at Campos, but that doesn&#39;t fit any version of the official timeline. They originally reported Paddock engaged Campos AFTER the mass shooting, and later revised it to BEFORE the mass shooting.</p>

<p>This gunfire comes in the MIDDLE of the mass shooting. According to the official (admittedly ever-changing) timeline, there was no engagement with security or police in the middle of the mass shooting.</p>

<p>Also note this image...</p>

<p><a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/02/us/mandalay-bay-vegas-shooting-1506946492937/mandalay-bay-vegas-shooting-1506946492937-facebookJumbo-v18.jpg">https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/02/us/mandalay-bay-vegas-shooting-1506946492937/mandalay-bay-vegas-shooting-1506946492937-facebookJumbo-v18.jpg</a></p>

<p>If all shots are from Paddock, and the difference in sound is supposedly the two windows (which does NOT jibe with the official timeline), there&#39;s a massive discrepancy between travelling to the small room, and later back to the main room...</p>

<p>0:06 - 0:46 is 40 seconds, which is easily doable.
0:53 - 1:07 is 14 seconds, less than half the time.</p>

<p>If the door from the smaller room was locked from the smaller room&#39;s side, Paddock, would have to have gone out into the hallway, then move to the main suite and resume firing there in the course of 14 seconds. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not impossible, but highly improbable, IMHO.</p>

<p>The distance he would have to cover is about 85 feet (with a little leeway either way). That can be done at a brisk walk/trot, including a keycard to access if the door wasn&#39;t left ajar, but that&#39;s also assuming that he&#39;s NOT stopping to make sure the coast is clear, even though he has cameras set up.</p>

<p>Again, they officially report that only initial shots came out of that room. Even if that&#39;s wrong, what would his motivation be to move to the smaller room, which presented a more awkward shooting angle to the concert, and less opportunities for cover, while in the middle of it all, and surrounded by weapons and ammo?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no conspiracy, it was a lone gunman and people are making complete fools out of themselves for accusing the LVMPD and the FBI of being part in a conspiracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that settles that. Seriously though, one can not believe the official narrative (and since it keeps changing in details, how can you), while NOT saying the LVMPD and FBI are complicit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are people making videos claiming they know the &quot;truth&quot; yet they clearly don&#39;t know shit,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s always best to ignore people who claim they KNOW the &quot;truth&quot;, and focus on those more interested in looking at the information being presented from all sources with a critical eye.</p>

<p>It&#39;s honestly one of the problems I had with the branding of people questioning 9/11 as &quot;Truthers&quot;. If you didn&#39;t buy the official story, you suddenly believed that invisible heat rays being fired from satellites destroyed those building, because all &quot;Truthers&quot; all believed the most outrageous and unsubstantiated claims.</p>

<p>Both sides of discussions that go that route should be summarily dismissed as Catholics arguing with Protestants about using grape juice vs. wine during communion.</p>

<p>no, he&#39;s firing inside the hotel, if you synchronize other footages with the cab driver video you can tell there are not shots being fired at the harvest festival as the gunman is firing down the hallway.</p>

<p>you are looking right at it, he&#39;s firing down the hallway, that&#39;s why the gunshots sound muffled. If you watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/muiHkkbPpdU?t=505">GoPro</a> Footage at the 8:20 mark you can clearly tell there is nobody shooting. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/QSb1w">8:20 of the gopro footage is 0:45 of the cab driver video.</a></p>

<blockquote>

No, originally it was said during the shooting, not after. Then it was changed to 6 minutes prior to the shots at the crowd.</p>

<p>Where do you get this from? Meaning that only the initial shots came from the smaller room? Press conference? LVMPD tweeter account? Because i can&#39;t really believe he only shot the tanks from the eastern window (small room) and nothing else. I watched the footage so often i&#39;m sure he switched the windows a few times, i can&#39;t prove it though. If it&#39;s true there should be only a few brasses lying in the small room and the LVMPD could easily confirm this but i can&#39;t remember them saying anything like that.</p>

<p>I have no explanation as for why he changed position either, when he was firing with a bumb stock he was standing anyway and the window would have made little difference while standing. The pillar on the northern window could get in your way when you try to lay down and use a rifle with a bipod.</p>

<p>but i&#39;d really like to know where you get the report of the initial shots from? Im working on a 3D replication of the event and it&#39;d help me alot. I was waiting for the LVMPD to tell us which door of the smaller room was sealed.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I asked for a &quot;plausible&quot; reason. </p>

<p>From an acoustic POV, firing down the hallway is a POSSIBLE explanation, though I don&#39;t think the gunshots sound muffled enough to explain the hallway argument. There seems to be too much reverberation for gunshots where the only egress for sound waves would be the broken window, but I won&#39;t concede the possibility.</p>

<p>I said &quot;no plausible reason&quot; because from a MOTIVE POV, there&#39;s no reason for him to be firing down the hallway at that time in the shooting. This is about 5 minutes into the attack, well after his encounter with Campos, and well before police arrived on the 32nd floor.</p>

<p>If you find his motive plausible, who or what motivated him to fire into the hallway at that point?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where do you get this from? Meaning that only the initial shots came from the smaller room? Press conference? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was from one of the early press conferences, about a week after (8th or 9th), where Lombardo said he believes Paddock initially shot at fuel tanks as a diversion.</p>

<p>IIRC it was the same day that they revised the time of Campos arrival.</p>

<p>Maybe he started shooting at them again later, but any reports I&#39;ve seen don&#39;t mention anything other than two recovered rounds that did strike fuel tanks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also not a hill I&#39;m willing to die on given the lack of concrete evidence, and it was speculation on Lombardo&#39;s part.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe any of them, I keep an open mind, and follow evidence.</p>

<p>The only consistent thing I&#39;ve seen involves Campos. The story mainly changes based on him from day one, and they have absolutely proven that a photo of him at the reward ceremony was run through Photoshop, but also that the meta data says it was taken the day before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original timeline had Campos heroically interuptting the shooter after the shooting began. </p>

<p>The updated &amp; current timelines have Campos arriving after the shooting began. </p>

<p>Campos likely had a panic attack prior to the inverview and cancelled. Went to clinic. Is with his family. </p>

<p>Would you want everyone in your town and the world to see your face and hear you speak? You’d be instantly recognizable to everyone and you can’t go back from that. </p>

<p>Will rational people think of Campos as “the guy who failed to stop the shooting”? No but there’s a lot of crazy angry people in his town. I definitely wouldn’t want my face out there under those circumstances. </p>

<p>It’s not exciting but it makes complete sense and it sitting right there.  I know that’s not what this sub wants to hear (everyone seems to pray there’s a conspiracy afoot). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, the original reason we were given for Campos responding, is that the person staying in some room below him heard the shooting called the front desk. Within the week, it read changed to a door alarm.</p>

<p>Last Monday it was said he actually was called there 6 minutes before Paddock started firing into the crowd.</p>

<p>By Thursday MGM said that isn&#39;t true.
On Friday they went with the revised statement that Campos found a blockaded door at 9:59pm(sorry if my timing is off), and that he was shot sometime between when he actually arrived (original narrative), and when police arrived.</p>

<p>What&#39;s obvious from what you said, is you didn&#39;t watch Fridays press conference. Please, watch it, then adjust your argument.</p>

<p>My point remains, the only things that have changed involve the security guard. The engineer involved only complicates the most recent narrative.</p>

<p>But either way, watch this past Fridays press conference, it&#39;s the ultimate flip flop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the change from Friday. But either way Campos was originally made out to be the hero that interrupted the shooting. Now he’s not. He’s the security guard who got shot and THEN the shooting started. </p>

<p>I understand the significance in the change but it doesn’t change my point above. </p>

<p>If you are the guy who got there before the shooting and didn’t stop it would you want for face and voice permanently stamped all over Vegas for eternity? Vegas is such a weird town - no way I would. </p>

<p>He’s probably so overwhelmed at the magnitude of attention and media that he’s nervous, scared and waiting for this to die down. </p>

<p>If he were having mental issues due to all of this, it would have been reported.

<p>They could simply say something like that. </p>

<p>But to go out of their way to change the story multiple times, and then the guy was scheduled to have all these interviews (he would have had to be the one agreeing to the time, place, and outlet interviewing him, would he not?

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously until we know the truth everything is speculation. That&#39;s how good detectives work. They come up with several stories and look at all the facts to narrow down what actually happened. Unfortunately we don&#39;t get all the facts as &quot;internet detectives&quot; (as we&#39;ve been called by sheriff Lombardo) so we&#39;re stuck trying to piece it together as best we can with whatever records and footage we can dig from the web.</p>

<p>There are 2 videos circulating that sound very distinctively like 2 firearms at the same time. There is also a rate of fire issue. 800 rounds per minute is the rate of fire for an AR15 if made to be automatic. The rounds are being heard at a rate of 600 rpm. Even with technical issues with the bump fire it is impossible to keep it at a steady rate of 600 rpm. I&#39;m a gun enthusiast not a firearms expert, but many experts are coming out and saying these two statements appear to be true.</p>

<p>Obviously the only way to truly verify what weapons were actually being used is to see the room after it was breached. We are never going to see those pictures or probably even the video for that matter. But one thing is for sure. If they are so confident Paddock was a lone shooter and he had lost his mind and commited this alone then there is no reason to not release the video surveillance and photos from the room.</p>

<p>Not releasing the video shows there was either a high level of incompetence from the security there or there were others involved. Not releasing the pictures shows there is something in his room they were hiding from the public, be it isis related material, or the actual guns used, or possibly a second shooter. </p>

<p>Regardless of what you think about the events that happened on the first in that room, the lack of transparency and changing of key details multiple times in the narrative screams that the LVMPD and FBI are doing something nefarious. I&#39;m not a &quot;conspiracy guy&quot; by any means. But this whole thing stinks. I hope that we can learn the truth regardless of its consequences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. Weird. I understand not putting cameras in the rooms themselves for privacy reasons, but the hallway just seems strange to me. Vegas is a town with lots of booze, drugs and sex. It just seems like it would be way too common of occurrence for a guest to potentially try and force themselves on an unwilling patron or into an unwilling patrons room, which of course would make hallway cameras very useful. Also would be very useful in the event of an accident, in order for the hotel to potentially prove they weren&#39;t being negligent. </p>

<p>The part that makes absolutely zero sense, is the &quot;200 shots&quot; toward Campos. If he fired at Campos after he fired on the crowd, there should be a period police can identify where no one in the crowd was actually being hit.</p>

<p>Also, I think there would be a distinct difference in the sound of the gunfire, he wouldn&#39;t be standing at the window shooting thought the door at Campos, when it&#39;s so far away. I&#39;ve heard gunfire change when the shooter moves in relation to walls and other obstacles.</p>

<p>Either way, there&#39;s all these explanations that have changed, and almost all have been in regards to details surrounding the security guard, and was only more complicated by the engineer they called, who&#39;s official story was never adapted back to the new narrative we were given on Friday.</p>

Just today at work I heard a couple suburban mothers questioning the official narrative, I was quite surprised that they were not only talking about the missing security guard, but they mentioned the death of the 2nd witness as well as the possibility of two shooters. It was really a weird moment to hear them </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone reached the point where you have many possible explanations that all make more sense than the authorities?</p>

<p>I&#39;m seriously looking into helicopters, Blackwater security, a fabricated pasty, and a complacent investigation from the government. Lack of transparency on key players involved just makes me think the Fed&#39;s are hiding their involvement under an underdeveloped plot, lacking motive. And frankly it makes me question why these people are in charge on this investigation when it has been a few weeks and they have released basically nothing, and yes sheriff, I question your competence.</p>

<p>Although a large portion of people DO think something’s fishy, unfortunately it’s not enough yet to really break the case open. IMO.</p>

This really hit home for a lot of locals and it&#39;s amazing how no one really cares about all the nonsense going on with this investigation. Either something pops up soon that&#39;s going to blow this thing out of the water or it&#39;ll get swept under the rug. I guessing the latter</p>

<p>Just curious, why wouldn&#39;t they? I would assume a nice Vegas hotel like this would have security cameras in the hallway, since that town is completely covered in CCTV cameras. Why wouldn&#39;t those videos exist?</p>
