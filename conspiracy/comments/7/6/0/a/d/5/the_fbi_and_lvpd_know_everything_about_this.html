        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">127</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/stickdog99.html">stickdog99</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The LVPD knows exactly who called them first about about the Vegas shooting, when they were first informed about the Vegas shooting, what they were told when about the Vegas shooting, why it took them so long to respond to the Vegas shooting, why the supposed first responders waited one floor below Paddock&#39;s until the shooting stopped, and why they were surprised to find a shot Jesus Campos on that floor when they arrived. The LVPD also knows why they waited 70 minutes (and over an hour after the shooting had stopped) to break into Paddock&#39;s suite just to find the supposed culprit dead. They know within five minutes what time Paddock was actually shot, what caliber of bullets were used to shoot him, what angles those bullets entered his body, whether his wounds were more consistent with murder or suicide, and whether he had sufficient residue on his body, gloves, and clothes to have actually been the trigger man.</p>

<p>They also know whether there is any casino security footage whatsoever that shows Paddock (or anyone else) bringing all those guns up to the suite. They know who booked the room adjacent to Paddock, approximately when each of the windows in the two rooms were broken, and whether they were broken from the inside or the outside. They know each and every time anyone opened the doors of either of these rooms, each time anyone used the hotel phones in either room, what numbers were called from these phones, and how long these calls lasted. And if they asked the NSA, they could also find out exactly what was said. </p>

<p>They know exactly when and how the inhabitants of these rooms used their cell phones, what emails and texts they sent and when they sent them, the content of all these emails and texts, and the GPS locations of their cellphones at all relevant times. They know what every person of interest in this case recently purchased with a credit card and exactly when they purchased it. They also know when and how many times Paddock traveled back to Mesquite (or wherever) during his stay from his car and cellphone GPS logs and his credit card purchase history. </p>

<p>They know actually what is on the note they found. They know who Campos was working for, where he was really shot, which gun shot him from what distance, and what he was really doing on the 32nd floor (assuming that he was actually there). And assuming all of this is not total bullshit, they know what Paddock was trying to do with the drill, whether Paddock was actually using security cameras, and if so for what. And they know exactly how many bullets of which calibers were fired from which distances from which directions with which guns. </p>

<p>And they have known all this information for almost a week now. If not, what the hell are we paying them for?</p>

<p>But we have no idea how much of the ever changing narrative they have released to us is true and how much is false because nobody in our corporate stenographer pool will ask <em>any</em> of these patently obvious questions.</p>

<p>And instead of sharing the facts of this case that they most assuredly must have by now, they are instead going to put up billboards all over Las Vegas asking anyone with any knowledge or evidence of this case to come forward to help them determine the safest completely rewritten final official lie to tell us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit 35th floor to 32nd - as so many other have questioned, they will not tell us anything. Now the narrative of the Hollywood Pedo has come out and almost immediately the LV shooting has taken a back seat, even in this sub, a majority of it is about Hollywood, I don’t give 2 shits about any of those people, I want to know about LV but ask anything of substance and nobody has anything to share. Of course it might help if we ACTUALLY got info reliable to go off of </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Despite the posts here, the guy was a rapist, not a pedo. But I&#39;ll agree, I don&#39;t give a fuck. Rapists and anything illegal is bad, sure.. but they&#39;re only giving more attention to attention whores.</p>

<p>My position? I know the names of some actors I&#39;ve liked. I don&#39;t know the names of producers and directors and.. because who gives a fuck?</p>

<p>I think the people that make a big deal out of the people, rather than the crime, are the same people that have far too much attention to people that don&#39;t fucking matter.</p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;ve seen more people defending Micheal Jackson in response to this (in r/conspiracy I find this weird, in the past he wasn&#39;t defended for sure).. even saw one person try to say what the rapist did is worse than what maybe Jackson did.. and it was fucking awful.</p>

<p>Bottom line, to those making posts and commenting on this shit.. all you&#39;re doing is making famous people that shouldn&#39;t matter feel more important.</p>

<p>Whatever chick that had her Twitter blocked for 12 hours? I don&#39;t know who she is, I don&#39;t care, and all you&#39;ve done is make her think she&#39;s God&#39;s gift.</p>

<p>My opinion, rich people do fucked up shit. Why? Because they&#39;re rich, they can, and they&#39;re bored doing normie stuff. Period. Not all of them, sure.. but I&#39;m 100% sure that people just as rich as some Hollywood fucker, are just as likely to be sick twisted people with a mental disorder.</p>

<p>I think the possibility of an average Joe being sick and twisted in the same way is probably close to equal % wise. The elite just might be guilty of it more because they know they have money and influence to get out of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, let&#39;s think about this from a logical standpoint (absurd, I know).</p>

<p>I&#39;m the second shooter. I&#39;m paranoid that I&#39;m going to be caught. Over a week later, the police are still saying it was the one guy. I relax.. mission accomplished.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen anything that convinces me there was more than one shooter (based on every video, every claim, everything I&#39;ve seen outside mainstream news).</p>

<p>But if there was, and I was that guy, if they said they believe there&#39;s another shooter, I&#39;m going to be a hell of a lot more careful.</p>

<p>Yes, TV/movies tend to dramatize things.. but in this case, with basic logic, you wouldn&#39;t want to tell the bad guy you know they exist.</p>

<p>Maybe there&#39;s not another shooter, likely even if there was, we&#39;ll never be told.. but the simplest explanation why they&#39;d quickly say there wasn&#39;t, regardless, is to lull them into feeling like they&#39;re safe.</p>

<p>They told everyone right in the name.</p>

<p>They want the North American Union, they are driving for the economies to crash and more civil clashes. This was supposed to be the start of bigger and bigger attacks.</p>

<p><em>While the police timeline indicates that six minutes elapsed after security guard Jesus Campos was shot outside Paddock’s hotel room door before Paddock fired his first shots at the crowd, MGM Resorts International managers say they are “now confident” that the timeline is “not accurate.”</em></p>

<p><em>“(After extension negotiation with the FBI&#39;s superiors,) [b]we know that shots were being fired at the festival lot at the same time as, or within 40 seconds after, the time Jesus Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio,” the company, which owns Mandalay Bay, said in a statement.</em></p>

<p><strong>One crucial element missing from the hotel’s statement: What time Campos was shot, as opposed to what time he reported being shot.</strong></p>

<p><em>The company did not give a new estimate of when Campos was shot, and instead said Campos called in the shooting “at the same time as” or “within 40 seconds” of Paddock firing on the crowd, where 58 victims were killed and nearly 500 injured during Paddock’s 10-minute shooting rampage. Las Vegas police were already in the hotel casino responding to another call, and they were “together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos reported that shots were fired over the radio,” the company’s statement said. Then, &quot;These Metro officers and armed Mandalay Bay security officers immediately responded to the 32nd floor.&quot;</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>LOL. Is anyone else beginning to think that all of this timeline jockeying was the FBI trying to tell all the MGM executives who made hundreds of millions short selling their own stock who the real boss is here? As in, &quot;we have complete control of the timeline, and if you don&#39;t play ball with us, we are more than willing to expose your business to hundreds of millions in lawsuits that we are immune from.&quot; </p>

<p>I wonder what the mobsters who run MGM were refusing the mobsters who control the FBI? &quot;Protection&quot; Money? Cooperation in installing their favored (rather than the MGM&#39;s favored) security equipment? Any ideas?</p>

<p>They never lump Campos in with &quot;Mandalay Bay security&quot;. Why else would you word it that way instead if &quot;Campos and other Mandalay Bay security officers&quot;? Maybe nothing, just seemed like the article is very carefully worded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your point is that this isn&#39;t complex. Take for example, you think for example, they can trace his movements at all times, before he committed a crime..</p>

<p>If your GPS is turned off, there&#39;s no recorded location data. Triangulating a location by towers is very inaccurate, and can only be done on the fly. Towers don&#39;t keep running calculations of where you are, period.</p>

<p>They can remotely turn on your GPS with a warrant, but the most obvious proof is simply battery life. If you turn on location tracking, even more specifically with Google, there&#39;s several stages. Location by close hotspots, and using actual satellite to locate your position. Each uses different amounts of battery.</p>

<p>They can tell which tower your phone is connected to, which can give a general direction you&#39;ve gone in.. but it&#39;s accuracy is by miles, not feet.</p>

<p>Most of what you&#39;ve said is based on uninformed idle speculation. Sure, they know more now than they knew before.  And of course they know more than they&#39;ve said. But that doesn&#39;t mean they truly have a complete picture that you&#39;ve tried to claim they have.</p>

<p>And FYI, they put up the billboards asking for tips last week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about his car&#39;s GPS? And who turns off the GPS in their phones?</p>

<p>But fine. If he went to great lengths to disable his car and phone GPS&#39;s (which I will bet you $100 he didn&#39;t), then maybe it is a little harder to track every movement he made. So what? That casts doubt on exactly one sentence of what I wrote!</p>

<p>You dismiss the rest based on what? Nothing but empty rhetoric.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, my premise is your logic, which you just highlighted. You think people don&#39;t turn off their GPS? People don&#39;t want to be tracked? Lol. Even if it&#39;s just to save battery, yes, people turn off their GPS.</p>

<p>And this guy who seemed to be very careful, you&#39;d think he wouldn&#39;t turn them off? A guy who&#39;s about to commit a mass murder? Something he&#39;s been planning for, scouting.. he would somehow not think of this?</p>

<p>No, the rest of what you said ignores how much data they have to sift through, how many warrants they have to get once they get information that gives them reasonable cause to get said warrant.. ignores that we don&#39;t actually know what they know, so we can only speculate on what they know.</p>

<p>Sure, they know more than they&#39;ve said. Your post would have been accurate of that&#39;s all you said.. but it ignored that there&#39;s tons of processes that take time to execute. Maybe now they have most of the answers you claim they have, but they didn&#39;t have that last week.</p>

<p>They look bad each time they release information that conflicts with information they&#39;ve already released, that&#39;s the fuel that keeps the conspiracies going.. even makes more normal people question it. And that, in itself is likely why we&#39;ve heard less and less, because until they can lockdown what&#39;s actually happened, we are left to wonder.</p>

<p>Do I think we will get the truth? At this point, no. This really does seem fishy as fuck. But I think we will get a version of the truth that is mostly true, and enough to make most people stop questioning.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the high possibility that this was extremely well executed, extremely well planned, and extremely difficult to figure out: hence why conspiracy theories are all over the place, just like their investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thinks he was an unwitting patsy. And I think he had a couple of nice phones with long lasting batteries. I would happily bet you $500 that he never turned off his GPS in his phone or in his car, and these facts speaks to his innocence.</p>

<p>Of course, I as pointed out above, the FBI will never tell us one way or the other, and the news stenographers will never dare ask because behaving like a journalist will get a reporter fired these days.</p>
