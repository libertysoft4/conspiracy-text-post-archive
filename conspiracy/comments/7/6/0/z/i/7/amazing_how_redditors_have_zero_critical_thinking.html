<p>They downvote any contradictory information. </p>

<p>They villainize people so viciously like no other subject I can think of. Such anger and hate, using cuss words, all over vaccines that they likely didn&#39;t even receive themselves. </p>

<p>Yet they know little about vaccines in general. They think it&#39;s just pure virus+sterile water or something. They can&#39;t tell you what&#39;s in it. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t know about the MTHFR gene, the safe amount of aluminum, SV40, the aborted fetal cells that serve as vaccine growth medium, the neurological consequences of over-excitation of the immune system, the fact that you can&#39;t sue a vaccine manufacturer, what a VAERS report is, the synergistic effects of combining vaccines, what polysorbate-80 does to the blood brain barrier, none of it.</p>

<p>All they know is the narrative they&#39;ve been fed and they parrot it so well. How did it get this bad? How did tptb rile up so much vitriol in people? </p>

<p>What we SHOULD be angry about is having to inject our kids every two months starting at birth, not knowing what&#39;s behind the needle. And to prevent illnesses like chickenpox? Polio, which went away on its own once we invented indoor plumbing? The flu? Give me a break!</p>

<p>AMA about vaccines.</p>

<p>Um. Considering plumbing preceded the eradication of polio by a huge amount of time; it&#39;s pretty specious to make that claim. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/polio.pdf">Good luck with that claim, fam.</a></p>

<p>The death-to-case ratio for paralytic polio is generally 2%–5% among children and up to 15%–30% for adults (depending on age).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.who.int/biologicals/vaccines/smallpox/en/">And here&#39;s smallpox.</a></p>

<p>Two forms of the disease are recognized, variola minor with a mortality rate of approximately 1%, and the more common variola major with a mortality rate of 30%.</p>

<p>First of all, you gave literally zero info. Zero. You gave us a page with mixed evidence of &quot;vaccines are bad&quot; and &quot;vaccines are good&quot;.

<p>Yeah call me a shill, ignore everything that doesn&#39;t fit your foilhat theory. What&#39;s wrong with basing your opinion on actual evidence?  Something you wouldn&#39;t be familiar with I guess.</p>

<p>You know, just because this is r/conspiracy doesn&#39;t mean every crazy theory is true. In this forum, it&#39;s more important than ever to be sincere and critical. Show me some pub.med articles, not this middle school powerpoint presentation shit. The scientific method is about collecting data, then making a conclusion. What you&#39;re doing is making a conclusion, then looking for data to fit that. That&#39;s now how you do science, in fact it&#39;s the exact opposite of science. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talk about repeating yourself. Everything I have said and believe is backed by evidence which I shared. Yoi have not. I did not call you a shill but if the shoe fits...</p>

<p>Your comments about the articles I shared shows you took no time to look at them at all. There were plenty of scientific papers and studies which you completely ignored </p>

<p>Also, ridiculing &quot;tinfoil hat theories&quot; proves to me you don&#39;t really belong on this site as your mind is already predetermined to believe everything you&#39;ve been spoonfed and taught by those that want to hold us down (i.e. big gov, the pharmaceutical companies, military industrial complex, etc.).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even american... vaccines are a global issue. But thanks for confirming that you jump to conclusions based on nothing.</p>

<p>I love it when people are too proud to admit they are wrong so instead they just double down and stonewall instead. Once again, why would i sill through thousands of articles you haven&#39;t even looked at yourself? Hypocrite.</p>

<p>Like I said, show me one pub.med and I&#39;d gladly look at it. But you can&#39;t, because you have never read such an article. You can&#39;t even show me a single select article, all you can do is refer me to &quot;google it&quot;. I don&#39;t understand how you are even arguing that you presented me with <strong>any</strong> kind of evidence, it&#39;s just not true. </p>

I have read those articles so once again you are assuming something while accusing me of doing so.

<p>It seems all you can do is make assumptions and judgements about my character since you have nothing to offer to this conversation to back up your views on vaccines.

<p>As for pub.med, if you only accept one source for information, that greatly enhances my understanding as to why you are so closed-minded. </p>

<p>I live in Sweden and I can tell you, our country is in no shape or form controlled by the military. In fact, we are probably among the top 5 countries in Europe where the military have the least amount of power and influence in civilian society. Just because Americans are scared of the MIC doesn&#39;t mean other nations have to be, especially in a nation of &lt;10 million where no industry is big enough to influence public opinion directly.</p>

<p>Yes, that certainly explains the confusion here, I had real trouble figuring out what articles you were referring to (as several of the google images articles on the first page ARE pro-vaccine). The only thing you actually did comment on in our comment chain was Polio cases, and you never did link any articles on that. </p>

<p>From your other comments, here&#39;s an excellent example of a credible source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23609067">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23609067</a> (Lo and behold, it&#39;s actually PubMed!). The article contains a lot of reasonable assumptions aside from their attempt to link Aluminum with Autism (vaccines causes autism is based on a hoax experiment and has been debunked hundreds of times, the doctor responsible lost his license for it.). Additionally, one of their big arguments is that a health official testified in court that Aluminum is dangerous for children in 1927. That is the same year that aluminum&#39;s adjuvant effect was discovered. How could he claim to know this less than a year after the effect was discovered? And bear in mind this was 90 years ago, we know much more about the elements than we did then, hell we went to the moon and back during that time.</p>

<p>And this link?
<a href="https://avscientificsupportarsenal.wordpress.com/">https://avscientificsupportarsenal.wordpress.com/</a></p>

<p>Well...... it&#39;s a wordpress article that starts with &quot;There is absolutely undeniable scientific proof that vaccines cause autism. There is no question! Case closed! Game over!&quot; I would take that with a grain of salt. </p>

<p>Same with this one:
<a href="https://healthwyze.org/reports/60-vaccine-secrets">https://healthwyze.org/reports/60-vaccine-secrets</a>
It&#39;s an unprofessional no-name website. Now I&#39;m open to the possibility that what&#39;s said here is true, but if these substances actually ARE in vaccines I&#39;d like to see an official source on those ingredients, not some privately funded website with an unknown agenda. On top of all this, I&#39;d really like to hear an alternate explanation as to WHY they would put &quot;known neurotoxins&quot; in vaccines if not for their beneficial effects? Harming people is in their best interest? Come on.</p>

<p>But in the end you <em>have</em> to admit that linking to a* google image search* of graphs is just unbelievably insincere? I mean if someone tried to pull that on you on a topic you disagree with I guarantee you&#39;d react the same way I did, you&#39;re just blinded by bias in this case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument falls apart at vaccines don&#39;t cause autism. They do in fact cause it as numerous independent (not done by or funded by pharmaceutical companies) scientific studies have shown. In fact, William Thompson, the CDC whistleblower, acknowledged that the CDC had them throw out data that showed otherwise. There was an over 300% likelihood for African American children to become autistic from the MMR vaccine.</p>

<p><a href="http://avoiceforchoice.org/cdcwhistleblower/">http://avoiceforchoice.org/cdcwhistleblower/</a></p>

<p>As for the ingredients, all you have to do is look at the manufactuers ingredients to see these toxins are in them. Here is a list of each vaccine and what is in them. Pick and choose and look for youtself.</p>

<p><a href="https://vaccines.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=005206">https://vaccines.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=005206</a></p>

<p>As far as Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the evidence used to revoke his license was overturned and he is now in the process of getting reinstated. He was essentially proven right as they could not disprove his findings to keep his license revoked.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.autisminvestigated.com/wakefield-medical-license/">http://www.autisminvestigated.com/wakefield-medical-license/</a></p>

<p>Who knows why known harmful neurotoxins and deadly ingredients are added to vaccines. The best guesses are to dumb us down and for population control, not to mention having a weak and defenseless population constantly sick while needing healthcare and remaining dependent on the government. There is a lot of money to be made in keeping us in a perpetual cycle of sickness.</p>

<p>Literally impossible with inactivated vaccines. </p>

<p>There&#39;s very few attenuated vaccines currently in widespread use, and those carry <em>clear</em> instructions to the recipients that they should avoid contact with vulnerable populations until their immunity has settled. </p>

<p>Uh, what? How is that related to my point at all? </p>

<p>It also very specifically depends on the person, their immune system, the type of disease immunized against, and the ongoing attention to boosters. </p>

<p>Vaccines aren&#39;t a perfect cure, they&#39;re <em>part of a systemic public health program</em>. </p>

<p>More importantly, vaccines for children are designed to carry them through the period of their life when they&#39;re most vulnerable. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re immune, as an adult, to lethal childhood diseases. </p>

<p>So far, none of your &#39;arguments&#39; have been anything except &quot;this isn&#39;t entirely perfect!&quot;</p>

<p>No, of course it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s good enough, though, in comparison to the absolute scourge of bullshit humanity used to have to plow through. </p>

<p>There is no such thing as &quot;natural lifetime immunity&quot; full stop, so your entire premise is bullshit. </p>

<p>As for my point of &quot;it isn&#39;t entirely perfect&quot;, when it comes to dealing with my childrens health as well as those I love, injecting them with something shown to be extremely dangerous needs to be 100% perfect and safe, which vaccines are not either.

<p>This false equivalency shit needs to stop. There is no &quot;sides&quot; to science. There is the truth, and then there is <em>lies</em>. I do not spend my time with liars. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t have my best interests at heart. Fortunately, I&#39;m capable of constructing my own motivations for doing things independently of what other people tell me. </p>

<p>My conclusion is that the statistically miniscule chance of side effects from vaccinations are massively outweighed by both the positive personal things vaccination does for me as well as discharging my responsibility to my community. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>there are no safe amounts of mercury and aluminum in any form</p>

<p>You might be shocked to know that this is a bald faced lie! You have mercury and aluminum in you <em>right now</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They accumulate in your body with no way out.</p>

<p>Then how great is it that these aren&#39;t pure metals. They&#39;re <strong>metal salts</strong> that are soluble in water and are mostly passed through you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over multiple doses of multiple vaccines, that&#39;s more than enough accumulated neurotoxins to do damage. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely and fundamentally not true. Not at all. </p>

<p>Not only do most vaccines <strong>not</strong> include any kinds of heavy metal salts, there is a very, very clear and well documented side effect threshhold that none of these (even cumulatively) cross. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Combine that with the amounts added to food and also from what we get from the environment, you are asking for trouble.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering the amount you get from the environment is orders of magnitude larger than a whole regime of vaccinations, it&#39;s clear you don&#39;t even understand basic mathematics, let alone statistics. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please show me where these neurotoxins are considered safe in small doses as I can tell you with 100% certainty they are not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9925236">Here is the MSDS for Thiomersal (a mercury salt phased out of vaccines in 1999)</a>, you will note that that the lethal dose, as listed in section 11, is 75 mg/kg.</p>

<p>You will see, [here], that the average vaccine with Thiomersal has 50 <em>micrograms</em> of the mercury salt in it. </p>

<p>In order to reach a level remotely dangerous to humans (say, 0.1 mg/kg) you&#39;d need two vaccines per kilogram. Which, for an average adult, is about 140 Thiomersal vaccinations before you even begin to enter the threshold of <em>maybe</em> having toxic effects. </p>

<p>Let me remind you of the basic rules of toxicity:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A central concept of toxicology is that the effects of a toxin are dose-dependent; even water can lead to water intoxication when taken in too high a dose, whereas for even a very toxic substance such as snake venom there is a dose below which there is no detectable toxic effect.</p>

<p>Flu shots. My daughter had the flu last winter.

</blockquote>

<p>None of these things. General societal vaccinations are mandatory strictly to establish herd immunity protections against pandemics and/or the immuno compromised. Even when there is a small number of adverse reactions, this is a small price to pay for protection against the much larger danger of transmissable deadly disease. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(what virus do, right?) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong. They don&#39;t always mutate away from the yearly vaccine group. It&#39;s a roughly 50/50 shot, but that saves tens of thousands of lives. The flue is very dangerous, and establishing even basic community protections is a boon. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What gives? Do Dr. Get kickbacks for vaccinations?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, kickbacks are illegal. They get to bury less elderly and infant patients. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, no one has every suggested that vaccines are perfectly safe. They aren&#39;t. Just as seatbelts aren&#39;t perfect in every type of crash. They&#39;re societal average safety tools and we ask everyone to bear the burden of an incredibly tiny margin of risk in order to help their fellows (and themselves). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last year&#39;s shot was about 42% effective, so moderately. About a 30% reduction in hospitalizations, enough to make it cost effective I figure. The CDC and public health agencies are certainly invested in helping push flu shots to everyone because they need vaccine manufacturers to maintain the necessary facilities to scale up vaccine production in the face of a deadlier flu epidemic. Selling a broad number of flu shots every year helps accomplish that. I actually agree with this - epidemics like the Spanish flu were horrific and we need to be prepared to respond to that kind of threat with the vaccine manufacturing ability in place. And, well, I live with members of influenza vulnerable populations. So we all get flu shots in solidarity. Even if I don&#39;t really think I need one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It IS a problem when they tell pregnant women, and all family members of a new baby, to get the shot. Then you hold tiny baby and get your asymtomatic pertussis all over them. Then people wonder how such a tiny baby caught whooping cough. Unlike many other vaccines, the dtap does nothing for herd immunity and provides <a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/07/08/whooping-cough-outbreak.aspx">very little protection from the illness.</a> 
 It&#39;s also one of the worst vaccines on VAERS reports. It&#39;s a shit vaccine. Not all vaccines are equal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just linked you the numbers, while other vaccines might be better it&#39;s far from a shit vaccine. Pregnant women absolutely should get the vaccine, as should your child starting at 2 months. Just because it doesn&#39;t reduce infectivity doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t get the vaccine, it still saves lives, as I&#39;ve already linked above. You don&#39;t have an argument except to emotion, which isn&#39;t an argument at all.</p>

<p>This is a study that the CDC uses to cite the safety of the dtap for pregnant women. Small sample size and no idea how they came to the conclusion they did based on the actual results. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22727350/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22727350/</a></p>

<p>16% rate of spontaneous abortion after the DTaP when given to pregnant women. 58% of women reported an adverse reaction. But since the makers of the study decided that it &quot;wasn&#39;t related to the shot&quot;, they conclude that DTaP is okay during pregnancy LOL</p>

The husband sued for custody based on them violating court order.</p>

<p>That would explain why the person I&#39;m replying to answered as he did. There&#39;s no one forcing you to vaccinate your kids, that&#39;s actually why there&#39;s an increasing risk of seeing these nearly dead diseases make a comeback.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll reply to you since you&#39;re being civil :) </p>

<p>The diagnostic criteria for polio changed around the same time that the rates went down. <a href="http://www.vaccinationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Rise-of-Acute-Flaccid-Paralysis-AFP-and-Fall-of-Polio.jpg">Check out this graph</a> that shows that as the rates of polio went down, the rates of another disease with the same symptoms went up. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a conspiracy that the polio epidemic in the US was actually DDT poisoning, but I don&#39;t have much info on that. </p>

<p>The fact is, mortality rates of polio and most diseases for that matter went down when people stopped shitting in the streets, started washing their hands, and when they implemented child labor laws. It&#39;s not surprising how many kids succumbed to minor illnesses back when they were working 14 hour days in the coal mines with poor nutrition. </p>

<p>You might want to actually read up on the definitions of the fallacies you try to carpetbomb every discussion you take place in with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Appeal to Authority</p>

<p>Description: Using an authority as evidence in your argument when the authority <strong>is not really an authority on the facts</strong> relevant to the argument. </p>

<p>Exception: Appealing to authority is valid when the authority <strong>is actually a legitimate authority on the facts</strong> of the argument. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If my argument was &quot;Your argument against vaccines is dumb, and I know it because I&#39;m a school principal and spend tons of time with vaccinated kids&quot;. <em>that</em> is an appeal to authority, because my the &quot;authority&quot; I&#39;m claiming is not directly related to actually providing me with expertise on the subject.</p>

<p>An appeal to authority is not &quot;Your opinion on vaccines is dumb, and I know it bevause I have 8 years of education on genetic engineering and the development of vaccines that you do not&quot;. That&#39;s called &quot;explaining why you shouldn&#39;t be ranting about something you clearly know nothing about&quot;</p>

Not to mention I went to a co-op university, which meant that I spent 18 months of my undergraduate education, along with various classmates, actually working in the industry at places like GSK, Merck, Pfizer, J&amp;J, etc. Senior year of undergraduate requires a research project involving some kind of tissue or genetic modification experiment.

<p>You&#39;re right, let me get more into detail. </p>

<p>The MTHFR gene: A segment of the population is homozygous for this gene. It interferes with methylation, and you&#39;re often have less glutathione, a chemical in your liver which is important for detoxing. There&#39;s only been one study that I know of, but it showed that children with this gene had an increased rate of adverse reactions after vaccination. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454680">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454680</a></p>

<p>The safe amount of aluminum. Aluminum is used in many vaccines to force an immune response. Only problem is aluminum is incredibly toxic to cells. Here&#39;s a toxicologist who talks about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mxne1v0ZD_0">https://youtu.be/mxne1v0ZD_0</a>
Additionally, what happens if your injected with a vaccine with an aluminum adjuvant, and also a vaccine that does not have an aluminum adjuvant? The aluminum would also work on the other vaccine that doesn&#39;t need it. This could cause all kinds of problems as well. For example here is a study that shows that getting the DTaP with the MMR is a terrible idea. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27840013">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27840013</a></p>

<p>SV40 is a cancer causing virus that used to contaminate polio vaccines. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10472327">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10472327</a> It&#39;s also discussed in detail in the stickied medical conspiracies round table in this sub.</p>

<p>The aborted fetal cells that serve as vaccine growth medium. They gotta grow the virus on something, right? For many vaccines, it&#39;s human cells. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/aborted-fetuses-vaccines/story?id=29005539">http://abcnews.go.com/Health/aborted-fetuses-vaccines/story?id=29005539</a></p>

<p>The fact that you can&#39;t sue a vaccine manufacturer  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court</a></p>

<p>VAERS is the official database to report vaccine adverse reactions. You should file one about your wife&#39;s reaction! It&#39;s estimated that less than 10% of vaccine injuries get reported. </p>

<p>The synergistic effects of combining vaccines. Here&#39;s a doctor who explains it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vRU93kGmbI0">https://youtu.be/vRU93kGmbI0</a></p>

<p>What polysorbate-80 does to the blood brain barrier. Polysorbate-80 is used for cancer treatments to get the chemo into the brain. It&#39;s also used as an emulsifier in many vaccines which is a terrible idea because that lets all the crap in the vaccine into your brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to argue one thing you claimed, sv40 hasn&#39;t been allowed in any vaccine since 1961. The regulations didn&#39;t require they got rid of the contaminated vaccines, but they were all used up by 1963. It&#39;s been a relative non issue for over 50 years. Yes, it happened, and that&#39;s bad, but you&#39;re taking early years of our medical community, pre-ordered technology (for the most part). If you read at the very end in 2002 they recognized it as being very bad, but that was made through the use of technology from what it describes (versus having to test using monkey livers, which was very time consuming, and much less accurate when compared to the newer methods) <a href="http://www.sv40foundation.org/cpv-link.html">http://www.sv40foundation.org/cpv-link.html</a></p>

<p>Another example you gave was a link that shows that getting one vaccine specifically with another is dangerous. But you do realize, doctors know which vaccines can be given with which. There&#39;s many types of vaccine schedules, and any doctor that knows what they&#39;re doing knows which can be given with which.</p>

<p>This article is 8 years old, but does a better job of explaining live vaccines, the bodies response, etc than anything you&#39;ve linked to. <a href="https://www.thenakedscientists.com/articles/questions/can-vaccines-be-given-together">https://www.thenakedscientists.com/articles/questions/can-vaccines-be-given-together</a></p>

<p>The thing that people don&#39;t seem to realize when they make arguments that vaccines are bad.. is how much more prevalent the viruses they&#39;re trying to irradicate used to be. Here&#39;s a simple example <a href="http://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/7f2446096d9ddae1d412adfcd9a3b717.jpg">http://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/7f2446096d9ddae1d412adfcd9a3b717.jpg</a></p>

<p>The highest Spike was nearly 60k cases of polio per year, and the sharp downturn soon as the vaccine was administered should be pretty easy to see. It was nearly eradicated within a few years, and is almost non-existent now. But, even if no one in our country has it, people from other countries that travel here could be carriers, and if there&#39;s enough people not vaccinated, it could become a thing again.</p>

<p>So you can focus on the cancer, or you can focus on the 20-60k people that would have gotten polio every year, for over 50 years. Even if only 10k per year, that&#39;s a half million people with a horrible quality of life with an incurable disease.</p>

<p>Will I possibly die from cancer from something they don&#39;t yet know about in some vaccine at the age of 70? Maybe. But each vaccine has similar figures, where over the years millions of people would be getting the disease, with how many vaccines there are, there&#39;s a huge segment of our country that would be diseased instead if there were no vaccines. Or maybe they&#39;d be dead.</p>

<p>Either way, there&#39;s a clear reason they aren&#39;t bad.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry for the person you responded to, perhaps they need to blow the whistle on whatever doctor/organization immunized their loved one.. but most doctors know what they&#39;re doing, and the negatives most anti vaxers try to point out are like the link I refuted.. not a current issue, just a current scare tactic.</p>

<p>Unless you can prove that any contaminated vaccines were produced in recent years that is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the sv40 virus is likely gone now, which is why I said &quot;used to&quot;. But did you know it infected polio vaccines in Italy up to 1999? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>doctors know which vaccines can be given with which. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they don&#39;t. Most doctors know very little about vaccines except that &quot;they&#39;re safe and effective&quot;. The MMR and DTaP are still often given together at 15 months in the U.S.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s many types of vaccine schedules </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, there&#39;s the CDC schedule. Anyone who tries to go with a delayed or alternate schedule is a crazy anti vaxxer who hates science. </p>

<p>As for your polio/cancer comment, I don&#39;t like the &quot;well cancer is bad but polio is worse&quot; argument. But we can agree to disagree :) I just think if you&#39;re going to give a vaccine, we need to ensure it&#39;s safe. Or at least give people <strong>informed consent</strong>.</p>

<p>You realize they give babies 8 vaccines at a time routinely right? And if the kid needs to &quot;catch up&quot; for whatever reason, it&#39;s not at all uncommon to give them even more. Do you have kids?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I&#39;d like to give my opinion for who&#39;s responsible for shutting down discussion... Anti science Antivaxers are. Why? Because you&#39;re the first person having a discussion on their side that&#39;s not anti science, and more than barely informed. Ever.</p>

<p>The only reason I responded to you at all is because you shared more sources to back up your words, and they weren&#39;t all trying to blame vaccines for everything the medical field can&#39;t explain.</p>

<p>But you see, because I would say almost all Antivaxers take preposterous positions, everyone sane tends to shut down what we&#39;ve decided is a useless point of view. It&#39;s not mindless acceptance, it&#39;s not seeing there may be a third party that actually wants to make a useful educated contribution to a discussion that&#39;s almost exclusively uneducated people.</p>

<p>I mean, look at r/insanepeoplefacebook to see what the average Antivaxers think. It&#39;s truly insane sometimes. My favorite, &quot;my baby just died of x, but at least they didn&#39;t get that horrible vaccine that causes autism (vaccine for x).&quot; There are people dying, and it&#39;s only going to get worse the more the argument is &quot;vaccines are bad!&quot; instead of a more moderate &quot;we should do more research into making sure vaccines are safer.&quot; Which is an argument I&#39;ve yet to hear.</p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t have kids. I don&#39;t have much skin in this game, I stopped replying to anyone who&#39;s obviously uneducated on the matter.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m firmly of the opinion that you&#39;re better served by educating those against vaccines, than blaming the ones who understand the benefits.. that&#39;s the only way you&#39;re going to get a more positive conversation going.</p>

<p>But when all the Antivaxers are looking for are sources that confirm what they want to believe.. you&#39;re not going to gain much ground.</p>

<p>Face it, you&#39;re one of the only voices of reason taking a position more on their side.. a voice drowned by uneducated people who only want to believe things that confirm their beliefs.</p>

There are also a lot of dumb provaxxers though. The &quot;if you don&#39;t vaccinate your kid is gonna get smallpox/rabies and die!&quot; people...uhh newsflash, we don&#39;t routinely vaccinate for that one lol. Stuff like that. </p>

<p>Give the internet a search somewhere other than reddit. You&#39;ll find antivax PEDIATRICIANS coming out of the woodwork, giving interviews on the &quot;vaxxed&quot; bus, stuff like that. Anyway good talk, cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me break this down for you. </p>

<p>The MTHFR gene produces an enzyme, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. When you have some sort of mutation, you essentially have decreased MTHFR enzyme activity. </p>

<p>This enzyme is responsible for converting folic acid (Vit B9) &amp; dietary folate into Methylfolate -- the activated form which the body can use. </p>

<p>Methylfolate is involved in many biochemical processes: 
- Provides the methyl group (-CH3) in cellular methylation reactions [i.e. DNA methylation]
- has a role in the break down of homocysteine
- involved in the production of neurotransmitters [Dopamine, Norepinephrine, &amp; Serotonin]</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you actually even read the details in the study you linked. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2746083/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2746083/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For both studies, the same team of trained physicians and nurses used the same forms to obtain medical history and to record local and systemic AEs after vaccination. Subjects were examined at regular intervals (days 3–5, 6–8, 9–11, 12–15, and 26–30 after vaccination). Local and systemic AEs were recorded. Subjects with an oral temperature of greater than 38.3 °C anytime during the study, <strong>generalized skin eruptions</strong> on non-contiguous areas to the site of vaccination [11], or <strong>enlarged or tender regional lymph nodes</strong> associated with vaccination were defined as those experiencing <em>systemic AEs.</em></p>

<p>[11] Talbot TR, Bredenberg HK, Smith M, LaFleur BJ, Boyd A, Edwards KM. Focal and <strong>generalized folliculitis</strong> following smallpox vaccination among vaccinia-naive recipients. JAMA. 2003;289:3290–3294. [PubMed]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the adverse reactions are: fever, folliculitis, and enlarged lymph nodes. You are citing the study as if these AE&#39;s are bound to kill you. </p>

<p>Now consider the risk/benefit ratio:</p>

<p>Hypothetically, would you rather deal with those bothersome &quot;adverse reactions&quot; </p>

<p>OR not getting vaccinated against meningococcus and risk having your adrenals bleed out?  [Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome]</p>

<p>How about death from an infectious agent (that a vaccine could have prevented) </p>

<p>OR the adverse reactions listed above?! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry about that. I&#39;m not sure what your child is dealing with.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be straight up with you. </p>

<p>I&#39;m in my late 20&#39;s and I&#39;m debating on if I should ever reproduce. I know that folate deficiency during pregnancy causes neural tube defects. I know that I have a risk factor (the MTHFR A1298C mutation, folate deficiency) of having an Autistic child. My mom doesn&#39;t have ADHD, but for some reason I do. Literally found out that we got the mutation from her a year ago. I asked her if she took prenatal vitamins during pregnancy, but she didn&#39;t because she was very anti-medication.</p>

<p>I got diagnosed with ADHD at a young age. I also got diagnosed with a learning disability (dyslexia) in elementary school. It&#39;s not as apparent anymore, it was for years though. I would like to think that I&#39;ve overcome it as I&#39;ve found all sorts of ways to cope and manage my life. But I understand what it&#39;s like to have a disability so don&#39;t get me wrong. I hate the fact that I have to take a damn capsule for over 10 years now. This exogenous chemical has helped me be more &quot;normal&quot; in life per se. I still struggle at times, but I wasn&#39;t going to let it stop me from pursuing my goals. So I can&#39;t imagine what an Autistic child deals with, or what a parent that has a child with Autism. I can understand how scary it is not knowing the direct cause of Autism.</p>

<p>BUT they can&#39;t find a link between autism and vaccines. There are cases of unvaccinated children with autism too. Of course there will be researchers wanting to find that link. Every researcher&#39;s dream is to be the one that discover slinks, associations, effective treatments etc. Biostats is a required course in med school for a reason too. All sorts of errors and biases exist in these studies (especially ones funded by big pharma), but medicine is also peer reviewed. If there was a correlation or legit studies to prove the link, it wouldn&#39;t be swept under the rug.</p>

<p>I know that a MTHFR mutation is a risk factor for miscarriages and autism (depending on variant). I&#39;m also knowledgable on the fact that the  embryological neural tube gives rise to the CNS, and that folate deficiency during pregnancy results in neurological defects. In terms of biochemical metabolic pathways, methyfolate functions to make &quot;SAM&quot; which is necessary for the proper biosynthesis of the MOA neurotransmitters serotonin, epinephrine, and dopamine. </p>

<p>When I found out that I had this mutation, I was a bit relieved. Especially once I started to read about the links to ADHD, learning disabilities etc. SO I understand your interest. </p>

<p>BUT they can&#39;t find a link between autism and vaccines. There are cases of unvaccinated children with autism too. Of course there will be researchers wanting to find that link. Every researcher&#39;s dream is to be the one that discover slinks, associations, effective treatments etc. Biostats is a required course in med school for a reason too. All sorts of errors and biases exist in these studies (especially ones funded by big pharma), but medicine is also peer reviewed. If there was a correlation or legit studies to prove the link, it wouldn&#39;t be swept under the rug.</p>

<p>I know that a MTHFR mutation is a risk factor for miscarriages and autism (depending on variant). I&#39;m also knowledgable on the fact that the  embryological neural tube gives rise to the CNS, and that folate deficiency during pregnancy results in neurological defects. In terms of biochemical metabolic pathways, methyfolate functions to make &quot;SAM&quot; which is necessary for the proper biosynthesis of the MOA neurotransmitters serotonin, epinephrine, and dopamine. </p>

<p>When I found out that I had this mutation, I was a bit relieved. Especially once I started to read about the links to ADHD, learning disabilities etc. SO I understand your interest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t take offense :) no worries! That&#39;s rough having the MTHFR gene and then thinking about pregnancy. Have you looked into taking methylfolate instead of folic acid?</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t trust the mountains of research showing no autism/vaccine link, for a few reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They won&#39;t study completely vaccinated vs completely unvaccinated kids. They won&#39;t study for long term health consequences. The CDC admits this and gives it&#39;s BS reasons why here. <a href="https://imgur.com/3tH4GeG">https://imgur.com/3tH4GeG</a></p>

<ol>
<li>The studies they have done are sketchy. Their &quot;placebos&quot; contain everything in the vaccine except the antigen. How is injecting aluminum and stuff a true placebo? </li>
<li>Corruption. (Remember, we are in r/ conspiracy.) How can ANYTHING the CDC says be trusted, when whistleblowers have come out saying data was manipulated to prevent any inkling of vaccines causing autism? Here&#39;s a congressman on CSPAN testifying about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iTFkf_1sHVQ">https://youtu.be/iTFkf_1sHVQ</a></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize btw. I deleted all my negative comments. I actually do take methylfolate. I try to take half a capsule, once or twice a week because the side effects are interesting [anxiety &amp; vivid dreams]. It has helped with my ADHD symptoms though.</p>

<p>Incredible. The CDC basically deflected the question by offering a vague excuse. Honestly I rarely ever reference the CDC or provide it as a source. I was taught about the immunological mechanisms of vaccinations &amp; infectious diseases by Ph.Ds &amp; MDs that I actually respect. I can understand the concern in regards to how the vaccine is actually manufactured.</p>

<p>Just know that most Doctor&#39;s come from a good place when they recommend vaccinations, because vaccines do save lives. And as I said earlier, it&#39;s way different when you witness ill-stricken patients and have a solid understanding of microbial pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Yeah I understand what you are saying. There is always bound to be corruption in an agency, field of work etc. </p>

<p>Now that I think about it, I&#39;m KINDA that way with the FDA. I used to work in the pharmaceutical world &amp; recall pulling generic drugs off the shelf due to recalls. As much as I hate big pharma, I would rather pay extra for drugs that are manufactured in the states. I just wonder about how companies abroad are regulated efficiently.</p>

<p>My best friend (another med student) was complaining about a new generic MFR that the pharmacy filled. We never heard of the company, so we googled. It was an overseas company that the FDA had already sent warning letters to after issuing many recalls. On top of that, the MFR&#39;s lab failed inspections. </p>

<p>We just both were speechless..just nodded our heads. She called her doctor for another RX &amp; had it filled for brand. It&#39;s definitely mind boggling...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response, and question for you if you don&#39;t mind...what signs should someone look for to ask for mthfr testing? Or should everyone take methylfolate, or is normal folate okay instead of folic acid?</p>

<p>I totally agree that doctors are doing what they think is right. I&#39;m totally pro-doctor and I go to normal physicians, not holistic practitioners. Doctors are good people or else they wouldn&#39;t go into medicine!</p>

<p>Like you, I&#39;m just not trusting of the manufacturing. (The vaccine batches don&#39;t come out homogenous. For example some might only have a few nanograms of genetic material in them, some might have a thousand.)</p>

<p>I never thought about checking into the manufacturer for prescriptions... wow. That&#39;s crazy. Thanks for the heads up!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OH AND BTW I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE GENETIC VARIANTS TO THE mthfr mutation</p>

<p>The one that I have is the A1298C mutation. I&#39;ve had some crazy health issues in my past but I&#39;m not blaming vaccinations for it. My best friend has the MTHFR C677T mutation (WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE ONE THE &quot;STUDY&quot; DISCUSSES). She is petite and tall, we are in our 20&#39;s, same ethnicity (middle eastern if u wanna look up the prevalence). She has to deal with keeping her homocysteine in check -- b/c it&#39;s an independent risk factor for causing a stroke, blood clot or cardiovascular disease. She already has had an episode of a TIA IN HER 20&#39;s, that is her fuckin worry. Stop using mutations you know nothing of to justify your rhetoric. WE DON&#39;T NEED U TO BE OUR REDDIT SPOKESPERSON. GOT IT?! We aren&#39;t over here moping around because of health issues we have overcome. Thanks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever helps you sleep at night. I want you to know that I&#39;m a huge critic of big pharma. I&#39;m aware of their tactics &amp; I&#39;m not a fan of corporate America in general.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not the only medical student that is aware btw. I&#39;m also aware of the overprescribing of patented drugs for profit. It&#39;s definitely unethical, I don&#39;t think it will be a norm in the future. Many regulations are being placed on doctors in terms of prescribing. We are taught that we aren&#39;t allowed to accept any sort of gift (including money). </p>

<p>At the same time you are promoting an agenda that is a bit extreme &amp; concerning to me. In the real world, I do witness various cases I&#39;ve studied in pathology textbook. </p>

<p>Besides viruses (which aren&#39;t &quot;living organisms&quot;), If you understand the phylogenetic tree of life, you know we aren&#39;t the only species in this ecosystem. Microbes have existed way longer than we have. They are so evolved to a point where they have the ability to rapidly mutate to adapt to new environments. </p>

<p>Evolution is all about survival, don&#39;t ever forget that. While we do have a symbiotic relationship with some microbes, we can&#39;t forget about the pathogenic ones that are able to evade our immune system (&amp;/or) invade our organ system. </p>

<p>A small organism that can&#39;t be seen has the ability to kill our species. Doesn&#39;t that make you a bit worried? EACH opportunity they have to replicate, they can mutate. As time goes on, they have the ability to one up us and become more pathogenic. </p>

<p>What is your solution? Do we just continue to allow this to happen? There are many dangerous microbes that don&#39;t even have a vaccine. There are some that are so evolved that a vaccine can&#39;t be created in 2017. </p>

<p>How do we find a way to protect ourselves against these &quot;super-microbes?&quot; I think everyone tends to focus on the vaccine aspect without focusing on the evolution &amp; pathogenesis of microbes. </p>

<p>What is so wrong with finding a way to build up an immune response to protect us from one less pathogen?! We know smallpox has been  eradicated by vaccines. Clearly, it worked to eliminate a virus that was detrimental to our health and technically a threat to our species. So why do we believe that it can&#39;t work for other dangerous, deadly microbes? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on the government getting involved and making vaccines mandatory. Not a fan of government intervention myself. I’m not one to push a mandatory vaccination agenda, even though I believe vaccines are important. I’m into conspiracies &amp; I value free speech.</p>

<p>But I’m saying you are being extreme bc I feel that you are missing the other side of the story, which is all the reasons why we do vaccinate.  </p>

<p>While I don’t know everything in life, If there was any sort of doubt in my mind about a vaccination conspiracy, I would be vocal about it myself.</p>

<p>But it’s worrisome to me and many other medical professionals when people aren’t afraid of diphtheria, for instance. While there aren’t many cases anymore because of vaccination and herd immunity, it’s absolutely not an infection you want. You could die from airway obstruction because of cervical adenopathy or suffocation after swallowing the thick pseudomembrane in the back of your throat. Or you could have widespread inflammation of the lungs causing the loss lung function. Or even scarier is the paralysis of the diaphragm. Not sure why anyone would risk not being able to breathe on their own and having to rely on a ventilator.  Imagine having multiple of these symptoms at once. Why put you or your child in a position where death is more likely to be the outcome over recovery. If your lungs don’t function well, your heart won’t function as well either. Not to mention the risk of arrhythmia or heart block due to the diphtheria toxin invading your myocardial cells leading to myocarditis.</p>

This article uses the CDC&#39;s own info to make its case:  <a href="http://www.getholistichealth.com/39215/vaccines-did-not-save-us-2-centuries-of-official-statistics/">http://www.getholistichealth.com/39215/vaccines-did-not-save-us-2-centuries-of-official-statistics/</a></p>

<p>If you&#39;re just looking at what&#39;s between the &quot;<a href="http://www.">www.</a>&quot; and the &quot;.com&quot; and judging from there, you won&#39;t get very far, e.g., most truth on the internet is coming from independent researchers; the AMA and CDC most commonly publish studies that are funded by the drug companies. Would you consider those to be reliable sources? Smart researchers and physicians lose their careers over this shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It amazes me how strong the effect of the propaganda is on this topic.  Just how much hate and ridicule there is for anyone questioning any part of it, no matter what evidence they might present.  &quot;Those anti-science retards!&quot;</p>

<p>To me, the point that easily shows the problem is that an entire class of injections is trusted absolutely just by the application of the vaccine label.  If you can&#39;t make the distinction that the effects of the contents of each specific needle matter, then how can you be approaching the topic with anything other than blind faith?</p>

<p>This is the effect of the lie that is too big.  If vaccines are actually a problem, then the world view of people that have faith in them is incorrect, so they must be safe.  Logic and rational thought are short circuited by seeing ahead to a proposed conclusion which will lead to social exclusion.  As a group, human beings really can be lead to believe anything as long as the propaganda campaign is consistent, long term and all encompassing.  </p>

<p>You probably believe in magic bullets the world being flat and chemtrails too. As you get older the effects of everything around you bombarding your genes cause birth defects like autism, along with people who just plain are genetically incompatible creating mutations that cause problems . </p>

<p>The abundant over misdiagnosis of aspergers and autism to sell medication when the ADD/ADHD scam fell apart is spreading a wave of fear through the ready consumers of fake news and riling them up into eating only watermelons for a week to get healthy and jamming cartons of lemonade up their asses to cure all of their supposed ills.</p>

<p>If your kid gets autism right around the time you are able to detect symptoms it is because you are genetically damaged/inferior not because of a vaccine. Take responsibility for your own problems stop looking for a scapegoat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly my point one guy used some cells of a virus that happened to be growing in the fetus of a child that died as a result of the rubella virus being present in the mother. WI-38. They don&#39;t use fetus anythings. Other vaccines also contain human DNA because believe it or not we need to vaccinate ourselves against viral strains that affect humans and not sheep or ducks or squirrels. So yes the host of the virus used to create the vaccine will have some type of genetic signature in the DNA of the virus due to the mechanism on how which viruses work and reproduce. OP is a methhead. Do not encourage. They don&#39;t make any vaccines with aborted fetuses ever. Never did. They took cells from one in 1961. That and one other example I forget right now. But that isn&#39;t any different than saying they scraped the new syphillis vaccine from a hobos foreskin.

    <div class="md"><p>no they dont because the blood type of the fetus that they took the sample from wouldnt protect everyone so they took the virus from the tissues and then grew it in a sterile media and modified it so that it would die at 86 degrees instead of like 104 degrees and also fixed it so it would trigger all people immune systems to create an antibody in response. </p>

<p>They do not use fetal/fetus tissues in current production of the vaccines ....ever....any of them. At all. No matter what. </p>

<p>Maybe you are a closet christian. </p>

<p>There is a real place for a religious objection to vaccines because the original virus used to create the vaccine did come from a fetus that did not make it to term.</p>

<p>But that is the only reasonable objection on those grounds, in relation to fetus being in vaccines.</p>

<p>They do not grow new vaccines in fetal anythings. You are misinformed or deliberately spreading false information.</p>

<p>You really want to beleive that there is someone just jarring up fetus juice and using it to make vaccines. </p>

<p>Agar (from algae meat soybean protein corn chicken eggs) and many other things are used as a sterile medium. </p>

<p>They took blood from a fetus in 1968, that blood had a virus in it. They put that blood in a petry dish and grew it on a sterile media. They use the same rubella sample that was harvested in 1968.</p>

<p>And they dont need fetuses to keep replenishing it. This isnt southpark this is real life. Here is a site where you can buy all sorts of media. <a href="http://www.culturemediasupplies.com/media.html">http://www.culturemediasupplies.com/media.html</a> </p>

<p>None of it is made from Fetuses. Sheeps cows and pigs but not people. Using fetal tissue in that Manner in the United States would be Illegal under federal law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP how much research have you done about the pros of vaccination? Are you in the medical field? Often people are mislead because they only search the cons and therefore have a false conclusion about vaccines. We&#39;ve had plumbing before polio was eradicated. That is not a sound claim. Vaccines have benefits that far outweigh any cons they may have. People assume they don&#39;t need vaccines because of herd immunity (being safe from infection of a disease because others around you are vaccinated. Thus, they cannot spread the disease to you), but if enough people stop being vaccinated, then herd immunity is no longer an option.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all fun and games to play vaccine conspiracy until you kill someone&#39;s kid because your kid got sick and theirs couldn&#39;t be vaccinated. Many children rely on herd immunity if they are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed from cancer treatments. How old are you? I would be willing to bet if you are a senior citizen who has first hand seen what polio does and how the vaccine saved people, you wouldn&#39;t be trying to poke holes in that story. </p>

<p>Ultimately you&#39;re entitled to your own opinion, but I encourage you to look at the overwhelming evidence of vaccines being safe and helpful. You need to understand that your anti-vaccination beliefs could potentially kill someone who doesn&#39;t have the luxury of being vaccinated. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good article about an anti-vaxxer mom who realized she was wrong and changed her mind. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/abcnews.go.com/amp/Health/anti-vaxxer-mom-mind-kids-fall-ill/story%3Fid=42351543">https://www.google.com/amp/abcnews.go.com/amp/Health/anti-vaxxer-mom-mind-kids-fall-ill/story%3Fid=42351543</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The debate needs to be kept in the INFORMED CONSENT category.</p>

<p>Efficacy should not be the issue. The issue should be that you are the one who controls what is put in your body and the bodies of your children, NOT THE GOVERNMENT. Vaccines are just a medicine, good or bad is for you to decide, whether you inject it into your body or your children or not is for you to decide, not the motherfucking medical establishment, not a bunch of government employees, YOU. Informed consent is already established in law (in Canada it is anyway) and mandatory vaccination violates the Nuremberg Code on a global level. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it before and I will say it again, Mandatory Vaccination is a violation of your right to informed consent and is illegal. That is why we have all this propaganda on the front page of reddit, imgur, and pinterest, because only through social engineering can they continue to push this bullshit &quot;medicine&quot; on us. It is completely 1984ish and they have recruited the masses to push their message by using social media in this manner.</p>

<p>Read the inserts before injecting anything into yourself or your children. The manufacturer&#39;s product inserts tell you everything you need to know and all the risks that you will be taking.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking into which vaccines are more worth it and which aren&#39;t, here&#39;s a good podcast by a pediatrician that&#39;s unbiased in my opinion. <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/user-507883655/6-dr-paul-thomas-interview-how-to-end-the-autism-epidemic">https://m.soundcloud.com/user-507883655/6-dr-paul-thomas-interview-how-to-end-the-autism-epidemic</a></p>

<p>If you want to learn about how vaccines harm in general, I recommend Dr. Suzanne Humphries&#39;s YouTube channel. The lectures can be kind of boring so maybe just listen in the background while you&#39;re doing chores or something. </p>

<p>And hit me up any time you have questions! You might want to try and find a pediatrician that is cool with delayed/no vax, because the provax ones get really pushy. </p>

<p>The MTHFR gene: A segment of the population is homozygous for this gene. It interferes with methylation, and you&#39;re often have less glutathione, a chemical in your liver which is important for detoxing. There&#39;s only been one study that I know of, but it showed that children with this gene had an increased rate of adverse reactions after vaccination. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454680">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454680</a></p>

<p>The safe amount of aluminum. Aluminum is used in many vaccines to force an immune response. Only problem is aluminum is incredibly toxic to cells. Here&#39;s a toxicologist who talks about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mxne1v0ZD_0">https://youtu.be/mxne1v0ZD_0</a>
Additionally, what happens if your injected with a vaccine with an aluminum adjuvant, and also a vaccine that does not have an aluminum adjuvant? The aluminum would also work on the other vaccine that doesn&#39;t need it. This could cause all kinds of problems as well. For example here is a study that shows that getting the DTaP with the MMR is a terrible idea. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27840013">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27840013</a></p>

<p>The aborted fetal cells that serve as vaccine growth medium. They gotta grow the virus on something, right? For many vaccines, it&#39;s human cells. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/aborted-fetuses-vaccines/story?id=29005539">http://abcnews.go.com/Health/aborted-fetuses-vaccines/story?id=29005539</a></p>

<p>The fact that you can&#39;t sue a vaccine manufacturer  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court</a></p>

<p>VAERS is the official database to report vaccine adverse reactions. You should file one about your wife&#39;s reaction! It&#39;s estimated that less than 10% of vaccine injuries get reported. </p>

<p>The synergistic effects of combining vaccines. Here&#39;s a doctor who explains it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vRU93kGmbI0">https://youtu.be/vRU93kGmbI0</a></p>

<p>What polysorbate-80 does to the blood brain barrier. Polysorbate-80 is used for cancer treatments to get the chemo into the brain. It&#39;s also used as an emulsifier in many vaccines which is a terrible idea because that lets all the crap in the vaccine into your brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Had to respond one last time due to your hypocritical comments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Haha, right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Never said you were American...</p>

<p>your mind is already predetermined to believe everything you&#39;ve been spoonfed and taught by those that want to hold us down (i.e. big gov, the pharmaceutical companies, military industrial complex, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, so why would I be spoonfed by the military industrial complex if I&#39;m not american?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>those articles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What articles? Every single one? Yeah... And you still can&#39;t link me a single one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for pub.med, if you only accept one source for information, that greatly enhances my understanding as to why you are so closed-minded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was an example of a credible publisher, it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be pub-med, but once again the subtlety slipped right past you because you were already determined to interprent my comment in your way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems all you can do is make assumptions and judgements about my character since you have nothing to offer to this conversation to back up your views on vaccines. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s funny considering your original comment &quot;attacked&quot; the other guy as much as I&#39;m &quot;attacking&quot; you, you&#39;re being condescending towards him for no reason other than to stroke your own ego. Aside from that, when did I ever attack your character other than saying you&#39;re not using critical thinking? If you want to take my attack on your argument as personal then that&#39;s not my problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>have presented articles supporting why I am not wrong in my beliefs, and once again you are making assumptions about me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You haven&#39;t taken a stance towards any of the articles on the page you linked, in fact like half of them are pro-vaccination, how am I supposed to know which articles you agree with or not? Do you want me to write an essay on each article, only for you to reply with &quot;that&#39;s not the article I meant&quot; on every single one? You once again are unable to provide even a single select article, because you&#39;re clueless about the subject and can&#39;t tell a credible article from one written by Alex Jones.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You deflect away from anything I have said that you can&#39;t refute by criticizing me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can I deflect something you&#39;ve said when all you&#39;ve been saying is that you&#39;ve shared &quot;articles&quot; with me, my first argument stands 4 comments later. Show me a single credible article instead of linking me to a page listing every blogspot article in the world with the words &quot;Polio&quot; and &quot;graph&quot; in it  on the biggest search engine in the world?</p>
