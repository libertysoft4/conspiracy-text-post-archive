        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is there any proof it&#39;s human related? I know the ppm of CO2 has increased to upwards of 450 ppm, but Greenland ice cores show that the warming is natural. See, the ocean is a CO2 sink, so when it heats, it releases CO2, and when it cools CO2 is absorbed. What I&#39;m asking is, the Greenland Ice cores show that in the past 10,000 years earth has been warming and cooling in an oscillating manner, so what&#39;s the evidence that our current CO2 trend is related to human activity, and not just that we&#39;re in a natural period of warming of the earth? Furthermore, is there any proof that CO2 influences temperature? It clearly didn&#39;t factor during the Jurassic period, when CO2 ppm was 4k and glaciers still formed.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/bA7iQ">Here&#39;s</a> an example.  </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/OPuRziy">Here</a> is a picture of the warming and cooling trends since the younger dryas.  </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;d also like to know how they&#39;re linking CO2 increases in our atmosphere to fossil fuel burning. They&#39;re only piece of evidence is that CO2 hasn&#39;t hit 400ppm in the last few hundred thousand years. But that obviously means it HAS been higher than it is now, just not recently. So what is really supporting this claim that we cause it?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that guy doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about, and he&#39;s getting confused.</p>

<p>First, there&#39;s the sea ice and land ice.  Sea ice is collapsing. That&#39;s what we usually talk about when we talk about the Antarctic ice sheet.</p>

<p>As for the land ice, a lot of right wingers seized on a study that had nothing to do with global warming.  In short, snow falls in the Antarctic interior.  As it compresses over millennia, the lower layers of snow eventually compact into ice.  This ice then slowly flows along the ground out and into the sea.</p>

<p>Recently, scientists revised up their estimate of how much snow had fallen in Antarctica over the last 10,000 years or so and the rate this snow had compacted into ice, meaning that when you run the numbers, the new ice this process was generating probably outweighed the increased melting due to global warming.</p>

<p>Note that this had <em>nothing to do with global warming measurements in the recent past.</em>  It had to do with revising millennia long estimates of snowfall and the compacting process.</p>

<p>I&#39;m unclear what you&#39;re saying -- even in a warmer globe, there can still be glaciers in places.  I&#39;m also not sure where you&#39;re getting that 4000 ppm figure from.</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that in the present day, we&#39;re talking about changes over the course of dozens or hundreds of years, and we just don&#39;t have that level of resolution for events hundreds of millions of years ago. I&#39;m really not sure what specific periods you&#39;re talking about when atmospheric carbon went up and temperatures went down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you serious? I just told you, a moment ago.  </p>

<p>CO2 is a greenhouse gas, meaning it absorbs solar radiation -- the more CO2 in the atmosphere, the less solar radiation striking the earth gets reflected back into space.  That trapped solar radiation becomes heat, which raises the atmospheric temperature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where is the evidence that it&#39;s CO2 causing the temperature hike? As I&#39;ve said before, earlier in history the CO2 levels were way higher, so why wasn&#39;t the temperature way higher? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The temperature was higher!  Like I said, on average, the Jurassic had 130% higher CO2 concentration and was three degrees hotter.  Three degrees is a <em>TON</em> of heat when you&#39;re talking about the planet as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course three degrees is a large increase, but are you sure it can be linked to the high levels of CO2? I obviously get the correlation you&#39;re making but you need to have several clear cut examples of temperature increase due to CO2 concentration. Just because the temperature was 3 degrees higher doesn&#39;t mean CO2 was the only factor contributing to it, if even at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, first, here&#39;s an <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/global-warming/temperature-change">NOAA splash page</a> regarding the correlation between CO2 and temperature in ice cores looking back about 400,000 years.  It links to the original studies. No, this can&#39;t prove causation over correlation -- though the existence of a known causal mechanism increases the possibility of that link.</p>

<p>Also, I think you&#39;re asking the wrong question.  The question isn&#39;t, &quot;Can we be 100% certain nothing else is causing our current warming.&quot;  Of course we can&#39;t be.  But the more appropriate question is, &quot;What odds are we willing to risk on the possibility that our current emissions are causing global warming.&quot;  Say it&#39;s only 20% chance human beings are causing global warming, and a 50% the consequences of warming are as bad or worse as predicted.  That&#39;s still a 10% of catastrophe.  Would you board a plane that had a 10% of crashing? </p>

<p>The question isn&#39;t &quot;Are we absolutely certain?&quot;  It&#39;s &quot;Are we reasonably certain enough of the possibility that we should mitigate the risk.&quot;</p>

<p>Why pick on such a minor player like CO2 which isn&#39;t toxic and is vital to plant life. In fact the more CO2 in the atmosphere the less water and the bigger all plant life will simply get, which is why greenhouse gardeners pump extra CO2 into their greenhouses to save on water and get higher yields at the very same time.</p>

<p>Yes, those all produce greenhouse effects as well.  (Though moisture also collects into clouds which increase the planet&#39;s albedo)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why pick on such a minor player like CO2 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it&#39;s the one that&#39;s massively increased due to human activity over the last century, although other gasses such as methane have as well</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Truth is no one is talking about the clearcutting of the rainforests and the poisoning of the oceans that continues unabated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty much all of the people worried about climate change are worried about these things too -- they&#39;re also connected, in that cutting and burning rainforests destroys a major carbon sink, and one of the reasons the ocean is acidifying is the increased dissolution of atmospheric carbon into carbonic acid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s human or not. The problem is this rate of change is unprecedented in the entire history of our planet, and this rate of change will have dramatic consequences on the biome. It could be 50, 100, 150 years, but there it is pure chemistry and physics that more atmospheric CO2 equals more warming.</p>

<p>I mean, OP is arguing against grade-school level chemistry for some reason. Increase in CO2 =&gt; Increase in atmospheric temperatures. It&#39;s why CO2 is called a greenhouse gas.</p>

<p>From there you can speculate what the cause is. It&#39;s odd that the increase starts at the beginning of the industrial revolution and continues throughout our continued use of fossil fuels, and continued destruction of forests.</p>

<p>Carbon is the same thing as pollution</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m glad you brought up an often-used propaganda trick that attempts to make carbon a synonym for pollution.</p>

<p>But isn&#39;t it weird that when you think about it, a carbon tax doesn&#39;t address 99.999% of all pollutants? Instead it focuses on what humans exhale and that plants breathe?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it weird that &quot;climate scientists&quot; are often found fabricating data?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it weird that in this climate tax scenario, the global banks like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the ones who have been designated as stewards of the carbon tax system?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it weird that if the world was about to end, the government wouldn&#39;t invest in breakthrough renewable energy for the people, but instead implement a carbon system that lets all the bug emitters continue emitting, as long as they pay a tax - a tax that will immediately trickle down to the end consumer?</p>

<p>You&#39;d think they&#39;d be launching a new Manhattan project for new energy, but nope, instead they&#39;re doing the &quot;Paris agreement&quot; which will, at best, reduce temperatures by less than one degree (inconsequential).</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for giving me the opportunity to raise these important questions with our audience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The causal link is that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and greenhouse gases trap heat. There is a direct correlation between an increase in greenhouse gases and temperature. The CO2 molecule holds heat; heat that is converted from UV light. The more atmospheric CO2, the higher the atmospheric temperatures.</p>

<p>Greenhouse gases also stay in the atmosphere, CO2 stays for about 40-60 years. This has a compounding effect as you release more and more into the air.</p>

<p>You cannot compare the Jurassic era with the Anthropocene. If we were to go from now -&gt; Jurassic conditions in 200 years, it wouldn&#39;t just spontaneously look like the Jurassic period. It would be a wasteland and desertification, and then <em>maybe</em> after another 200 million years you&#39;d get back to it.</p>

<p>I pulled out a quote, and it&#39;s a very interesting topic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rate at which surface temperatures go up is not proportional to the rate of CO2 emissions, but to the total amount of atmospheric CO2 added since the start of the industrial revolution. Only by looking at long-term trends - 30 years is the standard period in climate science - can we measure surface temperature increases accurately, and distinguish them from short-term natural variation.</p>

<p>We did come out of a cooling period (the LGM) and since the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Younger_Dryas">Younger Dryas</a>, global temperatures have been relatively steady (i.e. no indication of changing). But changes in climate do occur, and thanks to past changes we&#39;re now aware of various planetary cycles - none of which are known to be causing a warming trend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Greenhouse effect of CO2 has been well established since the 19th Century.  Here is the paper Arrhenius wrote in 1996 called, &quot;On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf">http://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf</a></p>

<p>You can read a conference paper where infrared radiation of gases, and their influence on the environment is explored here:</p>

<p><a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/Annual2006/techprogram/paper_100737.htm">https://ams.confex.com/ams/Annual2006/techprogram/paper_100737.htm</a></p>

<p>While the temperature of the ocean is one variable of  co2 dissolution, another one is the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2.  Your objections are rooted in a false dichotomy which is either climate change is man made or it is natural.  No one actually holds that view, and a lot of the research is concerning the demarcation line.    There are many variables which account for climate temperature, the sun&#39;s output is not constant, earths distance to the sun is variable, atmospheric concentrations of gases are variable, volcanic activity can have drastic effects, ocean currents, etc.    All of this is rigorously studied and being modeled.   For example you brought up a glaciation event in the Jurassic, but failed to read up that it is believed to be the results of volcanic activity and changing ocean currents. </p>

<p>None of this really undermines the fact that CO2 is a variable, and one that human beings are affecting. </p>

<p>We are dealing with an inductive discipline, as such there is never going to be proof of anything.  What there is is data, and hypothesis built that explain that data that are informed by general principles from physics and chemistry.   </p>

<p>While ocean temperatures play a part in the carbon cycle, so do other natural processes.  Biomass being one other example, human activity utilizing fossil fuels being another.  Partial pressure of atmospheric c02 also influences the amount dissolved.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rising amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is &quot;an effect&quot; that results from naturally occurring periodic warming cycles, not and never the cause of them. </p>

<p>During warm periods on the planet, plant and animal life dramatically proliferates and expands releasing many times more CO2 into the atmosphere that doesn&#39;t diminish when things eventually get colder or in any way lessen the intensity or shorten the duration of those cold periods. </p>

<p>In fact, if anything CO2 is a first class &quot;refrigerant&quot; that keeps and prolongs those periods of moderate to severe cold, not an insulator that traps or preserves any of the previous warmth to diminish or shorten any of them.</p>

<p>That was all common knowledge prior to the sudden &quot;Global Warming&quot; agenda being launched and make no mistake it was strictly a social and political agenda that was willing to deny all of the existing science and historical evidence in favour of a radical and falsified model in order to re-direct billions of dollars into further research as long as it agreed with the proposition that global warming was real and due strictly to human activity and and huge public awareness campaigns to pave the way for a global carbon credit trading system which would trap the general public in all of the industrialized nations into annually paying billions of dollars for the excess CO2 their industries and their own heating and transportation requirements produced in order to buy credits off countries with little to no industrialization, harsh winter conditions, or simply more physical and difficult terrain and geography to have to contend with. </p>

<p>Billions those countries receiving them would have to provide exactly nothing of any real value in return for receiving them.</p>

<p>Taken to a global scale, what the brokers who would buy, sell, trade and manage the exchange of those credits between countries would earn in commissions would exceed what they presently make in all of the other markets combined, and that of course, was the end goal. It&#39;s also where all the money behind the push and in paying-off the politicians to get on side with it happens to come from.</p>

<p>the Greenland Ice cores show that in the past 10,000 years earth has been warming and cooling in an oscillating manner,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is like Carbon Dating.  It&#39;s a voodoo science that can&#39;t be proven that it works considering our very minuscule use of the science and the fact that there aren&#39;t any records to go by that are 10,000 years old to validate the science so I would take ice core samples with a grain of salt. </p>

<p>But what about Global Warming?  Global Warming might be a thing if HUGE money wasn&#39;t involved in this.  I might believe Global Warming if all the world wanted to do was to recognize Global Warming and then do something about it but I find it hard to believe when <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carbon_credit.asp">Carbon Credits</a> are involved.</p>

<p>And Carbon Credits are what the public knows about.  There are probably international laws set forth due to &quot;Global Warming&quot; that monetarily affects every citizen on the planet that the general public doesn&#39;t even know about.  If this sounds crazy, ask yourself why the international community were so outraged when Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord.  It&#39;s because <strong>A LOT</strong> of money is involved in &quot;Global Warming&quot; and Trumped fucked it up for all the wealthy people when he pulled out of the Accord.  </p>

<p>Humans breath out CO2.  What&#39;s next?  A tax on the human body because we emit a &quot;Greenhouse Gas&quot;?</p>

<p>And the thing that should tell you that this is all a sham is that it&#39;s not even called Global Warming anymore.  &quot;They&quot; had to change it to &quot;Climate Change&quot; because there were too many smart people pointing out that the earth hasn&#39;t actually been warming so they had to call it something else.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, basically, any chaotic system won&#39;t move smoothly -- it&#39;ll bounce above and below the underlying trend line.  So, fossil fuel lobbyists came up with the concept of the &quot;pause&quot; -- find a randomly low year, where it falls below the trend line, work backwards to the last year it was that cool, and pretend there&#39;s a &quot;pause&quot; with no warming.  </p>

<p>Is there any ACTUAL, observable, provable link between CO2 levels and temperature increase?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great article that summarizes this topic: <a href="https://skepticalscience.com/co2-temperature-correlation.htm">https://skepticalscience.com/co2-temperature-correlation.htm</a></p>

<p>I pulled out a quote, and it&#39;s a very interesting topic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rate at which surface temperatures go up is not proportional to the rate of CO2 emissions, but to the total amount of atmospheric CO2 added since the start of the industrial revolution. Only by looking at long-term trends - 30 years is the standard period in climate science - can we measure surface temperature increases accurately, and distinguish them from short-term natural variation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THat&#39;s not the crux of the argument at all. It&#39;s a fact that an increase in CO2 in an environment will increase the temperature of it. That is if its under the same conditions.</p>

<p>Then you talk about &quot;the pause&quot; which shows you just read mainstream garbage.</p>
