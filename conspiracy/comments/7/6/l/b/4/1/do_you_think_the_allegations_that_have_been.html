    <div class="md"><p>This is such a bad post dude. No offense. No, the allegations that have been raised against Weinstein do <em>not</em> prove Pizzagate is real. You know that. However, the fall of Hollywood might lead to the fall of Washington, if these pedo scandals get out. As many have said, Washington is Hollywood for ugly people. If this were to happen, it would prove Pizzagate is real; the idea that there is a pedophile ring in the nation&#39;s capital, which isn&#39;t too far-fetched.</p>

<p>Comet Ping Pong, the pizza place you are referring to, was linked with all of it at some point but it was not random. Internet sleuths found a connection between DC elites and the pizza place, which happened to be the owner, James Alefantis. Alefantis was the former boyfriend of David Brock, and was named one of fifty most powerful people in DC. Some of the things that were discovered which made Comet Ping Pong a major point of focus were musical acts that made disturbing references as well as an Instagram account which had disturbing pictures of children (with captions just as bad).</p>

<p>This will come off as condescending, but you seem to have only heard the MSM spin on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve been researching and watching videos on Pizzagate for a long time now. That may seem like bullshit since I didn’t seem to know where it originated but I do. I misspoke, sorry. Ive read the emails with all the code language and the “handkerchief” code. I’ve seen the Instagram photos and it’s sick. I know just about everything there is to know about Pizzagate. However, back to my original point... I don’t think Weinstein has any sort of direct connection to Pizzagate but I do certainly think he has a lot to do with child trafficking in Hollywood just as every other elite and well known Zionist.</p>

<p>This code language referred to &quot;pizza&quot; and other foods which is actually verified pedo code language. The term &quot;cheese pizza&quot; has been around for a while.</p>

<p>I always see around Pizzagate how it&#39;s &quot;verified&quot;. How is it verified. Frankly from someone outside it looks like someone just replaced pizza slang with pedophilia and used that to make connections. Most normal people love pizza, and while I&#39;m not a fan I&#39;ve met many who like the plain cheese.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s go a long way if someone clearly demonstated how it&#39;s verified, hopefully by some concrete sources like past pedophilia rather than a 4chan anon.</p>

<p>The pizza terminology is not just used by pedos at this point anymore on the dark web. The broader more basic terms, ie &quot;cheese pizza&quot; aka &quot;CP&quot; (are you following why they use that term?), are used in many other dark web communities to warn people against posting such material.

I&#39;m looking for the source evidence where pedophilia is directly tied with pizza terminology. The most I could find is c.p. was used in chat boards. Like you mentioned cheese pizza for c.p.</p>

<p>I could not find any evidence for cheese pizza being used for that context. Specifically I&#39;m looking for evidence of code than emails, rather than emails and a code being made to fit them. Since all of the emails are based on already using the code it isn&#39;t independant for analysis. </p>

<p>You had me intrigued by listing the code as already verified pre emails. However it seems I cannot get you to divulge who and how it was verified. Thus goodbye and have a good day/night.</p>
