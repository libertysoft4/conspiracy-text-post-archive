        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m a colleague of @LauraLoomer, who is jointly investigating the Las Vegas Shooting.</p>

<p>I need your help running this lead down:</p>

<p>I was told today by a Vegas gun store owner that earlier this year 2800 new cameras were installed at the Mandalay Bay hotel, and they were paid for by a joint terrorism grant from the DHS. In exchange for paying for the cameras, mounts and installation the DHS retained access to the footage from any of the cameras and the ability to tap into them directly from an off site location. </p>

<p>The source added that 2200 cameras were also installed at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino and 3900 cameras at the MGM Grand. </p>

<p>The source noted that these purchase orders/bids should be searchable on <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/">https://www.fbo.gov/</a> , between January 2017 &amp; April 2017 time period. Installation would have occurred before summer 2017</p>

<p>Thank you ahead of time, and God Bless.</p>

<p>Message me on here if you want to share info privately by phone/email or DM @LauraLoomer (though she is pretty overwhelmed with messages at the moment and may not respond right away)</p>

<p>Why do you need proof? How is that relevant to the to matter?</p>

<p>OP asked for help tracking down a lead that may or may not be credible.</p>

<p>Either the DHS paid for the cameras and access or they didn&#39;t. If they did, Why? And Why at these specific hotels?</p>

Even large mfg are having a hard time keeping up with standard demand for surveillance equipment; a 10k camera order would take months to trickle in. The low voltage laws in Las Vegas require all low voltage cabling to be in conduit; that is a ton of conduit to install. You can&#39;t just throw people at it and say it will get done faster.

<p>Wonder if related... The union who awarded Campos is directly tied to the DHS. They come in and join Mandalay at the end of 2016. Seems like lots of things started coalescing with the government and Mandalay in the same time spans if both OP&#39;s are onto something. </p>
