        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I kicked it with a girl last night and I realized that I have nothing in common with people my age.</p>

<p>I’m 23 by the way.</p>

<p>Like she was cute for sure and I kept swellin’ up, but other than that it was difficult for me to relax and just enjoy myself.</p>

<p>This is no fault of hers either, because honestly I admire her delusional state of mind and miss when I was like that. It’s an innocence of sorts and I lost mine a while ago.</p>

<p>But for example, when she’s talking about some celebrity’s new hairstyle, I’m thinking about international Jewry.</p>

<p>When she brings up the new iOS update, my mind is focused on mass immigration and the destabilization of once great nations.</p>

<p>She talks about carving pumpkins this Halloween and all I can think about is the fact that our leaders are sexually deviant pedophiles and rapists who also occasionally participate in occult rituals.</p>

<p>The worst part is there’s really no way for me to steer the conversation towards any of these topics. They’re complex and take a good amount of research to fully grasp. At best she would think I’m joking and react with laughter, or she would think I’m insane and never talk to me again.</p>

<p>Should I try drugs? How do I get stupid and care free like normal people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question is: do you necessarily want a gf to discuss conspiracies with you? Is there more to YOU than conspiracies and being woke ?</p>

<p>Either find someone that matches you or learn that despite differences, it&#39;s what people are willing to do and tolerate from each other that shows how much someone is comited to anyone, in or out of the matrix.
You don&#39;t have to not be yourself, but you shouldn&#39;t judge, avoid, deny someone who doesn&#39;t see it the same way as you or doesn&#39;t even want to. 
She could even be your soft reset at home.... Lead to try new things... Even think differently than you currently do, and find that there&#39;s a proper time and place for everything, like reddit being your home for conspiracies and your bedroom home for blasting that D inside that V and/or A. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re not sure, at least try it. 
She may be the yin to your yang, the cheese to your ham or the patsy to your flag. 
Cheers*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing she&#39;s mentioned per your post that I can relate to is carving turnips for halloween. Because that&#39;s good, mindless fun. The rest would drive me batty. </p>

<p>If that&#39;s the sort of company you want to keep - it will continue to be a struggle unless you dissociate from your current reality and become a mindless one. </p>

<p>If it isn&#39;t, you&#39;ll need to adjust to being lonely until you meet people of higher thinking capacity. Not sure how easy that will be with 23 yr olds because most are in a know it all stage and if they&#39;re thinkers too... oh boy. </p>

<p>My brother is one but he is fucking insufferable. He turns every conversation into a bull in a china shop, where his mouth is the bull and your thoughts on any subject is the china shop. He won&#39;t let anyone speak so there&#39;s no room for exchange of thoughts, only for his to saturate the air around you. It&#39;s great occasionally, but long term it&#39;s maddening and all you want to do is avoid him.</p>

The only advice I can offer is taken from, in my opinion, one of the most brilliant minds to ever walk the planet Terence McKenna. I live by these quotes &quot;Culture is not your friend&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t be afraid to go it alone&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you want to? People aren&#39;t care-free. People are quietly miserable and don&#39;t know why or what to do about it, so they develop all kinds of bad habits to cope. They don&#39;t have agency over themselves and because they don&#39;t know why(or care to know why) they will never be able to work towards real satisfaction. </p>

<p>I recommend shrooms, lsd and marijuana but not all at the same time. </p>

<p>You kind of sound like a troll. If you&#39;re serious about the rabbit hole, keep digging and find other rabbits instead of messing with bimbos. If you&#39;re that bored with someone and just want to fuck get a hooker, it&#39;s about the same $ all told but way more efficient with your time. </p>

<p>Mindfulness practices have helped me share space with others better. When you listen to someone trying to understand their perspective instead of just waiting for them to finish talking so you can stick your dick in their mouth, you can sometimes get them to red pill themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just have compassion. This is why people don&#39;t listen to Conspiracy theorists, they think we&#39;re all self absorbed assholes who think we are better than everyone else because we are in the &quot;know&quot;. And truth be told, we can be. No one wants their perfect life destroyed, and none of us asked for this mess. </p>

<p>So IMO the best way to relate to people, is drop the conspiracy angle and just connect to them. Who cares if they like a celebrities hair cut, or the new IPhone. Talk about music, or art, or films, or books. There are a million billion other things to connect with than the trash heap we call the world. </p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, but I&#39;m sick of hearing conspiracy nuts complain about the &quot;unawakened&quot;. Its not their fault, America inparticular breeds ignorance. Some people just haven&#39;t met the right person/information to see what&#39;s truly going on. </p>
