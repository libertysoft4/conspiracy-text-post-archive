        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>apprently now residents from a few listed states will need to show proof of residency or U.S citizenship to fly from state to state.
I have no idea how Dreamers are suppose to show this. Our work permit is just that, a work permit. We dont have residency or U.S citizenship. Its like we were forgotten when this was approved.</p>

<p>Things just keep getting worst and worst.We keep beimg divided..... I wont be able to travel to see my family now?</p>

<p>Edit: its clear that a lot of people have been brainwashed with the mentality of &quot;you dont derve this because its not your born right&quot; or &quot;why are you taking our resources when we dont have enough?&quot; I am not your enemy. I was brought here when I was a child and see how things are changing im America. When I fight, i dont fight for myself. I fight because I believe everyone has the right to the persuit of happiness.
This is a clear sign of how division works.</p>

<p>No, I am basically saying OP should quit bitching that it&#39;s too cumbersome for him to continue living in a country illegally. This is like some shoplifter whining that a store&#39;s recent remodel makes it more difficult for him to steal Snickers bars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So do you just not understand how DACA works or are you just an asshole? They’re people who were brought here, not by choice but as young children. They undergo background checks every time they reapply. The literal only difference between them and me is instead of moving from OH to MD when they were 2 years old they moved from another country. If their parents had them two years later when they were here, they’d be citizens anyways. </p>

<p>No way! You mean people born in the US are US citizens? You&#39;re kidding, right? I guess I missed that day of law school. Does this mean that Scary Spice would be a US citizen if only she&#39;d been born in the US? </p>

<p>Why not just let the whole world be US citizens? After all, if only they&#39;d been born here, they&#39;d be citizens anyway. That&#39;s your argument. Bravo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah. I didnt expect this from this sub tbh. I thought people were more awake the the division agenda that has been planted in our brains. The agenda of feeling like theres not enough resourses so we must be selfish with them. When people like me really are not the root of this scarcity. Im sad, im not sure what I will do I cant find anything that talks about those who dont have a citizenship or residency. Im surpriced this wasnt being talked about thats why I posted it.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s not the most ideal solution especially if your in college right now, but have you looked into serving in the military? When I was in the Air Force there was a guy serving with just his green card and if you didn&#39;t know already, the military is a lot more then just ground pounders and infantry, most bases are basically micro cities, if you looked hard enough you could probably find a job in the military similar to what you wanted to do after school...(I&#39;ll save you some time also.....if you do go, trust me go Air Force)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you actually come to the border states and look for yourself?  Because then your worldview would be broken.  Quit trying to push the agenda that the &quot;undocumented immigrant&quot; comes here to seek a true and better life and does not use false identities (hint other people&#39;s stolen security numbers).</p>

<p>They have fraudulent documents such as counterfeit Social Security cards, forged drivers licenses, fake “green cards,” and phony birth certificates. Experts suggest that approximately 75 percent of working-age illegal aliens use fraudulent Social Security cards to obtain employment.</p>

<p>Here in Arizona, 33 percent or all identity theft is job-related to illegals using other&#39;s identities to seek welfare, food stamps and monthly tax funded stipends.</p>

<p>So yes, I have facts.  Not going to waste my time if you can&#39;t do research about illegals by actually living with and dealing with the illegals on a daily basis.  Go back to your mommy&#39;s basement and live in your dream world while the rest us of have our eyes open to the disgust that is happening (and has been happening for decades)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep and looking at your history of calling out &quot;the race card&quot; it so fits your profile and intended statement.</p>

<p>BTW the truth of the matter is that a majority of illegals (white, hispanic, asian, indian) fraud the US taxpayer.  Really quite simple if you pull your head out of the liberal media</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you must have came into the crountry legally to apply for residency. I came here when I was a child so I didnt have a choice and entered illegally. Advanced parole was only being approved for those who had a family member sick or dying or those exciting the country for work. Even when people applied for advanced parole (the only way to return legally) there was cases of Dreamers being held and denied entry. Officers would plant fake evidence and say that these dreamers were linked to gangs when that was not the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah its kind of confusing. if you are here under DACA (which is what im under) you arent technically allowed to leave the country or else you have self deported. if you want to leave the country you must ask for advanced parole (only approved under certaim circumstanses)
you ask for permission to leave and pay. but at the end of the day the officer can deny your entry if they feel like it.</p>
