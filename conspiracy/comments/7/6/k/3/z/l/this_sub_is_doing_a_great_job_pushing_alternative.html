<p>His theory was that perhaps the influx of new threads so shortly after Vegas, with no real activity prior to it, could be a way of distracting us from this Vegas mess that no one can get straight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adelson was Trump&#39;s biggest supporter, and is known to have a very adversarial relationship with the Chinese, who have supported the Clintons for decades. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t done enough research, but my suspicion based on their cooperation on other projects is that Steve Wynn, MGM, and the other casino players are Trump supporters that want to take down the Clinton/Rockefeller/China/CFR/CIA group.</p>

<p>Assuming that&#39;s correct, this Las Vegas attack appears to be aimed to cause financial harm to some of Trump&#39;s biggest donors, by harming Las Vegas tourism. Gun running also seems to be an important piece.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With all due respect, there are much simpler ways to impact finances to a much higher degree than to stage a mass shooting or to impact gambling/tourism. If the engame was gambling tourism, hit the machine manufacturers, cause an IT glitch that makes it appear that gambling machines are rigged to benefit the house, cast shade on the regulatory body overseeing the industry....mass shooting barely put a dent in LV tourism, so if that was the goal its was a poor plan.</p>

<p>I also struggle with gun running theories - they ignore too many other pieces of the scenario to make sense. Paddock&#39;s ownership represents a well heeled enthusiast at best. If he was trying to move weapons, he went about it in a very amateurish fashion, and given the guys&#39; level of planning an ability to comprehend, that seems outside his MO.</p>

<p>Then again - he does appear to be pretty well bent, which makes it hard for anyone to figure out every single piece of this.</p>

<p>Good ideas, would just like to see them more detailed out before I will put any of my research efforts towards them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not exactly about the shooting. It&#39;s about carving off a portion of the American people by sowing distrust.

Someone who they may be able to make use of later on. </p>

<p>Perhaps they are sowing the seeds of Revolution. After all, I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people who blame America for the downfall of the Soviet Union who would like to have revenge. </p>

<p>Every single mass casually event is turned into a conspiracy theory. Either the Government slaughters people essentially at random for little or no reason or there is another explanation. </p>

<p>If the conspiracy theorists would conclude just once that hey that dude was nuts and it&#39;s really screwed up that he killed all those people I might be less suspicious. There are all too many crazy, angry people in the world. Occasionally, they&#39;re going to do something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Conspiracy theorists&#39; aren&#39;t one homogenous lump of people with a hive mind, you know. You can have one person who thinks 9/11 was an inside job but that Paddock was just a lone wolf nut who snapped. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Russia does have disinfo agents, as do many countries, working on social media etc. But you have really bought into a load of bullshit if you believe that Russia is responsible for US citizens distrusting the US government. You really think the US government is trustworthy?</p>

<p>Have you actually gone and had a look at the confirmed conspiracies (in the side bar)? Things that have been confirmed and have been outed in the mainstream, involving huge vile conspiracies within the US government and govt agencies. The US government has been proven time and again to do terrible things, to lie about it and cover it up. So it makes sense to theorize about these events and to include govt conspiracy as a possibility. </p>

<p>You say it&#39;s statistically impossible for every event to be a conspiracy, but that isn&#39;t true at all! Of course it&#39;s possible for every event to be a conspiracy. Not likely, perhaps, it depends what type of events you mean. But it&#39;s completely possible. 
Your beliefs about what&#39;s possible have been completed manipulated by the media you&#39;ve been exposed to. You&#39;re a reasonably intelligent person who thinks they think about things in a logical and critical way, but you&#39;re only thinking within a very very small context/framework that has been provided for you by people you&#39;ve never met. Try to think deeply about how you know what you know about the world, and then question whether you can really say that you KNOW it, ask yourself what it means to KNOW. Think about what evidence means, and where you get your evidence from - is it direct, or is it fed to you pre packaged by someone else?</p>

<p>Is it possible people could feed you false information, tkae advatnage of the trust you and others put in them, to present you with an entirely false version of reality? And if your instinctual reaction to that question is &#39;no&#39; then think again about why it wouldn&#39;t be possible, what is stopping that manipulation of what you think you know about the world? IS there really anyone or anything stopping that from happening? If you believe there is, then how do you know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t accept any conspiracy as being confirmed. Seems to me that if they can claim victory in something that they should be able to take a firm stand on at least one conspiracy theory that has been disproven. This sub cannot even take a stand on Flat Earth. If they can&#39;t establish an obvious negative I don&#39;t think that they are capable of establishing an absolute positive.</p>

<p>Yes, there is a propaganda machine working in America just like they have in Russia and North Korea. Any Government will spin things for its own benefit. Population control is mostly done through education and indoctrination. I get that...</p>

<p>Only thing is the World is shrinking. The Internet is blurring the lines of Nations. I can have a conversation with someone who I&#39;ve never met who might live half a World away. The old style propaganda machines don&#39;t work as well as they once did. The World is changing and the people of the World are interacting amongst themselves in ways that were impossible only a few years ago.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve given the idea of Russian provocateurs a lot of thought. It just makes too much sense. They can achieve objectives that a million man standing army cannot. Promoting the things that are good for Russia is a very effective and cost-effective way to make the World a better place for Russia.</p>

<p>We all know that the CIA has done plenty of things to promote what&#39;s good for America throughout the World. They&#39;ve assassinated leaders, rigged elections, and sold drugs to the American people to fund their operations. I&#39;m not surprised at all that the Russians finally managed to get the upper hand over a situation and give them some of their own medicine in return.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they promote some &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; particularly the insane ones, because they make the public ignore the legitimate research being done and lump it all together as &#39;crazy&#39; right off the bat without even assessing the evidence. That is extremely useful to the Deep State and has worked very well for them. It&#39;s why the CIA came up with the term &#39;conspiracy theory,&#39; it&#39;s a psychological trick to make people forget that what matters is evidence and facts, and that it&#39;s foolish to dismiss claims on the basis of how absurd they sound to you rather than on the basis of facts and evidence. Instead the people who are actually making judgements and assessments on the basis of evidence are called crazy, while those who laugh and ignore evidence of incredibly worrying corruption and criminal activity solely on the basis of prejudice and presumption are regarded as &#39;sane&#39; and &#39;the norm.&#39; </p>

Maybe they made it clear that they weren&#39;t playing around and that they would put some serious hurt on him and his family unless he did what they told him to do. He&#39;s a perfect example of what that process of mixing bullshit with reality can do.</p>

<p>He broke into the scene with UFOs at Area 51 and went out with navigable natural caves big enough for submarines that went hundreds of miles inland. Talk about a progression...</p>

<p>Only thing is promoting some conspiracy theories can be helpful. I stand by the idea that promoting conspiracy theories about the Government committing mass shootings isn&#39;t a good idea. Such things make people really angry. Pretty soon those people could act on their anger. I just don&#39;t think that they would take such a risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the guy who killed himself and his daughter last week? There was talk about how the FBI had visited him the day before. That story was quickly amplified into him having some connection with Paddock. As far as I know there isn&#39;t any evidence that that is true.</p>

<p>I saw a heavily biased and completely unprofessional web page that sprung up like the next day that detailed the murder suicide and sprinkled the story with tons of other details written as if they were facts. The author took the angle that Paddock was a CIA gun runner. That&#39;s just a theory. There aren&#39;t any solid facts that point in that direction. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. </p>

<p>Personally, I think there is more to all of this than just a bunch of like minded conspiracy geeks tossing around ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea people are speculating and theorizing and of course sometimes that is dumb and/or inaccurate. But at least here you will find out about the inconsistencies, the lies, the evidence that&#39;s not being mentioned elsewhere. You get ALL the info, and then make of it what you will, using your own brain to evaluate evidence, instead of just nodding along to whatever&#39;s been neatly packaged for you by the MSM. </p>

<p>Of course when you give people free reign to speculate, to put forward any theory, to divulge and discuss every last detail and possibility, you are gonna get a lot of crap, but you are WAY more likely to actually find the truth in there, than you are in a restricted space where certain thoughts and ideas are dismissed a priori, where certain possibilities are assumed to be impossibilities before the evidence has even been assessed. That&#39;s the difference between r/conspiracy and subs like r/news.</p>

<p>Do I know anyone personally who was shot in LV, or know anyone who knew anyone who was shot there?  No.  I can only rely on others accounts through various media, such as TV and the Internet.  Something sure looks fishy about how the MSM and r/conspiracy have lined up their stories to bolster belief in a completely fictitious event.</p>

<p>Bottom line: the mass shooting in Las Vegas never occurred.  r/conspiracy is just as tainted as anyone in supporting lies and falsehoods, inaccuracies and red herrings, because any support to the idea that a real shooting actually happened in Las Vegas PROVES the teller is a liar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah. Now I have <em>permission</em>.</p>

<p>Has anyone noticed that Las Vegas is the major city nearest to Roswell, NM? </p>

<p>Forty years ago, a candy-assed singing duo known as &quot;Donny and Marie&quot; performed a number called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMZCWGyk388">&quot;A little bit country, a little bit rock and roll&quot;.</a>.  What do we see in Las Vegas 40 years later?  A crowd formed to hear &quot;country&quot; music and supposedly a guy &quot;rock and roll&quot;ed* on them.  Donny and Marie supposedly hailed from Utah, also suspiciously close to Roswell.  Neither Donny nor Marie has perceptibly aged in the last 40 years either, totally alien give-away.
*Arms enthusiasts call fully automatic gunfire &quot;rock and roll&quot;.</p>

<p>This PROVES that Donny and Marie were actually illuminati aliens from the Roswell colony who were buddies of shadow-president Hillary who then went on to hire Stephen Spielberg to create video for an entirely fictitious event known as &quot;the 2017 Las Vegas shooting&quot; all to try and help their commie buddy Kim Jon Un by distracting the public away from the &quot;High Noon&quot; showdown (God-Emperor Trump is Gary Cooper, natch) over Korea.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to add more dead people to the Clinton Death Count.   But LV doesn&#39;t help because the e&quot;vent&quot; was an in&quot;vent&quot;ion.  It&#39;s all so obvious if you just open your eyes!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they promote some &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; particularly the insane ones, because they make the public ignore the legitimate research being done and lump it all together as &#39;crazy&#39; right off the bat without even assessing the evidence. That is extremely useful to the Deep State and has worked very well for them. It&#39;s why the CIA came up with the term &#39;conspiracy theory,&#39; it&#39;s a psychological trick to make people forget that what matters is evidence and facts, and that it&#39;s foolish to dismiss claims on the basis of how absurd they sound to you rather than on the basis of facts and evidence. Instead the people who are actually making judgements and assessments on the basis of evidence are called crazy, while those who laugh and ignore evidence of incredibly worrying corruption and criminal activity solely on the basis of prejudice and presumption are regarded as &#39;sane&#39; and &#39;the norm.&#39; </p>
