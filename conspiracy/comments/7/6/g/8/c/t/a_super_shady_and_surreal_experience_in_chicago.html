        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This just happened nearly 25 minutes ago so I apologize in advance for the poor grammar.    </p>

<p>I&#39;m walking my dogs in downtown chicago in between the rain storms we are having.  As i cross michigan ave and walk onto the park side, there is a group of 25-35 men gathered around a dude and all I hear is him say they will all get paid next Tuesday for this.  The amount of backpack&#39;s and gear they had on them looked like they were going on a two week expedition into a jungle.  </p>

<p>Just this has all the cars driving past and anyone actually outside&#39;s attention.  Non of this makes sense, the gear, these guys, the rain.  </p>

<p>I do my normal circle in the park and As I head back i have to walk past them again.  They notice me this time and get quieter as I approach.  I&#39;m freaked out, my two dogs are freaked out but I keep walking as my dogs are both pretty big.  The light takes forever to change so I&#39;m stuck about 20-30 feet away from where they are standing in the park (i&#39;m on the crosswalk).  It&#39;s awkward, not for just me, but for them.  I staring at them and they all quickly look at me and then away.  Non of them wanted to make eye-contact, they were avoiding it.  Furthermore there is a black sedan parked on the side of the road, fully tinted windows regular Illinois plates (license started w/&#39;Z&#39;) - the group of men are all in their mid 20&#39;s-early 40&#39;s and then they begin chanting in arabic.  I am of arab decent but dont speak it, but from the tone and the fact I could hear them as I got a block away, it was clear that whatever they were saying wasn&#39;t anything good.</p>

<p>I was compelled to call the police.  I got about a block away from them and called from my smartwatch (left the cell at the house in cased it poured again).  When the operator answered I began to explain the situation.  &#39;Wilson&#39; only asked me if they were latino, and I said it looked to be a mix of all races, but I would say predominately arab.  I asked her to send someone immediately, and she didn&#39;t ask for any of my information, no identifying questions about these guys and said i&#39;ll have someone check it out.  </p>

<p>It didn&#39;t make sense that they didn&#39;t ask me for any of the information so I called back a second time and got a different operator.  When I told her I was calling back because i thought it was strange that the last operator didn&#39;t ask me anything and she even agreed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what this means, but I do want to make sure that my report was actually filed and if something does actually happen in the city of chicago in the next couple of days, then please remember this.  we need to pull the cameras (chicago has the most in any city of than scotland yard) and pull the facial images of the group of men standing in the rain at the corner of michigan ave and 9th street on park side of the street from at least 740pm - 755pm.  </p>

<p>EDIT:<br/>
1. I am 1st generation american of arab decent - i am not a racist and me calling the cops has nothing to do with their race or religion.<br/>
2. yes, smartwatch&#39;s have sim cards and are phones themselves - i bought the smartwatch with a bluetooth headset so i didn&#39;t have to take my phone everywhere i go.  especially during late night dog walks in the rain.  </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/9FoP5">Pics of the location</a> This is a series of images of the spot they had.  i know a lot of people are saying it&#39;s so conspicuous, but in actuality at night, it&#39;s hard to see into the park.  further more, if these guys were up to something nefarious, there are a slew of hotels all across the street which would make this an ideal meeting spot.
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/1f8O6">Pics of my smartwatch/cellphone calls to 911</a> I have ATT numbersync so my watch masks it&#39;s number with my cell phone number.  for some reason my cell phone does not log the watch&#39;s log, it goes the other way around.</p>

<p>Can you imagine what it would be like if you saw a crime or accident in the street and you had <em>drive home</em> to call in about? or search for a pay phone? Hard to believe that was the case like two decades ago. I was born in (90’s) so I’ve had a cell phone since 6th grade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/1f8O6">yes it does.</a></p>

<p>so in the images, the smart watch shows i called at 7:52 - and if you look above it, you see the log of my phone call at 8pm.  </p>

<p>i have ATT number sync, so the watch has it&#39;s own log and downloads the phone&#39;s log.  The phone does not download calls for some reason i make from my watch.  Which is the reason the watch shows two emercency calls vs the phone having only the one call.</p>

<p>Nope, I&#39;m a fucking Marine you piece of shit. I work Intel and can&#39;t post pics you fucking twat sandwhich. But you know, because I can&#39;t incriminate myself in anyway in terms of identity, it must mean there&#39;s now way I&#39;m a marine. Guess what? IDGAF about needing to prove anything to anyone, plus this stupid bitch who posted her uniform is fucking commie sellout and should be stripped of her status and uniform anyway. Good chance I was her sergeant as well. She didn&#39;t even fucking realize superiors wear cufflinks dumbbroad.</p>

<p>So some neck beard takes this to quityiurbullshit and subreddit drama lol. These are fucking Reddit usernames, in my case vpn/proxy/tor throwaways, idgaf about my username. Im trained at work to leave it and start newones you fucking twat. You&#39;re lucky I&#39;m drunk right now, I can make one phonecall right now and post all your info if I wanted to</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s SO obvious. Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#39;t. Nothing about it seems outlandish at all. I do agree though that maybe you should unsubscribe. Maybe start a new sub, where the only posts allowed are ones that have thorough video/photographic/forensic evidence to back up everything posted, and ban anyone who wants to discuss or conjecture about any of it without their own proof. No game-theory allowed, no theorizing in any form, not anecdotal incidents or reports from the field, only hard-proof. That way you&#39;re happy &amp; we&#39;re happy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve subbed here for almost 8 years &amp; the biggest problem I&#39;ve seen over recent years are all the assholes who immediately launch into name-calling/insults/ and basically use all the  tactics explicitly laid out in <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/07/22/1112509/-The-Gentleperson-s-Guide-to-Forum-Spies">A Gentlemen&#39;s Guide to Forum Spies</a>, so thoughtfully placed in our sidebar as a reminder to <em>always be vigilant</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>farther down than I am on Michigan but that park by Oak street often has large groups of honestly just shady people who appear to be organizing. It could be gang related, drug related, honestly anything in this city. This past week though I have absolutely noticed some things on the street at night that do not seem normal.

    <div class="md"><p>You really think the NSA is going to keep up with every single unfounded accusation? The fact of the matter is that these guys weren&#39;t doing anything wrong. A gathered group doesn&#39;t make a terror plot. It all hinges on they were &quot;arab&quot; and supposedly chanting. In the pouring rain...or was it a break in the showers? You would have to ask op since his story keeps changing to suit the questions he is asked.</p>

<p>While there are definitely people who <em>immediately</em> believe personal anecdotes/stories, there are a lot more, including myself, who simply put this sort of information on the Maybe Shelf in our brains.</p>

<p>With things like 4chan posts, or stories like this post, I don&#39;t automatically <em>believe</em> it, but neither do I want to completely disregard the information because it may be true or important someday.</p>

<p>There are also many people here who simply entertain the idea that this story is true and ask questions without actually believing it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>There are a lot of conspiracy related stories and conspiracy theories in general that just don&#39;t have a lot of evidence backing it up. Some people ignore posts like that, but I find it much more fun and entertaining to speculate with the community here, even though it&#39;s something I don&#39;t necessarily believe is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Muslims don&#39;t hate dogs, except the ones with bad experiences or phobias or whatever. I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s probably more likely to do with the stringent cultural guidelines for social interactions, there&#39;s a lot of stuff they have to re-learn about Western culture, for instance not bringing presents the first time you meet someone, etc. These are not necessarily rules or cultural paradigms that have to do Islam or being Muslim much of the time, but moreso where they grew up or regional cultural phenomenon. Nowhere in those rules is &quot;doing business with someone while their dog is there&quot; (and perhaps being aggressive or barking, not in this case since if your dog was misbehaved you&#39;d probably not keep it at work- then again, I was born\grew up here and there&#39;s still plenty of strange cultural shit I&#39;m learning, I wish I had a nickel for every time I had to ask who some celebrity was, especially within the country music ouvre) and it&#39;s not likely they&#39;ll learn about such things, even given an ivy-league degree. So be patient, they have nothing against your dog, they&#39;re just confused, and anyone with familiarity outside the West can attest: having a dog around while you conduct business or in a business environment is so rare as to virtually never happen. Besides, my aunt has three chihuahuas and a mix, and I have a chihuahua myself, at no time has my family displayed any sort of cultural bias towards them, n or has any been evident the times we&#39;ve discussed the dogs. Frankly, I&#39;m a bit surprised that a businessperson would be willing to make such a negative first impression as to say &quot;no&quot; when asked for such a small concession, because I can easily imagine that &#39;no&#39; is followed by &quot;because fuck you (for being brown, Muslim, different, etc)&quot; in the customer&#39;s heads. Such is the climate of the micro and macro interactions the West and especially America has fostered towards Muslims since 9\11. If it hasn&#39;t hurt your business though, do you- I use a service dog, so I&#39;m empathetic. </p>

<p>TL;DR: people have different cultures, try to understand before writing off an entire cultural group for no crime larger than having a different culture. Also Muslims don&#39;t hate dogs. </p>

I understand that their &#39;soldiers&#39; in their ME strongholds are paid as per any other standing army, but recruits on foreign soil? It&#39;s not something I have heard of before. Maybe in a way it is good news. Is their ideology losing its grip? It is far easier to defeat a normal army that ideological fanatics.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You congratulate an American citizen falling for the constant fear propaganda and ratting on his fellow citizens to the state for assembling as a group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely <em>horrible</em> assumptions on your part.  Your assuming that this is what they in fact were is an indication of a mind that doesn&#39;t actually think too well or too logically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have the right to free association and assembly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely we do.  Any intelligent individual in this day and age, however, with all the corporate government mass shootings and false flags going on, would do well to report any weird or suspicious activity, for it might actually NOT be any type of citizens assembling a revolt.  It might be the CIA or FBI or other three letter agency assembling another false flag.</p>

<p>Which is which?</p>

<p>On one hand, you don’t necessarily want to foil an attempt at a possible citizen uprising - true - but you also don’t want to knowingly allow a possible false flag attack go by unreported.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is cowardly and un American.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What’s cowardly and unAmerican is not fighting against the state terrorism that’s been going on for a long, long time.</p>

<p>You’re, again, simply not thinking logically.  At all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if like many on this sub, you believe that we&#39;ve seen an erosion of those freedoms post 9/11, you&#39;re doing exactly what they want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite incorrect on your part.  You’re logic is simply going too far overboard on one side of the dynamic while not taking into proper consideration the other.  This is not intelligent or critical thinking on your part.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every distopian fiction as well as every real life dictatorship relies on people tattling on their neighbors out of fear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your contentions are understood, and they’re not without validity.  However, if a group <em>really</em> wants to assemble an uprising (which, incidentally, I’m actually all for doing), then it would be much wiser to do it behind closed doors so something like what happened in the OP doesn’t occur.</p>

<p>If you really stop and think about it, a citizen uprising that’s not intelligent enough and doesn’t have its shit together enough to know NOT to assemble like this group did at night in the middle of the street might end up doing more harm than good and might not be worth supporting anyway - even if it <em>was</em> some sort of possible citizen uprising.</p>

<p>As such, and again, while your thoughts might not be coming from a horrible place, the manner in which you attempt to apply these thoughts is entirely misguided - especially in today’s day and age of false flags and hoaxes perpetrated by the state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very well thought out response but I couldn&#39;t disagree more. You can assert that my view on this post is too simplistic but in my mind it is a very simple situation. You believe in freedom and liberty, or you don&#39;t. My personal politics put me in the camp of only turning to the authoritarian arm of the state in the most dire of situations. And those do exist. People who sound like the bad guys on tv forming a group in public, isn&#39;t one of them. It is cowardly. I stand by that. I&#39;m not even going the whole racist/xenophobic route on this because that&#39;s so obvious it doesn&#39;t even need to be stated. The core issues are living in unjustified fear and subservience to authority. And the only reason I bother to comment is because this should be a sub full of people who know better. I would expect this from the larger public.</p>

<p>Life is nowhere near that simple or simple-minded.  <em>You</em> don’t believe in freedom.  You think you do, but that’s because you haven’t gone through what and how you actually think quite as thoroughly as you should.</p>

<p>You don’t have freedom to do whatever you want - nor <em>should</em> you, for that matter.  Things can get very complicated, and not acknowledging that (i.e. that you don’t have freedom to do whatever you want) is a disservice to moving forward as an intelligent being.</p>

<p>I’m really hoping that I don’t need to detail how exactly we’re most definitely <em>not</em> free in this country or planet - but just as a tiny example, all one need to do is think bout the many restrictions put upon our everyday life preventing us from doing a slue of things that would otherwise be the case if we <em>didn’t</em> have those restrictions in place and we were in fact free.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My personal politics put me in the camp of only turning to the authoritarian arm of the state in the most dire of situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My personal <del>politics</del> perspectives put me in the camp of vying toward a more anarchic system of governance - one whose authority is the individual’s own intelligence and responsibility and not state-dependent or derived.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And those do exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure they do, actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People who sound like the bad guys on tv forming a group in public, isn&#39;t one of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing I said above is against this.  Don’t know what you’re meaning by this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not even going the whole racist/xenophobic route on this because that&#39;s so obvious it doesn&#39;t even need to be stated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would racism or xenophobia have to even be part of this discussion?  That’s wholly unnecessary.  <a href="/u/Gaddafi_Was_Right">/u/Gaddafi_Was_Right</a>&#39;s  comments seemed to have nothing to do with even <em>implying</em> anything like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The core issues are living in unjustified fear and subservience to authority.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.  The core issues involve being responsible enough to acknowledge when something against the betterment of society as a whole <em>might</em> be going on - and being responsible enough to call it out.  THAT’S the core issue here.</p>

<p>And this has nothing in and of itself to do with any type of state authority whatsoever.  Even in an anarchic society where there is no centralized, state authority figure, OP’s actions would still be justified.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this should be a sub full of people who know better. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Full of people who know better than to what? than bring to light possible state chicanery?  You’re only thinking about this in one specific way, and that is most certainly not the only way this scenario can be seen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would expect this from the larger public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason you would expect that is because you’re, again, simply not thinking about this dynamic correctly.  You’re only looking at it from one very limited perspective, and that is in fact quite myopic and distorted, ultimately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are minimizing and marginalizing the very kind of citizen reporting that has been responsible for uncovering a lot of actual PTB chicanery in false flag scenarios before; the kind of citizen investigating that has gotten to the bottom of situations like Sandy Hook, the Boston Bombing, and that has uncovered a great deal of inconsistent state narratives revolving around this most recent Las Vegas shooting.</p>

<p>This is an example of a childish mentality on your part attempting to marginalize the very type of action that can help get to the bottom of possible nefarious activity (on a civilian level or on a greater state level) that could be taking place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure you have heard the story of the boy who called wolf? Well, in major cities if you make enough unfounded reports they no longer show up when you call. This guy had no real reason to make that call. It was around 8pm...not the middle of the night. They weren&#39;t doing anything wrong. Just because you call 911 doesn&#39;t mean they have to show up if you have a history of making unfounded claims. Not to mentions ops story doesn&#39;t add up or hold weight. U can go ahead and be one of those people who call 911 when you see a brown skin person with a backpack...as for me? I don&#39;t jump to conclusions and like to have a little more basis before I have the police intrude on a person who is doing nothing wrong. Living in the inner city teaches you a few things. If someone is planning something...they will be at that location more than once and at different times to get a true scope. Doubt they are going to stand there in a large group talking loud about payday and chanting cries of terrorism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>completely unrelated, but you reminded me of my story.  </p>

<p>I was in Chicago not to long ago.  I was on a cross country road trip to the east coast, and had stopped in chicago for the night on a sunday.  I had my two dogs with me as well (the whole reason for driving instead of flying).<br/>
  Early in the evening i went out for dinner, and had a great time.  Came back to the hotel thinking what a cool city, and that I would have to come back some time.<br/>
  Around two am, my dog Kaia decides she has to pee.  Now.  She is whining at the door.  So I leash both of them up, and head out into the urban jungle.  Our hotel was right down near the lake, and we set out on our walk.  Kaia was pissed there was no grass.  anywhere.  So she wouldn&#39;t pee.  We kept walking and walking, and then turned a corner.
  I will NEVER forget what we saw.  Two blocks away walking right towards us on the same street was a fucking gang!  The took up the complete street left to right, sidewalk to sidewalk.  There must have been a hundred up them, and they were walking right towards us.  They had weapons, bats that i could see, and god knows what else.  It was a wall of people walking towards us.<br/>
  I was about halfway up my block, but immediately turned around, praying that they had not seen us.  Who knows what they were doing, but I&#39;ve been all over the world, in all different kinds of bad situations (even been shot at), and this was hands down the scariest shit i&#39;ve ever seen.  I have never seen anything so threatening in my life.  Maybe I could have just kept walking towards them, and they would have let me through, but every instinct in my body told me to turn around, stay calm, and then run at the first chance i got.  I don&#39;t think ill be going back there anytime soon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guy sees a group of Arab men who have been coerced into an MLM scheme by a friend from their community center. &quot;You will get paid next Tuesday for this,&quot; the leader says. Guy eyes them suspiciously and walks past twice so they get quiet because he&#39;s being weird. They chant the MLM slogan at the leader&#39;s awkward insistence.</p>

<p>Guy goes home to post on reddit that he saw a terrorist attack being planned. That was being planned in the open on Michigan Ave in Chicago for some reason. Definitely had to be a terrorist plan, though, because they were speaking arabic!</p>

<p>Guy has no evidence of any of it.</p>

<p>Guy gets upvoted because arabs <em>must</em> be up to something, right??</p>

<p>It’s not just skin color. Please educate yourself. I’m not arguing about rather OP was right or wrong but your use of skin color. People that are racist don’t hate the person because of their skin color. They may label them or identify them based on skin color but the racism is based on traits attributed to a certain group based on their race. So someone saying they don’t like a group of Arab men because the assumption is that they are Muslim or terrorist etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the first part i heard was in english.  they were speaking english when i heard the guy in the middle of their hub say they would each get paid tuesday.  </p>

<p>The only time i heard arabic was when they started chanting - i couldn&#39;t make out the words.  i think it was for a variety of reasons, first i my adrenaline was kicking into overdrive.  secondly, if you look at the pictures i posted of their location in my edit, i was already on the other side of michigan avenue about half way down 9th street (street that runs east west)</p>

<p>so as much as i would love to tell you something speccific, i can&#39;t.  but i do know whatever their entire group was chanting in was arabic and not hebrew, for sure not spanish and it wasn&#39;t english.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is hard to tell if this is something or not.  Time will tell.  Clearly many of the protest/activists/terrorists are paid, so the line about when people will be paid is believable.  The location for a clandestine meeting seems odd, but my guess is it was a spontaneous meeting.  If hotels are in the vicinity, a call may have gone out that so and so was available for a meeting. This is all speculation of course -- but that is what we have available to us as we try to anticipate the next blow up.  I am curious about the 911 call and the response.  Now if nothing has happened, the authorities may not be in a position to respond.  You cannot respond to every suspicious gathering.  Just file the story away.  Something may emerge or not.  Maybe they were a drug pushing ring.  Whatever it is, they are getting paid, so it would be good to know, but no way of knowing from just this one encounter.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, let me try and break this down. Bear with me, as this might get long. <strong>TL;DR at bottom</strong></p>

<p>You say it&#39;s very conspicuous, but then backtrack that in your edit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just this has all the cars driving past and anyone actually outside&#39;s attention.</p>

<p>i know a lot of people are saying it&#39;s so conspicuous, but in actuality at night, it&#39;s hard to see into the park.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>You</em> were one of those people saying it was so conspicuous in your story. Did the idea of potential terrorists convening in a public area not make sense, so you adjusted your story to fit more in line with it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They notice me this time and get quieter as I approach. I&#39;m freaked out, my two dogs are freaked out...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point in the story, what is there to be &quot;freaked out&quot; about? People not wanting a stranger to be listening in on their conversation, regardless of topic?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s awkward, not for just me, but for them. I staring at them and they all quickly look at me and then away. Non of them wanted to make eye-contact, they were avoiding it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this contributes to your story. Are you saying that you find it suspicious that someone would want to break eye contact with someone they don&#39;t know standing 20-30 feet away?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore there is a black sedan parked on the side of the road, fully tinted windows regular Illinois plates (license started w/&#39;Z&#39;)...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t bring this detail up again. Do you know if they were associated at all with that sedan or did it just happen to be parked there?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and then they begin chanting in arabic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What would you define as chanting? Because they could have just been talking amongst themselves in a language you don&#39;t understand. Or possibly practicing a religion that doesn&#39;t consist entirely of terrorists?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am of arab decent but dont speak it, but from the tone and the fact I could hear them as I got a block away, it was clear that whatever they were saying wasn&#39;t anything good. I was compelled to call the police.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, I think, is the crux of the story: You thought these Arab people looked suspicious, so you called 911. They aren&#39;t going to ask for full information and send someone over for <em>every</em> suspicious person call, especially if you couldn&#39;t provide any info on what they were doing that was so suspicious (or if you were in any clear danger), and <em>especially</em> in a big city like Chicago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I told her I was calling back because i thought it was strange that the last operator didn&#39;t ask me anything and she even agreed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly did the <em>second</em> operator say once you told her what your call was about? Was she just as dismissive or did she take it more seriously?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do want to make sure that my report was actually filed and if something does actually happen in the city of chicago in the next couple of days, then please remember this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem with that: If we kept track of every single time anyone reported a &quot;suspicious person/group&quot; in a major city, then the ratio of reports to actual occurrences would be insanely high. Only a tiny percentage of those reports could get followed up on,  and even then they might turn up empty. Keeping track of them to that amount would serve no purpose except to validate whoever made the report on the <em>extremely unlikely chance</em> that it leads to something.</p>

<p>As for the pics of the location, that just leads to further disbelief: It&#39;s literally off the sidewalk at a traffic intersection (presumably with cameras) across from some tall buildings in one of the biggest cities in the country. It&#39;s probably the worst spot to convene for a terrorist plan I&#39;ve ever seen. This would mean that these guys are both incredibly organized for convening like this and insanely stupid for risking getting caught so much.</p>

<h1><strong>TL;DR</strong></h1>

<p>As far as this goes, this is a nothing story trying to make itself sound more elaborate than it actually is. It boils down to &quot;Guy is suspicious of group of Arabs, calls the police&quot;. Everything mentioned is either something exaggerated or misinterpreted by the OP, with no details to provide suspicion other than &quot;I couldn&#39;t understand what they were saying, and they looked like they could be terrorists&quot;.</p>

<p>Anybody upvoting this is either just as prejudiced as the OP, paranoid, or wants to be able to say that they knew about a terrorist attack before it happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP, just to state the obvious: no, no one&#39;s pics should be pulled in order to identify the members of this supposed group and have the state armed forces harass them in any way. We in the US have the right to assemble, which is part of our god/universe given rights. </p>

<p>However, that being said. Should something happen, it would be great to pull the info you have referenced, and if our police/surveillance state are worth anything they will especially keep the videos referenced just in case anything happens. Didn&#39;t seem to work that way In Las Vegas though, did it? </p>

<p>Something tells me the propaganda on crime/terrorism is trying to push useful technology as something that can be used to prevent crime via thoughtcrime/assembly - as opposed to using these cameras when something actually happens. Interesting </p>

Good thing those but jobs don&#39;t have access to the cameras. Wtf. And people wonder the survivors and the guard don&#39;t want shit to do with the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too, had a compellingly surreal scene escalating episode in Chicago with a young man that took it upon himself to start polishing my shoes, then unsuccessfully demanded $8/shoe plus tip. While not as potentially detrimental as the aberrant activity observed by OP, hopefully the luxury of awareness to &quot;Seymour Shineboxes&quot; industrial complex might result in avoidance or at best a more diplomatically economic exchange.
Since having my proverbial and philosophical arse anchored in Alabama virtually since the nurse spanked it, when the proposal to take a road trip with my mom to conference in Chicago while catching two Moody Blues concerts along the way was entertained I graciously accepted. 
Booked at the Knickerbocker hotel I was delightfully overwhelmed at the number of attractions within walking distance, then realized the appeal of a comfy new pair of sneakers promised in the adventures that lay ahead. We stopped at Hibbets on the way and found some fantastic Under Armour trainers on the 50% clearance table, the were just a size too big, and cocaine white. Naturally the frugal voice in my head made best argument and thus man and shoe were joined as one in tenacious inevitability, as always.
My skins beginning to tingle just typing what an amazing energy Chicago has, a presence, a soul perhaps. There&#39;s something that reincarnates the innocence of curiosity that compels us to experience every proclivity the city has to offer, in a calm orderly manner of course. And so that first day I had no itinerary and just merged into a school of pedestrians navigating the concrete and asphalt oceans riding the current wherever it took me. It got to be about 10pm and despite the new shoes and habit of walking the course when play golf, the thermal dynamics of July were unusually arrogant, as was I with distance walked and found myself suddenly exhausted with aching bones and still a nice little clip back to hotel. A cab ride briefly entertained the imagination until my masochist unconscious overruled and I begin back to the Knickerbocker.  Shortly after a fella walking towards me acknowledges and compliments my shoes. I say thanks just as we&#39;re about to cross and then all of a sudden in one fluid motion he grabbed a hand towel wrapped around neck, said don&#39;t kick me while dropping to one knee proceeding to start buffing/shining my brand new sneakers. The only response my brain could process was the &quot;but why?&quot; look deer often have in that final twilight before the most brilliant of Technicolor explosions. Being in the business of unsolicited shoe shine&#39;s he was ready with the &quot;keep those new shoes looking new&quot; angle while highlighting he takes no government handouts, works for everything his family has and also raising his son with same values. He was well spoken and not physically imposing with a little height and weight on me, virtually a threat factor zero so I dropped guard a bit and chatted bout where I was from and was in town for business. He had finished up and as he&#39;s wrapping towel back around neck I thought I heard him say &quot;I charge $8/shoe plus tip&quot; and assumed he was talking about his station at airport or wherever the people who actually need their shoes shined come to get them done. Unfortunately my assumption proved itself when I tried to hand him $1.</p>

<p>&quot;What is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uhh... That&#39;s a dollar.&quot; Realizing what the entire 5 minute charade had been all about I again let my guard down and started to get angry at the situation and in turn the guy who was loading up &quot;Naa man I told you I charge $8/shoe plus a tip and you out here tryna give me a damn dollar.&quot;
I wanted so badly to articulately reproach his attempted extortion with any of the several valid reasons I had for not acquiescing but all I could come up with was &quot;You can either take this and get somewhere, or you can just fucking get somewhere cause I&#39;m finna dip PATNA.&quot; He thought for a second and thank goodness just said &quot;Gimmie that&quot; and grabbed the $1. I guess my body was sensing the de-escalation in real time and all the self preservation mechanisms my brain had been trying to process started processing how incredibly vulnerable and stupid I was getting in a pissing match by myself over $20 in Chicago. Looking back not one of my prouder moments and would handle the situation with a bit more sophistication instead of piss and vinegar.                </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since I first read your post, I&#39;ve been doing a little research. You said that they said next Wednesday. I find that little odd if they said next when most people would say this, so I wonder if they meant the 24th which would be the next Tuesday after this Tuesday. Sorry for the redundancy, I&#39;m just trying to make it clear what I mean. Anyway, it looks like <a href="http://www.unitedcenter.com/events/2017/10/24/katy-perry-witness/">Katy Perry</a> is having a concert that night in Chicago.

Notice in the post here he does not say he asked Wilson if she needed his info...in his other post in conspiracyundone he says that. Here is the post from that sub.</p>

<p>The following events happened in Chicago, IL, on the evening of Saturday, October 14, 2017, between 7:40 PM - 7:55 PM, at the intersection of S. Michigan Avenue and E. 9th Street, during a late-night dog walk. I am posting here in the hopes that someone ― anyone ― will take me seriously, so that something terrible might be prevented.</p>

<p>This post has been edited together in a coherent narrative, as based on my rushed original post on the Conspiracy subreddit, and incorporates answers to FAQ that those commenting on that original thread had.</p>

<p>I am posting my account anywhere where those with inquiring minds may find it, in the hopes that someone can help make heads or tails of what I saw. </p>

<p>────────</p>

<p>I was walking my dogs late at night in downtown Chicago, on the evening of Saturday, October 14, 2017, taking advantage of the gap between the rain storms we&#39;ve been having lately. The previous night, it had been pouring outside on and off all day long, and Saturday wasn&#39;t much better. On account of this, the only people that were out (other than myself) were fellow dog-walkers, and perhaps a handful of people making a break for the store a couple blocks away.</p>

<p>Along my walk, I crossed S. Michigan Avenue at E. 9th Street, and walked onto side closest to the Formal Gardens park, there was a group of 25-35 men, all of them in their mid 20&#39;s to early 40&#39;s, holding signs and garbed in a tremendous amount of equipment, gathered around another another man, obviously a commander of sorts. Here are some images of the spot where they were standing.</p>

<p>As I passed, I overheard the person in the leadership role say to them, in English, &quot;You&#39;ll all get paid next Tuesday for this.&quot;</p>

<p>Next Tuesday, as in October 17, 2017. </p>

<p>From the backpacks and large amount of gear the men had on, it appeared as if they were planning to go on a two-week expedition into a jungle. At first, for a brief moment, it occurred to me they may have been a Crossfit group or something of the sort ― the type of people who wear weighted packs and what-not to offer resistance while they exercise ― but upon further inspection, the men were wearing galoshes and boots which were not at all suitable for aerobic activity, so I ruled that out quickly.</p>

<p>The unusual sight had everyone&#39;s attention, not just mine. Everyone outside at the time, umbrellas and all, were noticeably perturbed and staring, as was everyone driving by. It wasn&#39;t the kind of kind you usually see on a rainy morning in Chicago, you know? In all my years of living in Chicago (and I&#39;ve lived here a very long time), I can say with certainty that I personally have never seen anything like it.</p>

<p>None of it ― the gear, the guys, the rain ― made any sense. I struggled to figure out a rational explanation for it. The equipment looked nothing like camera gear. There are three or more liberal arts universities in the surrounding area, so as a result I see a lot of the students filming projects in Formal Gardens park, and elsewhere. These people were not students, or filmmakers. Just looking at the scene made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, and I got a sort of sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.</p>

<p>I finished my normal circle around the park, and as I came around the loop, I had to walk past the group of men again. This time they noticed me, and got quieter as I approached. I started freaking out but did my best to keep my composure.</p>

<p>At that point, my two dogs started to freak out, too, which didn&#39;t help at all. I don&#39;t know if they picked up on my vibes or what, but both of them large, intimidating breeds (a Doberman Pinscher and a German Shepherd), and they are not easily frightened. With dogs like mine, which keep just about everyone at bay, I&#39;m pretty safe no matter where I go. Still, I was nervous.</p>

<p>In spite of all of this, I kept walking.</p>

<p>At the Michigan intersection, the light took forever to change, so I ended up stuck in the crosswalk, my dogs and I standing about 20-30 feet away from where the men in the park were positioned.</p>

<p>I could tell my presence was making it awkward for the group of men, whoever they were. I couldn&#39;t help but stare at them while I was waiting, and watched as they all shot glances in my direction, and then quickly looked away. It was clear they were trying to avoid making eye-contact with me.</p>

<p>I looked around to see if anything else out of the ordinary was going on, and took note of a black sedan with fully-tinted windows, parked on the side of the road. It had standard Illinois plates, and a license which started with the letter &quot;Z&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s when things got even more unsettling. At that moment, as I was still trapped in the crosswalk, the large group of men ― all 25-35 of them ― began chanting in Arabic. I am confident of this. It was definitely not English or Spanish, and it certainly wasn&#39;t Hebrew either (all of which I am familiar with).</p>

<p>A moment later, the light finally changed, and I started moving away from the group, back toward home. The chanting was audible even from a distance, and from the group&#39;s tone, it was clear that, whatever they were saying, it wasn&#39;t anything good. With that said, however, I couldn&#39;t make any of it out. By the time the chanting started, I was already on the other side of Michigan Avenue about half-way down 9th Street (the street that runs East to West), which made it difficult to discern anything, even if they had been chanting in English (which they weren&#39;t). Not to mention the fact that by that point my adrenaline was kicking into overdrive. As much as I would love to tell all of you something more specific, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Now, before I go any farther, I want to be clear: I am a first-generation American, and of Arab descent myself, but I don&#39;t speak a word of the language. I grew up in a household where English was the primary language, and Arabic, though it was spoken, was spoken infrequently. So I know a few words, but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>I say this as evidence that I am most certainly not a racist, and what I did next has nothing at all to do with the race or religion of group of men I saw. I also say this to make clear why I, as someone of Arab descent, aren&#39;t familiar with the language, and couldn&#39;t tell you what it is the men had said, even if I had been standing right beside them.</p>

<p>In any event, by the time I had heard the chanting, I was more than ready to call the police. </p>

<p>I had left my actual phone at home when I went on the walk, as it wasn&#39;t waterproof and I didn&#39;t want to get caught in a rain storm with it. So once I was about a block removed from the Michigan Ave intersection and the strange, chanting group, I made the call from my smartwatch using the Bluetooth headset I take with me everywhere I go.</p>

<p>Proof of the calls made.</p>

<p>A female operator by the name of &quot;Wilson&quot; answered, and I began to explain the situation as calmly as I could. </p>

<p>&quot;Were the men Latino?&quot; Wilson asked me.</p>

<p>&quot;They looked to me like a mix of all races,&quot; I said, &quot;but I would say predominately Arab.&quot;</p>

<p>I asked Wilson to send someone immediately.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll have someone check it out,&quot; she replied, without so much as a hint of emotion in her voice.</p>

<p>It felt like she was either not taking me seriously, or distracted by what she thought were more pressing matters. However, I thought it was strange she wasn&#39;t more interested, and didn&#39;t want to know who I was, or get any of my information, or any more details.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you need any of my information?&quot; I spoke up.</p>

<p>&quot;Not at this time,&quot; Wilson responded.</p>

<p>That was it. No personal info from me needed. No identifying questions about the men I saw. She didn&#39;t ask about their clothing, what the backpacks looked like... nothing.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t make sense that she didn&#39;t ask me for any of the information, so after she and I disconnected, I called back a second time and got a different operator.</p>

<p>I told the second operator that the reason I was calling bac was because I found it was strange that the last operator hadn&#39;t asked me any questions. To my surprise, she agreed with me that it was odd.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what any of what I saw means, but I do want to make sure that my report was actually filed, and if something does actually happen in the city of Chicago in the next couple of days, or on October 17, then please remember this.</p>

<p>We need to pull the cameras (Chicago has the most of any city, other than Scotland Yard), and pull the images of the group of men standing in the rain at the corner of S. Michigan Ave and E. 9th Street on the Formal Gardens side of the street from at least 7:40 PM - 7:55 PM Central time.</p>

<p>For those who missed the link earlier in this post, this is a gallery of a series of images of the spot where the group of men were located.</p>

<p>I realize that many people are going to say, &quot;This is so conspicuous!&quot; But in actuality, at night it&#39;s hard to see into the park, even more so when it&#39;s raining. Furthermore, if these men were up to something nefarious, there are a slew of hotels located directly across the street which would make for an ideal meeting spot. </p>

<p>And again, for those who missed the earlier embedded link, here is a gallery of pictures of my smartwatch/cellphone calls to 911 as well. In the images, the smartwatch shows I called at 7:52 PM Central time, and if you look above it, you&#39;ll see the log of my phone call at 8 PM. I have AT&amp;T &quot;number sync,&quot; so the watch has its own log and downloads the phone&#39;s log. For some reason, my phone, a Galaxy S3, does not download calls I make from my watch (which is the reason the watch shows two emergency calls VS. the phone having only the one call). Also, my watch masks its number with my cell phone number.</p>

<p>I pray nothing happens. I don&#39;t consider myself a p</p>

But you know, because I can&#39;t incriminate myself in anyway in terms of identity, it must mean there&#39;s now way I&#39;m a marine. Guess what? IDGAF about needing to prove anything to anyone, plus this stupid bitch who posted her uniform is fucking commie sellout and should be stripped of her status and uniform anyway. Good chance I was her sergeant as well. She didn&#39;t even fucking realize superiors wear cufflinks dumbbroad.</p>
