    <div class="md"><p>Where it gets fishy, and this is from Politifact, is: </p>

<p>&quot;Nine people related the company at some point in time donated to the Clinton Foundation, but we only found evidence that one did so &quot;while&quot; the Russian deal was occurring. The bulk of the $145 million in donations came two years before the deal.&quot;</p>

<p>Now why would 9 people related to this company donate $145 million to a charity? Do they have a history of charitable donations? Assuming they do, why would they donate that much to an American based charity? Why not one closer to home or, better yet, donate directly to the source to optimize the donations? Lastly, why did 9 different people suddenly have a crisis of conscience and donate at the same time?</p>

<p>So far, nobody has been able to provide a reasonable explanation for this, which is the most suspicious aspect of it all. It just doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>Also, those crying &quot;we sold 20% of our Uranium to Russia&quot; are very wrong:</p>

<p>&quot;Trump’s reference was to Russia’s nuclear power agency buying a controlling interest in a Toronto-based company. That company has mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity (not produced uranium). The United States doesn’t actually produce all that much uranium (about 2 percent in 2015) and is actually a net importer of the chemical, according to Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at Middlebury Institute and former director at the New America Foundation. More importantly, Russia doesn’t have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States, Oilprice.org pointed out, &quot;so it’s somewhat disingenuous to say this uranium is now Russia’s, to do with what it pleases.&quot; The Kremlin was likely more interested in Uranium One’s assets in Kazakhstan, the world’s largest producer.&quot; <a href="http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2017/feb/16/donald-trump-repeats-his-mostly-false-claim-about-/">source 1</a> | <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-inaccurately-suggests-clinton-got-pai/">source 2</a></p>

<p>Lastly, just to reiterate, the $145 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation by 9 people related to the company stinks to high heaven. <em>That&#39;s</em> the real issue here. </p>

<p>See, that&#39;s the thing. I can fully imagine that individuals around the globe with interests before the United States believed that donating to the Clinton Foundation would improve their standing with the government.  I really haven&#39;t seen any evidence whatsoever that these donations actually led to political favors, and the media was looking <em>hard</em> in 2016 for examples.  Those $145 million seem suspicious, but the Foundation also raised literally billions of dollars and was headlined by a former president, one of the most prominent people on the planet.  It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if the Clintons maybe hinted or played up the possibility that donations might curry favor with the U.S., even if they didn&#39;t actually do anything.  I can imagine them doing the same thing with their private speeches -- they clearly wanted to bank as much cash on their fame as they could, but they&#39;ve also always been smart about not technically violating laws, given how much scrutiny they&#39;re under.  I can totally see Bill, especially, hinted noncommittally that it couldn&#39;t <em>hurt</em> to pony up some cash, without ever making any direct promises or actually intending to intercede on people&#39;s behalves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an avalanche of publicly available evidence.</p>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1530025/7444783">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1530025/7444783</a></p>

<p>Look at this image:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/TZrYgtb.png">https://i.imgur.com/TZrYgtb.png</a></p>

<p>Search here to replicate it: <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/">https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/</a></p>

<p>It is the proof that started this avalanche of evidence. When the Panama Papers were released, it proved Troika Dialog is a Russian front.</p>

<p><a href="https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=8a5bd4fb-2687-4cdf-9906-0a65f4d8d52b&amp;amp;filingTypeID=1">https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=8a5bd4fb-2687-4cdf-9906-0a65f4d8d52b&amp;amp;filingTypeID=1</a></p>

<p>That is proof John Podesta works for Russia. It is an LD 1 disclosure form. It shows he is getting paid by Troika Dialog.</p>

<p>Big picture, this means that the entire DNC is being kept in power by the Russians with Russian money.</p>

<p>But, it gets worse than that. Ruben Vardanyan has a lot of such companies, like Joule Unlimited that claimed to be able to produce clean energy from cyanobacteria... but was really just a Russian front to pay into the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to get people to listen for ages. The Clinton Foundation is a CIA front that runs pay for play and forensic interruption to keep it&#39;s clients out of jail. The CIA has co-opted resources in Russian energy.</p>

<p>Russia isn&#39;t our enemy, they are controlled by the intelligence community and they have to pay into our protection racket. Meanwhile, the news is in the pocket of our intelligence community and it isn&#39;t meant to inform you, it is used as a tool of policy change where it 1) is always gradually asserting authoritarianism and 2) always hiding the activities of the intelligence community.</p>

<p>This is done according to &quot;Systems Psychodynamics&quot; based on Wilfred Bion&#39;s basic assumption theories.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mygen.com/HistoryofSystemsPsychodynamics-2004.pdf">http://www.mygen.com/HistoryofSystemsPsychodynamics-2004.pdf</a></p>

<p>The evidence is everywhere, but the bare bones are as follows.</p>

<p>Podesta also received 100,000 shares from Joule, over 4 years.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635</a></p>

<p><a href="http://joule-unlimited.com/about/board">http://joule-unlimited.com/about/board</a></p>

<p>That is the board at Joule. All Russian CEOs, including Sberbank, Troika Dialog, Rusnano and Rosatom.</p>

<p>They all worked together to make the Uranium One deal happen.</p>

<p>Chaika is exposed in this documentary that is banned in Russia. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaika_(film)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaika_(film)</a></p>

<p>Yuri Chaika was in put in power by Medvedev, but he indicates to an intelligence analyst that Sergei Ivanov is calling the shots.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/54/5410884_re-insight-russia-head-of-major-criminal-group-arrested.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/54/5410884_re-insight-russia-head-of-major-criminal-group-arrested.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chaika said he has already been under a lot of heat because of the Politkovskaya arrests. He said that he would rather not tell me about the &quot;Chechen mastermind&quot; they arrested. I asked if this was because he was not really a mastermind and Chaika said that &quot;many things needed to be tied up as we head into this election and the end of Putin&#39;s reign.&quot; [I know this is strange, but he kept saying things like, &quot;Ivanov needs to have control over the situation he&#39;s about to enter into.... Ivanov is known for his distance from such situations, so they need to be wrapped up.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is crazy, is that even organized crime won&#39;t go near energy assets, which is a playground that Podesta, Hillary and the DNC have no problem playing in. That is a really interesting point... that they scare the Russian mob.</p>

<p>Either way, these people at the top of Russian politics are very often cooperating with our own intelligence assets. Here is a list:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/mWA3Vd1.png">https://i.imgur.com/mWA3Vd1.png</a> (Preview) Stratfor&#39;s Spreadsheet below:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/attach/178/178954_Contacts%20-%20110516%20-%20Lauren%20Goodrich.xls">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/attach/178/178954_Contacts%20-%20110516%20-%20Lauren%20Goodrich.xls</a></p>

<p>During the course of the Uranium One scandal, Gazprom was also acquiring extraction rights and expanding with more locations and resources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the company builds pipelines around the world and Gazprom wanted the the company, so the owner of the company ended up with his shoulders broken and stuffed into a pipeline. Then they turned on the nat gas and he suffocated while his limbs flew off in the 50 mph nat gas flow.....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The news in the US doesn&#39;t actually educate people on how Russian corruption works because that would elucidate ties to our own government.</p>

<p>And here is how the news tricks you while attempting to appear neutral…</p>

<p>The New York Times and Media Matters work together to “set the goal posts” of this issue:</p>

<p>Cash Flowed to the Clintons Amid Russian Uranium Deal: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html</a></p>

<p>NBC News Just Admitted The NY Times&#39; Story Based On Clinton Cash &quot;Doesn&#39;t Hold Up That Well,&quot; Here&#39;s Why: <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/04/24/nbc-news-just-admitted-the-ny-times-story-based/203412">http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/04/24/nbc-news-just-admitted-the-ny-times-story-based/203412</a></p>

<p>At no point do either of these articles mention some of the most important evidence. They don’t explain Troika Dialog. They don’t explain the Panama Papers. They never get around to addressing the 100,000 shares of Joule vested over 4 years at 25,000 shares per year into Leonidas. However, reading both of these articles, you can feel informed about the issue, while never being able to come to any type of solid conclusion. That is how the news works.</p>

<p>The truth is that the deal started with Kazatomprom and the guy in charge was arrested and jailed for treason, abuse of power, corruption, and embezzling natural resources for his own personal profit. His name was Moukhtar Dzhakishev <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moukhtar_Dzhakishev">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moukhtar_Dzhakishev</a></p>

<p>One country already found this behavior treasonous, and then the same thing was done in America, by selling off US uranium to Uranium One, which is owned by the Russians. US politicians were making millions selling off everyone’s Uranium, including our own.</p>

<p>Why do we not bring democracy to Russia by leaking all of their corruption? The same reason Russia doesn’t do the same thing to us. They have an ongoing financial relationship.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/11/qatar-glencore-to-buy-195-percent-stake-in-russia-state-oil-major-rosneft.html">http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/11/qatar-glencore-to-buy-195-percent-stake-in-russia-state-oil-major-rosneft.html</a></p>

<p>Qatar and Glencore are both involved with the Clintons in questionable ways. Marc Rich, the CEO of Glencore was given a last minute pardon by Bill Clinton, while in office. Ironically, James Comey was the prosecutor. The documents are partially available in the FBI Vault.</p>

<p>Qatar’s US weapon purchases were expanded 1400% after donating to the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>It should trouble every American that this is business as usual. Particularly when the press is in on it.</p>

<p>This is a list of journalists who collaborated with the DNC, to varying degrees, as exposed by Wikileaks:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/TcusKCM.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/TcusKCM.jpg</a></p>

<p>Still, there are other channels of communications than just Podesta’s Gmail account or Hillary’s private server. The Wikileaks list is only a glimpse.</p>

<p>Scandal forced the Podesta Group to amend their past relationships AGAIN and we start to see how things really work in Washington. A lobbying group accepts money from foreign countries and private companies so that they have more of a voice in government and policy than the American voters.</p>

<p>After Donald Trump won the election, the Podesta Group filed the most revealing list, yet, in a form known as ‘Amendment to Registration Statement Pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended.”</p>

<p>This is one piece of that document that shows that lobbying firms make deals with the news to represent their client’s interest. We already know what these conversations look like from Wikileaks; varying degrees of cooperation.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/sxMFlAG.png">http://i.imgur.com/sxMFlAG.png</a></p>

<p>This is the whole document:</p>

<p>So, what is being revealed here is that the Clinton Foundation has taken over for the American Security Council Foundation in looking out for the mining interests in the world. What is scary is that, even according to the State Department Reports, the Kazakhstan mines use slave labor. Glencore uses slave labor. VCS Mining uses slave labor.</p>

<p>THE CLINTONS, BESIDES ALL THIS BRIBERY AND CIA GUN RUNNING AND PARTICIPATION IN THE DRUG TRADE ARE FACILITATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING NETWORKS.</p>

<p>You should be aware of the proven criminal conspiracies that the CIA has subjected American citizens to.</p>

<p>The leaks reveal some interesting things, but interpreting them can be difficult without historical context, so I’ll stick to the easy ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All those intelligence agencies stating it happened isn’t evidence?</p>

<p>Meetings between Trump jr., kushner, manafort etc with Russian officials isn’t evidence?</p>

<p>The fact that russian oil/gas interests got exactly what the Steele Dossier said was part of the deal isn’t evidence? </p>

<p>The fact that our foreign allies said this was happening isn’t evidence?</p>

<p>The fact that the Trump admin has been caught lying on MULTIPLE occasions isn’t evidence?</p>

<p>The fact that Flynn and others resigned over their connections and lies isn’t evidence?</p>

<p>.... it has the same amount of evidence as the Uranium One story. </p>

<p>You and people like you just choose not to accept it. I mean, what evidence of that story being true have YOU personally seen? Haha i’d love to see it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, them stating it is not evidence. They have basically stated they had evidence. The evidence would be documents some paperwork something they could show us. Not just hey we have evidence just listen to us. That was months ago and we still haven&#39;t actually seen diddly squat. And nobody is arrested. But they were sooooooo sure. Even before the investigation. </p>

<p>And I know it&#39;s still ongoing. There&#39;s chance something could be found that actually changes something. But my point is it&#39;s nothing so far even though they told us they had the end all be all last year.</p>

<p>tl;dr Uranium One is the name of a South African company that bought Kazakh mining interests through bribery and the political influence of the Clintons. Later, bought by Frank Giustra’s Canadian company, who then sold the company to Russia. The Podestas got paid. The media won’t cover the severity of the crimes.</p>
