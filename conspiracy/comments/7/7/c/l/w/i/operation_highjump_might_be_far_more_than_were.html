        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Highjump#Afterwards">official story</a> is that in 1946-1947, the Navy launched Operation Highjump and went to Antarctica “to establish the Antarctic research base Little America IV” but ended up having to withdraw &quot;back to the United States in late February 1947, and the expedition was terminated <strong>due to the early approach of winter and worsening weather conditions.”</strong></p>

<p>Again, this is the official story.  Various sources, however, say that those &quot;worsening weather conditions&quot; were in fact Nazi German flying saucers that whipped the shit out of the U.S. Navy fleet that was sent there to investigate what was going on.  After the Nazis lost WWII, it&#39;s said that they went to Antarctica, set up a base of operations there called “Neuschwabenland”, poured the remainder of the money they had into flying craft technology, mastered that technology, and when the U.S. sent Admiral Richard E. Byrd there to investigate what was going on and “whip some Nazi ass!”, Byrd went over there with conventional war planes and ships to fight…and his army got absolutely decimated in super short order by the flying craft that the German army had by that time developed.</p>

<p>After witnessing what these vehicles did to his fleet, Byrd hurriedly came back with his tail between his legs and said something like <em>“The next great war on this planet will be fought not with conventional weaponry, but with vehicles that can fly from pole to pole in mere minutes.”</em></p>

<p>It’s said that the German military that went to Neuschwabenland developed craft that not only effortlessly decimated the U.S. war machine when they were engaged, but that cadre of Germans ultimately became spacefaring, and have since that time <em>been</em> in space - travelling from planet to planet, all around this solar system and beyond, dealing with countless amounts of extraterrestrial species.</p>

<p>Sounds unbelievable, but more and more sources continue coming out with information confirming these very things.</p>

<p>Marine Captain Randy Cramer, Corey Goode, Kevan Trimmell, Andrew Basiago, Elena Kapulnik, and Dr. Michael Sala are just a few of a growing number of individuals who have all come out detailing this information.</p>

<p>They didn’t have it then.  They hadn’t quite developed it yet.  It was on its way, but it wasn’t fully developed by the time the Allied Forces won the war.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Just finished watching a doc where a presenter (forget his name) said (paraphrasing) “If the Germans would have gotten the development of their craft done on time, they would have won the war quite easily.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Would the top Nazi scientists that were bought to the usa not have been working on this technology for the nazis?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The technology was only starting to get developed toward the end of WWII.  It wasn’t realized until later after Germany had already lost and the Nazi party got banished and done away with.  It was only after the Nazis ended up in Neuschwabenland in the Antarctic that they poured all their remaining funds into the craft and actually succeeded at the project.</p>

<p>See what you’re doing?  You’re assuming you know the answers to things and hubristically going with that false information - information you think is right but is in fact rather mistaken.  You then keep going with that mistaken information and keep running with it, making even more mistakes since you started off on the wrong foot.</p>

<p>Stop assuming.  It only digs you deeper in the hole you initially dug.  Doesn’t do you any favors that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why didn&#39;t werner von braun and the other scientists develop American tech the same way, assuming as they were the cream of the crop so to speak that they were on the cutting edge of German tech?</p>

<p>So you have this technology just perfected and then you go on to use rocket propulsion  and create yourself a lot more work? Makes sense.</p>

<p>I do not assume to know the answers at all, there have always been kooks in science. What I do state is common seems, where are these machines you talk of? I was trying to be a little pedantic with some of what I said, you can&#39;t go of into the realms of speculation.</p>

<p>Even at the end of the war, these craft if real would have obliterated the forces of warfare at that time,so the war would not have been over and I assume the people that were flying them would have been the creme de la creme with the ideals that go with that. Do they kicked the butt of a 5000 naval force and then went and his away,right lmao.</p>

<p>Please show me some facts in relation to your claims, a good hard solid craft will do, not something from someone&#39;s imagination on what they believe the nazis were working on. I used to play call of duty 5, that doesn&#39;t make nazi zombies real. </p>

<p>I&#39;m open to anything, just show me some proof,documents, real working craft etc. We know all governments create huge paper tails for this type of stuff, where are they?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t be bothered to go into the rest of your points purely because this is all fantasy and there are better things to do with my time. I&#39;m happy for you to believe whatever you like,just don&#39;t try to pass it off as fact when it isn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zero “funny” about my reaction.  And there’s absolutely nothing “pissy” about it either.  I’m simply telling you that I can’t be bothered with people that <em>think</em> they know what they’re talking about when they absolutely and obviously do not.</p>

<p>Again, there’s nothing “pissy” about that.  it’s just a straight, calm, very objective assessment to what you’ve been showing me.  Nothing else.</p>

<p>The fact that people like you aren’t intelligent enough to understand that that’s what it is and that’s what’s going on is an indication that actually proves my very point and proves what I said/how I responded.

<p>I don’t think you understand how history works.  The Nazi regime came across data that helped them significantly in areas of propulsion technology.  I’d tell you to watch the entire show from <a href="https://www.gaia.com/video/german-flying-saucers?fullplayer=preview">this trailer</a>, but it involves paying at least one dollar, and I wouldn’t expect you to be willing to do that (money’s money - no /s).  That said, the information in the trailer alone easily and entirely refutes what you just posted here in this first paragraph of yours.</p>

<p>They put literally <em>all</em> the money they had remaining into technologies that they were <em>already</em> pretty far along in completing.</p>

<p>We live in a prison planet, my friend.  There is far, far more that is actually available to the secret space programs than the civilian population have any idea whatsoever about.</p>

<p>Did you read the OP I posted above?  Someone surely DID notice all the activity going on in Antarctica.  The U.S. did, and they sent Admiral Byrd there to “whip German ass!”</p>

<p>Byrd came back with his tail between his legs because the Nazis were far enough along in the development of their craft by then.</p>

<p>After Hitler died, and the Nazi regime ended, why would the scientists (who were more or less forced to work for the Nazi party) continue their loyalty to the party? Why not defect to the Americans and go work for Nasa like they actually did?</p>

<p>You come on here with an attitude thinking you’re knowing what you’re talking about and you post as if you’re trying to belittle or disprove me when what you should be doing is simply wondering and asking basic questions without the shit head tone that you started off in.</p>

<p>Then you wouldn’t look so fucking stupid when you’re stupid questions get illustrated to <em>be</em> as stupid as they are.  Jesus.  Some people.</p>

<p>Anyway, to respond to your dumb ass statement that I quoted above here, they didn’t have to lug UFOs to Antarctica (facepalm).  They <em>made them once they got there.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Jesus.  Bro.  Hitler wasn’t the only strong arm in Germany.  It’s not like there weren’t other generals, etc that still had a shit ton of power and were loyal to the Nazi party.  Regardless, even if all the scientists that <em>started</em> the program were already gone, there was already at that point <em>enough</em> tech and equations, etc that had been figured out for those that were still there and loyal to the Nazi party to simply continue the work.</p>

<p>How is that so difficult for you to understand?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why not defect to the Americans and go work for Nasa like they actually did?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol.  NASA?  Yeah…NASA as in “Never-A-Straight-Answer” Nasa?  Yeah.  smh</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would the Nazis be handed special information from a higher intellectual being?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, why not?</p>

<p>Second of all, it was understood that objectively speaking, the Germans had a pretty superior industrial engine compared to almost anyone else on the planet circa WWII.  I wouldn’t be surprised if a higher intellectual species could have done a survey of the planet and said “Hey, these cats in Germany seem to be a bit ahead of the curve industrially and technologically speaking.  Let’s go down there and talk to them and maybe give them just a little push forward, and hopefully they’ll use it for good.”</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem that the Nazis did use the information for good, but the point is that any intelligent Earth human (emphasis on “intelligent”) can see why an off world intelligence could see the German industrial apparatus as having the potential to take things even further with a technological push from an outside source.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And what about the energy need for this revolutionary piece of aviation technology? Did the nazis secretly master nuclear energy, but let the Americans get to it first?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that you think it’s nuclear energy that’s the “revolutionary piece of aviation technology” shows that you’re still pretty way behind the curve, man.  Catch up.</p>

<p>Either way, I’ll tell you what.  I’m done with this stupid bickering back and forth.  It’s, again, stupid.  If you decide you want to respond back and continue on with this same inane, childish bickering tone that you have shown from the beginning, then you might as well save your typing for another post because I simply won’t even bother reading your post and you’ll just have typed whatever you type out all for absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>If you’re going to respond back, be courteous and considerate, and I’ll respond in kind.  Otherwise, gtfo.</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you think the data that exists was gotten from just <em>one</em> source, then you&#39;re simply doing it way, way wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a conspiracy board, nothing in here is fact</p>

<p>If that&#39;s the case, then what you yourself are saying right here is full of shit as well.</p>

<p>Be careful with your unqualified universal proclamations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s pure stupidity on your part to be as ignorant as you are of the data that exists and yet continue thinking as simplistically as you are.  You and the other user in this OP that&#39;s just as clueless should maybe both get a room.</p>

<p>According to what I’ve come across, they absolutely <em>didn’t</em> stay dormant.  What I said above in the OP states what they did.  They took off.  They went “out there” - off planet.  That’s where they’re said to have been ever since they developed the ability to go off planet.  Again, they didn’t stay dormant in the Arctic region.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why not exact your power across the globe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I understand, they realized there are <em>much</em> bigger fish outside of planet Earth - and went off planet instead of staying here.</p>

<p>Perhaps it might have been sort of like someone getting presented with the option of being able to make $100 if they tried to take revenge on the person who beat them up last month, or keep working on this other project they have, and make $100,000 or more if they just move on and go to other things.</p>

<p>It would seem that saying “Meh.  Fuck it.  We got bigger fish to fry.” and moving past the $100 option and into the $100K+ option is the way to go as far as I can see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why take your tech into space and visit other planets without securing your home world first?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only did my above response address this, but I will also say that - as far as I can assess based on the information I’ve come across - planet Earth is already pretty heavily visited and inhabited by other species that are no less intelligent than humans (and in some cases, far more intelligent), and if the covert German space program would have decided to attempt a war to take over the entire planet (as they did in WWII), they likely might have had to contend with not just human resistance here on Earth, but being resisted by other non-human beings (both from Earth and not from Earth) as well - and that might present an obstacle that, although possibly not insurmountable for the covert German space program, might have ultimately been more trouble than it was worth.</p>

<p>Again, you either get $100 if you stay here on Earth and fight the entire planet and deal with all the global resistance you would inevitably encounter in the process - not an insignificant portion of which might actually have their own impressive defenses - or you get $100K or far more if you just say “fuck it”, leave, go off planet, and deal with all the possible riches and booty out there without having to be bothered with the resistance that you’d meet on Earth.  Not that they wouldn’t meet resistance “out there”.  There’s data indicating that it’s not super easy going away from Earth as well.  However, I can see how the prospects would be better abroad.</p>

<p>Responded above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having an issue believing this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thinking it through logically and listening to a <em>looot</em> of testimony from different individuals relating to this particular issue has allowed me to not have too great an issue understanding the possible validity of all of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think there is SOMETHING in the arctic that is more than we&#39;re lead to believe, but this is reaching pretty far.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly seems “reaching pretty far” if you haven’t done the research.  Yeah, I imagine it definitely would.  However, if you <em>do</em> do the research, then more things begin making sense.</p>

<p>At least they have for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They already had a significant amount of the technology developed by the time they went to the Antarctic.</p>

<p>They were said to have buried far underneath the ice and set up camp there, so the environment ultimately wasn&#39;t very inhospitable at all since they were underground away from the cold.</p>

<p>Additionally, as I mentioned in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/77clwi/operation_highjump_might_be_far_more_than_were/dolsmsv/?context=3">this response</a> (definitely look at the trailer linked as well, as it responds to what you&#39;re stating here), the Nazi technological war machine was indeed actually significantly ahead of the Allied Powers.  They weren&#39;t <em>so</em> far ahead that they had everything figured out before they were defeated, however.</p>

<p>What?  They were <em>allowed</em> to go, you doof. lol</p>

<p>That was part of the deal the Nazis made w/the Allied Powers.</p>

<p>If that was your “biggest flaw”, then you essentially have no argument, man.  So just stop.</p>

<p>God…are you…Are you really listening to yourself?  You’re not even making sense and yet you’re posting as if you think you are.  Come the fuck on, man.  Don’t come on here thinking you know what you’re talking about when you’re not making any sense.  That’s just fucking stupid.</p>

<p>You come on here with an attitude thinking you’re knowing what you’re talking about and you post as if you’re trying to belittle or disprove me when what you should be doing is simply wondering and asking basic questions without the shit head tone that you started off in.</p>

<p>Then you wouldn’t look so fucking stupid when you’re stupid questions get illustrated to <em>be</em> as stupid as they are.  Jesus.  Some people.</p>

<p>Anyway, to respond to your dumb ass statement that I quoted above here, they didn’t have to lug UFOs to Antarctica (facepalm).  They <em>made them once they got there.</em></p>

<p>Jesus.  Bro.  Hitler wasn’t the only strong arm in Germany.  It’s not like there weren’t other generals, etc that still had a shit ton of power and were loyal to the Nazi party.  Regardless, even if all the scientists that <em>started</em> the program were already gone, there was already at that point <em>enough</em> tech and equations, etc that had been figured out for those that were still there and loyal to the Nazi party to simply continue the work.</p>

<p>How is that so difficult for you to understand?</p>

<p>lol.  NASA?  Yeah…NASA as in “Never-A-Straight-Answer” Nasa?  Yeah.  smh</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would the Nazis be handed special information from a higher intellectual being?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, why not?</p>

<p>Second of all, it was understood that objectively speaking, the Germans had a pretty superior industrial engine compared to almost anyone else on the planet circa WWII.  I wouldn’t be surprised if a higher intellectual species could have done a survey of the planet and said “Hey, these cats in Germany seem to be a bit ahead of the curve industrially and technologically speaking.  Let’s go down there and talk to them and maybe give them just a little push forward, and hopefully they’ll use it for good.”</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem that the Nazis did use the information for good, but the point is that any intelligent Earth human (emphasis on “intelligent”) can see why an off world intelligence could see the German industrial apparatus as having the potential to take things even further with a technological push from an outside source.</p>

<p>The fact that you think it’s nuclear energy that’s the “revolutionary piece of aviation technology” shows that you’re still pretty way behind the curve, man.  Catch up.</p>

<p>Either way, I’ll tell you what.  I’m done with this stupid bickering back and forth.  It’s, again, stupid.  If you decide you want to respond back and continue on with this same inane, childish bickering tone that you have shown from the beginning, then you might as well save your typing for another post because I simply won’t even bother reading your post and you’ll just have typed whatever you type out all for absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>If you’re going to respond back, be courteous and considerate, and I’ll respond in kind.  Otherwise, gtfo.</p>
