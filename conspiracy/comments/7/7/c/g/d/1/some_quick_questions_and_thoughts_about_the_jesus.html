        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">40</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-19 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ponyrojo.html">ponyrojo</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just got finished watching the Jesus Campos interview, </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/F7gj1FoRIfE">https://youtu.be/F7gj1FoRIfE</a></p>

<p>and I have some quick questions that other people might have answers to</p>

<p>1) Campos was called to check on a door that was left open.  When he approached the door on the 32nd floor, it wouldn&#39;t open.  So, where is the open door he was supposed to check on?</p>

<p>2) @ 1:28 - Does the fact that Ellen just casually reachs back for detailed map of the hotel floor and a pointer strike anyone else as odd. Also humorous.  But odd?</p>

<p>3) @ 2:18 - Campos says that he mistook gunfire for drilling sounds.  That would mean Stephen Paddock had started firing out the window before Paddock shot Campos.  But, that&#39;s a direct contradition of the (current) timeline?  Also, assuming Paddock was firing a weapon, how could he hear the sound of a door slam outside his hotel room over the sound of gunfire?</p>

<p>4) Supposedly Paddock had a camera outside of his room.  Wouldn&#39;t that tip him off more than a slamming door?  Also, where was Paddock receiving that video feed, did he have a laptop or computer set up in the room?  And does Campos make any mention of the cart outside Paddock&#39;s room?</p>

<p>5) @ 3:12 - Campos called in on his radio that shots had been fired, but he didn&#39;t tell anyone he had been shot so he could clear radio traffic so they could coordinate the rest of the call.  What in God&#39;s Holy Name is he blathering about?  </p>

<p>6) @ 3:25 - Paddock supposedly shot through the door at Campos.  Does that mean Campos never had eyes on the shooter?  Campos wouldn&#39;t be able to verify Paddock as the actual shooter?</p>

<p>7) Is anyone else bothered that Jesus Campos and Stephen Schuck have eerily similar suits on?</p>

<p>8) Did Stephen Schuck not hear any of rounds that were reportedly fired at Campos?</p>

<p>9) @ 4:58 - Somebody find that guest who Campos told to get back in her room, I want to see an interview with her!</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s my thoughts and questions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To discuss what course of action to take about SHOTS FIRED BEING REPORTED IN THEIR HOTEL WHICH HE CLEARLY STATES HE REPORTED.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why you all are acting like one of their security guards reporting someone is shooting a gun is a non event.  Really?  </p>

<p>&quot;Why would he need to clear the radio when all he did was report that some nut is firing an automatic weapon!?&quot;</p>

<p>Do you realize how stupid you sound?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Campos was called to check on a door that was left open.  When he approached the door on the 32nd floor, it wouldn&#39;t open.  So, where is the open door he was supposed to check on?</p>

<p>It was a room door, dumbass.  Quit misconstruing facts.</p>

<p>2) @ 1:28 - Does the fact that Ellen just casually reachs back for detailed map of the hotel floor and a pointer strike anyone else as odd. Also humorous.  But odd?</p>

<p>Definitely weird but not surprising.  Ellen is a sociopath media puppet, what do you expect?</p>

<p>3) @ 2:18 - Campos says that he mistook gunfire for drilling sounds.  That would mean Stephen Paddock had started firing out the window before Paddock shot Campos.  But, that&#39;s a direct contradition of the (current) timeline?  Also, assuming Paddock was firing a weapon, how could he hear the sound of a door slam outside his hotel room over the sound of gunfire?</p>

<p>This is a complete lie.  Campos mistook the gun being fired with the intent to kill him as drilling sounds.  Paddock was shooting at him.  I have no idea what screws are loose in your head that you can come to the conclusion he must&#39;ve been firing elsewhere when Campos clearly states he was being shot at and mistook that for drilling.</p>

<p>4) Supposedly Paddock had a camera outside of his room.  Wouldn&#39;t that tip him off more than a slamming door?  Also, where was Paddock receiving that video feed, did he have a laptop or computer set up in the room?  And does Campos make any mention of the cart outside Paddock&#39;s room?</p>

<p>Campos wasn&#39;t aware of the cameras.  He isn&#39;t a psychic.  He&#39;s explaining his thought process during the event.  Not being aware of the cameras he assumed the only logical thing, that the door slamming must&#39;ve alerted paddock.  Obviously he assumed wrong because he wasn&#39;t fully aware of what was going on.</p>

<p>6) @ 3:25 - Paddock supposedly shot through the door at Campos.  Does that mean Campos never had eyes on the shooter?  Campos wouldn&#39;t be able to verify Paddock as the actual shooter?</p>

<p>What point are you trying to make with this?  No one&#39;s trying to use Campos as an eye witness to point the finger at paddock.</p>

<p>7) Is anyone else bothered that Jesus Campos and Stephen Schuck have eerily similar suits on?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>8) Did Stephen Schuck not hear any of rounds that were reportedly fired at Campos?</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t mention it.</p>

<li><p>He said he gets notifications about a door being ajar doesn&#39;t mention checking any door ajar and after the stairwell/fire exit check calls it in and proceeds to leave, no mention of checking a door that is ajar only the stairwell with a metal bracket holding it.</p></li>
<li><p>He said as he was leaving the stairwell area and he heard what he took to be &quot;drilling sounds&quot;. Halfway down the hallway is when he says he heard Rapid gun fire.&quot; Two different incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>No he didn&#39;t mention it he only vaguely says he could feel pressure from bullets behind his head. Shuck also said he heard what he thought was a jack hammer &quot;I believe outside it wasn&#39;t in the hallway yet.&quot;</p></li>
