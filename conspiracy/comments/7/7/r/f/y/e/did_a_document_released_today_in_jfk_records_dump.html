        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/C06474968.pdf">This</a> document dropped on <a href="https://twitter.com/LarrySabato/status/921447526565318657">Larry Subato&#39;s feed today</a> caught my eye. At the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ejwb8">top of the page there are biographical details</a> of PJM and other items of note listed including:</p>

<ol>
<li>&quot;Pseudo or crypt may be used instead of true name&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;McMillan&quot; is written and then dates and newspapers are listed, possibly a resume of her previous positions. <a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKjohnsonPR.htm">PJM is known to have written for the Washington Evening Star</a> which is listed and PJM also worked for the North American Newspaper Alliance or NANA which is well-known as a front for CIA. </li>
<li>Also the date of birth written, 7/19/28, is PJM&#39;s DOB. </li>
</ol>

<p>At the bottom of this one-page document <a href="https://imgur.com/a/1wCuv">we see</a> the real interesting stuff. </p>

<ol>
<li>&quot;QK OPERA&quot; is written. <a href="http://www.worldintelligencereview.com/post/681298268">QK OPERA</a> was the covert funding of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_for_Cultural_Freedom">Congress for Cultural Freedom</a> by CIA. Here&#39;s Historian Frances Stonor Saunders in 1999 writing about the influence of the CCF: &quot;Whether they liked it or not, whether they knew it or not, there were few writers, poets, artists, historians, scientists, or critics in postwar Europe whose names were not in some way linked to this covert enterprise&quot;</li>
<li>Most revealingly in terms of PJM&#39;s link to CIA, which she <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/11/the-only-person-who-knew-both-kennedy-and-his-killer/281712/">continues to deny any association with</a> other than having <a href="https://www.realhistoryarchives.com/collections/assassinations/jfk/pmcmil1.htm">met with CIA</a>, there is this final detail from the document: &quot;do employ Johnson as news editor-writer (...) Richard Pipes recommended for position&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pipes">Richard Pipes</a> was director of Harvard&#39;s Russian research center (PJM famously met Oswald in Russia and had deep ties to the country) from 1958-1996. More to the point, in 1976 Pipes was part of Team B, arranged by CIA director George H.W. Bush and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, which engaged in a competitive analysis exercise against Team A, a group of CIA intelligence officials. The goal was to try and assess the Soviet Union&#39;s military capabilities.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/25/home/contents.html">Pipes and PJM have further connections</a> including as colleagues at the New York Review of Books in 1997 and again their bylines crossed in 1961 when both wrote for <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1961/05/">Harpers</a>. Also <a href="https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=33010&amp;amp;relPageId=2">this declassified CIA memo</a> mentions Pipes&#39; reference for PJM for &quot;position Soviet survey&quot;.</p>

<p>So can anyone debunk? I know there&#39;s a lot of smoke out there about PJM being CIA but I haven&#39;t seen anything this explicit before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other thread is being strangely psy-oped. It&#39;s almost common researcher knowledge by this time that an imposter Oswald visited the soviet embassy in Mexico, but you have a poster in that thread, ostensibly reading the docs, and naively positing &quot;hey I think the docs prove the FBI suspected the CIA of covering up a Soviet-Oswald connection.&quot; Not knowing there is no Soviet connectjon, just one IN SHOW. People waiting for the docs can&#39;t be manipulated into falling for any bs Mexico Oswald bullshit they&#39;ll try to hone in on to distract</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you <a href="/u/A_R_K_S">/u/A_R_K_S</a> and <a href="/u/Spin1">/u/Spin1</a> I just registered for the <a href="https://deeppoliticsforum.com/forums/showthread.php?16598-National-Archives-releases-first-batch-of-2017-JFK-documents#.WeuNK1tSzcc">Deep Politics forum</a> which has been discussing this NARA releases and there&#39;s a deeply fascinating thread about discoveries in the NARA docs there that show that <a href="https://deeppoliticsforum.com/forums/showthread.php?16605-NARA-2017-bombshell-Dallas-Mayor-Earle-Cabell-was-a-CIA-asset#.WeuLVltSzcc">Dallas mayor on 11/22/63 Earle Cabell was a CIA agent</a>. Earle Cabell&#39;s brother, of course, was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_P._Cabell">Charles Cabell</a>. From Charles Cabell&#39;s wikipedia:</p>

<p>&quot;Cabell became Deputy Director of CIA under Allen Dulles. He was forced by President Kennedy to resign, on January 31, 1962, following the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion.[2] Cabell&#39;s brother, Earle Cabell, was Mayor of Dallas when Kennedy visited that city and was assassinated, on November 22, 1963.&quot;</p>

<p>I am waiting for an email from the mods there for my account to be confirmed but if anyone has a suggestion for a good forum to talk about this stuff I&#39;m more than interested in participating.

<p>During the Cold War the CIA conducted an offensive against the overwhelming Communist-dominated intelligensia in Europe. Codenamed QK/OPERA it amounted to the covert funding of an organisation, the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which held conferences and subsidised the circulation of dozens of magazines and journals that otherwise would never have been viable

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah sorry I thought I&#39;d linked to something else that mentioned NANA being CIA but it looks like I didn&#39;t so <a href="http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/topic/7602-north-american-newspaper-alliance-nana/">this</a> piece written by William Kelly and John Judge has a pretty good chronicle of NANA and also goes into the background of PJM&#39;s association with NANA. </p>

<p>There&#39;s tons out there about NANA and intelligence agencies and if you look around you&#39;ll find articles connecting elements of intelligence like <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/before-the-cia-there-was-the-pond/">&quot;the Pond&quot;</a> which was a WWII intelligence organization that was U.S.-only and operated under the cover of multi-national corporations. From the article:</p>

<p>&quot;Ruth Fischer, code-named &quot;Alice Miller,&quot; was considered a key Pond agent for eight years, working under her cover as a correspondent, including for the North American Newspaper Alliance. She had been a leader of Germany&#39;s prewar Communist Party and was valuable to the Pond in the early years of the Cold War, pooling intelligence from Stalinists, Marxists and socialists in Europe, Africa and China, according to the newly released documents.&quot;</p>

<p>So NANA  was a common cover for journalists who were spies. Ernest Hemingway, even, <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/03/16/how-the-soviets-once-recruited-ernest-hemingway-to-be-a-spy/">worked for NANA</a> when he was covering the Spanish Civil War in 1937.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. That&#39;s a link to Twitter which then i guess links somewhere that then maybe links to the cia website? </p>

<p>When the cia does releases they provide direct links to their website. Like this  <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/foreign-broadcast-information-service-history-part-1-1941-1947">https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/foreign-broadcast-information-service-history-part-1-1941-1947</a></p>

<p>Credibility plays a large role in this type if stuff. When people hear &quot;cia file dump on Kennedy assassination&quot; they will respond a lot better to cia.gov links. </p>

<p>I think this whole uproar about the Kennedy files brings released when it has been established for a long time that they would be released. </p>

<p>Before all this, if i remember correctly, you could Google &quot;when will kennedy files be released?&quot;  and it would return you info abroad them being released on oct 28, 2017 (ill find a link for that soon im on mobile).  </p>

<p>Now you can&#39;t find any info because its all just fake news about trump releasing this stuff even though it has nothing to do with trump and providing no links to actual cia.gov files. </p>

<p>So you see, by &quot;releasing&quot; this info, they have quite literally done the opposite. This is doublespeak at its finest. There was more readily available on the Kennedy assassination 5 days ago than today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read Sabato&#39;s feed he says he received advance issue of documents not yet released on NARA. I linked NARA&#39;s JFK records page and there&#39;s docs released in July there and I haven&#39;t been able to find the official release of these recent documents either which I agree is frustrating. But if you look in Sabato&#39;s feed he&#39;s released a cache of previously unreleased stuff and that&#39;s where I sourced my document about Johnson McMillan. If I find anything more official I will update.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so to clarify. You have 1 authors release of what he claims to be unreleased cia files..... That&#39;s literally the type of thing that makes people shake their heads at conspiracy theorists. You are providing all the ammo right now to people who think we are stupid. You should take your post down and repost it as &quot;Author Sabato claims to have unreleased cia documents&quot; rather than making the very inaccurate claim that you have a link to cia files. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stand by the title of my post. Sabato is very credible being the Director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.

    <div class="md"><p>And maybe its just my phone. But that link is just to an authors Twitter where he links to his own book. FAR from a cia file dump. More like just 1 authors opinion. Then again, maybe my phone is making an error here. </p>

<p>If you have direct link to an actual cia file regarding kennedy i would be very grateful for a link to it. </p>
