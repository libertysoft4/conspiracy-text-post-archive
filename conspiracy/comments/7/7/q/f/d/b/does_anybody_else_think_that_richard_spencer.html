<p>Spencer and his little Nazi followers seem so obviously fake to me. Just like the neo-Nazis that Soros funded in Ukraine and elsewhere. Spencer strikes me as controlled opposition, whose purpose is to start a race war. Claims to be a Trump supporter, but has done more damage to Trump&#39;s image than anyone else. People would not be so afraid to say they support Trump if they weren&#39;t afraid of being labeled Nazis like Spencer and his dumb sig heiling minions/actors. That whole film was a very effective op. His background is quite suspicious, too... I think CIA </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. His speeches are strategic in location.  He always wants to associate Trump with his movement, which I find odd. Most white supremacist are anti Catholic and anti Jew and Trump has a Jewish son in law and Catholic wife.  Nothing adds up with this guy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure. And he claims to be such a Trump fan, but all he does is make Trump look bad, stir up anti-Trump hysteria, and continue fueling the &quot;Trump supporters are Nazis&quot; narrative. I also find it very strange that the most incriminating stuff he and his followers could possibly do, like freaking sieg heiling each other after the election like a bunch of lunatics and marching around with tiki torches chanting about Jews.... somehow that always manages to get recorded by in crystal clear, professional quality film by CIA-run news orgs like Vice. Like why are news outlets invited to events like the crazy tiki torch march but no one else who attended that protest knew about the march? It was an exclusive, secret march supposedly... yet Vice was invited? It&#39;s just so obviously fake </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was absolutely thinking Spencer, and many of his supporters, are part of some op.  </p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/10/20/richard_spencer_supporters_arrested_for_attempted_murder_in_gainesville.html">this story</a> about 3 Spencer supporters being arrested.  Two of them egged on the other to shoot his gun at protesters.  That strikes me as COINTELPRO agent provocateur behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! I was just seeing that story pop up all over my fb too which is why I was driven to post this theory again. I&#39;d been thinking this about Spencer for a while, then Charlottesville with the tiki torches just like other Soros ops made it pretty obvious this shit is all staged. And now, once again, there are these ridiculous Nazis fighting people in the news. Like who are these guys? No one ever knows them. Their background stories never check out. It&#39;s all just so cinematic and perfect for the establishment narrative when this stuff happens. Maybe there&#39;s a small number of alt right people who are awful enough to actually like/follow Spencer and who don&#39;t see how they&#39;re being used, but for the most part I think the vast majority of these &quot;Nazis&quot; are hired and Spencer absolutely is working for the CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. They push him on the public so hard. I guess they do that with anything that they think will make Trump look bad though. But the Spencer stuff is different because he knows he&#39;s making Trump look bad, yet we&#39;re supposed to believe he actually supports Trump? And his background and family connections... so suspicious </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? CIA has done all the most evil shit throughout history and are the ones with all the main connections to the gloablists like bezos and soros. CIA was using Clinton Foundation as a front,  trafficking weapons and people, laundering money, toppling regimes, and George Webb&#39;s research showed that CIA plan was to create basically a race war in the US next.

    <div class="md"><p>Come on, man. What are you even doing in a conspiracy sub if your thinking doesn&#39;t extend beyond the most mainstream, heavily pushed narratives we hear on every news channel and read in every newspaper, everyday? I mean the second sentence you wrote is word for word what the &quot;commentators&quot; on all of the mainstream news channels have been saying for over a year now... Do you actually believe that? If so, then again I wonder what brings you to a conspiracy sub of all places- one of the only forums where you don&#39;t expect to see blind acceptance of the mainstream arguments. If that&#39;s what you believe and that&#39;s all that you want to even consider being possible, then you can post pretty much anywhere else on the internet about how Trump is magically sprouting white supremacists across the land and everyone will eat it up. But in this sub, people tend to think a little harder and question a little further. </p>

<p>Yeah, I looked.  One of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/77qfdb/does_anybody_else_think_that_richard_spencer/doo6cyd/">links</a> says that his middle name is BERTRAND like BERTRAND RUSSELL so he must be a MOLE.  At that point, you might as well claim he is actually a logical positivist in disguise.</p>

<p>Another link says he voted for Kerry and local Democrats.  Exactly how does that mean he&#39;s CIA.</p>

<p>Why is it <em>so hard</em> for you guys to realize that Nazis and white supremacists <em>are real things</em>.  They are shouting about themselves everyday all day, and all you can do is play the three monkey&#39;s game and pretend they aren&#39;t real.</p>

<p>Around the time of the Atlantic article showing him throwing up the Nazi salute, I had conversations with people on <a href="/r/Ask_Trumpsupporters">/r/Ask_Trumpsupporters</a> in which he was defended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok well I appreciate that you&#39;re discussing this like a rational person rather than calling me crazy, racist, etc.. I&#39;m not posting them here, but I have other sources that haven&#39;t been posted yet. I will try to post them later. But what I&#39;ll say is there is something... a lot of things that are off about this guy. The title of my post was a question, not a statement of fact. And I just think he&#39;s working for someone, maybe it&#39;s not the CIA, maybe it&#39;s a different intel org like other commenters have suggested, maybe it&#39;s Soros, maybe it&#39;s Russia, I don&#39;t know.  My larger point is that his shit seems super staged and his entire persona appears to be manufactured and doesn&#39;t align with his family and his past. And all of it is being used to cause a lot of hatred and fighting and chaos, which serves a purpose for certain nefarious institutions whether I can prove they&#39;re orchestrating it directly or not. Either way, it&#39;s benefiting those entities and hurting the American people. Anyway I&#39;m simply raising a question and getting people to consider this possibility. And I&#39;m writing it in a conspiracy sub for discussion, not printing it in a university text book. If this isn&#39;t the forum for these types of questions and discussions then what is? </p>

<p>Also, when my post gets linked in the top of Minds sub then downvoted into oblivion, it certainly raises my suspicions further.

<p>But when one of the pieces of the case for this claim is that he shares a name with a famous British philosopher, it is time to wonder if the case is actually all that strong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My larger point is that his shit seems super staged and his entire persona appears to be manufactured and doesn&#39;t align with his family and his past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How so?  The fact that he voted for Kerry?  He says he didn&#39;t like the Iraq War, a position which is consistent with his American isolationism (and Trump, fwiw).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this isn&#39;t the forum for these types of questions and discussions then what is?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two problems with this.  First, the enthusiasm for speculative and counter-intuitive claims masquerades as an actual <em>argument</em> for these claims.  That&#39;s an issue for many conspiracy theories.  Second, there are people literally shouting that they are nazis, and you&#39;re trying to suggest without evidence they aren&#39;t actually nazis - so we should do nothing about the fact that there is a living, breathing nazi movement in America.  That is one hell of a risk to take, based entirely on a gut feeling.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Or 4) they think your claim is funny.  Look at it this way: an easy way to discredit someone is to make them a laughingstock.  Your theory is that Spencer is a plant, so shouldn&#39;t part of the effect be to make him (and causes associated with him) look ridiculous and therefore funny?  Your own theory entails that this all this funny to someone, somewhere.  Of course, the reasoning in this paragraph is redundant, since it is much easier to say that people just find your claim funny without having to explain that through CIA influence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>late reply but</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been searching for people talking about this because it seems insane to me, something else is going on. Maybe it&#39;s my imagination, but the people he is supposed to represent, the people who march, are usually not fans of homosexuality.</p>

<p>Maybe he is trying to impress daddy, stay in the will or something. That is the most obvious answer, if we use occhams razor.</p>

<p>Or he&#39;s CIA. But to me sending Spencer in to the white supremacist movement to subvert it or make it look bad is along the lines of sending Martin Lawrence to Big Momma&#39;s House. It makes you wonder who he is fooling, driving to the hoop like that.</p>
