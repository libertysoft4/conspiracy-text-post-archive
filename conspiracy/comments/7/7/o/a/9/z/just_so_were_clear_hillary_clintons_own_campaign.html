<p>Secretary Clinton’s top vulnerability tested in this poll is the
attack that claims as Secretary of State she signed off on a deal that gave
the Russian government control over twenty percent of America&#39;s uranium
production, after investors in the deal donated over one hundred and forty
million dollars to the Clinton Foundation. Half of all likely voters (53%)
are less likely to support Clinton after hearing that statement and 17% are
much less likely to support her after that statement.</p>

<p>With the ongoing story of Syria and Ukraine, there was already a focus on Russia. So when the media needed a boogeyman for precious Hillary, they were already working on a daily quota of talking down Russia at every opportunity. Thus they then decided to scream bloody murder about Russian influence as if it were some great patriotic tragedy, but they just won&#39;t talk about Saudi influence, or any other foreign influence on the election at all for that matter. And we certainly won&#39;t talk about the US influencing or interfering in anybody else&#39;s elections.</p>

<p>After voters hear a positive profile on both Sanders and O’Malley, Clinton’s lead dops to a seven point margin (44% Clinton, 37% Sanders, 7% O’Malley, 1% Chafee, 2% other and 9% don’t know). However, once voters hear a positive profile on Clinton she re-gains her double-digit lead (+12 points).</p>

<p>OPs find from Podesta email. Look forward to more spinning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secretary Clinton’s top vulnerability tested in this poll is the attack that claims as Secretary of State she signed off on a deal that gave the Russian government control over twenty percent of America&#39;s uranium production, after investors in the deal donated over one hundred and forty million dollars to the Clinton Foundation. Half of all likely voters (53%) are less likely to support Clinton after hearing that statement and 17% are much less likely to support her after that statement. · After voters heard a battery of negatives on Secretary Clinton, their top concern was that she does not seem honest (16%)</p>

She received the least favorable coverage of any Democratic or Republican candidate. In the first half of 2015, there were three negative reports about her for every positive one. In the second half, the ratio was 3:2 negative to positive. Fox led the way, broadcasting 291 negative reports about Clinton and just 39 positive ones.

    <div class="md"><p>What people are saying in emails is interesting, but what actually happens is something different, something real. Harvard released two comprehensive studies, one for 2015 and one for 2016. They found:</p>

<p>In 2015, Bernie received little coverage until the summer when he got a bump of positive coverage. Hillary Clinton received widely negative coverage. </p>

<p>In early 2016, just when the big primaries were coming through, suddenly coverage of Hillary became positive while Bernie coverage went negative. (WaPo went crazy against Bernie with 16 negative stories in 16 hours just when Bernie had his last chance to win the nomination, as covered by FAIR.org.)</p>

<p>Once Hillary became the &quot;presumptive&quot; nominee, coverage of Hillary drifted downward.</p>

<p>In 2015, Donald Trump received unprecedented positive coverage, with lots of of it being uncensored live speech broadcasts. Studies estimated the value of the free Donald Trump coverage was in the billions.</p>

<p>In 2016, Donald Trump still got massive free coverage, but it became more negative.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t look at Daily Caller, Breitbart, Reason, Fee.org, Big League Politics, Heritage, National Review, or the thousand other <em>solidly</em> partisan Republican publications either, many of which publish under the financial auspices of a small number of billionaires. </p>

<p>If you say there was collusion, that point holds. As it turns out, it did not translate into positive coverage for Hillary, except at that convenient time when Bernie needed to be defeated. </p>

Bernie was hounded on EVERY DAY, especially by CIA sources (I mean &quot;independent news sources&quot;) like WaPo. WaPo put out like 20 anti-Bernie articles a day. Every other site was using flawed delegate counts to make it look like Bernie was impossibly behind - even when he was ahead. It was clear that even if Bernie won the primaries, the superdelegates openly said they would steal the primaries for Hillary because that is their &quot;role&quot;. Remember Howard Dean and others? </p>

<p>And elite schools like Harvard pump out Illuminati like nothing else.</p>
