    <div class="md"><p>Why aren&#39;t you instead asking where is <em>at least</em> the same level of evidence for Trump-Russia? And don&#39;t say the investigation is ongoing because they have been claiming to have the end all be all of dirt since last year. And are you also saying that the evidence for Obama admin- Russia is weak?  I could argue trump-Russia evidence is much weaker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be a little more complicated. I definitely agree that this sub is full of t_d idiots who think Trump is on their side, but that doesn&#39;t mean the whole thing is buttoned up. </p>

<p>My take on TPTB is fairly simply. For as long as there have been people there have been people willing to murder and steal to gain power. They are the warrior class, the aristocracy. Democracy didn&#39;t make them disappear, they just adapted. That&#39;s why they killed Socrates.</p>

<p>But they aren&#39;t on the same side. It&#39;s every man for himself, because they are all psychopaths. Trump can be genuinely trying to crack open a large conspiracy of which he has no part. Or not. Maybe he is part of it. But the details are real. </p>

<p>Clinton really did sell control of some uranium for kickbacks. We should be happy that she is being exposed, and we should push to destroy her and her cronies, even it it helps Trump in the short term.</p>

<p>I also do ignore lots of evidence that could take Trump down because that will just put the neoliberals back in charge.</p>

<p>Trump is an ineffectual fool, and personally I would rather have him as the psychopath-in-chief than Clinton because he sucks at getting away with it. Sometimes the enemy of your enemy has to be your friend for a while. Trumpism won&#39;t last because it lacks the polished finesse of the post-WWI industrial/spy complex. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked into both sides. I&#39;ve done a lot of original research and the Trump/Russia story doesn&#39;t really hold water, but the Uranium One story has independently corroborating evidence across the board.</p>

<p>See this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/TZrYgtb.png">https://i.imgur.com/TZrYgtb.png</a></p>

<p>Replicate it here: <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/">https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/</a></p>

<p>When the Panama Papers were released, it proved Troika Dialog is a Russian front.</p>

<p><a href="https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=8a5bd4fb-2687-4cdf-9906-0a65f4d8d52b&amp;amp;filingTypeID=1">https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=8a5bd4fb-2687-4cdf-9906-0a65f4d8d52b&amp;amp;filingTypeID=1</a></p>

<p>That is proof John Podesta works for Russia. It is an LD 1 disclosure form. It shows he is getting paid by Troika Dialog.</p>

<p>Big picture, this means that the entire DNC is being kept in power by the Russians with Russian money.</p>

<p>But, it gets worse than that. Ruben Vardanyan has a lot of such companies, like Joule Unlimited that claimed to be able to produce clean energy from cyanobacteria... but was really just a Russian front to pay into the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to get people to listen for ages. The Clinton Foundation is a CIA front that runs pay for play and forensic interruption to keep it&#39;s clients out of jail. The CIA has co-opted resources in Russian energy.</p>

<p>Russia isn&#39;t our enemy, they are controlled by the intelligence community and they have to pay into our protection racket. Meanwhile, the news is in the pocket of our intelligence community and it isn&#39;t meant to inform you, it is used as a tool of policy change where it 1) is always gradually asserting authoritarianism and 2) always hiding the activities of the intelligence community.</p>

<p>This is done according to &quot;Systems Psychodynamics&quot; based on Wilfred Bion&#39;s basic assumption theories.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mygen.com/HistoryofSystemsPsychodynamics-2004.pdf">http://www.mygen.com/HistoryofSystemsPsychodynamics-2004.pdf</a></p>

<p>The evidence is everywhere, but the bare bones are as follows.</p>

<p>Podesta also received 100,000 shares from Joule, over 4 years.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635</a></p>

<p><a href="http://joule-unlimited.com/about/board">http://joule-unlimited.com/about/board</a></p>

<p>That is the board at Joule. All Russian CEOs, including Sberbank, Troika Dialog, Rusnano and Rosatom.</p>

<p>They all worked together to make the Uranium One deal happen.</p>

<p>Chaika is exposed in this documentary that is banned in Russia. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaika_(film)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaika_(film)</a></p>

<p>Yuri Chaika was in put in power by Medvedev, but he indicates to an intelligence analyst that Sergei Ivanov is calling the shots.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/54/5410884_re-insight-russia-head-of-major-criminal-group-arrested.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/54/5410884_re-insight-russia-head-of-major-criminal-group-arrested.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chaika said he has already been under a lot of heat because of the Politkovskaya arrests. He said that he would rather not tell me about the &quot;Chechen mastermind&quot; they arrested. I asked if this was because he was not really a mastermind and Chaika said that &quot;many things needed to be tied up as we head into this election and the end of Putin&#39;s reign.&quot; [I know this is strange, but he kept saying things like, &quot;Ivanov needs to have control over the situation he&#39;s about to enter into.... Ivanov is known for his distance from such situations, so they need to be wrapped up.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is crazy, is that even organized crime won&#39;t go near energy assets, which is a playground that Podesta, Hillary and the DNC have no problem playing in. That is a really interesting point... that they scare the Russian mob.</p>

<p>Either way, these people at the top of Russian politics are very often cooperating with our own intelligence assets. Here is a list:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/mWA3Vd1.png">https://i.imgur.com/mWA3Vd1.png</a> (Preview) Stratfor&#39;s Spreadsheet below:</p>

<p>During the course of the Uranium One scandal, Gazprom was also acquiring extraction rights and expanding with more locations and resources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the company builds pipelines around the world and Gazprom wanted the the company, so the owner of the company ended up with his shoulders broken and stuffed into a pipeline. Then they turned on the nat gas and he suffocated while his limbs flew off in the 50 mph nat gas flow.....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The news in the US doesn&#39;t actually educate people on how Russian corruption works because that would elucidate ties to our own government.</p>

<p>And here is how the news tricks you while attempting to appear neutral…</p>

<p>The New York Times and Media Matters work together to “set the goal posts” of this issue:</p>

<p>Cash Flowed to the Clintons Amid Russian Uranium Deal: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html</a></p>

<p>NBC News Just Admitted The NY Times&#39; Story Based On Clinton Cash &quot;Doesn&#39;t Hold Up That Well,&quot; Here&#39;s Why: <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/04/24/nbc-news-just-admitted-the-ny-times-story-based/203412">http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/04/24/nbc-news-just-admitted-the-ny-times-story-based/203412</a></p>

<p>At no point do either of these articles mention some of the most important evidence. They don’t explain Troika Dialog. They don’t explain the Panama Papers. They never get around to addressing the 100,000 shares of Joule vested over 4 years at 25,000 shares per year into Leonidas. However, reading both of these articles, you can feel informed about the issue, while never being able to come to any type of solid conclusion. That is how the news works.</p>

<p>The truth is that the deal started with Kazatomprom and the guy in charge was arrested and jailed for treason, abuse of power, corruption, and embezzling natural resources for his own personal profit. His name was Moukhtar Dzhakishev <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moukhtar_Dzhakishev">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moukhtar_Dzhakishev</a></p>

<p>One country already found this behavior treasonous, and then the same thing was done in America, by selling off US uranium to Uranium One, which is owned by the Russians. US politicians were making millions selling off everyone’s Uranium, including our own.</p>

<p>Why do we not bring democracy to Russia by leaking all of their corruption? The same reason Russia doesn’t do the same thing to us. They have an ongoing financial relationship.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/11/qatar-glencore-to-buy-195-percent-stake-in-russia-state-oil-major-rosneft.html">http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/11/qatar-glencore-to-buy-195-percent-stake-in-russia-state-oil-major-rosneft.html</a></p>

<p>Qatar and Glencore are both involved with the Clintons in questionable ways. Marc Rich, the CEO of Glencore was given a last minute pardon by Bill Clinton, while in office. Ironically, James Comey was the prosecutor. The documents are partially available in the FBI Vault.</p>

<p>Qatar’s US weapon purchases were expanded 1400% after donating to the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>It should trouble every American that this is business as usual. Particularly when the press is in on it.</p>

<p>This is a list of journalists who collaborated with the DNC, to varying degrees, as exposed by Wikileaks:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/TcusKCM.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/TcusKCM.jpg</a></p>

<p>Still, there are other channels of communications than just Podesta’s Gmail account or Hillary’s private server. The Wikileaks list is only a glimpse.</p>

<p>Scandal forced the Podesta Group to amend their past relationships AGAIN and we start to see how things really work in Washington. A lobbying group accepts money from foreign countries and private companies so that they have more of a voice in government and policy than the American voters.</p>

<p>After Donald Trump won the election, the Podesta Group filed the most revealing list, yet, in a form known as ‘Amendment to Registration Statement Pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended.”</p>

<p>This is one piece of that document that shows that lobbying firms make deals with the news to represent their client’s interest. We already know what these conversations look like from Wikileaks; varying degrees of cooperation.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/sxMFlAG.png">http://i.imgur.com/sxMFlAG.png</a></p>

<p>This is the whole document:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fara.gov/docs/5926-Exhibit-AB-20140430-41.pdf">https://www.fara.gov/docs/5926-Exhibit-AB-20140430-41.pdf</a></p>

<p>So, what is being revealed here is that the Clinton Foundation has taken over for the American Security Council Foundation in looking out for the mining interests in the world. What is scary is that, even according to the State Department Reports, the Kazakhstan mines use slave labor. Glencore uses slave labor. VCS Mining uses slave labor.</p>

<p>THE CLINTONS, BESIDES ALL THIS BRIBERY AND CIA GUN RUNNING AND PARTICIPATION IN THE DRUG TRADE ARE FACILITATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING NETWORKS.</p>

<p>You should be aware of the proven criminal conspiracies that the CIA has subjected American citizens to.</p>

<p>The leaks reveal some interesting things, but interpreting them can be difficult without historical context, so I’ll stick to the easy ones.</p>

<p>So this comment struck me and I looked it up. So a plane Howard Dean&#39;s campaign rented in 2004 was used 2 years later. That&#39;s not Howard Dean&#39;s plane. If I rent a car that a dope dealer uses and crashes does that make me a party to the dope dealing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was his campaign plane, but the point is that government uses planes that crash with tons of cocaine.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t just his plane that crashed.</p>

<p>If you sell off ten of your old cars and five of them crash with cocaine, it&#39;s maybe worth looking into.</p>

<p>I get the wording was confusing, but, in the greater context it is a clear indicator of corruption.</p>

<p>Howard Dean used the plane in his campaign. That plane later crashed with cocaine because it was trying to fly under the radar.</p>

<p>If you are interested in CIA planes, the documentation is pretty extensive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then say a plane Howard Dean&#39;s campaign used 2 years prior was a CIA plane, not that Howard Dean&#39;s campaign plane crashed as if it was actually being used for the campaign in anyway during the time of the crash. If you&#39;re going to be so thorough and give all this CIA plane info out, you&#39;re leaving out facts to write your own narrative.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of info. I’m keeping my eye on things as well, just grossed out by the feverish adoring of a scum bag who co-opted the minds of people who voted against their own interests.

<p>For my own part, I&#39;ve seen tons of things that make me suspicious of Hillary and the machine that she is part of. I&#39;ve seen far fewer sketchy things out of Trump, and none nearly so serious. My take is that he hasn&#39;t been in politics long enough or deeply enough to become anywhere close to being as corrupt as Hillary etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to the possibility this will change. But for now, I have no regrets about voting for him, and I hope to see him be the best person and President he&#39;s capable of being, with our help and our holding him accountable where it&#39;s feasible to do so.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt that we have users that just want to troll and make people miserable in this sub. </p>

<p>It also seems like we have a nice collection of posters who look to politics as entertainment. The self-reasoning must be that if it is in their intellect to make a mockery of politics and government, then it is a topic that has been fully mastered. It&#39;s a joke to them because they&#39;ve been &quot;red pilled&quot; beyond our comprehension. So everything is a joke. Everything is just treading along as TPTB have designed. These users are just waiting for the next big thing to happen so that they can lose their shit and quench their thirst for entertainment. </p>

<p>And what did these users get in 2016? The biggest entertainer to grace the presidential race since Reagan. Trump served up zingers and sound bytes to hold these people&#39;s attention. Then he massaged their biases by talking about JFK and then 9/11. He talked about the imprisonment of conspiracy darling Hillary Clinton. To top it off, both communities mentioned above meme&#39;d the fuck out of him. </p>

<p>It truly is remarkable to witness how targeted Trump&#39;s campaign was at sweeping up these poor suckers. </p>

<p>Personally Hilary is someone I would like to see in jail only because I have been following the Clintons for longer.  Dont get me wrong Trump will go after her. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So is it just a T_D brigade or do you think that we may have actual Russian provocateurs amongst us?</p>

<p>My theory is that conspiracy theories are more of a training ground for the Russians. A training ground that also gives them the opportunity to sow confusion and distrust.</p>

<p>Every single mass casually event is spun into a conspiracy theory and blamed on the Government. That&#39;s an extremely high average. There just has to be at least one nut case with a gun who does something stupid all on his own. The Government just can&#39;t be secretly behind them all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I probably have at least some Russian blood in me. I&#39;m a European mutt. My Grandmother rattled off a list when I was a kid.</p>

<p>I guess I should get one of these DNA tests.</p>

<p>My conspiracy theory is that Russians use conspiracy theories for training. It&#39;s all about sticking with the topic and pushing an agenda. If you can get people to buy in on Flat Earth then you shouldn&#39;t have any problems with pushing a political agenda.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take too many people to steer a conversation if that&#39;s what they&#39;re trained to do and they do it through several sock puppet accounts. People are like sheep. If the crowd is believing something then they&#39;ll believe it too since they want to be part of the crowd.</p>

<p>Russian provocateurs would be trained for the job. They would have a KGB education in various forms of manipulation. Logic and criminal thinking. Psychology. Debate. Whatever it takes to be good at what they do.</p>

<p>This sub is full of many different groups. Some people here don&#39;t believe any conspiracy theories. Some people here support Hillary Clinton. Some believe Trump is just crazy enough to make waves. Some hate trump. Some believe the earth is flat. The list goes on. </p>

<p>If you check political posts, anti-Trump comments are frequently at the top of the thread, upvoted into the hundreds, occasionally gilded, and sometimes those top comments claim they will be downvoted for being anti-Trump, yet nobody figures it out. </p>

<p>Some notable examples of the posts that you believe don&#39;t exist:</p>

<p>You have probably noticed that there are more Trump supporting posts than there are anti-Trump posts. That&#39;s obvious because conspiracy theorists tend to support politicians who market themselves as anti-establishment, such as Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Trey Gowdy, Bernie Sanders, etc. However, the actual number of anti Trump people in here is probably 50 percent at least because you have to account for anti-Trump comments hitting the top of those pro-Trump threads again and again, and the fact that anti Trump posts can be number 1 in this sub. What we need to do is stop complaining about a non-issue. Anti-Trumpism usually dominates the comments in this sub. </p>

<p>What actually doesn&#39;t make sense is the huge amount of people in this sub who apparently don&#39;t believe any conspiracy theories. Skepticism is fine and healthy, but what we have are borderline trolls who parrot the official story on numerous topics. If I wanted the official story to be parroted to me, I&#39;d turn on Fox News or CNN. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trump got peed on my a Russian prostitute.  (gross, but nothing really illegal about that)</p></li>
<li><p>Hillary sold 20% of America&#39;s uranium to Russia, and took a USD 145 Million bribe in the process.   (which is treason - very very VERY illegal)</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>This is it. Absolutely every story about trump has been based on leaks, anonymous sources, and shady companies that turn out to have a direct relationship to other very shady organizations.  The Russia scandal, for example, still has not provided a single shred of publicly accessible evidence beyond circumstance and well written journalism. </p>

<p>Clinton, on the other hand, left an actual paper trail with her actual words and the words of her cohorts. </p>

<p>Evidence is the difference. </p>
