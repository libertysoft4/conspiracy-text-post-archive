    <div class="md"><p>He was like 9 during the Nazi incident. He donated hard against Bush and Trump, the biggest fascsists in recent history. What &quot;regime change&quot;? That he hates Trump? I want regime change too, in 2020. The fuck?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t actually like Soros. He has a lot of creepy ideas, and no one should have the power that billionaires have. But I don&#39;t see the evidence that he&#39;s the grand puppetmasters. He&#39;s a liberal billionaire. Try the CIA and the U.S. deep state for your real big picture perpetrators. Soros is a bit player ultimately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I didn&#39;t sing the praises; I just pointed out how he&#39;s no worse than any other billionaire, the word &quot;tyrant&quot; doesn&#39;t apply, and you guys clearly just know nothing about Soros.

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you rush to defend someone like this? Soros 1) needs no help from you but 2) is actively undermining your right to political representation by using financial tools to create a larger echo chamber for their own cause from their position as a private citizen from a foreign country and 3) freely admits he sold out his Jewish neighbors for profit (he was older than 9 you are simply wrong here).</p>

<p>You&#39;re just throwing insults and talking down to people. You may assert &quot;that he does some things that everyone on here would agree are good&quot; but that is just an assumption on your part so frankly your level of discourse seems pretty par for the course on this sub.</p>

<p>I understand that you are angry and disagree but you haven&#39;t presented anything towards your case so I can only assume you are trying to distract from the real issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, he heavily supports criminal justice reform, gives about $4 million a year to marijuana legalization specifically, and I know from a lot of time on this sub that that&#39;s an issue 99% of people support. Soros is probably the most open of the billionaires; he&#39;s written several books and is extremely open about what he believes, hence the name of his foundation. He&#39;s an anti-socialist who supports liberal democracy. I disagree with his anti-socialism and in fact the vast majority of what he says, starting with his bizarre separation of his philanthropy and his money-making speculation work. I&#39;m anti-capitalist; I don&#39;t like people like Soros. But at least I know who he is; it&#39;s clear to me that people on this thread and on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in general for the most part don&#39;t even know the basics and are getting their beliefs from Alex Jones, who spreads outright horseshit to satisfy his own agenda, which is lining his own pocketbook while supporting right-wing populism. Soros is the demon that Jones needed to fulfill his storyline, but why Soros and not the Kock Brothers? Why not Jeff Bezos, who&#39;s worth a lot more than Soros and I would argue is more nefarious and dangerous to democracy? Maybe because Bezos is a little harder to understand. And Soros isn&#39;t funding protests all over the country; that&#39;s outright disinformation. </p>

<p>I *agree that Soros is actively undermining my right to political representation with his big money influencing- really well-put, in fact. But he&#39;s hardly alone in that, and he himself is not the problem. I think Bernie Sanders nailed it- it&#39;s the &quot;billionaire class.&quot; Soros represents a part of the liberal wing of that class. However, he is not a &quot;literal demon,&quot; as Jones likes to say, who&#39;s funding people to bus to protests around the country because he wants to start a &quot;race war.&quot; That&#39;s comical. Actually, the Drug War is extremely classist and racist, and OSI puts out good materials on that subject. I&#39;ve seen the materials. Far from starting a race war, they&#39;ll trying to end one. It&#39;s asinine shit. So to fit his narrative Jones finds this story from Soros&#39; childhood. If you have to go back to childhood, however old he was exactly, you&#39;re stretching in the attempt to brand him a Nazi. You know who the real Nazis are: the Bush family. Who Soros hates. </p>

<p>I mourn the death of nuance.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>UF must allow the free expression of speech. We cannot prohibit groups or individuals from speaking in our public forums except for limited exceptions, which include safety and security.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I find that the threat of a potential emergency is imminent,&quot; Scott declared </p>

<p>No campus group invited Spencer to speak, and the university is not hosting or sponsoring the event. Spencer&#39;s group, the National Policy Institute, is paying the university $10,564 for facility rental and security.</p>

<p>The speech and accompanying protests are also a major expense: The university as well as state and local agencies expect to spend more than $500,000 to provide additional security.</p>

<p>And the University of Florida can&#39;t demand that Spencer pay the full cost of protecting him, because of a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically any group can stir up a storm, and these colleges can&#39;t deny them access on thier campus even knowing there is such a possibility of violence it causes the governor to declare a state of emergency. They can&#39;t charge the offender security costs to protect everyone, which $500k is no small fund, so are forced  to &quot;eat the costs&quot; <a href="https://www.collegefactual.com/chart-images/university-of-florida/paying-for-college/tuition-and-fees/chart-tuition-and-fees-trend.png">by raising tuition.</a></p>

<p>He&#39;s the plan: Make a series of inflamatory speeches at public universities that is designed to stir up emotions. Conspire with the senior faculty and board members at said university to make a &quot;counter movement&quot;  that will clash with attendees of said &quot;free speech&quot; . Use the resulting exhorborant &quot;security costs&quot; as an excuse to permanently raise tuition to these public universities, resulting in an increase of overall university funds to justify a raise in the university&#39;s board and faculty pay, while increasing the national student debt crisis which I have bets against in my evil billionare portfolio making me a hefty sum.</p>

<p>I guess when you can&#39;t attack the argument attacking the person is an option.  However it does show those who actually think for themselves that you can&#39;t be trusted to provide correct unbiased information.</p>

<p>BTW, Why is he the anti-Christ and not the GOP billionaires trying to pollute, jail gays, and take rights away from everyone who isn&#39;t them? </p>

<p>What about the fact that Soros also said “taking America down would be the culmination of his life’s achievements”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s peel back a few layers on this. First, the only project that Soros would need $18 billion for is a color revolution in the United States. For comparison, Ukraine only cost Open Society about $5 billion.</p>

<p>Also notice the recent escalation in Antifa tactics, including Crowder&#39;s video showing them starting to carry guns and knives.</p>

<p>Second, if he had decided to go forward with a color revolution, he wouldn&#39;t tip his hand like this. It would be as quiet as possible.</p>

<p>So the only logical alternative I can think of is that Soros is threatening Trump with a color revolution if he doesn&#39;t start doing what Soros wants. </p>

There are families that are worth hundreds of billions of dollars out there, maybe a trillion or more for a few.

They&#39;re all going down in flames and he&#39;s smart enough to at the very least take that 18 B and put it in his charity fund account. He&#39;s either A. Going to off himself in the event he is exposed for a myriad of crimes, B. going to run, or C. he&#39;s actually being a good person and know&#39;s he will be arrested and all the money seized so he legit put it in a charity firm. Regardless, it is a  FACT that he just transferred 18 Billion, no matter what happens, he did that for a reason. Tick Tock....</p>
