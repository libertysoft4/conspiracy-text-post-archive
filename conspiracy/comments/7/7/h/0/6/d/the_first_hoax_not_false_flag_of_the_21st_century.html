        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Given the obvious hoaxes we have been subject to the last 2 decades I thought it would be interesting to see if they did the same thing on 9/11.  It would be so much easier to get people to stay silent if no one really died.  There were rumors the towers were empty before 9/11 after the basement bombing.  What they did to make it appears full was have the mall on the main level and restaraunt on the top of the building to make it appear like people were going in and out of the building.  The plane&#39;s did not really have people on board or were faked themselves.  This was evidenced by the fact the phone calls were faked.  One interesting piece of information that supports this is the pictures of the victims appeared to be photoshopped. I&#39;ll link that video in the comments.. Why would they fake ANY pictures of victims???? So what about the family and the witnesses that were all over explaining being in the towers?  You guessed it, they were crisis actors.  Even the ones  challenging the official  story like the maintenance man with the last name Rodriguez whose first name  I can&#39;t think of at the moment.  The reason why they would utilize an actor to challenge  their story is because he reinforced that people actually died.  This was important to steer the conspiracy people away from the truth. When it comes to the jumpers just look up the Israeli &quot;Art students&quot; whose job I&#39;m sure was to be able to fake jumpers.  In the footage they aired on TV you never saw people waving from windows.  That was all aired later and there are videos which say the measurements compared to the size of the people in the tower windows don&#39;t make sense.  Like they were on a scale model.  I&#39;m not claiming I have it all figured out but I want to hear what other people think.  I know I&#39;m going to get slammed in the comments but what else is new.  EDIT:  In Project Northwoods in which they attacks are based off the planes are empty and no one dies.   This is the picture video I was talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PoZEuj1VPv0">https://youtu.be/PoZEuj1VPv0</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked on Wall Street and I personally know many people who were in the buildings on 9/11. Some of them are dead and some escaped. For all my dead friends, if you are right then they still have not been seen since that day. This would mean that someone made them disappear. Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to kill them?</p>

<p>And for all the people I know who escaped, are they in on it? I had known some of them for over a decade. Were they just CIA plants that whole time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be so much easier for them to kill people rather than trust such a huge secret to many thousands of people. So, are you suggesting that the children of these people didn&#39;t lose a parent and are just faking it? Use logic and play it all the way out in your mind...the obvious and easiest answer is that those people did die. Murder is easier than trusting many thousands of people to keep quite and for their families and loved ones to never speak on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it is possible he was used to place thoughts in the mind of the public as to HOW things happened. Plant seeds. It wasn&#39;t claimed in either video he died...so, perhaps he was used to start early cover up. People died on 9/11. Including someone I knew. My uncle wouldn&#39;t have gone along with a plan that caused so much hurt to his wife and kids. No. Government planned and executed yes. Fake deaths...no.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could find hundreds of people who will. Maybe even a few thousand. But there is no way you will find hundreds of thousands of people who will lie. Those people have families and most of all kids. It means that every person who knows these people would have to lie too. It isnt feasible nor logical and way too dangerous. All it would take is one or two people to decide to speak and it is game over. Governments don&#39;t usually like to leave open ends. They tie that shit up. Much easier to kill people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I didn&#39;t watch the video. I don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m not being open minded. I believe 9/11 is a huge coverup and we definitely don&#39;t know what really happened. </p>

<p>But I am also a local and I really do know that the buildings are gone and tons of my friends died. Are there fake photos? Maybe. Did people I know see people jump from the buildings? Yes. </p>

<p>I was out of the country when it happened, or I would be a first hand witness. I worked two blocks away in a building that was partially destroyed by the collapse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but the people jumping could be what the &quot;Gelatin B&quot; project was with the Israeli Art student.  I&#39;ve spent over 100 hours looking into 9/11 over the years.  It doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m right but I&#39;m not just throwing shit out there</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes sense, but I knew a lot of people at Cantor Fitzgerald. I almost took a job there. If I had been trapped in the building I probably would have jumped as well. That doesn&#39;t mean that they didn&#39;t have fake jumpers ready to toss out. </p>

<p>Interesting story. I know two guys who walked down 80 flights of stairs to escape. When they got the bottom the fire escape door was chained shut from the outside. They banged and screamed and a fireman heard them and busted it open. That is why they are alive. No idea why a firescape would be chained shut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I see it. But there are two types of posts listed there: one is posts that (for whatever reason) required Mod approval one posts that were removed. Your post is listed as one that was approved by the mods. So, no, it was not censored, and that&#39;s why it shows up in a search of r/conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked with a guy who was a registered nurse who was either Red Cross, coast guard or something else was flown out there to help (no cancer yet) and saw death. Even if there were no intended victims, the body count is still there. </p>

<p>With the concept of a staged event in mind, money is still scary. Whole damn building could have theoretically been paid off handsomely. </p>

<p>Before 911, recall the 2.3 trillion? I&#39;m crap at math, but you could create a thousand billionaires or a million millionaires with just 1 trillion. Corrections welcome. </p>

<p>Not saying the 2.3 was used to fund any hoaxed or realistic attack but holy shit. Even half a mill makes very convincing hush money to anyone relatively too big to suicide or disappear.</p>

<p>As far as needing to fake photos though, why not right? The bigwigs who own the media have their own political hand to play and narritive to push. I&#39;ve seen a few goofishly fake looking &quot;news&quot; coverage. It would make sense to dish out tons of fake clips and pics for the simple purpose of maximizing emotional reaction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m willing to believe that all the ones said to have died did. Were there some actors involved..prob so. But it wasn&#39;t a hoax. People died in those towers, planes, rescue missions and on the ground. That wasn&#39;t faked</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes sense, but I knew a lot of people at Cantor Fitzgerald. I almost took a job there. If I had been trapped in the building I probably would have jumped as well. That doesn&#39;t mean that they didn&#39;t have fake jumpers ready to toss out. </p>

<p>Interesting story. I know two guys who walked down 80 flights of stairs to escape. When they got the bottom the fire escape door was chained shut from the outside. They banged and screamed and a fireman heard them and busted it open. That is why they are alive. No idea why a firescape would be chained shut.</p>
