        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Well look at that. Trump plutocracy fighting the rest of the plutocratic families. Obama and Bush suddenly coming out and shouting Trump down. Looks like Trump broke the Oligarchy code. Never prosecute the past actions of another president.  These past sitting presidents must have a lot to hide, OVER THE LAST 16 YEARS. They seem very worried, so much so, they are back in the public eye. </p>

<p>Our suspicions about Trump being part of the deep state has cooled down for now. If he does get to prosecute Hillary and land her in jail, my spidey senses tells me he is the real deal. If he is, he can roger me raw until red in the butt. No qualms. I&#39;ll take one for the team.</p>

<p>But a long waaaaay to go. I feel a JFK moment coming up. Pray it will never be like that.</p>

<p>I know this might come as a shock, but multiple events can happen in a similar time frame and not be connected to each other. The entire world isn&#39;t limited to what seems to be a few people&#39;s very narrow and limited attention spans. </p>

<p>‘Sarah, if the American people ever find out what we have done, they would chase us down the street and lynch us.’ - George Herbert Walker Bush</p>
</blockquote>

<p>pby1000 is correct.  In judicial appointments alone he has done more than these other two frauds in 9 months.  He may get more appointments than anyone since 1950 if congress can get off their collective asses.  </p>

<p>Additionally, that executive order to stop subsidy payments to insurance companies was a stroke of brilliance, forcing Congress to act.  </p>

<p>The fight he picked with the NFL was smart.  I didn&#39;t think so at the time, but Trump seems to really understand the American Public, their affinities and the point at which American&#39;s deem something unacceptable.  </p>

<p>He fast tracked the Dakota and Keystone Pipelines.  Some people may disagree that this is an accomplishment, but they are doing it on their plastic keyboards at their plastic computers, both rely on oil.  <a href="http://www.ranken-energy.com/Products%20from%20Petroleum.htm">http://www.ranken-energy.com/Products%20from%20Petroleum.htm</a></p>

<p>Iran deal decertification.  A large amount of what Trump has done doesn&#39;t seem to add up to much but yields the explicitly stated conclusion.  I am not a Trump-humper, but the dude is inelegantly stumbling toward a Reaganesque presidential legacy in terms of results.  </p>

<p>2 for 1 executive order on regulations is huge.  He stated that &#39;for every new regulations enacted, 2 must first be removed.  This is, imho, the single-most important factor when considering the unemployment rate is down to 4.4%, the inflation rate is very low, around 1.9%, the Dow and S&amp;P are setting record highs every day, and American manufacturing production is at a 30 year high.    </p>

<p>Oh yeah, Raqqa, the capital city of ISIS has been liberated.  Perhaps you didn&#39;t hear about it because Trump didn&#39;t do it himself like when Obama killed Osama Bin Laden with that flair-for-drama knife throw, like Schwartzenegger in Commando, but more limp-wristed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wX3neAjklc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wX3neAjklc</a>.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t want to, but I did vote for Trump because there was no other choice.  As it turns out, I was completely wrong but still right - Trump has been a great president so far and I don&#39;t think any of the other R candidates could have weathered the storm as well as he has.  So, as it turns out, there really was no other choice.  </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter when we were the ones funding ISIS the whole time. Though maybe their defeat means Trump recently stopped funding them as much as he could. I&#39;m still a little pissed at him for letting the Kurds hang but I don&#39;t really care that much so whatever.</p>

<p>I&#39;d agree with you on every other point though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NFL was going to continue to let the players destroy America&#39;s favorite game.  Ratings are down, attendance is down, merchandise sales are tanking.  Even the Saints, my beloved Saints, managed to ostracize me during this ordeal.  Trump made comments, knowing Americans were pissed about this thing, knowing the owners were gripping hard about this thing, and made Roger Goodell look like the asshole he is.  Next thing you know, owners were emboldened to take charge and make needed changes.  </p>

<p>The pipeline fight, if it is what you say it is, definitely had everything to do with &quot;us&quot;.  If it is as you say, then you are OK with an administrations insider-trading to a vulture-capitalist, quasi-capitalist, neo-liberal, robber-barron on the export of oil for the American people than you are an administration using it as a foreign policy ace?</p>

<p>Iran is a threat to everybody.  They subjugate liberty and fund terrorism.  No theocracy, let alone a fundamentalist, dictatorial theocracy, should have access to a nuclear device.  </p>

<p>&quot;We&quot; were not funding ISIS, the deep state was, including John McCain.  That (those) bastard(s) does (do) not do my bidding.  </p>

<p>Why would you be pissed about the Kurds, they are one of the few reasonable factions in the middle-east, and the only one with balls.</p>

<p>Thanks for the points on which you agree, It&#39;s been good to talk with you.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There was no &quot;deal&quot; with Iran.  Obama acted unilaterally.  It didn&#39;t go through Congress.  He gave Iran $1.7 billion and we got nothing.  </p>

<p>No one wanted Obamacare.  The Republicans didn&#39;t want it and not a single one of them voted for it.  The Democrat voters wanted, and still want, single payer.  It was also rammed through with a filibuster proof majority in the Senate and control of the House.  He could have passed anything, but he gave us Obamacare.</p>

<p>He also didn&#39;t end any wars.  We left Iraq because Bush and the Iraqi government had already agreed to the timeline.  Obama couldn&#39;t have stayed even if he wanted to.  Then ISIS took over half of Iraq and 2/3 of Syria.</p>

<p>Think of it this way.  If dubya nominates 334 judges who betray the American people and Trump nominates one judge who is loyal to the American people, then hasn&#39;t Trump done more?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the main point was trump did more which he didn’t. And your point is a GAINT if about some pedophiles with nothing backing that up except an of statement. And who is to say Trumps judges aren’t globalist either I mean Trump himself makes money around the globe using the same practices that all the globalist use. Globalism allowed him to make shitty hats in China and sell them at an extreme high markup in America same with Ivankas clothes line. The whole time bemoaning how the manufacturing should be brought back.  So no Trump hasn’t done more and your rebuttal to that statement was a joke. I just listed 100+ thing Bush did and you went to but everybody who was nominated before trump is a pedo. Guess what trump is in the same class as all those people you cry foul about. President Donald Trump&#39;s secretary of labor, Alexander Acosta,while he was the top federal prosecutor he cut a sweetheart plea deal in 2008 with a billionaire investor accused of having sex with dozens of underage girls. And Trump is quoted saying  I’ve known him fifteen years terrific guy. So yea rethink your position on trump, if your so concerned about pedos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem I see in this sub, is people using certain key words to actually avoid discussion, shut it down with zero effort. Projecting. Shill. Bait. Straw man. False equivalency. Etc. No one elaborates and proves their points, and half the time they use it wrong anyways.</p>

<p>&quot;Take ideas and arguments and destroy them this way&quot; by what, simply making an argument that something isn&#39;t true? Nothing is destroyed unless someone admits they&#39;re wrong, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with <em>being wrong</em>. It&#39;s called a discussion, the focus shouldn&#39;t be about being right or wrong.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about Bush being a shill or anything to do with the CIA, I mentioned his lack of relevance until he does something relevant.</p>

<p>&quot;The truth is simply the truth.&quot; Okay. And I guess you have the absolute truth, that&#39;s why you didn&#39;t respond to anything I said, but instead accused me of being the alt for some random comment you replied to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my defense, google has the virologist pinned as the author of this book as well. It&#39;s an easy mistake seeing as Google had the information presented incorrectly, which I had to catch as a result of due diligence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an appeal to authority, it&#39;s a recognition of the character behind a person and what motivates them/what kind of actions seem plausible or not. An academic is unlikely to fabricate information completely. That&#39;s not an appeal to their authority, it&#39;s a consequence of academic standards for writing. Now you&#39;re just being unnecessarily aggressive on this matter.</p>

<p>His father was a Nazi sympathizer, financial collaborator and supporter throughout the war but was never personally charged for that involvement.

    <div class="md"><p>You have a president with decades of working directly for/with powerful politicians (that he&#39;s now somehow going to lock up according to posts like these) and mainstream media networks. Attitude and reality are two separate things, so I&#39;m judging my post on the reality of the situation. If we lock up Obama and Clinton you think they&#39;re just going to ignore all the other illegal shit that goes on in politics? You think they&#39;re going to after Bush and Cheney? CIA/FBI/3 letter agencies? They&#39;re not. It would bring them down to our level, the government have to admit to too many crimes. Trump is a puppet like the rest, they wouldn&#39;t let him in if he wasn&#39;t. This is theater.</p>

<p>This feels more like separate factions of TPTB are in outright war for control.  The &#39;new&#39; faction is in power and trying to trash the outgoing faction, hence all this dirt hitting the streets right now and the old guard trying to make the dirt go away.  It seems the MSM is tied to the old guard as none of the uranium news is being covered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly nobody cared until Trump acted like he was a victim because people say Happy Holidays. Thats a decision for the military to make. They&#39;ve decided having trans troops is perfectly fine. Plus the president has bigger things to do than call out Nfl players for non violent protests. I know you&#39;ll swallow any bullshit Trump puts out because you agree with him l. There&#39;s a reason he keeps pushing the button on these wedge issues and it&#39;s because hes sitting at around 35% approval rating. If he keeps bringing up issues that are divided 50/50 all he has to do is pick whatever side he wants and 50% of the people will side with him</p>

<p>35% number is from MSM polls. If you still believe that shit then you need to think more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you want something I personally found that would be nothing. However if you want me to parrot what George Webb has discovered in his own investigation, and the investigation that Judicial Watch is conducting I couldn&#39;t possible do it. There is too much information to delve into in a single comment. Or a single post.  George Webb has been at the helm of his investigation for a year. If you really want truth dig in friend. If you want to remain ignorant then by all means do so it is your prerogative.  I&#39;d be happy to provide links for which you can discover the information yourself. Me sharing the information won&#39;t help you decide for yourself what is going on. Of course if you are just asking for my opinion on the matter I&#39;d be more than welcome to give that.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>You literally said in your last comment if you could point me to more information. Why the hell is everyone being so vague? I asked a question and I get shadow answers. I&#39;m not asking you to wipe my nose and be my teacher but when I type in &quot;George Webb&quot; to try and figure out what this shit show is I get this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>George Webb Corporation is an American chain of 31 lunch counter-style restaurants in the state of Wisconsin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I don&#39;t know what the fuck everyone is talking about. Maybe I need to go post this over at <a href="/r/eli5">/r/eli5</a> or <a href="/r/OutOfTheLoop">/r/OutOfTheLoop</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to remain ignorant then by all means do so it is your prerogative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would think it is pretty clear I don&#39;t since I&#39;m asking questions about it. I imagine other people reading this post feel the same way.</p>

<p>Final thought...</p>

<p>The thing about posts like this is people sometimes just assume everyone already knows the complete backstory and if they don&#39;t they are lazy or can&#39;t google. The fact is how can anyone know everything about anything and still functionally operate? People miss shit. </p>

<p>One solution would be to step back and take a moment to think about the post you are about to make and ask yourself what are some of the questions people might ask about this. If you can get even 20% of those knocked out you are on your way. Making vague references and playing keyword bingo don&#39;t really work.</p>

<p>you can start here. I can&#39;t provide concrete evidence because I haven&#39;t informed myself fully. I merely suggested you look into it yourself because only you or the the person deciding to look will be able to take off their biases glasses and look. This scandal cuts past the party lines. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to thank you for discussing this and presenting your point of view. I do understand that it might seem as if I was trying to make the case that some one is lazy since they don&#39;t know about it. But I&#39;m not the only reason I kept suggesting to review the information yourself is so you can formulate an opinion not skewed by my own biases.</p>

<p>Methinks the abuse isn&#39;t as bad as it&#39;s being emotionally put out there. Yeah some real rapes occurred with underage teens but some women and men really did use the casting couch for themselves. </p>
