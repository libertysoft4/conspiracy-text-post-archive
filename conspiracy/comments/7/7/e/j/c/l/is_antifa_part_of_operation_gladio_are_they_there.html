    <div class="md"><p>antifa have existed for decades and they are nothing like isis. the reason you hear more about them now is because of the rise in right wing extremism. whilst they are throwing bottles of urine and smashing windows, right wing extremists are killing people by running them over with cars so the right wing media will be pushing the antifa narrative to make them sound like a legitimate threat. obviously its working.</p>

<p>When was the last time the KKK lynched someone?</p>

<p>When was the last time AntiFa caused violence and property damage?</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>In the meantime, antifa are were plotting gas attacks on Trump supporters because of &quot;muh feels&quot;</p>

<p>I can see why you hate them like I hate AntiFa, but the KKK doesn&#39;t go around causing riots, property damage, and attacking innocent people.</p>

<p>well, they do and hate speech incites those actions. but it is different to antifas actions. i wont look at your links until after the football later, but ive never denied theyre violent, and ive said i dont agree with their actions. </p>

<p>to me, the videos ive seen of antifa attacking people, they look like scared kids who cant fight for shit and gang up on people. </p>

<p>i gave you 5 or 6 examples of hate speech resulting in murder. all within the last few years, including this year. you have not responded to that at all.</p>

<p>do you even disagree with their basic idea that racism is wrong? disagreeing with their actions, their methods is one thing. i think theyre idiotic kids in that regard, but i dont believe theres a place for racism in a free and civilized society. are you saying youre ok with right wing extremists murdering people because they are black?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, just so you know... butyric acid is more commonly known as a &quot;stink bomb&quot;. so no, they werent planning a &quot;&quot;gas attack&quot;, they were planning to let off a stink bomb. </p>

<p>that, along with your lack of awareness about people literally getting murdered because of hate speech, just reinforces my view that theres a lot of false right wing propaganda surrounding antifa and a lot of people are falling for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well.</p>

<p>No. Not really. The first degree I was permanent (obviously, most people do their first degree full-time), but now I do it part-time. A few hours per week while I work, hence why they have taken substantially longer.</p>

The whole plan is to cause enough conflict it leads to a shooting war, and when the first shots are fired they come for everyone&#39;s gun, and when we can&#39;t defend ourselves from the jackboots, it&#39;s over, like 1984 except full of pajama boys and gender confused children. Big things planned for November 4th.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, you&#39;re totally delusional.  You should stop eating up so much ANTIFA lit.  They are clearly a group, and they have been since 1932 when they were founded as the militant wing of the Communist Party (and claimed as such in Rote Fahne, their newspaper).</p>

<p>You&#39;re little just some edgy dupe.  Which year did you drop out of college?  Just curious.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not American so didn&#39;t go to &#39;college&#39; and if you mean &#39;what year did you drop out of University?&#39;. The answer is &#39;I have not, and have been studying almost constantly since 2004 around the other work I do&#39;. Currently hold two degrees. One in British Law, one in Swedish Law, and working towards a Masters in Swedish Law.</p>

<p>I fail to see how that is relevant. </p>

<p>and attacking innocent people</p>

<p>well, they do and hate speech incites those actions. but it is different to antifas actions. i wont look at your links until after the football later, but ive never denied theyre violent, and ive said i dont agree with their actions. </p>

<p>to me, the videos ive seen of antifa attacking people, they look like scared kids who cant fight for shit and gang up on people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very ironic,yes. They silence through violence. Opposing views are to be crushed. By definition they are, themselves, fascists. Interestingly, the new definition of fascism calls it a right-wing ideology. This is revisionism in its finest.</p>

<p>&quot;Nazi is an acronym for National SOCIALIST German Worker&#39;s Party. (In German) Obviously a self-declared socialist worker&#39;s party is very clearly left-wing.&quot;</p>
