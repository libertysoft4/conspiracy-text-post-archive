<p><strong><a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/cr59d5a445.PNG">diagram</a></strong></p>

<p>The inner door (the one closest to the actual stairs) was braced shut from the hallway side of the door.  The outer door (that opens directly into the hallway) wasn&#39;t braced shut.  The theory is that Paddock had the outer door propped open while he put the brace on the inner door.</p>

<p>But, as others have pointed out, Campos said he was actually going to check on an open door alarm for one of the guest rooms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I was also confused thinking I swear they said smoke alarm.</p>

<p>But they also stated in the beginning that it was a door alarm from a suite  few rooms away at first which made no sense.</p>

<p>Friday October 6th:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An open door a few rooms away from the Las Vegas suite of the man who was gunning down concertgoers at a music festival set off an alarm that prompted a response from a security guard, Clark County Undersheriff Kevin C. McMahill said Friday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There would be a sensor on a stairwell door. There is a reason why they are heavy and have that closing assist damper on them. They would be part of a system that controls air flow to the common corridors keeps all stairwells at a higher air pressure. There would be a physical annunciator panel for the fire dept to read but the main security desk would have all the sensors in the system on a computer graphic interface. The room doors would probably be on the security and card key system. Most likely independent of the fire and smoke detection system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good info, and that makes sense that both the fire dept. and secuity would have access to those sensors, but they have reported that Campos was responding to a sensor tripped by a guest doorway, not the fire exit so I&#39;m still wondering what type of sensor they have for guest rooms. Most hotels log card swipe data on the lock itself, they usually are not networked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They would see an open door on their display so alarm kind of means silent unless it is the kind that is right on the door like a fire door on a secure floor.
Security makes hourly rounds 24/7 of all fire doors to physically ensure their operation and status. Campos might have been doing this but I wouldn&#39;t have expected him to be so fat.lol. Usually the security guy carries a device that reads a bar code which documents his rounds with timestamps. Maybe a little different now .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that was the case, It seems like they would have gone with the simplest narrative: &quot;He was on a routine patrol, found a barricaded fire door and proceeded to investigate.&quot; I still think it&#39;s worth it to find out whether or not the guest doors are networked because:</p>

<p>A. It&#39;s a hole in the story that they can&#39;t retroactively cover up.</p>

<p>B. It would be relatively easy info to get. </p>

<p>C. It might imply that other means were used to dispatch Campos to that location that Mandalay Bay doesn&#39;t want to reveal to the public, some other form of guest monitoring ... maybe in the shooter&#39;s room? Shooting is an incredibly common tourist attraction in Vegas, security is probably used to seeing weapons in rooms, but maybe they keep tabs on those people and when Paddock started to act more suspicious than the average gun owner, they went to check it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their is some sophisticate stuff installed. While most homes have infrared sensors some buildings would use three different sensors-- motion, temperature and sound. And this was years ago so as far as security systems go I am probably behind in my knowledge. Fire systems are probably of the same tech as when I worked with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that Mandalay Bay would have a very advanced state of security system. It would not surprise me if they did not sense a pressure drop in &#39;Paddock&#39;s room when he or the shooters broke out the windows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is very possible, I remember hearing that they sometimes screw with the air pressure and oxygen  levels in casinos to keep people gambling, so it would make sense that the system would be very sophisticated and controllable. Maybe the casino wanted to conceal that info because it&#39;s kind of a dirty trick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best info I&#39;ve seen (sorry, no sources at hand) say it wasn&#39;t an &quot;alarm&quot; per the common definition. The claim was that the hotel uses a system called HotSOS that does, in fact, have a door monitor (not &quot;alarm&quot;) on every room. The system is meant to help them manage such a large number of rooms by coordinating room service for when you&#39;re actually out of the room.</p>

<p>One feature of the system, beyond monitoring when you&#39;ve left, is that it will alert the front desk if a door is ajar for more than a few minutes. It can send alerts through text message or voice, email etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we should look into is how Paddock hear the door close after he was shooting an automatic firearm inside?  He wouldn&#39;t hear shit either 1) His ears would be ringing or 2) He&#39;s wearing ear protection and still can&#39;t hear shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good info, and that makes sense that both the fire dept. and secuity would have access to those sensors, but they have reported that Campos was responding to a sensor tripped by a guest doorway, not the fire exit so I&#39;m still wondering what type of sensor they have for guest rooms. Most hotels log card swipe data on the lock itself, they usually are not networked.</p>
