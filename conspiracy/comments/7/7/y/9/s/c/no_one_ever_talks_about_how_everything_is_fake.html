    <div class="md"><p>How we live today is an extension of how we have lived for the last 10,000 years since we invented farming. There was no going back once humans decided to settle down and cultivate grain, and this gave rise to, as you said, philosophy, law, religion, politics, and money. </p>

<p>To be awake is, to me, to be aware of these things, to be aware of the evil which controls our society, and to seek to make it better. We can not work outside of this framework because this framework <em>is</em>. It is civilization, it is how we got the the point where you and I can talk because of magic numbers transferred through electricity across vast distances. We must live for each other, and constantly try to improve, but there is no going back. Philosophy, law, religion, politics, money, these are a part of who we are. The only thing I can see going away in the future is money, if we discover technology to allow for post-scarcity economics. But as far as I am concerned the rest are, and will continue to be, a fundamental part of civilization. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taxes are a Social Contract that we abide by and expect societal returns on. Politics is crooked but can be straight, if the People demand accountability and higher standards, and follow these demands with their votes. Religion may be an illusion but as I said it has existed since before civilization and even if you believe it is used today only as a method of control, it came from our distant ancestors honest beliefs in these forces.

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to hear. I&#39;ve just been there before in the beginning and middle parts of my journey where I thought everything was a lie or was fake and for the most part it has been a lie but not fake.</p>

<p>A lie is different than being fake. A lie needs some semblance of truth in order for it to be convincing. This is where gatekeepers and controlled oppositions come into the picture. A bit of truth mix with unhealthy lies. Just enough to gain your confidence and trust. But in the end, the goal is to control and keep you.</p>

<p>The elites want you in a constant state of confusion. Where you have no idea what is real or fake. You cannot trust your gut or senses. They want this but, it&#39;s not real. Always trust your gut and senses but, do not be afraid to get a second opinion from someone you respect, love, and trust. Humans are social and we need to bounce ideas and thoughts off one another. No matter how different our thoughts will be. Middle ground is usually always found.</p>

<p>Hope that helps a little bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, not all of it is fake. Law and Philosophy are real, but they can break down in practice if the citizen body becomes apathetic. Religion is a touchy subject, but regardless on whether or not it is real, it has been a part of the human experience since before civilization began. Money is fake in the sense that it is only determined by what humans deem have value- we could choose that granite has more value than gold at any time, but we choose gold because of its scarcity. Politics are fake so far as the People allow elections to be considered legitimate that are clearly not so. Politics possesses the capacity to be real, however, and not all political history is fake.</p>

<p>I agree that they are abstract things, but human will and consciousness allows them to become <em>real</em>. A rock may not know it is within one country or another, but human beings, as conscious actors, <em>do</em>, and as such make it just as real as if it were an outgrowth of nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but these things are in a special class of real because they subjective. We don&#39;t all see the same abstract things in the world, which often leads to war over things like borders.</p>

<p>But these things are presented as real to people growing up. It is worth stopping and considering what parts of your reality were invented by people other than you, because these are the things that can change.</p>

<p>Agreed, but this is part of the human condition. We must work towards a future in which we can reach a universally recognized state of affairs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is worth stopping and considering what parts of your reality were invented by people other than you, because these are the things that can change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I completely agree. As I have said in other comments on this thread, I recognize that everything stated by OP: Philosophy, law, Religion, Politics, and Money, were created by our distant ancestors. But these same forces come hand in hand with civilization as we know it. They are natural outgrowths of response towards organization and the capacity for the expansion of human societies. They can change, but they will fundamentally remain, perhaps with the exception of money, due to technological advancement. But Philosophy, Law, and Politics, will never go away, unless human civilization does. Nor will religion, it will simply change forms. We may go from believing in gods to believing in science, but we will still hold primacy of faith in one institution or another. These things are part and parcel of the package we call civilization. </p>

<p>-Said Apollo, along side every other indoctrinated left brained individual -</p>

<p>Being spiritually bankrupt is not something to take pride in. </p>

<p>There is nothing new under the sun. </p>

<p>We cannot blame the individuals for the spirit they possess though, as they have been fooled to wordsmith someone else&#39;s agenda.</p>

<p>The Ego is a powerfully prideful tool. I&#39;ve noticed it is strongest in the people at the top of all of these professions: musicians, actors, physicians, scientists, and college tenured professors. </p>

<p>The &quot;white lab coats&quot; as I call our doctors and scientists, no longer hold that unquestioned controlling influence on me that it once held over my families in past generations. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that everything is a lie, it&#39;s more complicated than that. The truth is twisted and everything is upside down or dualistic; thanks to the Masonic control we are under. </p>

<p>Who heads this control? The Pope (knights of Malta jesuits), the Queen, and her son Prince Charles (top dog of masonry) the Rothschild&#39;s (who financed both sides of Napoleon&#39;s War and control the FED) the Sackler&#39;s (who control all OxyContin production in the US) I could continue on and on.. </p>

<p>You may not believe in religion, but you better believe the people at the top do. (When I say religion, I speak in terms of spiritual principalities, not organized 4-wall building religion,) </p>

<p>These people at the top take oaths, make Faustian Pacts, and worship 40 ft. Owls of Pagan Gods in secret wooded forests to get where they&#39;re at. These poor musicians sacrifice relatives and friends for materialistic gain (see snoop dog, Kanye, jayz)</p>

<p>Doctors treat symptoms instead of  the root cause, because they must follow the rules of pharmaceutical companies in order not to lose their license and there&#39;s no money in it to heal.</p>

<p>Scientists hide the truth in the basements of museums and the secret brotherhoods of masons and jesuits.</p>

<p>Take Charles Darwin (a 33 degree mason)  flip and reverse = Nimrad, or Nimrod. No monkey ever developed consciousness by nature selection. </p>

<p>Take the swastika, and ancient symbol of good fortune. It&#39;s true meaning flipped and reversed from the Little Dipper&#39;s rotation around the North Star to the symbol of hatred.</p>

<p>Take the Catholic Church, who have allowed pedos and  their leader to take the place of worship that Christ assigned to the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p>Take every elementary school classroom that has a globe in it. If one realizes that this is not the nature of the world, then they would no longer believe they&#39;re insignificant specs of dust in a vast unproven universe. </p>

<p>Pythagoras, Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton were all from the same brotherhood. </p>

<p>You say religion is fake, but the sheer utterance of Jesus (Yeshua&#39;s) name now days brings up a form of blacklisting and gaslighting in society that is not found when speaking of pagan deities. Before you make statements of validation, ask  yourself why go through all this trouble to hide truth when Christ hide nothing? </p>

<p>&quot;True wisdom is knowing that you know nothing&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s crazy that we spend so much time fighting on Earth when the truth is in the sky.not god but space.there is so much more then just this Earth,we should be focused and spending the money that is spent on wars on space travel and work together to find the truth instead of bickering about racism and such.the human race will end if it doesn&#39;t work together.space exploration should be humanities main focus not our petty beliefs </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;ll find in history most art has been created to convey a message, to express their feelings, to capture a moment, or for a multitude of personal reasons which you can&#39;t really generalise to all creators of all art, especially considering the huge range of differences between the types of arts and techniques and an impossible list of so ons. While yes, I agree to some extent nothing is just made for the sake of creation, I really don&#39;t see how you then arrive at art is made strictly for fame, big or small? </p>
