        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At first, I was extremely confused about the new update mostly because I didn&#39;t know/understand the details of the actual collusion, so I&#39;m making this post to help those that are still stuck.</p>

<p>Clinton and Obama had struck a deal with Russian officials in 2010 which would sell 20% of US uranium. They sold this uranium to a Canadian company called Uranium One which would act as a proxy to cover their tracks while hundreds of millions of Russian dollars were being transferred into the Clinton Foundation (another proxy). One year prior to the finalization of the deal, the FBI had gained knowledge of a potential bribery scheme by Russia to give large sums of money to the Clinton Foundation in return for a massive amount of uranium, however, the FBI did not interfere.</p>

<p>TL;DR Hannity explained it perfectly, &quot;Clinton and her husband sold out America to the Russians as [money] flowed to the Clinton Foundation.&quot;</p>

<p>If I made a mistake or left something out, let me know in the comments and I will update my post!</p>

<p>Edit: I guess I didn&#39;t make this clear enough, but Hannity is NOT the source of the information I provided. I referenced him in a quote that I thought was a good tl;dr of the post.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Most of my counterarguments to the comments arguing against my post are rather long so I&#39;m very sorry to those who have/are willing to read through them (unless you enjoy it lol).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What confuses me about all of this is that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Uranium One has mining stakes accounting for 1/5 of US production.</li>
<li>The Uranium is still in the US.</li>
<li>95% of the donations were from one person well before Clinton was SOS.</li>
<li>Even as SOS, the committee of 9 had to approve the sale.</li>
<li>The nuclear regulatory committee had to sign off on it.</li>
<li>All that was transferred was the mining rights that Uranium One owned.</li>
<li>No one could have stopped the sale of a Canadian company anyway. They may have stopped the transfer of mining rights but there had to be clear evidence that it posed a threat.</li>
</ol>

<p>None of this is really news-worthy because it&#39;s all loosely connected and there has been zero impact. It wasn&#39;t like we just packed up and shipped Uranium to Russia, they still have to mine it.</p>

<p>Good to know.</p>

<p>Julian Assange is a compromised journalist. Of course he would say what we needs to to sow dissent. He&#39;s working for the Russians, why would be blame them?</p>

<p>But are you going to acknowledge the other points or is that still not enough proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol this has nothing to do with common sense. For one who believes in common sense over research, a remark that states that Assange is working for the Russians would be typical. You&#39;re probably unaware of this (because common sense &gt; doing research), but Wikileaks has over a decade, that&#39;s ten years, of consistent 100% accuracy regarding its posts. Here&#39;s a great example: prior to 1822, it was common sense to believe in geocentrism. The research that proved otherwise (heliocentrism) was there, but no one wanted to believe it because it challenged the norm.
And here we go again with people accusing a quote that summarizes the situation as a source. He is not the source of my information, he just so happened to summarize my post rather well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except for last 4 years of wikileaks life, it&#39;s been in geopolitical limbo, with Assange in hiding. In that time period, they&#39;ve never released anything contrary to the Kremlin&#39;s wishes, acting as a consequence-free tool to destabilize the west. But that must be something you missed in your &quot;research&quot; right? For someone who sure loves doing your own &quot;research&quot; you&#39;ve certainly proved in a short time you&#39;re incapable. Let me know what Alex Jones thinks of this.</p>

Hillary Clinton&#39;s close friend and prominent figure in Clinton&#39;s political life, Huma Abedin, has deep ties with an organization called the Muslim Brotherhood.

<p>Also you&#39;ve done nothing to disprove Wikileaks&#39; accuracy. &quot;They&#39;ve never released anything contrary to the Kremlin&#39;s wishes.&quot; Lol, you do know that Assange has come out stating that within the past 3 weeks Wikileaks has released several documents against Russia.</p>

<p>Compared to the level of interference wikileaks created in the US election, a sparse new &quot;leak&quot; of that nature is literally worthless.</p>

<p>Why is it my job to prove wikileaks isn&#39;t biased? Isn&#39;t it yours, mr Research? Or is the bullshit finally piling up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I never thought someone&#39;s sheer lack of knowledge would make me laugh, but as you just demonstrated, never say never.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting that Wikileaks is anti-Russia. All I&#39;m stating is that Wikileaks does not favor any specific nation, all they want to do is shine a light on the corruption that plagues these nations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not disagreeing with you that Wikileaks caused an interference during the time of the US election, and plausibly the election itself. If the Podesta leaks caused Trump to win, then that just goes to show how many Americans stopped putting up with Clinton&#39;s shady activity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s your job to prove Wikileaks <em>is</em> biased. I gave you what I found to be a valid reason why Wikileaks is unbiased, now show me your valid reason why they are (psst, that&#39;s how arguments work).</p>

<p>I have not downvoted a single comment within my post, in fact I&#39;ve actually stated that I don&#39;t want people to downvote comments (go look for yourself).</p>

<p>Lol I&#39;m a Russian bot because I allegedly deflect everything to Hillary. 10/10 great argument.</p>

<p>My research skills may be a joke to you, but unlike you, I did research. You&#39;ve provided nothing but insults which do nothing to support your arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not really that difficult to believe. I mean if you&#39;re at his knees and revere him as a god as many users here (which is contrary to the general rules of true conspiracy theorists... because he is an establishment) I can see why. Pretty much every release he&#39;s made has been a pointed attack on western values and the US government. You have to start asking yourself &quot;Why?&quot; Wikileaks completely neglected to cover Crimea, which was one of the most successful covert land grabs of this decade, because it was made by Russia.</p>

<p>Regardless, because you and other users here idealised him, you refuse to ask questions. Which, in the context of this Sub, is also hilarious to me. How ironic a sub about not being a shill can become one so easily because... what? He cucked your government?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an abundance of evidence telling us that the Trump/Russia collusion is fabricated. EVERYONE have been up his ass for two years, and nothing. Did you miss when congress recently came out and admitted they had found no evidence of trump Russia collusion, or evidence of russian influencing the votes. And they really did not want to do that.</p>

<p>Do you believe the wikileaks are legit? 
FYI, liberals loved him during the Bush/Iraq thing.
Because I could link you a email chain where they(Hillary/dnc) discuss this Russian collusion as a last resort. Wikileaks have 100% proven trackrecord, many have gone to courts to prove them wrong, and have lost every time. Julian have even questioned why congress nor any other government body have come to him and asked him what is true. This was before Julian Assange allegedly got abducted and half the internet stopped trusting him.</p>
