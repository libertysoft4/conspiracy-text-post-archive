    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not true. One of the most active chemtrail posters uses summit-cameras from Switzerland and Austria, so they&#39;re probably from the alpine region. It&#39;s a global phenomenon. Though I personally find the pictures to be very convincing, as water vapor from regular kerosine combustion can leave pretty dense and at least somewhat persistent trails under the right conditions.</p>

<p>What I do find convincing though is the amounts of aluminum and barium and strontium we keep finding everywhere, from soil to glaciers. Personally, I think those nano-metals are infused in the central supply lines jet fuel to big international airports whenever the sun gets predicted to become especially active. I&#39;m not convinced the purpose of &quot;chemtrails&quot; is directly malicious, but I do think it is causing many collateral issues like higher rates of Alzheimer&#39;s disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My perspective: This isn&#39;t just for the chemtrails subject, just look at all the JFK documents suddenly being spammed.... It&#39;s a distraction.</p>

<p>A distraction to keep people from searching for that which is NOT irrelevant. Yes, Chemtrails are a real thing, that shit&#39;s been around for ages and isn&#39;t even a conspiracy anymore (Geo-engineering)</p>

<p>What we should be focussing on is the 5G control grid that&#39;s being rolled out right under our feet. It concerns us all. The beginning of a totalitarian society. 24/7 monitoring and essentially a digital prison.</p>

<p>Contrails stay for 20 seconds under normal conditions. Under certain conditions, aka when it freezes they stay up to a few minutes.</p>

<p>Chemtrails aren&#39;t produced by air damp, they stay up to hours and fade out as if they&#39;re clouds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is an often-repeated myth. Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition">sublimation</a>), but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition">deposition</a>) and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. It&#39;s not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in a rural area there are no airports near me. Planes don&#39;t fly you. Every day for jets at 930 lay out a grid pattern in the sky. 
When I drive an hour away to the nearest airport none of the commercial airplanes leave a mark in the sky. 
you can rant about your contrails, contrails don&#39;t leave formations that look like tire tracks. Contrails dont coat the sky with an irridescent reflection that looks like an oil slick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a good reason you see them where you are, and not near the airport. Aircraft only start to create contrails when they climb over 23,000 feet, so if they take off from there they&#39;ll just about be reaching contrail altitude when they go over you. The last place you&#39;ll find contrails is near an airport, unless it is used as a waypoint for high altitude aircraft navigating from A to C via B (you).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nonsense, I bet you believe the swamp gas theory too. the chemtrails are laid out in a specific grid pattern. It is usually 4 jets working in tandem. I have observed these jets  even meet exactly in the same place to make lay out circular patterns. Commercial planes do not fly in a circle. Commercial planes do not make x marks in the middle of the sky. Commercials jets do not make tire marking clouds. These are biological weapons and there is a reason why they are not acknowledged by the government. Stop your naive assumptions. Your blind trust seems ridiculous. It might not be a problem where you live but it is a problem where many people live. An open mind is a sign of wisdom but the the ignorant fool is boastful. </p>

<p>Look up &#39;Holding pattern&#39;. Better still, load up Flightradar24 and click on any aircraft coming in to land at a major airport. Chances are it will have flown several circles in the holding stack.</p>

<p>Then look up &#39;Air corridor&#39; and &#39;Vertical separation&#39; and you&#39;ll learn that planes fly along invisible but well-defined highways which cross at different altitudes. From the ground that looks like an X, or even a crosshatch pattern. When one aircraft follows another it avoids flying right through the contrail ahead because of the turbulence and loss of visibility. So it flies alongside and bingo.... two contrails.</p>

<p>You talk about ignorant fools, but you are making wild statements apparently without the slightest understanding of what aircraft do up there.</p>

<p>I have considered all the claims made by chemtrailers with an open mind. The claims all fall to pieces as soon as you test them. All of them. Now, are you open minded enough to consider the logical, provable, scientific explanation for why airliners leave massive plumes  behind them. I will be happy to explain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have except that the fumes are switched off to purposely create the grids and artificial shapes. In addition these 4 planes do not follow the commercial flight schedules nor reflect heavy air traffic times. I don&#39;t need your explanation, commercial air trafic does not cross my area. You assume I am unfamiliar with commercial airline industry. These are not commercial jets. These jets have modified exhaust systems that can be turned on or off to create specific shapes. Like I said contrails don&#39;t look like tire treads, chem trails do. 
I have said nothing wild, I have given you anecdotal evidence that I personally witnessed over the past 6 months. It is so obvious that the residents here think it is pesticides being sprayed and they complain of health issues after a particularly intense day of chemtrails. Never assume that the official narrative is true, trust is reserved for family not the government and science is just as corrupt. Ask Monsanto or any pharma rep. </p>

<p>Those &#39;chemtrails&#39; are six miles up, and however many miles away. If they stay up there, that means they are not coming down in a hurry. So where do you think they will come down? I live in the English Midlands. There are at least six major corridors in sight. Some days there are too many trails to count (like, 50+) and they merge into a layer of haze. But the winds up there blow at 200 mph, generally eastwards, so I reckon anything up there is probably going to come down somewhere over Siberia. Yes, governments do spray people for nefarious reasons. It&#39;s been well documented. But they don&#39;t spray people from six miles altitude. They do that from low level planes, helicopters, trucks, and ships anchored offshore. </p>

In addition these 4 planes do not follow the commercial flight schedules nor reflect heavy air traffic times. I don&#39;t need your explanation, commercial air trafic does not cross my area. You assume I am unfamiliar with commercial airline industry. These are not commercial jets. These jets have modified exhaust systems that can be turned on or off to create specific shapes. Like I said contrails don&#39;t look like tire treads, chem trails do. 
I have said nothing wild, I have given you anecdotal evidence that I personally witnessed over the past 6 months. It is so obvious that the residents here think it is pesticides being sprayed and they complain of health issues after a particularly intense day of chemtrails. Never assume that the official narrative is true, trust is reserved for family not the government and science is just as corrupt. Ask Monsanto or any pharma rep. </p>
