        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>BACKGROUND;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve followed this story with special interest in how the attacks could be carried out. Some acoustics and/or weapons experts say it&#39;s possible an acoustic weapon is used, and some say you can&#39;t deliver a targeted signal strong enough to have the effects reported by the victims. We know that sonic weapons exist, but not how such weapons pick out one person sleeping in a hotel and deliver a signal so highly energized that it disrupts and damages the functions of the body without affecting anyone else around them.</p>

<p>Then I read this:</p>

<p><a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/3813109/us-tourist-cuba-sonic-attack/">American tourist says sonic attack may have hit him</a>.</p>

<p>From the get-go I&#39;ve noted that the reports of these attacks include the fact that the targets were in bed when they felt it/developed symptoms. I took my mind back to something I heard about avoiding sleeping on box springs. I can&#39;t find the original source, but remember clearly that the reasoning for avoiding box springs is the coiled metal springs act as a resonator. The source of the info mentioned it in the context of a larger subject about the bad effects of EM radiation such as from Wi-Fi and cell phones. It put the thought in my mind that the next time I get a new bed, I&#39;m avoiding box springs.</p>

<p>The article above has passages that lend credence to the theory that box springs are somehow at play. Excerpts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After spending his first day walking the city, he checked into room 1414 of the recently refurbished Hotel Capri. Within minutes of going to bed, he started losing feeling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Onset of symptoms when he gets into bed. That&#39;s interesting. Also note, the hotel was recently refurbed. Did they replace the beds and use box springs? Did they use something other than box springs prior to the refurb? If the answers are yes and yes, we have a clue. If no, my theory is proven false.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The tingling originated in his toes, like that prickly feeling when your foot falls asleep. It spread into his ankles and calves, then to his fingertips. He got up to investigate, and the sensation went away. He got back in bed. The tingling returned,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, detectives, more info that points toward the bed. It&#39;s either the source of the signal -- but that&#39;s unlikely for several reasons -- or something in the materials or design of the bed is amplifying a signal directed at the person lying on it. It&#39;s only a clue, but a strong one. The victim gets out of bed and the symptoms stop, gets back into bed and they return.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While the State Department says it’s not aware of any tourists being attacked, it has given credence to the notion that the unidentifiable danger could potentially ensnare any American who sets foot on the island. Its extraordinary warnings last month noted that assaults have occurred <em>at popular tourist hotels, including the Capri.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hotels are known for attracting business with comfy beds. Comfy bed use what? Box springs. My theory gets blown out of the water if we find out that the hotels did not use box springs; however, we know that the sweet spot between comfort and affordability is found by using box springs under the mattress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He stayed on the 14th floor of the same Havana hotel where U.S. government workers have been attacked, including on an upper floor. He described sudden-onset symptoms that began in his hotel bed, but disappeared in other parts of the room — similar to accounts given by U.S. government workers who described attacks narrowly confined to just parts of rooms. They also spoke of being hit at night, in bed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well damn, a pattern emerges. Other victims report the same pattern. In bed: symptoms. Out of bed: symptoms go away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whatever happened on his first night in Havana, it came back the next evening. Again the numbness set in within minutes of getting into bed, this time stronger and in more parts of his body. It didn’t go away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The effect is cumulative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Allen’s loss of sensation on both sides of the body ruled out peripheral nerve damage, suggesting the problem was in his central nervous system instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A clue that the sonic weapons targets the central nervous system.</p>

<p>ASK SCIENCE</p>

<p>I&#39;m no expert, but I can gather info. First, define a resonator:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A resonator is a device or system that exhibits resonance or resonant behavior, that is, it naturally oscillates at some frequencies, called its resonant frequencies, with greater amplitude than at others. The oscillations in a resonator can be either electromagnetic or mechanical. -Wiki</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally oscillates at some frequencies. Greater amplitude. Can be electromagnetic. To me, that looks like a trail of clues to follow. It helps us hypothesize how the weapon works.</p>

<p>NEXT STEP: LEARN MORE ABOUT RESONATORS</p>

<p>I found something interesting:</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Waves/cavity.html">Cavity Resonance</a>.</p>

<p>It says nothing about box springs as resonator, but instead, air cavities. &quot;Larger volume produces lower frequencies.&quot; That caught my eye because the acoustic experts say ELF is the likely culprit IF sonic attacks produced the symptoms/effects reported in Cuba.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Sound/reson.html#c1">More about the physics of resonance</a></p>

<p>I found that because it mentions springs and our focus is now on how box springs can amplify a signal using resonance.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Waves/cavity.html#c2">More about cavity resonance</a>. I don&#39;t know the physics of all this, but in reading this I keep thinking &quot;a box of coiled metal springs could be the perfect cavity for creating resonance.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonic-Bomb-Vibrating-Mattress-Springs/dp/B005TDUL2U">Wow, a $30 device that uses the box springs of a bed to shake it and wake you up</a>.</p>

<p>BOX SPRINGS, REALLY?</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m getting better results as I use better search terms. And yeah, I&#39;m finding advice to avoid box springs because of how they can amplify signals that disrupt functions in the body. Here&#39;s a quote to give background:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two of the more well-known biological impacts from electro-smog are the interruption of your brain wave patterns leading to behavior issues and the interference with your body&#39;s communication system (cytoskeleton) leading to abnormal neurological function, such as dementia, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. At a cellular level, your cell membrane receptors (the brain of the cell) recognize electromagnetic fields at very low levels of exposure producing a stress response similar to that produced by exposure to heavy metals or toxic chemicals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/02/09/powerful-and-simple-tips-to-help-lower-your-emf-risks.aspx">Source</a></p>

<p><em>Abnormal neurological function</em> is a symptom of EMF damage. I don&#39;t see <em>damage to central nervous system</em> but it&#39;s entirely possible.</p>

<p>From the same source:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Residual Magnetism: Most often this occurs from metal in your bed, which can change its magnetic field. Your body sleeps best in a constant magnetic field, rather than one impacted by metals. (If you hold a liquid-filled compass over your sleeping area, north should always be north; a spinning compass signals residual magnetism).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, make sure that your bed does not contain any metal. The vast majority of beds (90-95 percent) contain metal springs and/or frames. Unfortunately, these metal frames and metal box springs can amplify and distort the earth&#39;s natural magnetic field, which can lead to a non-restful sleep along with a range of other symptoms including:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Headaches</li>
<li>Hyperactivity</li>
<li>Nightmares</li>
<li>Depression and fatigue</li>
<li>Eyestrain</li>
<li>Muscle cramps</li>
</ul>

<p>Research has shown that for your body to properly detoxify during sleep it must be alkaline, and high electromagnetic fields lead to acidity.</p>

<p>Hmm, I wonder if the victims report an acidic or metallic taste along with the onset of symptoms. Who wants to hunt for it?</p>

<p>ONE MORE QUOTE:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Antennas are simply metal objects of appropriate length sized to match the wavelength of a specific frequency of electromagnetic radiation. Just as saxophones are made in different sizes to resonate with and amplify particular wavelengths of sound, electromagnetic waves are selectively amplified by metal objects that are the same, half or one quarter of the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave of a specific frequency. Electromagnetic waves resonate on a half-wavelength antenna to create a standing wave with a peak at the middle of the antenna and a node at each end, just as when a string stretched between two points is plucked at the center. In the U.S. bed frames and box springs are made of metal, and the length of a bed is exactly half the wavelength of FM and TV transmissions that have been broadcasting since the late 1940s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.emfnews.org/articles/your-mattress-could-be-acting-as-a-cancer-causing-radiation-antenna/">Source</a>.</p>

<p>So, Reddit Detectives, we have a theory of how the crime was carried out. Now we need to test it.</p>

<p>The first step, IMO, is to search the science journals and trade magazines. We might even find that sonic weapons already exist that can use box springs to amplify the signal. Who wants to take on this task?</p>

<p>Reading through the above links, I found claims that the EMF amplifying effects of box springs are strongest above the springs where a person lies. So we can hypothesize that the source signal takes advantage of the resonance physics of box springs. It&#39;s tied to their size compared with the source signal Can we verify this? My search keeps leading me back to the same info sources. I&#39;d like to verify or disprove them.</p>

<p>If the above quote is correct about radio and TV frequencies naturally resonating with box springs, it&#39;s not a big leap to seeing how existing tech could be modified to deliver a highly energized, targeted signal to an area the size of, oh, a bed. From what I&#39;ve learned about HAARP, a field full of antennas can be used to hit a distant target (the ionosphere) in a highly targeted way. I picture how a magnifying glass narrows and greatly amplifies lightwaves.</p>

<p>Note in the original AP article I quote, the man who reports what happened was staying on the 14th floor at The Capri. Were the other victims also above ground like that? If so, we have another clue. The device used to generate the signal does not work (or work as well) near ground level. Or the signals produced by the device don&#39;t work. Which leads naturally to the question of &quot;why,&quot; which then leads (perhaps) to the answer of &quot;how.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I got. I look forward to reading your responses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>OK, I went through your links and they appear to confirm in theory that coiled bed springs can act as an antenna and amplifier. They also pick up energy from your environment and actually energize the bed. That&#39;s kinda scary.</p>

<p>I think instead of ELF I meant ULF, which is ultra low frequency. It&#39;s a potentially damaging signal and it&#39;s used with sonic weapons.</p>

<p>So the hypothesis is, the bed springs are used to amplify a ULF signal. The signal would have to be narrowly beamed into the room where the person is in bed. The signal doesn&#39;t have to be particularly strong if bed springs are used to amplify it into the body, but it does have to be very precise to target one person in a hotel. Most likely, the signal is ULF, but I just found other possibilities:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With a thermo camera attached can see thru walls and direct the beam like a torchlight onto person. Less likely to notice when asleep and if person is on their own then others are likely to dismiss their report as mental illness. If they develop dementia or die from heart, kidney etc problems who would consider sonic weapons as a possible cause? That there was several people reporting symptoms at the same venue raised the possibility for some to consider. Amazing1 website sells these type of things for sale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m amazed that no one covering this story in a news organization is exploring how a sonic attack can be done. If you know where the target is (not hard, right?) you can direct a beam of sonic waves directly at them.</p>
