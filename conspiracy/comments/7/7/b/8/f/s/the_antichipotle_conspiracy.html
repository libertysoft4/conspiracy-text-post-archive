        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post is a response to the unsurprising news that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/18/chipotle-downgraded-employee-pay.html">Bank of America has downgraded Chipotle due to their wages being too high</a>.  This will be much shorter than it should be, so I&#39;d urge others to fill in any blanks here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chipotle&#39;s commitment to fresh ingredients and the ethical treatment of animals has helped it achieve massive success over the past two decades. But the chain has hit bumps along the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The concept of an Anti-Chipotle Conspiracy has been smeared for years by well known PR pushers associated with Big-Ag. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/3ynh2r/monsanto_found_guilty_in_french_farmer_poisoning/cyf6iy3/">https://np.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/3ynh2r/monsanto_found_guilty_in_french_farmer_poisoning/cyf6iy3/</a></p>

<p>Chipotle has been in the targets of big-ag, big-food and big-farmer largely since McDonalds fully divested itself from Chipotle in 2006.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>millions of diners, fuelled by concerns about their health and the state of the environment—and propelled by a general distaste for industrially produced and highly processed food—have begun to shun the ubiquitous chains that have long shaped the American culinary character.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The rise of the healthy fast-food chain has been aided by the easing recession, but it comes largely at the expense of traditional competitors. None have struggled more than McDonald’s, one of the world’s most recognizable brands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So who might have paid for this ant-chipotle ad in September 2015?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chipotle-is-the-target-of-a-brutal-new-attack-ad-2015-9">http://www.businessinsider.com/chipotle-is-the-target-of-a-brutal-new-attack-ad-2015-9</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ad, which directs people to the website ChubbyChipotle.com, was printed as a full page in the New York Post on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Chubby Chipotle site goes beyond the deceptive marketing claims and takes aim at Chipotle&#39;s commitment to antibiotic-free meat, saying it&#39;s unhealthy for animals because these medicines are used to treat sick animals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>slamming chipotle for anti-biotic free meat... that certainly sounds like it would come from a certain lobby that relies on factory farming to keep prices low.  very similar talking points to our &quot;pro-scienceFACTS&quot; friends who show up in every reddit thread with GMO in the title.</p>

<p>The ad was paid for by Rick Berman&#39;s &quot;Center for Consumer Freedom&quot;.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coca-Cola Company, Cargill, Inc., Monsanto, Tyson Foods, Outback Steakhouse, Wendy&#39;s, Brinker International and Dean Foods have all contributed to CCF. See CCF funding for a complete list of CCF&#39;s corporate donors.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Berman_%26_Co">https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Berman_%26_Co</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Berman &amp; Co. operates a network of dozens of front groups, attack-dog web sites, and alleged think tanks that work to counteract minimum wage campaigns, keep wages low for restaurant workers, and to block legislation on food safety, secondhand cigarette smoke, and drunk driving and more.[1] In 2013-14, Berman and his Employment Policy Institute &quot;think tank,&quot; have led a national fight against campaigns to raise the minimum wage and to provide paid sick leave for workers with renewed attacks on proponents (including the Center for Media and Democracy, publisher of Sourcewatch), misleading reports, op-eds, TV and radio ads and more</p>

<p>It was at the time of this hit piece campaign (in September 2015), that Chipotle was at its peak valuation, with stock at ~$700-$750/ share from July-October 2015.</p>

<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMG/history?period1=1350532800&amp;amp;period2=1508299200&amp;amp;interval=1mo&amp;amp;filter=history&amp;amp;frequency=1mo">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMG/history?period1=1350532800&amp;amp;period2=1508299200&amp;amp;interval=1mo&amp;amp;filter=history&amp;amp;frequency=1mo</a></p>

<p>Soon after the ad campaign launched- you&#39;ll notice a huge drop in stock valuation during the latter half of October 2015...  What happened?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 3, 2015-- On the heels of an E. coli incident that was linked to eight of its restaurants in Oregon and Washington state, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has taken a number of immediate steps to assist investigators as they conduct their review of the incident in Oregon and Washington. Among the specific actions the company has taken since the incident began are:</p>

<p>Immediately closing 43 restaurants in Oregon and Washington state out of an abundance of caution, even though only eight restaurants have drawn concern, while investigators search for a cause...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://ir.chipotle.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=194775&amp;amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;amp;ID=2106211">http://ir.chipotle.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=194775&amp;amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;amp;ID=2106211</a></p>

<p>Was a cause ever found?  No- even thought a cause is almost always isolated, especially in outbreaks this size.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2015/o26-11-15/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2015/o26-11-15/index.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FDA also conducted investigations of some suppliers, but did not find any evidence that those suppliers were the source of the outbreak. Ultimately, no food item has been identified as causing the outbreak, and by the same token, no food has been ruled out as a cause .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then again in July 2017- they were hit with yet ANOTHER outbreak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a lot of money on the table for Chipotle short sellers—as much as $459 million, according to Allen&#39;s calculations—before there were any inklings of a food safety problem. &quot;Chipotle short-sellers saw their ambitions rewarded with $55 million in less than one day,&quot; he wrote of the latest scare.</p>

<p><strong>Enter iwaspoisoned.com, which Morgan Stanley’s former global head of interest-rates trading-market structure founded in 2009</strong>. This week his site compiled complaints from a single Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. restaurant that promptly sent the burrito chain’s stock price into a tailspin.</p>

<p>Now check out this little tidbit that I&#39;ll end with, regarding the most recent suspicious outbreak in July 2017:</p>

<p>According to our beloved Washington Post, and this CNBC HEADLINE:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chipotle&#39;s recent norovirus outbreak was the result of lax sick-policy enforcement</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/25/chipotles-recent-norovirus-outbreak-could-be-the-result-of-lax-sick-policy-enforcement.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/25/chipotles-recent-norovirus-outbreak-could-be-the-result-of-lax-sick-policy-enforcement.html</a></p>

<p>what did they base that analysis on when the CDC and FDA haven&#39;t reached a conclusion?  Ready for this?  let&#39;s bring it full circle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A self-identified Chipotle employee alleged in a Reddit post last month that a manager required them to work while sick. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>hmmm...  An anonymous Redditor in an ocean of identified PR spewers already promoting anti-Chipotle corporate talking points....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lived in the city where those outbreaks happened. I paid attention to the news at the time. Basically the whole company shut down and reformed from the ground up. The restaurants that were responsible were gross and outdated.  If you go to a Jack in the Box today, it&#39;s spotless, modern, and has pretty good food. If you look back in the kitchen, it looks like a hospital operating room. You never saw the floor so clean in any restaurant kitchen you&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TLDR: </p>

<p>In September 2015, Chipotle was trading at ~$750/ share, when an anonymously financed smear campaign targeted it.  The next month, they started closing stores due to their first NoroVirus outbreak.</p>

<p>Today, they&#39;re trading at half the valuation as two years ago, and it looks like they&#39;ll continue to slide.  Banks blame unsustainable employment and agricultural standards- but the issue is clearly due to mysterious food poisoning scares played up by short-traders for massive profits.</p>

There is a lot of questionable stuff related to the people getting sick over the last few years. I&#39;m no microbiologist but I&#39;ve read that the number of people who got sick was way higher than any natural, accidental,health code violations. Neurovirus was more than likely intentionally placed at restaurants to get a ton of people sick and gain press about it to drive the stock price down. The info you&#39;ve posted makes a lot of sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have worked in food and beverage for over 10 years now.</p>

<p>Employers will lessen hours or fire you if you call out sick at the wrong time(for them/the company ).</p>

<p>More over corporate restaurants, cafes, cafeterias etc will require sick notes and even routinely break laws or go against laws until called out upon such practices, also creating a target on said employees back for pointing out said discrepancies between company policies and practices and state or federal laws.</p>

<p>I am not a shill, despite this being my first post I have been reading here for a long time and had to make a new account. </p>

<p>I also am surprised there&#39;s not more outbreaks and people getting sick from food from what I have seen over the years at many different establishments. With so much food and oil, prep and serving, little bits of food and grease get thrown everywhere, along with moisture in the air from boiling water and other work related processes there is an abundance of chemicals and the right atmosphere for biologics to grow at any time but especially if great care is not taken to keep up and keep sanitized . </p>

<p>Also I like chipotle although only ate it maybe three times lifetime. </p>

Short Answer: No, Chipotle is not owned by McDonald&#39;s. Long Answer: Chipotle became a susidiary of McDonald&#39;s in 1999 when McDonald&#39;s acquired the controlling stake of the company. At one point, McDonald&#39;s owned shares accounting for approximately 87% of the voting power of Chipotle&#39;s common stock.</p>

<p>No, because their cost of labor as a percentage of sales was too high. This is usually caused by inefficient scheduling. Every Chipotle I&#39;ve ever been to had this issue so I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s actually a valid criticism. The rest of the post is sound though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might be in the minority - but I don&#39;t find Chipolte&#39;s food to be appetizing nor appealing.  The &#39;holier than thou&#39; attitude of the customers is a real turn off to most people.  Chipolte fans like to shove in others faces that they eat &#39;ethical&#39; and therefore better than everyone else, a culture of self-righteousness that is a huge turn off.  </p>

<p>As for the food, each time I&#39;ve tried eating there, I&#39;ve never finished my meal as the taste wasn&#39;t good and I always felt sick afterwards, and this was WAY before the e coli scare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post by <a href="/u/know_comment">/u/know_comment</a> is too thoughtful and well-done for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or Reddit in general.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not sarcasm.  Reddit is designed to flush a writer&#39;s work down the memory hole within 2 days or 700 posts, the length of visible threads on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>One year ago, the number of visible threads was 1000, or about 3 days.  Why was this time-window narrowed?</p>

<p>Other conspiracy forums, such as Deep Politics Forum or Rigorous Intuition, display &quot;Threads-By-Topic&quot; that last for years and collect new posts on the same topic.</p>

<p>Instead, Reddit is designed to be a &quot;time sink&quot; and &quot;energy sink&quot; that wastes community effort and energy.</p>

<p>I suggest that serious writers such as <a href="/u/know_comment">/u/know_comment</a> at least cross-post their work to other websites.  If a &quot;Redditor&quot; misses 2 days of an <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> cycle, or doesn&#39;t wade through all 700 posts, good work like this is easily missed.</p>

<p>Real people don&#39;t go to or avoid fast food places like Chipotle because of &quot;fresh ingredients and the ethical treatment of animals,&quot; whether the animals had antibiotics, or whether some store out there had E Coli or something. Only advertisers and an extremely small demographic of people care about that stuff (or use those words). </p>

<p>Obviously in the minority here as reddit loves this place, but it&#39;s expensive an nowhere near as good as most legit Mexican places. Never understood the appeal to anyone in California especially. Just a little basic spanish and I&#39;m swimming in cabeza burritos for $5.50 the length of my forearm at my local spot, and it&#39;s not rare. Guess it&#39;s just paying extra for comfort because it&#39;s certainly not tastier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live up north, but been all over the state many times and there&#39;s incredible Mexican food everywhere. Even way up north in the more devoted coastal towns have surprised me.</p>

<p>Been to every state west of the Mississippi tons of times and the same is true. Most areas I&#39;ve been to in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, etc have awesome Mexican as well. But it&#39;s rarely in a mall, or next to a bunch of shops etc so people don&#39;t bother or are just scared. Chipotle is more convenient, so people settle. I&#39;ve had it before a few times, it&#39;s more expensive and nothing compared to even barely decent legit spots. But it&#39;s the same old battle: people love domino&#39;s but obviously the 50 year old mom and pop place in town is probably better. People love burger King but obviously the new grass-fed, crazy styled spot is better. People like Chipotle.....etc etc etc. It&#39;s convenience really. </p>

<p>Why experience an authentic Mexican taqueria or carniceria when you can walk from Starbucks to the Chipotle next door in comfort?</p>

<p>Yes, I understand that the BOA downgrading was due to high employment costs as a percentage of revenue- and yes I could have represented that better in my post.</p>

<p>Fast casual is still competing with fast-food in the same wage market.   You&#39;re right that it&#39;s not vastly superior in that regards- my point is that they&#39;re being TARGETED with talking points that make people question whether higher wages are a sustainable model.</p>

<p>this is the type of contextual critical thinking that I appreciate.  But most people just don&#39;t have the context, so they assume that your context is misguided.  But if you have context, it&#39;s easy to see that there&#39;s fuckery here.</p>

<p>interestingly- this NYT story (which I&#39;m pretty sure is a Native Ad)is showing up right next to the Chipotle story on Google:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/business/mcdonalds-earnings.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/business/mcdonalds-earnings.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Promotions including $1 beverages and the “McPick 2” value menu helped lift comparable store sales — or sales at stores open at least 13 months — 6 percent globally in the most recent quarter.</p>

<p>Such promotions reflect a revamped effort at McDonald’s to focus more on value-conscious fare — including a plan to introduce a $1, $2 and $3 value menu next year — executives confirmed during a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The value menu at mcdonalds has always been a loss-leader.  It brings in CUSTOMERS, not profit.  </p>

<p>Fast food franchises have long had a love-hate relationship with dollar menus and other cheapie promotions. Naturally, owners love any deals that drive traffic into their restaurants. Yet as far back as 2007 (per MarketWatch), restaurant owners griped about being forced to sell “loss leaders” such as the McDonald&#39;s Double Cheeseburger for just $1. Among other things, the presence of robust dollar menu selections is seen as a prime reason that fast food sales of combo meals have slowed, as have sales of other items that are far more profitable than stuff selling for merely a buck.</p>
