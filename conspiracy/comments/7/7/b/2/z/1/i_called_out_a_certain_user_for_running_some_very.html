<p>You can take a look for yourself exactly what kind of subreddits this guy is running...but be warned you will feel gross afterwards.  </p>

<p>It all started when I posted this submission <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7743f5/a_young_charlize_theron/">https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7743f5/a_young_charlize_theron/</a>.  <a href="/u/HerefortheWildCat">/u/HerefortheWildCat</a> commented on the pic, but another user quickly called him out on the subreddits he was running...he quickly deleted his comment, but I didn&#39;t want him to get away free so I made sure to make a separate independent comment calling him out: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QwjUuvl.png">https://i.imgur.com/QwjUuvl.png</a>. My comment was gaining a lot of traction, but it eventually got deleted...I decided to try again, and I went to the very top post of Reddit and made sure to call out <a href="/u/HerefortheWildCat">/u/HerefortheWildCat</a> for his shady activities again: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PpUQjAo.png">https://i.imgur.com/PpUQjAo.png</a>.  This time my comment was gaining A LOT of traction, and I was hoping this would lead to the shutdown of his subreddits.  But, alas, this comment too was quickly deleted.  Since this whole fiasco <a href="/u/HerefortheWildCat">/u/HerefortheWildCat</a> has <em>still</em> been posting content....look I understand the internet is a depraved place, I&#39;m not really one to judge people BUT there are certain lines that shouldn&#39;t be crossed.  Whether this is a conspiracy or not...I really don&#39;t give a shit; I just want those disgusting subreddits shut down.</p>

<p>Edit: Just for clarification&#39;s sake...when I&#39;m logged in my comments in the threads show normally but when I log out they show as deleted.  The first comment I made was deleted within roughly an hour, the second one I&#39;m not sure...I wrote it, went to sleep, and when I woke up it was gone (that&#39;s why the screenshots of my comments are normal...because I took them while I was logged in).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP seems to post mostly in IRLgirls. I took a look at freshmodels and I can see what the fuss is about.</p>

<p>Having said that, I can also see why p53Rb got his comments deleted. Why? Probably witch hunting or harassment. </p>

<p>Yes, those subs have content featuring what look like young teenage girls. But it&#39;s non-sexual and there&#39;s no nudity. Some people might not like this, but the content does not seem to violate reddit&#39;s terms of use.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an old saying that &quot;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder&quot;. In the same way, so is sexuality. To a young person or someone with a sister or child who wants to do modeling, these pictures are no big deal. Same thing goes for gymnastics.</p>

<p>So you can criticize, but what do you do? Get the subs banned? Then what? What if op opens a new sub with a different name and &quot;slightly tamer&quot; pics?</p>

<p>The thing is, there has to be a point where people generally agree on what&#39;s OK. Right now, reddit says pics of teens/pre-teen girls are OK if the pics are non-nude and non-sexual.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t check out all 3 subs, but didn&#39;t see any nudity in the first one. </p>

<p>Also, this situation is kind of like a Rorshach test. If you look at a pic of a 14 year old girl and think it&#39;s sexual, doesn&#39;t that say almost about you as it does about the pic?</p>

<p>Except use of the word &quot;fresh&quot; is part of the pedo culture. That&#39;s strike 1. Then there&#39;s kids in tight clothing, strike 2. Then there are kids in poses more in line with what one sees in adult women, strike 3. </p>

<p>I get what you&#39;re saying, as it is a subjective thing. However, it&#39;s still discernible. Hence, why normally articulate justices have said on a closely related topic [paraphrasing], &quot;I may not be able to define [pornographic] obscenity, but I know it when I see it.&quot; There are enough red flags in this case that I think the same is true with these subs.</p>

<p>In spite of all of this, no, I don&#39;t think the subreddits should be banned... but do I think the user&#39;s a pedo and these pics are posted with ulterior motives? With near certainty. </p>

<p>OK, to be honest, I&#39;d wonder about the guy too. But really, if there&#39;s no rules/laws being broken and nobody being victimized... why get all worked up about it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, &quot;fresh&quot; is synonymous with &quot;young&quot; unfortunately. To prove my point would require saturating my search history with keywords I don&#39;t particularly want in my browser... but as an off-the-cusp example Sibel Edmonds (FBI whistleblower) had her pedo character in her book, &quot;The Lone Gladio&quot; use this terminology as well. </p>

<p>As for why everyone here is getting worked up, I get it. As said, I don&#39;t think this sub should get banned, but that doesn&#39;t take away the fact that Reddit <em>has</em> banned perfectly legal subs for far flimsier reasons than this (fat people hate comes to mind: offensive, but not illegal). </p>

<p>In addition, social media sites have consistently engaged in what could be perceived as cover ups for pedophiles and have been quick with the banhammer towards people who point it out. Shutting down the p-gate subreddit is a good example, as was deleting any mention of pegasus museum and the art in embassies program. In some cases it&#39;s more obvious: Do you remember when 0_hour got banned when he came across and reported a bunch of Twitter users trading in what was legitimately illegal cp... while many in the ring <em>didn&#39;t</em> get banned? I do. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a huge double standard, and it&#39;s not in the direction that one would think. </p>

<p>Another possibility that OP didn&#39;t consider. The sub is run by law enforcement. Host a few subs with questionable but legal content, then advertise them by complaining about them.</p>

<p>Then hang around and see who subscribes, who posts new content, who makes interesting pms fishing for &quot;better stuff&quot; or even contact info.</p>

<p>Imo, this is another reasonable explanation for why these subs (and others like them) are still up.</p>

<p>Oh, so you have knowledge of what I &quot;internally understand&quot;? Based on said knowledge, you are able to state that I &quot;have no clue about any of this&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take your word for it. When I checked his profile last night, I didn&#39;t see his age posted, and that is my main concern. Is it feasible to think a shitty underage boy could could be a moderator? I honestly have no idea the work load or mental acuity needed to handle those kind of tasks. Also, if you all figure out he really is a deviant, there&#39;s probably more of them in his circle, if you rush to bust him, you could lose his cohorts. And remember, he probably also has family or friends that don&#39;t deserve to get caught up in it even though it&#39;s inevitable to some extent, so just take care ok. I just wanted to weigh in because I think being falsely accused of something like this would be absolutely horrible but im way outta my depth here and remarkably inept at navigating the more technical aspects of the online world, despite the amount of time I spend online, so I&#39;m just gonna leave it up to those who know better. </p>

<p>Just because something isn&#39;t &quot;as bad&quot; as something else doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t be posted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And why report to the FBI</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure most people here realize that, from what I saw anyway, those images are legal.</p>

<p>But, sometimes these subs that are nothing but 10-13 year old girls in bathing suits, makeup, etc are sort of fronts for finding people who are interested in that sort of thing. They can then PM one another and talk about/share links and photos that are much more sinister.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a big red flag that should probably be looked into.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(shills inbound...) </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m curious, why add that to your comment?</p>

<p>Elsagate rabbit hole just got deeper.</p>

<p>One comment led me to YouTube nude yoga. First few hits are normal enough, fit women doing nude yoga.</p>

<p>Then after clicking a few, the sidebar changes and you start seeing nothing but Russian kids doing &#39;yoga&#39; which amounts to twerking and upskirts/downblouse type shit.</p>

<p>Same ludicrous amount of views as the Elsa vids. Same weird comment chains and odd references...</p>

<p>I backed out before going deeper as my skin was crawling.</p>

<p>Twilight zone shit.</p>

No fake and photoshopped images allowed.
No sexual innuendos in the comments.

<p>The top posts of this subreddit are all ones of them wearing either the least amount of clothes possible or doing yoga poses. </p>

<p>Look at some of the users who comment there (or post). You&#39;ll notice a good deal of them only view porn subreddits and &quot;not porn just totally normally pictures of little girls&quot; subreddits. </p>

<p>If you look at a pic of a 14 year old girl and think it&#39;s sexual, doesn&#39;t that say almost about you as it does about the pic?</p>

<p>Except use of the word &quot;fresh&quot; is part of the pedo culture. That&#39;s strike 1. Then there&#39;s kids in tight clothing, strike 2. Then there are kids in poses more in line with what one sees in adult women, strike 3. </p>

<p>I get what you&#39;re saying, as it is a subjective thing. However, it&#39;s still discernible. Hence, why normally articulate justices have said on a closely related topic [paraphrasing], &quot;I may not be able to define [pornographic] obscenity, but I know it when I see it.&quot; There are enough red flags in this case that I think the same is true with these subs.</p>

<p>In spite of all of this, no, I don&#39;t think the subreddits should be banned... but do I think the user&#39;s a pedo and these pics are posted with ulterior motives? With near certainty. </p>
