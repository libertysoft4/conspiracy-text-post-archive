<blockquote>
<p>The 2006 Mexico DC-9 drug bust (also called &#39;Cocaine 1&#39; because it was painted to impersonate a US government plane)[1] followed after the emergency landing of an aging DC-9 which was not fit to fly.[2] On April 10, 2006, en route from from Venezuela to USA, this suffered an engine failure and made an emergency landing in Mexico, where its cargo of over 5 tonnes of cocaine was discovered. Michael Braun, Chief of Operations of the DEA testified to the US Congress that 5.6 tonnes of cocaine were found aboard the plane.[3] Arrests were made, but the pilot and the plane both &quot;disappeared&quot;. </p>

<p>In April,2006 it was revealed that a plane owned by Skyway Communications of Lakeland,Florida and Royal Sons holding company using Huffman Aviation(where Mohamed Atta trained before 9/11),as its address and paradoxically rented by the Howard Dean&#39;s Democrat presidential campaign of 2004 had been busted by the Mexican army at the Ciudad Del Carmen,Campeche airport on the Yucatan Peninsula with over 5.5 tons of cocaine on board.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The aircraft was originally manufactured in 1966 for Trans-World Airlines as N1061T. It had a long career flying for various individuals and companies, including Tracinda Investment (N241TC), Kenny Rogers (N9KR), Southmark Corporation (N89SM), the Seattle Seahawks (N40SH), Aircraft 45775, Inc, and HW Aviation. It &quot;was Howard Dean&#39;s presidential campaign plane in 2004&quot;.

<p>It is not unreasonable to take the position that the degrees of separation between politicians and planes that crash with cocaine is inexplicably high.</p>

<p>Howard Dean is a politician and is, therefore, of interest to the intelligence community that also deals drugs.</p>

<p>Another intellectually dishonest tactic. Putting words in my mouth.</p>

<p>I merely said all politicians were of interest to the intelligence community. Certainly, plenty of them are active participants. If you deny either of those assertions, then you maybe need to start doing some research about the history of espionage going back to Chapter 13 of the Art of War.</p>

<p>All politicians of every country are of interest to the intelligence community and worth spying on and or compromising in some way.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty narrow minded to think that the crimes stop at drug trafficking. Especially since things like the Iran Contra Scandal and other blatantly unethical and illegal activities have been and continue to be conducted by the intelligence community.</p>

<p>nothing to do with right and left this has to do with distortion of facts.

    <div class="md"><p>But if you sold ten cars and five of them crashed with cocaine, your metaphor would actually be closer to the truth.</p>

<p>Fair attempt, though.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that the CIA is confirmed to be participating in the drug trade in far more ways than just crashed planes. Then... you add in the crashed planes that, once again, are involved in politics THEN crash with cocaine... it&#39;s happened too many times.</p>

<p>So, while you two are getting emotional about Howard Dean, I feel it is intellectually dishonest, because the CIA it was is implicated. The political machine is implicated.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t an irrelevant fact that it was his campaign plane, though.</p>

<p>Given all of the coincidences regarding Uranium One that I posted about over a year ago coming true, it wouldn&#39;t be a stretch to see that Dean is somehow involved even if it is just cartel money and Russian money ending up in his campaign coffers.</p>

<p>There is zero reason to bring Dean&#39;s name into it except for shock value, it has no bearing on the plane, the drugs, the CIA, or the CIA dealing drugs. YOU are making is a left/right thing by using Dean&#39;s name and sources doing the same. This is the exact definition of partisan politics. </p>
