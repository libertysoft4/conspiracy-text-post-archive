I&#39;m COMPLETELY sold that this thing is messy and not what it seems, and I&#39;m never in to the whole conspiracy thing.  But, I was thinking why no video of him even carrying some big bags, obviously containing weapons, nothing of him sitting at a table gambling, taking a stroll??  All I&#39;ve seen is some old video of him, walking like a 90 year old, slipping on a floor.  The FBI released video of the Boston Bombers within days since they were looking for some people... This gonna down like the JFK incident or what?  An update would sure be nice, and not from some rehearsed &quot;security guard&quot;.</p>

<p>since the self-proclaimed puppet masters haven&#39;t given us anything, I&#39;m willing to go with the theory that it was a <em>blood sacrifice</em> for whomever was at the top of the Luxor that evening.</p>

<p>Funny you say that. In one of the videos I definitely saw a shadow in the beam at the top of the Luxor. But I heard somewhere it would fry a human up there.</p>

<p>If you think about it the official story rules out any reason to keep this evidence suppressed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was about 12 when that all happened, and being a 12 year old male from america, I didn&#39;t pay much attention.  This entire thing is insane.  I mean, you have to hunt to even find a mention of the worst massacre in the US with guns on cnn&#39;s website.  Yet, for how long did they have that James Holmes all over it, or that rich midget who went up to females in so cal, or the san bernidino shooters.  Hell, we got reporters actually going through their things in their apartment.  Yet, nothing.  It just creates this need to fill in the void by us.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, that&#39;s a good point.  I know the FBI has got to be leading the investigation.  Regardless of what they put out in the media about this  being some lone wolf, millionaire whom I heard actually liked country music and liked concerts.  This clown supposedly rented that big ass room, and then a smaller room in front of his, joined together by a door you can leave open... This reminds me of stings.  With cameras set up, but not recording?  All his guns lined up, looking like a gun store... from what a man who actually ran guns for the feds says, is what he used to do.  He was prepared to leave the room, yet kills himself?  With 20 guns in the room and thousands of rounds?  Kills himself before cops even get there.  Why were they checking rooms, floor by floor?  Since they obviously knew it was the 32nd floor with this Jesus fatty getting shot.  Something, somewhere, make sense after 3 weeks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the room was one of their typical suites. Most MGM suites are setup similar I’ve stayed in a few. It’s one door. Two bedrooms on each side with a big living/kitchen/dining area in between the two.</p>

<p>Oh for sure it’s all fishy, and unfortunately we’ll probably never know what REALLY happened wether the narrative is true or not. We’ll never have 100% of the story. </p>

<p>One narrative fits with theirs, ONE. And if they say it differently something else went down —</p>

<p>For some reason — someone complained to staff about noise as Paddock is setting up everything — be it cameras in the hall, a guy lugging guns upstairs, etc.</p>

<p>Jesus gets word, and heads up to investigate. Confronts Paddock before he’s actually ready to start what he was planning. He runs into Jesus and shoots at him, hits him, realizes he probably won’t have much time before the cops show up at his room. Turns around, does all the damage he can before the guns need to be reloaded or are jammed, then takes his own life.</p>

<p>THIS is all that fits. The problem is there’s no proof. There’s no video of Paddock heading through the hotel with bags of guns, no video of ANYTHING. They could’ve released a 2 second clip of him showing up to the hotel for God’s sake. The story their telling keeps getting mixed up. They said he was planning to get away, explosives in the car, why not just walk out the hotel and blend in with heards of people? If he wanted to get away he could have. All we have is leaked pictures from some scum site 4chan showing a guy dead on the floor in the room with two bullet holes in his chest and a few guns spread around with little to no shells on the ground after firing 1000’s. The only fucking witness to Paddock disappears for days from interviews and magically shows up on Ellen??? Of all fucking places????? I confused myself typing this out, none of it makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I thought he actually rented 2 rooms.  1 being that big ass suite that wraps around, then just a normal room that is connected to that suite.  Because those 2 windows blown out, aren&#39;t both in that suite.  1 is in a completely different hotel room than the suite... the other one he rented.  Let&#39;s not forget, his hotel room service receipt says guests: 2.  </p>

<p>Have you watched that video on youtube that&#39;s about a half hour long, that the guy examines the sounds, and has all these equations for why there were 2 shooters.  One from where Paddock was, and 1 that was closer.  Have you watched any of the people who were actually at the concert and were almost certain there was 2 shooters no matter where they ran, bullets followed.  Why did the lights click on, right when the bullets start flying, then after he&#39;s all done, the lights turn off.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get any of it.  From the Sheriff saying that he planned on escaping, and the reporters ask why he says that, and he can&#39;t say.  But he shoots himself??  He has 20 guns!!  If his rifle jammed, pick another one up, there were magazines just laying there, waiting to be used.  No mention of it on msm websites.  Fucking guy showing up on Ellen!?!</p>

<p>I&#39;m subscribing to the theory that this asshole was with the FBI slangin&#39; guns.  Washing his money at the casino&#39;s.  How many regular fucks do you know that &quot;make&quot; money gambling.  From what they say, he gambled those video poker machines... not even blackjack, craps or roulette, where I&#39;d think your chances are a tad bit better than some computer game.</p>

<p>I just got off work doing construction out of town, so I don&#39;t have my normal set up, watching youtube videos on my TV, and also on 1 of my computer monitors.  Was hoping some more stuff might&#39;ve come out.  I&#39;m buying in to the fact that he rented that car in arizona, went and got guns, drove to Vegas on the 20th.  I mean if he had all those guns in his car, he would&#39;ve had to of unloaded all those bags up to his room before returning that car.  Let&#39;s not forget, you&#39;d have to have more bags for ammo, his clothes, his computers and phones...  Makes me want to quit my job and go to Vegas and find out just wtf they&#39;re hiding.</p>
