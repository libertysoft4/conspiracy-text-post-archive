        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve always been pretty moderate with my political views. The bias that I generally operate under is that of skepticism of government and media. </p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly impartial re: Trump. I understand why his antics upset many people, but I also appreciate his success in the current political arena. Considering his wealth and connections, I&#39;ve been very skeptical of him being a true outsider.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t understand is the extreme bias of the media against Trump. It is too extreme to simply be a tactic to keep the masses pitted against each other. Or even to maintain the illusion of Trump being an outsider.  It seems to be a truly desperate attempt to remove him from office and have Pence, a 100% establishment republican, take his place. </p>

<p>And the desperation of the left and establishment right continues to grow. So does anyone have a theory as to why this is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. And I&#39;m having a hard time believing that he is. </p>

<p>The only thing that keeps me from committing to the idea that he is establishment is the fact that, on the surface, it really seems that the establishment is doing everything they can to get rid of him.</p>

<p>And then the only thing that keeps me from believing he&#39;s actually a threat to the establishment is that they havent killed him yet. There&#39;s no way they&#39;d risk it if Trump were actually a lose cannon or had any intent on taking them down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right. The Weinstein fall was too orchestrated. I think it was intended to show that the left and Hollywood are willing to severely punish one of their most powerful members for repeated allegations of sexual assault. Now all they have to do is credibly accuse Trump of the same crimes in the same manner (no idea if they will be true or not), and demand his resignation. Everyone will point to Harvey Weinstein as an example of what should be done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that seems like a pretty dangerous game for the establishment. I think the insane anti-Trump antics of the media are so transparent that too many ppl are catching on. It leads to a certain cultural switch where ppl start questioning the media. And that leads to questioning the establishment. </p>

<p>I dont think this widespread rejection of the las vegas shooting narrative would be as rejected by the public, if a large percentage of the public wasnt already skeptical of the media. And I think a decent percentage of those skeptics are a result of Trump</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are reading it right. The Democrats, Republicans, Media and Hollywood is totally against him at all costs. Even if you think he is primarily a narcissist who is out for himself (which I think is very possible), he is not controlled by THEM. They never have to deal with a president who isn&#39;t a total puppet. They haven&#39;t had to do so since JFK. Even if Trump is evil, he is not their puppet. The total shitfit in the news and in Hollywood is an indication of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this theory covers all the bases for me.</p>

<p>Plus, it&#39;s the simplest. </p>

<p>Conspiratorial thinking can obviously be a rabbit hole. Skepticism of the official narrative is imperative for discerning truth, but it can easily devolve into an addictive ideology where ppl sincerely think the earth is flat or that there weren&#39;t any victims at vegas. </p>

<p>Most often, the simplest explanation is the correct one. Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a long time, there has been a bipartisan consensus about how the world should be ran.  It is often referred to as the Washington consensus. </p>

<p>You have networks of think-thanks, corporations and government agencies which have a kind of bureaucratic inertia to them, pushing the world in a particular direction.  Concerning foreign policy the long term geopolitical machinations behind the &#39;DOD&#39; do not change with each administration. Each administration is acquainted and conforms to these machinations.</p>

<p>People usually end up putting in their time participating in these networks, they do the think-thank circuits, occupy various government positions, serve on corporate boards, attend the American Business Council meetings, or CFR corporate round tables, all the while being groomed and vetted for higher office. </p>

<p>Trump did not do this, he participated in the corporate world, but not the rest of the &#39;deep state&#39;.   So it is not so much that he is an &#39;outsider&#39;, it is more he has to learn the game, and it was not known will he play, nor what kind of player  he will be.  </p>

<p>Think of the media campaign as only one force attempting to steer.  If he deviates from, lets say, the foreign policy consensus he will be mercilessly attacked as an attempt to check the direction he is headed.    The question is now, does he know the game, and did he decide to play it just like his predecessors? </p>

<p>Trump is to the left of 1996 Clinton. Republicans have even seceded the idea that healthcare shouldnt be a federal entitlement. However, throw some asterisks on Obamacare and call it Trumpcare and, all the sudden, millions of ppl are going to die while the rich get richer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, it was pretty obvious with Trumps past statements too. He called Hillary a great Secretary of State until he decided to be a nominee. Frankly if you listen to his Rally&#39;s he doesn&#39;t even hide it. He told a story at one Rally how one guy yelled &quot;drain the swamp&quot;, Trump than repeated it and people cheered. He did it at his next rally to applause.</p>

<p>Now you might think this is me telling you what Trump said. But this is actually a story he told at one rally and he&#39;s telling them like they are in on the joke and everyone&#39;s face is just blank. It&#39;s all a play put on.</p>

<p>Frankly I think they all do that but Trumps the only one who&#39;ll literally tell people he just says it for applause.</p>

<p>I even understand why he said that. He was trying to imply that Comey was pursuing a crazy investigation that didn&#39;t have any merit.</p>

<p>He was basically doing the same thing when he said that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower before the election. He said it because he was trying to use it to make a point. He wanted to spread the idea that the Obama wiretapping didn&#39;t find anything. It backfired on him.</p>

<p>Donald Trump says whatever comes to mind. He doesn&#39;t really think most of it through before he says it. It&#39;s not at all uncommon for him.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s seeing intelligence that isn&#39;t there that got the dumbass elected. He&#39;s a pretty good con man and doesn&#39;t have any morality to restrict his actions. That&#39;s how he was successful in business.</p>

<p>At first people were talking about Donald playing 4D chess. They&#39;re not even saying that anymore. He&#39;s proven time and time again that he&#39;s only playing checkers. And he&#39;s doing it badly.</p>

<p>They probably started grooming Donald Trump for all of this back when he went bankrupt. They may not have had a use for him at the time but KGB trained Russians aren&#39;t going to let someone like that go unnoticed. A fast talking American business man can be very useful. They&#39;ve had him compromised for many years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve said this before, I’ll say it again. IF Trump is part of TPTB, shit goes downhill fast.</p>

<p>IF Trump is a white hat working in collusion with other white hats to stop TPTB, things go downhill faster.</p>

<p>Why? Because then TPTB are forced to expedite their game. Which means they will create any chaos possible to cause any situation to look worse on Trump’s watch. The media started programming the masses to despise him early in the campaign, and the game has escalated dramatically ever since. </p>

<p>To be fair sometimes Trump swaggers and days cheesy shit, but hey maybe it’s 5D chess, let them underestimate you so they don’t see you coming.</p>

<p>Fact is, as soon as he got in office, most of his executive orders were anti globalist legislation designed to stop NWO growth. His refusal to sign the Paris Agreement didn’t stem from an anti environmental perspective, he knew that shit was Agenda 21 and designed to enslave the world. His stance had been the same as Le Pen, Putin and others who have shot down their willingness to play ball with the NWO. Sure, he’s had bad cabinet members, but that’s to be expected. Anyone in there wanting the status quo would advise him to keep the sharks while telling them they’re “on the team”. He’s not going to catch every swamp creature in the first few months. It’s ludicrous to think so. It comes with trial and error and knowing that he Is in a swamp. You can’t drain it without battling monsters and you’re going to take scars. It’s unavoidable.</p>

<p>If he’s truly white hat, he’s doing fine for battling an entire swamp. Maybe the time had come in our society where we finally know what we’re fighting, and what we have to do to take it down. Dining think of Trump as just a President. He’s just one cog in a machine of many white hats trying to reverse ages of insanity in politics and shadow government. </p>

<p>I think if he was just another Bush or Clinton or Obama, the powers that be would have continued their endgame a lot more stealthily. That would be in their advantage. But they are exhibiting behaviors of panic, getting sloppy in their tactics, and to anyone watching the entire geopolitical story play out, especially over an arc of decades, it’s easy to see that he is in fact a wild card.</p>

<p>It’s up to him to decide what path to take, good or evil, but every minute of his life he has to play chess, and that means keeping friends close and enemies closer. IF he is a good guy, he’s been willing to sacrifice his entire reputation and his business and retirement and a peaceful productive life, for what!?!?! Constant headaches? Threats? Total bullshit???? </p>

<p>I don’t view Trump as some USA president here in 2017. He seems like a logical byproduct to a corrupt world. Like LePen and others. So HOPEFULLY he’s the real deal.</p>

<p>Having said that, we must watch every single move he makes, but I say that about every public servant there is. After all they’re supposed to work for us, not this screwball deep state insanity we have. If Trump can’t help reverse if, I hope someone else can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree on the Paris Agreement. If Trump wanted to move the country toward globalism on that issue, I&#39;m confident he could have persuaded his base to accept the Paris Agreement (something like, &quot;ok the facts arent in on climate change, but we all want clean air, right?&quot;). The right is so tribal with Trump, that I really think he could lead them just about anywhere. Or, at least do some beta testing with his base and see where theyre willing to go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would they hate the man who&#39;s appointing Goldman Sachs to his cabinet, giving the CIA more drone powers, expanding the military budget, and ramping up for more war while continuing the ones already started? TPTB love him because he can distract and divide the populace while they continue doing the same thing they&#39;ve always done. Left wing media hates the republican president, just like right wing media hated the democrat presidents. TPTB love him because people will focus on him and his tweets rather than what the government is actually doing. </p>
