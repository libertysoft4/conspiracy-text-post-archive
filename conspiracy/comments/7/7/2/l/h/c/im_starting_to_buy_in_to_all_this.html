    <div class="md"><p>Right. Thank you. Pertinent information. </p>

<p>Since you need someone to put it in simpler terms: we all know there is widespread vote manipulation via not and discussion dilution/distraction, all for the sake of pushing an agenda. Multiple subs, many agendas- big or small, political or marketing. </p>

<p>Can you see how timeout rules may be so easily manipulated by these agenda driving parties?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you explain what you view as &quot;an agenda&quot; and also explain why you don&#39;t expect nearly every subreddit to have one? From <a href="/r/pol">/r/pol</a> to TD to Kotakuinaction to conspiracy to srs, all subreddits are subject of the rules that their mods deem appropriate. All subreddits have communities with ideals that somewhat align, communities that downvote lies and / or dissenting opinions.</p>

<p>It would help if people weren&#39;t constantly trolling. Mods wouldn&#39;t be so quick to implement these rules and communities wouldn&#39;t be so quick to reject benghazi-level nonsense.</p>

<p>And if you want an example of how this &quot;agenda bs&quot; is happening everywhere, look no further than our sub right here. China gave Trump&#39;s daughter numerous patents as part of a deal with our president. But we saw crickets here, nothing, zilch, nada, because almost no one in this community cares if the conspiracy points to a conservative.</p>

<p>Should pol be the opposite of that and make it so that no one cares if a conspiracy points to a leftist? Absolutely not. But Obama, Hillary... these people aren&#39;t in office. They&#39;re not accepting bribes <em>right now</em> like every other politician currently in office</p>

<p>And I see you&#39;re still caught up in partisan bullshit. Obama, Hillary, and Trump are all on the same team. You act like it&#39;s a given every politician is corrupt, then claim that Obama and Hillary are not taking bribes simply because they are no longer in office haha. </p>

<p>Still doesn&#39;t change the fact the 9 minute rule is easily manipulated by bots and shills.</p>

Calling Bernie a communist on his sub gets the same reaction. I think you&#39;re pretending that the pol sub is an even mix of all viewpoints when it&#39;s not.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It&#39;s happened to me a lot when I first started. I think it has to do with average karma on a subreddit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a leftist in every sense except I oppose gun control. I buy into the hillary did  Benghazi nonsense about as much as I buy into the NRA being responsible for the Vegas shooting, which means I don&#39;t buy it. I was being downvoted on most of my comments because I think it&#39;s silly to push the debunked 9/11 trutherism and pizzagate instead of pushing questions about Michael Hastings or Pat Tillman. This crowd doesn&#39;t like that... those deaths don&#39;t help a right-wing agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well when you come here and say you can&#39;t buy into the 9/11 truth, you&#39;ll get downvoted because it&#39;s been proven that it didn&#39;t happen like we were told.

    <div class="md"><p>There are no &quot;leaders in their field&quot; who dispute that 9/11 was terrorists who smashed planes into the WTC filled with enough jet fuel to cause a collapse from the burning. The people you refer to, they are fringe weirdoes without any sort of reputation at stake, starved for attention or filled with too much ignorance to look at the facts and make a sound judgement. I have seen actual experiments showing that jet fuel can weaken steel beams enough to make them bend like jello. And that experiment was done outdoors, not <em>inside</em> where the heat is trapped.</p>

<p>I was a truther for a long time. And each and every point that I believed to be lies, I looked long and hard to find out why the government was covering things up. Eventually I realized that there is no conspiracy other than negligence... that some things like the WTC falling or the moon landing are too grand or too complicated for small minds (like mine at the time) to fathom what was actually happening.</p>

<p>Regarding pizzagate, you&#39;re being facetious. Harvey Weinstein is a perv and has no connection to Comet Pizza. Also, he hasn&#39;t been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting toddlers. </p>

<p>Please explain to me how jet fuel burning in a building for hours and hours will not cause it to collapse. Don&#39;t run off and continue peddling the BS. I am challenging you to challenge yourself and provide me with the details you believe to be proof of the conspiracy so that I might be able to enlighten you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain WTC Building 7...What conspiracies do you even believe in then? I wasn&#39;t attacking you but you came right at me for what I know as the truth and I was being polite...</p>

<p>No other building in the history of building fires has ever collapsed. If you were a truther you should already know the facts I believe. The men and women that have shown 9/11 didn&#39;t happen like we were told aren&#39;t fringe weirdos, looking for attention. They want people to know the truth. You&#39;ve seen actual experiments, good to know. These structural engineers and scientists have also done models. How about the recent report from University of Alaska Fairbanks saying it was a controlled demolition. So you&#39;re saying a reputable university doesn&#39;t know shit?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Weinstein was involved in Comet Ping Pong. Stop thinking that is what PEDOgate is. The world is full of pedophiles in politics, in Hollywood, where ever there is powerful people you&#39;ll find pedophiles...Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment of underage girls...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off you are exhibiting common truther symptoms. You called my rebuttal an attack but it wasn&#39;t. If you are looking for truth, the first rule is that you can&#39;t be stubborn. Getting defensive is being stubborn. Present counterpoints, don&#39;t &quot;defend yourself&quot; because you&#39;re nervous that you might be wrong. Prove why you&#39;re <em>not</em> wrong.</p>

<p>To what you said: you are right that this hasn&#39;t happened at any other time in history because no one has dumped that much jet fuel in such a condensed area of buildings. Richard Gage is a known liar. He is behind that UAF study. Please show me why his words mean more than 99.99% of other engineers and scientists? </p>

<p>Building 7 went down because of debris and jet fuel, and a fire burning for hours and hours and hours.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t lean on other fringe studies or characters to say that you&#39;re right. Show me the specific facts that they&#39;ve stated in the studies, facts that you agree with.</p>

<p>Regarding &quot;pedogate&quot; i have nothing to say and that&#39;s not what I want to debate. We are in agreement that Hollywood has perverts and that pedophiles seek entering that &quot;lifestyle&quot; just as priests do because it&#39;s easy prey. We agree on more in that regard than you&#39;d guess but comet pizza is uninvolved and i don&#39;t think a discussion or debate about it would benefit either of us.</p>

<p>But if you want to present science or data to point to any WTC building going down as a result of a demolition, that <em>will</em> help, because if you keep an open mind and trust that some people would not risk their reputations by spreading blatant lies, you will learn what really happened</p>

<p>They also have farms on indians downvoting anything remotely protrump including legit news stories that even suggest a possibility of a pro trump outcome.</p>

<p>How people aren&#39;t seeing through all this is honestly mindboggling.</p>

<p>The masses are pathetic at the moment. I got drunk last night at a bar and some dude was being rude as hell for no reason and i left a full beer and yelled at the whole bar about how this guy is a complete asshole. Then my uber driver was a black guy and we got into a convo about how democrats are racist and its all scam.</p>

<p>The true racists and intolerant idiots are all on the left and they are infecting society with a cold rudeness.</p>

<p>People are so hyped up and immersed in lies that they arent even warm to strangers anymore. </p>

<p>And its no wonder, when its now a question of whether people should even respect the national anthem.</p>

<p>Our society has a rotten core that is being exposed and the masses are doing everything they can to pretend its not.</p>

<p>Did anybody care to begin with? Can the masses distinguish between <strong>objective</strong> and <strong>subjective</strong> truth? The father of crowd psychology <a href="https://imgur.com/oQbHvhu">says NO</a>.</p>

<p>Those who fail to understand the masses will continue to feel aggravated by them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I put some weight to that line of thought, keep us quarantined away from the masses. I also think they see this subs growth and its like a town forum. It unites many thinkers, people questioning. I try to put myself in their point of view, would it be more effective to just ban hammer this sub and any other place  where conspiracy theorists, free thinkers gather or leave us alone. I come to the conclusion that while there are downsides to banning us and having us spread around other subreddits, a la the fat people hate fiasco. This forum is more dangerous whole and interacting with each other, its a rallying point basically. Ban it and there is not many other places on the net as well organized, moderated. It would have to start from scratch as a sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>reddit is the 4th most visited website in the us and makes about $20 million/year. by comparison, facebook is the 3rd most visited website and makes <strong>$26 billion</strong>. the reason reddit is still alive (and why they&#39;ve closed-source their code recently) is because</p>

<ol>
<li><p>its a great away for the <em>rulers</em> to control narratives in the internet sphere</p></li>
<li><p>discussion dynamics are very flexible, giving moderators/dictators/CIA agents/whoever else is sitting on the other side the ability to throttle dissenting views, make them appear to look bad, and censorship. reddit is well known by know for its censorship culture. gimics like the voting system means that unpopular opinions are not seen by large groups of people, shadow banning prevents accounts from posting on certain subs. etc.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.   People are finally starting to believe the 100% hoax theory too.  Slowly but surely.  People should always look the hardest where the MSM and elites try to censor.  That is the the Las Vegas hoax YouTube videos that google changed their algorithms because people realized immediately that it was all bullshit. So what did they do. They flooded google and YouTube with only mainstream sources to bury the good hoax videos.   Then in the conspiracy community they launched the two shooter theory to distract everyone to go down a false trail.  People recognize this pattern from all the other “shootings”. Then they came out with the usual “he could be isis”.  This time they also came up with “he’s a gun dealer”!  Anything but “it’s all a hoax”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you mean.  Watching people in interviews where you can instinctively tell that they are lying or acting but you can’t pinpoint what it is.  If you’ve ever seen a real person in pain or sorrow you can use that experience and match it against these “witnesses” and see there is no truth to their stories.  Their bodies physiological reactions along with the way they speak about the events that happened right in front of them give them away.  There’s no red puffy eyes.  No sudden uncontrollable crying, no signs of just being in shock.  All just actors who seem to be describing a scene that they memorized over the last few days. Who could spit out a chunk of their story but fumble over elements that a real witness wouldn’t.  Nothing but crocodile tears and unusually witty stories about the recently deceased.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, and if the &#39;bodies&#39; vid is supposed to be real, then where are the crying people then, especially since they turn out the lights in the end. If my friend or my SO were dead on the ground you couldn&#39;t pull me away or fucking hear from me screaming over their body. Also, if my buddy got shot in the fucking chest, do you really think that I&#39;m going to give 2-3 interviews and then be like &#39;oh, i just got a text that he came out of surgery and is fine&#39;. I&#39;ve seen, felt, experienced fear, trauma, loss. Those people have not.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve also got the lack of visible wounds, even on the dude who got shot in the head but survived. It just makes me angry. It was a harsh awakening for me. I thought that the &#39;system&#39; was flawed, sure, but that our votes mattered and there were a lot of good people. Now? I dunno. Why did they lie? It made me go back and look at other hoaxes that I brushed off as just conspiracy &#39;nonsense&#39; like Sandy Hook. Doesn&#39;t take much looking to see that the acting is just as bad. </p>

<p>Just my take on it and I could just be a big, uncaring asshole like many have said. :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No your not a big uncaring asshole.  You are ABSOLUTELY right about the no crying family members in the liveleak video!  I noticed it too.  It was just a bunch of people squatting down around them with no one in shock, crying, or freaking out like normal people would be.  They all just nonchalantly said “oh, he’s got a gunshot in the head” and there were 0 actual human reactions.  They are all paid actors.  I work around people dealing with sudden death or injuries and NO ONE would act the way these people did in interviews. The guy with the “buddy” with three center chest wounds would have a “ buddy” that bled out before he got to the hospital.  Funny enough his “buddy” got discharged from the hospital 3 days later!!  Yeah fucking right.  Pulse shooting looking at the last names of lube, and colon and you can tell that they are laughing at us for believing this shit.  They love it.   American Horror Story has a shooting in front of a stage the SAME week as the shooting.  What a fucking coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe.. I mean, in looking at past pics of the Boston bombing thing and the Sandy Hook interviews, I&#39;m pissed at myself for not paying more attention back then. Maybe, to people who went through this back then, this IS just as obvious and nothing new. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still chewing on this part a bit. I&#39;ve even thought that maybe some non-actors made it in. Like, would they buy out the whole concert since it was slow night / last day of festival or would they use part actors to get non-actors to run off first.. Part of me thinks that if they were going to do this, they wouldn&#39;t have risked anything and all would&#39;ve been meant to be actors. From the pics, I don&#39;t think it was 22000 people either when you compare to other pics online of crowd sizes...</p>

<p>Anyways, was the hoax even intentionally sabotaged a bit, especially by the &#39;Are you good, my brother?&#39; guy who didn&#39;t stick around after the guy asked him who he was. </p>

<p>I feel like something&#39;s coming soon and will explain it, but, again, could just be naive and hoping that the world should make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it could be either/or when it comes to it all 20,000 people were actors. I didn’t ever really think about the crowd size being lied about but now that you said it I see what your saying.  It makes my mind go to their biggest false flag to be honest 9/11.  I know the whole thing was a false flag but what if they did the same tricks there.   I don’t necessarily think something big is coming because I felt like everyone would figure it out the last few shootings and no one did.  This ones already being forgotten.  You could be right though that they are making more and more “mistakes” like they want people to figure it out.  It scares me what would happen if everyone did find out.  I think people are so complacent and comfortable that they wouldn’t want to do anything crazy and I don’t blame them.  I don’t want our country to collapse in on its self.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like 22,000 was size of hockey arena, one crowd thing said, and I&#39;ve looked at several pics. Just guessing, and would really welcome someone more expert, but the panning shots, I&#39;m thinking 5k and max maybe 10k, but thats just me going off of internet data and not very scientifically.</p>

<p>The thing is, you CANT just tell the whole US and world that &quot;Haha, guys. We&#39;ve TOTALLY been lying to you for awhile on all these things.&quot; I mean, I&#39;ve dabbled and been light conspiracy over years, as in I would entertain the thought but not research and would still just go with the MSM. 9/11, I watched the news in horror that morning and was shocked with the rest of the world. Over the years, it was like &#39;Man. These people are jerks.&#39; and then eventually, I watched a bit more, looked a bit more and watched that study on building 7 and was like.. wow. I just freaking realized that the whole damned thing is most likely false flag and is part of the reason the Vegas hoax / awakening affected me so bad. I BELIEVED what I was told. I bought into it and was deceived by my govt for years. I thought it was corrupt, but that we had a chance to change and that maybe one day, people could unite and make shit better. Just, I&#39;m more self-aware than most IRL people that I know, and realizing that the system is a lie and a farce really fucked with me. When the reality that you&#39;ve bought into and put passion/emotions into for years get squished, it hurts a bit. I did not have an anchor and it was scary. Now, it seems dumb that I was so affected, but I&#39;ve read that is not uncommon for such a big disillusionment. So, yeah, if you have others that feel so strongly but in masses, I think that it would be a bit chaotic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, its just MY take on it and I could be wrong, but yeah, hoax. No one died. I believe that its possible that the police even thought it was an active shooter drill like they did in August 2016. (Look at the victims in it. Looks like the &#39;blood&#39; in that random liveleak one which was very fake.) </p>

<p>Maybe, I&#39;d just rather believe that they were misled, and didn&#39;t mean to be part of the hoax that the FBI, etc pushed them into. </p>

<p>The vids that were out the day after, well none showed anyone get trampled or shot. You had the vid where the cowboy was like its not real and then they panned out over the crowd which was just walking away and no one on the ground at that point. The pics of the dead guy were one of my first clues since I was geared up and afraid to look, expecting a death scene and it was just horribly fake with a bunch of shit wrong with it. Again, thats also one of the reasons why I keep thinking that the LVMPD was expecting a drill/training, since it was obviously &#39;staged&#39;. In those, they don&#39;t care to be super realistic and TRICK the public, they just have to be somewhat realistic so that their officers are training.</p>

<p>There is a lot more too, but I gave up on posting. I kept track for awhile of all of the videos/photos that were showing up everywhere, and even followed up on one of the obits where google map got screwy in their hometown. Their local message boards were empty of anything of them on that day, etc. There was like 1 post of so and so died! and a &#39;I heard about that&#39;. I&#39;m sure there are more now, but the forum was all active on other local events and if they were the hero of their small town, there would be a lot more concern. Whatever, though. I&#39;ve went through my stages of realization and it was a hard thing to come to grips with that the public was intentionally deceived and that the system is a sham. </p>

<p>TLDR: I truly believe that no one died.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. I did more research because I was distraught and confused. Maybe I&#39;ll try to find the vids that I downloaded before they were removed. Someone might&#39;ve reuploaded by now, but I gave up on a lot of it since no one was listening. Just I know that many were removed from youtube pretty quickly. </p>

<p>I also thought there were 2 shooters at first, but when the cabbie moved her camera at &#39;just&#39; the time the bullets paused and then there were a couple other vids proving it was a strobe during the shooting, I was really confused. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if that staged pic was Paddock, but that pic was fake, whoever it was. I&#39;ve already torn it apart as have others. Specifically, though, blood color/consistency is wrong, spatter is wrong, gun wrong spot, casings are wrong in number and location. If he shot himself in head there is no brain matter in the pic to prove it. You can find links of real gunshot wounds and those make you feel sick (or did me). Did he supposedly shoot himself in mouth (or just bleed out his mouth for some reason?) If so, there should be distortion or whatever around the mouth, tears and such. </p>

<p>They keep changing the narrative because they want you distracted and to keep chasing that &#39;OMG, PEOPLE DIED&#39;. Maybe it is just a gun control thing. I&#39;m not really sure why the insistence that deaths occurred. I try to be open that people died, but I just can&#39;t buy it. If anyone died, I don&#39;t think that they are anyone in the official list.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it is definitely staged. </p>

<p>Where are their entry / exit wounds? Those people aren&#39;t medics. If it was as the reporters say and ambulances were to and fro, there would be true medical there. If you match up time stamps to when police came then and said &#39;We have blabla in medical tent&#39; which is near the beginning, again, you&#39;d have real medical on scene. That vid is very unconvincing. Watch active shooter drills on youtube. Fake blood with just little staging and people not really trying to act. It&#39;s not real. Did any news or police even ever vouch that this vid was taken at the concert? Perhaps, its fake news intended to make it look like a hoax... Then again, the other vids and interviews still go along with that as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some odd shit goes on around here. The other day I saw a reply in a comment chain that had been masked with a link saying something about &quot;this comment has been marked as sensitive, click to show&quot;. Like what the fuck is that? I didn&#39;t have the presence of mind to screenshot it before I clicked, and it was soon lost (it was a busy thread, I think in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> or <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>). I haven&#39;t seen another yet, but I&#39;m watching for it.</p>

<p>Awhile back reddit started opting people back in to the outbound link tracking. I was vocal about that for awhile. It&#39;s in your preferences, and check under the &quot;personalization preferences&quot; for more stuff to opt out of. Just don&#39;t trust that it will stay that way permanently. About all we can do is make more people aware of this stuff, so you&#39;re doing the right thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skepticism, since you don&#39;t seem to know what that is, is a refusal to believe either a stated case or any specific one that contradicts it, either, due to a lack of enough supporting evidence to convince you either way due to a false assumption that there are only two possibilities which are being presented and pressing their case on that simplistic basis and insisting that one of them must be right if the other can simply be proved to be wrong. </p>

<p>To be a skeptic is to withhold judgement and know that it&#39;s better to live with the uncertainty than accept either on that kind of a basis.</p>

<p>There are always more potential possibilities, one of which is that both are completely wrong and that the real answer is to be found elsewhere and if the issue is important enough to further investigate those possibilities in addition to what&#39;s been postulated.</p>

<p>Anything you can&#39;t prove by your own most direct experience doesn&#39;t demand that you should or somehow need &quot;to believe it&quot;.</p>

<p>In fact &quot;belief&quot; is contrary to the very nature of any true scientific and intellectual investigation or understanding. A true skeptic recognises that a certain perspective can be useful in some cases but not others. It doesn&#39;t require  any &quot;faith&quot; or undying beliefs to pragmatically use that perspective or any of the information derived from it strictly for practical purposes or infer any additional meaning to simply because it&#39;s workable or good enough for that.</p>

<p>You have perhaps heard of the &quot;unified field theory&quot; that has yet to be discovered. The Holy Grail of science.</p>

<p>That is because what is known and accepted as being correct in the individual fields of physics, chemistry, and mathematics nevertheless have unresolved discrepancies and conflicts that exist between them. </p>

<p>Something of major significance that goes to the fundamental understanding of each of them that wouldn&#39;t exist if any of them was completely correct in every way. While individually they appear to be in their own domains and pure applications certain chemical reactions cannot be explained from a purely physics point of view because they conflict with it says they should be but aren&#39;t and certain phenomena in physics can&#39;t be explained in purely mathematical terms because they conflict with what a proper mathematical description describes what they should be.</p>

<p>Do I really need to believe that the Earth is round or flat if I can&#39;t get far enough away from it to verify which it is and quite frankly their are discrepancies in both points of view that quite simply shouldn&#39;t be there that necessitate all kinds of other assumptions that can&#39;t actually be proven, either?</p>

<p>If anything all my everyday experience of it is actually that it&#39;s a flat stationary plane. The Sun is still said by one and all &quot;to rise&quot; and &quot;set&quot;, while it is assumed that it&#39;s the Earth rolling and rising and not the other way around. You&#39;d think someone would have gotten around to correcting that by now, wouldn&#39;t you? Or maybe it&#39;s just not all that important.</p>

<p>That’s just it, and why there is so much opposition to questioning the narrative.  People are uncomfortable with what they don’t <em>know</em>, and they will defend what is <em>known</em> as if their life depends on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By very definition, skepticism is to doubt some form of knowledge or belief. That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have beliefs, though if you are skeptical about literally everything then it stands that you are also skeptical about those beliefs. However there isn&#39;t some law that says all skeptics must have no beliefs. See it as something you can dip in and out of. Nihilism on the other hand is a belief that there is no such thing as objective (transcendent) meaning to life. That is to say all meaning is arbitrary. A skeptic might or might not become a nihilist depending on what data they are exposed to but skepticism and nihilism have very little to do with each other.</p>

<p>To be skeptical of a subject is healthy, but to be skeptical of everything is counter-productive and unrealistic. No human truly thinks like that. Skepticism itself is just another ideology; a conscious belief that there is a lack of evidence to convince you of a specific belief. You cannot escape the human need for a belief system.</p>

<p>The two worked on an immigration policy debate at Duke. But, Spencer wrote, “After we left Duke, we drifted apart. The last time we spoke was, I think, around 2009. We were friends, but we haven’t been in communication for some time.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of those articles claim that Hillary or Obama was bribed. </p>

<p>They do all have dishonest article titles when we have been told that the FBI didn&#39;t inform the people who reviewed and approved the sale, the articles are written to direct you to think so. </p>

<p>Example: NYPost title says:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama administration knew about Russian bribery plot before uranium deal. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then their article says this:  </p>

<p>*_ _ _but multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever told other committee members about the crimes they had uncovered.</p>

<p>Newsweek title:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>FBI Kept Russian Bribery Plot Under Wraps Before Obama Administration Approved Nuclear Deal With Moscow</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Independent title: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama administration approved nuclear deal with Kremlin after FBI uncovered Russian bribery plot  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Undermined by their first sentence:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Obama administration <strong>potentially</strong> knew of corruption at a Russian nuclear supplier years before it agreed to sign over 20 per cent of US&#39;s uranium supply to the company, a new report has claimed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m pretty new to reddit but from what I understand, subreddits are independently maintained and mods can ban you for literally no reason, just because they don&#39;t like you. be likable and you probably won&#39;t get banned.</p>

That is, they are <em>the</em> &quot;city&quot; with the most visits. </p>

<p>Then notice <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/eglin-air-force-base-busted-gaming-reddit.html">this article</a>, an excerpt: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.5644.pdf">Here is a paper funded by Eglin AFB</a> studying how to establish majority views, social control, influence conversations, contain unwanted information. Eglin AFB is a major hub for Pentagon domestic manipulation programs online. </p>

<p>it&#39;s hard to get more direct evidence than that really. it&#39;s not just about left or right politics being swayed, if the american military is involved in covering up and controlling the narratives on an entire site as big as reddit, there is much more going on here</p>

<p>There is proof from multiple sources that confirm 100% that Russia is helping fund the DNC to stay in power... both the Russians and the DNC. The implication is that the news works for the Deep State and the DNC and most of the RNC is propped up by the Deep State.

<p>I&#39;m sure you can understand how your statement was misconstrued. You insinuated that TheHill is mentioned in the rules, but its not; meanwhile Rule 3 actually states posts will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Editing your OP might help separate fact from speculation.</p>

<p>There is proof from multiple sources that confirm 100% that Russia is helping fund the DNC to stay in power... both the Russians and the DNC. The implication is that the news works for the Deep State and the DNC and most of the RNC is propped up by the Deep State. If this was not true, then the control over the mass media would not be as strong. The intelligence community controls both political parties and the news.
The common thread is that the news does two things... pushes for creeping authoritarianism and never reveals what the intelligence community is up to. <a href="https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=8a5bd4fb-2687-4cdf-9906-0a65f4d8d52b&amp;amp;filingTypeID=1">https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=8a5bd4fb-2687-4cdf-9906-0a65f4d8d52b&amp;amp;filingTypeID=1</a>
That is proof John Podesta works for Russia. It is an LD 1 disclosure form. Podesta also received 100,000 shares from Joule, over 4 years. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635</a> (Here is Podesta&#39;s tax attorney: <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/professionals-John_Cobb.html">http://www.steptoe.com/professionals-John_Cobb.html</a>) <a href="http://joule-unlimited.com/about/board">http://joule-unlimited.com/about/board</a>
That is the board at Joule. All Russian CEOs, including Sberbank, Troika Dialog, Rusnano and Rosatom. They all worked together to make the Uranium One deal happen. But, it gets worse. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eO8ZHfV4fk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eO8ZHfV4fk</a>
Chaika is exposed in this documentary that is banned in Russia. Yuri Chaika was in put in power by Medvedev, but he indicates to an intelligence analyst that Sergei Ivanov is calling the shots.
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/54/5410884_re-insight-russia-head-of-major-criminal-group-arrested.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/54/5410884_re-insight-russia-head-of-major-criminal-group-arrested.html</a>
Chaika said he has already been under a lot of heat because of the Politkovskaya arrests. He said that he would rather not tell me about the &quot;Chechen mastermind&quot; they arrested. I asked if this was because he was not really a mastermind and Chaika said that &quot;many things needed to be tied up as we head into this election and the end of Putin&#39;s reign.&quot; [I know this is strange, but he kept saying things like, &quot;Ivanov needs to have control over the situation he&#39;s about to enter into.... Ivanov is known for his distance from such situations, so they need to be wrapped up.&quot;]
What is crazy, is that even organized crime won&#39;t go near energy assets, which is a playground that Podesta, Hillary and the DNC have no problem playing in. That is a really interesting point... that they scare the Russian mob. Either way, these people at the top of Russian politics are very often cooperating with our own intelligence assets. Here is a list: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OVvquE_0SIXo1NLgJmFr7gjUbDFNjUG2YzdHZxPFyzU/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OVvquE_0SIXo1NLgJmFr7gjUbDFNjUG2YzdHZxPFyzU/edit?usp=sharing</a>
During the course of the Uranium One scandal, Gazprom was also acquiring extraction rights and expanding with more locations and resources. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/55/5500400_re-t-weekly-next-week-.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/55/5500400_re-t-weekly-next-week-.html</a> the company builds pipelines around the world and Gazprom wanted the the company, so the owner of the company ended up with his shoulders broken and stuffed into a pipeline. Then they turned on the nat gas and he suffocated while his limbs flew off in the 50 mph nat gas flow.....
The Russians seem pretty great at compartmentalizing, but all these paths seem to course through Dmitry Medvedev.
I am confident that a decent group of investigators can tie all this up, now that the Chaika scandal has been exposed. It is just a matter of tracing the web.
Meanwhile, the news in the US doesn&#39;t actually educate people on how Russian corruption works because that would elucidate ties to our own government.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay, sure.  Assuming we get some new, different, more concrete facts, of course it can be blown out of the water, and anyone with those facts should present them, rather than allude to their existence.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those being, Obama is not the president   </p>

<p>But he was.  Obviously this isn&#39;t a current event if we&#39;re talking about the past.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hillary isn&#39;t either   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but this doesn&#39;t change the fact that she did everything in her power to try and become president.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the Democrats lost the last election.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the exact same as your previous question, but being presented as a separate point for some reason.  See above.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So they&#39;ve done and awful job of holding onto power.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  And when they saw they were losing their power, they called upon their allies to help them keep it.  The american people didn&#39;t like that.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me guess though, that&#39;s all part of the misinformation campaign, right?   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whats all part of the misinformation?  What did you think you proved by stating the result?   However, the positive press coverage and media manipulation that occured in clintons favor could absolutely be argued as part of the misinformation, but luckily that didn&#39;t work.  As stupid as people are, we can usually do two thing well.  Track with our eyes, and detect bullshit when we hear it.   </p>

As a necessity even?  </p>

<p>Nope.  Removing corruption should be our #1 priority.  If our captain is compromised, so is the rest of the ship.<br/>
If preventing corruption isn&#39;t your #1 priority, then well, we all understand your motivations just a little bit better.   </p>

<p>Good, Good, Good.  I appreciate people like you who aren&#39;t decayed by bullshit because you&#39;re decent at detecting it.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And forgive me, but you Americans seem awfully concerned with Hillary Clinton and Obama   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As an american, I am absolutely concerned with how former leaders partook in corruption.  Especially the ones who have been &#39;media darlings&#39; for the past 10 years.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>while you have an actual lunatic at the helm fucking your country up.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok then, well as an american, He&#39;s definitely not fucking the country up.  Sorry if you&#39;re hearing otherwise but he&#39;s definitely doing exactly what he claimed he&#39;d do when he was running.    Disagreeing with his platform doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t doing a good job at what he said he would.   </p>

<p>And dude, come on, are you really just not even trying?  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>So you were suggesting that misinformation was a necessity to intelligence communities, due to the fact that intelligence communities are secretive by design?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And anyone who expects to be told actual facts about the goings on within said community is being very naive. I don&#39;t like it, but it&#39;s the way it is.  </p>

<p>Yes, but buying into it and perpetuating lies makes you complicit.  </p>

<p>Just ask why this article, from this topic from 2015, regarding collusion with russia, didn&#39;t come into our public view until 2017.<br/>
If this mentioned trump, he literally would have been impeached.<br/>
I get that you don&#39;t understand american laws and how we feel about cheaters and patriotism in general, but we love our country and don&#39;t like people using it for their own personal gain.  Clinton seems to have done just that, with more concrete information than what has been suggested against trump in the past year.   </p>

<p>Feel free to take it as crazy if you want, but at the very least you should try and think from the perspective of an american, as thats the group of people being effected here.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh this is going to be fun.  Online quiz.<br/>
I&#39;ll be honest with the answers as long as you promise to assess it without looking for a &#39;gotcha&#39; moment.  Thats fair right?<br/>
Lets play...   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are supportive of a president who have, as yet, been caught lying or exaggerating more then 1300 times. Do you question this?   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I support the guy that won the election last november for president as president, yes.<br/>
I&#39;m also going to continue to support him until he loses an election, or leaves office and another guy (or girl) wins.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has openly admitted to harass women while married. Do you question this?   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He flaunts his wealth, yet calls himself a good Christian. Do you question this?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No?  Nor, as a christian, do i have any problem with him being wealthy.  I&#39;d say most american families strive to have trumps wealth, Do you question this?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He meets insults with insults instead of turning the other cheek. Do you question this?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, and I think its great.  Why should you stand there while someone insults you?    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is remarried with a trophy wife many years younger than him. Do you question this?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, yes.  Thats a pretty insulting thing to say of melania.  Is she not capable of making her own decisions and thinking for herself?<br/>
Like, what are we even gaining out of questioning this?  Whether or not he&#39;s sexually appealing?  You really care about that as a presidential quality?  </p>

<p>And besides, you get trophies for &#39;winning&#39;, do you question this?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has put his own children into office. Do you question this?   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope.  Its not like he hid it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has dodged the draft yet called war veterans cowards for getting caught. Do you question this?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I question this one. But i&#39;ll happily take a source on it and check it out.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has shown a habit of walking in to other peoples teenage daughters while they were naked. Do you question this?   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The habit i question, yes, but the overall point, no not at all.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You seem like a proud and forthright man. Is this honestly a man that lives up to your standards for a president?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all.  Yet i&#39;m proud and forthright to call him my president.<br/>
Seriously, the other options were that much worse..</p>

<p>The mods look at your other-sub posts and ban based on their individual preferences.</p>

<p>There is no law. It&#39;s a bunch of child-like SJWs (probably living off disability check for mental illness given their frequency and time on reddit, along with their emotive stances).</p>

<p>If they see you with a T_D, and personally dont like it, they ban you.</p>

<p>I have &#39;askmen&#39;, and after talking to some cunt who hates men, I get banned for what I can only assume is affiliation - because the argument are philosophically sound (it&#39;s completely my own, it&#39;s learned from philosophical authorities - like she assumes her &#39;CRIS&#39; professor was).</p>

<p>It&#39;s people being juvenile people. </p>

<p>That or shill brigades.</p>

<p>The only solution is the same. Have them removed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe.. I mean, in looking at past pics of the Boston bombing thing and the Sandy Hook interviews, I&#39;m pissed at myself for not paying more attention back then. Maybe, to people who went through this back then, this IS just as obvious and nothing new. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still chewing on this part a bit. I&#39;ve even thought that maybe some non-actors made it in. Like, would they buy out the whole concert since it was slow night / last day of festival or would they use part actors to get non-actors to run off first.. Part of me thinks that if they were going to do this, they wouldn&#39;t have risked anything and all would&#39;ve been meant to be actors. From the pics, I don&#39;t think it was 22000 people either when you compare to other pics online of crowd sizes...</p>

<p>Anyways, was the hoax even intentionally sabotaged a bit, especially by the &#39;Are you good, my brother?&#39; guy who didn&#39;t stick around after the guy asked him who he was. </p>

<p>I feel like something&#39;s coming soon and will explain it, but, again, could just be naive and hoping that the world should make sense.</p>
