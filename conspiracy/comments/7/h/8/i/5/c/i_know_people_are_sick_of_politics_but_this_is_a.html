        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Timing.  This is a perfect example of media mind control attempts.  It doesn’t really matter whether you like or hate the guy, this should anger you.</p>

<p>Ok, Russia is losing traction and TPTB need a new line of attack...  well what time is it?  Oh!  The holidays!  Where soon we will be seeing family and there is a likelihood that many people will spend time with some relative who has dementia!</p>

<p>What better time to circulate a rumor that implants “Trump has dementia” then now to make a calculated bet that it will subconsciously pop up when you see an elderly relative with dementia and they hope the confirmation bias will set in.</p>

<p>Timing is everything, right?</p>

<p>Edit:  The greater point here is not to argue whether he may or may not have it, the point is the media suddenly putting out this line in lockstep and the fact that it is a see-through attempt at a psychological primer based on the probability of seeing someone with dementia during the holidays.  That is why I said this is a bit different than just Trump/politics. It is a clear example of media “mind control” tactics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno, he is a practiced speaker, but mostly speaks without a script.  Have you ever taken public speaking?  I am pretty good at it (well I have to do it a bunch and don’t get nervous anyway) and I daze out or forget words and such...  it is pretty normal.</p>

<p>TBH, I have seen more that would suggest ADHD or just having a lot on your mind than dementia.  (Disclaimer:  I have adult ADHD and before finally getting diagnosed had many of those behaviors like thinking about things to the extent of literally not seeing or hearing the person speaking to me, forgetting random things, etc.  point is it could be confirmation bias on my part.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, it isn’t beyond the realm of possibility.  But, most of those things are not obviously dementia.  I mentioned it on another comment, and also admitted that since I have it my view may be biased, but it seems more like if anything ADHD than dementia.  The Bibi thing?  I can’t count the number of times someone said something that made me start thinking and just totally daze out into my own head, little things like the hand and the wife...  having a lot going on in your brain makes just as much sense.</p>

<p>I have had relatives with dementia and known a few older folks unrelated that had/have it.  Those are not really he behaviors that I have seen, and being able to speak off script as well as he does is not really in the realm of possibility for it.  Uncontrolled and inappropriate emotions, repeating a statement or question (non-rhetorically) out of time, confusion in general are the signs.</p>

<p>When you see some of those videos you have to realize it is all very choreographed and such, have you ever posed for wedding pictures?  You know how the photog says “look left” and there is confusion as people go the wrong way and such?  Yeah, that kind of stuff for the state visit photo ops but also with other people trying to simultaneously direct in another language or two...</p>

Anyone that has read real info or listened to actual KGB spies would realize it is all about appearance and deceit, not actual hands-on subterfuge.</p>

<p>Just like when the Cold War ended and we realized just how much of a joke the Soviet arsenal was or how North Korea puts on fake shows of wealth for visitors.  It is all about appearance and perception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the media picks their moments to spotlight things. On the other hand, he just made several tweets and some speeches that definitely point to something being more wrong with his mental processing.  Tweeting to the wrong Teresa May, and the way he kept free associating during the speech at the tree lighting for instance. He&#39;s always been prone to go off script, but it&#39;s getting worse. </p>

<p>No matter what side of the political spectrum you&#39;re on, if you&#39;ve watched a relative deteriorate with dementia or alzheimer&#39;s, you probably recognize some of the signs in him. I never liked him, even before his political career, but this is just making me sadfor him on a personal level. His family should encourage him to step down instead of leaving him to flounder in front of the whole world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the recent media focus has more to do with the fact that Trump is becoming more and more unhinged by the week. And he is starting to forget which lies he&#39;s told, to whom. It&#39;s only a matter of time before he does something to deflect the unwanted attention. He&#39;s going to start a war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad you do.  </p>

<p>The divisiveness and echo chambers really are working to control the population.  It is honestly scary and depressing.</p>

<p>Demoralization, whatever, so many people here can’t see the forest through the trees; it doesn’t matter what you think about Trump, the issue here is more coordinated propaganda from the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh, I don’t have that hero worship shit going on.  Better than the alternative, how can I tell?  Because every single arm of the military/marketing/media/political/industrial complex is trying to take him out.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if it were Trump or anyone else, I am pointing out an example of how the media tries to implant ideas in your head and why they are shooting for that idea at this time.</p>

<p>Critical thinking and skepticism.</p>
