<p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>Some of you may have read my posts here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in the past, for anyone who knows me or have seen my posts (some were removed by the mods due to reddits rules) then you&#39;ll be well aware that I run a blog that exposes VIPs who work in government and entertainment or high profile cases that are involved in paedophilia.</p>

<p>I posted 11 days ago to tell you all about Jon Venables a man who at the age of 10 killed, raped and murdered a 2-year-old boy, he mutiltaed him, poored paint into his eyes, threw rocks at his head, sexually assaulted him and stuck batteries in the two year olds anus and mouth.</p>

<p>He was released from prison as an adult in 2002 but given a new identity for the rest of his life. Twice now he has been recalled to prison for downloading and distributing images of children as young as two, the courts keep letting him go free and live in society where he poses a serious risk to the general public and children.</p>

<p>I exposed his identity and as such will be arrested, people were skeptical last time I said this but the press have issues <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/dec/04/inquiry-social-media-messages-identify-jon-venables">this today</a> the Guardian describe my website here perfectly.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://www.freeandfearless.org.uk/">My website</a></strong> was the first website to show on Google search for jon venables new identity, it got that many hits my servers crashed.</p></li>
<li><p>I specifically mentioned in my article that I knew what I was doing was illegal but I needed to do something to try and ensure this sick pervert wasn&#39;t released onto our streets again.</p></li>
<li><p>My website also exposed Maxine Carr.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The guardian article explains my website perfectly without naming it directly.</p>

<p>In short guys I&#39;m due to be prosecuted and could face two years in prison for trying to expose paedos and keep the general public safe.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s anyone out there who can help me please let me know, I&#39;m scared but eager to do the right thing.</p>

<p>Please keep me in your thoughts, I do not trust the government, they have already blocked my website via alot of UK ISP&#39;s. I have also exposed a lot of MPs in the UK for child abuse and paedophilia.</p>

<p>If this account goes dark, please do something, act, share my story and case, I don&#39;t want my work to be for nothing.</p>

<p>Any and all help and advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Forgot to add I started my website as I was abused as a young boy, you can <a href="https://www.freeandfearless.org.uk/im-going-covering-child-abuse-cases/">read more here</a>.</p>

<p>After I started the site a month or so later mail to my house started going missing, credit cards, government letters, bank letters, all mail I knew I should be getting but didn&#39;t turn up. Some mail also seemed to be tampered with.</p>

<p>I also made <a href="https://d.tube/#!/v/freeandfearless/hwqou7yp">this video</a> about Prince Phillip and his links to Epstein. I shortly recieved a notice from YouTube saying they had a legal complaint and would be removing the video for bullying and harassment.</p>

<p>Shortly after that I started to get emails from readers in the UK saying that my website kept saying it was blocked by their ISP.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;ve rustled some feathers as I post a lot about politicans who I have outed as paedophiles as well as some celebrities. I always knew I&#39;d possibly face legal action one day, that&#39;s not what scares me, what I&#39;m worried about is because of the abuse I suffered as a young lad, I suffer from depression and have self harmed in the past (not anymore) I am also on anti-depressants, so it&#39;s all too easy for the authorities to make it look like I killed myself.</p>

<p>I know that sounds over paranoid but everything is coming together, I hope I&#39;m wrong. </p>

<p>Just let me go on record now and say I&#39;m NOT suicidal in anyway shape or form and would not kill myself.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>Thank you kind stranger for the gold.</p>

<p>05/12/2017 08:31am - I&#39;m safe and sound at the minute, it&#39;s hitting the news and all mainstream media in the UK about the story, considering a few things but limited to what I can say at this point, thank you to all you lovely people for the help and support.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong></p>

<p>I have removed the GoFundMe page because there&#39;s some armchair detectives who are trying to discredit the work I&#39;m doing by bringing up the fact I advertsie web design and digital marketing work on my own personal website, which may I add is very inactive. I&#39;ve designed 2 websites this year each for £100. Not sure how this discredits the work that I do but as I feard I don&#39;t want to make Free &amp; Fearless about the money, it has never been about that.</p>

<p>If/When I&#39;m arrested thanks to the help from Redditors today, I have found out that I will likely recieve free legal support due to my health and not working.</p>

<p>Anybody who does wish to give financial support can do so by my <a href="https://www.freeandfearless.org.uk/donate/">website donation page here</a>. Please though don&#39;t feel obliged and note this is not for legal fees, it&#39;s for those wishing to support the work Free &amp; Fearless does. One of my aims is to get the website located on a server that the government can&#39;t access, offshore, if anyone can support me with this please do get in touch.</p>

<p>Please if you&#39;re going to give, give because you support the work I do on the website and the website in general.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for all your help and support, I couldn&#39;t ask for more, people are really getting this out there by sharing it, I chose <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because you guys have always been amazing. Honestly I am overwhelmed by the support from you guys, thanks to each and everyone of you.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 4</strong></p>

<p>Have to go dark, not been arrested yet but things are starting to kick off, this has put a huge strain on my relationship, had to come of FaceBook and everything, I will try and post back here when it&#39;s safe to do so and let people know what&#39;s going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes they are good lawyers who just need to get their name out there. They are usually less experienced but doing a good job will help them get hired for bigger cases so they will try. I would bet on something the deep state wants to go their way tho they send a lawyer on their payroll</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A public defender isn&#39;t going to do a ton of extra work and research for you unless you hire them privately, but the advantage of having one is that they are almost always super familiar with the judge, the prosecutors, etc. if you live in a small town this can be a blessing, trust me. </p>

<p>So yes, 99% of the time they will try to get you to just take a plea deal and be done with it so they can get their $198 or whatever it is the government pays them per case, but there are some who really do fight for people, and the bonus is that they can give you honest advice on how they think a judge will rule based on their past experience with him/her, and also they trade cases with the DA&#39;s. They all sit together in chambers and review the cases before court starts, so the whole actual court appearance is really just for show. But I know for a fact that occasionally they&#39;ll ask the DA to cut them a break on one case and offer up a loss on another case. I can&#39;t imagine this is legal, but in small towns these people work together all day, it&#39;s not like in the movies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah I have to say, even in situations where your getting a plea deal no matter what, a lot of times a private town lawyer will have the same connections and fight harder for you.</p>

<p>whereas the PD will make a case for you and get you something less than max charge, a private lawyer could potentially really fight for an even further reduced charge</p>

<p>I feel that if I set up a gofundme or anything like that and advertise that it will take away some credit for what I&#39;m doing and make it more about making money as opposed to stopping dirty scumbag paedophiles and child abusers.</p>

<p>Truth be told I&#39;ve not received one donation on my website to date, I was even considering removing the donation sections because of that fact, I fund the website out of my own back pocket and out of a passion for the cause.</p>

<p>I could definitely use some help moving the site to an offshore server though, I think that&#39;s the next step for them to get my web host to take it offline. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. If they do arrest you, start a legal fund. You&#39;ll have more supporters than you can imagine once the real story gets out. The people are sick of this shit--hurting children--and it being covered up by people in power. Think of it as allowing you to fight the good fight, not asking people for money. The kids need you, and so does the rest of society. You&#39;re using your voice to wake people up to the reality of rampant pedophilia. This is a very important work.</p>

<p>Hey, I went to donate, but then got a little uncomfortable just popping my credit card in a random site.  I assume I am not the only one.  You may be able to get more donations if you setup something with a reputable site.  I know it sucks they take a cut, but if people are more comfortable they may be more likely to donate.  Go create a gofundme, paypal or something.  This seems to be getting a bit of traction and you may be able to help fund your defense.  Go create something on a site known site and I will be the first to done. :)</p>

<p>Good luck man!</p>

<p>TRUMP HAD DONE NOTHING AT ALL TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET PEDOPHILES.   NOTHING.  ALL HE HAS DONE IS TALK.  HE&#39;S BEEN IN OFFICE OVER A YEAR NOW AND STILL NOTHING AT ALL.

    <div class="md"><p>In no way did I defend paedophilia. I even called it sickening in another comment and recommended life in prison. What you&#39;re attacking is a straw man.</p>

<p>What OP is doing is NOT right. He&#39;s advocating and enabling extrajudicial justice - attack those who have broken the law. In that case, what law do you follow? If I think it&#39;s wrong to be muslim because being muslim hurts others, should I be allowed to kill muslims? (I don&#39;t think this).</p>

<p>If the law is the country is deemed obsolete by the country&#39;s inhabitants, the methods to change are via protest or public vote. Not outing them to advocate assault and murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I said he should have life in prison. Your argument has no basis.</p>

<p>The justice system isn&#39;t working, I agree. So campaign to parliament. Start a protest. Start a march. Make your beliefs known. But publishing their information IS illegal, and him being arrested for it isn&#39;t wrong, as he is putting citizens of the UK (no matter how heinous their crime) in danger. </p>

<p>Citizen journalism can be great. But it&#39;s not as reliable as actual journalism with sourced and reviewed arguments, and it&#39;s entirely possible that he releases information on innocent people, and ruins their lives. Is that something you&#39;re okay with?</p>

<p>How can they be after you through your ISP if you have your name on the site, or is that a false name on the articles, as the domain lookup provides the same name, along with an address.  They wouldn&#39;t need to go through your ISP to find you, you&#39;re pretty visible unless everything is fake.</p>

<p>Your site could be being blocked by ISP filters due to other hosted content, not just this article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>USA, Texas.  Getting caught with a sack of marijuana here will get you 180 days in jail and a class a misdemeanor.  I see people doing large time here (10 - 30 years) for small amounts (personal use) of illicit narcotics (cocaine, speed, heroin).  Imagine what they would do if you actually went against the government like in this sub.  The USA has millions of people incarcerated.  We are a police state in Texas.  The USA likes to put their young adults in jail because they are the most defenseless and usually have parents that will come with big pockets.  Like all else, it’s about the money and the privatized prisons that they must keep full.  The prisons get state and federal money for each inmate they are incarcerating.  It’s a vicious cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Publication of the images has alarmed officials, who fear they may be used to track down individuals who have been granted anonymity by the courts. Those publishing information seem to be aware in some cases that they are defying the law but persist nonetheless.</p>

<p>There is a concern that if the latest breaches are not pursued then the practice could spread to undermining the 1974 Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, under which certain offences no longer need to be disclosed after a set period. About 11 million people have some form of criminal record.</p>

<p>The attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, published a call for evidence earlier this year to assess the impact of social media on criminal cases and establish whether extra reporting restrictions are needed.</p>

<p>At the time, he said: “Our contempt of court laws are designed to prevent trial by media. However, are they able to protect against trials by social media? I am looking for expert evidence on whether the increasing influence and ubiquity of social media is having an impact on criminal trials and, if so, whether the criminal justice system has the tools it needs to manage that risk.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, any and all exposure helps.</p>

<p>I started all of this because I was abused as a kid and wanted to expose abusers but first my mail starts getting tampered with, weird stuff happening to our post at home, I wasn&#39;t 110% sure there was anything sinister to it though.</p>

<p>Then my website starts getting blocked, now this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 99.9% sure I&#39;m screwed. I&#39;m not worried about legal repercussions as I expected that, I&#39;m worried because I have a history of depression they&#39;ll bump me off and make it look like suicide.</p>

<p>I know that sounds over paranoid but I&#39;m on edge so many strange things have happened now this, it all adds up.</p>

<p>I made <a href="https://d.tube/#!/v/freeandfearless/hwqou7yp">a video</a> about Prince Phillip and his links to Epstein and the video was removed from YouTube with a message saying they had a legal complaint and had to take it down for bullying and harassment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that I&#39;ve rustled a few feathers, especially since I&#39;ve been exposing paedophile mps and politicians.</p>

<p>I also think the fact a video about a British royal family member was taken down indicates that he&#39;s most definitely caught the attention of the British security apparatus. OP will be made an example of unfortunately.</p>

<p>As for mail being tampered with etc this wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all, he should expand on this and document images / videos of what&#39;s going on. Set up security cams in the house.

<p>This is nuts to me. Maybe he just wanted other people to be aware of a potential risk to their children living within their midst. i do not understand this desire to protect criminals more than protecting INNOCENT CITIZENS. If this person hurts anyone then the government should be sued to hell and back. I don&#39;t know if the backwards system over there even allows you to sue the government but fuck me. </p>

<p>Side note, the court issued a &quot;worldwide injunction&quot; against anyone in the world posting his new name or photo. The idea they think they can enforce such a thing globally is adorable!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were released from custody, a court ruled that their identities should remain secret. <strong>The court granted an injunction which prevents the media or individuals from publishing images which claim to be of Venables and Thompson (whether or not it is them). The injunction is worldwide and applies equally to the internet, social media and mainstream media.</strong></p>

<p>A breach carries a sentence of up to two years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. The High Court Judges said the men knew what they were doing was wrong and it was no excuse that others were doing it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d probably want to know if my new neighbor was a sociopath who is being recalled to the courts regularly because they&#39;re still a sociopath.  If they want to protect Venables and everyone else, put him in a mental institution where he can get care.  </p>

<p>The images aren&#39;t a huge secret at all, when he was first released there was a false image of him being spread around, these however are the real deal.</p>

<p>One key reason people know these are the images of the right guy is because he worked at Pizza Hut in Warrington and actually bragged about his real identity and as such had to be removed and given a new identity for his own protection. This will be his 4th new identity.</p>

<p>My whole aim of exposing him was to force the judges to lock him up for life for his own protection, I&#39;m sick to death of this guy being given a slap on the wrists he&#39;s a serious danger to the public and children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think it&#39;s unlikely. Confide in family and friends, let them know that under no circumstance would you ever commit suicide, nor place yourself in life threatening situations. Tell them what you have been doing and what they need to do if anything does happen (don&#39;t worry though, it wont. Worst case senario is some jail time). Hopefully opening up to them will allow you to feel more at ease.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re doing a good thing, but I think you&#39;ve made some mistakes in how you have gone about it. You could always back up the blog, remove it and host a cheap domain through someone trustworthy? Could pay via bitcoin, always be behind a VPN and use an Alias for the contact details. Also could have a few mirrors up if the main site gets taken down.. Just a few ideas :) </p>

<p>You knew what you were doing was illegal, knew that the Police were dealing with matters, but chose to expose the man because you don&#39;t agree with his punishment - now you want freedom from the consequences of your actions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes the absurdity of laws needs to be taken into account. Especially if this guy was already recalled back to jail he&#39;s obviously a danger to kids yet OP is the one getting shafted by the law for doing the morally right thing. </p>

<p>What if they make breathing illegal. Should we have the same mindset as you did in your comment? Sometimes a line needs to be drawn and we need to start asking questions when things start going sideways yet it&#39;s suddenly okay because &quot;it&#39;s illegal&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are completely wrong as far as the law is concerned.  For example, in UK you can be sued for libel and/or slander and all they have to do is prove that what you said damaged their reputation and you are guilty for damage - truth is not a defense.  In the United States you CAN use truth as a defense, and as long as you can prove that what you said is true you cannot be sued for libel or slander.  The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees freedom of speech (in law if not in practice).  There is no such law in the UK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the US military, to paraphrase, enlisted men and women take an oath to take orders and obey the law. Officers, their leaders, take a very different oath. Again paraphrasing, the officer’s oath is to simply uphold the constitution. The difference is that an officer’s oath allows for disobeying. Also codified is the officer’s obligation to take due diligence through official channels but allowing for disobedience considering constraints. I would argue that what guy and others are doing is knowingly putting their asses on the line for what is right and asking for our help in the face of the expected aftermath. He is like LT Calley who took action in the My Lai massacre during the war in Vietnam. He is doing what’s right without deliberation and he hopes but does not expect that people are good enough to rally around him in order to affect change. </p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd that they&#39;ve given this despicable excuse of a human being this level of protection :(. I was shocked when I found out too, that&#39;s why other news sources around the world haven&#39;t revealed his identity as there&#39;s a worldwide injunction. </p>

<p>Here you acknowledge that it is costing the taxpayer a lot of money each time he’s exposed... so why are you trying to expose him?</p>

<p>The authorities are aware of the kiddy porn, and he’s never going be ‘let off the leash’, for want of a better phrase. His new identities are most likely already on a sex offender register and other kinds of lists. </p>

<p>I guess what my question is, what’s the end game here? What’s the goal? I thought I read that he’s going to gaol over the pedo stuff, but I don’t get what exposing his name achieves...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While Venebles should rot in a cell for the rest of his life, i&#39;m not buying this &#39;expose&#39; of Venebles by the op. R1ck3o poss some images of someone he claims to be Venebles, but offers no proof and then claims Venebles was working in Warrington in a pizza outlet.</p>

<p>No way would Venebles be so close to Liverpool where he killed that little boy, and no way would he be working in a pizza outlet where he could easily come into contact with James Bulgers parents / family.</p>

<p>Story does not add up.</p>

<p>Secondly, R1ck3o provides no proof that those images are Venebles, and in presenting them that way he is putting people who may look like whoever-it-is in those photo&#39;s in danger.</p>

<p>Yes, Venebles is a monster who deserves never to see the light of day again, i&#39;m sure few would argue differently - but this amateur vigilante-ism is not the way to go.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same with Maxine Carr - R1ck3o offers zero proof of the claims he makes. And, so what if Carr is working with vulnerable women - she is in fact in an ideal place to help vulnerable women as she has been where they are, in a bullying relationship living with a monster. Who better to help women than a woman who has been a victim herself?</p>

<p>R1ck3o&#39;s request for donations to fight legal costs that may ensue from his unsubstantiated claims adds another dimension to this.</p>

<p>Looks to me like R1ck3o has taken to two of the most emotive child abuse cases in recent history, made up some unsubstantiated bs and then asked for donations to fight a legal case which as yet has not been made.</p>

<p>Lets face it, if R1ck3o really had published images of the real John Venebles, the police would have his site shut down and R1ck3o charged with perverting the course of justice or contempt.</p>

<p>The images are still up, as are R1ck3o&#39;s unproven, unsubstantiated claims - no case has been launched by either the CPS or police.</p>

<p>And R1cj3o&#39;s requests for donations &#39;to fight the good fight&#39; are still live.</p>

<p>R1ck3o is a scam artist peddling lies and deception with unsubstantiated claims hoping to get people to give him £.</p>

<p>Most of his posts on this are deleted, his account on Dif has been deleted (and they don&#39;t usually do that) so the mods there are on to him.</p>

<p>Investigate it yourself, see if R1ck3o&#39;s claims add up - i have, and i have found that his claims don&#39;t hold water.</p>

<p>Ask why R1ck3o has a number of websites, all registered at different addresses and ask if someone who posts unsubstantiated claims, then asks for £ to fund a legal case that &#39;might&#39; be bought because of those claims is genuine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not defending anyone other than someone who may or may not be completely innocent. Op claims he knows the guy is who he claims he is. If that isn&#39;t true, that is fucked up of op for putting that information out there. Even if it is true, I must have missed op&#39;s comments saying he wants the guy in prison and not released. In his article he mentions people power and putting law enforcement up against wall, but I haven&#39;t seen any ideas for legislation to do such a thing as forcing repeat offenders into jail für long periods of life I&#39;m just worried that even if the person is who op says that someone might use that info to find and hurt the guy. Outside the law, vigilante justice isn&#39;t good. This isn&#39;t a Hollywood movie.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize that people are sometimes 110% sure that they&#39;re right, and yet . . . they&#39;re still wrong, right?  </p>

<p>And the consequences of you being wrong would be enormous given that you&#39;d accusing an innocent person of the most heinous type of crime and subjecting him to whatever vigilante &quot;justice&quot; might follow.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d say you didn&#39;t think this through, but it actually appears that you did and you a) don&#39;t care about the consequences and b) are doing this to get free money from gullible people and to promote your business.  </p>

<p>In short, hopefully the police will arrest you and you&#39;ll maybe learn that there are consequences for this kind of behavior. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>just to let you know, one of the james bulger murderers was moved on to the bomber estate, maidenhead, berkshire uk, into a block of flats overlooking the park (blenheim road over looking onto oaken grove park), il show you the the block here : <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Blenheim+Rd,+Maidenhead+SL6+5HD/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x487662a3e35e9c47:0x5dff19745f0f6257?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiw5sCdzPHXAhWFL8AKHVscBRQQ8gEIMzAB">https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Blenheim+Rd,+Maidenhead+SL6+5HD/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x487662a3e35e9c47:0x5dff19745f0f6257?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiw5sCdzPHXAhWFL8AKHVscBRQQ8gEIMzAB</a> </p>

<p>anyway. the bomber estate is what could be described as a rough council estate, housing some what some might refer to as &quot;gangster&quot; families. well, when this killer was moved there, the police actually went to the gangster families and told them who had moved on to the estate, which i dont know why, but it happened, and the reason i heard, was in case something really serious happened over this, and they were genuinely worried about the shit storm that would follow (if you know this estate, or the &quot;older&quot; families there, you will probably understand what i mean. do you know anything about this? it was common knowledge on the estate. and the block was directly over looking oaken grove, which happens to also be directly next to a primary school (wtf, i know). my uncle lives on that street, and has done for 20 years. hes lived in that town his whole life, so he knows what hes talking about. its one of those estates, thats never really changed, the families, that have lived their, have always lived their, with the exception of a few. if you know anything about this specific detail, please do let me know. you never know, you might even be able to use this as evidence with thames valley police (who are the police of the area).  of course, take this info cautiously, but i hope you already know about this. this info is at least a decade old. anywhere from 8 years to 13 years plus. because i livedwith my grandmother around that time, and spent alot of time on that estate (which i never really have done in my life since, or before then). make of this what you will</p>

<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/jonvenablespics">https://mobile.twitter.com/jonvenablespics</a></p>

<p>I just was reading some of the recent news articles that have been around lately and saw this image on a Google search.</p>

<p>After searching reddit for venables I came across an archive of your deleted post. It&#39;s intriguing (as it is to most of the nation) to know his identity. But if your sources are so correct and your willingness to expose him, why not expose the name? I&#39;m just questioning you&#39;re not just digging up false info for traffic. </p>

<p>But, I don&#39;t exactly disagree with you, it was a horrific crime and I still question who was the &#39;leader&#39; and thier lives now and the motivations behind it all. It&#39;s still worthy of public discussions, why wouldn&#39;t it be. </p>

<p>Already explained this one a dozen times in the comment section, the pictures aren&#39;t new by any means that&#39;s how we know they&#39;re correct.</p>

<p>Not giving up my source who is highly credible but I don&#39;t need to, Venables had the nerve to brag about his real identity to his PizzaHut colleagues and friends in Warrington. That&#39;s how the pictures are known to be true and not fakes, there was a fake of a read headed guy floating around years ago but these are the real deal.</p>

<p>His did himself in by giving away his identity, this is common knowledge and reported in the mainstream media. Trust me if they weren&#39;t all these years on they would have been debunked by now like the old photo which was a fake.</p>

<p>The fact is this guy boasts about his real identity and has on FOUR occasions now had to be handed a new identity that costs that British tax payer £250,000 every single time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps your answer lies in becoming so big that they can&#39;t touch you.  Maybe you could make YouTube videos of what your&#39;re doing?  Record yourself telling your story and say stuff like if I&#39;m killed, these people are responsible. etc.  You could give it to a friend to release if anything ever happened to you.   But if you&#39;re doing all this without real evidence, then I&#39;m against what you are doing.  If you have evidence that some kids are in danger then go for it. But if you&#39;re just condemning people for crimes they&#39;ve already paid the price for, I don&#39;t know if I would agree with what you are doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, you need to go to the right place for this. It&#39;s going to take time to find someone. A junior barrister may risk it but handling something  like this is career suicide for them. Older barristers will be expensive and unless you want to go to someone who is know for this kind of work, it could be difficult. Ever hear of exero news? They were shut down but were pretty big.  They may have some ideas. If not, google similar cases and find barristers or Chambers that have worked on injunctions. Look for family court Chambers.Not sure if your have previous offences but depending on the judge may get a slap on the wrist. Also, know that most barristers will take the case if they find it interesting enough and then work on paying them off over time. Finally, when you find people who you think might work, contact clerks not the barristers directly. They are too busy. It&#39;s the clerks who do that work. So, basically.... Google previous cases or find the guys from exxero if you can and then go from there. Target solicitors and junior barristers from family law chambers... Contact the clerks and see if they will touch you. Then, they will see you through. There are some out that will help you just keep searching and do it quick. </p>

since he lives in a civilized country, they do their time and some of them may be free after that and should be integrated back into society. 
There is no second or life long punishment like in savage countries by stigmatizing them or something like that. 
vigilantes like this guy are criminals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. OP is asking to be allowed to enact vigilante justice. If we let people do that shit then it totally undermines any system of law and order we have. </p>

<p>Although what the people OP is talking about did is horrific, we live in a civilised country where people are given a chance to do the right thing after punishment. There&#39;s no &#39;conspiracy&#39; to let people out of prison early, I suspect there are a lot of highly knowledgeable, highly experienced people making these decisions.</p>

<p>If people agree with OP and think people should be able to ignore these sort of systems, set up to protect human rights, might I suggest they move to a country which doesn&#39;t have such protections and see how they get on. </p>

You are doing something I guess that&#39;s commendable but it&#39;s irrelevant to the fact you&#39;re breaking a law.  To me if you really believe in your website and your cause you defend yourself but you must understand you may go to jail. I say it&#39;s commendable I guess because I live in the USA and I don&#39;t really know anything about most of the people on your website. So I have no knowledge about these cases except what you provide. I do think you&#39;re a bit conspiracy whacky.  But that&#39;s ok. I kind of compare your case here to this.  If I were to beat the crap out of a pedophile here in America people would certainly say I did the right thing or he deserved it. But I still assaulted someone and I&#39;ll likely go to jail.  It&#39;s just the facts of committing a crime. If I&#39;m caught I must pay the penalty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I was wondering why in the hell they would be protected.</p>

<p>From the Wikipedia article:</p>

<p>Shortly after the trial, and after the judge had recommended a minimum sentence of eight years, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, recommended that the two boys should serve a minimum of ten years,[7] which would have made them eligible for release in February 2003 at the age of 20.</p>

<p>So, they were 10 years old when they committed the crime, so that explains a bit the reason for the new identities initially, but that should completely go away with the subsequent charges later IMO.  Sorry, this was just the 1st I ever heard of this and needed a little more background.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to condone protecting evil people because you&#39;re right, the guy that OP described sounds like a nasty piece of work. But he was also a 10 year old boy at the time he committed the crime that he was imprisoned for. I can&#39;t really comment much more on the issue because I&#39;m not familiar with the circumstances (and if he was distributing child porn then that&#39;s also fucked up) but nobody asked OP to take justice into his own hands, he decided to work outside the realm of the law and didn&#39;t protect his identity so now he&#39;s apparently scared for his life. </p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t think his life is actually in danger, he&#39;s just shitting his pants because he knows he committed a crime and could lose 2 years of his life in prison for what he did, and I have trouble feeling bad for him since he knew full well that he was involving himself and creating trouble when he decided to get involved and identify someone who was under a witness protection kinda scheme. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I can read properly. </p>

<p>I read your previous comment and then decided that you were possibly a closet pedo based on the fact that you went out of your way to not only comment on how much you despise pedophiles, but also accuse me of sympathising with them?</p>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly easy to forget that there&#39;s another human on the other side of this wall of text that I type to, and I shouldn&#39;t have insulted you in the way that I did in my previous comment. </p>

<p>So yeah, you&#39;re more than welcome to continue visualising me as a big lump of smelly shit because I was way out of line with what I said, so my apologies once again, I got caught up in the moment and know it was stupid as fuck of me. </p>

<p>As an internet stranger I can&#39;t give you much more than that shitty apology that I typed above, but I&#39;m sending my well wishes towards you for having a good day and shit like that, if that helps and such :p</p>

<p>Regardless of whether OP is in the right or wrong, nobody likes a paedophile. however for something as heinous as stated they should be name and shamed, nobody should get a second chance after that.</p>

<p>You know exposing his new id is only going to force the government to give him a new id and cost UK tax payers more money, bringing the total cost of keeping him safe after release to upwards of 1.2M.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;re trying to act official and not just look like you&#39;re trying to incite violence, but you know there is no other way this can end other than by you exposing him so someone still caring enough can find and kill him.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really have any other point to this other than telling you while I find what you&#39;re doing makes sense and people like him shouldn&#39;t be protected like this after release, at the same time the ONLY reason to do this is because you want him to die.</p>

Back to the actual meaning of my post: I all for doing it through official ways [yes even if they have been wrong before]. The reason is that far less people get killed wrongly than if you let the peasants loose with torches and pitchforks. Or do you think that an uneducated mob is right more often than a jury after listening to evidence?</p>

<p>Since when did i say a 10 year old?
You didn&#39;t but did you read the OP? To quote <strong>the post these comments are on:</strong></p>

<p>I posted 11 days ago to tell you all about Jon Venables a man who at the age of 10 killed, raped and murdered a 2-year-old boy, he mutiltaed him, poored paint into his eyes, threw rocks at his head, sexually assaulted him and stuck batteries in the two year olds anus and mouth.</p>

<p>And would you like to hear about <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soham_murders#Maxine_Carr">Maxine Carr</a>, the other person OP is claiming to expose? She&#39;s not even a pedo. Is perversion of justice really a big enough crime that you people are willing to go to jail for exposing her, even after she&#39;s served her sentence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So... You have nothing as far as any real evidence, that says you’re being targeted.  This is the same as me claiming “Guys, I went 10 mph over the speed limit on my way home.  Surely, the cops will break through my door anytime now.”  </p>

<p>To be honest, it sounds like you’re neck deep in some LARP or just going for website traffic with the sensationalism. </p>

<p>Your title says you exposed people, but (by your own admission, in the comments) you never posted anything that wasn’t already viral on Facebook.  You were <strong>reporting</strong> on pictures that had been shared over 120,000 times before, not exposing some big secret.  Just jumping on the bandwagon, except you wrote a blog post instead of “sharing” it.  </p>

<p>The news link you posted is obviously referring to the same Facebook posts referenced in the hundreds of other news stories about the same thing.  Of course they say “social media,” but it takes about 30 seconds with Google to find better articles with clarification.  </p>

<p>So on the factual surface, this barely registers as here-say.</p>

<p>Speaking on a general level, and not specifically to this case, it blows my mind that people don’t see the damage they can do posting an innocent person’s name/image all over the Internet, tying them to a brutal murder.  Who cares what your 110% positive sources say, who you can’t disclose?  That’s childish.  </p>

<p>Even if you were right sometimes, it is about establishing and maintaining the precedent.  Even if 999 of 1000 “public convictions” are correct, it’s seriously fucked that last 1 person minding their own business, then being given a label like murderer or pedophile.  </p>

<p>While the end goal is understandable, it’s NOT okay to risk innocent peoples’ livelihoods with public witch hunts.  Which is EXACTLY why there are laws to prevent that happening.  It’s not a case-by-case basis where you pick and choose when to follow the law, either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the perpetrators were minors when they committed the crimes it is UK law that they should have remained anonymous. At the time of the crime it was so heinous and shocking that there was hourly updates on the case for weeks on end. I can&#39;t tell you how big this was here in the UK. </p>

<p>Due to the gravity of the crime and the public outrage (rightly so) the names and details of the perpetrators was made public, despite them being minors. This was unprecedented I think. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t be sure of how this next part came about but I am sure the wiki page should be able to clarify. I think what happened was, one of the boy&#39;s lawyers argued that due to them being minors thier identity should have remained anonymous as per the law as it stands. The judge agreed and said they deserved the same rights as all other minors that commit crimes. The judge had a caviat though. He said he wanted them both monitored for a set amount of years in case they commit crimes again (Jon Venebles has continuosly been found to have illegal porn despite being monitored, making me think he is beyond redemption and is possibly of very low intelligence. . .)</p>

<p>Not saying I agree with the judge, just saying it&#39;s similar to the US constitution. If they were not allowed new identities then all minors would have to lose their right to remain anonymous. It would have set a new precedent which they didn&#39;t want to do as most minors that commit horrific acts like this are themselves victims and it&#39;s harder to rehabilitate a minor when the have to live in hiding from the public. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t have liked to make the call that the judge did. It&#39;s an ethical dilemma. I agree with OP. He is clearly a danger to children and people probably should have the right to know his new identity if it helps keep their children safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the synopsis. So would they still get new identities if their names weren&#39;t released to the public during the trial? Cuz its still fucked then. You shouldn&#39;t be able to escape from that sort of thing once you&#39;ve done it. There are some things that you just have to live or die with that result from your actions. In the US I thought that if you commit crimes against children you end up in the sex offenders database so that people know where you live and can avoid you. I used to live right above a old dude who was on that list for exposing himself to a kid and there were kids that lived in the apartment building too. I&#39;m not sure if those parents knew about him but at least they would be able to find out if they wanted to. Yikes as a parent I would definitely want to know something like that especially given that guy&#39;s crimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt that your intentions are well-motivated, however you&#39;ve admitted that you know your actions are illegal and you&#39;ve revealed nothing that hadn&#39;t already been publicly leaked (illegally). I can&#39;t see what you hoped to achieve. Venables has already been set up with at least one new identity since his images were first leaked, you&#39;ve added nothing new about his identity, and you&#39;ve also put yourself right in the firing line. I can guarantee you&#39;re not going to get bumped off, but they&#39;re gonna throw the book at you man, and to be honest you&#39;ve only really got yourself to blame. Jamie Bulger&#39;s dad has been pushing for a change in the law for years, but he&#39;s never broken it, and you can&#39;t tell me you&#39;re more emotionally invested in this case than he is. Last time the people linking the images got off with suspended sentences, considering you&#39;ve been far more in your face about it you&#39;re liable to get treated far worse. Good luck to you, but I&#39;d start taking your tactics from people like Aangrifan, Spivey and Bill Mahoney, I&#39;m sure you know of them, they cover the same subjects but stick to the law, we all think it&#39;s bullshit, but we all have to follow it, or else we end up in the shit like you.</p>

<li><p>Get a lawyer. Any lawyer. Tell him the entirety. No lies, omissions, or such, tell him everything. </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;I specifically mentioned in my article that I knew what I was doing was illegal but I needed to do something to try and ensure this sick pervert wasn&#39;t released onto our streets again.&quot; Delete this. redact. Let THEM prove it. Off course, if you have allready published it, expect the punishment to be harsher than you not realising what you did. Didn&#39;t kno shit. UNless you of course posted it previously, in quoted articles, and the people ask you, did you or didn&#39;t you &quot;know that this would get me in jail, but fuck it, come on, show me what you got&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Pray to the gods you gave a perfect history. Meaning, no silly side experiements, no &quot;I can&#39;t proove he is a pedo, but so I have to post this. &quot;. You would get away with this if you were a female poting about rape, not otherwise. Expect one count for everytime you knew it was insufficient evidence. Possibly slander. Gonna get expensive. try to keep it low. </p></li>
<li><p>Best strategy? Appear like damaged goods. Have a history of seeing help for your own problems, tell them you could never forget how you were molested as a boy. Th side you want to show is that you are so fucked in the head, you didn&#39;t mean anything by it, you just tried to maybe help an other boy or two from having to endure what you had to endure.  Most likely, your lawyer will try somnething similar. Try to stay calm about it. </p></li>
<li><p>If you even think about going &quot;Well, it&#39;s flaunting the law, but I don&#39;t give a fuck&quot;, don&#39;t count on this being handled softly. they will NEED to make an example out of you, and it&#39;s going to hurt. Imagine asbo, but roughly, from the ammount, one asbo per incident. And that is when they have the idea that you DON&#39;T do it gain. IF you do continue to flaunt the law, or even make it seem so, expect some creative shit, like being unable to own or operate a computer. We live in the age of internet harassment, and anti online trolling laws. If you are lucky, all you get out of this is asbos. </p></li>
<li><p>So, most likely, you will go to jail. Since you have a social media platform that paints you as unapologetic and ready to do it again, you will go to jail, and if you have a website that is registered to you, and have openly insinuated even &quot;fuck those laws that kick in, fuck them, and I will allways disobey them&quot; you will go to jail for a LONG time. And if you try to make a last stand in court, going to argue your point, and hoping against all odds that maybe, this will change that law, because it is unjust, please: If you have ANY leads on your website where it is not crystal clear, those leads will be upgraded to attempted witchhunt. When you are read that this could lead to false arrests, and false public convictions, and then go, but someone has tampered with &quot;MY&quot; mail, try to swallow that this is what it will be like. And they will make a cutesy remark on how this follows you around, even if you get freed of jail, and will destroy your chances of finding employment, and how this is why they have LAWS like the one you broke that kills this after a time. </p></li>
<li><p>One ray of hope. Most likely, you will be popular in jail. Too popular for anyone to off you. Because noone in there did what they sit for. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re in the UK look into getting in touch with the team that worked with Pete Townshend of The Who when he was arrested for collecting evidence to use against pedophiles. Or try to reach out to him directly through twitter or something. I know that he was facing criminal charges for bringing the evidence to the police and the case was ultimately settled or what ever they do in the UK, but a high profile figure fighting the same cause as you couldn&#39;t hurt to have on your side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those calling me a scam or a con-artist because I own a &#39;digital marketing agency&#39; why not do your proper research and have a look at the reviews, the &#39;agency&#39; is just me, my personal website advertises that yes I do some web design, I haven&#39;t had any work since the beginning of the year look at the reviews and see that for yourself. Why do I leave my website up? Why wouldn&#39;t I? If potential work comes in, the issue is I design a website for £50 or £100 once in awhile to top up my income because I can&#39;t work due to illness, come on guys you&#39;re really calling me out for that.</p>

<p>If anyone had bothered to ask I would have been clear on that it&#39;s not something I&#39;m trying to hide, if I was, I would have taken my website down. To be clear, I never started this thread with a GoFundMe Links and stated several times to people in the comments that I&#39;d rather not make it about money as then things like this happen and people start accusing me of doing this to make money when actually running Free &amp; Fearless has ALWAYS been about trying to do something about child abuse.</p>

<p>Why some feel a need to investigate me I don&#39;t know why, nobody is forced to donate, I recieved 1 donation out of all the dozens of people asking me to setup a GoFundMe I&#39;ll just take it down it&#39;s not worth the hassle.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll see that this isn&#39;t a scam once the police finally do come, please point out to me any other website that the guardian article describes, I know no other site or journalist who has exposded venables and admitted they knew what they were doing was breaking the law and has exposed information about Maxine Carr at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those calling me a scam or a con-artist because I own a &#39;digital marketing agency&#39; why not do your proper research and have a look at the reviews, the &#39;agency&#39; is just me, my personal website advertises that yes I do some web design, I haven&#39;t had any work since the beginning of the year look at the reviews and see that for yourself. Why do I leave my website up? Why wouldn&#39;t I? If potential work comes in, the issue is I design a website for £50 or £100 once in awhile to top up my income because I can&#39;t work due to illness, come on guys you&#39;re really calling me out for that.</p>

<p>If anyone had bothered to ask I would have been clear on that it&#39;s not something I&#39;m trying to hide, if I was, I would have taken my website down. To be clear, I never started this thread with a GoFundMe Links and stated several times to people in the comments that I&#39;d rather not make it about money as then things like this happen and people start accusing me of doing this to make money when actually running Free &amp; Fearless has ALWAYS been about trying to do something about child abuse.</p>

<p>Why some feel a need to investigate me I don&#39;t know why, nobody is forced to donate, I recieved 1 donation out of all the dozens of people asking me to setup a GoFundMe I&#39;ll just take it down it&#39;s not worth the hassle.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll see that this isn&#39;t a scam once the police finally do come, please point out to me any other website that the guardian article describes, I know no other site or journalist who has exposded venables and admitted they knew what they were doing was breaking the law and has exposed information about Maxine Carr at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found one comment suggesting you open a gofundme - from this user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/09dany09">https://www.reddit.com/user/09dany09</a> A user with four other comments, a suspicious account that could easily be prepared by an &#39;SEO expert&#39; </p>

<p>You claim you&#39;re too ill to work, but you&#39;ve done lots of work recently, within a few minutes I found a number of articles by you within the last 3 months - several of which are on sites which pay for submitted content (Source : am a freelance writer). One of which - your medium article about elsagate, was published less than a month ago <a href="https://medium.com/@Rickeo/what-is-elsagate-why-you-should-be-concerned-a0470668b6e8">https://medium.com/@Rickeo/what-is-elsagate-why-you-should-be-concerned-a0470668b6e8</a> </p>

<p>It clearly promotes both your &#39;whistleblowing&#39; website and your digital marketing agency and we both know that articles on Medium are paid through the claps system, another lie you&#39;ve been caught out in. </p>

<p>You claim you&#39;ve exposed Venables, you&#39;ve exposed nothing, only re-printed previously printed photos of him and offered no further information than what was already (illegally) published. All you&#39;ve done is broken laws that are there to stop the sort of vigilantism that you seem so keen to promote. No-one else has broken the law and then admitted to it because no-one else would be that fucking stupid. The mere fact that you&#39;re likely to be arrested doesn&#39;t eliminate the fact that this is a fairly transparent self-promotion tactic for your own online business. None of us like the fucking law, but doing what you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t going to change it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK well you&#39;re entirely wrong.</p>

<p>Medium pay for work? Wasn&#39;t aware, not been paid a single dime of them show me the way to prove this and I&#39;ll show you I&#39;ve not earnt a single cent from Medium or any other place my articles are posted, I post across multiple websites to keep copies of my work/backups if I site got took down and to get more people reading my work.</p>

<p>How many claps have I got via Medium? Hardly any if any at all, plus you need to sign up for their partner programme or something which I am NOT apart of and will prove this to anyone who recommends me how to provide that proof.</p>

<p>As for one person mentioning I start a GoFund Me, read all the comments and sub comments you&#39;re totally wrong, there are several people who mention GoFundMe and there are several others who just ask for a way to donate financially.</p>

<p>As for your personal beliefs on what I&#39;m doing so be it, your own personal opinion, I&#39;ll still keep posting about paedophiles and keeping them off the streets.</p>

<p>Seems like you have a personal vendetta against me, I wont be justifying myself to you any longer, 90% of the work I&#39;ve done has been my own work for my own websites that I haven&#39;t received any payment for, use blockchain explorer on the bitcoin address&#39; zero donations since the website started, I&#39;ve designed two websites this year, granted I&#39;ve designed logos on my Instagram but 99.9% of these have been for free to build up a portfolio or for friends and family.</p>

<p>Carry on with your little investigation into me, I have nothing to hide, message the people I&#39;ve done logos for or their companies you&#39;ll find they&#39;ve either been for free or part of contests I haven&#39;t won.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know what it is with your little witchhunt against me, if people like I&#39;ll remove the GoFundMe and take the donation pages offline if enough people request me to do so, I wont on your call as it seems you have some sort of issue with me personally.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never wanted the donation section to subtract from what I&#39;m doing, I don&#39;t do it for that, like I said I&#39;ve received one donation of £15 that&#39;s it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More bullshit - Answered point by point </p>

<p>1) Claim you&#39;re the victim of a witchhunt when you get called out on your bullshit. </p>

<p>2) Payment on articles such as medium are gathered over time (as you well know) Others are paid by base rate depending on the site, and other sites pay creators a share of ad revenue, seems unlikely that someone as poor as you wouldn&#39;t have taken advantage of this considering your considerable output on various sites.</p>

<p>3) You&#39;re not keeping any pedophiles off of the streets, only rehashing old publicly available material and contravening a law that anyone with half a brain (aangirfan, chris spivey, pie N mash films for example) have easily been able to easily work around while actually doing something useful against child molesters </p>

<p>4) You offer website design, website marketing, website hosting, blogging &amp; content on various sites, including tumblr, facebook, instagram, your own sites and various other places - Your internet activity is pretty extensive for a guy supposedly too ill to work, and far too much effort for someone getting virtually nothing for it - you work a damn sight more than me </p>

<p>5) I&#39;m not investigating you, or conducting a witchhunt, but I&#39;m started to get tempted, you&#39;ll know if I fucking start one pal. You&#39;re a scam artist attempting to cash in on a pedo scandal, scam well-meaning people out of their cash and promote your own marketing company. Quit your bullshit pal. </p>

<p>DIRECT QUOTE FROM Woorank: </p>

<p>&#39;I am currently a freelance web designer, developer, SEO consultant and digital marketer. I have worked for some of Manchester&#39;s largest and well known Marketing companies designing websites for some of the biggest companies in the UK. I specialise not only in web design but in SEO and digital marketing helping companies &#39;&#39;get found&#39;&#39; online.</p>

<p>My goal is to help business&#39; establish a strong online presence making the best possible first and lasting impression.</p>

<p>I work on a freelance basis as apart of a network of freelancers. This gives me the freedom and ability to be flexible with my prices and the projects I work on.&#39;</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t seem like the sort of guy who&#39;s going to work 20+ hours a week for charity does it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pedophilia? You&#39;re a sick, twisted human being. It&#39;s not your sexual orientation, you have a mental disorder.</p>

<p>Hebephilia? Basically regarded as just as bad as the above.</p>

<p>Ephebophilia: The primary sexual interest in mid-to-late adolescents, generally ages 15 to 19. Seeing as the most popular pornography is depicting women aged 18-20, we&#39;re talking like 90% of the male population?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not defending pedophilia or hebephilia, but I find it odd how those people are the devil for simply having a predilection for children, when we&#39;ve assigned an arbitrary age for being &quot;adult&quot; and that is regarded as okay, even though even those 18 year olds are still sexually and mentally immature, and perhaps even just as capable of sexual consent as a 15 or 16 year old.</p>

<p>Obviously pedophilia and hebephilia are bad, we especially don&#39;t want grown ass people molesting little 10 year olds, but I think we should have a little more sympathy. If the arbitrary line for sexual consent were drawn at 15, there would be legal porn of 15 year olds, and a majority of men wouldn&#39;t be too far from being hebephiles and pedophiles. I&#39;d say a majority of men would admit to being attracted to 18 year old women, and that&#39;s still really creepy.</p>

<p>Now they will try and disprove it, as long as you have concrete evidence you will be fine. Its not that what you&#39;re doing is illegal, but they will twist it into being something that actually is illegal.</p>

If you get it on a popular newspaper even once, it will likely spread from there, cause investigation, give <em>you</em> all the credibility and trust in the world to actually seeing the truth and taking your time to get facts and sources on it. People these days appreciate honesty and more or less, &#39;being different&#39; from the mass. Oh, and the public hates pedophiles. In this situation, it should be your priority to get attention.

    <div class="md"><p>hello,</p>

<p>I am a representative of the ((( illuminati )))</p>

<p>I am here to offer both an explanation and an apology for OP&#39;s situation.</p>

<p>First of all what OP witnessed was not the rape and murder of children, but a ritual interspecies orgy held between human members of the illuminati and the sparkly vampires that some mormon cunt wrote a book about. </p>

<p>Easy mistake to make, sparkly vampires are often mistaken for children.</p>

<p>You may have also heard that another interspecies orgy we held recently caused the massive california wildfires. </p>

<p>What can I say? We&#39;re horny, we&#39;re creepy, shit gets lit fam. </p>

<p>However, in keeping with our recent acquisition of the entity known as &quot;Anonymous&quot;, we have decided to rebrand ourselves as a kinder and more playful interdimensional, dictatorial entity. </p>

<p>In the future, we will be doing things merely to be playful, mischievous cunts as opposed to designs on world domination. </p>

<p>tl;dr World Domination is gay, we just wanna get high with aliens. </p>

<p>The images aren&#39;t a huge secret at all, when he was first released there was a false image of him being spread around, these however are the real deal.</p>

<p>One key reason people know these are the images of the right guy is because he worked at Pizza Hut in Warrington and actually bragged about his real identity and as such had to be removed and given a new identity for his own protection. This will be his 4th new identity.</p>

<p>My whole aim of exposing him was to force the judges to lock him up for life for his own protection, I&#39;m sick to death of this guy being given a slap on the wrists he&#39;s a serious danger to the public and children.</p>

<p>I feel that if I set up a gofundme or anything like that and advertise that it will take away some credit for what I&#39;m doing and make it more about making money as opposed to stopping dirty scumbag paedophiles and child abusers.</p>

<p>Truth be told I&#39;ve not received one donation on my website to date, I was even considering removing the donation sections because of that fact, I fund the website out of my own back pocket and out of a passion for the cause.</p>

<p>I could definitely use some help moving the site to an offshore server though, I think that&#39;s the next step for them to get my web host to take it offline. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, to the contrary I want him to be locked up for life and not released onto the streets of the UK again, he&#39;s a danger to the public and our children.</p>

<p>Not going to get into the debate about capital punishment, my idea was that if enough people seen his photo the judge would be forced to lock him up for life for his own safety. I know that was probably naive in hindsight. </p>

<p>If anything happened to him in prison as a result of my post (doubtful as he&#39;s kept in solitary for his own safety) then I&#39;d live what that guilt, this man is a monster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to condone protecting evil people because you&#39;re right, the guy that OP described sounds like a nasty piece of work. But he was also a 10 year old boy at the time he committed the crime that he was imprisoned for. I can&#39;t really comment much more on the issue because I&#39;m not familiar with the circumstances (and if he was distributing child porn then that&#39;s also fucked up) but nobody asked OP to take justice into his own hands, he decided to work outside the realm of the law and didn&#39;t protect his identity so now he&#39;s apparently scared for his life. </p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t think his life is actually in danger, he&#39;s just shitting his pants because he knows he committed a crime and could lose 2 years of his life in prison for what he did, and I have trouble feeling bad for him since he knew full well that he was involving himself and creating trouble when he decided to get involved and identify someone who was under a witness protection kinda scheme. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with many court decisions myself, but I&#39;m not stupid enough to go against the law in the way that OP did and jeopardize my own life in the process.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can I just ask why we need to spend money to keep scumbags safe?? They first got new identities because they murdered someone at a young age, so fair enough, but why the fuck are we covering up adult paedophiles who keep comitting the same crimes? They should be getting life imprisonment or death row. 
If this is the law then we need to riot against it, not just sit back and accept the fact that pedos with new identities are living amongst us and our children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found one comment suggesting you open a gofundme - from this user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/09dany09">https://www.reddit.com/user/09dany09</a> A user with four other comments, a suspicious account that could easily be prepared by an &#39;SEO expert&#39; </p>

<p>You claim you&#39;re too ill to work, but you&#39;ve done lots of work recently, within a few minutes I found a number of articles by you within the last 3 months - several of which are on sites which pay for submitted content (Source : am a freelance writer). One of which - your medium article about elsagate, was published less than a month ago <a href="https://medium.com/@Rickeo/what-is-elsagate-why-you-should-be-concerned-a0470668b6e8">https://medium.com/@Rickeo/what-is-elsagate-why-you-should-be-concerned-a0470668b6e8</a> </p>

<p>It clearly promotes both your &#39;whistleblowing&#39; website and your digital marketing agency and we both know that articles on Medium are paid through the claps system, another lie you&#39;ve been caught out in. </p>

<p>You claim you&#39;ve exposed Venables, you&#39;ve exposed nothing, only re-printed previously printed photos of him and offered no further information than what was already (illegally) published. All you&#39;ve done is broken laws that are there to stop the sort of vigilantism that you seem so keen to promote. No-one else has broken the law and then admitted to it because no-one else would be that fucking stupid. The mere fact that you&#39;re likely to be arrested doesn&#39;t eliminate the fact that this is a fairly transparent self-promotion tactic for your own online business. None of us like the fucking law, but doing what you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t going to change it. </p>
