Just follow his narrative on Pizzagate, far too many holes, way away from the typical AJ character.

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, come on. The continued attachment of theories and rabbit holes they want to discredit that they&#39;ve glued to him is numerous. I know not everyone has fully open the gate of truth that is Pizzagate but that debacle with him proves how easily he can be manipulated to distort the message. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the goal here, you get us to associate Q with AJ that way we don&#39;t go and look at Q source material and start eating out of the AJ feeding tube? No thanks, he tainted himself like everyone else that shilled for the distortion of pizzagate. He hasn&#39;t asked for forgiveness for lying or miss leading so the logical option is simple here. Look at Q material yourself, read information yourself, come to your own conclusion. Remember the liars and shills they won&#39;t ever play a different game with us. I for one, am not going to sit by and watch more people get turned in to cash cows for this hyper shill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, that aside- how to you explain the continued and aggravated approach he takes to conspiracy theories and the fact that he himself admitted that Alex Jones is a character? Anything that touches the truth too closely is given an expose by him and he turns the crazy dial as high as he can. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree, selling things by default doesn&#39;t make him a liar and monster. However, money is the root of all evil so its important to consider that his opinion and character are a by product of this. </p>

<p>That’s how you report this stuff and don’t get killed imo. I’d agree on some stuff he could cool down a bit.  </p>

<p>How should he make money if YouTube demonetizes everything? What’s your recommendation?? I think the way he does it is actually the best and least contradictory way (if at all).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a better way, Q is possibly achieving that. I talk to people calmly about the things I see and what my point of view is on them. I don&#39;t take the issue and make it even more outlandish than it already is. If you have no qualms about AJ and pay no attention to the way he moves products on his site then that&#39;s up to you. You can chose to ignore the fact that he does or paint it however you want. It feeds in to the same system most of us abhor. I don&#39;t need to do anything you &quot;ask me to do&quot; because stating that information can be presented calmly, accurately and correctly without attempting to shove supplements down people&#39;s throats is possible. </p>

<p>My better way is being presented here, talk to people like people. Offer them information that they can digest and explore on their own. This doesn&#39;t need some long panned out plan, that is unless of course you believe that the majority of the population is beyond reprieve and has lost their tethered from their logic. I still believe people are good and given the opportunity to look at facts presented outside the salesman persona, uncensored will come to make the right choice. </p>

<p>I suspect you do not see the world this way, in which case we live in two fundamentally different realities. Physical force, emotional force and sales force are not needed to open up the mind of a person. </p>

<p>“Capitalism sucks!”
What do you want to replace it with?
“I don’t have to answer that but it sucks!”</p>

<p>You can simultaneously believe that people are inherently good (free system vs. totalitarian system which believes people are at their root evil) while also seeing how many of our fellow humans have been brainwashed and conditioned by decades (or centuries if you’d like) of programming.</p>

<p>AJ saying they’re turning the frickin frogs gay which most everyone will remember, on either side. If I get into a discussion with someone and AJ comes up, they’ll likely bring up “isn’t he that turning the frogs gay guy?”</p>

<p>I’ll then show them the scientific studies that validate his position.</p>

<p>This site provides the link to the study as well as covers some parts of it. Very impartial approach as well:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So everyone responds perfectly to calm collective discourse with concrete facts and details? That’s just not true, people aren’t robots and a vast majority are not informed to that level and are willing to get into conversations of that depth.</p>

<p>Salesmanship is important for everything. It doesn’t matter how good your idea is if you can’t sell it. That being said even if you are a perfect salesman with a flawless product, not everyone is going to buy it. That’s just the way it is and for those that don’t “buy it” there will be other people with other ways of selling their thing that might hit home. Maybe none of the ideas will ever hit those people.</p>

<p>There’s no “one best way” to sell an idea. There are many different techniques and AJ’s is his own and it works for a percentage of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A percentage of people, typically people who are already open to these ideas. You do see that right? You will never break free the minds of the common person with this. The first step for anyone to come out of the MSM trance is to feel betrayed. Fear makes people less likely to change their believes since it triggers survival responses. Survival wants to stick to memory, survival wants to live based on passed experience. When threatened with the &quot;end of the world&quot; people will adhere to what they believe even more. Exposing lies and liars especially in people who were formally respected causes anger and often feelings of vengeance. When this new found anger starts to swell a person will typically look for things to justify their anger. </p>

<p>In this state, someone approaches Alex Jones who is busy talking about, sorry yelling about, gay frogs and then cutting to a commercial for water purifiers, bunkers and male supplements. No one who is looking for new information and facts to support what they believe will take him seriously. </p>

<p>Also, I go back to my original point. He shilled Pizzagate. Huge red flag. It puts him in the same camp as Megan Kelly. </p>
