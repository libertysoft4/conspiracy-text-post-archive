    <div class="md"><p>Did it turn out to be mass hysteria or was it just much simpler to derail as a movement back then without an active interweb, meaning it was much easier to cover up and to subsequently declare it was all just &quot;mass hysteria&quot;?</p>

<p>Honest question. After all, it&#39;s undoubtedly true that many treacherous and even &quot;satanic&quot; deeds are being carried out every day, from enslaving people over abusing them sexually, all the way to torture and murder for fun or ritual purposes. It&#39;s undoubtedly true that many so-called world-leaders engage in those things.</p>

<p>It&#39;s reasonable to assume that this is not a new phenomenon, but an age-old tradition that is based on the mechanisms of power and control. </p>

<p>So I guess I&#39;m having a hard time reconciling that information with the claim that the satanic panic was nothing but mass hysteria. Was mass hysteria involved? Like in pizzagate, I would say probably, yes. There are always claims and comments that take a premise overboard (like claiming Jon Stewart is part of the cabal because he did a bit about a talking slice of pepperoni pizza), but they are outliers and shouldn&#39;t detract from the core claims.</p>

<p>Just my 2c, though.</p>

<p>Well, no conspiracy theory has ever been as rigorously investigated as the Satanic Panic. Remember, many innocent people spent years behind bars. Slowly, as the hysteria lifted and the truth came out particularly around manipulative psychiatric and policing techniques. To date, not one case was officially confirmed and cases such as McMartins preschool show just how far the hysteria went.</p>

<p>You claim there was a cover up, but you forget that all of the cases were overturned in a court of law. Prior to that, it was all over the media. Everyone was talking about it. There were wild accusations about tens of thousands of children being ritualistically abused and many innocent people went to prison. It was only after the truth was realised that these people were released, some after many years. This was not swept under the rug at all. It was a full-blown witch hunt that was only slowly challenged by reason. </p>

<p>This is an elementary error in logic that people make. Because some people carry out evil acts, that means the Satanic Panic is real. No, that is not correct. Again, just because there are paedophiles in powerful positions it does not mean that Pizzagate is real. You have to change the scope and definition of the Satanic Panic and Pizzagate so much that they are no longer the conspiracies they originally were. Again, just because the government lies to us does not mean that they always lie to us. If you find a case of satanic ritual abuse it is not evidence for the Satanic Panic being real. And to deny that the Satanic Panic is real is not to deny satanic abuse takes place either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s undoubtedly true that many so-called world-leaders engage in those things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Evidence needed. Pure conjecture. Again, an attempt to shift the scope and nature of the conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s reasonable to assume that this is not a new phenomenon, but an age-old tradition that is based on the mechanisms of power and control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you are presuming the truth behind the conspiracy without evidence. It is not reasonable to assume this unless you already accept the Satanic Panic to be real. That has not been established. In fact, it was consistently disproved in a court of law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I guess I&#39;m having a hard time reconciling that information with the claim that the satanic panic was nothing but mass hysteria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The core claims at the heart of the Satanic Panic were absolutely hysteria. Read up on McMartins preschool. Read up on the “victims” and how they were questioned by police.</p>

<p>the core claims at the center of the McMartin case were children with physical signs of anal and vaginal abuse. Don&#39;t believe the over hype of mass hysteria. It&#39;s a psyop term used after the fact to shape the narrative. Think jonestown.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, the McMartin case has serious issues, there was an element of hysteria, but don&#39;t rewrite it as though it were all made up. Some of those kids were abused by someone and they&#39;ve never been apprehended. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, sure, round up 360 children and--sadly--you&#39;ll almost certainly find that several of them have been abused. But that&#39;s just another sad consequence of witch hunts like McMartin: it allows a convenient scapegoat for actual abusers (probably parents, since most abuse is inter-family) to get away with their crimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. The first accuser was one of the kids moms who was convinced by her son&#39;s painful bowel movements that he had been abused. That same mom went on to make a series of bizarre allegations about teachers at the school, accusing them of sex with animals, and flying.  </p>

<p>The two cases where there may have been some kind of abuse came from children who were later rounded up. They picked them because they had the only actual medical evidence of abuse out of the whole group. Which, again, is not surprising that you&#39;d find someone how had been abused in a group that large; and, more importantly, the witch hunt allowed the real abusers to escape justice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry you are still wrong. have you considered you may have a bad source? </p>

<p>&quot;But the Manhattan Beach Police did not begin this case on the word of Judy Johnson. Instead, they were moved by the medical evidence of anal trauma on her son. Johnson did not come to the police station on August 12; she went to her family doctor who, after examining her son, referred him to an Emergency Room. That doctor recommended that the boy be examined by a specialist. The pediatric specialist is the one who reported to the Manhattan Beach Police Department that “the victim’s anus was forcibly entered several days ago.”</p>

<p>from the professor that wrote the book on it. Here is his research on the subject reviewed in an academic journal. see if you can even find another &quot;satanic panic&quot; book that meets that muster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That book, while good in some ways, is particularly dangerous in other ways. Because it presents a purported neutral, academic take on the case, while in reality the author elevates details that help his case and diminishes those that don&#39;t.  </p>

<p>However, my own criticisms aside, the author himself notes that the rashes and friction trauma on the victim might, in light of modern knowledge about what constitutes a &quot;normal&quot; exam for a child that age, not be evidence of sexual assault.  </p>

<p>Moreover, two pediatricians at UCLA dismissed the original findings as evidence of abuse.  </p>

<p>The larger point here is that the two girls who had the strongest evidence of abuse were from the collection of 360 children that were interviewed. </p>
