<p>Critically view any evidence or idea.</p>

<p>Never insult anyone who is discussing an idea that seems far fetched to you. If the idea is wrong/stupid to you it should be easy to disprove and you should do so, respectfully. I&#39;m not shitting on other people, I have been guilty of this in the past.</p>

<p>Shills do exist but you can&#39;t treat people like they are just for not agreeing with you. Answer any criticism with legitimate evidence. Even if you are completely convinced they are not genuine you should treat them like they are. Any evidence of actual shilling should be gathered and presented. Truth and facts will win in the end. </p>

<p>If you buy in to a theory/idea you should not be ashamed or angry when someone brings evidence to disprove it. You should be happy that you exist in a place where discussion and debate is allowed. </p>

<p>Bad ideas deserve to die. Don&#39;t bind your pride to one.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with ideologies and adhering to one but on this sub all that should matter is the truth.</p>

<p>What percentage of the regular users of this sub <em>claim</em> to care about the truth, but get rustled by those who question their beliefs?</p>

<p>It seems to me as though the saying about how &#39;belief is the enemy of truth&#39; is apt here.</p>

<p>For example, a lot of people seem to get upset at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ewvID-bUA">suggestion</a> that &#39;Kim Jong-un&#39; may be nothing more than a fictional boogeyman on our telescreens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t know their exact motives, but the point is to always keep some hot spots on the map running. Syria is obviously a lost cause now, ISIS is pretty much useless to them now, because Russians came in and ruined everything. So here comes NK, another sweet battleground to use US&#39;s vast arsenal on. The money flow into more defense contracts to get rid of NK, these contractors are very happy, certain politicians are handsomely paid. That&#39;s what it looks to me. Take taxpayers&#39; money, funnel into defense contracts, distill through the defense companies, pocket whatever comes out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say that. I&#39;m more of a conservative/libertarian and I will here a &quot;democrat&quot; out.  What I don&#39;t like is when this sub goes loopy over incorrect headlines and tries to drown out and logical discussion of the implications and if there is any.  Just with the recent Flynn deal from ABC, people were being immediately dismissed as delusional Trump supporters conducting mental gymnastics just for saying &quot;This was done during the transition and not during the campaign, is it even illegal or problematic?&quot;  People were saying they were spinning and just repeating their &quot;talking points&quot; or marching orders.   People were making it seam like anyone questioning whether or not this was actually a big deal were just insane and had their head so far up Trump&#39;s ass they refuse to see the truth.</p>

<p>No matter what is going on you can usually relay on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to at least have some logical discussions on it basically to desensitization whatever the media is reporting.  When you can&#39;t even ask &quot;Is this even illegal?&quot; or point out a very important fact like &quot;it was during the transition and not the campaign&quot; without being downvoted to oblivion or being dismissed as a blindly worshiping Trump supporter it can be pretty annoying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The clever division tactic seems to be too strong. There is now 2+ versions of truth depending on if you believe the corporate media or not. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s face it, the double truths all have to do with turning people against the president.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<p>Truth #1 Trump says he want to enforce the boarder laws. He has said this in many ways and has been taken out of context many times.</p>

<p>Truth #2 Trump is racist and hates foreigners and said all immigrants are rapists, that is why he won&#39;t let them in. </p>

<p>One side takes one as absolute truth, the other side takes the other as absolute truth. </p>

<p>The reality is one truth is from listening to what was said for your self. The other &quot;truth&quot; is from being told by the corporate media what was said. </p>

<p>Thus by deception 2 opposing &quot;truths&quot; exist at the same time.</p>

<p>This is just one example of the problem. </p>

<p>Alefantis, based on his instagram photos and comments, is a pedophile running a sex dungeon / pedophile ring out of his DC pizza shot.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Uh no it doesn&#39;t require the Pizza shop to have a sex dungeon or be the fucking headquarters of a pedophile ring. Why do you think this is remotely fucking required? Pizzagate is simply a small part of the global pedo network (Pedogate). The Pizza shop is probably just a meeting place for the pedos or for the ones who like to be &quot;out in the open&quot;. Not very complicated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Podesta emails, based on a list of code words sourced entirely from an unidentified source on 4chan,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pizza/Cheese I&#39;ve seen used myself years ago. So unless they literally time traveled then yea it&#39;s actually confirmed. The others haven&#39;t (I believe) been confirmed, Although they do make sense (like hotdog). And not all of the emails are using codewords. Quite a lot of them are just using straight up strange language.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>are a number of elderly people emailing constantly about fucking kids and keeping child sex slaves in their homes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea a bunch of elderly <em>Washington</em> <em>Elites</em> that fuck kids and keep child sex slaves in their homes. Not just normal elderly people. Your using extremely dishonest and manipulative language.  And yes for a pedo network theory to be true it does (Surprise surprise) require people to actually be fucking kids</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and not a bunch of elderly people making corny jokes and planning meals</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless their all mentally fucking challenged the language/jokes they used in the emails make no sense. Even for elderly people.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What the fuck are you saying? Pizzagate is simply the investigation into the Pizza shop/Podesta&#39;s circumstantial evidence that points into them being connected to a pedo network and Pedogate is everything else. Again using weird dishonest manipulative language.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact is, however, that this supposed &quot;law of logic&quot; is no such thing. As Steven D. Hales points in his paper &quot;You Can Prove a Negative,&quot; &quot;You can&#39;t prove a negative&quot; is a principle of folk logic, not actual logic.</p>

<p>Notice, for a start, that &quot;You cannot prove a negative&quot; is itself a negative. So, if it were true, it would itself be unprovable. Notice that any claim can be transformed into a negative by a little rephrasing—most obviously, by negating the claim and then negating it again. &quot;I exist&quot; is logically equivalent to &quot;I do not not exist,&quot; which is a negative. Yet here is a negative it seems I might perhaps be able to prove (in the style of Descartes—I think, therefore I do not not exist!)</p>

Someone on here might say I was actually masturbating furiously for 6 hours and fell asleep in a chair with my pants around my ankles.

<p>I&#39;m not surprised about this. There&#39;s been talk Reddit has been comprised for a long time now. </p>

<p>Actually, I have found that as soon as they comment from the original post, you can 90% guarantee they are shills and trolls. With that in mind, they are eating themselves, genuine readers know they are not there for rational discourse, so just 1. report them as soon as possible, 2. people get more woke.

I have always been extremely adept at identifying faces but thought my eyes could be deceiving me, so I conducted careful biometric analysis to see if my eyes were deceiving me, but the analysis showed instead that they indeed have the exact same face. I offered to send anyone that requested the video by PM, but no one asked and instead called crazy and downvoted to oblivion. It&#39;s like... 🙈</p>

looking at the pictures, they look similar.  you have to wonder though, if it is the same person... the balls on the people setting it up to use the same person for both instances is pretty out there and unlikely.  it&#39;d be nice to get them both in a room to unlock an iPhone X, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funnily enough my dissertation was related to face recognition. You are confused about prosopagnosia though, it&#39;s not really to do with matching faces, but more to do with not being able to recognise faces. People with severe prosopagnosia might not be able to recognise the faces of family and friends.</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re trolling I think you&#39;re really obsessed with this and you should probably just stop. It&#39;s retarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prosopagnosia also (obviously) applies to being unable to notice when you are seeing the face of a person you have already seen, such as when comparing two photos of the same person.</p>

<p>You can keep slinging ad hominems but it doesn&#39;t make you sound rational when you are denying what&#39;s right in front of your face. If your dissertation was on facial recognition then what happened in the mean time? Did you do a lot of drugs or something? I literally used multiple forms of facial recognition software and meticulous manual analysis to verify that these are the same individual and all you can say in your apparent expertise is &quot;that&#39;s retarded&quot;--how sophisticated of you.</p>

<p>You&#39;re denial and confidence despite any sort of rational counter-argument is quite honestly creepy AF. You need help or to meditate or something because at this point it&#39;s just bizarre.</p>

<p>Their mouths are exactly the same shape and width and is the exact same distance from the other metrics of her face---did you even watch the video? In case you didn&#39;t notice Susan bro is pursing her lips, otherwise the mouths are identical.</p>

<p>Regarding the nose---I&#39;m incredulous as to how you can say they are different in any way. Not only did I prove that the position and width of the nose is literally identical for each photo, but their noses even without measuring are clearly EXACTLY the same. They even both have a very slight downward slant to the right. How you can deny the nose is exactly the same is beyond me. Without a doubt it proves that you are deliberately obfuscating or are just very, very bad at analyzing facial features.</p>

<p>Look at the distance between the noses and the eyes between the first photo and the second? Did her nose slide down her face over the course of five years as well? Or did her eyes slide up her face?</p>

<p>In five years, she lost her under eye lines, lose the lines to the sides of her mouth, but gained lines between the sides of her nose and mouth? Did that come from her eyes changing position?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dood--in the photos you just showed me, Susan Bro is looking upward, while Donna Soto is looking downward. Hence why one&#39;s nose is upturned and the others is downward...basic shit.</p>

<p>&quot;The person is the first picture&#39;s nose is absolutely different. Much more wide set.&quot;</p>

<p>Unbelievable. I literally proved that their noses are the exact same width. Did you literally not watch the video? I&#39;ll make it easy for you and link to that exact part: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0UPGbPJ91Y#t=09m10s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0UPGbPJ91Y#t=09m10s</a></p>

<p>&quot;Person #1 has a wide chin, person #2 has a much narrower chin. aging does not affect your facial structure to that degree in five years.&quot;</p>

<p>No---again the chins are the exact same width. The only difference is Susan Bro&#39;s skin beneath her chin is understandably sagging a bit more. Not only does person two not have a &quot;much narrower&quot; chin, but her chin is literally not narrower. Are you just winging this? Or have you actually done the measurements? Because I have. I can update the video if you&#39;d like to show you this regarding the chins, since it wasn&#39;t explicitly included in my video. </p>

<p>&quot;Look at the distance between the noses and the eyes between the first photo and the second? Did her nose slide down her face over the course of five years as well? Or did her eyes slide up her face?&quot;</p>

<p>Again--this was in my video. The noses are literally in the exact same position relative to the eyes. Here&#39;s another convenient link to that timestamp:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I&#39;ve explained to many other people, though I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt since you may have missed those earlier exchanges, I normalized the size of the photos. </p>

<p>First of all, it&#39;s obvious that they are both looking straight at the camera--so I find the comments about the &quot;angle&quot; to be just strange. Are you telling me you cannot see they are looking straight at the camera?</p>

<p>Second of all, the distance is normalized by resizing one or both of the photos until the distance between one or more of the facial metrics match. Once an immutable facial metric matches (such as the distance between the eyes, then you can proceed to analyze the remaining metrics. At that point, non-identical individuals will start to have biometric measurements that diverge, whereas identical twins or the same individual will continue to have synchronous metric after synchronous measurement. Once you&#39;ve verified that all of the major facial landmarks are exact, then you know they are the same person, relatives that closely resemble each other, or twins. </p>

<p>This should be obvious. Just imagine how you would normalize the sizes of two photos of yourself looking directly at a camera--it is the same process I described above. I encourage you to try it for yourself with two photos of yourself with the camera at different distances away from your face.</p>

<p>So basically, your initial data that you based everything else on was your resizing one of the photos until the distance between their eyes matched? And you&#39;re surprised that you&#39;re finding other things now match?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Listen to what you are saying. Oh man, no offense but I didn&#39;t think people would be this, well, dumb.</p>

<p>What I described to you is literally the only way to normalize the size of the photos. It&#39;s not something I made up--it&#39;s literally the only way to do it!</p>

<p>BTW, I did not &quot;eyeball&quot; it, I took an exact measurement between the two eyes on each photo until they matched. In response to this you say:</p>

<p>&quot;Any measurements you take from that point are now flawed because your first data point was just something that you eyeballed until looked good for the rest of your conclusions.&quot;</p>

<p>...but that is very, very dumb. And I don&#39;t mean to say that because I think you are necessarily dumb. Just that as of right now you don&#39;t grasp the concept, so your current perspective is sounding dumb.</p>

<p>Think about it this way. If I were to compare two photos of two obviously different people, and before doing so I resized the photos until the distance between their eyes matched. After doing so, most if not all of the other measurements would be totally off. How is that not clear? The only way that the measurements would continue to be synchronous after that normalization process is if they are the same person...because the first normalizing measurement/resizing is the base measurement. It&#39;s like the control.</p>

<p>Yikes...I just don&#39;t know how to get through to people if you don&#39;t see this, the most basic component of comparing two photos. Its...just...so...obvious. That&#39;s why I encourage you to do the same with two photos of yourself taken from different distances from the camera. You will see very quickly if you do that to normalize the size of the photos you need to render one measurement synchronous. How can I make this more clear, lol?!</p>

<p>Since everyone is being so damn stubborn about this I ran the photos through a facial comparison API...check out the result...</p>

<p>This only works to &quot;normalize&quot; the photos if all human beings have the same amount of space between their eyes.</p>

<p>And beside that point, the distance between the eyes and the nose is not the same, and neither is the distance between the nose and the mouth. </p>

<p>It seems like some of the distances matched up, and you decided to use those numbers and throw away the ones that didn&#39;t match.</p>

<p>You literally do not get it! This is how you normalize two photos of the same person---if you do this and they are NOT the same person, then all the subsequent measurements will be totally off. If you cannot grasp this then you are a lost cause!</p>

Trump may not be your cup of tea, but if any president was ever going to blab on the big conspiracies, I would put my money on Trump.</p>

<p>A man-made catastrophic event is happening right now. Its a purge of power and oligarchy. Trump is the saviour of humanity. He has put the corruption and crimes of humanity in the spotlight. He will go down too but that is because he is the epitome. He is a fucked up Jesus. He is an accelerant of evolution. He is helping us realize our complacency and greed. We had no reason to act until the very of fabric of society was being threatened. Regardless of what his sycophants say about how society is broken, it was much more broken before and we have been getting better but he points out the serious flaw of the system that turn us into a leaf instead of a branch in time but we will persist because of diversity. Evolution is amazing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s pretty nutty, but I saw this posted on here a little while back and really liked it. I absolutely despise Trump. But I do believe that (if we can get through these next ~4 years) we will be much better off as a society in the long run than if Hillary were to have won. He&#39;s exposing how fucked up our society truly is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d change one thing in what you said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This sub should care about the <del>truth</del> facts and nothing else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The truth is subjective, bent by our personal biases and perceptions. In essence, it is what a conspiracy is born from; our perceptions seeing what lies beyond what we are told. Our ability and <em>need</em> to see beyond the narratives and explanations to find the facts.</p>

<p>Truth is what bends science into ideology; it takes the emotional need for explanation, for our desire to know why and rejects what disproves our suppositions in favor of delusions that uphold what we cling to. Of this, I have seen more in this sub than anything else.</p>

<p>2+2 will always insist, invariably, that it equals 4. It is to this that we must resolve the inconsistencies in the official explanations, the taking of 2+2&#39;s that we are told equal 4, but upon examination, we learn are 3&#39;s masquerading as 4&#39;s and exposing them for the frauds that they are.</p>

<p>If anything, we should be taking the &quot;truth&quot; and stripping away the lies to find the facts, if any exist at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the first time they used such a tactic to make people think someone was the good guy. A perfect example of this was the Aldrich bill, aka the Federal Reserve Act. After the Aldrich bill failed because people saw it for what it was (a bill by bankers for bankers), they created a huge propaganda effort, even paying economists at universities and such, to cry about how much the Fed act would &quot;hurt the banks&quot;, etc. The people bought it, thinking &quot;If it&#39;s bad for the banks it must be good for us!&quot;, and that&#39;s how we got the fed.</p>

<p>You are falling into a trap, being played. It&#39;s ok though, we&#39;ve all fallen for their tactics at some point or another. So please, don&#39;t be so quick to tell someone else to think for themselves, when it&#39;s you who needs to think for yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there is a lot of time wasted on disinformation, and there is a lot of argument over stupid things. While it may not be fair, or in the spirit of this post, I&#39;m pretty sure most of this sub can agree to just ignore the flat earthers. Also, if someone is arguing a point that you think is wrong, throw some evidence out there. If they claim bullshit, ignore them. </p>

<p>If someone is throwing out ad homs to your backed up claim, they are just trying to start a flame was to distract everyone. So, yeah, don&#39;t argue with the people who are insulting you, and don&#39;t argue with the people who are throwing out disinformation. Ignore or downvote and move on.</p>

looking at the pictures, they look similar.  you have to wonder though, if it is the same person... the balls on the people setting it up to use the same person for both instances is pretty out there and unlikely.  it&#39;d be nice to get them both in a room to unlock an iPhone X, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite common for people to loom &quot;the same&quot; ? How does that apply to my analysis? I identified at least 10 IDENTICAL metrics.  If you think random people on the street regularly share this degree of similarity then I&#39;m sorry but you have prosopognasia. </p>

<p>&quot;Measuring some lines in photoshop isn&#39;t &#39;careful biometric analysis&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>I am not &quot;measuring some lines&quot; I measured and matched exact facial synchronicities. Clearly you are unaware of how facial recognition software was developed. You should get that prosopognasia looked into, compadre.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly what I&#39;m talking about. People upvote this comment indiscriminately. But that&#39;s the issue, most people are not good at distinguishing faces, which is why I took it upon myself to make this analysis. To help people to see what I see, as I&#39;ve always been preternaturally good at identifying and distinguishing between faces. Essentially I have never though anyone looked substantially the same unless they were identical twins and even then I can always distinguish between the two after I am initially introduced to them. Take it or leave it (looks like most are opting for the latter...so it goes.)</p>

<p>Second of all, the distance is normalized by resizing one or both of the photos until the distance between one or more of the facial metrics match. Once an immutable facial metric matches, such as the distance between the eyes, then you can proceed to analyze the remaining metrics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically, your initial data that you based everything else on was your resizing one of the photos until the distance between their eyes matched? And you&#39;re surprised that you&#39;re finding other things now match?</p>
