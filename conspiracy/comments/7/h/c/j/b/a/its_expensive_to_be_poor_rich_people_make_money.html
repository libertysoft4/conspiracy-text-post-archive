    <div class="md"><p>The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer
And in the final hour many heads will lose power
What does the rich versus the poor really mean?
Psychologically it means you got to pick your team
When someone says the rich gets richer
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture
The rich get richer, cause they work towards rich
The poor get poorer, cause their minds can&#39;t switch from the ghetto</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My ex wife has scarcity mentality. She, specifically, used to over buy food and it ended up going bad. I lived with it, so don&#39;t you dare call me an idiot or delusional. We we&#39;re on food stamps and welfare for a time. We had periods where we had food and we&#39;re fine, then times it was tough. She had issues not having enough food growing up and it stuck. Even once we were doing better financially, she would stock up on food to the point the bottom half of our freezer was freezer burnt/wasted food almost all year round. So, screw your egotistical notions, jackass. There are people in this county who suffer regularly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it starts with the premise that everything is made of energy... Money is no different if you think of it as a sort of green energy. Humans are very capable of working with the energy all around us, but it takes a complete change of the way you think if you grew up with a scarcity mentality, i.e., there is never enough. Scarcity mentality is believing there is only so much to go around which is not the case at all. The universe is actually quite abundant, there is more than enough to go around. When you grow up poor, you are always being told that there isn&#39;t enough. You end up chasing low paying jobs working for someone else to just get by instead of trying things like starting your own business and being your own boss. A scarcity mentality makes you scared to break out of the box of your family programming, fear of scarcity keeps you quite limited. There is lots of reading out there on this subject, some mentioned in this thread. Even a book like Rich Dad Poor Dad... the idea that poor people are always chasing cash whereas others chase assets, it&#39;s a totally different mind set. One that you yourself can create and change. </p>

It doesn&#39;t matter how much you make, it matters how much you have. So, I pay $800/month rent but that&#39;s really cheap, I&#39;m just renting a room. If I wanted to get a 1 bedroom apt it&#39;d be around $1500/m.

<p>Could you afford your rent, 1 pack of smokes every day, and 4 energy drinks every day, plus have some money left over? Because maybe you can&#39;t afford what I spend on that stuff, but I live in a high cost of living area where everything costs more, the $20/hr I make isn&#39;t a great wage here; I might qualify as the very bottom of lower middle class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say I was in poverty, I said I was broke due to budgeting issues; of course the only difference between them is it would be quicker and easier for me to improve my situation, otherwise there isn&#39;t much noticeable difference: at the end of the day I get and spend more money, but I don&#39;t have anything to show for it because almost everything I buy is consumable; in fact growing up in low income housing there were a lot of Mexican families there and I&#39;d go over to my friends apartments, and even though those people probably made less than I do now, they were much better off than I am now. They budgeted and shopped for deals, bought real food rather than packaged stuff and always had delicious home cooked meals, but not everyone around there was like that.</p>

<p>So my point was in response to robaloie saying &quot;Poor people can’t afford the nice products so they buy the cheap ones that break faster so they end up having to buy more of the same cheap product&quot;, and I countered with they can do it, but it takes ingenuity, sacrifice, will power, brains, and especially be aware of programs meant to help you(welfare). </p>

<p>Like say nowadays cheap microwaves have planned obsolescence built in and you need to buy a new one every year as a poor person. Waste of money, just like Vimes boot theory. So you should buy the expensive model that will last longer, that way you won&#39;t have to replace it as often; <em>or</em> at a Thrift Store or garage sale buy one of the old ones that not only run forever but also work much better than modern ones, buy a little tool kit, and when it breaks learn how to fix it on Youtube. Boom, you just spent less than the shitty model costs for a microwave that will last at least 10x longer than the expensive one! Set aside the money you saved. Keep doing that sort of thing every time you see an opportunity, keep socking the money away. </p>

<p>After a year or two not only will you have a nice little chunk of change saved up, you won&#39;t have anymore upcoming expenses like you used to; take that money and invest it in an index fund. Keep adding to it with the money you would have spent on your yearly microwave and whatever else. That index fund will go up 3-6% quarterly, even when we have a recession the overall economy still grows albeit slower, and you&#39;re invested in a little piece of every company on the stock market, so your ETF will match the market&#39;s growth. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s how a poor person could claw their way out of the cycle.</p>

<p>Without Capitalism most of these people would be dead or never born in the first place. </p>

<p>Historically in societies that value labor people who don&#39;t or cannot contribute to the economy and society are killed or left for dead. </p>

<p>Capitalism is the only economic system that allows for millions of people to exist and survive in a society while not producing or contributing to the overall good of the society. </p>

<p>So in almost every other human society, and every animal system. If you don&#39;t produce, you would have to either 100% take care of all your personal needs, want&#39;s, and desires, or you die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, I don&#39;t want to go too far from my home. My parents are worried about me cause I have asthma and food allergies, which I can understand. I have like a 4.0 GPA, 4.2 UC GPA, so I&#39;m just applying to UCs. By some will of God, I scored a 36 on the act, so I&#39;m not retaking it even though I got a 9 on the essay :V. </p>

<p>My sister also applied to ivies with high everything and got rejected, so if I* really* want to go, I think I&#39;ll just transfer in once I improve my track record. I&#39;ve never had all A&#39;s until last year, so I won&#39;t stand a chance against my classmates, some of which are still applying to ivies. </p>

<p>I hear the Haas school of business at UC Berkeley is also good for econ, and that&#39;s what my sister did, but she says those jobs have no room for personal growth. I&#39;m probably going to major in math or computer science, and get one more degree based on whatever field is hot at the moment. Thanks for the advice, by the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it is not their fault if they are born poor. Just because people are born poor, doesn&#39;t mean other people should be forced to be born with less money. But they have years to fix it. It is unfortunate for people to be born into a poor family, but I think this is a reason people should think more philosophically in general. Would it be moral to have a kid knowing they will have to be poor? Many people that are poor or borderline living paycheck to paycheck are not just stuck there against their will.  I think people can control more than they think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely agree. A study was done that found most rich people (net assets over $1,000,000) are just average joes living In middle class neighborhoods who live frugally and own small businesses that they founded. Most people who inherit money end up losing it within 3 generations. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about making sacrifices and working hard. Save your money and put all your effort into bettering yourself. Whether you start a business or work in retail, nothing is stopping you from being driven and willing to take initiative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m poor, the reason I&#39;m poor is I bought dumb shit. Never really saved my income.Now once again jobless because of my own inabilities. At least now I can blame the actual problem which is me. My thinking, the way I don&#39;t respect money because I look down upon it, view as an evil thing. Money is just a tool, can&#39;t be evil. Yet some how I was lead to this conclusion. Might have been from the TV, might have been from my peers, or just from my parent. I don&#39;t know. But I know I came to the wrong conclusion. After some introspection my lack of respect for money, my lack of knowledge or rather willingness to balance my budget is the problem. But at the same time it doesn&#39;t end there. My habits, the way I consume things is the problem. The way I can only see the problems in my surroundings and not my own is a problem. The problem I make excuses instead of changes is the problem. </p>

<p>TO be honest I don&#39;t know how to change or where to start, but I know I need to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, just start putting a tiny bit away. Like 10 bucks a week. Sell off the high-ticket stuff you bought &amp; use the money, but put like anything into savings. Ditch your bank account and get up with a credit union which if free, but requires you to keep like 5 bucks in savings. When you get a job, go ahead and get direct deposit &amp; have a tiny percent deposited directly into savings. If you find you have a couple bucks left over from the previous pay period, come payday, go ahead and transfer that into savings too. Keep doing that forever until you have $500 in savings. Don&#39;t touch that money. Keep working &amp; adding to that no-spend account. </p>

<p>Go thru your belongings &amp; do a major cull. Get rid of everything you haven&#39;t used or worn in the past year. Donate it. Get it to someone poorer than you and do it with a grateful mindset. </p>

<p>File your taxes. Take every bit of the money (even if it&#39;s 3 bucks) you don&#39;t need &amp; sock it into savings. </p>

<p>Cook food at home, buy rice in bulk, get some seeds &amp; pots and start a salsa garden outside or near a sunny window. Take care of that shit &amp; freeze anything you can&#39;t eat right away. Give any over that to neighbors or friends. Don&#39;t eat out til you feel wealthy - not even fast food. </p>

<p>Cut your utilities &amp; electronics to nada. You can live off just your phone. Don&#39;t add luxury utilities back until you can afford to eat out. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t even think of credit. Make it your goal to become a zero credit score. Carry cash only. Pack food &amp; water. Know that you have that spending cap &amp; if you need food, a drink, whatever beyond what you&#39;re carrying - you&#39;ll have to get your ass home before you can have it. </p>

<p>Make this happen as a form of self respect. It&#39;s massive suckage to be poor. Do everything you can possibly think of to keep that from being your norm. </p>

<p>Hang in there, friend. Money is not evil, but being poor sure as fuck is. </p>

<p>Another option for investing in real estate with a low cost of entry is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_investment_trust">REIT&#39;s</a>, or Real Estate Investment Trusts, it&#39;s just like buying stock, but instead of a company that makes products you&#39;re investing in a company that buys and sells real estate such as houses, apartment buildings, hospitals etc. So instead of buying a house, you&#39;d be buying a fraction of multiple different properties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve found literally forcing myself to do things especially when I&#39;m feeling like you, that I feel so glad I got off my ass and did XYZ. I&#39;m in the same situation and understand where your coming from. Changing yourself isn&#39;t easy if you don&#39;t really want to change. Sometimes finding something worth being motivated for is a good tactic too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Among other books, the Dave Ramsey total money make over changed our lives. Wife and I in 2005 were 22-24 trying to &quot;play life&quot;.  Bought a house , had a kid, went into other debt and did other stupid stuff. By 2007-2008 we were going backwards $200-500 every month just to exist. </p>

<p>I had enough one day and read the book, listened to stories of people who sacrificed a few years of thier lives to live on rice and beans and maybe work 2-3 jobs.  We eventually came out of it and started paying cash for the things we bought, through those years of hard work a business blossomed and eventually supported us. </p>

<p>We&#39;re still learning, few of us arrive , but there is hope.   With that said, even today is different, automation will be taking over more and more jobs.  If you&#39;re willing to work harder than anyone else you&#39;ll do ok.  That&#39;s really all any company wants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m poor and can relate with you on how you don&#39;t know how to change it. Have been below poverty-level my entire life, but when I was a kid, I didn&#39;t realize we were what society considered &quot;poor&quot; since my parents always worked 12hr days and provided for us--we never went without.</p>

<p>When I became an adult and had my child (I&#39;m a single mother and now 30yo), I worked minimum wage jobs until I got into college. I went for 2 1/2yrs, then a vast number of circumstances occurred with the program and my loans, and I was advised to drop out and re-enroll. 
I dropped, then they told me I couldn&#39;t re-enroll until I paid off what I owed the college itself. </p>

<p>That was five years ago. 
I plan on going back as soon as I&#39;m able to pay them off, but I&#39;ve been unemployed since Sept, and have always been a penny-pincher. But, I live in a small rural town in TN. Little work is available, I drive a 1990 Tempo that&#39;s on its last legs, but I&#39;ve put in at LEAST 100 apps in surrounding towns. </p>

<p>Not a single call back or email. I&#39;ve contacted them, but they haven&#39;t replied. 
And since I don&#39;t have a degree (although I attended long enough to be at the same educational level as an Associate&#39;s degree, esp since I took many business courses--it still doesn&#39;t count), no one even wants to interview me. My boyfriend and I have a plan(he is publishing his 5-book series), but said plan will not kick in until next fall, so that will at least help to get us on our feet. </p>

<p>I know it may sound mundane or ridiculous and I&#39;m not going to make this into a religious/spiritual post, but I have the utmost faith that my family will come out on top, and those who fight for their place in this world will as well. I have to believe things will get better, it&#39;s all I know how to do anymore.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m just trying to learn how to survive until then, and let me tell you, I&#39;ve been so broke that I didn&#39;t have a phone or hot water or a vehicle(at the same time) and was then kicked out of my old house, but now it feels more <em>real</em> than it did then. I guess it&#39;s because of the reality of my age (I&#39;m not getting any younger) and the fact I have no way of investing any money, and just barely being able to pay basic bills is scaring the crap out of me since I don&#39;t want to get evicted. I don&#39;t ever want to relive the horror of that experience again.</p>

<p>Chin up, buddy. We are virtually in the same boat, but different circumstances. Back when I was 20-22, I had to learn how to cut back on my spending by not going out and only buying necessities and shopping at the thrift store for clothing. It can be done. <em>We can</em> get out of this mess. There were a few books mentioned on here, I&#39;m going to check them out to see if they help. In the meantime, I&#39;m just going to keep looking for a job until next year. That&#39;s the only way I know how to change my current circumstances, and through knowledge, I know we both can learn how to adapt and thrive in the future. </p>

<p>We cannot do it overnight. Just look at it as a work in progress. We may never become millionaires, and I honestly don&#39;t want to be. All I want is to get to a point where we aren&#39;t struggling, BUT if given the tools and resources through knowledge and the willpower to continue, you and I both will be light-years away from where we are today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for such a lengthy and heart felt response. It illicit a reaction in me to write. And I&#39;d like the share the product of that inspiration with you. A message I was able to write to myself, and now share with you and others that care to read. </p>

<p>Seek to find your self within yourself and you will find that in which you seek. But look to find yourself in the sea of others and you will forever be searching. When You say you are searching for yourself, this thing means nothing. For you have gone no where. You are you and will always be you. The actions you do, are just a part of you. But doesn’t equate to being you. There is no predefined version of you. No other can define you. </p>

<p>You are the sole person who can define yourself. So if you think yourself incapable then you will be so. If you think yourself worthless then it shall be. If you can shape the way you view yourself and there by so doing it will shape your reality. So do not ponder too hard on past mistakes. For there are lessons in mistakes but if you don’t not heed the lessons you are bound to repeat them. The guilt will compound and you will begin to hold ill views on yourself. So look at the mistakes in your life and see which keep popping up time and time again. Why do they keep reoccurring what lesson have you not learned? Kind of a riddle huh? But truly you are the only one who can teach yourself to change. No other can correct your mistakes. You, the individual you the awareness. You. If you ignore this fact then you are destine to not elevate yourself. You will forever be ignoring your own problems. </p>

<p>You’ve nothing  in your way, so do some good stop being an asshole and feeling sorry. Start being and stop feeling. Start accepting that which you are. Be concise in the manner of which you up hold yourself.  Change your ways. Become yourself. Stop being what you think you should be, stop being what you think others want you to be. And just be. Just be yourself. You can’t be anything but that. So have faith in the things you do. If you are doing things you feel guilty about perhaps it isn’t something you really want to be doing in the first place. Correct the behavior that leads to self hate. </p>

<p>Learn to communicate and be present in the now. Don’t retract yourself from the present moment when others are speaking, make eye contact and listen. You hide your gaze because you lack that ability to be grounded in the now. SO just do it. You will be able to follow the conversation more easily and understand it more fully. Bring your awareness to all situations. This is your life you should be present in the moments of it. IF you have your mind to far in the past or to ahead in the future you aren’t going to be  present for what is happening now. The things you do now are the seeds of the future. So if you remain present in the now you will be able to create that future and design it along each step. </p>

<p>So how do you bring yourself out to the present moment? How can you do this? I mean you’ve been stuck in the past for so long, or so worried about your future or lack there of. That you haven’t even addressed what is right be fore you. You need to address it. No more putting it off, no more excuses or tomorrow. Because the fact of the matter is it is today. You are here right now. You can do something about it right now. SO why aren’t you? There is no valid excuse. Only things you accept, because it aligns with your thoughts. But you need to change the way you think. You need to be productive. You need to be proactive. Stop being reactive. You wait for things to happen instead of making things happen. Why? Seriously why do you not take action. You are afraid. You are afraid  but why? It will make life so much easier than it is now. Yet you refuse. You refuse because you have no faith in yourself. You don’t believe you can do it. Why? Who brought you down? Oh right you brought yourself down. Who can bring you backup? Who has to be the one to do it? You? Yes that is who. </p>

<p>SO rise up out of the self hate and pity. You need some self love and respect. You are alive. You made some mistakes and you understand that those mistakes are yours. This is a positive this a great thing in life. You have the opportunity to change your life now. You just have to start. If you don’t start it will never happen. If you choose to ignore your problems continue to push it off on others and on circumstance then you will never change your life. This is true to anyone of any standing. Things change because of action, that action is backed by will. And it is in that essence our will can manifest reality. If you lack the will, then you will never be able to bring about the world in which you wish to see. You could only hope that another might envision something similar. You will critique it because it isn’t exactly how you want it to be. So why not try to enact your vision of the world. You know that you’ve a good heart and your vision of the world isn’t to see it burn. So try to bring it about. But if you do nothing You will be nothing, Your world will never look the way in which you want it to look and you will be bitter because of it. SO stop doing nothing, start doing something. You want to bring about change you want this world to be different well than do something about it. Because I guarantee nobody else is going to have your vision of the world but you. They might share aspects of your world. But it wont be the same. SO bring about that inner world that is in your mind. Share it with others. Let people be able to expand it.</p>

<p>That is the end of it. Thank you for the inspiration. Might just be babbling but needed to get it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s expensive to be poor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it is. It&#39;s not just a lack of money that screws poor people. It&#39;s the fact that there are myriad fees on being poor, from late payment fees to high interest rates.</p>

<p>Poor people generally can&#39;t afford regular doctor visits, so their health suffers to the point where serious medical intervention is necessary, which is very expense. If the poor people can&#39;t pay to keep themselves alive, they go into extreme debt. Their credit suffers, which makes getting a car or a job or an apartment/house much more difficult.</p>

<p>Society would benefit if we helped keep the poor afloat so that in their desperation they don&#39;t turn to crime, as well.</p>

<p>Automation is increasingly making low-skill jobs scarce that would ordinarily be available to poor people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t stand the camp of homeless people that has popped up suddenly in my neighborhood. They are disgusting. They use to come to the gas station where I work and use our bathroom to use and hide their drugs and drug paraphernalia, use our parking lot as a meeting place to buy and/or sell drugs, harass our customers for money, or just harass any and everyone because they are fucking tweeting hard and often become violent. We, the employees, have done what we could to stop them from stepping foot on the premises by calling the police and having them trespasses. </p>

<p>I wish there was more that could be done to flush them out of the neighborhood for good though. They leave trash everywhere, piss and shit everywhere, constantly beg and harass people for money and/or drugs, or they are currently on drugs and have become paranoid everyone is out to get them. When that happens, it&#39;s scary. It&#39;s happened to me a few times. Minding my own business and then suddenly a dirty, drugged up homeless person gets in my face threatening to kill me because they believe I want to kill them or whatever. And it&#39;s not like you can talk these people down to a calmer state of mind. They steal from surrounding businesses and are destructive. </p>

<p>These homeless people don&#39;t want help to get off the streets. It&#39;s becoming a trend and keeps getting worse. And it makes it very difficult for the true homeless that want and need help. But because you got these ever increasing camps of homeless people that want nothing more to get high and harass people and are dirty and disgusting, I, and a bunch of other people, now ignore any and all homeless people seen on the streets. I&#39;m sick of stepping over their shit, getting harassed, putting up with their drug fueled paranoia, picking up after them, chasing them off private property, constantly having to watch my back wherever I go, and listening to their fake sob stories to emotionally manipulate people to give them money. </p>

<p>They need to go. </p>

Now no matter what night of the week it is, you can expect to see massive amounts of drug addicts in the same areas.

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of it depends on the location of the shelters. For instance, Jacksonville has homeless shelters downtown where it is easy for them to panhandle by day and have the opportunity for food and shelter at night. They congregate there and it gets quite sketchy after dark. Tallahassee has most of them way out to the west side so downtown doesn&#39;t get bogged down. </p>

<p>Sarcasm and your very black and white view of the world aside, it&#39;s hard for me to see your point of view.  Opiates got pushed on the masses, and not even close to cannabis. You see the two as addicts, I see you as uninformed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who knows about the so called &quot;opioid epidemic&quot;, which is really just escapism and drug seeking behavior.  Or anyone who knows that doctors get a kickback from narcotic suppliers for prescribing their drugs.  </p>

<p>Last year, I broke my right foot, and the pain was immense.  The GP gave me 4 Oxys to hold me until I could see the specialist (1.5 days later, yay non-socialized medicine!) and after taking the first, I had had enough.  It was better to hurt than to feel disconnected from your body.  </p>

<p>When the ortho doctor offered me 6 WEEKS of oxys I actually asked him if he was a real doctor.  I requested tramidols instead, and stopped taking them after about 2 weeks.  Yea, it hurt, and I&#39;m not super man, so I was a baby about it, but it was better than some doctor getting me hooked on faux-heroin and then keeping me as a &quot;pain clinic patient&quot; until I die, or graduate to real-heroin.  </p>

You can&#39;t, unless you are educated on it ahead of the time you are in a car accident, or start having chronic pain that doesn&#39;t let you work.

    <div class="md"><p>This just represents that the problem is on both sides. Why the hell should a doctor give anyone oxys for a broken foot? These were drugs designed for cancer patients with extreme pain, but now they are being handed out for the simplest things. There are so many weaker drugs he could have given you, why start all the way near the top of the pain killer chart? Probably because he&#39;s so used to people coming and asking for oxys that he just prescribes them now anyway, figuring thats what people just take now. Most addicts know they are addicts and go out seeking the drugs. The doctors may make it easier to get them, but the people are the ones pushing for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can say that its a combination of whats happening in USA right now. Abuse of H1B visas to bring in educated foreign workers at lower wages, due to high taxes in USA and highly competitve global market, mainly from Asia, illegal invaders from South America taking low education jobs and social programs that literally cut North Amwrican citizens out of what few jobs that might be available.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Americans don&#39;t want to do that work. By and large we&#39;re too lazy.  When Alabama started enforcing no hiring of illegal immigrants the crops they had rotted in the fields.  How many Americans will go work 8 hours or more a day in the heat, picking fruit for .75 cents a barrel?</p>

<p>Our agricultural industry is built on cheap, illegal labor.  But they will do it as they have nothing in their home country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I should have quoted the section &quot;illegal invaders from South America taking low education jobs&quot;  to show that I was referencing that.</p>

<p>What you mention is something that is abused. Companies go through loopholes, like placing ad&#39;s in tiny circulation papers, to show that they intend to hire American, then remove them and use H1B&#39;s.</p>

<p>That is definitely an issue. And one that I feel needs to be fixed. Not just in IT, (and I&#39;m marginally employed in that at the moment) but in hospitality and certain finance institutions.</p>

<p>But we also need to get more detailed and competitive education standards in our country. So we can compete against them in our global economy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard that some kids can now take programming classes in school, which sounds incredible to hear but it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to have kids developing apps as senior projects, and hopefully a few can hit it big.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, the H1B visa program needs to be ended, and replaced with absolutely nothing. </p>

<p>The only reason H1B is &quot;necessary&quot; is because employers <em>CHOOSE</em> not to compete on pay/benefits.</p>

<p>They are refusing to engage the employment marketplace as it stands, choosing instead to lobby congress to get a &quot;cheaper option&quot; - so they don&#39;t have to increase the wages they are paying Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Poor people pay high interest not because bankers are greedy, but because poor people often don&#39;t pay off loans. Therefore, they are charged a risk premium for borrowing money. This isn&#39;t mean, cruel or exploitative. It&#39;s just business. If banks did not charge high interest premiums for loans to poor people (or were prohibited by legislation) then lending to poor people would not be profitable and no one--NO ONE--would put their money at risk lending to poor people. Then poor people would truly be fucked when they needed credit.</p>

<p>As for turning to crime, this is another example of short-term thinking. Don&#39;t have money? Why study and invest in yourself when you can just take money from someone? Won&#39;t that piss them off? Who cares? I might not get caught. Win for me! Crime is the ultimate self-indulgent short-term stupidity.</p>

<p>I used to be poor. I used to really resent the high interest rates. Now I have more money than I need (for the short-term) and a crazy high credit score. Banks compete to loan money to me by offering lower and lower interest rates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best way I&#39;ve ever heard it described was in Terry Pratchett&#39;s Discworld book, Men at Arms:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.</p>

<p>Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.</p>

<p>But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that&#39;d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years&#39; time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.</p>

<p>This was the Captain Samuel Vimes &#39;Boots&#39; theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”</p>

<p>I see most of my friends buying brand new range rovers, and getting insane mortgages for houses to show off. It&#39;s the materialism ego that keeps them in great debt. Then they think they&#39;re hot shit because they&#39;re willing to borrow more money from the bank.

<p>If they don&#39;t pay on time, you kick them out. I&#39;ve done it, it&#39;s not a big deal. As for the other costs, you use the capital from the rent to save up for that stuff.

<p>Costs can arise in any business venture. Of course there are risks involved. If everyone always took the easy way, accumulation of wealth would be non existent. I guess you think I should just slave away at a 9 to 5 hey. </p>

<p>I have no reason to lie. Ive been investing in real estate now for 6 years, is that long enough for your standards? In that time I&#39;ve accumulated alot of wealth that I&#39;d otherwise not have. I could sell it all right now and pay off my house and still have some left over, and I&#39;m in my early 30s. How many people who started with zero can say that? An overwhelming majority of people never pay off their mortgage. So for you to say real estate is a bad investment is fucking laughable to me.

    <div class="md"><p>I was poor once. I worked hard and now I have a nice home, nest egg, and yes, my money is making me money in mutual funds and equities. About 34 years ago, when I was dirt poor living in a rooming house, I had an awakening. I realized that there is no separation between me and my experience, and that I could create experience through mental and physical action. I learned how to hold a vision in my mind, and then take action towards manifesting it. I believe we all have this power. I think it&#39;s best to empower rather than create things that essentially tell the poor that there is no way out. Sure there is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being self made today vs 30 years ago is a completely different journey, much due to rapidly increasing scarcity, and the rich basically holding a monopoly as an aggregate. For example, housing is skyrocketing in Northern California; I went to an open house in prospect of maybe buying a house to live in and start a family. But, I got there, and its a dozen other people throwing around the weight of money they&#39;ve already made off investment properties, to then buy this property, turn around and rent it for $1k+ on top of the mortgage cost to those who aren&#39;t able to penetrate into the &quot;homeowners club&quot;.</p>

Owning a home is likely for almost anyone, if they hold the vision and act towards it. It takes continuous action, and also being open to opportunities that present themselves. I don&#39;t believe in scarcity, and also don&#39;t present that picture or belief system to other people&#39;s minds. </p>

<p>The capacity of the average person, starting from nothing, to be &quot;self made&quot; is <em>completely</em> different from thirty years ago. If you&#39;d like evidence, <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2015/sep/pdf/bu-0915-3.pdf">here</a>&#39;s some longitudinal research about housing affordability vs CPI in my country, and <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2017/mar/pdf/bu-0317-2-insights-into-low-wage-growth-in-australia.pdf">here</a> are some data about wage growth. </p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to argue that things are &quot;the same as 30 years ago&quot; then you&#39;re more than welcome, but the evidence is against you and I think you&#39;d have a pretty tough row to hoe. Why not actually engage with the economic data, rather than just spouting platitudes? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What make you think I&#39;m at the top? I have many friends with whom I grew up with in lower to middle class families that now own homes, have money in the bank, and who have <em>created</em> nice lives for themselves and their families. None of us are <em>elite</em> or part of the 1% that people vilify so much. I don&#39;t buy into the narrative that everyone but that 1% are somehow impoverished and living horrible lives void of creativity, love, adventure, fun, etc...in some dark Orwellian nightmare in which we&#39;re all oppressed by a group of fascists, leaving us without any freedom. I don&#39;t buy it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve <em>created</em> my life to be what it is through imagination and action, and being frugal and not getting in debt. For the last 34 years I&#39;ve dedicated myself to living in a creative orientation, not a reactive one. I don&#39;t worry about money because I didn&#39;t spend more than I made. I lived within my means, and invested the extra in safe vehicles available to anyone. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all quite simple. You get what you focus on, and your beliefs about yourself and the world shape your life and are usually the limiting factors in terms of your imagination and vision-making and actions. If I believe in an Orwellian nightmare in which everyone but the so-called 1% has no chance to <em>create</em> a rewarding, worthwhile life, then I most likely will <em>create</em> that world and live accordingly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a great disservice to others to try to make them believe that they have no chance in life. That the limitations are so great they can never have a fulfilling life. Rather, if one really wants to create a different world, then one should dedicate one&#39;s self to waking people up to their creative powers. To the vast pool of creative energy available to them in the present. Which is very real. There is no space between me and my experience. No separation. I&#39;m responsible for most of what I experience due to action or inaction.</p>

<p>We all have the power to create experience. Every one of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not special. That&#39;s my point. This creative power is available to everyone. What&#39;s so lucky about making good decisions? That power is available to me and everyone. What&#39;s so lucky about saving up to buy a home? </p>

<p>When I was poor, after I had left home, and was struggling, I didn&#39;t realize the power of my actions. I was asleep. I made poor decision after poor decision. I stayed poor because of them. I stayed messed up on alcohol because of my decisions. I stayed lonely because of how I treated people. I stayed poor because I spent more money than I made, which there is only one way to do that: debt. No one can save money if they&#39;re paying more for a dollar than a dollar can make in some kind of interest-bearing investment vehicle.</p>

<p>After my awakening, and taking responsibility for my current experience, the world I had created, I moved forth in a creative manner with a vision, one step at a time, keeping a moral and ethical framework. This ability to act is available to everyone.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy the 99 out of 100 perception and belief system that some hold. Millions and millions of people create good lives for themselves, because they took responsibility for their experiences and took action in the present that made that reality more probable. They might not be millionaires, as I am not one, but they live good lives. Should I as a 58 year old tell a youngster that they have no chance, that this is all a random crapshoot, and if you aren&#39;t lucky, you&#39;ll always be poor? No. Because it&#39;s not true. To do so would be irresponsible. My words are actions. My actions create waves. Why would I want to create a wave of despair?</p>

<p>I find that there are many posts that try to solidify the belief that we are all oppressed and that the answer is to go to some kind of war with the 1% or anyone who is rich, instead of looking to one&#39;s self and shifting to a creative orientation in which one takes the responsibility in creating a new experience for themselves. It&#39;s my responsibility to speak to something completely different that is actually real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, you keep saying I&#39;m special due to your own perception and belief. I haven&#39;t said that, especially when I&#39;ve written that millions of others have gone from little money to eventually owning a home and having a good life. They understand vision and creative action---millions and millions understand this--all a person has to do is look around and see this--someone is living in all those millions of homes. </p>

<p>A poor person <em>can</em> stop being poor. It happens all the time. Why would I ever write something that basically says that a poor person is trapped forever in their current experience, when I know it isn&#39;t true?</p>

<p>If I were to go up to a poor person and say &quot;don&#39;t even try. There is no way out,&quot; it would be a violation on my part as it is an attempt to keep someone asleep to their own powers of vision and creative action--to keep them poor. It&#39;s one of the worst things a person can do to another--to make them believe that the limitations are so great that they should give up on themselves and just do nothing about it. </p>

<p>“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.</p>

<p>Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.</p>

<p>But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that&#39;d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years&#39; time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.</p>

<p>This was the Captain Samuel Vimes &#39;Boots&#39; theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”</p>

Unless you hit the lotto or are a billionaire, you&#39;re probably getting loans for things like cars and houses still.

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s pretty much how life works. It&#39;s called &quot;compounding&quot; in economics and it results in the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. It&#39;s why 100% free market capitalism doesn&#39;t work nor libertarianism. Poor guy can be more talented and harder working than rich kid but if rich kid doesn&#39;t have to work or struggle to survive he&#39;s going to go a lot further in life unlike poor guy who has to work 2 jobs to pay rent. </p>

<p>In Australia we have a lot of old people who got wealthy off of booming real estate. Unlike millennials, the baby boomers had easy access to large houses on decent sized blocks close to the city 50 years ago but today those same houses cost millions of dollars. The oldies now have the capital to invest and buy up all the surrounding houses causing real estate to sky rocket thereby pushing out the millennials from ever owning a house in a decent area. And when the market crashes the oldies won&#39;t lose anything other than excessive profit from their investments whilst the millennials will have to declare bankruptcy because their only property has big fuck off mortgage on it. </p>

<p>Regulations put into place by governments help curtail this. They put stamp duty on purchases to discourage speculative investing (it didn&#39;t). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ANYONE INTO SPORTS??? MONEY TO MADE COMPLETELY FREE IN THIS APP</p>

<p>You do not have to pay anything to play and once you reach 10USD you can cash out through PayPal.</p>

<p>Quick Summary
You play in rounds where you predict different plays/scores/outcomes during live sports games. You are given two options - a yes or no and each has accompanying odds. You play in rooms with up to 20 people with the top ~8 players getting paid in cash or tokens. Each game seems to have levels – you can enter a free room with lower payouts and paid rooms with higher payouts. You can win tickets from competing in free rooms to enter the paid rooms and try to win a bit of money. Questions usually popup with a change of position in football or every ~5ish minutes for basketball, with an accompanying notification. This means you do not have to be on your phone constantly, so you can multitask quite easily.</p>

<p>Tips (aka reasons to use my ref link)
Use the tickets you win from free rooms to enter higher payout rooms that require a ticket pay-in
Watch the game! For example, a prediction for “Will the play be overturned?” is much easier if you are watching the game.
In free play rooms, enter the room a few minutes after the start of the quarter. The number of people in the room will be less and it will take longer to fill up, letting you get in a few predictions while you compete with less players making it easier to win!
Play in the mid-tier room to win a decent number of tickets before going into the high-tier room. Payouts in the high-tier room are great but even if you do well you do not win very many tickets.
Look at the ongoing tournaments and enter them! They have high payouts relative to the normal game.</p>

<p>Why Does WinView Pay? You get a few bonus points for watching ads and PepsiCo seems to be funding most of the business right now with the intent on moving the service to a live betting system where everyone has to pay.</p>

<p>(HOWEVER, it is still free to enter and will be free for the foreseeable future)
Once you have 50 tickets you can play in the money rooms. The setup is exactly same. The only difference is you can win money and tickets. First place in a football room wins $8 unless there is a tie. In which case, it is a dollar less as the 1st and 2nd place pot is split.

    <div class="md"><p>It even comes down to everyday things like not being able to buy toilet paper and other consumer goods in bulk to save on per unit costs and buying cheap work boots instead of better quality ones that will last longer and in the end cost less.</p>

<p>These things along with late fees, account deficit fees, other associated financial punishments for not having money on time, poor eating due to financial constrictions, I&#39;ll health due to poor eating, over work, stress and other factors. It seems as though the poor are locked on an inescapable cycle of poverty and deprivation that begins at birth and ends at death.</p>

<p>Imagine a baby born into the cycle with a lowered chance of a good education, little access to good nutrition, growing up in a neighbourhood with less community amenities, less support networks to achieve, and couple that with being surrounded by others of various generations who are also caught in the cycle. It&#39;s no wonder they seem to go through life with a metaphorical ball and chain attached to their ankles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your beliefs form your personal reality. If one wants to own a home, then maybe Northern Ca. is not the place to be. Plenty of places with affordable homes. Probabilities come into play. At 5&#39;8&quot; and 58 years old, I can dream of being the center for the LA Lakers, but it won&#39;t happen no matter how hard I practice. Owning a home is likely for almost anyone, if they hold the vision and act towards it. It takes continuous action, and also being open to opportunities that present themselves. I don&#39;t believe in scarcity, and also don&#39;t present that picture or belief system to other people&#39;s minds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely agree. A study was done that found most rich people (net assets over $1,000,000) are just average joes living In middle class neighborhoods who live frugally and own small businesses that they founded. Most people who inherit money end up losing it within 3 generations. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about making sacrifices and working hard. Save your money and put all your effort into bettering yourself. Whether you start a business or work in retail, nothing is stopping you from being driven and willing to take initiative. </p>
