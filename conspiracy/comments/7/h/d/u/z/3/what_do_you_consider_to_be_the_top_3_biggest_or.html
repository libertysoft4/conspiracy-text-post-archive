    <div class="md"><p>Well, the Great Recession of 2008 was caused by 40 years of failed Monetary and Trade policy, and none of the issues that created that mess have been fixed. QE 1-3 failed, because all they did was slow the oncoming Depression. The economy still hasn&#39;t returned to normal, and it should scare everyone that Yelen is resigning only 5 years into her 10 year term...because she sees what is on the horizon and wants to be gone long enough that she doesn&#39;t get dragged into the shitstorm of blame when it all comes crashing down.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter, tho, because when the next Recession comes, and it&#39;s worse than &#39;08, Yelen and Bernanke will be rightly blamed for this mess, along with the rest of the Fed and its directors since at least &#39;77. The &quot;recovery&quot; was no recover at all. We&#39;ve literally replaced Middle and High Class jobs with low-wage Service Sector Jobs. Here are some sobering numbers- 41% of the jobs lost in &#39;08 were High Wage jobs, while only 30% of those created since then are High Wage. 37% of jobs lost were Middle Wage jobs, yet only 26% of those created since then are Middle Wage. And 22% of jobs lost in &#39;08 were low wage jobs, yet a staggering 44% of all jobs created since &#39;08 are low wage Service Sector.</p>

<p>We have fundamentally altered the base of our economy with this &quot;recovery&quot;, and in doing so have permanently locked millions out of the Middle Class because those jobs just <em>don&#39;t exist anymore</em>. What&#39;s worse, is that what is left of the &quot;Middle Class&quot; is a shell of itself, built on debt- Mortgage Debt, Credit Card Debt, Auto Debt, Student Loan Debt. Trillions and Trillions. Q3 of 2017 saw US Household debt rise by more than .9%...so just let thank sink in for a moment.</p>

<p>When the reckoning comes, and it will be sooner rather than alter, it is going to shake this country and the Republic to its core, and I am not sure if we will be able to come together and survive it. </p>

<p>I mean the economic reckoning. The failed monetary and trade policies that will come home to roost and destroy this country.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m more of a Social Democrat, if anything. And I have never really favored the whole &quot;Terror&quot; aspect of the French Revolution...violence begets violence. We must find a political solution or else there will be nothing but death.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>just the continued trend of of shity growth in america as it declines</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My fear, as stated in my post. I believe there is an opportunity to right the ship, however, through mass Public action and organization at the grassroots level. This country has done it before, in the 1890&#39;s and the 1930&#39;s. Time will tell if we can do it again.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not only do I not posses the means, but I lack the will. For better or worse I love this country, and I will stick it through to the bitter end. My family has been here since the 16th century, this is <em>my</em> country, and I will not abandon it. And though things are better for now, the collapse of the US will drag the rest of the Western world with it, so unless you throw all your eggs in the Eastern basket, I believe the reckoning will catch up to all of Western Civ. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. And although there are movements of varying sizes doing just this thing in many states, we need a lot more. I think we should also start seriously considering the idea of Urban farming, and start striving to make every city self sufficient as much as it can be based on local goods and produce.</p>

<p>One of the testing grounds for such a new Social order would be Detroit- it is so run down and abandoned, that Urban farming is making a huge comeback, and Detroit could offer a blueprint for the model 21st century American City, if we play our cards right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually, no, not really to either of those times did mass action correct anything</p>

<p>1890 was just reaction to the civil war and, if anything, new and more terrible social polices kept blacks out of the work place to keep whites working till the 70&#39;s- and then that integration ended union solidarity almost immediately- which is why there is no mass action today, because white people will not unionize for perceived benefits for blacks</p>

<p>the 1930&#39;s literally nothing was accomplished through mass action- it was FDR seizing power and not leaving office until his fucking death- he stacked courts, gutted the constitution and generally ignored the rule of law, which was the style at the time considering hitler, stalin, mussolini ect where in power so why not</p>

<p>but no, nothings coming, the fact is, the vast majority of people are benefiting from the current global economic shift- america is just so fucked in its policies and has no plan that it has been a complete lost decade</p>

<p>i personally blame racism- i think, that just by having a white man as president by the end of trumps term, if they don&#39;t kick him out, you will see GDP 6-7 % again and dow 30,000- not because he did anything, just because while obama was president no one would invest in our country either because his leadership was terrible or because it was seemed terrible because of race</p>

<p>so in like 3 years we should be back to at least something normal in america, though a lot of industries are just dead now- like law (5 million less law jobs) healthcare is completely fucked, other fields as well</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I am referencing the campaigns of William Jennings Bryan and the Union movements of the 1870&#39;s and 80&#39;s themselves, and the fact that it culminated in actual reform like the 17th Amendment and Trust Busting.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>FDR was elected by the People, and he worked with Unions and political organizers not only to get elected but to enact his reforms. I agree that the court stacking was bullshit but the reforms of FDR helped to ensure that the economic gains of the Post-War order were equitably distributed via strong labor and corporate regulation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but no, nothings coming, the fact is, the vast majority of people are benefiting from the current global economic shift- america is just so fucked in its policies and has no plan that it has been a complete lost decade</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The West is not benefiting. The West is losing out to globalization, because of this fucked up mentality of &quot;well even though Union workers are now out of a job and barely making it in the US, some Chinese workers is making 1$ an hour and so is better off than they were&quot;. I do not believe in global &quot;progress&quot; at the expense of this country and the West in general.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The problems are waaaaay deeper than that. We have structural economic issues which have been in the making for 40+ years, and failed monetary and trade policies that have undermined our own Middle Class. There is no simple fix, just because a &quot;white guy&quot; is in office. The US and the West are in dire trouble and so many fail to realize this. What is coming isn&#39;t a DOW at 30k and 7% growth, it is a Depression and economic collapse brought about by the failed policies implemented to combat the &#39;08 Recession.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so in like 3 years we should be back to at least something normal in america,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah, within 3 years we will likely be in the thick of &#39;08 part II.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you don&#39;t have the will to leave then your failures are you own</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never said they weren&#39;t. I said that for better or worse I will stay here to the bitter end because this is <em>my</em> country, and my family has been here for generations. I will not abandon it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think of obama very similar to mayor dinkins of nyc</p>

<p>he really broke the city economy and it took a long time to recover, traditional investors where just not willing to work in the city under his leadership- you can blame it on his own bad leadership or general racism- i blame both in the case of obama</p>

<p>regardless, the economy has changed, america is not what it was, learn a new language and move </p>

<p>I disagree.  All the checks and balances have been bought and corrupted.  At this point negotiations with psychopaths are pointless.  Their word means nothing.  They don&#39;t care about your misery.  They don&#39;t care about fairness, or justice, or truth.  They don&#39;t consider you as worthy of placating.  They see people below them as farm animals.</p>

<p>Without violence or the threat of violence the system CANNOT change.  It&#39;s been rewired to withstand political pressure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very good question.</p>

<p>Nothing in the past ten years comes close to 9/11, the &#39;moon landings&#39; or JFK.</p>

<p>It is difficult to go past Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>The supposed rover landing on Mars is critically important to the scientism narrative and deserves to be up there on the shortlist.</p>

<p>Perhaps its recent occurrence biases my judgement but the Route 91 shooting hoax might make the shortlist.</p>

<p>The Anders Brievik hoax would be a likely candidate for the shortlist as well.</p>

<p>Too many hoaxes to choose from, really.</p>
