    <div class="md"><p>The Earth may be flat, but it also may be spherical and hollow all at the same time.  If the universe is a holograph like string theorists and physicists are beginning to calculate then it means that Earth is flat in the sense that it is technically a 2D data stream or unified field that is just projected/interpreted to be 3D.  The Earth is hollow because it is a projection of this 2D data, making it a hologram.  The Earth is round, well, because the projection of our planet Earth is perceived as round to us.  </p>

<p>Those thoughts, in combination with &quot;laughable&quot; conspiracies like &quot;underground aliens&quot; involved in &quot;hollow earth&quot; conspiracies start to make more sense when you evaluate them less literally, like how one might examine The Bible from a allegorical sense (I&#39;m a mystic/atheist/agnostic so don&#39;t interpret that incorrectly).  Then you start thinking about hidden data centers underground used to spy on us and it&#39;s not such a wonder why there were so many &quot;underground&quot; conspiracies to begin with.  If you really want to dig deeper...maybe you wonder why some could believe in reptilian &quot;shape shifting&quot;.  </p>

<p>Well when you start getting into string theory and how our brains collapse quantum field wave functions that create our particulate world (collapsing wave functions into particles like the double slit quantum theory experiments), you realize that vibrations and frequencies seem to define our material world.  Almost like the quantum field runs through us, electrifying us into life.  There is even data out there suggesting that our brains actually know up to 6 sec. in advance of something about to happen (aka a scientist can pinpoint your decision 6 seconds before you are even consciously aware of it yourself). Our mass is actually a form of energy and there is more space than matter in our universe.   The longer you look at something, the more artificial it becomes (it is less of an object and more of an image in your mind now).  Many quantum physicists believe that the only way all data sucked into a black hole can fit on the surface area of the black hole is because data is lost over time (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsbZT9bJ1s4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsbZT9bJ1s4</a>).  So it kinds of makes sense that the more you look at the projection...the more you see through it.  It makes sense why the real magicians of the occult have been said to practice their imagination and mind vision (even Nikoli Tesla).  It&#39;s then not so far out for a conspiracy theorist to imagine that maybe humans can variate the frequency of the interpretation of our existence (our mass, our energy) and transform, or shape shift by hacking into the 2D datastream.  It&#39;s also possible we all do that because everyone perceives things differently.  It&#39;s like we are actually the AI, created by computers, because everything else is so perfect.  </p>

<p>Sorry for any spelling errors or grammatical errors I don&#39;t have more time to focus tonight.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find flat earth an interesting theory and some of the points brought across by people who believe in flat earth are thought provoking and seem to have some basis. I’m not a scientist by any stretch of the word, but as your average fellow, I think it’s not unbelievable.
The government does lie, the fact that they could also be lying about the shape of the earth doesn’t seem far stretched to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of the possibility of being lied to at that level is believable.  Like aliens living amongst us today or that we came from Mars.  However there are so many ways to prove their theory (earth being flat) yet they don&#39;t crowdsource the effort.  Instead they focus on edited videos and explain how planes fly upside down that cross the equator.</p>

<p>Also a crowd sourced effort would be hard due to the fact the majority of people think the flat earth theory is batshit crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the assessment here. I think a lot of these &quot;people&quot; are working together as well. On one account they&#39;ll be poisoning the well with flat earth bullshit, on another they&#39;re trying as hard as they can to convince people here to not investigate the topics brought up by an anonymous 4chan user, then they hop over to their anti-Trump account where they ignore relevant, substantive criticisms to arbitrarily accuse him of being a Russian spy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually get a text from HQ that you are talking about Pizzagate. A lot of people think we are in an office or whatever by I shill from home. Wait can a paid government shill be anti trump? They would be pro trump. Also no one is a &quot;Clinton follower&quot; anymore. She lost and even liberals hate her. Just because I hate Trump doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t think Hillary is a stupid cunt. They all suck kid </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did anyone suggest that a PR person (aka shill) for social media is paid by the government?  Nope.  We are not suggesting people follow Clinton it is the double standard people are pointing out.  Most people are not even proTrump.  Most are anti-establishment/deep state.  It seems any anti-establishment/deep state favoring attracts a crowd of anti-trump people. </p>
