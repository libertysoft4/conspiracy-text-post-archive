<p>That&#39;s it. Republicans control the presidency, the house, the senate, so who is the necessary enemy? They need one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone recently did some numbers on Sean Hannity &#39;covering&#39; Hillary, and - don&#39;t quote me on the exact numbers here - it was something like, over the 100 days of this past summer, he led with a Hillary story 83 of those days. (Again, don&#39;t quote my numbers; they&#39;re certainly not exact, I&#39;m going from memory.)</p>

<p>The fixation is because you need an enemy in order to keep people rallying and focused on something other than negative news about your own side. Give people someone to hate and they&#39;re easier to lead around by the nose.</p>

<p>And let&#39;s face it, Hillary is <em>really</em> easy to hate. She&#39;s an easy target, so the Hannitys and Trumps of the world go on autopilot and invoke her name whenever they can to fire up their base, despite the fact that she&#39;s been rendered largely irrelevant by her loss.</p>

<p>And <em>that&#39;s</em> the key: she&#39;s irrelevant. Unlike, say, <em>the sitting president</em>, she wields no real power and is in no position to make decisions that impact not just the country, but the entire globe. The only reason to focus on her is because there is a need for someone to hate.</p>

<p>When she was still in power that was another story. Slam her all day long. But to still be fixated even now?</p>

<p>It&#39;s over, Sean &amp; co. You won. Why are you still acting like you&#39;re losing?</p>

<p>She&#39;s not &quot;significant&quot; anymore so we shouldn&#39;t worry about her past deeds.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a distraction to constantly focus on her even though she&#39;s done extremely questionable things.</p>

<p>The people that have a problem with Hilary are alt-right, conservative, and Td cultists.</p>

<p>This discourse is absolutely fucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I hate both. I get called a Hillary and DNC shill all the time, but I really don&#39;t like/care about her. I just hate Trump as well and recognize she can&#39;t do anything but go on talk shows and make comments to news papers and Trump can literally order the extermination of human life via nukes. Every one who said something bad about Trump doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re a Hillary supporter. It just means we don&#39;t obsess over a 70 year old lady who has literally zero influence or impacts on our personal lives. </p>
