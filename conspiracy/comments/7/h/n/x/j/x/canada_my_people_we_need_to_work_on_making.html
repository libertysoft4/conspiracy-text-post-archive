    <div class="md"><p>Have fun with your internet lagging 4-5 generations behind the rest of the world; example: </p>

<p>1940 electricity- droopy wires strung between poles, </p>

<p>2017 electricity- droopy wires hung between poles</p>

<p>Public utilities are slow to spend money on upgrading their infrastructure; with how rapidly technologies progress, if internet had been a public utility from the beginning most of us would probably just be getting DSL.</p>

<p>Also, the premise of your post is flawed; I&#39;m going to copy a post I made the other day explaining this upcoming change, but just ask yourself this: if ending &quot;net neutrality&quot; is good for big businesses, why are they all against it?</p>

<p><strong>Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers must treat all data on the Internet the same, and not discriminate or charge differently by user, content, website, platform, application, type of attached equipment.</strong></p>

<p>In 2015 the FCC reclassified ISP&#39;s from &quot;Title I Information Services&quot; to &quot;Title II Telecommunication Providers&quot;. Title II gave the FCC the authority to regulate ISP&#39;s in the same way they regulate telephone service providers (Title II was originally developed to regulate AT&amp;T&#39;s monopoly). Title I gave the FTC oversight, which it had from the beginning of the internet until 2015.</p>

<p>The reason for this change was some instances of ISP&#39;s throttling their service to disrupt their customers VoIP service so they&#39;d have to use the ISP&#39;s phone service, and Comcast throttling people torrenting.</p>

<p>Nowadays they can&#39;t really get away with it without anyone knowing, however we are seeing more and more censorship from companies like Google and Facebook, and the FCC under Title II doesn&#39;t really have a way to regulate them. The FCC was created to regulate radio and telephones and they aren&#39;t well suited for what they&#39;re being asked to do now.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some links to the &quot;What We Do&quot; pages for both the FCC and the FTC and a short summary of what you&#39;ll find.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/about-fcc/what-we-do">FCC</a>- The Federal Communications Commission regulates interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable in all 50 states</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/what-we-do">FTC</a>- The FTC is a bipartisan federal agency with a unique dual mission to protect consumers and promote competition. As we begin our second century, the FTC is dedicated to advancing consumer interests while encouraging innovation and competition in our dynamic economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your healthcare might be free but ours is better quality. That&#39;s due to free market economics which pushes competition and innovation. Having the government run your water and electric utilities is fine, there aren&#39;t going to be any major innovations in those areas anytime soon so all they have to do is keep everything working. Making ISP&#39;s is a whole other thing, if you make them public utilities they won&#39;t have any competition; no competition, no reason to innovate and improve.</p>

<p>And before you argue about the US having better quality treatment:</p>

<p>Colorectal Cancer: US 5th, Canada 10th</p>

<p>Breast Cancer: US 1st, Canada T2nd</p>

<p>Cervical Cancer: Canada 11th, US 19th</p>

<p>Heart Attack: US 7th, Canada 8th</p>

<p>Hemorrhagic Stroke: Canada 15th, US 16th</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is ridiculous as the only cases sourced are the ones that have been diagnosed and treated. Life expectancy in the US sits comfortably between <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy">Costa Rica and Cuba</a> which is actually better than I&#39;d expected what with the US nestled right in at 31st place. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita">This</a> shows that US expenditure per capita is roughly double that of any other country developed enough to know better. And crim three different respected  sources I might add. </p>

<p>Tell me again how awesome the US healthcare system is please because the whole world disagrees with your sentiment. And the world is right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bandwidth you pay your ISP for costs them next to nothing.  Tiny fractions of a cent per gigabyte.  Even with last mile infrastructure costs included, most broadband plans are over 90% profit margin.</p>

<p>That is a pretty sweet business model, especially since the companies delivering the service have managed to get either monopoly or near monopoly status in most markets.</p>

<p>If there are &quot;sagging poles&quot; from your internet providers network, it has nothing to do with the FCC, title II or anything other than craven ISP profit taking.</p>

<p>Blaming Google or Facebook for this problem is bizarre.  We can choose where we want our entertainment to come from but most of us can&#39;t choose the wire that gets it to us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about? The sagging wires thing was an analogy, all of Comcast or whoevers cables are in the ground, just like the electric and phone lines should be, and they are some places, but since they&#39;ve been a public utility from the start they haven&#39;t upgraded their infrastructure that&#39;s been like that for 100 years. If internet started out as a public utility a lot of people would still have 56k dialup, and the lucky ones <em>might</em> be getting DSL put in.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t blaming the FCC or Title II for &quot;sagging poles from my internet provider&quot; (wtf?), I&#39;m saying that the issue they were brought in to handle (ISP&#39;s throttling sites they don&#39;t like) has now expanded; you haven&#39;t heard how Google, Facebook, and Twitter have been censoring things they don&#39;t approve of?</p>

<p>Being on Reddit it&#39;s likely you&#39;re a liberal and so you&#39;ll say &quot;they&#39;re just censoring conservative websites, that&#39;s a good thing because they&#39;re <strong>nazis</strong>&quot;. First of all, if you actually think that you should do some research into the tenets of fascism, it&#39;s pretty similar to leftism and actually pretty much the opposite of conservatism, but even if conservatives were actual card carrying neonazis, does censoring anything for any reason sound like net neutrality? Remember, it has a definition:</p>

<p>Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers must treat all data on the Internet the same, and <strong>not discriminate or charge differently by user, content</strong>, website, platform, application, type of attached equipment.</p>

<p>So are you for or against net neutrality? Because the FCC doesn&#39;t have any authority over the internet, just ISP&#39;s, whereas the FTC can control ISP&#39;s <em>and</em> the actual internet companies that are currently shitting on the idea of neutrality, and they&#39;ll do it with antitrust and consumer protection laws rather than rules and regulations like the FCC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you not read my post? Here&#39;s how the FCC does consumer protection:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau develops and implements the FCC&#39;s consumer policies and serves as the agency&#39;s connection to the American consumer. Our mission includes disability rights, consumer education, and outreach to state, local and Tribal governments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the FTC:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FTC protects consumers by stopping unfair, deceptive or fraudulent practices in the marketplace. We conduct investigations, sue companies and people that violate the law, develop rules to ensure a vibrant marketplace, and educate consumers and businesses about their rights and responsibilities. We collect complaints about hundreds of issues from data security and deceptive advertising to identity theft and Do Not Call violations, and make them available to law enforcement agencies worldwide for follow-up. Our experienced and motivated staff uses 21st century tools to anticipate – and respond to – changes in the marketplace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those were taken off each of their websites; which one sounds like a better resource for consumer protection? Plus, seeing as how the FTC was in charge of regulating the internet from it&#39;s conception up to 2015 they have a lot more experience.</p>

<p>All you people that are freaking out about &quot;ending net neutrality&quot; are falling for propaganda and astroturfing from the big companies that don&#39;t want to have restrictions on the shady shit they do like selling their customers info to advertisers, or trying to influence politics since they have the ability to control what people see. You know Mark Zuckerberg is thinking about running for president? I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a democrat, that should scare the shit out of you; he&#39;s got access to <em>everyone&#39;s</em> personal info, and currently there&#39;s no regulatory agency (FCC) that has the ability to do anything about it, up til a couple years ago they mostly just fined tv and radio if they swore..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DARPA invented the internet. You never had any rights. You were being monitored. When they change their mind they will do whatever they want with their creation. The internet isn&#39;t a savior, but rather a prison. When all this shit goes down just say fuck it, and don&#39;t use it anymore. Then you will see them beg you for your money, and allow what you want. Just like flying on a plane. Bankrupt the airline companies, and you won&#39;t be getting a finger put in your ass at the airport. They would beg you to come fly again. We become domesticated , and entitled. Show them all we can go with out and you will see how much they will give.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking about the US here where corporate influence has completely wormed it&#39;s way into political structure. This is what I want to avoid here in Canada. Our healthcare system works better and more efficiently than the US system does and there isn&#39;t any reason why the same cannot and will not be true with a universal internetwork. </p>

<p>You&#39;re thinking like a business. Shake off those thoughts for the greater good of the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incidentally, the capitalist internet overlords that span the US are not even in competition with eachother and have defined boundaries as to their respective areas of operation (With some exception). The US falls already well behind in internet speed and is horrendously expensive comparatively. Also the American taxpayer has already paid ISPs an enormous amount of money for upgrades that never happened and if I wasn&#39;t on mobile right now I&#39;d be more than happy to share with you and everybody else some of the thousands of sources that validate my truthful claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bandwidth you pay your ISP for costs them next to nothing.  Tiny fractions of a cent per gigabyte.  Even with last mile infrastructure costs included, most broadband plans are over 90% profit margin.</p>

<p>That is a pretty sweet business model, especially since the companies delivering the service have managed to get either monopoly or near monopoly status in most markets.</p>

<p>If there are &quot;sagging poles&quot; from your internet providers network, it has nothing to do with the FCC, title II or anything other than craven ISP profit taking.</p>

<p>Blaming Google or Facebook for this problem is bizarre.  We can choose where we want our entertainment to come from but most of us can&#39;t choose the wire that gets it to us.</p>
