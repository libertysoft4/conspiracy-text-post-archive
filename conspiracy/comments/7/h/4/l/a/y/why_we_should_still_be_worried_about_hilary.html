<p>Why not the same level of scrutiny? Many people agree that there is far more evidence in regards to Uranium 1, including an FBI informant that had a gag order put on them by Obama.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not worried though. I believe that&#39;s where MUH RUSSIA is headed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are at home touching yourself over Flynn getting arrested while simultaneously saying Clinton shouldn&#39;t be held to same scrutiny. The irony.</p>

<p>Many people agree because of the information that&#39;s been presented in regards to her role on CFIUS and the connections she has to the Podesta Group. The FBI informant has stated that there is evidence kickbacks were paid to the Clintons via their foundation. Why shouldn&#39;t she be subjected to the same scrutiny? Why do you think that just because she isn&#39;t President, these things shouldn&#39;t be looked into further? If someone rapes and murders your mother, and a suspect is identified who isn&#39;t Donald Trump, should they not be investigated either?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironic because you say Clinton is not President so shouldn&#39;t be subjected to scrutiny. While at same time you are fapping over Flynn getting brought in. Even though he&#39;s not the President. That&#39;s irony. </p>

<p>Crimes deserve justice. Period. I don&#39;t know what scrutiny means? You seem to think scrutiny is defined as media coverage. Are you fucking serious? </p>

<p>Trump might have more power than Hillary at this very second. He didn&#39;t 12 months ago. So according to you, she should be able to go on her merry way now. Incredible. People like you are the reason politicians take advantage of us in the United States. If holding office means I&#39;m able to commit crimes and can&#39;t be held accountable for them if they aren&#39;t discovered until I leave office, who wouldn&#39;t go into politics and become a scumbag criminal? You&#39;re a fucking moron. And your mentality is extremely dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you just wrote her off as sitting at home knitting.</p>

<p>You are wrong here; all serious crime deserves scrutiny. The crimes committed by people so high up in the power structure merit more of it at times because of the scope and scale of their crimes and how many people they can impact and how dangerous it can be for an entire country or the entire planet.</p>

<p>The difference between Trump and Clinton is fractional, and only in recent times. Historically, the Clintons had far more power than Trump.</p>

<p>Now that you have shown yourself to favor preferential treatment to Hillary over Trump, you want to turn this discussion into me overreacting and needing to calm down. You&#39;re a disgrace.</p>

<p>According to you, Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State from the previous administration, the third highest seat in the nation, does not deserve the same scrutiny as Trump...<em>at this time</em>...</p>

<p>So when then? In a few months when the Trump/Russia investigation is wrapped up? What is an appropriate timeline, in your opinion? On a scale of 1-100, Trump being 100, would you say Hillary deserves a scrutiny level of a 98? Just trying to get an idea of how far off we are here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and let&#39;s hope they get her for whatever crimes she&#39;s committed, but what relevance does any of this have to the current controversies in Trump&#39;s administration?</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m wondering why every post critical of Trump seems to need a comment about Hillary. What&#39;s the point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironic because you say Clinton is not President so shouldn&#39;t be subjected to scrutiny. While at same time you are fapping over Flynn getting brought in. Even though he&#39;s not the President. That&#39;s irony. </p>

<p>Crimes deserve justice. Period. I don&#39;t know what scrutiny means? You seem to think scrutiny is defined as media coverage. Are you fucking serious? </p>

<p>Trump might have more power than Hillary at this very second. He didn&#39;t 12 months ago. So according to you, she should be able to go on her merry way now. Incredible. People like you are the reason politicians take advantage of us in the United States. If holding office means I&#39;m able to commit crimes and can&#39;t be held accountable for them if they aren&#39;t discovered until I leave office, who wouldn&#39;t go into politics and become a scumbag criminal? You&#39;re a fucking moron. And your mentality is extremely dangerous.</p>
