Everybody is happy and smiling and I&#39;m just like what are you people on? Are these people fluoridated that bad or do they lie to themselves and play like everything is cool when it&#39;s not?</p>

<p>For example, people on LinkedIn. All of these positive posts about motivation, why it&#39;s good to work hard and then talk about their happy lives without realizing that they are wage slaves. The people I speak of see us as a big part of the problem but the real problem is them, the majority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont mean to sound rude at all with this comment. If you really feel this way, I suggest stepping away from internet forums, news sources, and conspiracy theories. Try focusing your attention on things around you. There REALLY IS so much around you to explore, enjoy, and love, you just need to find out what/who that is. I read this subreddit everyday, but just recently realized that if I didn&#39;t read it and completely ignored news/twitter, I WOULDN&#39;T BE MISSING OUT ON ANYTHING. Cause when you really think about it, trawling r/conspiracy or 4chan or even MSM is purely lust. As in, you take in all this information, in order to elicit a feeling (be it feeling informed, objectified, or angry) but then you don&#39;t do anything about it and nothing in your life changes. 
r/conspiracy is fun, but it isn&#39;t productive, and more importantly, it shouldn&#39;t be the biggest portion of your life. Maybe try reaching out to an old friend, playing basketball, or creating something.</p>

<p>I know this post may make me look like a shill, but I just want you to be happy dude, it is very possible no matter what Soros, Killary, or Trump is up to</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting this, I agree with your point. I started reading conspiracy because it was always interesting to hear other people&#39;s views on certain things, but now it elecits a feeling from me when I comment or read stuff I don&#39;t agree with. It&#39;s not necessarily bad, but it can take my attention away from other things, and I end up on conspiracy for hours. Your post made me realize that so thank you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually a good post.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know. I honestly think people will do anything before facing the truth. Eat more, sleep more, consume more, gossip more...</p>

<p>But nobody wants to face the truth. I mean maybe this is cliche but I always wondered how people could be so happy in their bubbles while others in the world were clearly suffering?</p>

<p>I mean we have to live our lives and clearly we would go crazy if that is all we thought about.</p>

<p>But just a little more thought for iyhers would help this planet immensely.</p>

<p>Also I really dislike Christmas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t speak for others, but sometimes you gotta tune out and allow yourself to feel happy for your mental health. Maybe that&#39;s what some of the Target shoppers were trying to do. I like to get out and see Christmas decorations and pick out gifts for my loved ones.  </p>

<p>Motivational quotes are obnoxious but some folks gotta justify their unhappiness and convince themselves that being overworked is an admirable trait and that happiness is contingent on working a job you hate and that the ends justify the means. It&#39;s against human nature to enjoy pushing a pencil or working some 9-5, but it&#39;s human nature to convince yourself that something you hate doing is actually something you don&#39;t mind, or even like doing, if it means you&#39;ll be able to have money and food and shelter. We&#39;re all just trying to make it one more rotation around the sun at a time man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LinkedIn isn&#39;t a great example. It&#39;s specifically for employment networking. You look like a better employee if you edit yourself down to &quot;Hard work is awesome!&quot; &quot;Strive and Thrive!&quot; &quot;(Insert Motivational Image)&quot;.</p>

<p>As far as the rest of it though, I think it&#39;s a combination. You largely have the genuinely ignorant, the willfully ignorant (those who hear about the ill of the world but don&#39;t want to believe it), and the avoidant (those who know the ill of the world but don&#39;t want to confront it).</p>

<p>I fall into the avoidant category. Perpetually indulging the negativity, even if negativity is truth, isn&#39;t sustainable for me long-term. There are times I have to break away from it and just breathe and enjoy what I have, even if I know it&#39;s all fucked in the end. My life is only so long, and I&#39;m only willing to spend so much of it feeling anxious and overwhelmed and miserable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You decide how the world around you affects your state of mind. Sure, things are shit, we&#39;re all being lied to and the elite run the whole world.

<p>They already control the external world, don&#39;t let them control your emotions too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion your point of view seems very judgemental and toxically negative. One can realize that they are being screwed over by the system, but still find a way to be happy in day to day life. Happiness, positivity, and love is what gets a lot of people <em>through</em> harsh times and it&#39;s one thing &quot;they&quot; can&#39;t take away from you unless you let them. </p>

<p>If I was living in a van down by the river but I had my family (pets) and just enough for the bare essentials to live, I would still be a happy person and try to spread that happiness to anyone that would let it in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s the <strong>tree of knowledge between right and wrong</strong></p>

<p>not a symbol of seeing or knowing anything</p>

<p>but rather the ability to judge and feel judgmental</p>

<p>Jesus made sense in extension of above reading <strong>because</strong> he commanded to &quot;love your enemies...&quot; rather than judge them</p>

<p>I like your use of old stories to make sense of current day, but I humbly will state that Adam &amp; Eve in this context was <strong>misapplied</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it really is like in the matrix. Life looks so normal on the outside.  And many ppl willingly take blue pills and refuse to acknowledge reality.  </p>

<p>But it may be by design. It takes too much energy just  to survive against the demands and attacks we are subjected to on a daily, unending, worsening basis.  Ppl just want to cross their finish line for the day and have a few moments of peace.  They can’t afford to care, to think about something beyond their influence.  We are scattered, like sheep without a shepherd. </p>

<p>I️ blame them too. I️ think, ‘Why, how can’t you, don’t you care that everything is so evil ?!’  ‘Doesn’t it <em>bother you</em>? ‘ ‘Don’t you feel any responsibility to <em>do</em> something?’ ‘Aren’t we our brother’s keeper?  Yes, the answer is yes, we are!’  Is it learned helplessness?  Have we been subjected to subliminal elsagate videos?<br/>
Those who fight back are ruined and destroyed.  <em>We</em> have seen these horrors unfold with impunity for many months, years now?  Such insidious and world class evil requires something beyond our capability. It requires our savior. </p>

<p>Even in our darkening broken world, God’s gifts are evident and sustaining. Hope and joy spring in our hearts as we await His final triumph over evil. His handiwork reminds us of His goodness, His word reassures us that He has got this.  No matter how ugly, beyond belief, that it is, He will make everything right. </p>

<p>Our best weapon is Prayer.  We can rejoice bec we have a good God on our side who will triumph over all this mess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting this, I agree with your point. I started reading conspiracy because it was always interesting to hear other people&#39;s views on certain things, but now it elecits a feeling from me when I comment or read stuff I don&#39;t agree with. It&#39;s not necessarily bad, but it can take my attention away from other things, and I end up on conspiracy for hours. Your post made me realize that so thank you</p>
