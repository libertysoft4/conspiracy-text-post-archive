<p>So what if the cabin is oxygenated, and pressurized. They are still floating in a vacuum.  Now, do you think a vacuum could suck something inside a vacuum?</p>

<p>Stay with me, they have to suspend themselves in a weightless position and then somehow their waste gets sucked into this vacuum instead floating all over the place.  Think about this man, you can have you waste sucked into a vacuum while you are in a weightless suspended zero g environment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t know what a vacuum is. You think you do, but you don&#39;t. Vacuums and gravity have nothing in common. Outside of the ISS is space. Space is a vacuum(mostly). Inside ISS there is air at a similar pressure to that of earth, hence not a vacuum. If it was a vacuum people would pass and die within minutes.  This is fact. Just because you don&#39;t understand it doesn&#39;t mean its not true. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>somehow their waste gets sucked into this vacuum instead floating all over the place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the air is being pushed from their ass into the trash by what is basically a vacuum cleaner. Stay with me, they use the bathroom, the waste exits their body and in 0 gravity it just sort of hangs around there until some force acted on it. That&#39;s why they have the vacuum cleaner. The vacuum cleaner then blows or sucks the air and waste into the garbage. Again, vacuums and gravity are two different things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can show you all the experiments done in a vacuum.</p>

<p>Combustion does not work in a vacuum. Air flow doesn&#39;t work in a vacuum.  Actually, the ship itself could not handle the pressure of a vacuum.</p>

<p>Most NASA supporters don&#39;t even look into vacuum chamber experiments.  Know what else is funny? NASA did one test in a vacuum chamber and the guy lasted about ten seconds before his guts started being pulled from his body. They shut it down and never did another, instead switching to Swimming Pools for training.</p>

<p>Watch what a vacuum does.</p>

<p>Most NASA sympathizers don&#39;t even look at the vacuum. It disproves NASA. </p>

<p>Being oxygenated and pressurized makes it not a vacuum...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, do you think a vacuum cleaner toilet could suck something inside the vacuum of space?</p>

<p>No, because their&#39;s no air to create a pressure differential. But, if you put a large aluminum box in the vacuum of space and filled it with air, you could easily create a pressure differential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you understand that opposing forces an cancel out?</p>

<p>For example, if I push you in one direction while someone else pushes you in the opposite direction with the same amount of force, you will not move in either direction.</p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>So a spacecraft is travelling around the earth at a speed that would generate a &quot;centrifugal force&quot; of 1 g, but earth&#39;s gravity is pulling inwards at a force of 1 g too. These two forces cancel out and the spacecraft stays the same distance from the surface.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, the spacecraft must be moving laterally at high speed. This is called &quot;orbit&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not rocket science.</p>

<p>Skydive is straight down, think more like a cannonball that moves fast enough horizontally that it matches the curvature of the earth.</p>

<p>Why? They&#39;re at the same speed and acceleration as the ISS. Think about driving in your car, you only feel the push of momentum when accelerating or decelerating, when your body is traveling at the same speed as the car, you can move about normally.</p>

<p>In a car, the only thing causing the occupant to turn is the action of the turning vehicle... in orbit, gravity is acting upon the occupant equally to the vehicle.</p>

<p>The &quot;centrifugal force&quot; is being balanced by the gravitational force, which is why they appear to float.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>There is because &quot;zero g&quot; is a measure of acceleration in a given reference frame, not of gravity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even the sun would be exerting its gravity on them,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, but it exerts an equal force in proportion to mass on both the occupant and the ISS so it doesn&#39;t affect the motion of those objects in relation to each other, so in the reference frame of the ISS and the occupant, you can ignore it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So right there we have a NASA contradiction. Zero G can&#39;t exist in a solar system dominated by gravity.</p>

<p>Again, &quot;Zero G&quot; is a measurement of acceleration. The occupants and the ISS are traveling at the same speed with the same acceleration towards the Earth, the same acceleration towards the moon, the same acceleration towards the Sun, etc. Therefore, in reference to each other, there is zero G&#39;s of acceleration.</p>
