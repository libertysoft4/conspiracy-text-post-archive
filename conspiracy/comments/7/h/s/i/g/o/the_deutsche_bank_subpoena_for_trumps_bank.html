    <div class="md"><p>The original source that several articles have pointed to is the the German newspaper Handelsblatt. I don&#39;t know anything about how reliable this paper is, but they have not retracted or deleted their story. In the article they site several unnamed &quot;sources familiar with the investigation&quot; along with a spokesperson for Deutsche Bank. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.  I&#39;m seeing a lot of different stories now.  WSJ for example focused its story about previous subpoenas from lawmakers going back to June that were denied.  Either this is strange as fuck or I&#39;m losing my shit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, this is definitely strange as fuck. The Fox article that someone else linked says Trump&#39;s lawyers are claiming the bank told them there were no subpoenas. Someone is obviously wrong here but I have no clue who it is. This seems like a really huge story for one side or the other to be wrong about. If it does turn out to be false, it makes me wonder if someone is intentionally leaking false information to let the media embarrass themselves. If it turns out to be true, either the bank is lying to the lawyer or the lawyer is lying to us. Kinda crazy no matter which way it goes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a bit late, and you may have already figured this out on your own, but I just found this linked in another thread. It is entirely possible that the bank did receive a subpoena but told Trump&#39;s lawyer that they didn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is fucking CIA shit man.  WH Brief said it wasn&#39;t true.  CIA went to Handelsblatt then CNN ran with it.  They had to find another agency because CNN is getting buried with their reputation.  The WSJ article is the one that threw me off because it was pitching the headline but when you read it - it was talking about shit from June.  I think they were trying to ruffle feathers or get Trump team to say something stupid.</p>

<p>1 it is about Trump and his family.  Not Trump the Prez but Trump and family.  By Trump knowing would allow him and his family to prepare for potential loses.
