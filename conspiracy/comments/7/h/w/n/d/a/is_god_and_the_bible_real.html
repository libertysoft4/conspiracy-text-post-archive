    <div class="md"><p>After centuries of iffy translations and misinterpretations, the Bible we have today barely resembles the original story. We have no way of knowing how accurate it is to the way the author(s) intended it. Many of the events described in the bible are physically impossible and clearly exaggerated (walking on water, 2 of every animal on one boat, etc.) I think a lot of it was loosely based on real events and people that actually existed, but there was a lot of fiction added. </p>

<p>As far as God himself goes, it&#39;s not possible with today&#39;s technology to prove or disprove the existence of a higher divine power. The way I see it, there&#39;s no point in arguing for or against something that can&#39;t be confirmed. It&#39;s all just opinion. Im not Christian but that doesn&#39;t mean I think Christians are wrong. I personally don&#39;t believe in the God specifically referred to in the bible because Christianity doesn&#39;t really fit my own personality and morals. But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m an atheist. We obviously came from somewhere </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is the Bible real?  Well there are physical objects with properties, like individual Bibles. Those are real objects.   As objects, they are printed from drafts.  There are different versions traced to different drafts. Some drafts are products of scholars, some are products of theologians, some of both.   The are generating by comparing manuscripts which are all different one from another, and written in languages that are no longer spoken.  As such scholars and theologians use their judgment about which manuscripts and groups of manuscripts to use, sometimes using religious and ideological criteria.  Some versions have religious convictions influence translations. </p>

<p>Going further back in time, and further away in geography, not only are the manuscript traditions different, but the very &#39;books&#39; of the bible varied.  This is called canon.  Are Maccabees included or not, if so, are they referring to the different book by the same name, like for example Ethiopian Maccabees vs Septuagint version. </p>

<p>There is a great table laying out the differences in canon here:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon</a></p>

<p>So that brings us to the question of what was the original canon?  It turns out it is nonsensical question.  There were different religious communities having different canons, and even same religious communities  having different canons and versions circulating internally. </p>

<p>This is a great work on canon generally:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Debate-Lee-Martin-McDonald/dp/0801047080">https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Debate-Lee-Martin-McDonald/dp/0801047080</a></p>

<p>With this one being great for both canon and manuscript traditions of the OT:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Textual-Criticism-Hebrew-Bible-English/dp/0800696646/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1512549697&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=textual+criticism+of+the+hebrew+bible">https://www.amazon.com/Textual-Criticism-Hebrew-Bible-English/dp/0800696646/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1512549697&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=textual+criticism+of+the+hebrew+bible</a></p>

<p>All of this has been ignoring what is actually contained in these collections.  And that is literature of different genres, from different time periods.  It is actually an anthology of literature.  So is the anthology of literature real? Yes, of course.  But all of this has been ignoring the central question.  That is whether this anthology tells us true things about history, and the natural world.  Here it is a mixed bag, with the good majority of the literature being mythical.  Once we come to the &#39;historical books&#39;, there is a lot more good information but it is bent to serve the ideological and religious needs of the writers, who were not objective observers.  So did the Assyrians attack, sure, did angels destroy the Assyrian army... no, the Assyrians won the war.  </p>

<p>So to answer your question, &quot; is the Bible real&quot;?  A short answer is, your question is nonsensical. </p>

<p>No, because they contain matter and energy, which cannot be created or destroyed according to the physical laws of the universe. </p>

<p>By analogy, if you found a human you could not assume they created themself or were eternally existent because creating a human <em>requires</em> a man and a woman.</p>

<p>Similarly, the creation of matter and energy in the universe <em>requires</em> something that is not subject to the laws of physics, or that somehow changes the laws of physics, in order to explain its existence. Aristotle called it the &quot;unmoved mover.&quot;</p>

<p>The humans analogy doesn&#39;t make sense because the humans arrived extremely recently in the scale of cosmology.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know which theoretical physicists you&#39;ve been reading but I haven&#39;t heard that one. I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about what Aristotle said. Those guys were great thinkers but they were among the first in civilization to ask the big questions. We have millennia of knowledge after that to work with.</p>

<p>It sounds like a an internal contradiction because it is violating known natural laws. But that is not an internal inconsistency, it is an external one based on the assumption that the laws of physics are inviolate. Theists believe specifically that there is something that is not subject to the laws of physics that did the creating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really not a paradox, it&#39;s a fact that needs to be dealt with in one&#39;s worldview if you want to avoid non contradiction (believing false things). It&#39;s one thing to say theism is false, but at least it avoids internal contradictions inherent to atheism. Atheism, like all worldviews that don&#39;t involve an &quot;unmoved mover,&quot; simply can&#39;t explain the universe as it exists, so it must be rejected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to take the position of atheism, that&#39;s fine. But saying there is &quot;no evidence for the existence of a God&quot; is just silly. The world as it exists today cannot be explained through existing natural laws because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics">matter and energy are conserved</a>.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t have matter and energy without something outside the system that created the matter and energy <em>ex nihilo.</em> Call it whatever you want God, Allah, Source Aristotle&#39;s Unmoved Mover, and so on, but something created matter and energy by violating the laws of physics, or else something modified the laws of physics. Either way, you can&#39;t explain things without something existing that is not subject to the laws of physics.</p>

<p>Yes. Agnostic theism or even deism is vastly preferable to a worldview containing internal contradictions (atheism). You can start to focus your time on the important question: who is the Unmoved Mover?</p>

<p>The universe is governed by inviolate natural laws.</p>

<p>One of these inviolate natural laws is that matter and energy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics">cannot be created or destroyed</a>.</p>

<p>Matter and energy exist.</p>

<p>But matter and energy cannot exist, because they cannot be created in the first place.</p>

<p>Then you&#39;re not an atheist. You&#39;re agnostic. Atheists claim to <em>know</em> that there was not a creator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but Atheists reject the notion that a god exists. They don&#39;t claim absolut knowledge about a gods existence. At least they shouldn&#39;t if they are intelectually honest. I don&#39;t say that I don&#39;t know if god exists, I reject the claim that one does exist or is needed to explain our own existence.</p>

<p>What I do say is I don&#39;t know how the universe came into existence. And a god isn&#39;t the only possible answer for this. I&#39;ve listed other possible anwers in my previous post. A creator isn&#39;t a necessity.</p>

<p>In addtion we only know the Claim &quot;matter and energy can&#39;t be destroyed or created&quot; is true within our universe. We can&#39;t say that to be true outside our univers because our laws of physics don&#39;t apply there.</p>

<p>Ok thank you for your answer. If I undestand correctly you believe God created the universe and the laws governing it and let it proceed according to those laws but he still guides us and judges us for the entrance into heaven? Do you believe he directly invervenes with our lives? </p>

<p>You can call it whatever you want, but you still need an Unmoved Mover outside of the system. Something that can create energy and matter, or else alter the laws of physics to allow the creation of energy and matter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, I believe he violates the laws of the universe on very rare occasions. Like creating life, creating humanity, coming to Earth as Jesus, and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe he directly invervenes with our lives? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe God intervenes from time to time. Speaking to people, inspiring the writing of books, influencing people to act in certain ways and occasionally directly forcing outcomes.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean he will intervene directly in your life or mine. But that he can be detected and known through his interventions in our world. Even something as simple as observing a sunset or the beauty in nature and realizing there must be a true form that is beautiful behind it.</p>
