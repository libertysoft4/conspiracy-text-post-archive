    <div class="md"><p>Could you give examples of people you believe are &quot;brilliant or leaders&quot; from the past?  </p>

<p>Because I&#39;d argue that there are brilliant people working right now, we just don&#39;t know about them because they haven&#39;t broken through yet.  For example, whoever &quot;cures cancer&quot; will become a legend, but it hasn&#39;t happened yet, but there are tons of people working toward the cause.  </p>

<p>And leaders?  Leaders have detractors, take Obama for example.  You&#39;ll find some who believe he&#39;s a true leader, others will resent the implication, others will think he was an idiot.  Time will tell how history sees him.  But Winston Churchill?  Most people would agree he was a true great leader, but that&#39;s because history neglects his darker policies in favor of being the man to lead Britain through the war. </p>

<p>Basically, everyone is human, even the legends.  They&#39;re all people, good sides and bad.  There are great people out there still, but they&#39;re not perfect, just like those that came before them.</p>

<p>The issue is that people alive now aren&#39;t in the history books yet. You don&#39;t have people talking about their legends and ignoring their flaws. People like Tim Berners-Lee exist and are great people, but you aren&#39;t going to name them because it&#39;s all too recent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep saying there&#39;s no &#39;brilliance&#39; anymore, but it&#39;s unfounded. There are more intelligent people working now than ever before. You keep deriding potential &quot;brilliant&quot; people like Musk or Gates just because your their flaws and I&#39;m telling you, the people you&#39;re calling &quot;brilliant&quot; had their flaws too. </p>

<p>You mention Einstein but don&#39;t mention his critics at the time of his work, he wasn&#39;t just regarded as a hero universally. The same way you critisized Musk and Gates, people critisized Einstein&#39;s work. </p>

<p>You&#39;re comparing present day people to historical figures, and there is a lack of balance there. If you read up on historical figures, you&#39;d see that they&#39;re not always the legends you&#39;ve been taught about. </p>

<p>Like Christopher Columbus, as an example of a leader. If you <strong>just</strong> take your elementary school Columbus Day education of Columbus, he&#39;s a hero. But I&#39;d you actually research what he did, you&#39;d see that his discovering of the America&#39;s was littered with destruction of the indigenous peoples, spreading disease and rape on an unwilling population. He set in motion the horrible treatment of the people in the New World for hundreds of years. </p>

<p>Stop comparing people to legends. Compare people to people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said there flaws aren&#39;t the issue.. I am saying I don&#39;t think they are brilliant. Just businessmen with successful companies.  We aren&#39;t seeing big leaps in technology like in the past. Maybe we are in an era where those can&#39;t happen anymore where as in the past they could.  I don&#39;t see real innovation now days.. just stagnation and incremental growth of established technologies.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Why was Einstein criticized? I don&#39;t know of major criticisms... I don&#39;t see them on the same level at all. I don&#39;t even see Jobs or Gates on the level of Henry Ford...</p>

<p>Again.. not because of who they are as people.. I am saying what they did was not as impressive as Ford at all. For was an incredible innovator... Jobs and Gates are more great businessmen who were in the right place at the right time where developing technology allowed them to capitalize on it and become incredibly successful because of it. Huge successes in business but not brilliant revolutionary thinkers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ford was brilliant? For what? Do you know who Ransom Olds is? He had installed the assembly line in his automobile manufacturing plant in 1901, Ford&#39;s came in 1913. </p>

<p>Ford got credit but came over a decade later. You&#39;re comparing people (Gates, Jobs) to a legend (Ford). When you compare people (Gates, Jobs) to the <em>person</em> (Ford) you also see a shrewd businessman who had his ear to the ground and took advantage of the technology at the time. </p>

<p>You didn&#39;t acknowledge Tim Berners-Lee, who I mentioned earlier. I believe he&#39;s a modern day genius. He invented something you use daily, but most people don&#39;t know who he is. It doesn&#39;t mean brilliance doesn&#39;t exist if you don&#39;t notice who he is right away. </p>

Publicity and grants are bestowed upon those able to be commercialized, those who can produce the most monetary rewards, not those who can furthest advance mankind in the general sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said there flaws aren&#39;t the issue.. I am saying I don&#39;t think they are brilliant. Just businessmen with successful companies.  We aren&#39;t seeing big leaps in technology like in the past. Maybe we are in an era where those can&#39;t happen anymore where as in the past they could.  I don&#39;t see real innovation now days.. just stagnation and incremental growth of established technologies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You mention Einstein but don&#39;t mention his critics at the time of his work, he wasn&#39;t just regarded as a hero universally. The same way you criticized Musk and Gates, people criticized Einstein&#39;s work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why was Einstein criticized? I don&#39;t know of major criticisms... I don&#39;t see them on the same level at all. I don&#39;t even see Jobs or Gates on the level of Henry Ford...</p>

<p>Again.. not because of who they are as people.. I am saying what they did was not as impressive as Ford at all. For was an incredible innovator... Jobs and Gates are more great businessmen who were in the right place at the right time where developing technology allowed them to capitalize on it and become incredibly successful because of it. Huge successes in business but not brilliant revolutionary thinkers.</p>
