        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m no fan of Trump—I didn&#39;t vote for him and have been extremely angry over many of his actions since the inaugural. That said, I think people need to understand that the world isn&#39;t black and white and that two sides are at war currently and they both have blood on their hands and have done egregious things. </p>

<p>The masses tend to treat political parties like sports teams and force individuals to be rabid fans and to always view the other side as always wrong—no matter what. You never defend the other team, even when they may be in the right. Most people in this subreddit I believe are aware that both political parties are false choices and that you can be critical of both—criticizing Trump doesn&#39;t make you a democrat and criticizing Obama doesn&#39;t make you a Trump supporter.</p>

<p>Given my distaste for Trump it would appear that I&#39;d be eager to believe in the Trump-Russia collusion narrative currently being pushed by the MSM and neoliberals. I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been evident to everyone here that the intelligence community has been corrupt for decades. The very people currently attacking Trump have been revealed to have lied in front of Congress—Clapper when Obama was still in office and Eric Holder who was held in contempt of Congress for lying to and misleading Congress and Michael Hayden who lied about the scope of US NSA mass surveillance, among others—yet we are now supposed to blindly have faith in them and believe what they say because some of us don&#39;t like Trump. We revert back to being rabid fans supporting what&#39;s good for our sports teams.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clearly evident that the Trump-Russia narrative is a witchhunt and people that dislike Trump are blindly going with it because the outcome may be to their liking and advantage.</p>

<p>Why is the Trump-Russia narrative a witchhunt? It&#39;s about whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government to hack the DNC servers and/or strategically release those hacked emails to hurt the Clinton campaign. We know the hack started in 2015 and Trump had to fight and claw the Republican nomination away from members of the RNC in the summer of 2016. It was never a guarantee that Trump would win the nomination—there was rapid talk of members of the RNC and Republicans mounting a way to take it away from him mere weeks before the convention in summer of 2016. The hacked information would have been released even if Cruz or Rubio had won because the information was already hacked before the nomination was even won. Regardless, Wikileaks would have gotten and released the information anyway. So would we be now talking about Cruz-Russia or Rubio-Russia collusion?</p>

<p>Talking to individuals from Russia isn&#39;t illegal. Rubio and then the Clinton campaign hired an ex British intelligence agent to talk to Russians and dig up dirt on Trump. How is that different than Trump Jr having a meeting in Trump Tower about supoosed dirt on Clinton aka opposition research? The Steele Dossier is opposition research from supposed Russian sources.</p>

<p>That said, this Flynn plea. There&#39;s been so much disinformation the last few days that has been nothing more than tabloid journalism. Gossip. Like Flynn facing decades in prison when the sentence for lying to the FBI holds a maximum 5-6 year sentence. All the false rumors of Flynn pointing fingers at Kushner and others. You know what I would do if I didn&#39;t like Trump and wanted to take him down and was in the intelligence community? Throw enough false misleading disinformation out there that it seems to the masses who barely pay attention to the news that there is a lot of smoke there and thus there must be a fire. It&#39;s been the tactic this entire year. Trump firing Flynn in February for simply lying to Pence never made logical sense on its face. </p>

<p>If Trump knew then in February  that Flynn had lied to the FBI about what he said to the Russian ambassador in late December of 2016 then he wouldn&#39;t be able to reveal it because it was obviously an undergoing investigation. Once the investigation was over and Flynn took the plea would be the only time he&#39;d legally be allowed to reveal that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI and that that was the <em>real</em> reason why he was fired. But now it&#39;s being spinned as Trump doing something nefarious and hiding the truth.</p>

<p>Throw the rumors of the supposed Turkish kidnapping plot out there to stir the waters and make Flynn lying—which was obviously known since February—seem even more nefarious.</p>

<p>Manafort was taken down for something he did prior to the campaign and years before the election. Nothing to do with collusion.</p>

<p>The question I do have is why Flynn lied? The Washington Post reporter David Ignatius reported in mid January—before the inaugural —on the phone calls Flynn had with the Russian ambassador. Yet in Flynn&#39;s interview with the FBI after the inauguration he chose to lie about things that had already had been reported about weeks before and it was already known that there were likely recordings of the phonecalls. So why still lie anyway? Maybe he willingly took the hit?</p>

<p>Why did George Papadopoulos lie? Maybe they thought Trump being president gave them cart blanche? Maybe they thought the investigation would deadend and didn&#39;t want to give authorities and the media any red meat to cause more of a storm?</p>

<p>Flynn talking to the Russian ambassador in late December 2016 was what other incoming administrations have done in the past. Nixon did it to Johnson and Reagan did it to Carter. Obama, for instance, did the same thing in 2008 before he officially became president. Was it against the Logan Act? Maybe, but the Logan Act has never been prosecuted and Flynn isn&#39;t being sentenced for talking to the Russian ambassador. He also spoke to ambassadors and members of other nations, not just from Russia. Is that a big deal when it happens AFTER the election and mere weeks before the inauguration?</p>

<p>So what have we got? Several members of the Trump campaign spoke to people from Russia and the Russian ambassador, which isn&#39;t illegal. Trump Jr having a meeting about opposition research on Clinton isn&#39;t illegal. Flynn talking to the Russian ambassador isn&#39;t illegal. Manafort goes down for things he did before the campaign. Flynn pleads not to anything related to collusion but to fibbing to the FBI.</p>

<p>Unless the Russian government hacked the DNC servers and told the Trump campaign exactly that and made a deal with them to release the information through Wikileaks then there is no collusion, regardless of how many times Jeff Sessions spoke to the Russian ambassador. </p>

<p>Currently there&#39;s a war going on between the Trump administration and the intelligence community. I don&#39;t trust Trump but I also don&#39;t trust the FBI. We know Comey wrote a memo exonerating Clinton before she was even interviewed and before the investigation was even over. Bill Clinton and Lynch met and made a deal on the tarmac. Bill Clinton is known to have deep ties to the CIA and intelligence community all the way back to his days as governor in Arkansas and likely has dirt on people and knows where certain skeletons are buried, figuratively speaking.</p>

<p>Is the FBI actually impartial? The Steele Dossier was published a mere week and a half before the inauguration. Strategic? The Russian ambassador&#39;s phones were tapped as a result of Trump winning the election—if Hillary had won then supposed Russian interference would have been a mute point. Mueller was given authority to go after <em>any</em> crime he may find while investigating supposed Trump-Russia collusion and that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s done—none of it has been about his main objective. Would any incoming administration and its former campaign members stand up to being investigated for anything and everything? If Clinton had won could she and her campaign have stood up to such scrutiny?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like Trump but if he falls Pence would be even worse because at least he&#39;s disciplined and discipline  coupled with Trump&#39;s policies would be a deadly combination. I get why democrats are desperately wanting there to be more <em>there</em> so impeachment can take place. I do. But a witchhunt is still a witchunt.</p>

<p>Hatred of Trump has people like Rachel Maddow going into straight tabloid journalism mode and connecting dots haphazardly like this is some sleuth mystery movie and it&#39;s unnerving to see the lengths many neoliberals will go to to force some semblance of evidence of supposed collusion. It&#39;s like all the anger about Obama being attacked for 8 years and Clinton&#39;s election loss is this seething frothing mass and it&#39;s time for revenge so people are grasping at straws.</p>

<p>Trump is corrupt. But so was Clinton and Obama and they and their footsoldiers got away with it while the Trump administration is facing the firing squad of the intelligence community because they aren&#39;t a part of that inner circle. So what we are seeing in the MSM and Trump&#39;s tweets is a war being waged. Both sides are corrupt liars and the situation is far from black and white. My point being is that we need to get out of this false notion one side is better or more trustworthy than the other. Don&#39;t pick a side but acknowledge the truth of what&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>The question I do have is why Flynn lied?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Although Flynn’s contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were listened to, Flynn himself is not the active target of an investigation, U.S. officials said.</p>

<p>[...] the call covered several subjects. They included a Russian invitation to the Trump administration to take part in Russian-sponsored Syrian peace talks that began Monday in Kazakhstan. The men also talked about logistics for a post-inauguration call between Trump and Russian President Vladi­mir Putin.</p>

<p>Flynn also conveyed condolences for a Russian plane crash that killed a famed military band the day before the call,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree. The burning question is Why is Flynn being charged with lying to the FBI over this?</p>

<p>His calls were public knowledge. </p>

<p>The intelligence communities actually had recordings of the calls and cleared them of any nefariousness.</p>

<p>Was he just entrapped with circuitous questioning, and caught on a technicality? Did he do lie on purpose? Is he really just plain dumb and lied for no reason?</p>

<p>There&#39;s things that aren&#39;t adding up.</p>

<p>Deputy Spokesperson Mark Toner</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He literally says he has zero problem with the President Elect team contacting anyone on their own, and he even offered that the State Department would help them make contact if they so chose to request the help.</p>

<p>Literally, what the fuck is going on? There&#39;s some fuckery afoot, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Russia.</p>

<p>There is a FBI/DOJ/Intelligence agency/White House civil war going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the FBI publicly clearing Flynn in the newspapers regarding the interview was an intentional lie? Maybe they didn&#39;t want to reveal it and tio their hand publicly while the investigation was still underway?</p>

<p>It makes no sense though. Flynn knew about the news reports about his December conversations with the Russian ambassador BEFORE the FBI interviewed him and knew there were likely tapes of the conversations and yet still chose to like to the FBI about it? He was the former head of the intelligence community as Director of National Intelligence so you would think he&#39;d be smarter than that? Maybe he was blackmailed? It doesn&#39;t add up. And none of it involves supposed Trump-Russia collusion.</p>

<li>#1 - On Jan 24 at the WH, @GenFlynn &#39;lied&#39; to the FBI about actions that were 100% legal (his meetings with Kislyak).</li>
<li>Flynn is a master spook. He knew his &#39;lies&#39; were being recorded. Why would you like about something that was legal?
Answer: Flynn WANTED them recorded. He did it deliberately.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not taking a pro Trump stance.  I&#39;m trying to piece together the crazy shit going on.  I mean why would Sessions have such smirky attitude during the hearing and pause on questions and smile afterward? Why have we seen a Dossier go from Republican hands to Clinton Campaign to later be funded by FBI and other parties and it be used in the investigation? Why would Clinton be interrogated by FBI without being sworn in, no transcript and on a holiday weekend?  Why would Flynn lie over something so stupid with his credibility then plea guilty for a process crime and accept a plea bargain?  Why would Mueller offer him a plea bargain? How does the Dossier play into the unmasking of FISA warrants?  All of this has been thought through and calculated.  I mean Trump team is under scrutiny and being outsiders have it more so.  The tweet from his attorney was so stupid.  Then I read that the OIG is concluding its investigation.  In my head I think that maybe just maybe Sessions has dirt on Mueller through this investigation or on the FBI.  If so, could this be more of an information war going on and a rope has been given to the other party to hang themselves or do what is right or negotiate?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sessions is only smirking when getting softball questions. When asked real questions, he stammers and rambles and fails to recall.</p>

<p>Republicans started funding the dossier, Clinton chipped in when it was clear who the Republican candidate would be, and Steele offered to sell the intel to the FBI.</p>

<p>You got me on Clinton. I was disappointed that she had such a lack interrogation. Though without another presidential candidate being interrogated by the FBI, we can&#39;t absolutely say if she got special treatment or not.</p>

<p>Flynn lying is because there&#39;s more to the story than has been publicly revealed, but it&#39;s not Flynn holding the cards. And accepting the plea means there are more serious charges that can be brought against him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is the questions asked that he paused on that are the most telling.  Your right he smirks like keebler elf.  I want to choke the guy sometimes.  </p>

<p>Republicans started the dossier clinton paid 900x what republicans did - then Obama Admin and then FBI chipped in 50k.  The life of that document alone is really crazy. I want to read it. </p>

<p>Clinton not only had lack interrogation - she wasn&#39;t sworn in..no transcript.  We have FBI agent who is anti-trump leading the investigation of 650k emails with an anti trump attorney. 
 We have Comey drafting a memo announcing Clinton&#39;s innocent of wrong doing before the investigation concluded.  The whole thing is a complete red flag. That doesn&#39;t even mention the political donations tied to FBI deputy.  I would say she without a doubt got special treatment.  She is Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>See I think Flynn lied purposely.  He is too smart to lie over a process crime.  Could be he has more dirt but he has dirt on a lot of people.  Why plea with Trump will pardon? I don&#39;t understand it.  Fun to watch and chat about it though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to White House Press Briefing - the republican candidates had process requirements. Trump team had high level campaign leaders go through background checks and the FBI along with Secret Service signed off on them.  Manafort was under investigation at the time he joined the Trump team.  They also knew of the dossier and had unmasked activity. How could the FBI not notify the Trump team? Were they afraid by doing so it could jeopardize the investigation? Did they use Manafort and the Dossier as reason to unmask surveillance? Doubt it.  One thing for sure, the strategy has been very interesting on both sides.  I think the lies were done purposely at times and other times out of stupidity.  Trump&#39;s team is under heavy scrutiny being outsiders.  If I had to place a bet.  Trump recorded the meeting with Comey.  He is wanting them to take the obstruction path.  OIG has dirt on FBI and Mueller.  They have handed them a rope to hang themselves or do the right thing. </p>

<p>You ever listen to SisterSouljah, AuntieJamamaB?   I’m being serious.   When I read this to myself I did it her voice and it sounded awesome and powerful.    360 Degrees of Power.   Love that album.    And I love hearing power in people’s voice if they need to speak up.    Humanity would flourish if it was allowed to mature spontaneously and freedom is essential, and society could be made more free in so many glorious and triumphant ways if we loved ourselves and our environment.    It wouldn’t ask permission or look for acceptance.   It would prove its merit at every opportunity and share its wisdom across all the disciplines.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>The Tribes Effect or Tribalism</strong></p>

<p>[There is] a powerful set of emotional dynamics that lure us deeper and deeper into this tribal mindset.  First, we get consumed in the vertigo-like frenzy of the conflict and lose sight of our broader purpose: is our goal to win the debate or improve human welfare? </p>

<p>Then, as the lines of division solidify, we reenact longstanding, counterproductive patterns of behavior to deal with the situation. This compulsion to repeat the past takes a familiar form: we dredge up historical grievances, interpret the other’s intentions as devious, and commit to the belief that their position will never change. Consequently, we execute an adversarial strategy and create the very enemy we feared. </p>

<p>To make matters worse, once this dynamics is at play, it becomes taboo for us to engage in constructive problem solving with the other side. Any such act is viewed as a betrayal of our tribe – and the punishment for such a breach can be severe. </p>

<p>The deepest forces of tribalism arise as we view the other’s rhetoric as an assault on what we hold as sacred. Nothing more intensely roils the fury of passion than a threat to our deepest beliefs and values. In fact, the savvy leader may intentionally invoke longstanding grievances into the contemporary political narrative to turn loose followers into tribal loyalists.</p>

<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>

<p>Whereas the tribes effect turns the nuances of conflict into a binary divide, a communal mindset opens up space for mutual understanding and creative problem solving. In this mindset, we aim to appreciate each other’s perspectives through an intense process of listening, mutual learning, and interaction. There is no need to come to agreement on the “right” viewpoint. The goal is to find merit in each other’s perspective and thus establish a foundation for moving forward together.</p>

<p>Social psychology offers a crucial insight to address this problem. <em>We can emotionally attach to a global identity with as much fervor as to a national one.</em> The core principle of identity formation remains the same: we imbue emotional significance to our membership in the group and commit loyalty to that entity.  In fact, there is no inherent tension in having every person on our planet identify as a citizen of the world, because the category of inclusion is so broad. </p>

<p>Problems tend to emerge as more localized identities clash, whether between nations or neighborhoods.  Mitigating such tension requires that our systems of global cooperation build a strong institutional sense of camaraderie while simultaneously ensuring that members feel sufficiently free to determine fundamental aspects of their provincial identity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re on the right track; basically it&#39;s Trump, the NSA, Military Intelligence, and his cabinet members, along with Mueller? Did you know Mueller recently pulled Comey&#39;s immunity deal? I thought they were friends... Trump met with Adm. Rogers, who got in trouble from Obama for not clearing it first; I think he met with him to maybe tell him what he knows about what the swamp has been up to, probably to tell him that he&#39;s on his side. He ended up being the only director of a 3 letter agency to not be replaced. Trump interviewed Mueller for the FBI Director job 2 days before he was named special counsel; he&#39;s already served in that position for 12 years and there&#39;s a 10 year limit, he wasn&#39;t eligible for the job he was interviewing for. Trump wanted to go after Clinton and the rest of them but he couldn&#39;t without making it look like he&#39;s using his power to jail a political appointment; if Mueller goes after her nobody can say anything. Flynn is a spymaster, he knows where the bodies are, but it would look pretty weird if he started helping the guy that&#39;s &quot;investigating&quot; Trump; well, now as part of his plea he <em>has</em> to help him.</p>

<p>Understand, I&#39;m not saying if all that&#39;s true that Trump is doing something wrong in going after Clinton; Mueller won&#39;t frame her for anything, he just figured out a way to get her investigated while keeping himself totally insulated from it so there can&#39;t be claims of impropriety.</p>

<p>But yeah, Mueller as special counsel can revoke immunity deals without asking or telling anyone at the DOJ, but it&#39;s rare for it to happen. If he pulled Comey&#39;s, with their history of being close colleagues, that would mean Comey did something seriously corrupt that he didn&#39;t admit to when they made the deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Trump Russia collusion goes much further than just leaked emails.</p>

<p>The whole (attempted) hacking of voting machines, the spreading of fake news and propaganda via social media, the &quot;accidentally&quot; leaving voter information on an unsecured server are also important aspects.</p>

<p>If it was just the emails, then yeah collusion might seem farfetched but if they did work with a foreign government and systemically targeted  voters via illicitly obtained data to spread propaganda and fake news and to use supposedly &quot;neutral&quot; organisations like Wikileaks to leak stolen emails at important moments in time (like when Trump came under fire for sexual harassment) so as to protect one candidate and, finally, that in return for these services president Trump would repeal sanctions or ignore important geo political issues ( like Ukraine), then you you&#39;ve got collusion.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t just focus on the emails. The theory goes much further than that.</p>

<p>If Hillary or Obama pulled that shit with, say, Israel, conservatives would be yelling 24/7.</p>

<p>We got a year long Republican Benghazi witch hunt with no crimes committed.</p>

<p>We had a fucking attempted impeachment with Clinton for lying about a blowjob.</p>

<p>But the Trump campaign meeting with Russians multiple times, DNC servers that were hacked, social media that was clearly abused by Russian psy ops and a whole lot of hacking and suspicious money transfers etc etc? FAKE NEWS WITCH HUNT.</p>

<p>If you can try to impeach someone for being a cheating horny president, maybe at least try to rule out whether your president was bought and paid for by a geopolitical adversary?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. I used the Clinton example to show how we held him to a high standard with regards to lying about sexual encounters and witness tampering yet this president had committed multiple acts of sexual assault, multiple members of his administration have lied on their security clearance forms, Trump constantly lies on Twitter and uses it to (try) to influence witnesses, members of his administration and campaign team lied to the FBI and Trump himself tried to influence Comey yet somehow it&#39;s a witch hunt and fake news. </p>

<p>You twist the argument to say this is as stupid as the Clinton impeachment thus making a false equivalence when this is more like watergate. So yeah not just a buzzword. </p>

<p>Your first link the method they use is people that vaguely agreed with things RT have said, So it&#39;s a bit of a joke. Also if you think 600 twitter accounts actually influenced the election... Lol</p>

<p>Your second link forces you to click through their source again and again eventually leading to surprise surprise fucking nothing but someone&#39;s word.</p>

<p>And the third one doesn&#39;t even try to provide any evidence the Russian goverment was involved. In fact their sources are from <em>Twitter</em>. The only thing Twitter could know abouts it&#39;s users are their IP addresses, So it seems like it&#39;s literally just some random Russian&#39;s posting some right leaning things &quot;misconstrued&quot; as a Russian governmental bot farm.</p>

<p>Oh so the GOP (Who is mostly part of the deepstate anyways btw) <em>purposely</em> leaked voter info for &quot;Social engineering&quot;(What a fucking joke of a thing tbh) that the Russian could use...

<p>Why must Russia be sanctioned exactly? Hmmmmm</p>

<p>Yeah why don&#39;t we just conveniently ignore them invading another country.</p>

<p>No this is referring to the same thing. Article is just using weird language.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. I&#39;m talking about his indicted campaign manager who had ties to Russia and was involved in the Ukraine business.</p>

<p>He was hired for like 2 months in the primaries and then fired when his use was done. And those things he did were <em>before</em> he was hired.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah we had an entire cold war with the precursor to the Russian federation</p>

<p>Yes a completely different government. And again in a different age.</p>

<p>and we still have worldwide sanctions against Russia but they&#39;re our ally, right?</p>

<p>&quot;Haha theirs no waaaaay a <em>deep-state</em> could exist that is controlling global governments and is targeting a country they don&#39;t control am I right fellow conspiracy theorist?&quot;</p>

<p>So yeah I sourced my argument with credible sources and facts. Want to do the same?</p>

<p>Fuck off with your bullshit. None of the things I said required sources. And literally zero of things you sourced provided any facts.</p>

<p>I have a simple fucking question for you. Why do you believe new agencies and governmental agencies that have been CAUGHT lieing and manipulating things on purpose? Because literally all your sources are relying on THEIR FUCKING WORDS.</p>

<p>Most of my comments are about Pizza gate actually. Not particularly many about Russia. And yes my account is a year old since I made it around election time. I get angry at all these manipulations I see and I debunk them, that&#39;s all.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say it was 100% certain they didn&#39;t, But I just find it doubtful considering all the other lies the government had been caught saying.</p>

<p>you believe in pizzagate, </p>

<p>Yes I believe people who use straight up pedo code words and have &quot;art&quot; of tortured kids in their underwear in their homes are pedos. In fact from how many strange circumstantial evidence their is it&#39;s easily over 99%. I&#39;m unsure why your getting angry at me for believing a conspiracy about a pedo network in a conspiracy subreddit.</p>

<p>Because none of the things I&#39;ve said needed sources. And you haven&#39;t specifically asked for any sources on anything either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good write-up. I don&#39;t disagree with anything in it but would like to add my own observations as a long time astute observer. I could be wrong about my observations, they could be influenced by wishful thinking, but while trying to stay objective I&#39;ve noticed the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Even though Trump is some form of elite, he appears sincere about stopping the mass importation of non-assimilating populations to the U.S. (and the West) which displaces a high iq freedom loving population (diverse in and of itself and strengthened by legal immigration) with a permanently dependent underclass that doesn&#39;t desire freedom of speech, guns, cannabis, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Making the u.s. more economically independent and successful while encouraging other nations to act within their own self interest (based on his u.n. speech and actions towards nations- except Iran where he&#39;s hawkish). </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know there is a lot to be desired.</p>

<p>Am I completely wrong in thinking while Trump is definitely not doing what Ron Paul would want to do (just come home from the middle east, defund the CIA, get rid of the IRS, etc) that he is in fact still trying to give the U.S. population more control over itself from globalist elites? Is this just a practical next step to populist conservative/ classical liberal/ libertarian views becoming more popular? Key word being &#39;practical,&#39; as much as I want the body politic of the West to fully wake up. Is Trump a baby step in the right direction? I&#39;m perfectly willing to hear other explanations just be nice.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right. The Trump Org has been structured as a money laundering organisation since the early 90&#39;s with Trump&#39;s Atlantic City casinos. It just wasn&#39;t as bad and outright untill Trump started directly working with the Russian and Kazak mafia during the Trump Soho development project.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should be asking why now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because Trump is the president and every single president since Carter has had their finances ripped apart with a fine tooth comb, as it should be. If the president and his family has been actively a part of Russian mafia laundering operations, something needs to be done about it. The Trump Org has stright up employed convicted Russian mafia associates, doesn&#39;t that give anyone any pause? Don&#39;t you think that intel agencies would have some concern with a president that outright employs Russian mob associates? He kept it under the radar for years by bribing assistant DA&#39;s in NY, but not any longer. He cannot hide it any more.</p>

<p>Nope, I can just see money laundering operations for what they are. </p>

<p>I am able to look into Trump Org partner&#39;s past and see their ties to Russian mob organisations like Trans World Group. I can find Trump Org employees that have been convicted for $40 million in stock fraud and stabbing people in the face. I can find out about Trump Org employees participating in a $30 million laundering operation in Cincinatti Ohio at the Tri County mall. I have wire transfer documents, I can see where the money comes from.</p>

<p>There were two Trump Org employees that participated in the Tri County Mall debt laundering operation. You may already know Felix Sater, but Daniel Ridloff was also a Trump Org employee that participated in the operation to launder about $30 million in Khrapunov and Ablyazov cash. </p>

<p>Both Sater and Ridloff initially came from Bayrock and participated in the Trump Soho laundering operation. They then went to the Trump Org, where they were employed for acquisition and finance. They then participated in several laundering operations with Khrapunov and Ablyazov cash.</p>

<p>You keep repeating &quot;Trump Org employee&quot; which is factually untrue.</p>

<p>Felix Sater was employed by the Trump Org. He has a <a href="http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/abc_sater_card_lf_151130.jpg">business card</a> from the organisation, he also listed working at the Trump Org on <a href="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2461227.1449760232!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/mafia11n-2-web.jpg">his linkedin</a>. If you look at the other positions on his LinkedIn page, he also listed as an advisor to TxOil, one of the two firms involved in the Tri-County Mall laundering operation.</p>

<p>Ridloff was employed by the Trump Org. He has the position listed on his <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Bo3tK">LinkedIn page</a> as well as other <a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Daniel-Ridloff/1563181710">contact pages</a>. If you look further into his contact pages, he lists himself as the VP of SDG Investments, which is the  second of two firms involved in the Tri County mall laundering operation.</p>

<p>And before you go saying that the Tri County activities have nothing to do with Trump and Sater and Ridloff were not employed by the Trump Org during that time period, consider that Ridloff and Sater were actively laundering Khrapunov cash and using Trump Soho to purchase $3.1 million of condos in Trump Soho. Those purchases made in Trump Soho were made  to assist in failed attempts at getting the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3898563-World-Health-Networks-Visa-Applications.html#document/p2">Khrapunov&#39;s investor visas, sponsored by Daniel Ridloff</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Bill Clinton is known to have deep ties to the CIA and intelligence community all the way back to his days as governor in Arkansas and likely has dirt on people and knows where certain skeletons are buried, figuratively speaking.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be willing to wager that there&#39;s nothing <em>figurative</em> about that...</p>

<p>But so was Clinton and Obama and they and their footsoldiers got away with it while the Trump administration is facing the firing squad of the intelligence community because they aren&#39;t a part of that inner circle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congrats for being the least retarded trump hater that has replied to my comment.  Hell, i’ll even throw you an upvote for offering a good argument, even us Trumpkins need to be kept in check incase the entire thing is a scam and trump is a tool of the NWO to sow mass division amonst the masses however unlikely that may be at this point. If i just got elected president i would be ordering meetings with the russains left and right to help forge a healthy relationship with the russians during my admisistration which would be good for america and good for my presidency. By the way, the only thing trunp has said about the matter is NO COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIANS to STEELE (lol) the ELECTION FROM KNOWN NWO MOLOCH WORSHIPER HILLARY CLINTON. Okay I added some things in for dramatic effect just like you did but you get my point? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I voted for Clinton, begrudgingly. Take me to the woodshed. Be my guest. I did so because I fell into the trap of believing that there were only two options and I couldn&#39;t bring myself to vote for the reality tv star. I basically set down and asked myself if Abraham Lincoln would roll over in his grave or not at the sight of someone like Trump in the presidency? I contemplated that and came back with an <em>affirmative</em>. I should have done a right in vote for Bernie Sanders. Sanders is who I wanted. Knowing what I know now I know the two political parties are false choices and that voting for either is the real wasted vote. I despised Hillary but gritted my teeth and voted for what I thought was the best option of the two main choices. These last two years have enlightened me—and millions of others—to new things in terms of politics. I thought I knew a lot already—and I did, more than most—but it was like I was redpilled or went down the rabbit hole, so to speak.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I wrote about this in my initial post. It&#39;s obvious Trump fired Flynn in February over his lying to the FBI and that he couldn&#39;t legally reveal such until the underlying investigation was through. The whole thing about Flynn being fired for lying to Pence was PR and never made logical sense to begin with. Of course Trump knew that Flynn lied because that&#39;s why Flynn was actually fired. </p>

<p>And interesting enough the day after Flynn was fired Trump supposedly met with Comey and told him: &quot;I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” </p>

<p>Flynn&#39;s firing wasn&#39;t about Trump-Russia collusion. The FBI investigation into Flynn was about him <em>lying</em> to the FBI about what he had said to the Russian ambassador, not about him merely  <em>talking</em> to the ambassador. The lying—whether it was a misstep or on a technicality isn&#39;t clear—is what Trump was supposedly referencing to in that conversation with Comey. &quot;The guy fibbed a little bit but he&#39;s been fired so give him a break if you can.&quot; Knowing how Trump thinks he probably thought that because  Comey gave Clinton a pass that maybe he&#39;d do the same for Flynn and he calculated wrong.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>O, I agree. Trump firing Comey was a huge egregious error. Bannon and others have confessed as much. He played the wrong hand and got burnt. Trump is his own worst enemy much of the time. Whether or not Trump could be construed to have obstructed justice however doesn&#39;t mean the Trump-Russia collusion narrative is viable and tangible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyway the investigation started long before anyone other than his 
supporters thought he could even win, so the idea that it is a witch hunt to scupper his presidency makes no sense. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve lost me. The FBI investigation into Russian interference started in July of 2016. That isn&#39;t the same as the investigation into supposed Trump-Russia collusion. And Trump won the Republican nomination in July 2016. You are conflating that with the hack of the DNC servers which the FBI had supposedly warned the DNC about as early as late 2015. So you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you assume that his guilty then a lot of things start to make sense. Why everyone in the trump campaign keeps lying and changing their stories about their contacts with russia, some of them even lying to the FBI, which is a crime. Why Trump during and after the campaign has been so nice to Russia and Putin. Why Trump keeps trying to shut the investigation down instead of just letting it run its course. He acts like a guilty person trying to cover their tracks. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I call it hubris. A rich man that isn&#39;t use to being questioned and having to answer to anyone isn&#39;t going to suddenly like doing so at age 70.</p>

<p>And why has the FBI never independently verified the hack into the DNC servers and relied on the findings of CrowdStrike, instead, which Comey admitted to while under questioning in front of Congress?</p>

<p>Why not be nice to Russia? In 2012 Obama was laughing off Mitt Romney&#39;s claims of Russia being an existential threat to the US. Bush was downright chummy with Putin. Strategically it would be in the US&#39;s interest to cooperate with the other big world superpower with nukes. What, are we going to lob insults and start a war over Facebook ads and Twitterbots?</p>

<p>Maybe Trump was backed by Russian money in the 90s and doesn&#39;t want that revealed? Maybe the Clinton campaign found that out and held it in the rare chance (they thought) that they&#39;d lose the election? Maybe the Clinton campaign paid for the Steele Dossier as a backup plan to help muddy the waters in case god forbid she happened to lose the election?</p>

<p>I can find articles in the Post and other major newspapers stating that it isn&#39;t rare for people to leave off contacts and associations off paperwork for a security clearance and much of the time it is viewed as a formality. People going back and amending the paperwork is routine.</p>

<p>I can find articles in the Washington Post from 2014 stating that the ability to attribute a hack to the actual entity that did the hacking is near impossible yet suddenly we are all certain—with no evidence, mind you—that Russia hacked the DNC servers. The servers that the FBI has never even looked at.</p>

<p>I believe what&#39;s going on is a war and Trump is ill equipped and ill suited to handle the task and has bungled opportunities time and again. That&#39;s why he had surrounded himself by generals and the Pentagon and meets with CIA head Pompeo almost daily.  It&#39;s not black and white. The FBI aren&#39;t suddenly the good guys because you believe Trump to be a bad guy. He&#39;s learning while on the job and political infighting has hit the MSM.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has no ideology. I mean he ran on draining the swamp. His cabinet is stuffed full of swamp people. I don&#39;t think he would bother trying to fight a war with FBI/Intelligence people. Look how easily he rolled over for the establishment GOP. The only reason he is at odds with these people is because of the fact that he doesn&#39;t like the Russia investigation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe he despises the leadership of the GOP but has been forced to deal with them. He hired Reince Preibus as his chief of staff as an appeasement to the Republican establishment and the GOP and it backfired on him. I believe he was as shocked as anyone on election night when he won and that he&#39;s been learning while on the job ever since. I believe the Clintons and the Obama administration have their people in the intelligence agencies and are enacting revenge for the election loss with the leaks and propaganda leaked to CNN and the Washington Post. </p>

<p>I see your point. Trump is like a cheerleader for the rich and multi-national corporations and is actively putting forth policies that will fuck over a lot of the poor and middle class. I agree. Obama also was a cheerleader for capitalism and bailed out the rich and the banks and the corporations while fucking over the little man but he did it with charisma and panache so it was an easier pill to swallow. Trust me, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi don&#39;t give a fuck about the poor and middle class—they only ever do so when it suits them and makes a nice PR moment. You just have to watch what Schumer said about raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour last year and others topics last year vs this year. The stuff he&#39;s now championing are the things he was laughing off and calling pipedreams just last year because he thought Clinton was going to win the presidency. The democrat party doesn&#39;t give a fuck about you and that should have been evident when they cheated Bernie out of the nomination.</p>

<p>He&#39;s corrupt as the day is long. Many of his policies are hurting the country and are damning the supposed &quot;forgotten men and women&quot; he championed during his inaugural address. That you have faith in him at all any more speaks more to your naïveté and lack of foresight than anything else. Which doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t have some policies that are right and some positions that are right. He&#39;s a con man who is there as a cheerleader for the rich and multi-national corporations. </p>

<p>Malicious operators work in very segregated organizational structures to avoid suspicion and concentrate power at the top of the hierarchy (traditional secret society tactic). Those structures can all be easily identified by the NSA. The NSA has so much fucking power to process information, and NSA operators can acquire a very high level view of organizations, structures, and hierarchies. Without being &quot;introduced&quot; to those groups. This scares the shit out of the CIA, because the CIA is just a puppet arm of something else entirely. And the NSA knows that too. Hence, are we seeing the reaction of the master flailing out with his tool? Does this mean the NSA actually stands a decent chance of destroying the master? Or is it all another trick..</p>

<p>Michael Hayden was former head of the NSA and appears on CNN and MSNBC weekly. Is the NSA truly at war with the CIA? I doubt it.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also not a fan of either Trump or Clinton - but I do know at least HRC can play the game.</p>

<p>What I also know is the IC has never been in agreement with itself;  all 3 letter agencies scramble to validate their various programs and methodologies - every year money is earmarked to develop, or continue operations on, a capability that already exists. </p>

<p>State Department - 20% black budget - CIA</p>

<p>Defense Department - 80% black budget - DIA</p>

<p>When Flynn was DIRDIA, G2 of Army before that, he was trying to create his own HUMINT network, in order to be less reliant on CIA equities.  With 80% of the black budget going to DOD operations, it was well within his ability to do so.  Agency only controls about 20% of the black budget, most of which is focused on geopolitical/economic intelligence - this doesn&#39;t lend much help to the guy on the ground wearing a flag, or even the unwashed special forces detachments running around causing trouble - BUT they also run the drone programs, which do get contracted for DOD requirements, usually kinetics and situational awareness.  Obama didn&#39;t like the idea of DOD resourcing their own intel outside the management of the Whitehouse, so he allowed Flynn&#39;s Deputy Director (former Agency) to block development.  It was scandalous.</p>

<p>Trump brought out &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; mantra in full force, as he is a clear and present threat on the institution.  He inadvertently reunited all the cousins and they feel insulted. </p>

<p>On Flynn - he was told to speak to the Russians by Trump, without a doubt.  Flynn was thrown under the bus and then agreed to fall on his sword like a good soldier.  A very sad end to one of the Army&#39;s greatest intel officers.  He got caught up among the Trump train on his way to vindicate his earlier attempts at bolstering DIA HUMINT as the new National Security Advisor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems logical. Given that wouldn&#39;t Trump&#39;s firing of Comey have been a misstep? Flynn took the hit as a loyal soldier but then Trump himself played a wrong hand and in firing Comey brought Mueller on board with a directive to uncover any crime? Mueller was the longest serving FBI Director since Hoover and was on the job when 9/11 happened and throughout the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>In my opinion he is digging his own grave.  Like you&#39;ve said, Mueller is a man of the Institution and every move Trump makes is a personified middle-finger to Mueller&#39;s values.</p>

<p>Trump is not a savior, nor is he a champion for the middle-class.  He is a fly by the seat of my pants draft-dodger, who wishes to be a wartime president with his generals around a table advising him.  They are clearing the Korean Peninsula of US personnel as we speak.  This could very well turn into a nuclear exchange w NKOREA.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lot of really good points in there. Nice write-up. A few comments:</p>

<p>| The question I do have is why Flynn lied?</p>

<p>This is the big question. It&#39;s said that Flynn knew all things, but legitimately, maybe Flynn really did forget and get bit? Occam&#39;s Razor. It&#39;s a pretty crazy time. Also, it&#39;s quite likely that he and/or his son were tripped up somewhere like the Turkey money and this was the deal they were able to work. </p>

<p>| Maybe he willingly took the hit?</p>

<p>This is the theory he knew all things and could end with Trump pardoning him and clearing his name once everything is out in the open. I&#39;m less optimistic on this option but it is sad to me to consider a General with 33 years being turned into a felon without gun or voting rights. </p>

<p>| Why did George Papadopoulos lie? </p>

<p>Again, useful to consider the obvious; he&#39;s 29 and just as dumb as most 29-year-olds? Or potentially a DNC plant to further the Russia narrative? How did Clovis come to know him to recommend him? </p>

<p>| Is the FBI actually impartial? The Steele Dossier was published a mere week and a half before the inauguration. Strategic? The Russian ambassador&#39;s phones were tapped as a result of Trump winning the election—if Hillary had won then supposed Russian interference would have been a mute point.</p>

<p>I think the answer is &#39;no&#39; and that will become more apparent over the coming days as more FBI agents are implicated for bias and McCabe&#39;s obvious conflict of interest continues to be pushed into the narrative. The question is who investigates the investigators? That answer appears to be <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/press/2017/2017-01-12.pdf">OIG</a> and now they are finishing up their report details are starting to leak including the Strzok story and early rumors of others.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth remembering that both the House and Senate have their own investigations also around other poor choices the FBI has made like hiding Strzok and threatening the Uranium Informant so these things might go to a case against the FBI and what appears to be corruption and cover-up at the core of the FBI. </p>

<p>Also noteworthy in that Flynn and McCabe were already mortal enemies due to Flynn&#39;s unusual intervention on behalf of Supervisory Special Agent Robyn Gritz in her sexual harassment case against McCabe. </p>

<p>For fun, you can guess why Flynn Jr. would tweet out <a href="https://twitter.com/mflynnJR/status/927212820378390528">this pic</a> of his Dad with Mueller, Clapper and Brennan and tell folks to &quot;go nuts with your comments&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in agreement with your points.  However I read something interesting in a Politico article from July of 2016 about the OIG investigation.

<li>Flynn is a master spook. He knew his &#39;lies&#39; were being recorded. Why would you like about something that was legal?
