        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s been two months, and the Vegas event seems to already be forgotten. There&#39;s still no motive, no explanation for the leaked crime scene photos, nothing on his girlfriend. Nothing about why large hospitals stopped receiving patients before they were even full, instead diverting victims to smaller more poorly equipped hospitals. No explanation for the mystery man escorted away by heavily armed police. Or about the Reno shooting that took place on the 29th in a condo that Stephen Paddock had owned property in as recently as December 2016, or the mysterious female &quot;hostage&quot; that was in the room during the shooting. &quot;During the shooting, Stone held a woman hostage while he was firing sporadically, five to eight shots at a time for roughly 30 minutes.&quot; Nobody was killed other than the shooter, and there were at most two injuries. Coincidence? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, according to their official statement.  No.  Swat found him dead and he was identified and that there was no further issues.  Yet, there’s video on YouTube of Mandalay Bay employees terrified and hiding in their stores then exported to the Michael Jackson theater by officers all with assault rifles.  Which they kept the lights off and 45 minutes later told everyone to hit the floor which caused ppl to panic and cry.   Before the finally evacuated the theater and put everyone on a bus out of the area.  They didn’t let them go back and get their personal things till the next day.   I can dm you a link if you’d like.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just FYI... only 1 SWAT officer entered the room. Apparently they waited a full hour and the other 19 SWAT officers on his team were too busy to show up. He went in with 4 other officers from the LVMPD. Sorry, don&#39;t mean to be picky... But, this is a problematic fact that needs addressed I think too many people are ignoring. No offense. Just wanted to get it out there... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re not talking about &quot;every inch of every place in history,&quot; numb nuts, we&#39;re talking about Las fucking Vegas in front of 20,000 witnesses (which means about 20,000 recording devices) at a music festival. </p>

<p>Yet no one can show anything which has been shot. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t have to &quot;prove it.&quot; The claim is that hundreds of people were shot with thousands of high cal rifle rounds. This is the claim with the burden of proof on it and which has not been proven to any convincing degree. </p>

<p>If this were a real shooting you could save your fingers and just link to a dozen images of bullet damage, gunshot wounds, and actual medical treatment. But of course you cannot. </p>

<p>And yeah I like #1 that you mentioned because they act like there&#39;s all this evidence and proof that people were shot and then when I ask for any all they can do is say &quot;just Google it&quot; (which I obviously have) and assure me that it&#39;s so abundant and convincing, yet they can&#39;t even show one link or image or time stamp that shows anything being shot or even that has been shot. </p>

<p>Where if it was a real shooting on the scale claimed, they could simply show a video of bullets impacting or a large area of bullet damage or people being worked on by EMS or any blood or injuries.

<p>I actually do believe it was a real shooting, but I&#39;m interested in talking about it and not just shutting people down. I want to know all possible perspectives and make my own decision what is most plausible. And the things you mention are all plausible to me.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, the number of people who claim to have personal connections to victims who are arguing with random people like me about it on r/conspiracy is simply too damn high. I do not exaggerate when I say I have had over twenty people on this forum make such a claim. Naturally not all of them can be telling the truth, just on a basic mathematical level. None of them have offered any proof other than linking to some random Facebook post or news article that I could have found on my own. </p>

<p>So if at least some of them are liars, it begs the question of why there would need to be people on a conspiracy forum spreading these lies. We know there are crisis actors involved -- one of the girls claiming there were multiple shooters was formerly on Dr Phil for example, playing an out of control narcissist. This begs the same question, of why there would need to be actors in the wake of a real shooting. </p>

<p>There are many reasons to doubt any shots were fired and no good reasons to think anyone got shot. We should have a pastiche of photos and videos that all show rivers of blood, gruesome carnage, windows shot out, people being treated by EMTs on the scene, etc. and there is nothing like this. </p>

<p>There are four main videos people point to when they do attempt to offer &quot;proof&quot; that people were shot instead of just downvoting or launching a personal attack: the liveleak &quot;aftermath&quot; video, the video of people arriving at an emergency room, a video of a cup being kicked over that they say is being shot, and a guy with blood or fake blood on his arm. </p>

<p>None of the above show any real injuries or medical activity. They are clearly staged. The one in the emergency room shows no blood when there should be tracks and smears of it everywhere. </p>

<p>Las Vegas is one of the world&#39;s most video surveilled cities. 20,000 people were said to be present at the concert and probably thousands of them had recording devices which were active at the time. Yet we have no footage of a bullet striking anything. </p>

<p>Let alone the fact that the victims have been made-up, and even have phony sounding made up names to go with their contrived identities. </p>

<p>One &quot;witness&quot; named Mike Cronk (see what I mean about the stupid names) claimed his &quot;buddy&quot; was shot three times in the chest and survived. Anyone who thinks a high powered rifle, tripod or no tripod (and there was no tripod), could hit the same target three times over hundreds of yards from a height of 32 stories is living in a television fantasy world. The slightest recoil of the gun barrel translates into much vaster deviations of the bullets over that distance. Yet there he is, making this bullshit claim on CNN. I can link to the video of this right now, and it&#39;s enough to prove we have a hoax. </p>

<p>This just doesn&#39;t have the three dimensional appearance and flavor of a real shooting, on any level of scrutiny. I have many links I could share that further debunk the entire charade but here&#39;s a good discussion to listen to while you drive or chill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a well reasoned argument. I get what you mean about not having the three dimensional appearance of a real shooting. It seems produced. Like details are intentionally left out because they would detract from the narrative. In one of the videos I saw I think there was even some on screen direction. That might be the live leak video you mention. </p>

<p>I honestly don’t know what to think, man. Part of me wants to just believe it happened as told, and the other part keeps seeing things that don’t add up. When I come to forums like this to get answers, some of the rebuttals are downright hostile. I keep holding out hope that the official report will make sense when it drops, and will clean up some of the inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Here’s an idea I had re: crisis actors. I heard they are often recruited on Craigslist. There can’t be an incredibly huge number of them in the US... What if someone were to post fake ads on Craigslist, soliciting crisis actors for an upcoming production, and asked aspiring extras to reply with their headshot, an example or 2 of their work, and resume?

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I was the one trying to hype it up but it got nowhere. My own investigations found that, according to police, Stone was shooting at &quot;targets which did not exist&quot; and my speculation is that the hostage was a woman who worked for an NPR related radio station. The officers took at least 36 hours informing the family and subsequently the media of the identity of the shooter. The shooter had no criminal history (once again) and was not a big gun nut. He was on the eighth floor of the Montage facing the east side whereas Paddock lived on the 15th floor facing the west side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the biggest bullshit remarks is the &quot;200 rounds at a security guard&quot; claim. 
.223 would go flying through that door, through the next door across the hallway, and possibly continue through that next wall as well. 
200 of those were fired off? In a hotel environment? Absolutely laughable. That door would be toast. </p>

<p>Police reports claim that they had to evacuate adjacent rooms. No one can attest one way or another to 200 rounds being casually fired at a security guard? Who sustained a minor leg wound from what would be nearly 7 standard capacity magazines?</p>

<p>Furthermore, they claim that there were cameras set up by the &quot;shooter&quot; both inside the room, and the hallway. Why has none of this surfaced?</p>

<p>Why did he have access to the freight elevator? Why is there no footage of this happening?</p>

<p>My biggest concern is that round count allegation. As someone who uses the .223 caliber round frequently, that just doesn&#39;t make sense. 
I&#39;m not usually a tinfoil hat kinda guy, but I heard that and was instantly suspicious. 
I was out of the country at the time and thought it was just a foreign news source misquoting, but nope... we are really going with 200 rounds through a hotel door. </p>

<p>Why can&#39;t the LVPD hold a press conference and instead of saying &quot;The shooter shot over 1100 rounds.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m inclined to believe someone is just messing with him but until Vegas, I never watched anything like this. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s making it up for nefarious reasons. Lots of these YouTube people are constantly asking for $ but he only briefly mentions it at the end of his videos (which I think is fair). And, I heard Laura Loomer slashed her own tires for attention. But, from what I could see from his neighborhood, it looks like he&#39;s doing pretty well money wise and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a matter of attention seeking. He&#39;s not above giving away his research to other YouTube journalists without taking credit. I respect that as it appears he really cares about just getting the info out there.</p>

<p>I only watch his videos on Vegas though. LOL, so... basically to answer your question... I have no idea! </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to post about the pharmacist connection on here as much as possible b/c that&#39;s really something. There&#39;s no denying actual titles with those two as co-owners. Not sure about all the interviews he&#39;s been doing with the high rollers because witnesses can be pretty unreliable. But, to be honest, I&#39;m just happy someone who&#39;s not an attention seeking, greedy nut is still covering the story. </p>

<p>I just try to keep an open mind and cross my fingers he doesn&#39;t give up on it or, God forbid, something does happen to him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been trying to find a podcast where someone is still talking about the attack. Most recent one was just 2 weeks after the shooting. But if I find something I&#39;ll let you know. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what to make of the 2 shooters theory. I believe it&#39;s possible. But, I&#39;m not buying there were shooters in a helicopter. I kind of think the Saudi theories are a bit out there. </p>

<p>As of now, it&#39;s my opinion half of the information being kept under wraps is simply MGM trying to cover their asses in future litigation. The other half of me thinks Paddock was involved in some kind of illegal dealings. Maybe drugs, guns... like the Uber driver said, there&#39;s many criminals that approach guys like Paddock who have connections to other players. I don&#39;t necessarily think he was involved with the FBI (I have some trouble and questions about the whole FBI sting Paddock as a CI theory... still possible I suppose). In any case, with the FBI investigating his brother, there&#39;s no way they hadn&#39;t investigated Paddock and his family. They definitely had some knowledge of what he was doing and this is why we aren&#39;t getting any answers from them either. </p>

<p>Because I&#39;m new to this whole cover up conspiracy thing, I&#39;m still thinking analytically.... trying to reach the most &quot;believable&quot; conclusion. However, since this story broke it&#39;s been getting weirder and weirder. If someone really did find evidence of a Saudi assassination, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be all that surprised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I&#39;m exactly like you. I&#39;ve only found a few podcasts that talk about Las Vegas. One was recorded two days after so they didn&#39;t have much info, Joe Rogan completely dismissed any other theory than the official story, and the other podcast used numerology to analyze the shooting, which I can&#39;t get behind at all.</p>

<p>The fire from the helicopter is out of the window for me. The &quot;muzzle flashes&quot; people are seeing on the videos are just a special type of strobes helicopters have in busy areas. But you cannot dismiss the helicopter activity itself. The radar from that night is strange, very strange. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t let go of the 2 shooters theory. I was in the military. I&#39;ve heard a fair amount of machine gun fire from the receiving end, and I can&#39;t get over my instincts that say there is two weapons being fired. Also, the taxi cab footage is just too damming audio wise. People say that far away sounding volley of fire is an echo. I tried going with that, but after watching dozens of times, that is a second position of fire.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so many moving parts to this. It&#39;s fascinating. The man being escorted from the Tropicana. The video of someone lifeless on the casino floor of the Delano. Campos going missing after the shooting. Idk, I desperately want to know the truth, but chances are we never will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your unique perspective. This is what we (or at least I) need... more educated opinions about that night. Because I&#39;ve seen so many videos that either support or deny the 2nd shooter theory and I&#39;ve never even touched a gun. So, I have no clue. I do think it&#39;s pretty weird there were 2 windows broken out and it&#39;s almost impossible to explain why the adjacent door was locked from the other side after he &quot;killed himself.&quot; I&#39;ve talked to several people at work who think it&#39;s possible we aren&#39;t being told about certain things because there&#39;s another person still out there. There&#39;s one video that vaguely shows another body in the hotel room leaked photos. I can see it, but it&#39;s like one of those photos where you see one thing but then look at it another way and it&#39;s something completely different. However, if the FBI had killed 2 people in the room, I don&#39;t know why they would want to cover that up... Then again, never in my life have I seen anything like this whole mess. </p>

<p>The fact Lombardo gave such differing timelines and answers that contradicted himself, doesn&#39;t make things any better. If he simply fucked up and gave out info before he knew the right answers, was pressured by the FBI/MGM or something else entirely only fuels the fire. But, man, I was so disappointed when they discontinued those press conferences. </p>

<p>I have a legal background (not a lawyer but studied criminology), so I know for sure MGM isn&#39;t releasing the videos because it simply implicates them. Stuff like that can be easily explained. Not that hard to believe a huge company like MGM would just hand attorneys more ammunition (unintentional pun). </p>

<p>So where do you think those helicopters were going/doing? That military place a couple YouTube ppl visited are only making themselves look suspicious by refusing to answer questions. </p>

<p>And, I&#39;m right on board with you. I look for something new everyday. Regardless of how (or anyone) feels about Tucker Carlson, he&#39;s the only real media figure that&#39;s keeping this whole thing going. I wish he&#39;d done more than 7 minutes the other day. Kind of saddened by the fact Jake hasn&#39;t released anything about Vegas recently. Hopefully, he&#39;s just onto something and piecing it together for a new video. Hey, I&#39;m going to save your username just in case something comes about, however vague... because I feel like we&#39;re pretty much on the same page here and both up to date. Plus, both kind of obsessed with this topic!  </p>

Well, what if every day Tucker said something like &quot;it&#39;s been x days since the Vegas massacre and the police still have not given us a motive or shown us a single video of the perpetrator at Mandalay Bay or anywhere in Vegas the week of the shooting.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work at a restaurant with a girl who just took a job in loss prevention for Kohl’s. Her boss showed her that they could pull up the cameras on the parking lot and zoom over to the wal mart in the neighboring parking lot and zoom in enough to read tags on cars. In the store they could zoom in enough to make out the logo’s on purses as well as shoes. There is no way that the security footage in Vegas doesn’t show the faces of those involved in enough detail that you couldn’t plaster them on the news and have ppl identify them. I understand it’s an ongoing investigation but come on, something is up and the public needs to know what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes I think the general public does know there&#39;s something VERY wrong with this story, but no one in the MSM (with the exception of TC) ever talks about it-- because they have nothing to report except &quot;It&#39;s been X amount of months and we still don&#39;t know anything about Las Vegas.&quot; </p>

<p>Therefore, &quot;regular people&quot; don&#39;t have a place to voice their outrage (comments sections, etc.). So, it&#39;s sort of a chain of stupidity and ignorance... </p>

<p>FBI--&gt;LVPD--&gt;MSM--&gt;PUBLIC</p>

<p>If this was a more prevalent story, I do think more people would be asking questions. Instead, no one cares because they can&#39;t remember. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the problem is trying to sort out what&#39;s being covered up because of legal culpability and an illegal cover-up (hopefully you know what I mean). </p>

<p>For instance, questions surrounding lack of footage re: Paddock entering MB and using the freight elevator seems like MB just covering their ass in the event any of these lawsuits go to court. Eventually, they will HAVE TO hand them over. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the TWO smashed windows and locked interior door are an entirely different story (among MANY other things). </p>

<p>To make things even more confusing, some of the questions overlap. In the case of Jose Campos, I can definitely see why he was placed on Ellen and hidden away-- He&#39;s a major reason MGM could lose millions. But, the lack of time stamp and distress call sound are beyond fishy.    </p>
