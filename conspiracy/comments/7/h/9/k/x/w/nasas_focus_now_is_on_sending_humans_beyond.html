<p>Which ones?  180 of the 270 moon rocks &quot;brought back&quot; have gone missing and the other 90 are not allowed to be studied and analyzed by researchers.</p>

<p>The reason is obvious, moon rocks can be found on earth and it is also well known that these rocks are virtually indistinguishable from NASA’s collection of Moon rocks and actual testing would prove that they too have gone through our atmosphere </p>

<p>The data on the moon is very small. You could mine things on it. You could build bases on it. You could do a lot of things on it. Jesus christ as an engineer you aren&#39;t the sharpest tool in the shed bud. What are you like 20?</p>
