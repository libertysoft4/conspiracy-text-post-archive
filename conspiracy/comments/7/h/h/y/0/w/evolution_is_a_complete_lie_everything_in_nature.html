        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Evolution is a complete lie. Nature itself is a fractal. Why would you be any different?  The earth is not evolving. The earth is actually a fractal of their original sources. Look into the Mandelbrot Set to begin to understand what a fractal is, then dig deeper. Everything about evolution is b.s.</p>

<p>Approximate fractals found in nature display self-similarity over extended, but finite, scale ranges. The connection between fractals and leaves, for instance, is currently being used to determine how much carbon is contained in trees.</p>

<p>Phenomena known to have fractal features include:</p>

<p>River networks</p>

<p>Fault lines</p>

<p>Mountain ranges</p>

<p>Craters</p>

<p>Lightning bolts</p>

<p>Coastlines</p>

<p>Mountain goat horns</p>

<p>Trees</p>

<p>Algae</p>

<p>Geometrical optics</p>

<p>Animal coloration patterns</p>

<p>Romanesco broccoli</p>

<p>Pineapple</p>

<p>Heart rates</p>

<p>Heart sounds</p>

<p>Earthquakes</p>

<p>Snowflakes</p>

<p>Psychological subjective perception</p>

<p>Crystals</p>

<p>Blood vessels and pulmonary vessels</p>

<p>Ocean waves</p>

<p>DNA</p>

<p>Soil pores</p>

<p>Rings of Saturn</p>

<p>Proteins</p>

<p>Surfaces in turbulent flows</p>

<p>Modeled fractals may be sounds, digital images, electrochemical patterns, circadian rhythms, etc. Fractal patterns have been reconstructed in physical 3-dimensional space and virtually, often called &quot;in silico&quot; modeling. Models of fractals are generally created using fractal-generating software that implements techniques such as those outlined above. As one illustration, trees, ferns, cells of the nervous system, blood and lung vasculature, and other branching patterns in nature can be modeled on a computer by using recursive algorithms and L-systems techniques. The recursive nature of some patterns is obvious in certain examples—a branch from a tree or a frond from a fern is a miniature replica of the whole: not identical, but similar in nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I didn&#39;t meant it like that. I wanted to write natural desasters first but revised to events because it doesn&#39;t need to be a disaster per se. Regular natural processes like erosion or continental drift are reasons for separation as well but not disasters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think disasters do have e very big impact to the equation. A simple example is the end of the dinosaurs which happened due to a range of events, most famous of them was the asteroid impact but also a growing volcanic activity if i am not totally mistaken. This led to them dying out making room for our ancestors to evolve as they did. There have been many of these extinction events in earths history and all of them shaped life how it is today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes this is evolution. Splitting into subspecies is evolution too.</p>

<p>And losing features is part of evolution too. Isn&#39;t a whale losing his legs for fins evolution?</p>

<p>Again evolution is neither directed to a goal nor does it have to become more complex. Natural selection might lead to losing a feature of a species if it helps survivability.</p>

<p>The only thing evolution describes is the process of adaption of a species to external pressure by natural selection.</p>

<p>Evolution doesn&#39;t care if legs are lost or gained, it doesn&#39;t care for flying or swimming as long as the next generation is more adapt at surviving then that last. </p>

<p>No a whales didn&#39;t have legs and grew fins. It was a gradual process for many generations that lead to a transfer from legs to fins through multiple species. That&#39;s why you find bones similar to our fingers and feet in today&#39;s whale&#39;s fins. Because whales are mammals like humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well why is there a human, then an a bunch of ape species, then smaller monkey species? Why does man differ so much? Apes are fractals of man, and monkeys are fractals of apes. Why is an ape an ape, and a man a man? Do we really have a scientific explanation for that? We are the more intelligent species. They are fractals of us. Why? Simply because we exist. Cause, and react effect. Does evolution really explain our difference between them? Not at all. They are just a lower species that exists from our existence. </p>

<p>Humans and Apes evolved from a common ancestor and share certain traits.</p>

<p>Yes we have a scientific explenation why we are different. Humans and ie chimpanzees share a similar DNA setup that we inherited from a common ancestor. And the difference in DNA results in a difference in Phenotype.</p>

You believe in evolution in a physical world, but man doesn&#39;t evolve through the physical world just his massive intelligence. That doesn&#39;t make sense. Why is man so ill equipped to handle the world, and rely  on his brain? We went from playing with sticks to flying machines. You name any other animal on earth that can compare.That is not evolution. Man didn&#39;t develop fur, but he killed animals and working them like fur. Why? If evolution is true we would of developed physical traits, and characteristics . We didn&#39;t. Our ancestors were &quot;evolved&quot; from were actually  more equipped to handle the earth. Man is not an animal, but has similarities to an animal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re mistaking evolution with the idea that it&#39;s continuous &#39;improvement&#39; on the earlier versions. </p>

<p>Evolution is simply the result of small changes in genetic make up over time. First changes are unexpected mutations of genes, which in most cases don&#39;t pose an advantage over non mutated versions. However, if the mutation was say in a colour pigment gene and that mutation was a colour provided better camouflage, then there is better chance of that mutation being passed on to offspring. Another example could be longer legs that aid in speed and agility to avoid a predator. With every &#39;Predator vs Prey&#39; relationship in nature, you can see these evolutionary &#39;arms races&#39; in action.</p>

<p>If you are actually concerned about keeping an open mind and questioning everything, read some material on the subject. The Richard Dawkins book &quot;Greatest Show on Earth&quot; goes into great detail on evolution and how it works. It very much helped me understand the concept more clearly.</p>

<p>If you are viewing this from a religious point of view where you think that by accepting the fact of evolution it disproves the existence of god, that doesn&#39;t have to be the case. Instead you could view it as God equipped DNA with the ability to mutate and result in gradual changes over time, in order to let the universe constantly change and adapt in order to not require micromanaging. Just like he used fractals for creating crystals, horns, leaves or whatever your post is trying to say.</p>

Man is not an animal, but has similarities to an animal.Surely, you don&#39;t believe all the great , vast different forms of Life on earth all share the same ancestor of some floating comb jelly. That is absurd.</p>

<p>The way science states that dinosaurs split into crocodiles, lizards, birds, snakes, etc. This isn&#39;t a process of evolving. These animals are similar , because they share a common bond from their original fractals. This is why you can&#39;t explain all animals traits as evolution from survival, or reproduction, but you can compare the animals from common ancestors, and where the fractals occurred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m wasting my time with you but I&#39;ll try again.</p>

<p>Man does evolve through the physical world. Our lack of full body hair (ability to sweat all over for cooling) and our upright posture and long powerful legs that evolved after thousands of different generations of humanoid type ancestors, makes us the best undisputed long distance runners on this planet. Out ability to out run and out last our prey and using our intelligence to work together with each other, is what put us on top. Any other remaining humanoid type ape couldn&#39;t compete with us for food, or we just killed them for any number of reasons. The reason no other land animal comes close to our intelligence is that we have killed off all direct competition. </p>

<p>Man is extremely well equipped to handle the world, thanks to:
- upright posture allowing a farther field of view to survey the terrain.
- good eyesight to spot threats / food in the distance.
- powerful legs for running long distances
- hairless, sweat gland covered body to help cool during long distance pursuits
- Intelligence that allows problem solving, teamwork, and use of tools to solve problems that can&#39;t be solved by body alone.
- dextrous hands to work with the tools we have created.</p>

<p>You are fixated on fractals to a fault of not seeing the direct evidence before you.</p>

<p>If you are unwilling to accept the truth of evolution and won&#39;t even bother reading well written books on the subject that explain it in such a way that anyone can understand, then enjoy having your opinions cast aside as the ramblings of a fool, because that&#39;s what they are.</p>

Whale-manatee- sea lion- otter, etc., or dinosaur- crocodiles -lizards-birds-snakes,etc. or even human-ape-monkey</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How whales accomplished such an enormous transformation has baffled even the greatest scientific intellects. Recognizing the conundrum as one of the great challenges to his theory of evolution by natural selection, Charles Darwin took a stab at accounting for whales in the first edition of Origin of Species. He noted that black bears had been seen swimming with their mouths open for hours at a time on the surface of a lake, feeding on floating insects. &quot;I can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered, by natural selection, more and more aquatic in their structure and habits, with larger and larger mouths,&quot; Darwin concluded, &quot;till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale.&quot; His critics poked such loud and gleeful fun at this image, however, that he eventually omitted it from later editions of his book.</p>

<p>Nearly a century later George Gaylord Simpson, the preeminent paleontologist of the 20th century, was still at a loss to explain where whales fit in his otherwise orderly evolutionary tree of mammals. &quot;The cetaceans are on the whole the most peculiar and aberrant of mammals,&quot; he remarked peevishly. &quot;There is no proper place for them in a scala naturae. They may be imagined as extending into a different dimension from any of the surrounding orders or cohorts.&quot;</p>

<p>If science could not account for the transformation of whales, antievolutionists argued, perhaps it never happened. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t explain anything. You just say oh a lot of time passed. Yeah that&#39;s the answer for everything. Regardless of time. Why evolve and animal evolve in a sense backward.  You can&#39;t account for the traits, and characteristics being for survival, reproduction, mutation, etc. It doesn&#39;t make sense. If you think you can just spout out propaganda from a book and you proved your case I assure you the propaganda doesn&#39;t work on me. </p>

<p>Key Points:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For more than a century, our knowledge of the whale fossil record was so sparse that no one could be certain what the ancestors of whales looked like. Now the tide has turned. In the space of just three decades, a flood of new fossils has filled in the gaps in our knowledge to turn the origin of whales into one of the best-documented examples of large-scale evolutionary change in the fossil record. These ancestral creatures were stranger than anyone ever expected. There was no straight-line march of terrestrial mammals leading up to fully aquatic whales, but an evolutionary riot of amphibious cetaceans that walked and swam along rivers, estuaries and the coasts of prehistoric Asia. As strange as modern whales are, their fossil predecessors were even stranger.</p>

<p>(Regarding the Bears swimming quote) Darwin was widely ridiculed for this passage. Critics took it to mean he was proposing that bears were direct ancestors of whales. Darwin had done no such thing, but the jeering caused him to modify the passage in subsequent editions of the book. But while preparing the sixth edition, he decided to include a small note about Basilosaurus. Writing to his staunch advocate T.H. Huxley in 1871, Darwin asked whether the ancient whale might represent a transitional form. Huxley replied that there could be little doubt that Basilosaurus provided clues as to the ancestry of whales.</p>

<p>While analyzing the relationships of ancient meat-eating mammals in 1966, however, the evolutionary biologist Leigh Van Valen was struck by the similarities between an extinct group of land-dwelling carnivores called mesonychids and the earliest known whales. Often called “wolves with hooves,” mesonychids were medium- to large-sized predators with long, toothy snouts and toes tipped with hooves rather than sharp claws. They were major predators in the Northern Hemisphere from shortly after the demise of the dinosaurs until about 30 million years ago, and the shape of their teeth resembled those of whales like Protocetus. Van Valen hypothesized that some mesonychids may have been marsh dwellers, “mollusk eaters that caught an occasional fish, the broadened phalanges [finger and toe bones] aiding them on damp surfaces.” A population of mesonychids in a marshy habitat might have been enticed into the water by seafood. Once they had begun swimming for their supper, succeeding generations would become more and more aquatically adapted until something “as monstrous as a whale” evolved.</p>

<p>I expect you&#39;ll dismiss that article as Propaganda though, so good luck in your future endeavors. I don&#39;t think I can say anything or provide any trusted source or material to change your opinion at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have already pointed out the extreme story-telling that occurred with Pakicetus, involving Dr Philip Gingerich.3 An incomplete skull fossil was imagined to be that of a whale-like creature, displayed  as an artist’s impression on the cover of the prestigious journal, Science, in 1983. Some years   later the rest of Pakicetus was found, published in 2001, and it proved to be nothing like a whale. Contrary    to what Dr Gingerich had imagined, there was no blowhole, there were no flippers (only hooves), and there was no whale neck (just a neck typical for land mammals). Even so, Dr Werner reveals that the American Museum of Natural History in New York  and the Natural History Museum in London have not stopped using the falsely-reconstructed skull that shows a blowhole </p>

<p>In a National Geographic documentary in 2009, Dr Gingerich still claimed that Pakicetus should be classed   with whales, based on its ear-bone. However, the ear-bone is not like a whale, which has a finger-like projection (sigmoid  process), but is plate-like, like the fossils of land animals known as artiodactyls.</p>

<p>Ambulocetus
 A painting of Ambulocetus at the Smithsonian, showing fake blowhole and tiny ears. There is no fossil  evidence for either claimed whale-like feature.
Ambulocetus</p>

<p>ambulo-check-bone
 Comparison of the cheek bones of a cetacean (a dolphin, which is in the whale family), Ambulocetus, and    a horse. Dr Thewissen claimed that the cheek-bone of Ambulocetus is thin and whale-like, but this is not the case   at all.
The ‘walking whale’ is portrayed as an intermediate between Pakicetus and Rodhocetus. Dr Hans   Thewissen, former student of Dr Gingerich, said that there were eight characteristics that showed that Ambulocetus  was a whale ancestor. We have also reported on Ambulocetus  but Dr Werner   recorded on video Dr Thewissen admitting that a key evidence of whale ancestry, the sigmoid process of the ear-bone apparatus   (again), was actually nothing like a whale ear bone. Also, the cheek bone, which Thewissen claimed is thin like a whale cheek bone, is actually not thin at all; a horse, for example, has a much thinner cheekbone than Ambulocetus .</p>

<p>Dr Werner says, ‘All eight characters he reported as whale features are disturbingly non-whale features.’
Furthermore, Dr Thewissen’s lab has supplied models of Ambulocetus to various museums that show a blowhole    in the snout of the skull, but there is no fossil evidence of a blowhole. Dr Werner says, “All eight characters he    reported as whale features are disturbingly non-whale features.”</p>

<p>Rodhocetus</p>

<p>Rodhocetus was claimed to be an aquatic animal that was developing front flippers and a whale-like tail with flukes (horizontal fins)—i.e.    supposedly well on the way to becoming a whale. However, when Dr Werner pointed out to the paleontologist who discovered    Rodhocetus, Dr Gingerich, that there was no fossil skeletal evidence for a tail or flippers, Dr Gingerich admitted  that this was so. He also admitted that he now thought that the creature had neither of these critical  whale features. We provided some of this information in Creation magazine in 2011.  However, the tail and flippers are still displayed in many articles, and I expect that, like Haeckel’s artistic embryos, will be for many years to come.</p>

<p>Without these three supposed transitional creatures, the story of whale evolution collapses. Another evolutionary icon bite the dust!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>according to whale expert Philip Gingerich, the “Hind limbs of Basilosaurus are most plausibly interpreted as accessories facilitating reproduction. … used as guides during copulation which may otherwise have been difficult in a serpentine aquatic animal.”  (Science vol. 249, pp154-157, 13 July 1990)</p>

<p>Living whales have also been claimed to have vestigial legs as they have small bones in their pelvic region. However, we know these have a function in supporting and stabilising the pelvic organs.</p>

<p>What can we conclude from the fossil evidence?</p>

<p>There is no evidence that any of the above fossil creatures, or any others in the textbook whale evolutionary tree, ever turned into a whale. Simply arranging fossils according to the number of land or water dwelling features it has, does not prove one evolved into the next in a diagrammatic sequence.  There is no more reason to believe that extinct semi-aquatic creatures evolved into whales any more than we should believe than living semi-aquatic creatures are evolving into whales now.  The fact that they are extinct does not mean they evolved into anything else.  It simply means they are dead and buried, which is a good reminder that the fossils do not show the history of life on earth, but only the record of death on the planet.</p>

<p>You believe in evolution in a physical world, but man doesn&#39;t evolve through the physical world just his massive intelligence. That doesn&#39;t make sense.

    <div class="md"><p>The way science states that dinosaurs split into crocodiles, lizards, birds, snakes, etc. This isn&#39;t a process of evolving. These animals are similar , because they share a common bond from their original fractals. This is why you can&#39;t explain all animals traits as evolution from survival, or reproduction, but you can compare the animals from common ancestors, and where the fractals occurred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An incomplete skull fossil was imagined to be that of a whale-like creature, displayed as an artist’s impression on the cover of the prestigious journal, Science, in 1983. Some years later the rest of Pakicetus was found, published in 2001, and it proved to be nothing like a whale. Contrary to what Dr Gingerich had imagined, there was no blowhole, there were no flippers (only hooves), and there was no whale neck (just a neck typical for land mammals). Even so, Dr Werner reveals that the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Natural History Museum in London have not stopped using the falsely-reconstructed skull that shows a blowhole
In a National Geographic documentary in 2009, Dr Gingerich still claimed that Pakicetus should be classed with whales, based on its ear-bone. However, the ear-bone is not like a whale, which has a finger-like projection (sigmoid process), but is plate-like, like the fossils of land animals known as artiodactyls.
Ambulocetus A painting of Ambulocetus at the Smithsonian, showing fake blowhole and tiny ears. There is no fossil evidence for either claimed whale-like feature. Ambulocetus
ambulo-check-bone Comparison of the cheek bones of a cetacean (a dolphin, which is in the whale family), Ambulocetus, and a horse. Dr Thewissen claimed that the cheek-bone of Ambulocetus is thin and whale-like, but this is not the case at all. The ‘walking whale’ is portrayed as an intermediate between Pakicetus and Rodhocetus. Dr Hans Thewissen, former student of Dr Gingerich, said that there were eight characteristics that showed that Ambulocetus was a whale ancestor. We have also reported on Ambulocetus but Dr Werner recorded on video Dr Thewissen admitting that a key evidence of whale ancestry, the sigmoid process of the ear-bone apparatus (again), was actually nothing like a whale ear bone. Also, the cheek bone, which Thewissen claimed is thin like a whale cheek bone, is actually not thin at all; a horse, for example, has a much thinner cheekbone than Ambulocetus .
Dr Werner says, ‘All eight characters he reported as whale features are disturbingly non-whale features.’ Furthermore, Dr Thewissen’s lab has supplied models of Ambulocetus to various museums that show a blowhole in the snout of the skull, but there is no fossil evidence of a blowhole. Dr Werner says, “All eight characters he reported as whale features are disturbingly non-whale features.”
Rodhocetus
Rodhocetus was claimed to be an aquatic animal that was developing front flippers and a whale-like tail with flukes (horizontal fins)—i.e. supposedly well on the way to becoming a whale. However, when Dr Werner pointed out to the paleontologist who discovered Rodhocetus, Dr Gingerich, that there was no fossil skeletal evidence for a tail or flippers, Dr Gingerich admitted that this was so. He also admitted that he now thought that the creature had neither of these critical whale features. We provided some of this information in Creation magazine in 2011. However, the tail and flippers are still displayed in many articles, and I expect that, like Haeckel’s artistic embryos, will be for many years to come.
Without these three supposed transitional creatures, the story of whale evolution collapses. Another evolutionary icon bite the dust!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>according to whale expert Philip Gingerich, the “Hind limbs of Basilosaurus are most plausibly interpreted as accessories facilitating reproduction. … used as guides during copulation which may otherwise have been difficult in a serpentine aquatic animal.” (Science vol. 249, pp154-157, 13 July 1990)
Living whales have also been claimed to have vestigial legs as they have small bones in their pelvic region. However, we know these have a function in supporting and stabilising the pelvic organs.
What can we conclude from the fossil evidence?
There is no evidence that any of the above fossil creatures, or any others in the textbook whale evolutionary tree, ever turned into a whale. Simply arranging fossils according to the number of land or water dwelling features it has, does not prove one evolved into the next in a diagrammatic sequence. There is no more reason to believe that extinct semi-aquatic creatures evolved into whales any more than we should believe than living semi-aquatic creatures are evolving into whales now. The fact that they are extinct does not mean they evolved into anything else. It simply means they are dead and buried, which is a good reminder that the fossils do not show the history of life on earth, but only the record of death on the planet.</p>
