    <div class="md"><p>It means there is a metabolic issue occurring from the infectious process of the Borrelia spirochetal infection, the spirochetes (spirochetes are spiral prokaryotes that contain longer and more flexible cells which cause Lyme disease and syphilis.) are proof of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, thanks for the information - a new one to me.</p>

<p>I am in IT mainly, so I don&#39;t really feel qualified to comment on a disease :) (though I do get periodicals from the CDC, but that is another issue).</p>

<p>Are you seeing a coverup of certain things regarding this?</p>

<p>that all said, and looking at your reply, I will say this (off the cuff):</p>

<p>There are problems in our medical discussions (whether via media or otherwise) that highlight the problems with acceptance of those in the profession with certain things (like ignoring data, personal anecdotes, etc and so on).</p>

<p>Is it your contention that this particular issue has been ignored, or glossed over, etc?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your hitting the head on all of it.</p>

<p>Morgellons started out as the &quot;psycho disorder&quot;, only people who we considered crazy had it (Doesn&#39;t it sound odd that syphilis apparently makes you lose your mind and it is also a spirochetal infection?), and most western nation doctors considered it a joke, with it being ignored 100%. </p>

<p>In other countries, like Asian Countries and Europe, they didn&#39;t fuck around, they provided these people with psychological support because they knew something was going on, like 90% of morgellon sufferers are hospitalized in a psych ward, this number is too high and in itself proves that there is something else occurring. </p>

<p>It is now taboo to discuss in western nations as its considered the &quot;boogyman&quot; of diseases, when it should be seen as a chance to advance our understanding of what our enviroment/diets/lives are doing to us.</p>

<p>Basically, was the &quot;cry wolf&quot; disease, seems to be real, people are afraid to get involved because it was the &quot;fake&quot; disease. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, now that is good stuff :)</p>

<p>This all harkens back to Thomas Szasz and his theories on Psychiatry ( <a href="http://www.szasz.com/">http://www.szasz.com/</a> ) and no, I don&#39;t agree with everything he says :)</p>

<p>Anyway, the idea is that those in power get decide who is crazy, based on their own ideals of what is normal and not. I think that plays into what you are getting to with this.</p>

<p>And that, in a roundabout way, gets into conspiracies :) Especially here in the US (as you noted, this was treated differently elsewhere - different power structure, different results).</p>

<p>This, IMHO, boils down into prejudice and social structure (defined by those in power and what they see as worthy vs not worthy and so on).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have enough information on this topic to really get into it all but will check it out more in the coming months (got a lot going on starting in a few days so will be busy).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got it though, you understand. </p>

<p>Its basically that it was not a normal condition that medical professionals learn about, or many patients with these conditions. </p>

<p>Coincidentally, most people who have this psychiatric breakdown caused by morgellons is understandable from the point of view of an illness sufferer being ignored, and also gives a tip-of-the-hat to Syphilis, which coincidentally does the same thing, which is coincidentally also a spirochetal infection, and the Borrelia spirochetes suggest lyme disease.</p>

<p>If you want my theory: Lyme disease is one of the infections caused by Borrelia spirochetes, but there is likely another metabolic route that the presence of spirochetes activated keratinocytes and fibroblasts to express keratin and collagen take that causes Morgellons. But who knows. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And that is my problem with some professions.</p>

<p>Led by a few that ignore the many over biases. I don&#39;t know how many times I have been to a doctor myself where they have ignored things I told them and insisted that I was &#39;off my rocker&#39;. Only to find out later, through blood tests/etc that I knew what I was talking about.</p>

<p>To look at this more in depth, think about it like this:</p>

<p>You get accused of a crime. If you have a good attorney (you are wealthy) you can get a better defense and people to listen to you and hear your side.</p>

<p>Now imagine you are poor and go to a doctor and tell them what you know. They just chalk it up to xyz when you know your body and researched things and feel it is abc. If you have a lot of money and see a doctor they will get you more tests, more specialists and listen to you more.</p>

<p>The medical field, law, politics, are all the same in this regards - the few will tell the many one thing while listening in a different way to the wealthy. And that goes back to your topic and how it is handled (as it did with agent orange, aids, etc).</p>

<p>Always question, always keep fighting - because if history shows us anything it is that those with power and money ignore a great deal of things. To the detriment of us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the best way to explain it. I wasn’t buying it reading the medical terms for it.  After reading this it makes total sense and I agree with you.</p>

<p>Some people are apprehensive because it is easy to trick people by using a lot of long buzz words and sounding smart. But in this case you actually know what you are talking about, and understand it so well that you assume that we all understand what the terminology all means (I find myself doing this often)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I need to say something I have previously already stated, I did not believe Morgellons was real either. I submitted a response to a thread in regards to various bacterial/viral infections and he was asking about it, I remember reading up about it in the past but there was NOTHING conclusive and I did not have access to the peer reviewed papers I have now. </p>

<p>When I started reading I found things that connected. </p>

<p>If you go to when I first started these threads, everything is in roughly 3-10 peer reviewed articles, and using these articles, I was able to construct what exactly the virus is, and what it <strong>SEEMS</strong> to be doing. </p>

<p>Its not fully understand at all, and in regards to the type of infection it is, it should have further stages, but this raises another question, is it already in a further stage once collagen and keratin begin being produced in the epidermis? Who knows, we don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>Its a spirochetal infection of sometype, that creates Spirochetes just like Lyme disease, causes the mental breakdown of someone with Syphilis, (coincidental that they are all spirochetal infections). It has nothing to do with additives, diets, carcinogens, etc, it has to do with a viral spirochetal infection that doesn&#39;t work the way normal spirochetal infections that we know of work. </p>

<p>This is where I stood up until literally today, I presented all the peer reviewed articles, or you can go to my comments/posts and see for yourself, but I will give you a TL;DR of this:</p>

<p>&quot;Morgellons Disease seems to be caused by a spirochetal infection, and the filaments detected in the cases were found to have a collagen component, and contain melanin pigment, suggesting that the presence of spirochetes activated keratinocytes and fibroblasts to express keratin and collagen.</p>

<p>Morgellons Disease is a true somatic illness associated with Borrelia spirochetes that cause Lyme disease.</p>

<p>&quot;imaging from representative Morgellons disease samples revealing that dermal filaments in these cases are keratin and collagen in composition and result from proliferation and activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the epidermis. Spirochetes were detected in the dermatological specimens from our study patients, providing evidence that Morgellons disease is associated with an infectious process.&quot;&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically, everyone thought the disease was made up, but it turns out that a certain type of bacteria (spyrochete) stimulates skin cells to produce more keratin and collagen, making the host itchy and uncomfortable?</p>

<p>I had never really heard of this disease until now. I saw you mentioned something about Lyme disease and it being man-made, and that maybe Morgellon&#39;s disease is as well?</p>

<p>Would you mind expanding a little on all of this? I&#39;m interested but mostly ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. It was considered a fake psychosis disease for the last like 10 years. </p>

<p>Just read this and I will expand:</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Morgellons Disease seems to be caused by a spirochetal infection, and the filaments detected in the cases were found to have a collagen component, and contain melanin pigment, suggesting that the presence of spirochetes activated keratinocytes and fibroblasts to express keratin and collagen.</p>

<p>Morgellons Disease is a true somatic illness associated with Borrelia spirochetes that cause Lyme disease.</p>

<p>&quot;imaging from representative Morgellons disease samples revealing that dermal filaments in these cases are keratin and collagen in composition and result from proliferation and activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the epidermis. Spirochetes were detected in the dermatological specimens from our study patients, providing evidence that Morgellons disease is associated with an infectious process.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Clarity</strong>: spirochetal infections are like Lyme disease, syphilis, yaws, etc, lyme disease creates Spirochetes (Borrelia burgdorferi is what is important here, and its the only causative agent for Lyme disease in the United States.), the presence of these Borrelia spirochetes indicate a spirochetal infection, the mental breakdown caused by Morgellons seems to be consistent with Syphilis, and the physical feeling of fatigue seems to also be consistent with Lyme disease, but Borellia spirochetes being present in the skin/epidermic seems to cause the activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. </p>

<p>The Dermal filaments are real, they may not be threads like some people have stated, but it is technically filaments of keratin and collagen. I still can&#39;t find any information how the spirochetes being present cause activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, but it likely has to do with chemicals the virus is spewing out or something. </p>

<p>Basically, its a true condition, we now know this, but there are still lots of questions, and before we can figure that out, it can no longer be taboo to speak about Morgellons. This is also something good. </p>

<p>Knowing its a spirochetal infection, with spirochetes being present, we know things about to, so if someone was to claim to have it, one day we should be able to simply prove that there is either spirochetes present/or a spirochetal infection, or if there are the normally characterized filaments, or if there is proof of excess activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts (the filaments would be enough proof of this though). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder why the Borrelia don&#39;t get to the nervous system and cause Lyme disease in cases of Morgellons. Maybe it needs to enter the bloodstream? But if its in the skin, you&#39;d think it would eventually get into the bloodstream one way or another.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve never heard the theory that this bacteria was man-made. Do you believe that to be the case?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, was likely created alongside lyme, or is lyme disease expressing itself differently, or the body quarantines it and tricks it into thinking its infecting cells when its really just causing collagen and keratin production in the epidermis. </p>

<p>It really doesn&#39;t matter if it was created at this point though, its here, thats all that matters, we need to find out the vector, where is the largest cluster of infections occurring? We need to be able to diagnose, are filaments present proving spirochetes are causing activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts? Are Spirochetes pressent? What is the reason these Spirochetes are activating keratinocytes and fibroblasts instead of traveling to the heart, bones and the nervous system? </p>

<p>Worrying about how something was made means nothing, it gives us no control over the situation. </p>

<p>I am a huge science geek who always wanted to become a virologist and then go into epidemiology and work for something like the CDC, instead I got fucked over trying to go to school and sued for my student loans and now I am poor af, I am living off of 400$ for this month, and I am sitting here, just figuring out Morgellons while million dollar companies ignore it as a &quot;psychotic condition&quot;. </p>

<p>TL;DR: Morgellons Disease seems to be caused by a spirochetal infection, and the filaments detected in the cases were found to have a collagen component, and contain melanin pigment, suggesting that the presence of spirochetes activated keratinocytes and fibroblasts to express keratin and collagen.</p>

<p>Morgellons Disease is a true somatic illness associated with Borrelia spirochetes that cause Lyme disease.</p>

<p>&quot;imaging from representative Morgellons disease samples revealing that dermal filaments in these cases are keratin and collagen in composition and result from proliferation and activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the epidermis. Spirochetes were detected in the dermatological specimens from our study patients, providing evidence that Morgellons disease is associated with an infectious process.&quot;</p>

<p>I present all this information based upon peer reviewed articles, and the identification of keratin and collagen literally has pictures provided within the peer reviewed article.</p>

<p>Its a spirochetal infection of sometype, that creates Spirochetes just like Lyme disease, causes the mental breakdown of someone with Syphilis, (coincidental that they are all spirochetal infections). It has nothing to do with additives, diets, carcinogens, etc, it has to do with a viral spirochetal infection that doesn&#39;t work the way normal spirochetal infections that we know of work.</p>

<p>If you really care, go get your wife checked for Borrelia spirochetes, and then get a biopsy that searched for keratin and collagen specifically. If both are found to be present with the epidermis, then there is a likely chance she has Morgellons, a spirochetal infection. </p>

<p>The thing that catches me about what you have said is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He did this in front of me and proceeded to pull a fiber approximately one half inch long out of the cut he made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of them are between 1-15 microns, to find one that is a half inch means it is progressing as spirochetal infections do, like Lyme, Yaws, Syphilis, these all have 2 or more stages. Morgellons disease isn&#39;t fully understood or even properly discussed. </p>

<p>If you want my opinion, with everything I present, it seems we have found the mid point, when the Borrelia spirochetes actually starts causing the keratinocytes and fibroblasts to overproduce keratin and collagen filaments in the epidermis. We don&#39;t know why the Borrelia spirochetes are there, its commonly associated with Lyme disease and is the only known causative agent of it in the United States. Why is the present of Borrelia even causing the keratinocytes and fibroblasts to produce keratin and collagen in the epidermis? If someone is able to pull out a half inch strand, that means it has likely progressed seriously enough for them to identify the filament location and physically remove it. </p>

<p>I am not a professional (I wish I was, I could be if I had the opportunity), but this is a crucial time in our understanding of morgellons, if we write this disease off as &quot;phony&quot; when there is clear evidence of its existence in multiple peer reviewed papers, then we are literally preventing furthering our understanding of biology. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t lie, there is probably a scientist who specializes in spirochetal infections that will get totally excited by this. </p>
