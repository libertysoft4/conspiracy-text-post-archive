<p>Even if you believe that Russia did not hack the elections, the uproar is deafening, to the point where it is surprising the elections haven&#39;t been thrown out. This lucky &quot;hit&quot; would be easy with such a large amount of computational power. Assuming it was found out, why couldn&#39;t they just place the news covering it in boxes, (dead ends in websites), block the news of it, (snip reruns of older, (though not outdated), news segments on top), then ignore it? It would be easy to just keep it secret, anyway, as the boxes are not checked enough to matter- until it is too late.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve had a few successes with DDoS attacks, but I believe you&#39;re completely overestimating Anonymous if you think they can not only hack a US election but also somehow get away with it. I can maybe see an Anonymous-backed candidate doing decently in an election if most of Anonymous unified behind a candidate with an widespread campaign and a commitment to vote for said candidate, but that&#39;s about it.</p>

After all, there is even a convention to hack into voting booths, and it is extremely easy for anyone with any form of hacking power. Someone with the power to attack heavily secured financial institutions should quite easily be able to take some voting booths, (which are, again, extremely easy to hack).</p>

<p>DDoS requires a significant amount of computational power. Even distributed hacks, (such as with the 1000+ fold increase in power from the Windows time log function- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcDZS7iYNsA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcDZS7iYNsA</a> ). If they can DDoS anyone of relative significance, (PSN much?), then they can hack a voting booth.</p>
