A few grown adults I personally know have developed pneumonia afterwards and are still battling it (which is abnormal for them). </p>

<p>To top it off,  I may or may not work on the phones all day calling all around the nation for sales.  Anyways I&#39;ve had several places I call have to reschedule appointments with me bc too many people are out with the flu. I get that it&#39;s flu season height.  But this seems quite aggressive....  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is that naproxen doesn&#39;t work well as an antiviral anymore. Antivirals are like antibiotics, except viruses seem to build resistance even faster than bacteria.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall the drug, but an effective avian flu antiviral was being used ubiquitously in China for chicken populations. It&#39;s now worthless.</p>

<p>Americans will be quick to hear that and think, &quot;damn Chinese, saving some money while screwing up our medicine.&quot; But in the US we&#39;re giving cattle and other livestock a diet of antibiotics for the same goal (short term money), it&#39;s just taking longer for the consequences to catch up with us, which is honestly terrifying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;According to new estimates published today, between <strong>291,000 and 646,000 people worldwide</strong> die from seasonal influenza-related respiratory illnesses each year, higher than a previous estimate of 250,000 to 500,000 and based on a robust, multinational survey. The new estimate, from a collaborative study by CDC and global health partners, appears today in The Lancet. The estimate excludes deaths during pandemics.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The overall hospitalization rate is high also, but still lower than the overall hospitalization rate reported during the same week of the 2014-2015 season....This translates to a cumulative overall rate of 22.7 hospitalizations per 100,000 people in the United States....During 2014-2015, hospitalization rates reported during week 1 for all ages were 29.9 per 100,00&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>UK here, my sister had this same very strong flu over xmas. I myself caught it and it floored me from New Year&#39;s Eve til January 3rd. It takes a very strong strain to get me, and when it does it hits hard.
Sister developed pneumonia and now my partner is just starting to recover from the flu she got from me.
My folks also caught it from my sis and are still recovering too. 
We are a very healthy family, and this strain has totally floored us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same story in my family too. It usually expect to get some flu around this time of year, but most any flu I get passes in 2-3 days if I get a lot of rest, drink lots of water, and have a high fruit and berry diet. Same again this year on my part, but what was new was my dad getting the flu. He&#39;s got an immune system like a fucking champion so for him to get the flu was really something. But again, passed in 2-3 days. My brother got floored by it though. He couldn&#39;t visit over Christmas as he was out the whole week with it where he lives. Definitely noticeably different haha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point. I usually assume that flu is when I have the cold symptoms, but when they&#39;re more extreme like with really drastic temperature changes (overheating then cold sweats), and also being sick. I don&#39;t feel nauseous with a cold, but on the occasions I think I have the flu it&#39;s the nausea that seemingly confirms it. The main symptoms are usually over in 2-3 days though, but I will spend the rest of the week coughing: partly to get the remaining shit out my lungs, and partly because all the coughing roughs up my throat, making me cough more. But yeah, I think whatever my brother got must have been the legit hard-hitting flu that had been going round at that time.</p>

<p>Last year, my sister had it and developed pneumonia afterward (which was abnormal for her).</p>

<p>Both are over 50 years old.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, and I was just wondering. I have a theory, and suffer from chronic bronchitis (or w/e it&#39;s called - had it since a baby). I&#39;ve been hit, but, obviously... I&#39;m not around many people, these days, so it&#39;s not so bad. Was just curious. I used to get hit hard when I lived in &quot;civilization&quot;.</p>

<p>Glad to hear y&#39;all recovered well. Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The flu shot is a gamble every year. CDC openly discusses the process. It entails looking at flu trends in the southern hemisphere during their flu season (among other data) and trying to foresee which strains are likely to be a problem six months later in the north. Then come up with an inoculation and then produce and distribute it to millions within a couple of months. Every year, strains get through, but the big one this year has obviously been worse than usual.
Also, most of the time you say you have the flu but you don&#39;t. Categorically, you are more likely to have a respiratory or digestive tract virus; a true influenza will put you down and nearly kill you, not just make you miserable.</p>

<p>For anyone worried about this.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>, one of only 4 people to have ever been awarded 2 Nobel prizes (his scientific Nobel is in chemistry), spent a large part of his life studying <strong>the effects of Vitamin C</strong>, what he calls “megavitamin” therapy, and its near-miraculous healing power. </p>

<p>See his 2004 book, <em>Healing Cancer: Complementary Vitamin &amp; Drug Treatments</em>, or his 1987 book <em>How to Live Longer and Feel Better</em> in particular.</p>

<p>Per this particular thread, I can also mention his 1977 book <em>Vitamin C, the Common Cold and the Flu</em>.</p>

<p>And again, realize who this man is. </p>

<p>Look also into liposomal vitamin C (a way to increase one’s intake of the nutrient). </p>

<p>This is probably one of the biggest medical discoveries of our time. The reason nobody speaks about it (and indeed the reason it is suppressed) is because ascorbic acid cannot be patented and is extremely easy &amp; cheap to produce. </p>

I used to have a really weak immune system, I was constantly sick. I have kids so they come home from school germ factories and parks etc and would constantly have something. I  began to take lipo vitamin c regularly. Since I started taking it I rarely get sick, if I do manage to pick something up it will be short and brief. This time around I was knocked on my ass and seemingly nothing helped. Although I did and still am taking it everyday and am finally on the mend! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. Thank you for sharing your experience. For what it’s worth, I think you are telling the truth, and that you’re legit, even though you rarely post in this sub. I read and found interesting your post about miscarriages (what’s your personal conclusion/theory on this?).</p>

<p>I’m also glad vitamin C helps you. Happy new year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more of a reader. I found this sub about 6 months ago and it quickly became my go to. I just get anxiety when I post. </p>

<p>I need to go back and go over that. Shortly after that post I got sick and everything has kind of been on the back burner as I was out of it and pretty much asleep for 10 days. </p>

<p>A huge number of people in the area have been sick with this similar bronchial flu cold. It is making me really lean towards the thought that there is an environmental factor in all of this. Possibly something in the water, soil from construction projects, something that we are breathing in, or even in the ocean. I also believe I&#39;m most likely fighting an autoimmune issue which we have yet to pin point. I need to take time and let my body recover and heal and do my best to get healthy (and maintain it!) and bunker down and try and figure out serious possibilities and if there truly is a reason. I don&#39;t want that pain inflicted on anyone else and it&#39;s heartbreaking so many were and are (most likely, silently) going through it. </p>

<p>Thank you and happy new year to you!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Can you kindly expand on that?</p>

<p>Also I understand the chirality is important; in food it will be of the right chirality, in cheap synthetic Vitamin C it will be 50/50. But in quality synthetic Vitamin C it will be near-100% right chirality.</p>

<p>Is there another difference between natural vs synthetic Vitamin C I’m not aware of?</p>

<p>Also Pauling iirc advocated for intravenous megavitamin therapy in case of illness (e.g. cancer). So in that case it would <em>have</em> to be synthetic, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone know the more serious symptoms for the flu to watch out for? Seeing people die days after finding out they had it is so bizarre. I know that the flu can resemble a common cold but way more intense. Are there specific symptoms that you can develop to say to yourself shit, I gotta go to the hospital? Because  I know I wouldn’t go to the hospital if I felt sick because I’d just think it’s a cold or something. Maybe if I had strep I’d go. But it’s scary that now if I start to feel symptoms of a cold I wouldn’t know whether or not I should go or wait it out like any person would do when they feel “sick” (btw I’m not feeling sick, just started to get paranoid now)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got hit super hard- went to the dr they sent me home with a steroid shot and told me bad bronchitis just need to ride it out. I didn&#39;t sleep for 3 nights pouring sweat coughing so hard i was throwing up and in excruciating pain with every breath, it wasn&#39;t going away it was getting worse. I don&#39;t remember 3 days i was so out of it, my husband drove me back to urgent care and they were seemingly annoyed I was back again- just a cold virus and bronchitis nothing we can do- but I knew it was beyond that as I have never felt so sick before. I had a verbal argument with the dr that i was not being dramatic that there was something seriously wrong and I needed bloodwork and chest x rays and I wasn&#39;t leaving until they figured it out. X-rays showed pretty bad pneumonia in both lungs and the tech said he  surprised I was there and not in the ER rushed and got the dr. the doctor&#39;s demeanor changed when she saw the X-rays and loaded me up on meds said if I&#39;m not better after antibiotics go to hospital. That dr sent me home the first time without taking my symptoms seriously and doing full tests. Thank god i went back and fought with her to run tests.. i don&#39;t have insurance so also the reason i was hesitant to back a second time and pay it if pocket again within 3 days. And i was nervous that i was just overreacting and being a wuss about a bout of bronchitis... no. You know your body. You know when something is wrong. </p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m saying is you&#39;ll know. If you really aren&#39;t feeling well- feeling disoriented, in a lot of pain, or a sense of something is not right. go to a dr. and ask for all the tests and don&#39;t leave until you feel comfortable going home and treating it. It&#39;s better to have them find out it&#39;s just a bad cold then to have something serious unknown and just try and tough it out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can, and do (most recent vaccines have had a H3N2 and a H1N1 strain). The problem is that the virus is constantly mutating (a strain of H3N2 from this year won&#39;t be the same as one from last year), so you have to predict which mutation/strain is likely to be prevalent in a given year. Sometimes we get that wrong, or the virus mutates in unexpected ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antibiotics for a missed pneumonia diagnosis is an overly complicated solution? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t take them often, and tried everything else, this was one time I feel as if I really needed them. And am making sure to take probiotics and am drinking steeped ginger root, turmeric root, and honey which was the only think my body didn&#39;t reject for days before hand. After this is cleared up and am strong enough I would love to do a detox and clean out and reboot. </p>

<p>They asked when to see a dr and how so many people were becoming severely ill or dying. I was just telling a story of how a doctor dismissed  my concerns about my symptoms as overreactions when in reality I was very ill. Which happens in many pneumonia or flu cases. Also- no health insurance so people cannot afford healthcare. </p>

<p>I feel like I won&#39;t post on here in awhile as posts get constantly ripped apart and pitchforked. I&#39;m going back to being a reader. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I believe intravenously it is synthetic and for things like cancer then of course the benefits out weigh the risks. Forgive me, I am still learning about all of this but synthetic causes an imbalance in copper. I have been trying to understand all the ins and outs of it all and the best place to learn this is <a href="http://www.gotmag.org">www.gotmag.org</a> and the magnesium advocacy FB page. I&#39;m not sure if people understand the repercussions of unbalanced minerals and these two places answer so many questions. I am completely fascinated by the information provided. I just wish I was smart enough to understand it all the first time I read it. My husband has lost the ability to use his left so I spend many hours educating myself there to hopefully get him lined back out. Thank you for asking in a genuine manner about my post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point. I usually assume that flu is when I have the cold symptoms, but when they&#39;re more extreme like with really drastic temperature changes (overheating then cold sweats), and also being sick. I don&#39;t feel nauseous with a cold, but on the occasions I think I have the flu it&#39;s the nausea that seemingly confirms it. The main symptoms are usually over in 2-3 days though, but I will spend the rest of the week coughing: partly to get the remaining shit out my lungs, and partly because all the coughing roughs up my throat, making me cough more. But yeah, I think whatever my brother got must have been the legit hard-hitting flu that had been going round at that time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me either and never had the flu. I don&#39;t trust being injected with a partially dead virus to gain immunity from it. You get the flu right after you have the shot. And pretty much you also get the flu when it goes around.</p>
