        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I see people in my everyday life and they just seem to be carried around by other people&#39;s flows. 
Social media,the actual media,the entertainment industry and so on.
And this guys who provide normal people the material to keep riding in a circle don&#39;t know where they&#39;re going themselves. Of course, they&#39;re going somewhere, but I doubt it is in the right direction when the effect they cause on normal people is to be stagnant and not question things.
People need to wake up and I&#39;m not talking about the bigger picture with all the conspiracies and such I&#39;m actually talking about common sense in some type of way.</p>

<p>There are endless exampes I could give:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do parents let children consume all that shit on the internet? It makes no sense.</li>
<li>Why do we pass so much time online when we have endless possibilities in our real life?</li>
<li>Why are people so fast to put labels on everything and not stop for a second and think for themselves?</li>
<li>Why are people buying shit they don&#39;t need?</li>
<li>Why do people think and are pretty confident that they&#39;re living when they&#39;re not?</li>
</ul>

<p>In my personal opinion they have been fooled and the answers are right in front of they&#39;re eyes but they can&#39;t see them.</p>

<p>I think the new technologies have had a very bad impact on the world and everybody.
Globalization and the way we started connecting grew in us a need to do things faster. 
Corporations capitalised on this false need (life is not too short to go to the library and read a book or listen thoroughly to an album you bought to really get a grasp on the artist creativity) and started closing the gap between us and the things (talk to a friend,read a book,listen to music,shop) we want.
We can argue all day about the fact that the new technologies made life easier and I&#39;m all for that but this is true only for a small percentage of the total population.
In the grand scale people just became lazy,dumb,indifferent and unwilling to get educated cause they can look on google for everything so no worries. 
We&#39;re living in a fast moving world which is losing his meaning and people are becoming numb to everything in every second that passes. </p>

<p>We went from the art that poured from the soul of gifted human beings generations to the turn up of the ego cause my soul is asleep generation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 22 so I&#39;m a part of this generation and what I&#39;m gonna do is keep listening to my collection of old music and read my books. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading I really needed to let this out.</p>

<p>Edit: 
Life is strange and God keeps giving us signs.
I was walking in a street near my house and this woman told to a man : You shouldn&#39;t focus too much on the fact that people are sheep. I know they are but it&#39;s not like you can do anything about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find evidence for that in what people are creating and consuming. Of course they&#39;re living I mean they&#39;re alive but in my opinion it&#39;s the soul that isn&#39;t living good.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I get that. My problem with this kind of observation is that life is shit for the average person no matter where you are, and we’re all mostly trudging through it trying to find a little bit of something that makes us happy. </p>

<p>I’m happy that books and old records are your thing, but for some people that “thing” is very different and I have a very hard time begrudging anyone for doing what they need to do to get by (obviously as long as it’s not hurting anyone else).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that people should focus on more important things than just the total bullshit they focus on mostly. Like love and thinking for themselves. The old records and books were just a mere example of things you could do to get a glimpse of real living.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see people in my everyday life and they just seem to be carried around by other people&#39;s flows. </p>

<p>iirc, there was a study that showed like 95% of people exhibit &quot;sheep-like behaviors&quot; such as blindly following the sheep in front of them. </p>

<p>i think the experiment amounted to leading people into a dead-end alley or something </p>

<p>people are often derisively referred to as &quot;sheep&quot;</p>

<p>the Bible says &quot;i send you out as sheep among wolves&quot; </p>

<p>Jesus was (metaphorically?) a shepherd, and a shepherd leads sheep</p>

<p>the goat who leads sheep the slaughter is called a &quot;Judas Goat&quot;, and Judas goat can be used metaphorically to describe someone like Anderson Cooper or pretty much any media personality, politician, etc ... &quot;leaders&quot;</p>

<p>the take away from this is that while it is fun to notice how other people are sheep-like, nobody wants to look at how they are themselves sheep-like. </p>

<p>it is foolish to assume that you are not a sheep yourself. it would be wise to be true to yourself, and realize that human nature is sheep-like, and that you are no better than the other sheep.</p>

<p>be aware that you are a sheep among wolves... and there are indeed wolves, some of the wolves wear sheep clothes. </p>

<p>this is so spot-on. they know if they can keep you mesmerized they can convince you of anything.</p>

<p>and for generations this has been the case. the owners of the press/media got to dictate &quot;reality&quot; to the public, and the public is too busy to fact-check the news, and accepts it as their own reality</p>

<p>i suppose at some point parents just have to give their kids the freedom to explore the world.</p>

<p>before the internet, there were books on human anatomy at the pubic library. </p>

<p>would my parents like me to be looking at that? </p>

<p>perhaps they were glad i found it there so they didn&#39;t have to explain it. maybe they knew the books were there from when they were young and curious about their own body.  </p>

<p>i know theres a lot of bad stuff out there, so maybe parents need to have regular conversations about safety and security</p>

<p>to compare: card games on a computer to get new computer users trained at using a mouse to complete a task, kids learn basics of internet and hopefully are engaged with social-media thru their parents, for example, parent might send child a music video that they think they might like, and child sends back a video he found on youtube after watching the one he was sent</p>

<p>because when you sit at a table of 4, you will be the only one not using a mobile... so after a while you pull out your mobile...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are people so fast to put labels on everything and not stop for a second and think for themselves?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>brilliant question! would like to expand on this later...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are people buying shit they don&#39;t need?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;consumer-driven economy&quot; </p>

<p>basically, or economic model requires selling everyone a double cheese burger extra value meal super sized, when a simple salad and water would suffice  </p>

<p>if you can learn to be satisfied with less, your money will go a lot farther, and you will probably be healthier. calorie-restriction diets have shown to increase lifespan of worms and other lab creatures. </p>

<p>be hungry every day. hunger makes you think differently </p>

<p>you will have a natural, slim body, as opposed to the epidemic of obesity you see </p>

<p>your knees and back will last longer. your posture will be better. </p>

<p>this is a metaphor for other areas of you life, like cars, houses, clothes, etc</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do people think and are pretty confident that they&#39;re living when they&#39;re not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>another young person once asked why the adults weren&#39;t doing something about problems X,Y and Z</p>

<p>and then she said, &quot;and then i had kids... and then i understood where all the adults were... they were busy raising kids...&quot;  </p>

<p>so there is just a short window of opportunity in most peoples lives to &quot;live&quot; before the realities of life set in, and you have a family, a mortgage, a job with a paycheck</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my personal opinion they have been fooled and the answers are right in front of they&#39;re eyes but they can&#39;t see them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes you are right, but do not despair quite yet</p>

<p>to you, the internet has always existed. </p>

<p>but to the old people, the internet is this &quot;new fangled thing that they hear referenced on their TV sometimes&quot; </p>

<p>i politely asked my elderly neighbor to have her family hook her up. now she has an iPad and Facebook. not ideal, but thats where her people are so thats where she would &quot;get&quot; social media. she might not appreciate 4chan ... yet ...</p>

<p>i gave her a run-down of all the most popular &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; on here. i think she believed me</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the new technologies have had a very bad impact on the world and everybody. </p>

<p>putting our lives online has provided content for NSA server farms, which are then used against the people, like Trump for example. follow FISA court drama  </p>

<p>Globalization and the way we started connecting grew in us a need to do things faster. Corporations capitalised on this false need </p>

<p>look in the mirror. </p>

<p>think of the foods you eat, and where the ingredients originated. think of the fuel you burn, the lights you leave on, etc</p>

<p>its a cliche,  but so true.. &quot;be the change you want to see&quot; </p>

<p>its amazing the power you have as a consumer, to shift even a single penny from one place to another, or not. you have &quot;the power of the purse&quot; so learn how to use that as a carrot and stick</p>

<p>use your money to reward and punish those who deserve it </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(life is not too short to go to the library and read a book or listen thoroughly to an album you bought to really get a grasp on the artist creativity) and started closing the gap between us and the things (talk to a friend,read a book,listen to music,shop) we want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>another astute observation. it seems our attention spans have been reduced to the length of a meme</p>

<p>but there are those who are seeking and craving the books and albums, and sharing them.</p>

<p>you gotta figure, to an old person, you had to have some physical media, such as a record, or asset tape, or CD or etc</p>

<p>the concept of Youtube is still foreign to many people, in the sense that they don&#39;t understand that they can upload a video to youtube, and therefore they don&#39;t understand where youtube videos come from. </p>

<p>Time Magazine Person of the Year 2006 was &quot;You&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(Time_Person_of_the_Year)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(Time_Person_of_the_Year)</a> </p>

<p>its worthy to note that most new internet users first interactions on the internet are done on a mobile device.</p>

<p>old people don&#39;t understand this either. they think of internet as desktop computers, which might have been on a desk, occupying an entire room of the house (den, man cave). the concept of the internet being &quot;mobile&quot; is new to them.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can argue all day about the fact that the new technologies made life easier and I&#39;m all for that but this is true only for a small percentage of the total population. In the grand scale people just became lazy,dumb,indifferent and unwilling to get educated cause they can look on google for everything so no worries. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>again, its worthy to note how old people look at the internet</p>

<p>before the internet, if you wanted to &quot;fact check&quot; or otherwise look something up, it required you to go to the public library. to most people, this was incredibly inconvenient and cumbersome, and usually not worth the effort, so very few people bothered to look stuff up. if your local library didn&#39;t have what you needed, they could borrow it thru an inter-library loan, which made you wait for your book to get shipped from wherever. </p>

<p>when the internet first came out, there was a certain language that accompanied it</p>

<p>like commercials would say a website name as &quot;www dot example dot com&quot; which eventually evolved into phrases like  &quot;Facebook me&quot;  </p>

<p>if you didn&#39;t clearly communicate your web address, your customers would not be able to find your web site easily the first try </p>

<p>&quot;blogging&quot; was invented by a guy who merely posted links to interesting sites on his own web site. this seems trivial now, with billions of bloggers. but not that long ago, this was a new idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>when &quot;Google&quot; came out, all the techie nerds were out evangelizing google and the conversations went like </p>

<p>1 &quot;have you heard of Google?&quot;</p>

<p>0 &quot;no, whats google ?</p>

<p>1 &quot;its a search engine!&quot;</p>

<p>0 &quot;whats a search engine?&quot;</p>

<p>1 &quot;lets go see!&quot;</p>

<p>0 (goes to google dot com).... sits there looking blankly at the white screen with a search box</p>

<p>1 search for something!</p>

<p>0 like what?</p>

<p>1 anything!</p>

<p>0 like what?</p>

<p>today, you already know what you are going to google before you go to google. </p>

<p>but at one time, people were so used to NOT looking stuff up, it was a new concept to &quot;google&quot; something, so they had to be trained</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re living in a fast moving world which is losing his meaning and people are becoming numb to everything in every second that passes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>we as consumers are rapidly shifting away from a supply-push model of media, </p>

<p>to a demand-pull model of media. </p>

<p>i introduced &quot;youtube&quot; to an old person by sitting them down at their computer and having them go to youtube and then ask them what song they liked in high school, and of course it was on youtube, and i didn&#39;t need to explain anymore. </p>

<p>now people regularly go to youtube to learn how to fix stuff. this is an amazing resource that was never available before, and its &quot;on demand&quot; which means that video is ready when you are ready to see it, as opposed to being pushed on you when its less relevant. </p>

<p>again, this is such a new idea to everyone, only since Youtube ~2006  </p>

<p>people are beginning to find the important stuff, and share it with other relevant people</p>

<p>every day everyone on the internet gets a little bit smarter about something  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We went from the art that poured from the soul of gifted human beings generations to the turn up of the ego cause my soul is asleep generation.</p>

<p>art and music were deliberately destroyed by (evil?) forces </p>

<p>I&#39;m 22 so I&#39;m a part of this generation and what I&#39;m gonna do is keep listening to my collection of old music and read my books.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading I really needed to let this out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as a young person, you will bombarded with &quot;must see&quot; movies etc that are, quite frankly, not that important </p>

<p>&quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; come to mind</p>

<p>i would say the single most important &quot;must read&quot; would be the bible</p>

<p>please subscribe  <a href="/r/TheBible">/r/TheBible</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/vesejpww28jz.jpg">https://i.redd.it/vesejpww28jz.jpg</a></p>

<p>some reasons i say the bible is &quot;must read&quot; is not necessarily to evangelize Christianity, </p>

<p>but rather to say its so important in understanding your own culture, regardless if you or even your family considers themselves &quot;Christians&quot; or not. </p>

<p>basically, if you speak English, you are influenced by Christian culture, for better or worse. </p>

<p>and the centerpiece of that Christian culture is the bible</p>

<p>instead of trying to read the bible like a regular book, from front to back...</p>

<p>try reading the bible in smaller, bite size pieces, when the time is right for you to understand that verse, which is usually right about the time you hear the verse. </p>

<p>in other words, every time you hear a verse referenced in any context, stop what you are doing and read that verse and try to understand why someone would be sharing it and in what context, which is important to verse sharing    </p>

<p>there are so many little sayings in the English language that originate in the bible, which are used in everyday language, but are only meaningful to those who understand the verses. </p>

<p>&quot;give up the ghost&quot; comes out of the bible. </p>

<p>as you know and understand more verses, you will find yourself in a situation where these verses are relevant, and then you will remember them and share them </p>

<p>from a language and linguistics point of view, the bible is a very interesting case study, because it is the source material for so much of our language</p>

<p>there are so many little (and big) truths found in the language, if you stop to analyze the root words etc </p>

<p>for example:</p>

<p>&quot;creator&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;create&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;creation&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;creatures&quot;</p>

<p>i think theres a dig at atheists somewhere in the bible, something about a creature doubting his creator</p>

<p>the first book ever printed on the Gutenberg Press was a bible, and the bible has been printed more times than any other book </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the points you brought up I really appreciate your answer.</p>

<p>We really do have a great power in our hands when it comes to what we consume I agree on that.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t focus on the way old people perceive the internet because I thought that the future is in the young generations but at the same time the young people are getting there knowledge from the old people so this means that between our generations we will always have a disinformation/lack of knowledge gap that will never disappear. 
I can imagine the new things that are going to come out and how we will feel when we wont be able to fully understand what will we say to our children?</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I strongly believe we need to be more aware of our life in general and what we consume like you said and not jump right on in this band wagons but pay attention to things first and consume them moderately. </p>

<p>Wish you all the best thank you for your reply I really enjoyed reading it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The quest for the truth is a long journey that&#39;s best walked alone. Most people are on auto pilot and unable to be helped. It&#39;s self  realization that must  occur before understanding becomes your new focus. Unfortunately, self realization can&#39;t be forced. It happens on it&#39;s own time frame.</p>

<p>A homeless man and the enlightened sage both tell you their truth, which is useless on your journey. Look within for the answers, they are all there. The moment it becomes externalized no answer will be found,only distractions. Question everything, research you answers and you&#39;ll be on a great start to finding your truth. Good luck .</p>
