        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For Newtown, there is no proof. No images/videos were ever released. All we got was Obummer on TV crying tears claiming that many lives were lost.</p>

<p>The media never showed us any pictures. There is no photographic evidence.</p>

<p>It was a false flag operation by the deep state to take away our guns. They do not want us to stay free.</p>

<p>More recently, with the LV shooting, Paddock had at least 7 accomplices. Again, photographic evidence of the hotel room has not been released. They have not come forward with any detailed information. How is possible that he got all those weapons up there in that room by himself? It&#39;s not possible. He had help. Members of that hotel security were part of a covert group tasked with helping him carry out the assault.</p>

<p>Paddock wasn&#39;t supposed to die. Mark my words he had an escape plan ready but things went south because either someone in the deep state turned on him leaving him for dead or something went horribly wrong and they had to cut their losses. Mark my words we weren&#39;t supposed to find out his identity. Their plan was for him to shoot everyone and escape, then the media spin would be that it&#39;s too easy for criminals to get guns and gun mods and that our government agencies (under Trump) are ineffective. </p>

<p>The whole thing was to make Trump look bad. It is very disheartening that 500 people were injured and or died.</p>

<p>Vegas was a big fuckup. Don&#39;t know who, how, what or why, but it clearly did not go as planned, because it&#39;s been a media clusterfuck since it happened, and usually Deep State&#39;s got that shit locked down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is the consideration that Newtown caused people to be skeptical earlier in the game and to be vocal about the idiosyncrasies. I wonder how well SH would&#39;ve taken hold if it &quot;happened&quot; today.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that it was a gun grab- I honestly think both were &quot;warning shots&quot; to anyone that is trustworthy in government to toe the line. </p>

<p>It does amaze me how sloppy they are, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a whole, the long-running &quot;conspiracy&quot; to fake mass shootings has only increased gun ownership in this country, increased the stock prices of gun and ammunition manufacturers, and led to an overall net decrease in gun control laws.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve posited an incredibly powerful government conspiracy against guns, and then relied on a fact-set that shows that same alleged group to have accomplished the exact opposite of their aims.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re going with <em>actual</em> cause and effect, here, the top-level conspirators are PRO-gun, not anti-gun. But I don&#39;t think that can fit within your point of view, can it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The newtown thing was hijacked.  The shooting really happened and the fbi/cia stepped in and embelished it for the reasons you stated.  For example, Lanza did not kill 23 people with an assault rifle.  He killed people with a handgun though.</p>

<p>the Vegas thing was more of a coverup than a hijack imo.  Some gun deal went wrong and so they spun what happened to avoid admitting what actually went down</p>
