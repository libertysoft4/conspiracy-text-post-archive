<p>The president said that the mistake was “a state thing,” but that “we are going to now get involved in that.” He declined to answer a question about what the federal government would do to try to make sure that a mistaken alert like the one in Hawaii is not sent out again.</p>

<p>“I love that they took responsibility,” he said of the state officials in Hawaii. “They took total responsibility. But we are going to get involved. Their attitude and their — I think it is terrific. They took responsibility. They made a mistake.”</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure they work closely with the military, but these sirens and warnings use vastly different platforms than the military. And the military doesn&#39;t really have any jurisdiction over civilians.</p>

<p>Yeah. This is new, only recently had there even been the threat if an ICBM. Emergency Management functions are usually underfunded because 99% of the tine they aren&#39;t used until shit hits the fan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so help me understand. </p>

<p>What happened to trigger that warning? </p>

<p>It makes sense that the actual sirens and warning systems are controlled by the states. Tsunamis and earthquakes in hawaii, tornado warnings in the Midwest, amber alerts etc. But who is in charge of the &#39;missile attack sensors&#39;? states? That seems like a military function. </p>

<p>There&#39;s various levels of individuals that have the power to issue alerts for their respective areas </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is it was a lot easier to send an alert than rescind one for liability reasons. </p>

<p>It probably takes a director level person that was probably out in the beach and took a bit to get a hold of.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this happened. I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s my thoughts on how it could have been a mistake and taken too long to fix </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well - 40 minutes for another text alert saying false alarm. It took time because they didn’t have a template to send out such an alert and had to put one together .  Now they do, so they can send out false alarm quickly if needed.  This has been widely reported </p>

<p>People who turned to news find out if this was real figured it out quickly.  Air traffic control quickly disregarded it..</p>

<p>The people freaking out are people who jump without thinking it through.  </p>

<p>But this is different, the entire country wants to find something that will bring him down or just plain blame him for everything. </p>
