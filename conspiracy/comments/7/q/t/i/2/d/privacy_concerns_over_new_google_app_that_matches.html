<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5274357/New-Google-app-sparks-privacy-concerns.html">Google told MailOnline that uploaded images aren&#39;t used for any other purpose and are deleted after the match is made</a>.</p>

<p>But this assurance of deletion hasn&#39;t quelled concerns over facial biometrics. Could this app be for &quot;machine learning&quot; training? </p>

Google doesn&#39;t &quot;delete&quot; your search history...it&#39;s how they make all their money, what makes you think they&#39;ll delete these? And do people honestly think they aren&#39;t in cahoots with the major Five Eyes governments? Fat fucking chance. No one should trust this new software. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. If people are that gullible into thinking the tech giants do what they say, then they are in for some surprise.</p>

<p>Recently I said that google collects all your data and one of the colleague said that I&#39;m making shit up. So I asked him do you have the location tracking on his phone? I proceeded to ask him to login to google account and went into his history. Sure enough, every trip he made with his phone in pocket had info of when he took the trip, from where to where etc. Then he turned to me and said, but this info is only for me right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you use Google photos, every picture is scanned with facial recognition technology and photos are grouped together by person. If you have a contact photo for someone in your Google contacts, Google photos will even ask you if a collection of facially matched pictures is that specific contact. The technology is so good it can even match childhood and baby pictures to an adult. Furthermore the Google photos AI can even sort photos by objects and animals like dogs, cats, cars, food, trees, etc. Privacy is a thing of the past unless you want to go off the grid completely.</p>

<p>Everyone uses their smart phones with a camera pointed directly at them at all times. </p>

<p>Your phone is attached your billing information. </p>

<p>I’m fairly certain they already have a very detailed facial recognition system in place. </p>
