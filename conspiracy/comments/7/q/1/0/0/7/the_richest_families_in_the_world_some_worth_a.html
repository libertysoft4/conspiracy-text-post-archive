    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s probable that these same people set up this system to make this possible. Hence they made the rules to fit their own purpose. To me it&#39;s morally grotesque that these people have horded so much unnecessary wealth. As for any jealousy, there is none. Personally I&#39;m prefectly happy with where I&#39;m at in my middle class income. The problem is that this throws the entire world economy out of balance and puts the people at the top in full control. Along with the economy problems it also fucks with the emotional state of humans and the harmony in which we peacefully co-exist.
   For instance this extreme distribution of wealth leads to unfair proportions, which illicits negative emotions and thoughts from those who got the &quot;tiny piece of cake&quot;. This then leads to a hostile community and a shit ton of negative emotions such as jealousy, envy, and hatred. That then leads to robbery, rape, murder and do forth. So no it&#39;s not a jealousy thing in the least bit, these people are very seriously throwing all of mankind into a huge shitfunk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t horde the wealth. How much does it cost to employ 5,000 upper-middle class people? Most billionaires would be broke in a matter of weeks if they had to handle payroll at that scale out of their own pocket, not to mention retirement plans, or benefits.</p>

<p>These wealthy families, and corporations are giving careers, houses, cars, benefits, vacation time, basically a stable life in modern society in exchange for voluntary labor.</p>

<p>Both sides can benefit from a transaction, and mostly this is what happens. Very seldom do people return items, or experience buyer&#39;s remorse. </p>

<p>Find a way to negotiate with them, but the moment you apply coercion, either by taxing the money, or taking it to be redistribute, you are violating the non-aggression principle.</p>

<p>By not following the non-aggression principle you invite hostile communities, theft, rape and murder. Wealth inequality in and of itself isn&#39;t immoral, and doesn&#39;t cause these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If one family has a few trillion, why on Earth would you need that much.  Hell if you have 100 family members and give each a couple billion and you still have trillions left.  Jealousy...no.  Grotesque greed where there are people starving, sick, homeless.  I think of all the funding towards cleaner sustainable energy and better overall quality of life for all.  No it is not jealousy, this borders on cruelty to humanity (my opinion).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think some sensible progressive taxation, corporate taxes and regulation would at least spread the wealth of our society so that all could share in the prosperity. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s much of a stretch to notice that the laws/regulations etc. are tilted to consolidate power and wealth and serve those that have it. </p>

<p>On the other hand imagine the sweet revenge you could unleash upon those who wrong you with a trillion dollars. Enjoy your life ex-boyfriend/girlfriend who cheated on me. Somehow so many things in your life just mysteriously don&#39;t work out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know the best way to strip wealthy dynasties of wealth and power? Progressive tax structures that heavily tax the uber wealthy, along with estate taxes for the very wealthy. Yet the same people who hate the uber wealthy dynasties are often the very people who oppose taxing the uber rich. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But those people that are sitting in desks are doing so voluntarily. They could do something else if they wanted. You have a very simplistic way of looking at the world.  </p>

<p>Should we live in a society that is fair to you? We&#39;ll use u/K722&#39;s system of distribution. I&#39;m sorry if I come across as a jackass, from my point of view you&#39;re a thief.  </p>

<p>Should we take Bill Gate&#39;s wealth? Well, no. Him being wealthy helps all of us. Now we get to use a cool computer, and he donates a significant amount to charity.  </p>

<p>People being wealthy is not a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The OP doesnt realize that the masses who unthinkingly buy from shithole companies like Amazon, where everything is slave made Chinese shit, make it worse for everyone.</p>

<p>The super rich like Bezos and his kind would not have been rich to begin with if we lived in a truly capitalist society with a truly free market.</p>

<p>Looting the unethical rich is fine by me, because people like Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, Soros the Rothschilds and their kind deserve prison, not mansions.</p>

<p>But its important to remember that these people are rich either through asshole governments that could be overthrown by the people or by assholes who dont care if they fund dlave labour with their iPhone purchases.</p>
