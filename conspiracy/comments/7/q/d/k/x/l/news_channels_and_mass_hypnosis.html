        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We&#39;ve likely all seen a hypnotist demonstration at some time or another. What is the point of hypnosis in its most basic explanation? </p>

<p>&quot;A waking state in which the subject is tremendously relaxed, so relaxed as to allow an intensity of focus unavailable otherwise, and in which the subject is very suggestible.&quot;</p>

<p>Emphasis on &quot;very suggestible.&quot; As in, we relax our usual instinct to question what we&#39;re being told, while still being highly focused on WHAT we&#39;re being told.</p>

<p>There are covert and overt hypnosis techniques, one the subject is aware they&#39;re being hypnotized, in the other they are not.</p>

<p>We all have probably seen an old school hypnosis wheel. In which moving circles were used as the focus to ease someone into a hypnosis state combined with a countdown. For the purpose of this thread we&#39;ll cover this technique.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you ever found yourself “zoning out” and staring at an interesting item in the room while someone is talking? Did you completely miss what they’ve said? You may have been in a trance.</p>

<p>Any object of focus can be used to induce trance. The most famous examples are the “power pendulum” or a “swinging pocket watch” – although these two objects are now associated with hokey stage hypnosis. You’re more likely to fail and encounter resistance using these objects, due to their reputation.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, there are two secrets behind eye fixation. First, the object keeps the conscious mind occupied, opening the subconscious to suggestion. Secondly, your eyes get physically tired when they fixate or move back and forth.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://britishhypnosisresearch.com/hypnosis-techniques/">https://britishhypnosisresearch.com/hypnosis-techniques/</a></p>

<p>Now, have you ever wondered why nearly every news station starts out their news segment with very similar intros? Down to the repetitive music? Let&#39;s look at a few and let&#39;s see what the common theme is: (these clips are all very short.)</p>

<p>CNN: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=B_Wj_ZYtZ1Y">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=B_Wj_ZYtZ1Y</a></p>

<p>Fox: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IMJUMoN8k1k">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IMJUMoN8k1k</a></p>

<p>Msnbc: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ChkBvDnfXG4">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ChkBvDnfXG4</a></p>

<p>BBC: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QzKbzLpoE4c">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QzKbzLpoE4c</a></p>

<p>ABC: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MiJtsRe8MOE">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MiJtsRe8MOE</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s just a few examples for the sake of time. Feel free to post your own below as well. </p>

<p>If you watched all of those you&#39;ll see a very clear pattern, and this is no mistake. The combination of moving patterns combined with a countdown is designed to put you in a more suggestible state that resembles hypnosis. Now the fun part is watching how often that technique is used throughout news segments. Next time you watch the news (if you still do that) see how many you can notice for yourself. </p>

I don&#39;t listen to noise very much, and when I do catch the News and hear the words &quot;I THINK&#39; coming from an empty suit or a hollow skirt, I know it&#39;s not even noise...

    <div class="md"><p>And we wonder why people have fallen into such things as Trump Derangement Syndrome. These news casts are drilling it into their heads of how god awful he is, confirming and fueling such hatred. Even if they are not directly calling him names or reporting his latest tweet, they have a thinly veiled snarl even when they speak his name. It’s rather scary to watch this taking over a nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could also argue that that &#39;tell lie vision&#39; programming has influenced you to thinking, and therefore into accepting the political system. Although I agree with you, Trump has very negative press for those who control the media despise him, he truly is a horrible man for things he has done, without media coverage. His moves over Jerusalem, his attack on Syria, his behind the closed doors dealings with multiple cases, his corruption, his scandals, these are all true. Of course what the media focuses on, such as his Russia connection are nothing but lies and propaganda.
It is a double bluff.
Leading people to being either pro trump, or pro media knowing that Trump is a house of cards ready to fall at the sight of pressure. The game is rigged.
The truth is, they are both evil. You must leave the hamster wheel and realize Trump is the enemy of the people, just as the media is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His moves over Jerusalem have been promised by every President for the last two decades.

    <div class="md"><p>I am referring to cases such as a &#39;secret&#39; dealing Trump made with a former Porn star by giving her $130,000 in exchange for her silence on his affair on his run up to presidency and if it was not for her silence, as is possible, it makes you question, what was it for?</p>

<p>And in terms of Trump, surely you must realize by now that no one makes it to President Of The United States without being puppeteer ed, and if you don&#39;t believe that, look for example at Trump&#39;s rhetoric over Iran, he is setting the stage for a future war with Iran, this is evident, Iran let me remind you was listed under countries to regime change by the Project for the New American Century one month before the 9/11 attacks and all others have been achieved, next on the list is Iran, and then North Korea, both countries Trump is increasing rhetoric over, not to mention that he has alligned himself with Israel much more than other US Presidents; his own son in law has known Netanyahu since he was a child and recieves payments for his businesses indirectly from the Israeli Govt.
Not to mention, Trump&#39;s endless meetings with both Israel and Saudi Arabia, the two countries in the Middle East capable and willing to engage in a war with Iran.</p>
