    <div class="md"><p>Its hard too actually evaluate ideas behind a pay wall... but his dismissal of carbon dating because he claims it “can’t be verified” and atoms might not exist ignores tons of math and science and geology. Carbon dating can be verified using geologic principles like real rock layers and arctic core samples.For anyone who studies college level physical chemistry, physics, math etc atoms are pretty compelling. For people who do chemistry or biochemistry or physics their work and observable pheromona seem to fit with our understanding of atomic theory although quantum theory did upturn quite a bit of science. He simply seems ignorant or contrarian... just because he doesn’t understand a concept doesn’t make the concept wrong... but I wouldn’t know because I would have to pay him to see all his arguments... </p>

<p>And since he is not a scholar of ancient Greeks, and as far as I can tell has nit visited archeological sites, read the works of sncyrnrs Greeks, studied contemporary sources in the original language why should I find his claims compelling and pay this guy to tell me how to think?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not <em>that</em> familiar with his stuff to really be able to comment. That being said you should know there are highly educated academics that have very <em>very</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_hypothesis">heterodox views of history.</a></p>

<p>Also, atoms are a model, an abstraction. They don&#39;t exist stricto sensu; an &quot;atom&quot; is mostly empty space, made of few/distant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle">elementary particles</a>, whose interactions will determine what the &quot;atoms&quot; will be/look like.

<p>And frankly, there are many so widely accepted beliefs that have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_versus_intentionalism">recently been debunked</a>, or that are in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_centre_of_Earth#History_of_geo-centroid_calculation">process of being debunked</a>, that I&#39;d find it arrogant to be too certain of our current canonical understandings.

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly aren’t a scientist. No scientist thinks we have perfect knowledge. We are only beginning to understand quantum and sub atomic interactions. We still don’t have a unified theory of physics. What we do have is mathematically derived hypothesis that we can test with experiments and predict the observed results. This has allowed us to create models for how atoms behave and even approximate models of molecules. Now these are models and visualizations but the models largely work and are continuously refined and updated. We can see cellular level objects with electron microscopy and smaller objects with X-ray crystallography. They can
detect sub atomic particles in large colliders. I don’t mind people questioning, but it bothers me when people question when they haven’t developed and understanding of the centuries of mathematical, physical and chemical theoretical and experimental work that has been done. Simply these equations allow
us to create nuclear power plants, modern polymers, modern medical imaging, etc... </p>

<p>There is a difference in science between testing and challenging theories and claiming that since the theory isn’t 100% worked out that the whole thing is garbage.</p>

<p>But this Jon Bon is a cheap dirty salesman, he even has a couple condescending  video about how  conspiracy theorists don’t like him... so he can distance himself from the fringe and be the real source of truth... this guy is money grubbing snake oil salesman...</p>

<p>I actually am, but I have graduated a long time ago, which as you will see will make you more humble about what you think you now.

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t have an personal knowledge of centuries of learning and my understanding of quantum is pretty limited as it does not directly affect my work... I do know that in my little corner of science phsyfiak and chemical principles have held up and while they are continuously tweaked I can reasonably say atoms likely exist and from my understanding and talking to friends in related fields things like evolution, carbon dating, plate tectonics, etc have largely held up. </p>

<p>I understand that much of what we know evolves and changes and that things understood as fact even a decade ago are overturned, but so far atomic theory has evolved but held. Sure sting theory fell apart and we have really a limited understanding of how orbitals and individual atoms interact.</p>

<p>And I don’t know why you think I am your junior. I have been working in science on a post grad level for the past decade... for all I know you have some Bachelor of Arts science from some second rate university 5 years ago and work in some unrelated position...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the condescending quotes... that are out of context and don’t apply.</p>

<p>I don’t disagree that people should question what is taught, but they should also use empirical questioning to evaluate their line of questioning...   not simplifications and intuition.  </p>

<p>You mistake me as confident or unable to ponder other hypothesis... I am not a blind follower and I am not at all confident in human knowledge as theories get tweaked and overturned regularly. But I also don’t accept any random persons musings or inturions as particuarly valuable input unless they can produce empirical and vetted evidence for their reasoning... basically the scientific method.</p>

<p>Finally, I accept that I won’t be able to personally get every piece of human knowledge myself. Some is beyond me. I am not smart enough. I cannot understand a lot of cosmology. I don’t get a lot of hawkings work or work at cern. But I do trust that peer review has vetted these ideas and as such will text and challenge them to see if they bear out... but I know I cannot retest every theory or principal. That would be onerous and paralyzing... sometimes you have to trust others too...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t see his arguments since they are behind a paywall... hence the accusation of a dirty snake oil salesman... But I am not a physicist or geologist or or paleontologist. I did once cover carbon dating in physics courses and it seemed to largely make sense at the time. The professors and books made no secret that there are inaccuracies and challenges. I covered enough geology to recognize plate tetonic theory seems to make sense. And I know enough chemistry to understand the basics of fossil creation. I know a fair bit about biochemistry and biology and statistics to appreciate and understand evolutionary theories. Putting it all together, the case for dinosaurs and the various eras, supported with other data regarding climate and atmospheric conditions in different eras it all generally fits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A variety of methods, from geological strata and formations to mineral composition of surrounding soil etc. Its not perfect... you are dating things that are millions of years old but it can help get a ball park... There are some compelling fossils, with dates the largely fit what we know about plate tectonics, geology, evolution, and carbon dating... for sure details of such creatures do evolve... things like coloring, feathers, behavior, intelligence are very hard to extrapolate. Appearance can be hard to recreate without seeing the musculature or often a complete skeleton... but the disparate pieces of the fossils fit to support dinosaurs and other life forms that preceded earth.</p>

<p>Why I struggle is with why people doubt that creatures might have predated man and the many have gone extinct and that these creatures being earlier in the evolutionary tree and evolved under different conditions might have looked very different from modern creatures. </p>

<p>It would be the height of hubris to think that humans somehow had to there from the beginning rather than part of a prolonged evolutionary process from single cell organisms to modern day creatures with many dead ends along the way and that to get to the complexity of modern humans it would take evolution millions of years?</p>

<p>What are you arguing? That dinosaurs are less old or older than scientists claim, or do you just believe carbon dating inaccurate? But then what about earlier methods like geological strata? Or evolutionary studies? Or that where we find certain dinosaur fossil fits plate tetonics? Or do you just believe that its all a carefully orchestrated hoax?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re too hopeful. When they did that survey of the Sphinx and found cavities underneath, Hawass himself went in, didn&#39;t take pictures, veiled the dig so no one could see, said &quot;there are caves but they&#39;re natural formations, guess that settles that&quot; and has prevented anyone else from looking ever since. We&#39;re not gonna get to see.</p>

<p>I mean shit, they won&#39;t even let that team who used the robot to explore the shafts in the main chamber back into the great pyramid to do more work on that new room <em>they</em> found</p>

<p>But Zahi Hawass, who heads the ScanPyramids science committee overseeing the project, said there was no new “discovery”. He said he had met other scientists from ScanPyramids who “showed us their conclusions, and we informed them this is not a discovery,” he told AFP. “The pyramid is full of voids and that does not mean there is a secret chamber or a new discovery,” he said. “The project has to proceed in a scientific way that follows the steps of scientific research and its discussion before publication,” he added.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is some evidence to suggest that some of the erosion on the Sphinx and the Pyramids (of Giza at least) may have been caused by water and not just wind and sand, and if I remember right, also suggests that they are <em>much</em> older than the narrative suggests.</p>

<p>I personally believe they were used for ceremonies and initiation into hermetic mystery religions and the like. You should check out Manly P Hall&#39;s discussion on it</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cyzX-Gj43Gk">https://youtu.be/cyzX-Gj43Gk</a></p>

<p>If you&#39;re not into an hour long video, here&#39;s an excerpt from his book <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta09.htm">The Secret Teachings of All Ages</a> which I highly recommend if you&#39;re in to this kind of thing</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the King&#39;s Chamber was enacted the drama of the &quot;second death.&quot; Here the candidate, after being crucified upon the cross of the solstices and the equinoxes, was buried in the great coffer. There is a profound mystery to the atmosphere and temperature of the King&#39;s Chamber: it is of a peculiar deathlike cold which cuts to the marrow of the bone. This room was a doorway between the material world and the transcendental spheres of Nature. While his body lay in the coffer, the soul of the neophyte soared as a human-headed hawk through the celestial realms, there to discover first hand the eternity of Life, Light, and Truth, as well as the illusion of Death, Darkness, and Sin. Thus in one sense the Great Pyramid may be likened to a gate through which the ancient priests permitted a few to pass toward the attainment of individual completion. It is also to be noted incidentally that if the coffer in the King&#39;s Chamber be struck, the sound emitted has no counterpart in any known musical scale. This tonal value may have formed part of that combination of circumstances which rendered the King&#39;s Chamber an ideal setting for the conferment of the highest degree of the Mysteries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I was being purposely vague about it...I&#39;m a christian but not one of those bible thumper types.  I personally think that a flood happened like the bible says but I don&#39;t believe that those people weren&#39;t Tech advanced like our history books say.  Who knows what the pyramids were for they could have been power stations but to say they put a single ruler in there as a grave...is asinine.  There is a cover up going on. Bible also says there were giants back then and there is evidence supporting that.  So yeah just another dude looking for the truth the more I dig it seems the less I know. </p>
