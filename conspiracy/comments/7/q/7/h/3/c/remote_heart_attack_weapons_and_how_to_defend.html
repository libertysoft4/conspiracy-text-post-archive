        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So a bit of a strange story to tell.  My mom recently passed of a heart attack.  It was early for our family - we tend to last a while.  I found her on the couch.  I had to break in.  That was hard.  It could have been just a random thing but I don&#39;t think that was the case because I too have had heart attack symptoms in the same spot she was found.  I&#39;m house sitting, while we clear up the estate, for context.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m lying on the couch (where she was found), and I feel tingling.  I&#39;ve felt this before - I&#39;ve had sudden wakeups for a while and I&#39;ve had what I suppose are attempts on my life with remote heart attack weapons, for a while now.  There&#39;s a certain lifecycle to how it plays out.  Anyway I get this tingling, as I&#39;m trying to sleep.  I move around and it stops.  Then I&#39;m just about to doze and I get a sudden wakeup dealie.  Heart seems to skip or stop.  I become suddenly alert.  This is typical of how that goes.  I&#39;ve found if I physically move it goes away immediately.  This time was a bit different.   I feel a stab in my heart on the left side.  I&#39;ve never felt this before.  It was sharp and strong, very strong.  So I move out of the area and it immediately goes away.  Everything&#39;s back to normal.   </p>

<p>I suspect it&#39;s yet another electronic attack.  This has been happening for years now.  I move away from the area to try to find a place that&#39;s surrounded by a lot of mass, thinking the weapon won&#39;t be able to get there.  Things are fine for a while and then I feel it coming on again.  So I move to the basement near the furnace - lots of metal and a lot of mass between me and whoever is doing this.  Symptoms totally go away.  I stay there for a while hoping that they might think it&#39;s worked on me, and they won&#39;t be able to pick up a heat signature or whatever signature they use to target.  All of sudden a bright ball of light flashes in the corner of the basement.  Just for a moment, less than a second.  I&#39;m like wtf was that.  I later examine the area when it&#39;s light out and I see that there&#39;s no electronics or device or whatever that would flash.  It was totally fucking weird.</p>

<p>I go online to do some digging about the remote heart attack tech that&#39;s out there.  I come across this site - <a href="https://everydayconcerned.net/2015/08/13/holistic-doctors-sudden-cardiac-arrest-targeted-individuals-remote-radiation-heart-attack-weaponry-how-to-protect-yourself">https://everydayconcerned.net/2015/08/13/holistic-doctors-sudden-cardiac-arrest-targeted-individuals-remote-radiation-heart-attack-weaponry-how-to-protect-yourself</a>.  In it they say you should put a metal barrier between your heart and the &quot;beam&quot; or whatever it is.  So I wrap my chest in tinfoil and tape it down.  I go back to sleep.  Tingling starts all over again, but it doesn&#39;t escalate in the normal pattern.  I go back to sleep, everything is fine.  </p>

<p>This sort of sketchiness has been happening to me all my life, and I&#39;m not really sure exactly why but I suspect it has something to do with pizzagate and my father.   This is only a recent realization.  I think I&#39;ve become too much of a liability for &quot;them&quot; and the orders have come in to kill me.  There have been a few prior incidences to indicate this is what may be going on.  But this was one that was a clear message.</p>

<p>Anyway, without digressing too much from the subject.  What I ended up doing was making a tinfoil vest that covers my chest all around.  It&#39;s worked.  I&#39;ve felt the use of the weapon but it&#39;s not escalated to the sharp stabbing pain or the jaw and neck deep bone pain that had happened.  So I felt I&#39;d share this tip for anyone suspecting that this tech is being used on them.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT: as per suggestion of Mr Marmot.  apologies for the lack for formatting i was just quickly typing it out to the question asked and wasn&#39;t concerned with the formatting but just getting the info out.  it&#39;s a copy of a comment further on down in the thread.</p>

<p>re: my dad. ok so here&#39;s the story. we were estranged for 25 years or so. difficult childhood, etc. at a house party i held in the mid 2000s a guy shows up who i didn&#39;t know. he knew all about me. he knew my corporation name. he knew where i had worked. everything. he told me about pizzagate, about trump being elected, about ww3 with nk. he told me about all of my future social media account names. and he told me my dad was involved in this child trafficking thing.</p>

<p>having had many people come up to me thru my life and telling me about my future with exact precision i basically shut down and ignored it when people would do this, which was often enough. so that was how i coped with it. i felt i was being groomed for a role and i didn&#39;t know who to trust. still don&#39;t really.</p>

<p>fast forward to now. i reconnected with my dad last year. i go to his place in the country. it&#39;s a farm type place, 188 acres, in pontypool ontario. very isolated. no visibility from the road. next to a railroad track where the trains run at about 5kph. so very slow. along the rail track there are no dig signs. but this is weird since the track in on a berm with gullies beside it and there&#39;s nothing to dig there anyway. weird that they would have signs. in the new place he had built there was a bug problem. they would come up from the vents. i was told it had been going on for years. i studied this stuff in uni and that&#39;s a closed system. hvac systems are closed. if there were organic matter rotting in them it would quickly rot out or dry up. you wouldn&#39;t have bugs. so that was one sign. also i&#39;d do my laundry there. and in the laundry i&#39;d see small shirts - child sized. but there were no kids around. and in the period between visits nobody was there. on of the shirts i thought was my sisters so i put it on her bed, and she was like what&#39;s this. i said, it&#39;s from the laundry i thought it was yours. no, it wasn&#39;t. that was weird. there are no small kids around where do these shirts come from. on subsequent visits i&#39;d see other clothes that didn&#39;t make sense and didn&#39;t seem to belong to anybody. finally my dad would say things that indicated he had knowledge that he shouldn&#39;t have had about me. here&#39;s the thing - one of the strategies i had developed to out people who were not what they said they were would be to put out false data and see who would bite on it. this worked very well actually and helped me spot the degree of unwanted attention i was getting. my dad was one of the people who bit on the false data. so something was up there. so anyway what this person had told me about my dad was validated by the things i was finding. also there&#39;s a septic bed for the house that&#39;s waaaay too big for the load. it frankly looks like there&#39;s an underground structure there. also nearby the farm is a private airport. basically the property is located in a place that would be ideal for human trafficking if you were to do it underground. also, i&#39;d drop funny comments while chatting with him and his family to see their reaction. sure enough, they&#39;d bite on them, and give me feedback that indicated they could see thru the ambiguity of the things i would say. another incident we&#39;re at a farmers market and there&#39;s a little kid. i watched my dad&#39;s response to seeing the kid. it was predatory for lack of a better word. also in a neighbouring town where we would go for breakfast i&#39;d watch the reactions of the locals to my dad. some of them just stared at him. like they knew something was up. and not good stares - there was tangible malintent. these are the sort of things that were filling in the gaps. i suspect there&#39;s a fairly significant human trafficking operation going on in pontypool and it&#39;s not just at his location, but many are involved and it&#39;s known in the community amongst certain members. that&#39;s what it seems like anyway. of course there&#39;s no solid evidence to take to the authorities, not that they would listen if i did. there was a guy kevin annett who started exposing the native abuse scandals in canada and he had life ruined and became a targetted individual. this despite corroborating claims by several people of the locations and activities that he was breaking. and no investigation happened. so it&#39;s that deep in the systems here. these things are just not investigated. </p>

<p>a few people, yes.  i was tipped off about my dad years ago but we were estranged at the time and i had no means to validate it.  also i&#39;ve had lots of strange things happen to me in my lifetime and as a result for a long while i tried to ignore them.  many people know i suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s interesting how dismissive your response is.  qualified to self diagnose?  i&#39;m qualified to be rational.  i&#39;m qualified to examine the evidence and to eliminate the impossible or unlikely.  putting faith in others is just not something i do - it&#39;s Bad Design, and i could on for a while on why.  suffice it to say that authority is Bad Design.  you may disagree with this, but there&#39;s ample evidence of the failures of this design pattern that manifest in the same modalities.  so i guess we&#39;ll disagree on this.  i don&#39;t need others, who don&#39;t have the experiences, who aren&#39;t there to come to absolute conclusions about things they don&#39;t have direct experience of.</p>

<p>as to rational people and tinfoil vests.  i posted a link about the use of microwave tech.  this is known tech.  i&#39;m not making it up or inventing it out of thin air.  the application of this tech exists.  and it can create electrical and magnetic phenomenon.  so if that happens, you channel the energy with conductive material.  this is not that complicated and people have used similar things (ie. faraday cages) for the same effect.  by saying rational people don&#39;t do certain things you&#39;re applying a bias that frankly doesn&#39;t address the modality of how this tech would work.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the point is that no one is qualified to self diagnose. It’s really important for us to rely on each other and make sure everything is good and sound. While it’s certainly possible what you are experiencing is legitimately happening, it also mirrors closely some mental health issues. The only way to make sure would be to present evidence to someone close to you and see, because none of us are capable of diagnosing mental health issues of this nature effectively. </p>

<p>how would you know this?  this is a forum for exchange of ideas is it not?  particularly about unusual and abnormal phenomena.  that&#39;s the ethos of the forum.  so you&#39;re presuming that targeted individuals don&#39;t exist, despite the many accounts of it happening.  are they all lying?  and what would qualify for that experience?  could it be something like your dad is involved in human trafficking?  perhaps eh.  </p>

<p>the funny thing about your type of criticism is that it follows a playbook.  and that&#39;s a playbook that people can learn and identify.  so, yeah.. good luck.   </p>

<p>I agree. The technology is radar and ground penetrating radar. Aluminum foil does not attenuate radar:</p>

<p>the remote heart attack weapon can attack from a distance, invisibly; can send immense amounts of energy directly to the central chest region, creating a sense of congestion, pressure, and an impending heart attack; can send pencils or pulses of directed energy and subsequent pain sensations from above onto the left-side of the chest; can send pulses of directed energy from behind, near the spine; can send pulses of directed energy from underneath, near the left side of the chest, going up under the ribs; can send pulses of energy into the chest region also from the right-hand side of the chest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no wifi here.</p>

<p>re: my dad.  ok so here&#39;s the story.  we were estranged for 25 years or so.  difficult childhood, etc.  at a house party i held in the mid 2000s a guy shows up who i didn&#39;t know.  he knew all about me.  he knew my corporation name.  he knew where i had worked.  everything.  he told me about pizzagate, about trump being elected, about ww3 with nk.   he told me about all of my future social media account names.  and he told me my dad was involved in this child trafficking thing.  </p>

<p>having had many people come up to me thru my life and telling me about my future with exact precision i basically shut down and ignored it when people would do this, which was often enough.  so that was how i coped with it.  i felt i was being groomed for a role and i didn&#39;t know who to trust.  still don&#39;t really.</p>

<p>fast forward to now.  i reconnected with my dad last year.  i go to his place in the country.  it&#39;s a farm type place, 188 acres, in pontypool ontario.  very isolated.  no visibility from the road.  next to a railroad track where the trains run at about 5kph.  so very slow.  along the rail track there are no dig signs.  but this is weird since the track in on a berm with gullies beside it and there&#39;s nothing to dig there anyway. weird that they would have signs.  in the new place he had built there was a bug problem.  they would come up from the vents.  i was told it had been going on for years.  i studied this stuff in uni and that&#39;s a closed system.  hvac systems are closed.  if there were organic matter rotting in them it would quickly rot out or dry up.  you wouldn&#39;t have bugs.  so that was one sign.  also i&#39;d do my laundry there.  and in the laundry i&#39;d see small shirts - child sized.  but there were no kids around.  and in the period between visits nobody was there.  on of the shirts i thought was my sisters so i put it on her bed, and she was like what&#39;s this.  i said, it&#39;s from the laundry i thought it was yours.  no, it wasn&#39;t.  that was weird.  there are no small kids around where do these shirts come from.  on subsequent visits i&#39;d see other clothes that didn&#39;t make sense and didn&#39;t seem to belong to anybody.  finally my dad would say things that indicated he had knowledge that he shouldn&#39;t have had about me.  here&#39;s the thing - one of the strategies i had developed to out people who were not what they said they were would be to put out false data and see who would bite on it.  this worked very well actually and helped me spot the degree of unwanted attention i was getting.  my dad was one of the people who bit on the false data.  so something was up there.  so anyway what this person had told me about my dad was validated by the things i was finding.  also there&#39;s a septic bed for the house that&#39;s waaaay too big for the load.  it frankly looks like there&#39;s an underground structure there.  also nearby the farm is a private airport.  basically the property is located in a place that would be ideal for human trafficking if you were to do it underground.  also, i&#39;d drop funny comments while chatting with him and his family to see their reaction.  sure enough, they&#39;d bite on them, and give me feedback that indicated they could see thru the ambiguity of the things i would say.  another incident we&#39;re at a farmers market and there&#39;s a little kid.  i watched my dad&#39;s response to seeing the kid.  it was predatory for lack of a better word.  also in a neighbouring town where we would go for breakfast i&#39;d watch the reactions of the locals to my dad.  some of them just stared at him.  like they knew something was up.  and not good stares - there was tangible malintent.  these are the sort of things that were filling in the gaps.  i suspect there&#39;s a fairly significant human trafficking operation going on in pontypool and it&#39;s not just at his location, but many are involved and it&#39;s known in the community amongst certain members.  that&#39;s what it seems like anyway.  of course there&#39;s no solid evidence to take to the authorities, not that they would listen if i did.  there was a guy kevin annett who started exposing the native abuse scandals in canada and he had life ruined and became a targetted individual.  this despite corroborating claims by several people of the locations and activities that he was breaking.  and no investigation happened.  so it&#39;s that deep in the systems here.  these things are just not investigated.  </p>

That said, there are a few troubling parts of your story that if true, are certainly red flags (past visits by strangers accusing your father &amp; childrens&#39; clothing in his home)</p>

<p>Have you ever thought to talk to your dad about these observations?  If you are posting about this on reddit and he is really involved in such an operation, chances are they are already monitoring your internet traffic and your dad has seen your posts.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the story and article, they were very interesting. I don&#39;t usually post in conspiracy because I don&#39;t want people knowing I get my news here. Just kidding. Kind of. Anyway, I&#39;ve had experiences like you have which I get rid of with supplements. I&#39;ve been a little worried about all the emf type junk, so maybe a vest is in order :).</p>

<p>But, my mom was just diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is that thing that kills the young athletes, also known as sudden death syndrome or something like that. The doctor says that her children have a 50% chance of having it. Anyway, 2 weeks ago I would have blamed my palpitations on those microwave towers, but now I think maybe I&#39;ll handle it with orthomolecular supplementation. Just throwing it out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i eat pretty well and i&#39;m relatively healthy.  this phenomenon i talk about is not a health problem.  and i can discern this because when i move away physically from where the events happen the symptoms disappear.  it&#39;s very consistent.</p>

I have experienced similar attacks and I discovered the best line of defense is to allow the love and light of Jesus Christ to fill my heart. When your heart is full of the grace and mercy of Jesus there is no room for evil to gain a foothold. Pray for the armor of God. Pray for the wisdom of God and follow it to the best of your ability. I will pray for you and I hope you find peace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no wifi here.</p>

<p>re: my dad.  ok so here&#39;s the story.  we were estranged for 25 years or so.  difficult childhood, etc.  at a house party i held in the mid 2000s a guy shows up who i didn&#39;t know.  he knew all about me.  he knew my corporation name.  he knew where i had worked.  everything.  he told me about pizzagate, about trump being elected, about ww3 with nk.   he told me about all of my future social media account names.  and he told me my dad was involved in this child trafficking thing.  </p>

<p>having had many people come up to me thru my life and telling me about my future with exact precision i basically shut down and ignored it when people would do this, which was often enough.  so that was how i coped with it.  i felt i was being groomed for a role and i didn&#39;t know who to trust.  still don&#39;t really.</p>

<p>fast forward to now.  i reconnected with my dad last year.  i go to his place in the country.  it&#39;s a farm type place, 188 acres, in pontypool ontario.  very isolated.  no visibility from the road.  next to a railroad track where the trains run at about 5kph.  so very slow.  along the rail track there are no dig signs.  but this is weird since the track in on a berm with gullies beside it and there&#39;s nothing to dig there anyway. weird that they would have signs.  in the new place he had built there was a bug problem.  they would come up from the vents.  i was told it had been going on for years.  i studied this stuff in uni and that&#39;s a closed system.  hvac systems are closed.  if there were organic matter rotting in them it would quickly rot out or dry up.  you wouldn&#39;t have bugs.  so that was one sign.  also i&#39;d do my laundry there.  and in the laundry i&#39;d see small shirts - child sized.  but there were no kids around.  and in the period between visits nobody was there.  on of the shirts i thought was my sisters so i put it on her bed, and she was like what&#39;s this.  i said, it&#39;s from the laundry i thought it was yours.  no, it wasn&#39;t.  that was weird.  there are no small kids around where do these shirts come from.  on subsequent visits i&#39;d see other clothes that didn&#39;t make sense and didn&#39;t seem to belong to anybody.  finally my dad would say things that indicated he had knowledge that he shouldn&#39;t have had about me.  here&#39;s the thing - one of the strategies i had developed to out people who were not what they said they were would be to put out false data and see who would bite on it.  this worked very well actually and helped me spot the degree of unwanted attention i was getting.  my dad was one of the people who bit on the false data.  so something was up there.  so anyway what this person had told me about my dad was validated by the things i was finding.  also there&#39;s a septic bed for the house that&#39;s waaaay too big for the load.  it frankly looks like there&#39;s an underground structure there.  also nearby the farm is a private airport.  basically the property is located in a place that would be ideal for human trafficking if you were to do it underground.  also, i&#39;d drop funny comments while chatting with him and his family to see their reaction.  sure enough, they&#39;d bite on them, and give me feedback that indicated they could see thru the ambiguity of the things i would say.  another incident we&#39;re at a farmers market and there&#39;s a little kid.  i watched my dad&#39;s response to seeing the kid.  it was predatory for lack of a better word.  also in a neighbouring town where we would go for breakfast i&#39;d watch the reactions of the locals to my dad.  some of them just stared at him.  like they knew something was up.  and not good stares - there was tangible malintent.  these are the sort of things that were filling in the gaps.  i suspect there&#39;s a fairly significant human trafficking operation going on in pontypool and it&#39;s not just at his location, but many are involved and it&#39;s known in the community amongst certain members.  that&#39;s what it seems like anyway.  of course there&#39;s no solid evidence to take to the authorities, not that they would listen if i did.  there was a guy kevin annett who started exposing the native abuse scandals in canada and he had life ruined and became a targetted individual.  this despite corroborating claims by several people of the locations and activities that he was breaking.  and no investigation happened.  so it&#39;s that deep in the systems here.  these things are just not investigated.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s interesting how dismissive your response is.  qualified to self diagnose?  i&#39;m qualified to be rational.  i&#39;m qualified to examine the evidence and to eliminate the impossible or unlikely.  putting faith in others is just not something i do - it&#39;s Bad Design, and i could on for a while on why.  suffice it to say that authority is Bad Design.  you may disagree with this, but there&#39;s ample evidence of the failures of this design pattern that manifest in the same modalities.  so i guess we&#39;ll disagree on this.  i don&#39;t need others, who don&#39;t have the experiences, who aren&#39;t there to come to absolute conclusions about things they don&#39;t have direct experience of.</p>

<p>as to rational people and tinfoil vests.  i posted a link about the use of microwave tech.  this is known tech.  i&#39;m not making it up or inventing it out of thin air.  the application of this tech exists.  and it can create electrical and magnetic phenomenon.  so if that happens, you channel the energy with conductive material.  this is not that complicated and people have used similar things (ie. faraday cages) for the same effect.  by saying rational people don&#39;t do certain things you&#39;re applying a bias that frankly doesn&#39;t address the modality of how this tech would work.  </p>
