        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After reading the 300+ pages of affidavits, as well as going over comments on here, I figured it may be helpful to have a list of info all in one place. I tried to keep the stuff we already knew off the list (wire transfer, player&#39;s club card, etc.). I did include the extras I had on the apartment complex which is not in the affidavits.</p>

<p>Here you go:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Paddock’s email address, <a href="mailto:centralpark1@live.com">centralpark1@live.com</a>, was associated with a previously owned apartment building located in Mesquite, TX. The unknown correspondent (possibly Paddock), <a href="mailto:centralpark4804@gmail.com">centralpark4804@gmail.com</a>, also appears to be linked to the building.</p></li>
<li><p>Paddock purchased Central Park Apartments (CPA) located at 4804 Via Ventura in 2004 for approx. $8 million. The building was sold for a loss in 2012 for $5-6 million. This explains the origin of the email addresses listed above. </p></li>
<li><p>Despite the fact CPA was sold in 2012, both email addresses were still active and in use 5 years later.</p></li>
<li><p>Ownership records for CPA are registered to a HOUSE in Henderson, NV solely owned by someone named Connie (aka Kay) McCain. It is not known how she is related to Paddock or CPA. But, it’s possible she also had an email address associated with the complex. Records can be seen here: <a href="http://www.dallascad.org/AcctHistory.aspx?ID=381527200A0020000">http://www.dallascad.org/AcctHistory.aspx?ID=381527200A0020000</a></p></li>
<li><p>On July 6, 2017 the following correspondence took place between <a href="mailto:centralpark4804@gmail.com">centralpark4804@gmail.com</a> &amp; <a href="mailto:centralpark1@live.com">centralpark1@live.com</a>: </p>

<p>CP1:   try an ar before u buy. we have huge selection. located in the las vegas area.</p>

<p>CP4804:  we have a wide variety of optics and ammunition to try</p>

<p>CP1:   for a thrill try out bumpfire ar’s with 100s of ammunition  </p></li>
<li><p>Paddock purchased a substantial amount of firearms and accessories out of state or online.</p></li>
<li><p>MariLou Danley’s email address was <a href="mailto:marilouroses@live.com">marilouroses@live.com</a>. Both email addresses were registered to Microsoft (live.com). </p></li>
<li><p>Danley “spontaneously” admitted her fingerprints would be on the ammunition USED DURING THE ATTACK. Her DNA was also collected.</p></li>
<li><p>Found in the hotel suite were:    range finding devices, suitcases pre-loaded with high capacity ammo, a set of body armor, an apparent homemade gas mask and glass cutters. </p></li>
<li><p>Paddock had at least one pre-paid cell phone (in the room). They found three phones total: two which were unlocked and contained nothing of note. The third was locked.</p></li>
<li><p>Paddock’s Instagram account: stephenpaddock47. Danley appeared to have FOUR: Mariloudanley, Mariloudanleyy, Mariloudanleypaddock and marilou.danley. </p></li>
<li><p>Danley’s F/B page (marilou.danley) settings were altered at 12:30am on October 2. She deleted it at 2:46am. Apparently, Paddock&#39;s name was not released to the public for another hour. Which means, Danley most likely knew Paddock was involved in one way or another. </p></li>
<li><p>Paddock purchased an EOTech 512.A65 Tactical Holographic firearm accessory on Amazon on September 7, 2017.</p></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. That&#39;s the report I was referencing. But, I could only find that one story. No others to back up the 7 cell phones. And, I didn&#39;t see that ANYWHERE in the documents (which is where they say they found that). I&#39;m just wondering if someone else caught it. Otherwise, I think they&#39;re mistaken. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I keep wondering about. SlipperySix suggests maybe Paddock realized he was screwed in this deal, but shooting out the concert just seems like an outcome nobody would ever come to. I wonder about the logistics -- multiple guys in a room, a tense situation ensues, then one guy starts shooting not the other guys but a crowd across the street, and everyone else stands by. Just an odd scenario to imagine</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s say Paddock works for FBI or CIA or someone and if it is a gun deal gone bad then that agency has to cover their tracks. So they decide to spur of the moment shoot up the festival and make Paddock look like a &quot;lone wolf nut job&quot; and they think no one will question it, because these shootings happen all the time. </p>

<p>Are you talking about the Central Park apartments? If I&#39;m not mistaken, he bought it back in 2004. If that&#39;s an error please let me know so I can fix it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I meant 2004. Unfortunately, I did not have affiliation with the company when it went down. I have only heard about it after we were contacted by the FBI which was right before his name was released. I have not seen any of the paperwork on file regarding the sale so I don’t know if I have anything of value to give. Everyone was pretty freaked out and this topic is taken pretty seriously. I just know what I have heard from the two that primarily dealt with him during the sale process, and that everything seemed normal at the time. There were no red flags during the time of purchase from what the firm was privy to. Extraneous finances, if there were any, I cannot speak to. </p>

<p>I do remember the day this came to light I found it really odd he owned property in 2 towns by the same name. Everyone on this sub later that night kept dismissing that fact as a misconception, that people were getting the cities confused, but I knew that was not the case. What I wonder, is there any foreseeable reason why someone might intentionally live and own property in two cities by the same name but in different states? Perhaps there is a reason for this, but perhaps it was just chance. </p>

<p>The whole thing is very odd, I do know that. People at the office were very freaked by this. They had no idea, as I am sure was the case for many people who knew him loosely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of what I know about it is from the man who dealt with him during the sale had to say. I have not pulled out the file. This firm does not do shady business, I can say that. At the time, the investment was sound and logical.

There might be more to consider there, like what you mentioned. </p>

<p>I’m sorry I don’t know more about it. The guy who dealt with Paddock has been pretty hushed about it, which makes sense with him having to deal with the FBI and it being his business and all. But he did say he was shocked, that the guy seemed perfectly normal and his finances seemed to be in good order. No red flags from what he said. </p>

<p>Paddock and the event are definitely off. We are being lied to about some stuff. And I wonder how strait his finances actually were in reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Multifamily prices are influenced more by rental income and the gross rent multiplier, so I find it very odd the property dropped in value so much unless he did absolutely 0 maintenance/management. I would assume prices would have stabilized by 2012 when he did take a loss on the building vs when he bought it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is true. But it also depends on the area and how greatly it was impacted at the time... which is something I am going to look at tomorrow. Some areas recovered quicker than others. And some people never fully recovered their loss in property value, regardless of area. One thing that comes to mind about loss of value, just because I have seen the issue before with another property, is if the building was constructed using “Chinese drywall” which was a cheap sub par drywall that causes residents to become ill. Perhaps that could be the issue here, it needing replacing. But it’s been a few months since I heard the details of the property. I can’t recall if I ever heard when it was built. </p>

<p>With so much weird stuff around and about Paddock, I think it’s something that should be further looked into for sure. I do know the FBI looked into it, but lord knows we aren’t going to hear about it from them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great job.  Wanted to go over the real estate transaction.  I&#39;m not familiar with all the records, but generally, the tax value is reset to the sale price when a sale takes place.  This happened in the 2004/2005 timeframe when the appraised (taxable) value was reset to $6 million.  This seems indicative of a sale of the property for $6 million.  As the only sale was in 2004 (to Paddock), it seems like he bought it for $6 million.  </p>

<p>The next time there is an abrupt change in the appraised value is 2013 -- which corresponds with the 11/21/2012 sale of the property.   There is price is $7,300,000.  It appears that Paddock sold for $7.3 million.  This gives a &quot;profit&quot; of $1.3 million from the transaction. </p>

<p>Not saying your numbers are wrong, but I can&#39;t follow how you arrived at them and when I look at the appraised value, I get different numbers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Texas and California make things more difficult in regard to finding deeds and property records. The auditor websites are set up differently. So, I was unable to find the deed for both sales. My numbers are based on the article below: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lasvegas-shooting-money/las-vegas-shooter-used-real-estate-investments-to-fund-gambling-guns-idUSKBN1CC00W">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lasvegas-shooting-money/las-vegas-shooter-used-real-estate-investments-to-fund-gambling-guns-idUSKBN1CC00W</a></p>

<p>Actually, after re-reading the article, it appeared he sold it for 9.45 million. I corrected it on my list. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I also added the link to McCain&#39;s home records. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually been digging a little deeper into the properties he owned and his known associates. It&#39;s taken me quite awhile. I wasn&#39;t sure if any of it would even go anywhere. Turns out the CPA property is relevant to the case! Even if this lady has nothing to do with any of this, I still feel like my work hasn&#39;t been for nothing. </p>

<p>Thanks again. And, BTW... I&#39;ve been trying to figure out the tax value on those records as well (my husband and I are looking for a house so it&#39;s helpful). I don&#39;t truly understand it but a guy (I think on this thread) said he would be willing to answer some questions for me. </p>

<p>I think anon has it right, whether or not it was a guess, or inside info, no idea. But the only time there are so many inconsistencies, is when some incompetent government agency is involved.</p>
