<p>Look directly at the sun when it is setting!</p>

<p>It is not harmful.</p>

<p>It is healthy.</p>

<p>This information IS being suppressed.</p>

<p>DO NOT look at the sun when it is overhead.</p>

<p>DO NOT look at the sun when it is an hour past sun rise.</p>

<p>Doing so IS harmful.</p>

<p>There ARE people who DO NOT want you to know about the health benefits of watching the sun.</p>

<p>It IS healthy.</p>

<p>Your body WILL benefit.</p>

<p>Your mind WILL benefit.</p>

<p>The sun is our source of life. </p>

<p>It has as much power to heal as it does to harm.</p>

<p>People will comment below saying it is harmful to watch the sun no matter what.</p>

<p>DO NOT listen to them. </p>

<p>They are either are mis-informed, or want to mis-inform you.</p>

<p>You will have more energy, clearer thoughts, and will be much happier overall by watching the sun.</p>

<p>What does one have to gain by typing this message?</p>

<p>Nothing other than a happier, healthier society.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7q9a0b/looking_at_the_sun_is_good_for_you/">Here is my previous post that was removed for a rule 10 violation.</a></p>

<p>I do not see how a post explaining the benefits of watching the sun can be construed as an accusatory post, however I must contest this is in the most politest of fashions, or risk being accused of attacking this sub, and have my post removed again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are certain points of the day, like you highlight, when looking at the sun is perfectly fine. The haze of the atmosphere scatters much of the direct light and makes it so that it is more orangish in color and much softer on the eyes. I always find something quite peaceful about being up just before dawn. The wind always seems to blow, just as the sun peeks over the horizon, and in an instant darkness turns to light, and a new day dawns. I think there are a lot of psychological benefits to being up just before dawn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you’re actually just spamming this now?</p>

<p>You are telling people to look directly into the sun. Hey he name of this practice is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungazing">sungazing</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently you haven&#39;t looked into vitamin D synthesis and how it works. You don&#39;t need to have your eyes open, since the vitamin D is synthesized in the skin. There is a point between your eyes where it is absorbed readily, which is why I said to face the sun, but even just laying in the sun will still confer the same benefits.</p>

<p>This is a dangerous practice with no real benefits. The sun has been in the sky forever, and if it actually worked there has been plenty of time for its proponents to conduct controlled experiments proving its efficacy.</p>

<p>Also, the often referenced NASA study doesn’t exist. That was a lie.</p>

<p>Be careful if you decide to do this. You could end up ruining your vision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So when I sungaze for 5-10 minutes in the morning as the sun rises and it makes my head and body feel great I&#39;m supposed to believe that it is bad for me? I notice that once the sun is fully above the horizon it starts getting too bright so I stop. Am I supposed to believe that my body can&#39;t tell what is and isn&#39;t harming me? If you have some studies where they have looked at long terms effects of this practice then I&#39;d like to see them. Otherwise I&#39;ll keep doing it because it seems to have nice effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would just like to point out that the logic used in this comment is rife with error. How can you claim that watching the sun is the &quot;devils temptation&quot; as that implies it is blatantly attractive and has obvious benefits, when you also say that it is dangerous with no benefits. I also love how you bring up a NASA article, and then proceed to say its all a lie. Nice straw-man argument. Get truth, man. You need it.</p>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-2" data-depth="2" data-id="dsqjvl6">

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I was being facetious with the devils temptation comment. I figured maybe someone who would disregard evidence (or lack thereof) might respond to a comment about the devil.</p>

<p>And yeah, I brought up the NASA article to point out that it doesn&#39;t actually exist and yet it is commonly touted. Look around at sungazing proponents and they always say it was &quot;verified by nasa&quot; or something, when no such verification has taken place.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m mistaken though. All I know is I saw the NASA thing, looked around for any article actually from NASA, and none appears to exist.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t a straw man either. Even though you didn&#39;t personally mention NASA in this post, just about any literature you can find on sungazing mentions the NASA thing. Anyone looking into this practice is bound to find the claims of a NASA verification, when no such thing exists. I figured I&#39;d save people the time of looking for it like I did when it will no doubt be impossible to find.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://guardianlv.com/2013/05/nasa-confirms-super-human-abilities-gained/">http://guardianlv.com/2013/05/nasa-confirms-super-human-abilities-gained/</a></li>

</ul>

<p>There&#39;s even a book about it lol. I can only assume this misconception stems from some coincidental phrasing on NASA&#39;s part:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_588.html">https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_588.html</a></li>
