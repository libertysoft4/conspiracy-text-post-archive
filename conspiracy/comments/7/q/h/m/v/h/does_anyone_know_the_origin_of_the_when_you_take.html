<p>I wonder where it comes from. Seems like one of these psyops to me, perhaps similar to what was posted about the attempt to discredit &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t mind people criticizing something or not liking it. But when you talk to 100 people and every single one of them brings up the exact same argument with the exact same words ... something&#39;s up, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it might have its origins in some of the mythos surrounding the CIA experiments. There was an incident when they dosed an entire French hamlet in the 50&#39;s w/o their knowledge and there was something like a dozen deaths. If someone doesn&#39;t know they are on LSD and start tripping...they could honestly snap mentally, or at least think they have. I&#39;ve never had a bad experience but I know that if I was unknowingly dosed and didn&#39;t know what tripping was...I would panic. And panic only plays into the LSD even more. Once you are in a bad trip, and don&#39;t know that you are, and also don&#39;t know how to get out, and the whole town is flipping shit and tripping balls...you&#39;ve got a recipe for trouble and danger.</p>

<p>I agree. Never having been on LSD and suddenly being plunged into that world out of nowhere ... that must be pretty horrible and confusing. I&#39;m also glad you said &quot;think they have&quot; because that&#39;s what it comes down to I think. If they survive long enough and realize what actually happened, I think they&#39;re likely to recover without too much of a problem, unless it somehow made them aware of some repressed trauma. (which happened to me)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truly terrifying. And I think you make a good point about repressed memories. That&#39;s always something I advise first-timers. Make sure you have dealt with your demons, or are at least at peace with them, because the LSD <em>will</em> make you confront anything you&#39;ve buried within yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, easier said than done. Before taking psychedelics I didn&#39;t even remotely imagine I actually HAD demons. Think of that. So while I&#39;ve had trips that make bad trips look like a walk in the park ... at least it made me aware there was stuff I&#39;ve yet to deal with.</p>

<p>The ironic thing is that a few times on LSD, I just surrendered and everything was okay while the trip lasted, but as the effects wore off, it became bad again. Though in hindsight, it&#39;s possible that the &quot;surrender&quot; was actually just me giving in to some defense mechanism. Not entirely sure, have not figured that mystery out as of yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a weird drug for sure. Definitely a lot of fun, but not something I recommend anyone take lightly. You make a good point that not everyone will <em>know</em> there are things they have to confront, but that&#39;s also one of the &quot;perks&quot; I suppose of LSD. It will show you what is really going on up there. </p>

<p>And the point about surrender and the issues getting worse as the LSD wore off is also something I&#39;ve thought about, though in a different way. I explain it to people that when you trip on LSD, you don&#39;t want to do it every day. It changes you as a person, even just one trip. But this can be for the better. It&#39;s not good to trip constantly, because you aren&#39;t able to essentially &quot;come down&quot;, and bring what you learned while on LSD back to apply to practical reality. Even if that means your own observations of your personal demons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair though, I don&#39;t feel like LSD is something you can get addicted to. I&#39;ve never felt the urge to take another dose just after the first one wore off. Felt more like I wanted to process what I&#39;ve seen for a week or two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same for me on both counts. But I have known a couple of people that have tried the whole &quot;tripping every day&quot; thing. It definitely changed them...they end up in a state where they never quite seem &quot;themselves&quot; anymore. Even though they aren&#39;t chemically tripping in their brain, they are permanently locked within that sort of tripping mentality. Which I don&#39;t think is useful or good for the long term.</p>

<p>Snopes is a shit website.  People do stupid shit on acid because acid is a powerful drug.  The more you take the more powerful it is and its pretty much impossible to tell how strong of a dose you have in your hand.  </p>

<p>One hit of acid, typically on a tiny square of blotter paper could actually be 4 hits of acid on the same size paper, or it could just be a piece of paper with no LSD on it at all.  </p>

<p>The problem is that you have people making this shit and some of them are good chemists and others not so much.  Some know how to properly measure a dose and some don&#39;t.  Some care about the drug and the experience and the customer. Some just want to make money like a heroin dealer.</p>

<p>The one girl snopes is talking about is one story they could call into question or debunk.  Anyone who has been around people doing LSD or who has done it themselves for a significant (beyond initial experimentation) knows that people&#39;s minds are easily pushed into insanity.  All it takes is a super stressful situation or a bad hit of acid to send you WAAAAAAY over the edge.  Its important that you don&#39;t drop a couple hits of acid for your first time when you know your going to be in a crowded situation with no hope of retreat.  I&#39;m not saying that going to Las Vegas on acid is always an awful idea but you better damn well know what you&#39;re getting into before you try that stunt.</p>

<p>Furthermore I feel like mushrooms are much safer and they certainly are more forgiving if you eat too much.  My personal advice would be stay the fuck away from LSD and if you want an experience in that realm, Do mushrooms because they are easier on your mind or do DMT because it doesn&#39;t last for hours on end.</p>

<p>Going on a trip is strange thing.  One time you might love it and never want it to end, the next time you might spend the night praying for it all to be over.  </p>

<p>Enter with caution, tread lightly and don&#39;t wing it until you understand the drug.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mushrooms are not safer, there is now way (unless your a chemist) to know the strength of the trip, I&#39;ve had a mate who has had acid a good few times, tried mushrooms and the trip was way more intense. Needless to say he hasn&#39;t taken mushrooms again.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to know a safer way to try acid without taking any smoke some salvia divinorum, get the strongest you can and smoke it pure through a pipe, it&#39;s 100% legal and only lasts 10 minutes and is the closest you&#39;ll get to tripping without taking acid or mushrooms. If you do, make sure you have a friend with you. It only lasts 10 mins but it&#39;s an experience!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but I think this is bad advice and no one should listen to it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve done mushrooms many times and never had anything but a spectacularly awesome time. Everyone should do mushrooms.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done acid a bunch of times and had one time where I wasn&#39;t in a terrific place for a brief time, maybe an hour or two, and the rest was pretty great. Every other trip, I had an awesome time as well pretty much start to finish.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched videos of people on salvia and read about it and it seems like it&#39;s way too easy to do too much, and apparently some people can experience a break from reality they never fully recover from. I would never even think about trying this shit. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re nervous about this stuff, do half a gram of shrooms and take it from there. </p>

Over time though, it kind of just became about those people who would actually try to fly for whatever dumb reason they were influenced by. Reminds me of a meme lol.</p>

<p>Our brains are very good at filtering out too much information, presented with a chemical which prevents that from happening your brain tries to make sense of the incomming information, and much like dreaming it just fills in the gaps.</p>

<p>The idea that you can fly, that you are able to lift off is entirely plausible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mind-altering drugs can make a person confused and scared. A bad trip on a potent dose of a powerful hallucinogen could absolutely lead a person to becoming confused and doing something like jumping off of a building. Confusion and fear combined with delusions and hallucinations can lead a person to kill themselves even if they wouldn&#39;t have intended to if sober. This possibility for a bad experience is why people who do hallucinogens usually advocate using a &quot;trip sitter&quot;, someone trustworthy who can watch over and make sure the person tripping doesn&#39;t do anything dangerous or destructive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend once took 7 grams of dried pyschedellic mushrooms.  Normal is 2-3 grams a trip.  He was soo out of it he tried jumping off his balcony and his buddy had to hold him down from jumping.  Afterwards he said 7 grams at once was a horrible idea.  </p>

<p>It depends on the person.  I had another friend who would turn into a three year old and just sit down where ever she was.  I had to hold her hand and guide her on where to go.  If I stopped she would just sit down.</p>

<p>TL;DR Plausible if a ludicrous amount is taken.  Like 10-20 hits maybe?  Rather than one to three.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It almost certainly originated from the death of Frank Olson, who allegedly &quot;jumped&quot; or &quot;fell&quot; out of a window a few days after being surreptitiously fed LSD by the CIA.  </p>

<p>There are so many levels of disinfo here though. First, there&#39;s never been another documented case of someone jumping out of a window while on LSD because they thought they could fly. It&#39;s just good anti-LSD propaganda. Second, it&#39;s likely now that Frank Olson was never even dosed with LSD, and instead the CIA made that up because it was a better story than what really happened (which is pretty alarming, that the CIA thought that admitting they had secretly dosed an American citizen with LSD, resulting in his death, was <em>better</em> for the CIA than telling the truth).  </p>
