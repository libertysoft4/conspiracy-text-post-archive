The brigaded top comments all have one thing in common - they&#39;re incredibly insulting, disgusting, and extreme. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve created a joke out of real criminal conspiracies. We want answers regarding Haiti, human trafficking, state-sponsored terror - they want to talk about a failing Russian lie and piss tapes. They don&#39;t have any interest in exposing injustice, they just want political control, they just want to control the narrative no matter how twisted, how bogus. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not mad Trump is being attacked and lied about - I&#39;m mad that you&#39;ve degraded noble pursuits, the desire to expose injustices, and people with consciences that don&#39;t want to see evil people get away with truly heinous crimes. </p>

<p>If they can&#39;t keep you in line, if they can&#39;t keep you under their spell, they&#39;ll insult you, harass you, intimidate you, and if all else fails, they will hurt you and eventually kill you.</p>

<p>Of course I have a side and narrative, and it&#39;s pretty clear ours has far more credibility than the shit the other side&#39;s pushing. And I&#39;m not talking left vs right (even though a lot of the left is misguided), I&#39;m talking about just good people vs a global, criminal cabal.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh you finally responded, wasn&#39;t that easy? If you just answered we could&#39;ve avoided your embarrassing mess of a mind up there.</p>

<p>Okay, disabled reporter: Trump was mocking his inability to remember what he wrote, implying he is only &quot;mis-remembering&quot; as a way to discredit Trump. He did in fact write what Trump quoted him as writing so his reason for defending himself is justified. He&#39;s also mocked himself in the same way, limp-wrists, open mouth, tongue out, on video. Remember, this is why he brought the reporter up, and this is what he says. It&#39;s literally unprovable he did it to mock his disability.</p>

<p>If he insults you, he&#39;s responding to something you did or said. He&#39;s justified to defend himself, it&#39;s not his fault if you&#39;re hurt by your own insecurity. Trump makes fun of Rosie O&#39;Donnel for being a fat pig, Rubio for being short, Jeb for being a cuck. It&#39;s like a bee wondering why it got squished when it repeatedly stings a bear.</p>

<p>But yes, the fee-fees, they hurt. It&#39;s totally not picking on the president when they call his hands small, his skin orange, his wife a whore, and execute a fake-Trump in a music video, right? Totally no double-standards going on. These are totally the important issues though right, I&#39;m glad that the left can continue to push their phony-outrage so they can look good when virtue-signaling. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t talk about the left and double standards when you had shit like that from the right.</p>

<p>You say you aren&#39;t left vs right, but all you are doing is attacking the left. You aren&#39;t fooling anyone except yourself which does seem easy to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This culture is neck deep in propping up war criminals and corruption.   No politicians are calling for accountability,   but the news cycle needs daily meet,   the circus must go on,  and the only people willing to put their face on this are bad people whose competence has nothing to do with fixing any of this.    Its far beyond fixing at this point,   but what we DO have is a community here on r/conspiracy that is substantially interested in bringing out the truth.    That&#39;s not going to win a popularity contest in times like this.    Outside of the small community that want to expose deeper levels of reality,  most people want to grind a particular axe to continue a way of life they hope to preserve or attain.    Which is getting harder and harder.    So,   lots of anger and frustration.</p>

<p>Check this out. I didn&#39;t create this graph, I found it in one of the many posts complaining about T_D users brigading, but it actually shows the opposite.  In the plot of T_D vs non-T_D, you will see that future T_D users were here, getting upvoted, before Trump ever decided to run for President, and before T_D was even created.  You will also see that T_D users were not in here downvoting everyone.  There is no divergence.  T_D users spike, and non-T_D users also spike.  That changes after the election.  T_D users scores drop significantly while non-T_D user scores rise.  This is evidence of significant vote brigading.  The index line makes it even more obvious.  After the election there is a massive drop in average comment scores.  Non-stop brigading.</p>

<p>The Dem Party just mysteriously had tens of thousands of its young voters purged from their rolls the day of the Primary, then their names showed up again in time for the GE? You see how that is bullshit right? You are also aware that NY and especially NYC are parts of a massive Dem Party machine, right? That defense is ridiculous.

<p>It means that the DNC never considered anyone else. It also means that HRC controlled not only the money but the apparatus and the bureaucracy of the DNC from the get go. No challenger ever had a chance. Cheating.</p>

<p>Bernie got that much support, and would have beater her pathetic campaign if they hadn&#39;t slanted the field against him for all the reasons I stated above. The purge didn&#39;t effect her, it was a closed Primary and selectively purged voters in Brooklyn, where Bernie was born, and other boroughs he polled well in, were dropped from the rolls. Many of them millennials. It definitely hurt him far, far more than her. </p>

<p>In a city and state controlled by Dems. They knew what they were doing, it&#39;s literally impossible that they didn&#39;t. But keep pretending the state is completely divorced from the Party that controls it. LMFAO.</p>

<p>Lol nope. How convenient for the reality that HRC cheated. </p>

<p>In anticipations of HRC being the only serious one to run, all to help her with her hand-picked plant in the DNC DWS who had to resign in disgrace for her part in all this.</p>

<p>Nope, your debunking is super weak and wrong tho. But keep defending the Corporatists who have destroyed the Dem Party and turned it into something FDR wouldn&#39;t recognize. HRC is a disgrace to the memory of the New Deal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All animosity aside, it hurts when you lose an election. I&#39;ve been gut punched several times in elections. I love Bernie too but i can&#39;t get caught up in the division when i see what the right wing is doing to america: starve the beast, killing safety regulations, killing EPA, FSA, USDA, tax cuts income inequality and hell now they wanna roll back pot legalization...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been watching them wallow in racism and xenophobia while catering to corporations since 80s and i can&#39;t in good conscience attack Dems knowing what we have ahead of us.</p>

<p>Every damn time with this shit. Anyone who doesn&#39;t blindly support the Corporatists must be Trumpers? Why?</p>

<p>We need to change the Party <em>now</em>. It doesn&#39;t matter if Trump loses and a Corporatist like Kamala or Deval wins. They will continue looting the country but do it under the table, like the rest of the Corporatists have done for decades. The Dems are corrupt, and without seizing the Party and returning it to its New Deal roots we won&#39;t save this country. It will continue on its path to destruction.</p>

<p>We need to destroy the Corporatist choke hold on the Party and make sure it is seized by <em>real</em> Progressives. This is the only way we save the Republic. Destroy the donor class, eliminate K street and its hold on the Party, eliminate Citizens United and don&#39;t accept Presidential candidates who take donations from the Pharmaceutical, Insurance, and other Corporate industries. </p>

<p>The Party must fight its civil war now, for now is the perfect time. The Corporate faction is weak, and what may be our only window to strike and seize the Party has opened since 2016. We must ensure we utilize this opening. This is how we guarantee Single Payer. This is how we guarantee Nationally funded College Education. This is how we return the Party to its New Deal roots.</p>

<p>You&#39;re dead wrong if you think I&#39;m a Trump supporter. </p>

<p>Failing how?  See, this just tells me that you have an agenda as well.  If you are here for the truth then one of the largest unsolved conspiracy theories of my lifetime is whether Trump, his campaign and Russia colluded.  Why is that off limits to you?

<p>There&#39;s plenty of information the public knows and there is just no convincing evidence of collusion. You want to claim I&#39;m jumping the gun but big names, political figures said from the beginning it was treason and collusion. All that&#39;s come out since then is evidence of criminal conspiracy of framing and spying AGAINST the Trump team and there&#39;s evidence of 10x the collusion between HRC and the Dems with Russia.</p>

<p>If you can believe in the Trump-Russian conspiracy, why can&#39;t you believe Dem-Russian conspiracy? Maybe they&#39;re the ones lying to cover up their own crimes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Russia acted to help trump was it maybe to ward off WW3 via nukes if Hillary got elected? This explanation was circling for a while, given what we know now about Uranium one, the multiple murdered Russian agents after the election as well as a trove of other happenings since then... would you still consider this collusion? </p>

<p>Have you asked yourself what information Russia may have provided the Trump team, what do they currently have that is so damming. </p>

<p>Then again, I still laugh at anyone caught in the &quot;muh Russia&quot; that refuses to look at any other pieces of information. When you do, you realize that Russia posting on social media in a way that favored Trump may be the least of our worries. </p>

<p>To each their own though. I would suggest visiting a sub that dedicates its existence to pushing that story so that you don&#39;t notice anything else. Trust me, there&#39;s many on this website. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And some people want answers regarding Trump, Russia and piss tapes. Why do you think what you want answers to is the only thing people should discuss? How does you not believing something make it not conspiracy worthy here? This sub is open to all forms of conspiracy, not just what you want to discuss. </p>

<p>This sub has major echo chamber qualities to it. Most wont agree, but that&#39;s cause they are knee deep in the echo chamber with other accounts they agree with. There are plenty of people here who keep lists of accounts they agree with and disagree with and base their votes on that. Using RES it is easy to label everyone so there is really no effort to do.</p>

<p>How often do you see a comment like &quot;3 month old account&quot; and it&#39;s cause the person saying it doesn&#39;t agree with the comment someone made. Hell, I&#39;ve actually seen people call it out on accounts that are younger than the account they are saying it to!! Notice how you never see someone go, &quot;Well I agree with you, but your account is only 3 months old...&quot; or they never call out an account age when it&#39;s over a few years old, even if they don&#39;t agree with it. Comments like that serve no purpose and are this subs easy way out of a discussion with people. If you&#39;re all worried about account ages, petition the mods to require accounts to be 1 year old before they can post here. Good luck with that!</p>
