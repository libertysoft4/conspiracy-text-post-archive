    <div class="md"><p>If the elites wanted any significant form of socialism (centrist to left wing economics) then they would have allowed Bernie Sanders to win fair and square. 
Instead, they used multiple methods to rig the primaries against him. Corporate media collusion, shredded ballots, switched party registrations, YUGE waiting lines, colluding DNC/Debbie/Clinton, dead people &quot;voting&quot;, all of the media shitting on Bernie, etc. (Remember Fox News&#39; bullshit 90% tax rate lie....TOP tax rate was actually 52% or something, look it up. And much lower for working/middle class people like me and you. This is why I don&#39;t watch CORPORATE media anymore, it&#39;s filthy propaganda.)</p>

<p>Crony capitalism (Dems and Repubs BOTH push) is not socialism. It&#39;s socialism inverted, aka socialism for the super rich (e.g. our tax money going to big pharma/insurance companies + cronyist favoritist contracts).
The elite never want socialism for the people, only for themselves.</p>

<p>The party system is corrupt, both consisting of extreme right NEOliberals and NSA spy state warmonger authoritarians. Socialism has nothing to do with it. We have the very bare minimum of socialism: roads, schools, police, fire brigade, social security, etc.
It&#39;s how you use taxes that matters....tax is not the same as socialism. Obamacare is a social program but it&#39;s not socialist in any major way, it&#39;s crony capitalist and NEOliberal (big companies deregulated enough to raise prices at will without competition, e.g. cheap Canadian medicine.)</p>

<p>JFK, Jr was never an elected official.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/jfk-jr-mulled-run-senate-2000-article-1.847866">this source from 1999,</a> he considered a run for the seat, but....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea became moot once First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton signaled her interest in running</p>

<p>i.e., the fix was in. The DNC decided who would get that seat and JFK, Jr would have to wait his turn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bc you are basically accepting being a serf and bitch to rich people with trump. He is pushing the ceiling knowing that it lowers the floor. This is what Britain did knowing their empire was over. It cemented the rich at the top to survive and forced the people to be soldiers or servants. That is what&#39;s going on. The market won&#39;t hold, you will get fucked and the rich will stay in power making decisions that guarantee only a .01% of the population escape. Trump is cementing the echelon on your back and bunghole and you&#39;re too stupid to see. After this, people will blame the next president for the collapse. The people will revolt and your dumb ass will join bc its against the fall guy and you&#39;ll feel empowered and you will never know it was ur jack off material trumps fault. </p>

They couldn&#39;t capture all the bodies so They put trump in to g rid of them and to distract they are doing all this bull shit to keep from a class war... Make it race and educated vs non educated in stead of allowing people to see they are living in modern serfdom. The French revolution is about to happen again and its about delaying it and cementing the rich. The same families who survived the revolution still rule areas of France. Trump isn&#39;t dumb, but he def isn&#39;t honest. The Clinton&#39;s already made the purge so it was a favor to trump after trump helped the rich and bill Clinton during the community reinvestment act rewrite in 1996. </p>

<p>Before you dismiss it, consider this additional fact.

It was her second post as a moderator to r/WikiLeaks. Meanwhile, the Black Hole of Fuckery that was the 2016 election continues to suck in more and more of DC.

<p>The most interesting subsequent developments are Kim DotCom&#39;s claim that Seth Rich was a Mega user. (The story that Sy tells on the tape has room in it for Kim DotCom&#39;s earlier claim to have information relevant to Mueller&#39;s investigation; Mega would have seemed at the time to be a good choice for communicating big file sets.)</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be a fan of either Obama or Trump to think they&#39;re not equals. Or at least not equal when it comes to the political world. One was a politician who&#39;d gone to Harvard and studied politics with experience working in his community and the other was a reality TV star who built some buildings after daddy handed him a fortune (who went to Penn only after he could transfer in after a few years of another school, where he actually got in...).</p>

<p>Oprah has never stated her policy positions on many important issues. If someone says that she should be president in spite of this, it&#39;s because they want her to be president for another reason, like her race or gender or wealth or celebrity status. Or just because their corporate propaganda told them to think that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not defending Oprah and don&#39;t want to see her run for presidency, but just because she has never made her overtly political view on certain policies doesn&#39;t mean she hasn&#39;t made her feelings on those <em>topics</em> clear. Especially given that she hosted a talk show almost every day for 22 years.</p>

<p>Just because someone has never told you their take on the legal issue of abortion, for instance, if you hang out with the person regularly and see how they live their values and talk with them about their values, you are probably able to at least generally extrapolate what their take on the political policy would be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, a more accurate comparison to Oprah would not be Trump; it would be Reagan. Both Reagan and Oprah were principally in entertainment.</p>

<p>Trump, while a self-promoter, had some entertainment aspects to his persona; he was primarily a real estate mogul. A businessman.</p>

<p>Trump is vastly closer to FDR than to either Oprah or Reagan. Both Trump and FDR were born rich (unlike Oprah and Reagan). FDR was a businessman first. (He had extensive ties to Wall Street and had eleven directorships at top companies before going into politics. See historian Antony Sutton&#39;s meticulous breakdown of his Wall Street ties.) Once IN politics, he engaged in the &quot;newfangled technology of the day,&quot; radio, and gave fireside chats. Which at the time was said to be vulgar and beneath the dignity of a President.</p>

<p>It was the Twitter of its day.</p>

<p>In summation: No, Trump was not a movie star. Nor was he someone who made his money in media. He made it selling buildings. The dabbling in commercials and Miss Universe were things to spread and promote his brand.</p>

<p>But media was NOT his brand. Real estate was.</p>

<p>Media was merely a means to an end.</p>

<p>For Oprah and Reagan, media was not merely a means to an end. It was their whole job. (They were famous for nothing else).</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: In the end, Oprah will never run. She has too many complications. Like her awkward spinsterhood and swirling questions about her &quot;celibacy&quot;. I mean, who would be the First lady? Her friend Gayle? (Likewise Oprah has too many ties to Hollywood&#39;s pedophile rings and that girl school of hers in Africa, where the children were used for sex slaves.) To say nothing of all the racist comments she made about wanting white people to die out etc. Oprah&#39;s not as &quot;nice&quot; as the Deep State wants us to think she is. Because of all her skeletons, no: The smart money says that she won&#39;t, in the end, want the level of scrutiny that comes with running for President. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>His Nobel Peace Prize was emblematic of the particular strain of brainwashing that had the strongest hold 8 years ago. Thats why fucks are given. History matters. Of course Obama is a better politician than Trump - just surprised a poster in r/conspiracy thinks it wasn&#39;t until Trumps election when &#39;truth&#39; went out the window.</p>

<p>Princeton (Gilens and Page) told us in 2014 that the bottom 90% of earners have a near-zero impact on public policy. Comparing Trump to Obama seems a little silly when we actually don&#39;t have a functioning representative democracy anymore. </p>

<p>And most of the world outside of the US thought to themselves &quot;so i guess they&#39;re just handing them out to anyone now&quot;  </p>

<p>Gotta remember that the people outside the states are not the same as the media, and don&#39;t have the exact opinions about things that the media claim they have, not pc-opinions are either ridiculed or given no media time and attention. So just because european media writes that everyone thinks that Obama shits gold and is the promised one it&#39;s probably not what everyone really thinks, but if anyone writes otherwise they&#39;re going to lose advertisers and who wants to lose money when thats the reason your making newspapers in the first place.</p>

<p>Great truths here.  But just a note.  Any saving grace of our current political state might need an actor that both hasour interests in mind but also stokes the fire using emotional.  Rationality can be dry and slow to stoke the same fire needed for collective action.  Its a technique.  And still a warning sign for sure.  </p>

    <div class="md"><ol>
<li><p>Look at this <a href="http://www.macrotrends.net/1358/dow-jones-industrial-average-last-10-years">10 year DJIA graph</a>. The stock market has been climbing steadily since 2009. The 2016 election caused growth suppression due to uncertainty of the political future. The surge since has been a correction back to the original trajectory (if you draw a best-fit line on that graph, it would intersect with exactly where the market is today).</p></li>
<li><p>I hope the best for the Korean talks, I don&#39;t think anyone would root against this if Trump accomplishes this. What people have a problem with is the reckless means that we&#39;ve gotten there. Wagering nuclear-war on Black at the roulette table, even if you win on black, doesn&#39;t mean it was worth the risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump made some good decisions on this. I&#39;ve give credit where credit is true. I&#39;d argue that ISIS was more an accomplishment of many allies and foes forming a coalition for a common purpose, than a personal victory for Trump. But, his decisions were a part of that so I&#39;m happy to put that one in his win column.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>TL;DR: Trump makes a point of anointing himself as the reason anything good happens these days (e.g. when he took credit for jobs coming back to the US -- even when the companies publicly stated that these were plans already underway long before the election). It is wrong to fall for this trick, and take the victories he claims as fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The nation is run almost entirely by the finance people on wall street.  It&#39;s not hyperbole to say they control nearly the entire nation&#39;s resources.  What goes on in government is a stage show -- literally.  For the most part, the federal government does not exist anymore... it&#39;s only remaining function is to steal money from the electorate and redistribute it to massive corporations (directly and indirectly), and to create an illusion of meaningful political expression and representation.</p>

<p>As time goes on, it&#39;s been obvious to see political discourse come to reflect reality.  Now our politicians will be &#39;reality&#39; television stars and we will debate the merits of their personalities (which were crafted for tv).  This is the new political landscape in America, whether anyone likes of or not.</p>
