They think the military was able to shoot it down, and decided to cover up rather than come out and say it was North Korea, which obviously would lead to US retaliating. Wondering if there is any locals in Hawaii who have heard this or have anything to add?</p>

<p>This is the first thing I thought.</p>

<p>With all the NK and bomb talks recently it&#39;s very intriguing that this &quot;error&quot; happened at such time.</p>

<p>The coincidence is there, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever know if it was in fact some experiment or an honest mistake.</p>
