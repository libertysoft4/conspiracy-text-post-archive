    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a money game. What can they do to distract us/justify their actions while not covering the whole story. Our media is all terror and fear. Every single story is about how a racist did this, or how a terrorist did that, how your mom&#39;s neighbor of 15 years got kidnapped and murdered yesterday, this tiny two year old who froze to death bc the dad was pissy and set her outside then got drunk, how Trump called Haiti and Africa a shit hole, etc etc. </p>

<p>Nothing on how there is true good in the world. Nothing to give us actual hope or spread/promote love and kindness. The most we see are how a community came together to fund the school library but then there are no stories detailing how that school system got so poor, where the initial funding went or how the school is primarily minority and low income and their representatives don&#39;t say/do shit. </p>

<p>It&#39;s literally disinformation. Which I just don&#39;t get. If the people who controlled the media promoted other things than not only would we probably not care/need to look deeper like we are today into their agendas. We&#39;d be a happier, smarter, kinder society. Ahhh but wait. Kindness and love doesn&#39;t = money from the destabilization of other countries or ultimate power. </p>

<p>I still don&#39;t get it man. Why not just do everything in secret, heavily skew anything that could relate the story to you and then still allow your country to flourish. </p>

<p>No one in America reads anymore. No one critically thinks. They watch the news and that&#39;s it. Thats their only source of information. By dumbing us down and creating a state of divide and fear they can keep us distracted while they do their thing. But, generations wake up. They riot and make noise which changes things bc then things /HAVE/ to change. And then the media picks something new to create discord. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we are all constantly stressed, focusing on LGBT rights, racial divides then we can&#39;t really focus on the treatment or global politics bc we only know, see and care about what&#39;s happening to our friends and family. And even then, they promote extremes. </p>

<p>Republicans vs Democrats. Two extremes of the same Country. Why not actually be moderate and make every happy? Why not compromise instead of pushing through the  dumbest, most spiteful legislation let&#39;s say</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, your prolife and don&#39;t want to fund planned parenthood. Let&#39;s allow communities and states to decide the funding and not make it illegal, but those who want, need and support the cause can fund the facilities and use their tax dollars to pay.&quot;</p>

<p>Instead,  it&#39;s either completely defund or federally fund. The states then also need money for other programs that their federal tax dollars are being used for, but now their taxes are being thrown into this program or that across the country to help just one or a few communities. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why there is such a political divide too. We introduce socialistic programs that need reform, and Republicans don&#39;t qualify for the programs and want to better their own community not the ones where minorities can&#39;t even get a job bc they think that it is only furthering a lazy, destabilizing lifestyle. </p>

<p>Then we come to racial divide bc we displaced them, and now their communities are in such danger in heavily Republican controlled states that they can&#39;t get better. So they&#39;re mad that they&#39;re forced into trapping, aspiring to be a rapper or a sport star and don&#39;t really have the resources to go for something better or even have the support to tell them &quot;hey, you can become that CEO.&quot;</p>

<p>SO then they&#39;re stuck. Real Republicans don&#39;t realize their stuck. Democrats fund welfare while not being able to push for federal programs that stabilizes their communities so it&#39;s like &quot;okay you won&#39;t let us help them so now you help us help them for now&quot;</p>

<p>And it goes on and on with every issue here. Abortion. Civil rights. Minority stabilization, immigration, LGBT issues, religious freedom. They&#39;re all so extreme and it all consumes us bc the people in power can&#39;t or won&#39;t settle and come to a fucking agreement. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t even want to look into how and why WWI actually happened or the companies involved. Same with WWII. And every war/proxy war following. Even what and who the former presidents wanted or who they sided with. Who the people are at the top. Who funds who and why.</p>

<p>We have our own shit to focus on like how tf am I working two jobs and still can barely make rent and how my mother is retired from working 65+ years and her SS never went up with inflation so she can&#39;t live on her own. Or how my friend is trans/gay and just yesterday someone in the community was brutally murdered and raped for being trans/gay. </p>

<p>We&#39;re distracted. So fed up, tired and overworked. We just want to go home, get some cheap fast food and watch tv/the news. </p>

Or how terrorism is now used to keep us in the middle east and have people fear immigration from countries WE fucked over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not so much as state, but they&#39;re funded by the same people above them. They&#39;re allowed some freedom, but it&#39;s hard to cover topics when the agenda comes from above. Mainstream media is the norm, but local stations cover different topics. </p>

<p>Republicans states local news are about how hillary is a liar and a crook, the troubles within minority communities, gangs, and industry death killing the communities they&#39;re broadcasting to. The opioid crisis exploding in rural communities and how nothing is being done. And all of the people who tune in and are &#39;republixan&#39; blame all those issues on Democrat snow flakes taking their money and killing their industry. </p>

<p>Democratic local news is more, fuck Trump. Look at him calling these countries a shit hole. Hey we legalized Marijuana and look at how much taxes we&#39;re going to reel in. We focused on clean energy! woo! But, look at these worse off Republican states who need help. But remember guys, they hate gays, blacks, and think the south will rise again.&quot;</p>

<p>Nothing on the real issues behind them that allow clarity. Nothing to explain so that people can link two and two together and figure out how to make an actual change. They don&#39;t really cover the others point of view. Just mock it and make an example out of them to low key further their cause. </p>

<p>Which once again keeps us occupied. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s always about the money. Every time there was bad news about the US invasion of Iraq (2003-2007-ish) there would be a &quot;new&quot; controversy about gay marriage or the abortion debate would crop its head back up into the public debate and distract us from the murder machine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a distraction technique designed to keep the people who are making money to keep making money--to keep their contracts in place. In Iraq, it was the defense contractors who popped up in the thousands to get their no-bid government money. It&#39;s always about the money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government is filled with hundreds of thousands of people, but yes, a few of them have very strong contacts at the top of the networks and within the boardrooms and editorial rooms. And these people in positions of power within our government also get their pushes and prods from the people at the tops of industry. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like everyone who works at (name your station) gets a paycheck from the government, however, the same interests that control our government--namely a handful of industries including banks, defense, energy, pharma and ag, also have controlling stakes in media. </p>

<p>Again, the 2003 invasion of Iraq is illustrative of this: all the major networks were pushing the same narrative in spite of the flimsy evidence of an actual threat from Iraq.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a proven means of control. By dividing the populace with contrived &quot;issues&quot; (like abortion, gun control, stuff that doesn&#39;t have obvious right answers) the elites can more easily remain in control. For example, people are being asked if war with N korea is the right option. People might be divided on this issue, and might have lively debates over how to deal with N Korea. But the fact of the matter is our missile defense can easily deal with their threats, and meanwhile we are continuing wars in afghanistan to fuel the opioid epidemic in our own country and we are still bombing the shit out of yemen. No one talks about these things because the media gives them no air time. Thus they control the discussion and they focus on theings that divide the populace.</p>

<p>Another important point to note is that if there werent such clear dividing lines on issues (which are almost always false dichotomies in the first place), they wouldn&#39;t be able to easily point to the political party that &quot;fits your ideals&quot;. In reality neither the republicans nor the democtrats work in the interest of their constituents, but people are tricked into voting for them because of the false dichotomies perpetuated through the media. Meanwhile, the media only focuses attention to those two parties, acting as if the others might as well not exist. This is only a belief; if people were to vote third parties en masse then no amount of rigging would be able to stop them from being elected. They know this so its of vital importance for the powerful to only present thoroughly vetted and blackmailed candidates for our voting through the controlled two party system. The media thus plays a vital role in the control grid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually don&#39;t think media is as big of a concern as our leaders. Media is not perfect by any stretch, but no one is asking you to watch the news 24/7. And we should be using discernment when we do consume the news because like most everything in the US, it&#39;s a for-profit industry. However, the prospect of leaders telling us what to believe and what not to believe is a terrifying one, and one that has effectively divided us in no time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What don&#39;t they gain, they&#39;ve the ability to pass law that goes largely unnoticed. They use the populace to defeat each other when someone brings issue that is of real concern. </p>

<p>It might not even be a they that gains. It could just be that each individual politician gains independently something. Like a job with nice benefits. Congress does whatever they want, their ethics committee calls people out but there is never any actual reprimands made. All of it is a show, and if we continue to fight with each other we won&#39;t have the time to look towards those that are suppose to be governing this country.</p>

<p>How is that life is this way? Why haven&#39;t things changed significantly with the last 50 years. As a child I had dreams that the world could change. But as you get older you see that everyone pretends that it can&#39;t. That this is the way it is. So we continue to march towards a system that clearly doesn&#39;t care about you or me. We fight each other about the system and make sure that the side we choose is the side that is blinding us the most.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t see that the two sides are on the same fucking line and it doesn&#39;t matter where you stand its all headed to the same place.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t see that the sides are illusionary. That this system we have where taxes are taken from us to help provide a system for society is still full of people optionally donate things to others because some how the system abandon those in need. </p>

<p>Then you have the democrats trying to tell you that we need more taxes and have big business pay its fair share, while when having power never closing the loop holes the gaint corps use to get out of paying taxes. This places the burden on the middle class. The mom and pop stores, the people trying to get out of corporate control.</p>

<p>Then the republicans exclaim less taxes and more often than not it is for big corpations while maintaining the large taxes on self employment and small business. Mind you this is all at the federal level. Then you have your states trying taking money from you, then your cities. All the while you have no control on the flow of that cash.</p>

<p>What kind of system is that. We&#39;ve got the internet now Do we need the tax man taking our money and telling us they know best how to spend it? Can we not put our money where we want and see a vastly more effective system emerge. Something that is optional. I see with the crowd funding projects that there is no shortage of people that are willing to donate on top of being taxed. So can we not think a system, in which it breaks down the flow of cash and have public transparency. </p>

<p>An optional percent tax that we have a say where it goes? Might this not help alleviate our burden and become a more effective system.</p>
