<p>Cosmopolitan means <em>being everywhere at home</em> not just being a f**** billionaire. Your basic hobo is more of a cosmopolitan than a guy who forces his own traditions down everyones throat. </p>

<p>There are actually very few newspapers which at least try to be cosmopolitan, which try to adept to local tarditions, culture and language. </p>

<p>Only and only if said person (or city) promotes an exchange between the cultures.  A conservative nationalist (regardless of political affiliation, religion or skin colour) which avoids the cultural exchange might live in a cosmopolitan city but is certainly no cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>E.g. FOX news is certainly no cosmopolitan news outlet altough they have headquaters in cosmopolitan cities. </p>

<p>It also shows you the damage that a narrow understanding of &quot;Western culture and civilization&quot; did to the world. We are probably on the same page that lack of law, genocide complete lack of social security and rigid racial and social borders are <em>nothing</em> to be proud of. But we are probably also on the same page when we cite the belief in <em>inherent</em> human rights and a <em>state of law</em> as the best things the western civilization has to provide.</p>

<p>Nationalism stands against the first principle by simply building arbitary borders and promoting a divide which has only arbitary roots in the real world. You don&#39;t promote principle by breaking them. You don&#39;t promote social equality (at least before the law) by looking down on homeless and minorities. You don&#39;t promote a <em>state of law</em> by having secret tribunals which hand out death sentences..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just change the subject to one discussing actual, relevant information. A lot of threads tend to quickly switch to jokes and off-topic discussion. We need to be more careful about that, so here is some information. </p>

<p>This topic can be divisive, but it shouldn&#39;t be. Both sides submit false police reports. People from both sides have decided that they really wanted to feel like victims, and creating a fake story would help &quot;spread the word&quot; about their oppression. We should all be against fake &quot;victims,&quot; no matter where they come from, because it takes away from the true hate crime stories. </p>

<p>There is a huge list somewhere out there of tons of these, but here is a list of the ones I found interesting and which had a decent news article to go with it. Oftentimes these are reported in the national media and the article is then later corrected, which means there are more people who see the initial allegation than the correction, which makes it seem like there are a lot more hate crimes than there really are. Sometimes the biggest stories that go viral in the media are the ones that turn out to be false. </p>

<p>CNN updated the article to say &quot;Authorities have determined that tombstones disturbed at a historic Jewish cemetery in New York this weekend were damaged by environmental causes and not by vandalism.&quot; </p>

<p>A 19-year-old Israeli Jewish man (not Trump supporters and nazis as initially thought) has been arrested in Israel on suspicion of making multiple bomb threats to Jewish organisations and an airline in the US and elsewhere. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/23/israeli-police-arrest-man-over-bomb-threats-to-us-jewish-targets">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/23/israeli-police-arrest-man-over-bomb-threats-to-us-jewish-targets</a></p>

<p>The other person arrested over making threats to Jewish community centers was Juan Thompson, a Black anti-Trump leftist who worked for The Intercept until he was fired for fabricating sources in his anti-Trump articles. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/03/statement-on-the-arrest-of-former-intercept-reporter-juan-thompson/">https://theintercept.com/2017/03/03/statement-on-the-arrest-of-former-intercept-reporter-juan-thompson/</a></p>

<p>An openly bisexual Chicago student who claimed she received anti-gay, pro-Donald Trump notes and emails after the election is found to have fabricated the entire story, North Park University said. Taylor Volk told a local NBC News affiliate that she found one of the notes taped to her door at her off-campus residence, which read “Back to hell” and “#Trump” along with homophobic slurs. “This is a countrywide epidemic all of a sudden,” she said on Nov. 14. “I just want them to stop.” <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/25/taylor-volk-north-park-university-student-fabricat/">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/25/taylor-volk-north-park-university-student-fabricat/</a>  </p>

<p>Strong accusations were made by a Bowling Green State University student the day after election day. Eleesha Long said she was assaulted and called a racial slur, but BG police said she made the story up. Long wrote a police complaint on November 9th that reads in part, &quot;while walking down Crim St to ask for yard signs, three boys began to throw rocks at me.&quot; Long continued to write the white males shouted profanity at her while wearing Trump shirts. She described how all three young men looked and what they were wearing. <a href="http://www.13abc.com/content/news/BG-police-say-student-lied-about-politically-driven-attack-401814426.html">http://www.13abc.com/content/news/BG-police-say-student-lied-about-politically-driven-attack-401814426.html</a></p>

<p>In the latest case of a faked hate crime, a 20-year-old man has admitted he made it up when he told Malden cops he was harassed by two men proclaiming it’s “Trump country now.” The man, whose name police have not released, had filed a complaint saying when he got off an MBTA bus near Broadway Square in Malden at 10 p.m. Tuesday, at least two white men approached him.  <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_coverage/2016/11/man_admits_to_faking_hate_crime_in_malden">http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_coverage/2016/11/man_admits_to_faking_hate_crime_in_malden</a></p>

<p>A Colorado Springs man was arrested after police believe he left racist messages outside a church. Vincent Broughton, 44, who is black, is facing charges for committed a bias-motivated crime and disorderly conduct. The signs were posted outside the New Covenant church that is predominately attended by African Americans. One sign references the KKK. Another reads, “Black men beware, you are the target.” <a href="http://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/06/30/suspect-arrested-after-racist-message-discovered-outside-church/">http://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/06/30/suspect-arrested-after-racist-message-discovered-outside-church/</a></p>

<p>The students identified as the people behind a recent racist drawing found at Salisbury University’s library are black, school officials confirmed Tuesday. The image, found April 10 on a whiteboard in Blackwell Library, showed a stick figure being hung and labeled with a racial slur. Underneath was the hashtag “#whitepower.” <a href="http://college.usatoday.com/2016/04/27/black-students-connected-in-su-racist-drawing/">http://college.usatoday.com/2016/04/27/black-students-connected-in-su-racist-drawing/</a></p>

<p>Woman admits tweeting fake threats to fellow black students. According to prosecutors, the 25-year-old McKelvey tweeted threats from a campus library because she wanted more people to attend the November 17, 2015, rally on racial issues. She then returned to the rally to tell people about the threats. One tweet addressed to campus police read: &quot;@kupolice I will kill all the blacks tonight, tomorrow and any other day if they go to Kean University.&quot; <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/woman-admits-tweeting-fake-threats-fellow-black-students-204320195.html">https://www.yahoo.com/news/woman-admits-tweeting-fake-threats-fellow-black-students-204320195.html</a></p>

<p>Police have zeroed in on an unexpected culprit as being behind a racist, pro-Trump graffiti spree in Philadelphia: a 58-year-old black man. The graffiti included “Trump Rules” and “Black B----.” <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/05/black-man-arrested-after-pro-trump-racist-graffiti-spree-in-philadelphia.html">http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/12/05/black-man-arrested-after-pro-trump-racist-graffiti-spree-in-philadelphia.html</a></p>

<p>Over the summer, 19-year-old Jesus Cabrera told police he was verbally harassed by three white men, authorities said. He said the men made disparaging remarks about his ethnicity, and police in turn investigated the incident as a hate crime. He was arrested Friday after police say he admitted to making up the story. <a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/East-Palo-Alto-Man-Arrested-for-Falsely-Reporting-Hate-Crime-365063461.html">http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/East-Palo-Alto-Man-Arrested-for-Falsely-Reporting-Hate-Crime-365063461.html</a></p>

<p>Openly-gay Pastor admits he lied about a Whole Foods incident that caused a public outcry, claiming that a cake he bought at Whole Foods was decorated with a homophobic slur.  The company also released a statement saying that it reviewed security footage and determined that Brown had tampered with the cake.  He later said &quot;The company did nothing wrong. I was wrong to pursue this matter and use the media to perpetuate this story.  I want to apologize to Whole Foods and its team members for questioning the company&#39;s commitment to its values, and especially the bakery associate who I understand was put in a terrible position because of my actions.&quot; <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pastor-drops-lawsuit-against-whole-foods-2016-5">http://www.businessinsider.com/pastor-drops-lawsuit-against-whole-foods-2016-5</a></p>

<p>As you said, it doesn&#39;t matter what ethnicity they are. Murdering innocent people should never be acceptable and we have to stand against ideologies that promote bigotry and violence, and defend the most vulnerable groups. Unfortunately, innocent muslims are a popular target in the current political climate. Even in this thread, someone was defending this anti-muslim terrorist attack. </p>

<p>The <strong>non-binding motion</strong>, which condemns &quot;Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination&quot;, passed on Thursday among a divided parliament. </p>

<p>It asks a parliamentary committee to launch a study on how the government could address the issue, with recommendations due in mid-November.   </p>

<p>The study should look at how to &quot;develop a whole-of-government approach to reducing or eliminating systemic racism and religious discrimination, including Islamophobia,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m still against this type of thing because it seems like a ridiculous overreaction on the part of the government in the face of how common actual violence targeting Muslims is in Canada (i.e. not very much at all), but you&#39;re equally overreacting here.</p>

<p>Really? Give me one example of someone in the United Kingdom or Germany being put in jail or fined for giving an honest critique of Islam. I&#39;m well aware that those countries are more strict in their interpretation of &#39;hate speech&#39;, and as an American I&#39;ve found myself inclined to disagree with their policies that limit the expression of ideas (though I also totally understand them), but I&#39;ve yet to hear of anyone actually receive criminal punishment for &quot;criticising Islam&quot; in particular. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Except, he even says &quot;There’s a range of experiences when people come home. We know that actually someone who has engaged and turned away from that hateful ideology can be an extraordinarily powerful voice for preventing radicalization in future generations and younger people within the community.&quot;</p>

<p>Trudeau specifically says that the people he&#39;s talking about are ones that have turned away from ISIL&#39;s extremist ideology, and that they can be useful in teaching and preventing other people from making the same decision, much in the same way that people who had their lives ruined by drug use or committed grievous crimes (i.e. sexual assault, murder, etc.) are often some of the most prolific in speaking out against those things, including to youth. Nowhere in there is it apparent that he wants to bring ISIS fighters that still pose a danger back into the country, or that they should get away with any crimes they may have committed.</p>

<p>And &quot;taxpayer-funded social programs&quot; for rehabilitating former jihadists is just the same as having &quot;taxpayer-funded social programs&quot; for rehabilitating drug addicts or criminals in prisons. It&#39;s part of a much larger political argument in general and not really relevant.</p>

<p>The people indicted as per this article were from countries like Egypt, not Germany or the UK.

<p>This is in line with existing laws. You can&#39;t just hurl religiously motivated insults at people in public and expect to get away with it in the U.K. This is not some woman giving an honest critique of Islam in the slightest.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is part of the same debate as &quot;should business owners be allowed to decide not to serve people for discriminatory reasons?&quot; argument. The same could be made for any ethnic minority (or the majority), or homosexuals, or whatever. There are laws against this in Canada and the US. If you think that the right of a business owner to decide who and who not to serve (regardless of reason) trumps the right of individuals to have equal access to things in the market, that&#39;s fine, but that&#39;s a totally separate argument and isn&#39;t indicative of some &quot;conspiracy to illegalize the criticism of Islam.&quot;</p>

<p>You seemed to have missed my point. I already acknowledged that European laws restricting what they define as &quot;hate speech&quot; are considerably strong. <em>However</em> you&#39;ve provided no evidence that people are actually being indicted for <em>legitimate</em> criticisms of Islam. </p>

<p>&quot;Get these sandnigger rapefugees out of my country&quot; is not a legitimate criticism of Islam, it&#39;s blatant hatred. Do I think it should be criminalized? No. But we&#39;re talking about productive criticisms, i.e. someone in <em>Western Europe</em> (not <em>Egypt</em>) being imprisoned for giving an academic critique arguing that verses in the Quran are too suggestive of violence, or even just citing criminal statistics among groups of immigrants or migrants, which doesn&#39;t seem to have happened. Based on the way the law is written, I&#39;m inclined to believe that the people getting arrested are actually inciting violence in their social media and not providing anything productive. You&#39;ve yet to prove otherwise. When people in the US or Canada can be sent into jail for giving actual, honest critiques of Islam, like the man in Egypt, then we&#39;ll talk.</p>

<p>Edit: If the fact that this was a motion isn&#39;t concerning to you, you&#39;re a lazy thinker.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly its funny in this day and age though I was just thinking this the other day. We have more &quot;information&quot; now a days but less insight I feel. Maybe I was just too young to figure it out but 20 years ago when I was growing up I felt like the news (in whatever format) gave you the news. Now I feel like news is more like opinion peices on everything. But maybe thats just growing up and seeing the man behind the curtain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The episode arose when Mohamed reassembled the parts of a digital clock in an 8-inch (20 cm) pencil container, and brought it to school to show his teachers. His English teacher thought the clock resembled a bomb, confiscated it, and reported Mohamed to the school&#39;s principal. Local law enforcement was called and Mohamed was questioned by police for an hour and a half. After being handcuffed and taken into custody without being permitted to see his parents, he was transported to a juvenile detention facility where he was fingerprinted and his mug shot photograph was taken. He was then released to his parents. It was alleged that the reason for his arrest was for purposely trying to cause a bomb scare. The case was not pursued further by juvenile justice authorities; however, Mohamed was suspended from school.</p>

<p>I doubt it. In another sub I put out a potential explanation: let&#39;s say she doesn&#39;t want to wear the hijab, so she takes it off when she leaves home. Maybe it gets dragged on the ground and winds up with salt stains - can&#39;t explain that to mom and dad if you were wearing the thing on your head all day - so you cut off the stained part and make up a story.</p>

<p>To assume that the news has a responsibility to say &quot;we don&#39;t believe her story, and <em>this is what really happened</em>&quot; is a bit much. Maybe her dad is a raging asshole and they don&#39;t want to print that. Maybe she personally doesn&#39;t believe in the religion but is terrified of her parents finding out. The cops would have known that and they would protect her above giving the public a few meaningless details.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. We don&#39;t know why she made up this story but it&#39;s far more likely that her dumb 11 year old brain thought that making up a story about being attacked could accomplish her end goal.

<p>Because religions are fucking stupid. In the 5th grade I gave a girl a teddy bear on the last day of school. She went to her parents as they were picking her up... they made her come back and return it to me because &quot;Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses only date for the purpose of marriage&quot;.</p>

<p>In a statement sent to CTVNews.ca Monday afternoon, Office of the Prime Minister spokesperson Eleanore Catenaro said, “We are thankful and relieved that this incident did not take place.”</p>

<p>“We have seen an unfortunate pattern of increased hate crimes in past months directed towards religious minorities, particularity towards women,” the PMO statement also said. “We need to take this issue extremely seriously as this pattern is a warning sign of increased intolerance.”</p>

Just like the case with Obama, many people were fed up, sick of the status quo and him saying all the things he thought the people expected him too, while doing a whole lot of nothing to improve our country. Since your next election is approaching soon, do you see many other Canadians ready for something new? Are their any potential candidates that have a chance to get elected and straighten things out? As someone who lives only 10 miles from Ontario and visits quite often, I sure hope the people see the damage that&#39;s being done and vote to change it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>‘I felt really scared and confused’ — girl attacked twice by man who cut her hijab in Scarborough</p>

<p>11-year-old Khawlah Noman says she was walking to school with her younger brother when the man approached and cut her hijab. Police say they are treating the attack as a hate crime. They are seeking one suspect described as an Asian man in his 20s.</p>

<p>When her attacker pulled her hood down, she said he cut her hijab from the bottom up. Terrified, she turned to face him — a young Asian male, roughly 5-foot-8 to six feet tall, wearing black pants, a black hoodie and brown gloves. He had a moustache, the girl told police, and glasses, too. He was smiling at her.</p>

<p>The assault against Khawlah, a student at Pauline Johnson Junior Public School in Scarborough, is being condemned by leaders from all three levels of government as unrepresentative of Canadian values.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine how afraid she must have been,” said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in an unprompted statement of support for Khawlah at a news conference in London, Ont.</p>

<p>also theres precedent for these kinds of things being false reports, jews have scribbled swastikas on their own doors, fake gay slurs, etc. its a common move and its not unfair to speculate that this one in particular would have been as well. turns out it follows the pattern. its not chance that people recognize this pattern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anyone has actually bothered to read  that shit hole of a book called the &#39;Quran&#39;, it states that Muslims can lie to non believes if it furthers the growth of their religion. Hmmm... so could this possibly mean they can actively perpetuate lies as long as it helps only them? Yes, yes it does.           </p>

<p>So what the fuck do you think that opens the door to? 95% of anything out of a dirty muzzies mouth is a lie. They ultimately want to trash your religion &amp; replace it with their own, because they are too stupid to take care of their own country so they claim racism &amp; refugee then come fuck up everything your ancestors built. If you can&#39;t see that, you are part of the problem. </p>

That&#39;s the real message that people are putting across with posts like this. Why is it a conspiracy? Without knowing what happened to speculate is a waste of time and just provides a breeding ground for hysteria and ignorance. Maybe the girl lied to get attention. Maybe the &quot;attack&quot; really happened and it&#39;s being covered up. Maybe it was Hillary! She was going to #pizzagate this girl but she got away and Soros paid off the cops! Who knows?

<p>Race is an immutable characteristic, hating someone for an immutable characteristic is always wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok...I think my point was lost somewhere in here.</p>

<p>My point was, take the Hawaii missle incident for example, while not a hoax it was a false alarm. Do we really need to be reminded that a hostile country could fire a missle at us at anytime even though they didn&#39;t do it yet? Stating the obvious.</p>

<p>I doubt anyone in Canada thought to themselves &quot;ah see, nobody hates Muslims.&quot;</p>

<p>There’s over a billion Muslims on the planet, from all sorts of different races. I was just trying to clarify that people who dislike Islam aren’t necessarily racists. There’s plenty of reasons from a secular humanist perspective to dislike Islam. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect any of them to apologise anytime soon for being the blubbering idiots they all happen to be but who knows maybe they&#39;ll try to act a little bit more like the reasonable and responsible officials we&#39;re paying for them to be a little more often after this complete farce and how utterly ridiculous they&#39;ve made themselves look.</p>

<p>No question in some thirty million Canadian minds about what was genuinely un-Canadian about this event and it wasn&#39;t the incident but how it wasn&#39;t rather than was handled right from the get-go.</p>

<p>Really? Give me one example of someone in the United Kingdom or Germany being put in jail or fined for giving an honest critique of Islam. I&#39;m well aware that those countries are more strict in their interpretation of &#39;hate speech&#39;, and as an American I&#39;ve found myself inclined to disagree with their policies that limit the expression of ideas (though I also totally understand them), but I&#39;ve yet to hear of anyone actually receive criminal punishment for &quot;criticising Islam&quot; in particular.</p>

<p>He&#39;s saying that because there are zero laws preventing Islamic Immigrant radicalized Terrorist ISIS fighters from returning to Canada, Sweden, Germany and England, so of course he has to say some shit to cover his ass.</p>

<p>The NDP is not a factor. Trudeau is a predictable disaster. Even seeing the right and nationalist resurgence in the US, Trudeau is still repeating Obama&#39;s globalist mistakes. On purpose. He is actively making these bad decisions knowing that they are bad decisions. Which leads me to believe that he, like obama, are getting their marching orders from the globalists overseas.</p>
