<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>We spend so much of our lives in school, so I find it pretty shocking that more and more students simply are not ready for college-level reading tasks:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/10928755/ns/us_news-education/t/reports-college-literacy-levels-sobering/">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/10928755/ns/us_news-education/t/reports-college-literacy-levels-sobering/</a></p>

<p>Further, there is a long, steady decline of literary reading:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/07/the-long-steady-decline-of-literary-reading/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/07/the-long-steady-decline-of-literary-reading/</a></p>

<p>Students spend thousands of hours of their free time online, but they certainly are not spending it educating themselves.</p>

<p>None of this may be new to you, but it is concerning that most simply do not care. Who needs reading, I guess, when people have thousands of hours of entertainment at their fingertips? Who needs reading when we have video games, apps, and YouTube? Besides, how is this a conspiracy? Perhaps it is simply the result of a technological age we are in?</p>

<p>I think it goes deeper than that, and I do think there is a collective “agenda” for getting people to devalue the process of reading and reflection. To put it simply, the limits of our language are the limits of our world (Ludwig Wittgenstein).</p>

<p>In this post, I want to argue that there are several conspiracies regarding reading and reflection, the biggest being that without the ability to read critically, people really can never wake up. No matter a person’s life circumstances, I think it is extremely difficult to wake up without the ability to read and think for oneself (or even impossible, really).</p>

<p><strong>The Decline of Reading</strong></p>

<p>So, why are people reading less? By the way, for the sake of this post, I am not going to consider reading Instagram comments and such as the type of reading I am talking about. The type of reading I am talking about is academic reading, or reading to learn or grow in some way. </p>

<p>In other words, “In “The Gutenberg Elegies,” Sven Birkerts laments the loss of “deep reading,” which requires intense concentration, a conscious lowering of the gates of perception, and a slower pace.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/07/21/the-death-of-reading-is-threatening-the-soul/?utm_term=.dcd041ac144d">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/07/21/the-death-of-reading-is-threatening-the-soul/?utm_term=.dcd041ac144d</a></p>

<p>Reading is a discipline, and that is the problem in our world of instant…well everything. From the same article,</p>

<p>“Nicholas Carr’s book “The Shallows” analyzes the phenomenon, and its subtitle says it all: “What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains.” Carr spells out that most Americans, and young people especially, are showing a precipitous decline in the amount of time spent reading. He says, “Once I was a scuba diver in the sea of words. Now I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet Ski.” A 2016 Nielsen report calculates that the average American devotes more than 10 hours per day to consuming media—including radio, TV, and all electronic devices. That constitutes 65 percent of waking hours, leaving little time for the much harder work of focused concentration on reading.”</p>

<p>Quite simply, people have lost the ability to discipline themselves to read, largely due to technology, and we will talk more about that later.</p>

<p><strong>Bullied for Being Smart?</strong></p>

<p>The other issue I want to discuss is a little more complex than this – the perception of reading and intellectualism. In our society, it is good to be smart, but nobody should ever be “too smart.” I remember, growing up, I was certainly not unpopular. Still, during study hall, I loved reading books, and other students would come up to me and ask me why I was reading. Reading simply is not “cool”, and it is not promoted as such. You never hear celebrities telling kids to read or anything like that. Rather, kids are being taught to consume, consume, and consume.
While the perception of ‘nerds’ and ‘geeks’ has evolved over time, the only time true intelligence seems to be valued is when it has to do with money, technology, materialism, and consumerism. Learning to simply just learn, though, is not valued in our society.
As your may or may not know, there is a dark side to being considered “very intelligent”, especially for students, and they are often victims of bullying:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/20/survey-finds-more-than-90_n_2166734.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/20/survey-finds-more-than-90_n_2166734.html</a></p>

<p>But again, why? That is where the larger conspiracy comes in – it is okay to be smart, just not too smart, and really, this just goes back to “group think” and human psychology:</p>

<p>According to one study, “Rimm said she suspected that bullying might be less a problem for gifted children who are grouped together, as in many Washington area school systems that have magnet academic programs.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/15/AR2006051501103.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/15/AR2006051501103.html</a></p>

<p>This is where I need to stop and expand. I have a belief that all children have the potential to be extremely smart. I was labeled “gifted” in school, and while I think gifted education is important, I think there is a problem behind it. There will always be a small percentage of kids who are genetically and naturally gifted, but I would like to argue that we dismiss environment when it comes to education. We dismiss the importance and influence of environment. I am not joking when I say that I believe any kid can be really smart, and it is a matter of environment more than genetics. Of course, there will always be a range of intelligence, and I am not denying “giftedness” as a concept; however, I believe that the perception of intelligence as fixed in our society is a huge problem.</p>

<p>Looking back at my environment, I had a terrible home life, but I was always encouraged to read, for hours and hours. My dad would leave books for me about Buddhism when I was 10 years old – complex texts about substantial spiritual topics, and I would read them. Though my relationship with my father has always been shoddy, I have no doubt that this directly impacted my life positively. </p>

<p>Right now, research is saying that the way we have viewed intelligence for the last hundred years or so is simply wrong. It is not fixed, and almost everybody has the potential to learn and grow, especially when they are young! There is real research about this, and it is called “growth mindset”:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/</a></p>

<p>I utilize this in my classroom daily, and it works. No matter what level my students are at, they can grow and learn.</p>

<p>So, yes, there is always going to be the genetic component to intelligence, but we need to realize that our environments do impact our student potential. So, what exactly is wrong with the environment?</p>

<p><strong>Crabs in a Bucket</strong></p>

<p>We live in a society where most do not value other’s accomplishments, and social media simply makes people jealous of others and unhappy in general:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/facebook-social-media-make-unhappy-jealous-people-particularly-sad-copenhagen-university-study-a7490816.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/facebook-social-media-make-unhappy-jealous-people-particularly-sad-copenhagen-university-study-a7490816.html</a></p>

<p>So, first of all, we live in a society where people are trained to be envious and competitive of those who are successful, and this is described as “crab mentality.” “If I cannot have it, neither can you:”</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality</a></p>

<p>But, we need to go deeper than that. It takes a village to raise a child, after all, so what exactly is going on in the different environments children experience?</p>

<p><em>Parenting</em></p>

<p>The students who I work with who are labeled as  <em>gifted</em> almost always have loving, supportive parents who educate them at home. Today, too many leave education solely up to schooling, and that is a huge mistake:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usnews.com/opinion/knowledge-bank/articles/2017-06-20/parents-need-to-play-a-role-in-their-childrens-education">https://www.usnews.com/opinion/knowledge-bank/articles/2017-06-20/parents-need-to-play-a-role-in-their-childrens-education</a></p>

<p>More and more, teachers are responsible for teaching their students EVERYTHING, which has given parents a lack of responsibility at home. I cannot believe the things I am expected to teach my students at times, when I feel they should have learned much of this at home. By the way, this can go even deeper and many parents are simply overworked and cannot provide for their children the way they should. The last thing any parent wants to do after working all day, cooking dinner, and God knows what else, is try to teach their children. I do not blame them, really, because it is a societal issue. No longer do we have a parent at home staying home with the children. Whatever you believe about feminism, my dad said it was hilarious that they somehow convinced women to want to work 40 hours a week instead of staying home with their kids and raising them(controversial, I know, but think about it!).</p>

<p>Quite simply, teachers are expected to parent, and parents do not have time to parent:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/opinions/are-teachers-expected-to-do-too-much-parenting">https://www.monash.edu/news/opinions/are-teachers-expected-to-do-too-much-parenting</a></p>

<p><em>Schools are Failing</em></p>

<p>Again, we spend so much of our lives in school, yet there are STILL students who are not ready for college. This is ridiculous. I could probably write an entire book on the problems with modern education (and I have written many posts about it), but it is my belief that they are currently and purposely failing public schools in order to privatize education. Privatization of education means there is a profit involved. This is a complex topic, but there is more about it here:</p>

<p><a href="http://jonathanpelto.com/2017/02/01/dangerous-rise-privatization-corporate-education-reform/">http://jonathanpelto.com/2017/02/01/dangerous-rise-privatization-corporate-education-reform/</a></p>

<p>The article has some interesting points, but this really stood out to me:</p>

<p>From the article, “Or take the issue of poverty.  Most teachers agree that poverty is no excuse for lousy schooling; much of our work is about proving that the potential of our students and communities can be fulfilled when their needs are met and the reality of their lives is reflected in our schools and classrooms.  But in the current reform debates, saying poverty isn’t an excuse has become an excuse for ignoring poverty.”</p>

<p>This leads to me to my next point. There is a huge issue of poverty in our country that is largely ignored. Teachers are expected to work miracles in areas of severe poverty 
(like where I work). We are ignoring the fact that many of the criseses in education today are really about criseses in poverty and the lives of children in general. Education cannot fix the consequences of poverty:</p>

<p><a href="http://mattbruenig.com/2012/03/12/education-reform-will-not-fix-poverty-or-inequality/">http://mattbruenig.com/2012/03/12/education-reform-will-not-fix-poverty-or-inequality/</a></p>

<p>Schools are a reflection of society. The schools that are failing are simply schools that are trying to work miracles in areas where people are living in an immense poverty. You can be the greatest teacher in the world, but you are not going to fix systematic injustices in equality in your classroom alone.</p>

<p>Look, I would not be a teacher if I did not feel I have the ability to help or change people, but no matter how many times they try to twist it, nothing is going to change until we work on issues of class and true inequality. While people are arguing over what restroom some guy wants to use, we have kids who are still not getting their basic needs met in our country. Intergenerational poverty is real, and there are severe consequences:</p>

<p><a href="https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac:126233">https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac:126233</a></p>

<p>We are telling these kids if they just work hard enough, they will be successful in life. That is a complete lie. The “American Dream” is deceptive:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economicpopulist.org/content/youre-born-it-america">http://www.economicpopulist.org/content/youre-born-it-america</a></p>

<p>So, I am going off on a tangent here, but what I am getting at is we are dismissing the fact that problems in education come from larger societal issues. The effects of poverty on learning, education, and reading in general, are so immense and so dismissed. The last thing these kids in poverty doing is reading, and that is what ‘they’ want:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/10/american-kids-are-starving-for-words/381552/">https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/10/american-kids-are-starving-for-words/381552/</a></p>

<p><strong>Keeping People Down</strong></p>

<p>I know I got a little off track, but I really thought about the power of reading, and this goes beyond schooling. There is so much beyond my control as a teacher, but I think that anybody and everybody can learn to read. But, what, really is the value of reading itself? I was thinking how funny it is that so many teachers tell their students to read, but they never adequately explain why reading is important:</p>

<p>1)  Reading can help you travel anywhere you want. This may sound corny, but not everyone can afford to travel. If you have the ability to read, and read well, you can literally travel anywhere in the world. You can learn almost anything through reading. Of course, I think experience is the best teacher, but reading is there when you cannot afford an experience. Reading builds empathy, experience, and perspective. Reading literary fiction improves empathy:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/novel-finding-reading-literary-fiction-improves-empathy/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/novel-finding-reading-literary-fiction-improves-empathy/</a></p>

<p>2)  A lot of people spend a lot of their time watching movies and television. The problem with that is essentially these programs are doing the thinking for us. Most people watch and listen to things they already believe in, and there simply is no critical thinking involved. There are tons of studies on the downfalls of watching too much television (or similar media):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/watching-lots-of-tv-makes-you-stupid-says-american-universities-a6759026.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/watching-lots-of-tv-makes-you-stupid-says-american-universities-a6759026.html</a></p>

<p>Further, when we read, we have to critically think to build the experiences in our mind. This requires higher order thinking, and it is likely the reason why the movies are never as good as the books. We spent time constructing a world in our minds based off of what we read. When we watch a movie, the world is there, as it is, and it requires little critical thought:</p>

<p>“Once a filmmaker decides upon settings and characters, we’re limited to seeing those characters and settings through their eyes. However, 500 different readers of the same book may have 500 different ideas of a character’s appearance.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/6-reasons-the-book-is-almost-always-better-than-the-movie/">https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/6-reasons-the-book-is-almost-always-better-than-the-movie/</a></p>

<p>Reading builds our imagination and our critical thought processes. Unfortunately, the upcoming generation is not learning to examine what they watch. When you read something, yes, there is always a bias, but the bias is not as strong when compared to viewing something visually. When a child watches something, there is so much going on, and it may be difficult to pick up on every little thing. For example, here is a channel called “Queer Kids Stuff”:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqN_G1j9jZc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqN_G1j9jZc</a></p>

<p>There is A LOT going on, and this is aimed at children. It moves quickly, and if these children have not yet developed prominent critical thinking skills, they might simply believe what is being told to them without questioning it. </p>

<p>3)  Finally, reading (and education in general) is the equalizer. When I am talking about education, I am not necessarily talking about schooling. As most of us know on a conspiracy forum, schooling is more about indoctrination than anything. If people really want to be educated, reading is the true path. While I find teachers extremely important, I tell my students that they can actually be their own teachers! I guide them, always, of course, but at a certain point, the highest level of thinking is teaching oneself. Students are reliant on schools to teach them, when anybody can learn anything at anytime for free, even the very poor! In a world full of unlimited information, most are not using it to learn, and that is what concerns me. When given a choice, there is just too much distraction. Is a student going to watch the mindless cat video, or use their time to learn another language? What do you really think?</p>

<p>Reading gives us the ability to explore so many different worlds and perspectives. If people, in general, are reading less, they simply are losing the ability to see the world from many points of view. I mean, why do you think slaves historically are limited to be able to learn to read and write (or the lower classes in general?)</p>

<p><a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/USASeducation.htm">http://spartacus-educational.com/USASeducation.htm</a></p>

<p>Why do you think the elite send their children to the best of the best schools in the world? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/business/a-rich-childs-edge-in-public-education.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/business/a-rich-childs-edge-in-public-education.html</a></p>

<p>Reading is education and education is power.</p>

<p><strong>Self-Reflection</strong></p>

<p>Finally, reading teaches people self-reflective skills, and that seems to be declining in our society:</p>

<p>“Learning from texts is an essential skill for college success, and in an increasingly complex and interconnected world it is ever more important that students develop the intellectual and practical skills for lifelong learning. The aim of this project was to evaluate the impact of reading reflections on student reading, learning, and self-awareness as learners. Students submit reading reflections after completing each reading assignment. These reflections not only encourage students to read more regularly, they also promote content mastery and foster student development of monitoring, self-evaluation, and reflection skills. For the instructor, reading reflections can also be used to facilitate &#39;just-in-time&#39; teaching. Our results thus far confirm that the introduction of reading reflections in our courses has resulted in significant improvements in student reading and course performance.”</p>

<p><a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/acm_teagle/projects/wirth.html">https://serc.carleton.edu/acm_teagle/projects/wirth.html</a></p>

<p>Many students have difficult reading “boring” texts, but this is where they are not understanding and where they are being misled.There is value in reading all types of texts, even the boring ones. The value is the ability to reflect on different things, like “Why is the text boring to me?” “Why didn’t I like it?”
In a world where people feel the need to be constantly entertained, we have forgotten that boredom can be good and promote creative thought:</p>

<p><a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/acm_teagle/projects/wirth.html">https://serc.carleton.edu/acm_teagle/projects/wirth.html</a></p>

<p>Can reading be boring? YES! And teachers need to stop lying to their students. Reading can be boring, but it is what we do with the reading that makes it interesting and engaging. Reading is a discipline. We teach students, in athletics, for example, the power of repetition and practice, but we are not teaching them about reading. </p>

<p>Teachers today are so expected to entertain, that students are losing the ability to be bored and learn to discipline themselves so that they can learn something new.</p>

<p>This is a huge downfall in education today. Teachers are afraid of boring their students (and I do not blame them), but I have learned entertainment is NOT engagement. If you are a parent or teacher reading this, you can engage students by giving them purpose behind what they are doing. For example, I always give my students research-based reasons why I do things in my classroom. You may not think they care, but they do. Nobody wants to waste their time, and that is what is happening in classrooms. Again, students are spending years sitting there, never learning anything, and not even being prepared for college. Something is wrong here.</p>

<p>When we teach students the art of self-reflection, we are teaching them to examine their world critically.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>When I was writing this post, I was thinking about how to get people to “wake up.” I have a belief that experience is what helps most people wake up, which is why &#39;they&#39; keep most people in their little, comfortable bubbles. If people live monotonous lives, working and never really having the ability to leave their bubbles, they may never have the ability to question reality (Truman Show?). No matter what race, religion, or background, the ability to read allows people to wake up. People can explore the questions of the universe, even if they are very poor, tired, ill, depressed, distraught, whatever. Wherever somebody is in life, they can always read and learn. </p>

<p>I think this quote is quite relevant:</p>

<p>“Once you learn to read, you will be forever free. —Frederick Douglass”</p>

<p>Reading is freedom. We are getting to a point where more and more is censored, and we may even lose the ability to speak freely in a world of political correctness, but I always think, they can never take my mind away (I mean they could, but I will not let them.)</p>

<p>If nothing else, we have the power to read and learn, and they can burn all the books they want, and censor anything they want, but I have this belief that humans will always find a way.</p>

<p>I am not saying that you have to read a novel every day. I am saying that, in general, if people used reading as their main source of “entertainment”, this world would be a better place.
By the way, I think it is great to get kids to read things that they do not like! We need to stop constantly trying to make everything perfect and comfortable. Discomfort helps us learn, in the end:</p>

<p>“Any book that helps a child to form a habit of reading, to make reading one of his needs, is good for him.&quot; —Maya Angelou</p>

<p>Finally, </p>

<p>“16. We read to know we are not alone. —C.S. Lewis”</p>

<p>Why do I write so much on Reddit? Why do I spend so much time here.? Because it helps me know I am not alone. It gives me faith and hope in the world.</p>

<p>If you read all of this, thank you! And I never include tldrs for my posts because it simply amazing when somebody has the discipline to read it all. </p>

Speed reading definitely helps you pull out the important bits from a page that might not be so clear if you labor over every word. Comes in handy for reading these translations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about the internet causing the decline of attentive reading (as a practice). If you look back at popular American authors the 1800s, you can see that something drastic has happened and that it started long before the internet came about.</p>

<p>Who, these days, could actually sit down and tackle a door-stopper novel like <em>Moby-Dick</em> or <em>Last of the Mohicans?</em> And that&#39;s just on their sheer size. Once you&#39;ve got beyond the title-page, you discover huge and complicated sentences, rippling with nuance and subtlety. </p>

<p>You have to get to grips with the thoughts and actions of lots of characters (including, usually, the narrator), not all of which will be clear at first encounter and may actually turn out to be misleading. </p>

<p>And you have to metabolise a huge amount of &#39;scenery&#39; - the background historical/environmental/political/social/etc context(s) in which the characters are embedded.</p>

<p>Yet these novels were going into third, fourth, fifth printings of their first editions alone (meaning the initial supply ran out and another batch had to be printed immediately to satisfy demand), and then staying continuously in print for a fucking century!</p>

<p>Our ancestors were different in a lot of ways, socially speaking, but this is only two or three generations ago, and our brains haven&#39;t taken an evolutionary leap in the meantime. Why did reading ability wither so dramatically, and when exactly did it happen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder what is cause and what is effect, when it comes to tech. Attentive reading was already in decline, long before (e.g.) the earliest mobile phones came on the market. So while digital tech might have had an impact, it looks more like it was already riding a downward wave. </p>

<p>You&#39;re definitely onto something though imho. I wonder whether it is the projected light of computer displays that is the key factor, having a television-like hypnotic effect that hinders attentive reading. It&#39;s noticeable that the much-hyped &quot;book killers&quot;, Kindle and its clones, all have matte displays that don&#39;t beam any light into the reader&#39;s face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll begin by stating that I probably read more books by the time I was twenty than any ten of my friends or classmates in school and at least that many again as an adult.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also going to be 70 on my next birthday so I really am one of those old codgers who actually is from two or three generations ago that really does typify the kind of people you assume were all more dedicated and accomplished readers, except for one small but important detail. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t by choice on their part, as it was on mine and only a very few others, but rather of necessity... simply the way the world was back then which wasn&#39;t a whole lot different from what it had been going all the way back to the creation and expansion of public schools in general and what in all seriousness was called &quot;a formal education&quot; that was far more focussed on the formality than it was on what passed for an education. </p>

<p>Ever hear of &quot;Penmanship&quot;? Straight pens, lamp-black ink, blotters, and doing all of your schoolwork with such primitive tools and in ways that weren&#39;t actually any better than the quills that people wrote with way back when? </p>

<p>That&#39;s how I and most of my contemporaries actually started out. When fountain pens became cheap and reliable enough, like grade 4, they finally provided or let us provide our own. Wasn&#39;t until grade 7 or 8 they finally allowed ball-point pens, just to give you a bit of background on just how antiquated and desperately trying to catch-up with a world that was running faster and faster than it was.</p>

<p>I basically learned to read and was completely fascinated by books before I was even old enough to go to school and kept it up, very often at the expense of all the textbooks and assigned works of so-called great literature I simply couldn&#39;t stand reading, analyzing, and dissecting to death at a snail&#39;s pace in a classroom setting.</p>

<p>What I read, I read mainly to escape the boredom and tedious nature of that and a completely authoritarian system that was long on punishment and short on rewards.</p>

<p>From my own perspective I&#39;d have to say that in addition to that, television, and of course movies, on both the big and little screens based on classic or well known fiction novels, and increasingly more available and even made for children as time went along, all had all had a very great deal to do with the decline in both reading and writing skills that coincided with people and especially children simply having and being able to afford to watch more and more of them on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a common enough experience to say that if you&#39;ve seen the movie you won&#39;t want to read or ever like the book, and if you&#39;ve already read the book, you generally won&#39;t like the movie or walk away from it without feeling let-down and disappointed by characters that were nothing like the ones you imagined and missing all kinds of things that were the main reason why you actually liked it. </p>

<p>And we don&#39;t <em>just read</em> any book either. If it doesn&#39;t initially pique our curiosity, fire-up our imagination, or start to take us for a ride through some unexpected events and adventures pretty early on, we&#39;re bound to put it down and pass it up. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about &quot;expectations&quot; and we&#39;re not anywhere as demanding about those expectations when it comes to TV or movies as we are when it comes to whatever books we choose to read. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t usually turn the TV off and totally dismiss the idea of watching it to go and do something else the way we&#39;ll dismiss the idea of reading a book to go and do something else, instead, rather than looking for another book if it doesn&#39;t suit us.</p>

<p>If the book disappoints it usually dispels and puts us out of any frame of mind to read at that point. If one TV program disappoints we&#39;re more inclined to simply move on to another, and another, gradually lowering our expectations as we go until we find something we can simply bear watching.</p>

<p>Schooling has always put a great many people off reading altogether and that has always been true. Being forced and compelled to read so much simply as matter of routine and on a fixed schedule from one subject to the next every day invariably creates resentment and the educational system&#39;s choice of fictional works for their strictly literary purposes and plodding through them day after day, stopping to note and getting into analyzing them to death in a classroom setting simply sucks any life and enjoyment right out of them. </p>

<p>When reading was pretty much the best, most affordable, and readily available form of entertainment obviously far more people still persevered and continued to read and got better at it and grew to enjoy it. </p>

<p>When they didn&#39;t have to do that as much they didn&#39;t, and of course children learn by example. I was initially sparked by plenty of books in my house and having a father that continuously read all kinds of books having grown up in an era of tough times with very little in the way of entertainment that anyone could afford without scrimping and making a special occasion out of it only once in while.</p>

<p>All of which is to say that what is pretty much available today in the form of not just movies but most of them that have ever been made, and not just some of the best TV shows but practically all of them that were ever made, that anyone can pick and choose from and view at the the drop of hat for free or practically free while good books have simply have become more rare and more expensive by comparison. A complete reversal from what the situation originally was only a few generations ago.</p>

<p>I also used to find it concerning. These days, not so much. It is what it is.</p>

<p>Even on this sub, among people who (ostensibly) are aware that great deceptions are taking place, you will find that most are entirely apathetic and unwilling to invest even a small amount of time into genuine, independent research. And that is okay, it is what is.</p>

<p>In my experience the most rewarding thing we can do is find people who share our <em>willingness to think for oneself</em>, and <em>ability to reconsider preexisting beliefs</em>, and focus our energies on these people, rather than on the lemming masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were several good one liners, but it’s just generally good writing that continually reinforces itself through repetition - and there is a good deal of wisdom to be had in it too, in fact that is the underlying premise of it, to provide wisdom.    Just start off with Chapter 1 and go from there.   </p>

<p>There were several things that struck me with it,</p>

<p>1) The tone is strong.    Strong judgements seem to be avoided at all costs in this day in age.    But God doesn’t play that and it’s good to be reminded that someone out there can put their foot down when righteousness is on the line.   This was stirring.    It’s good to be stirred.</p>

<p>2) It really condemns hoes.    It got me thinking about subtle misogyny and if the Good Book was actually an instrument to keep the woman down by suppressing her desires while at the same time giving leeway to the man.   It got me thinking about Mary Magdalene and I researched her a little.    I chuckled a bit about some of the stuff and gave pause to the more serious notions.    </p>

<p>3) It’s prescription is fairly simple...</p>

<p>There’s a bit more to say, but it’s getting late.   Give it a read and see if you can find something of meaning for yourself.    </p>

<p>To the point of your post though, reading does prompt observation, judgement, curiosity, and helps fine tune our understanding of the world.    It really is amazing what a few pages can do.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, are you reading anything currently?   Has there been a book that’s stood out to you that you think others could benefit from?    </p>

<p>&quot;Don’t give up on books. They feel so good — their friendly heft. The sweet reluctance of their pages when you turn them with your sensitive fingertips.

<p>An excerpt from Brave New World Revisited <a href="https://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/">https://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Our contemporary Western society, in spite of its material, intellectual and political progress, is in­creasingly less conducive to mental health, and tends to undermine the inner security, happiness, reason and the capacity for love in the individual; it tends to turn him into an automaton who pays for his human failure with increasing mental sickness, and with despair hidden under a frantic drive for work and so-called pleasure.</p>

<p>Our &quot;increasing mental sickness&quot; may find expres­sion in neurotic symptoms. These symptoms are con­spicuous and extremely distressing. But &quot;let us beware,&quot; says Dr. Fromm, &quot;of defining mental hygiene as the prevention of symptoms. Symptoms as such are not our enemy, but our friend; where there are symp­toms there is conflict, and conflict always indicates that the forces of life which strive for integration and happiness are still fighting.&quot; The really hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. &quot;Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been si­lenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does.&quot; They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their per­fect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish &quot;the illusion of indi­viduality,&quot; but in fact they have been to a great extent deindividualized. Their conformity is developing into something like uniformity. But &quot;uniformity and free­dom are incompatible. Uniformity and mental health are incompatible too. . . . Man is not made to be an automaton, and if he becomes one, the basis for mental health is destroyed&quot;.</p>

<p>They really do want people to stop questioning. Its time to overthrow them.</p>

<p>Consider the 50 Shades of Grey and Twilight franchises and other related works of fiction. The reason they became film franchises is because millions of people read the books. Granted the penmanship of the novels are so-so, nonetheless people read these works.  </p>

<p>the &#39;leave no child behind&#39; policy is basically creating the &#39;crabs in a bucket&#39; scenario.</p>

<p>Anybody who has any experience with education and basic psychology knows that if you want to motivate students to improve and develop, the best thing to do is create an environment of positive reinforcement. this means you reward students who make positive contributions to the classroom environment. </p>

<p>Instead, the &#39;leave no child behind&#39; policy makes teachers pay more attention to problem children. This means students who misbehave or dont understand are rewarded with attention from the teacher. bad students are rewarded and good students are ignored.</p>

<p>Truly ridiculous how they didnt see this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very interesting. For you to be a teacher and think outside of the basic school indoctrination is pretty rare, (from my experience).  I&#39;m an 18 year old and just finished high school last year. I can vouch that it is bad when it comes to consumerism in today&#39;s students.  I am completely victim to it also.  Most kids these days have never read a book in their entire life outside of being forced to half ass one in their English class.  Most of the students and including me just cliff noted the book from the internet. Kids get this sour feeling towards reading because all that comes to mind is some teacher forcing them to read something they don&#39;t. So for the rest of their life they get this sour feeling towards reading. </p>

<p>Continuing with schooling. This is my first year going to college. Now I was a &quot;good&quot; student in high school. Was in advance placement classes and never had bad grades. However, I was so unprepared as I came into college this year. I realized that all of my schooling leading up to college would be best described as &quot;a leaf floating down a stream&quot;. Everything that I have done in the past in schooling I do not remember a thing and no have no skills from classes. </p>

<p>Now that may be harsh to some teachers and I agree, because there is a few exceptions. I can count 3 teachers in high school that actually brought memorable change to myself and my skills in life. For instance I had AP Euro. Great class, why? Because of the teacher. He had our class read and write more than any class I was ever in. I learned more about reading and writing in return more than any of my 5 other English classes I took my entire high school experience.  I am not being dramatic with that statement. But he was just very respectable and actually connected with us as students. Never worried to talk about topics with his students and to reflect about anything. Nothing was censored. </p>

<p>Back to reading. Going into college now I recently got into reading. I could immediately tell a difference in my studies in college. The difference that I could tell was my mental strength and ability to read texts like you said &quot;boring texts&quot;, became much easier. As I read outside of my classes, coming back to the class work was much easier. When I found myself to stop reading outside of school I found doing my college studies and readings were much more challenging and I often would find myself just staring at the readings. </p>

<p>Another thing that most people my age I don&#39;t think have ever thought of is that learning does not mean going to a school. There is so much information and things to learn in just reading your own books. I only remember and keep with me things that I have read in my free time. So much of schooling and even now in college is so ridiculous and to my disappointment, (again depends on the professor) I still find in college that most of the at home studies we do is complete &quot;busy work&quot;. That is what most of schooling is just a bunch of monotonous work that fills our time outside of class and we memorize that material or we don&#39;t. Then we forget it within the next week or two because by then we are doing 6 other things by then and already tested that material.  </p>

<p>I also worry about the generations below me. I think my class and the few years prior were the first kids to actually grow up with social media. This is something none of the parents of these kids or teaching facility ever dealt with as a kid and still don&#39;t relate to now. None of these past generations understand the bullshit we have to deal with and our addictions we have like social media, porn, etc. That is so readily available now. Sure the adults deal with social media and internet media in general now. But none of them dealt with it as a kid. All of us including kids are just dopamine addicts. I have younger people in my family and it surprises me how uninterested they are in things that used to interest me just 10 years ago. Because now every kid has a smartphone and the things they do is so instant. None of them would be able to complete an entire ps2/ps3 game because what they have now is so instant. I have not until recently realized how much of a consumer I was and still struggle with it, but everybody else is a consumer. It is weird if you are not one.  </p>

<p>Anyway I do not ever comment on things and this is all over the place, I can keep going on. I will stop here, these are just some thoughts that came to mind when reading your post. I can agree with everything you said. Apologies if my writing is atrocious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is extremely insightful and I really appreciate your honest perspective. Would you mind if I read to my students?</p>

<p>The one thing I see with modern teaching is it is so hard to balance being liked with being too hard. When teachers have hard standards they are usually resented by students and parents.</p>

<p>Somehow I have gotten this balance over the years, and I have had students tell me the same thing - I have learned more in your class than other English classes combined.</p>

<p>I am amazing that you have the skills to reflect on all this as most simply would blame the teachers solely and not look at.the larger issues at hand.</p>

<p>I honestly had a mixture of good and bad teachers growing up, and I have always strived to be like the good teachers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When living abroad i had broken my cell phone and this was during a holiday extended weekend.  I had a good 4 days before any of the stores would open and found myself reading, television in a foreign language is terrible.  </p>

<p>Literally 15 minutes into the book i fell asleep.  This kept happening for the first couple days, a chapter in and i was exhausted!  The brain is indeed a muscle and it took me months of reading to be able to do what i did as a kid, read half novel in an evening and the rest the next day.</p>

<p>it&#39;s amazing how stupid we&#39;ve become</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It correlates to it.  You must believe that genius makes good use of instant access to information, right? </p>

<p>I may not be a genius but im working on developing a platform for long term knowledge storage.  Its underpinnings are a connectionism (see wiki for details on this paradigm)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>repetition in my eyes is the key to long term storage.  currently the digital revolution known as the internet has simply flooded people with knowledge.  we are literally the pioneers in this world and massive data.  most are drowning in it, take a ride on any public transport or stand in a waiting area.  People just stare into their magic black box&#39;s yet they have no idea that it&#39;s actually regressing their minds.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And while I agree that all this info is true, what I&#39;m seeing is links to article and studies which someone could say &quot;but that&#39;s from &quot;them&quot;. </p>

<p>So are &quot;they&quot; doing it or are we just naturally digressing because we are weak dopamine,  validation seeking, shortcut taking modern humans? ;) </p>
