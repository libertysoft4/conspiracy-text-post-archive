    <div class="md"><p>This idea is wearing thin over time. And the impatience is hilarious. </p>

<p>If there was no evidence would there already be 2 indictments and 2 guilty pleas? </p>

<p>What&#39;s yours thoughts about bannon? </p>

<p>Trump jr admitted to meeting Russian at trump tower.</p>

<p>The president is actively obstructing the investigation but it&#39;s really hard to prove that in court so it will probably just be perjury or something easier to prove like money laundering and tax evasion. </p>

<p>Trump has a pattern of setting up a fall guy and throwing them under the bus. So there&#39;s a small chance he comes out with out charges. Very small chance. </p>

<p>How many people around the president will have to be convicted before you believe he did something illegal? Is trump literally the only innocent person in his campaign and administration?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To claim that the Trump campaign/administration isn&#39;t dirty is obviously naive, and I wish everyone would get and acknowledge that. You cannot win a rigged game by playing fair. You also cannot win by letting people see your cards. I have no doubt T. Junior was looking for dirt on the Clintons, just as the Clintons were looking for dirt on everyone else. You&#39;d be stupid trying to run a &quot;clean campaign&quot; these days, as Bernie evidenced so clearly.</p>

<p>The admission of the meeting in turn (IIRC) confirmed that Trump Tower was being wiretapped during the campaign. Bishop takes pawn, rook takes the bishop. Both sides are playing a game, and both sides have sacrificed pawns in an attempt to win it. And I&#39;m not talking about 5D chess or anything like that either. It&#39;s just the game. It is what it is.</p>

<p>Bannon is just another chess piece. Maybe he did turn around, maybe his &quot;revelations&quot; are just more theatre setting up the next move on the board. I&#39;m erring towards the latter option, but who the hell knows.</p>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t clean by any means, but nobody at that level is. Bernie tried to be and came out looking like a pussy with a gash on his cheek at the convention. </p>

<p>The point at the of the day is, that Trump didn&#39;t win because of &quot;interference&quot; or &quot;collusion&quot;, since nothing worthy of that description has ever been shown to stick, but because enough people felt that it was time for a different crook to run the show. And you have to be a crook if you wanna run a mob (which is exactly what government is in its current form).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many people around the president will have to be convicted before you believe he did something illegal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to know what illegal something you&#39;re inferring in this, too, because I&#39;m yet to hear a meaningful answer to this. Opposition Research (T. Jr.)? Targeted campaigning (Cambridge Analytica)? Saying one thing during the campaign and then doing the opposite once elected (hiring Goldman Sachs types, etc.)? Doing exactly what he promised during the campaign (travel ban, The Wall, tax reform, etc.)?</p>

<p>All of these things are shady, dubious, and if you will detestable, but not at all illegal, am I wrong? Am I missing something? What does collusion mean to you? Because, I&#39;m not really seeing it.</p>
