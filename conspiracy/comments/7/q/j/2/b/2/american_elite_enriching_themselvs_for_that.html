        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Recent tax reforms, control over the gov to a point they can just change laws that go against majoroty vote(aka net nuetrality, which i think is yet another tactic they use to keep the public thinking about something other than gov and politics and wars. Basically, should have been a huge red flag when the banks were bailed out with no reprocussions, but hey, look at them now. Having given themselfs benificial tax reforms, that by future forcasts will absolutely thwart income, wealth, debt levels of any other class withing 20 years. All this, whilst looming automation. </p>

<p>Hey, did you know that a very select few own pretty much the entire stock market, and these are the same billionares that are enriching and automating their empires. Look at amazon, their employees are on POVERTY LINE. whilst the whole corporation and ceo are the greatest wealth holders in history. The whole thing is being automated. Thise workers are about to be replaced, wendys, macdonalds, walmart, entire shipping and delivery system is about to go drone(not only airlift, but autonomous vehicles). We are on the verge of the future of robotics in our lifetime. But the rich that hold most of the wealth that just gave selfs more money, are automating their empires. </p>

<p>This future is being built on the backs of all americans, but only select few profit. Good luck revolting america, your militarased police and anti terror units, will shut down any movement agains the gov, or the established system. USA, built on the backs of slaves(enternally?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the tax reforms as well as all of the corporate concessions deals like Foxconn are strategic plays to setup the US to be the heart and brain of the third industrial revolution, bringing about the age of automation.</p>

<p>Automation is happening no matter what, its better that it happens in a democratic country that has good intellectual property protection laws. </p>

<p>Op is right that if automation consolidates wealth further, it would lead to more inequality, however, automation is more good than it is bad if done right. No more driving, automated restaurants, and most importantly, new roles for people. In a post automation world creatives and critical thinkers will be in highest demand.</p>

<p>computer languages are more accessible now than ever before. companies will demand people learn technological skills, and people will have to learn.</p>

<p>btw, the tax cut incentivizes multinational companies to invest in building in the US versus other countries where tax rates are higher. Lower taxes are one of the few ways guaranteed to increase profits for big companies.</p>

<p>Next step in automation revolution: infrastructure</p>

<p>It makes logical sense that you need the necessary infrastructure to create the right environment for automation to thrive:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>roads for driverless cars and trucks</p></li>
<li><p>ports and airports for driverless boats and planes</p></li>
<li><p>excellent fiber connection everywhere</p></li>
<li><p>5G mobile network infrastructure</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Coincidence that Trump has been really pushing for infrastructure?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason to subscribe to that thought is the fact that there’s going to be a huge gap between automation and self-healing robots. Automation will be implemented much faster because we’re already starting to see it. The technology required for self-healing robots is decades away if I was to guess. So with that in mind I’d say getting a trade job or learning about PLCs would be a safe bet for awhile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind that the development of technology is not linear. The more progress you have already made, the more knowledge there is to draw on and the faster future progress will be. Example: it took us 125 years to go from the first hot air balloon, 40 years to go from the first airplanes to heavy bombers and passenger liners and 30 years to go from heavy bombers and passenger liners to supersonic Concordes and even rocketships. The road from here to the first AI is probably a lot shorter than the road from the first AI to the first self-sufficient AI.</p>

For a lot of us though given the whole &quot;limited lifespan&quot; thing, the least likely to be automated jobs are a nice safety blanket.

    <div class="md"><p>Automation is inevitable and is not something to be afraid of.  It is human nature to make technology to make things easier.  Blaming automation is ignoring the actual causes of wealth inequality.  You could just as well blame science for global warming because without science we wouldn’t have all this technology that enables global warming.</p>

<p>The real issue in our wealth inequality is that the masses don’t value their contributions to society and aren’t responsible for how their energy is used.  They enter into contracts that heavily favor the employer.  They elect politicians who serve the elite and not them.</p>

<p>There are two primary possibilities here.  The first is that humanity rises up and stops participating in systems that are incredibly biased against them, they instead participate only in systems that are fair to all parties involved.  Automation continues, but benefits us all.  The work week is continually reduced until eventually all work is done for pleasure and purpose not out of necessity.  The second possibility is that humanity continues to do nothing and they allow themselves to further be enslaved to the point that they can no longer escape and the elite can hold them down with brute force.</p>

<p>I don’t believe in the second option, as I don’t think we would choose to incarnate into a reality that had that distinct possibility.  I do believe that we can let this sink for a long ways and eventually hit rock bottom before we decide to take action and fix this nonsense.  We’re here to learn to take control of our reality and to create what we want to experience.</p>
