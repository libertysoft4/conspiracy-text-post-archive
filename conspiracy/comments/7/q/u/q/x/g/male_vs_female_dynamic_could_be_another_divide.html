    <div class="md"><p>Ya, its divide and conquer technique. I don&#39;t think anything is a coincidence anymore. If the media is constantly yapping about these male celebrities with the sexual harassment and the me too movement, and this stuff all kinda came out of nowhere too, then I think the powers that be definitely have a role in it. It was premeditated. Also I think society has done a good job beating up on men too. I&#39;m 18 years old and scared to death to talk to any girls, that can&#39;t be natural. I blame the powers that be for me being a cuck </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am hearing more and more that males are becoming fearful of interactions with females, even when only good intent is present. This is NOT the direction we need to go in as a society. At the same time, I am so fucking happy these issues with abuse of power and sexual harassment in the workplace are finally coming to light. As a woman, I ran into this shit heavily when working in the TV industry. It needs to be addressed.  But at the same time, the approach is getting really messy. The Aziz Ansari story for example is not so clear cut yet some feminist want there to be blame and have it placed solely on him. In reality, there is a deeper issue... that a culture still exists that tells women we need to be people pleasers, not step on toes, be amicable and that the attention we garner from men gives us value. Because of this, many women (every woman I personally know and myself) have found it difficult to navigate some social situations. I have made out with men I did not want to because I was afraid to hurt their feelings, and that’s really ridiculous. It’s not the man’s fault that I felt it was my only option. He was unaware that my desire to not hurt his feelings outweighed in my own desires or lack their of. And I am not responsible for the culture that taught me to put others before myself but once I recognized that, I knew I needed to work on some shit internally. </p>

<p>Often women find ourselves going along with more than we want in the name of keeping peace and being amicable. Some don’t want to hurt a man’s feelings by outright rejecting him by firmly saying no and walking away. But we need to work on reclaiming our power, because in doing so, it not only would help with these situations (for all parties involved) but also benefit many of us professionally and in everyday life. Problem is that many feminist factions see anything shy of putting 100% of the blame on the male as “victim shaming” and it’s not. We, men and women, are the product of our culture which we all internalize. Women often internalize behaviors and fears that don’t benefit us, the same as men do with what is often referred to as “toxic masculinity” (male ascribed behaviors that hurt males and females). If we work together and communicate without demonizing one another, we can overcome this. Some people want to portray Aziz as some monster and not just a pushy man, but that makes it appear less possible for women to state how they feel and leave in such situations where there is no threat to their safety or wellbeing to do so. Monsters are way more scary than just a person who’s needs in reality are no more important that your own.  </p>

<p>Don’t be afraid of interacting with women. Just keep in mind that communication is key to protecting both you and her. I do think this will settle out so long as we all keep our wits about us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many women have self reported that they don’t. It’s not an all or nothing matter, many shades of grey as to when any woman will assert her needs as opposed to other times. And in theory most women do believe their needs are as important as anyone else, but it’s in practice that many report putting their own wishes behind those of others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add, men report doing similar things in situations, not wanting to hurt a girl’s feelings. It’s reported less often by men in surveys on the matter, but it still happens to males as well. The only issue is, that men don’t seem to be “victimized” by it. In the case with Aziz Ansari. Grace felt victimized by her own decision under social pressure. And that’s a really bad direction to go in. I REALLY hope that line of thinking does not become a trend. Everybody just needs to own up to the decisions they make or adjust their line of thinking that lead them to make such decisions. It’s not someone else’s fault for our action or inaction. This isn’t Sophie’s Choice here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how big you are into conspiracy theories, I mean this is the conspiracy subreddit after all. but I think there&#39;s a massive effort by the richest bankers, corporatists, and politicians to lessen the world population massively, especially in the West. The first place you start is by stopping the younger generations (me) from making babies. So I think people with very bad intentions are inserting ideas into the culture like feminism and MGTOW and other things to keep men and women at odds with each other. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-millennials-less-sex-20160802-snap-story,amp.html">millenials </a> are having less and less sex. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/health/united-states-fertility-rate.amp.html">Fertility </a> rates are at a record low. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/07/31/539517210/sperm-counts-plummet-in-western-men-study-finds">Sperm</a> counts are at a record low. So along with the social aspect I think there&#39;s intended  physical consequences in men and women that cause us to be less fertile. It must have something to do with the contents in our food and drinks.</p>

<p>So all of this leads me to believe that society does not want me to be with women. I have internalized this message and that explains why I do not have the balls to approach a single girl and tell her I like her. I am scared to death of something that is so natural and so integral in the human experience, and it needs to change. I have to work on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t believe the millennial dare having less sex bullshit. It’s not tangibly possible with social norms having changed. I’m right at the cutoff point on the high end and all the millennials I know (all over the country) are having WAY more sex at that age than my age group ever did. Like, so much so I actually find it wildly shocking and slightly appalling... and I’m a “do what makes you happy” kind of person, lol. </p>

<p>I do believe the bad foods and plastics are probably intentionally chipping away at fertility. Which is fucking shitty. </p>

<p>But you can’t let them win and convince you not to talk to women. That’s nonsense, dude. Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and keep moving forward. I’m sure women would be delighted to talk to you. And you did just fine talking with me.  You got this. Practice makes perfect. </p>

<p>You can’t build it up too much in your head (btw: this is what a lot of women do which has them not speaking their mind, it’s the same thought process). But Girls are just people with the same boring bullshit that men have going on, just sacks of flesh with bones and organs, eating and breathing and sleeping like humans do. Nothing special. Nothing to get nervous about. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you envision human behavior as a collection of spectra, when you focus on a single spectrum of behavior you can see it swing over time.</p>

<p>Many people, when mentally imaging this 2D spectrum of behavior, put their attitude at the &quot;middle&quot; or point of lowest entropy in the spectrum. </p>

<p>Society, on the other hand, propels the pendulum in the direction of greatest influence, causing it to rise up to one side of the spectrum.</p>

<p>In this particular case, we are seeing a lot of support pushing the spectrum up the side of the &quot;we will not be taken advantage of any more&quot; behavior by those who have suffered from sexual power trips at the hands of their superiors.</p>

<p>This is further evidenced by the failure to call out Aziz, because his does not appear to have been a power trip, just a regular sexual encounter that someone regrets.</p>

<p>I fully expect the #metoo movement to continue to escalate until it reaches peak energy--the point at which the pendulum cannot rise any further--and then come racing down. It&#39;s very likely we&#39;ll see public opinion sway the other way briefly as the energy pushes the pendulum up the &quot;other side.&quot;</p>

<p>But that will be a function of where you put the point of lowest energy. Some people right now think the pendulum is at its peak, while others think it&#39;s just beginning to move up the spectrum.</p>

<p>uh, have you done any research on who funds modern feminist literature and political movements? And I&#39;m pretty sure the idea that most people under the age of 50 today are &quot;scared of sexual freedom&quot; can be dismissed out of hand. That&#39;s laughable.</p>

<p>a balance between feminine and masculine energy is an individual/internal psychological process, and why would you expect anything but a man tending somewhat more towards masculine and a woman towards feminine? &quot;Balance&quot; doesn&#39;t necessarily imply &quot;you have to be androgynous&quot; and just because non-hetero sexuality has historically existed in societies doesn&#39;t mean the rate of occurrence today isn&#39;t being artificially manipulated (it&#39;s really easy to say &quot;it&#39;s hormonal&quot; while ignoring the possible extent of influence by synthetic hormones in the environment of industrialized societies, btw)</p>

<p>Transgenderism is by definition not statistically &quot;normal&quot;, historically or otherwise - if it were, please explain how human populations would have maintained replacement-level birth rates. And none of this has any implied value-judgments about whether non-hetero people are &quot;good people&quot; or not, either, before you go down that road. </p>

<p>Care to explain what&#39;s inherently mas/fem? Artificially manipulated yes, but what&#39;s your point? The contrary exists too. You should do some research on what it means to be androgynous, and not this propaganda bullshit.</p>

<p>Uh &quot;transgenders&quot; have existed for a long time. Google it. Like I dont understand your point do you really think transgender and assumingly homosexuals would have that much of an impact of populations??</p>

<p>Also topics you can&#39;t comprehend isn&#39;t proof of the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, hogwash. Male / Female is a natural extension of sexual reproduction.</p>

<p>Humans have been social for a few thousand years, but sexual reproduction has been around for a billion years. It is completely understandable that we&#39;ve extended sexual reproduction into a binary social component.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re learning now, though, is that even though there may be a physiological difference between people of different biological sex, that doesn&#39;t mean they should be forced into some pre-defined social gender archetype.</p>

<p>Gender is flexible with society&#39;s interpretation and definition of it. Biological sex will always be what it is, regardless of whatever gender you associate with.</p>

<p>We should stop conflating the two. Your biological sex matters when you want to reproduce sexually. Your social gender matters when you want to integrate comfortably with society.</p>

<p>straight , gay , bi , metro , midi , hi-fi sexual , label that shit how ever you want but </p>

<p>men will always desire woman and vice versa ..</p>

<p>apart from the gays/lesbians,bi&#39;s w/e , they will do their thing and human nature will divide within a relationship thats multi sexual or a relationship involving more than one partner of same sex or gender , bitchiness and jealousy is something thats also a big part of human nature .. what i think is happening is someone at the top who may be gay / lesbian  , bi w/e has an interest in someone of either the same or other gender and wants to cause upset in a relationship.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are still real issues needing to be ironed out here but I have seen a lot of tactics to shut down any constructive dialogue that would help put to rest some of these male/female dynamic issues. Factions of the feminist movement want to put all fault and responsibility on men for these problems, and that’s really misguided and it robs women of their power to also affect change and improve their own lives. We could be working together on these problems, but instead we have been pitted against each other, so very little can be resolved, and divide and conquer tactic can be used as well. </p>

<p>That’s my take on it. I have had it come up a lot recently and it’s disheartening to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fastest way to destroy a society is through dividing the sexes.
Emasculating men whilst empowering women is another ploy of theirs, whilst we should be empowering women, emasculating men is unwise.  If it is your ambition to conquer a nation or a society, you weaken the strong, especially the strong males who would be inclined to do somnething about it. 
Look throughout schools, the mainstream media. Men are being actively encouraged to become feminized, when there are roles for the sexes, the society is structured; also when you take away peoples roles in society, they feel psychologically homeless, this can be confirmed through tribal identity in the human brain, this leads to a higher rate of depression in the society and those who are depressed are more docile than the rest of the population because they are sad and have given up. This could be down to coincidence, however, when the same gender wars are waging across borders, worldwide, they are certainly co-ordinated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah definitely. It coincides with ginormous inflation too. Look at housing costs, car costs, etc. Women started working and suddenly everyone was making more so everything went up because a dollar was worth less </p>

<p>I think we should go back to single working member of families. I just want that member to be less defined. Stay at home dad&#39;s or mom&#39;s. Whatever. Sometimes the woman just makes more money and has a better career. </p>

<p>Whatever toys a kid wants to play with. </p>

<p>Whatever. It all doesn&#39;t matter. We need to stop worrying about what others do I it literally doesn&#39;t effect us. But we definitely need to stop pushing daycare so much and make it possible for people to work with one provider again. Maybe then with someone home all the time we&#39;ll be able to have healthier homes again as someone has the time to prepare a healthy meal instead of grabbing the kid at daycare at 530 and getting home at 6 and needing to feed people in 15 minutes so you brown up some meat and add it to hamburger helper </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have thought similar things before. I will share some thoughts that maybe others will find interesting, hopefully start a conversation about. </p>

<p>If there were to be a mass revolt, revolution, etc. and it came to violence...it would mostly be fought by men, right? Sure women would play a role as well, but the bulk of the physical struggle would fall on the men. Tptb know this. But they also know what most men want. Sex and female attention. So I feel like society is designed to keep men chasing the approval/attention of women, so they have less time to think about society and form any kind of revolutionary movement. The women are conditioned to be more consumer driven. Go to any high end part of town. How many store fronts are appealing to a female market? Most of them. In fact you can google that women buy and consume and spend more money than men do. So if you appeal to the female mind and keep them wanting material things, social status, etc. then you have the men scrambling to keep up with the females wants and desires. Costing men time energy and resources. Of course there are exceptions. And maybe I’m an asshole for stating these observations, but I feel like there might be something there in the way society and marketing appeals to men and women differently in a way that keeps us in a constant futile cycle while we continue to let psychopaths at the top of the pyramid live a life most of us will never know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm interesting take. I think women inherently like to collect “things” more than men. So I think naturally there would be more store fronts catering to women. 
I totally agree that you could control the men with sex and female attention though. It controls a lot of my actions... </p>
