        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So since November 2017, 4 pornstars have died. </p>

<p>Olivia Nova - found dead in apartment - cause of death unconfirmed.</p>

<p>Shyla Stylez - - Died suddenly in her sleep at age 35.</p>

<p>August Ames - died from unknown reasons, rumoured suicide.</p>

<p>Yuri Beltran - Died from apparent overdose.</p>

<p>Now at first glance this could be gauged as coincidence but after seeing the narrative of some news articles, its made me think.</p>

<p>These articles have been talking about mental health and abuse of women in male led businesses. Now i feel this could be a narrative to appeal to left wings to try and get porn censored or banned altogether.</p>

<p>Anyone else have any input on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope porn gets banned...
I do not get why porn is not banned in the first place.</p>

<p>To get into your question, in my opinion most pornstars live a fucked up life. They do a lot of drugs/are addicted and the porn industry is very tough. I think that if you want to be a pornstar yourself, you either are not good in the head or you will get mental issues, because your family &amp; friends most likely won&#39;t accept it. </p>

<p>Furthermore, having sex all the time can not be good for your health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why I disagree with you even though I didn&#39;t down vote because you are entitled to you opinion...</p>

<p>For freedom to actually exist than it is necessary that consenting adults can do whatever they want, no matter how taboo or uncomfortable it makes society, porn included.  Unhealthy products and behavior must be protected. Otherwise questionable speech and one day soon, thoughts, will be banned for safety.</p>

<p>They simply must not infringe on people&#39;s rights to be left alone and not bothered. Just because something is done on poor taste in societies eyes ,it should never give someone else the authority to stop you. </p>

<p>If you do not have control over your body or what you decide to consume (drugs) then the hard fact is you are a slave because your freedom can be taken away with you locked in a cage like bad animal for decades simply because your slave master decided you can&#39;t do it. It makes a mockery of the &quot;free country&quot; mantra that supposedly exists in the US. Just my .02¢</p>

It should be free, BUT the truth about the effects of watching porn &amp; frequent masturbation must be known to the public. 
At the moment sites &amp; research are only telling us the benefits, which I think is not fair.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.spiritofmaat.com/archive/apr1/ankhing.htm">http://www.spiritofmaat.com/archive/apr1/ankhing.htm</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s a bunch of info on how sperm makes women happy and loss of vital energy from men after sex but I don&#39;t know what or if anything will satisfy your standards because they all seem like alt based info.  The Egyptian link is interesting. Have a good day too man, thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is more like their deaths are being exploited to fit an agenda that they are trying to push. August Ames was harassed by people for saying that she wouldn&#39;t do porn with a guy who has done gay porn due to diseases. The online harassment was so intense that she took her life (according to news articles). The problem with the internet right now is a self authority/mob rule where everyone thinks they are the police and can act on every emotion online. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they are trying to ban porn. It is something that could get the religious conservative vote though. But if I was running for congress, I would say that sex should be illegal even in marriage because of how outrageous it is and how everyone would want to listen to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a big contributor.  I think 1 hour bans should be allowed ant 30 day bans are kind of ludicrous as it gets the person out of the habit of the product itself and doesn&#39;t teach the behavior that it is bad.  People behave like a protestors online and when someone gets violent you pull them away from the group to remove its toxicity.  It is no different when someone sees a sensationalized article or anything else as they might go after the person&#39;s career or stuff like that because they believe that they are above the law or think the law won&#39;t do anything in those regards.  Online is no different in that they can get very toxic and harassing.  There needs to be the same method used during protests to protect the object of the protest so that there is peaceful assembly which I think may not exist online as I don&#39;t see very much a difference between breaking someone&#39;s leg and what some people do online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Porn is spiritual warfare. If tptb are nefarious I doubt they will ever ban it. Porn is an addictive drug that ruins families and lives. I am not a fan of censorship, but I equate porn to cigarettes; If it is so detrimental should it really be made so easily consumable under the guise of freedom of choice or non censorship?  </p>

<p>You would be hard pressed to find one US male between the ages of 13-20 that does not have a relationship with porn. This is a new development in human evolution and should not be taken lightly or ignored. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct but the accessibility and prevalence of porn has never been greater. It used to be relegated to magazines hidden between mattresses. Now it&#39;s literally accessible on the same instrument that you use to call your mom. This is
a very new development. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo this can&#39;t be true, porn is one of their greatest tools in terms of destroying the family unit. Because of porn young men(MGTOW) don&#39;t need women and because of feminism women believe they don&#39;t need men. I&#39;ve also read that porn is often on the forefront of technology, with things like VR becoming more and more prevalent on these sites that seems to be true. Degeneracy also seems to be an issue with transgenderism being deliberately pushed on some 4chan boards.  </p>

<p>Why would they be legalizing marijuana but at the same time be pushing to ban/censor porn? Both serve as opiates for the masses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re looking for a conspiracy based on these deaths, you could say that maybe there are porn stars who have dirt on certain powerful men and they could be killed to prevent them spilling the beans. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s also worth considering that porn stars are a high risk group of people. There&#39;s a lot of drug use and disease and general disfunction. The average lifespan of a porn star won&#39;t be as long as that of the general population on average. Sort of like how it&#39;s not surprising when you find out a professional wrestler has died at 50 or whatever.</p>

It&#39;s a matter of them remembering and choosing to come forth with the info. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Porn is one of those things that closes the horseshoe and makes it a ring. The far left believes that porn is inherently violent, misogynistic, and patriarchal. Women could never possibly choose to do it, therefore it is an avatar of victimization. The far right believes that it is evil, and a tool to tear apart families. They unite in their opinions, even though they arrive there on completely different roads. </p>
