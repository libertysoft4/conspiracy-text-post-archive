        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Obviously, like everything else of its kind, feminism is multifaceted: it cannot just be attributed to one type of people or to one cause. It started out as a way to give women more equality in society (i.e. granting them the right to vote). So this is not really a conspiracy, but some may claim it to be. I believe that capitalists have incorporated feminism into their agenda, and have been embracing it as a tool to further their cause. </p>

<p>The capitalist elite use radical liberalism (which encompasses 3rd wave feminism) as a tool to hang onto their power. They also use the right wing to sometimes keep radical liberalism in check, and create more left vs right conflict among people (even though both are 2 sides of the same coin: they are both puppets of the capitalists at the end of the day). They don&#39;t want the pitchforks aimed at them, so they create all this nonsense for people to focus on: alternative genders/toilets, race wars, gender wars, exaggerated foreign threats of terrorism (which they themselves create with their foreign policy), etc... So all of these dumb and divisive movements such as 3rd wave feminism, black lives matter, etc... are endorsed by the media. They want people to be focusing on these stupid stuff. They want people to be divided based on everything and anything possible: sex, gender, race, body type, religion, etc... They want everyone to be politically correct so if anyone questions anything or anyone they will be automatically shut down and unable to harm the status quo/the system. They want to destroy the family unit and make people individual economic units, slaves who work, they want women in the workforce, they want women to have more income so they can sell them more unnecessary crap. The more &quot;freedom&quot; there is, the more traditional norms/values are broken, the more the &quot;free market&quot; benefits: the more you can produce and sell to more people. </p>

<p>This is because the capitalist elites know that if people came together and stopped this nonsense, they would focus on the big issues such as the structurally broken social/political/economic system which is creating so much inequality, poverty, refugee crises, terrorism, war, starvation, etc.. and people would think of questions such as why are some lucky bastards born so unfairly rich and why do they own the government and write the laws? People, being sheep of course, easily got manipulated and fell for their tricks, which is why our society is so retarded today: the number 1 story on reddit, instead of being &quot;how can we change the structurally broken social/political/economic system which will benefit every single human on earth&quot; is &quot;an 11 year old girl lied about someone touching her hijab.&quot; Don&#39;t forget who owns the media. Fox news and CNN are both owned by the same type of morally bankrupt psychopaths who are working hand in hand. They don&#39;t give a flying fuck about &quot;left vs right&quot; nor do they have any ideology apart from maximizing their assets using whatever means possible, so it is just a puppet show for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Capitalist Elite will use everything they can to further capitalism and thus remain in power. I&#39;m sure they use feminism when it fits their agenda, but I don&#39;t think that feminism is their primary weapon, nor that furthering Capitalism is a main goal (or main side-effect) of feminism.</p>

<p>I think there are legitimate issues with gender imbalance throughout the world, and it&#39;s always better to address these issues and attempt to make all people of any gender feel equal and equivalent. They key is not falling into the trap set by the Elite, which makes people tear each other apart over such issues, instead of joining together to fight the Elite that maintain the systems that result in gender inequality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I agree with you, just to clarify, I did not say that feminism is their primary weapon. But perhaps today it is one of the most significant. They are jumping on stuff like #metoo and encouraging false sex accusations and the imprisonment of innocent men, just to maximize their own profits. They are true psychopaths. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean that you had claimed that. Appreciation the clarification since I was unclear.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important that people keep in mind that the Elite will try to undermine any attempt at dismantling any systemic structure that works to their benefit - in this case, they will try (or are trying) to undermine a movement like #MeToo, which - heaven forbid - might result in greater equality for women and between genders. Which, yes, could involve encouraging false accusations but will also involve trying to undermine legitimate complaints from women. Anything to keep people arguing and divided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a feminist myself, I do have to agree with you that the ideology has been used by TPTB to further their own plans that work against us as a whole. </p>

<p>I believe it’s likely that they were cool with and helped push women into the workforce to help hide the weakening of the dollar and destruction of the middle class. It’s also highly likely they wanted women in the work force so kids were pulled further away from their families and thus easier to indoctrinate. </p>

<p>There are reasons we still need feminism in first world countries, ones that I realize men are unaware of and through no fault of their own. There are things that we women need to be working on ourselves to better ourselves and thus society as a whole. For example, we need to learn our strength to say no in situations we find difficult and state how we feel despite fears of being deemed difficult (which I guess is the best way to put it into words). Many women have been raised to be “people pleasers” and not wanting to hurt other’s feelings, and do so to their own detriment. It’s a part of why women are less likely to ask for raises as compared to men, and it’s one component as to why women often end up making less than their male counterparts. Basically, there are a lot of less visible issues that need to still be addressed. And if these things get addressed, it would benefit both men and women (such as less ambiguity with sexual relations where women did not realize their strength to say no despite societal pressures learned gender roles). I often see problems with overcoming these issues because some factions of the feminist movement want to put the responsibility solely on men, and it’s just not that clear cut. Some feminist factions will shut down any constructive conversation if the focus is not soon men being solely responsible for these problems and such logic is not conducive to overcoming these issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much every single ideology/movement in history has been hijacked by selfish and manipulative people, because our overall system in modern times has always been politically/economically/socially broken. That is why I don&#39;t waste any time identifying with or furthering the cause of any single movement. For example, it makes no sense to push for feminism when the same feminists in the West are completely ok with and are doing nothing to stop the enslaving of 12 year old girls in Bangladesh inside sweatshops. Until the core toxic ideologies of capitalism + competing nation-states led by a oligarchs or dictators are addressed, no significant change will ever happen in the world. So I think it is counterproductive to willingly conform and contribute to such a system and then join a mini-cause within it which only aims to benefit one segment of the population. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s why i don’t do any organizations and stay away from associations/foundations and charities that aren’t small enough that I can’t personally see most of what is going on (basically, I do help some local small charities through donation of my time and efforts, one being a battered women’s shelter and the other being a soup kitchen). I don’t personally push for feminism or work in any organization that does so. But I do on a personal level work to help women overcome issues that relate to feminism on a fundamental level. These challenges are of a cultural nature and cannot be fixed through legislation. But in fixing many of these issues, it directly benefits both men and women. And when the end result does that, it’s work worth doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt it. Some of us have no issue saying no and we don’t think twice about it and we are still nurturers and willing to sacrifice our needs for others, but only in situations that actually matter. From what I have heard from other women, it really does seem to be socialized into us, not innate.

    <div class="md"><p>Feminism is a great thing, even though it has been coopted by the elites far too often.  Feminism, like any other emancipatory or egalitarian movement, is a threat to the elites&#39; power.  That&#39;s part of why it gets targeted so heavily by them , both attacks and attempts to coopt.  Its important to differentiate between attempts to actually materially empower women, and claims of #feminism that merely cloak the same sort of corporate exploitation as ever.  This latter phenomenon is one of the elite&#39;s most effective tools for attacking feminism, as it diverts feminists away from their actual goals, and also makes it easier to maliciously mischaracterize feminism and its goals in the massive, never ending smear campaign against it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if that was their intended effect they failed big time, because feminism has entered mainstream thinking. If anyone says anything that is not compatible with radical 3rd wave feminism, they will lose their job and me labeled a misogynist. So I think the elites want feminism to prevail. They want to pacify males because they see males as more of a threat: they know that even with power, women will be less of a threat to them, so they want to give women all the jobs and high positions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re massively overstating the power of feminism if that&#39;s what you think.  I wish we could live in a world that even just approached that.</p>

<p>As to your later point, its important to keep in mind that the elite, however you define it, is predominantly male.  They&#39;ve got far more wealth and far more hereditary and societal power given to them.  If women got all the jobs and high positions there&#39;d still be an absolute ton of problems and issues and such, but it&#39;d at least wipe out TPTB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My source is common sense. Most rape victims are male. Have you seen what happens in prison? Most prisoners are male. Men have a 4x higher suicide rate. Men are not allowed to show emotions. Men must be strong and masculine. Men must fight or be called a pussy. Men must make money. Men must do the heavy physical labour. Men must now do the housework and child raising too. The top 20% of men get the top 80% of women, and the bottom 80% of men (the majority of men) have to fight it out for the lowest 20% of women. Women get into competitive education programs and jobs easier thanks to reverse discrimination. The education system is designed for the female, and normal male behaviour is met with mandatory diagnoses of ADHD. Men are expected to give their seats to women and hold doors for women. Men are under pressure to fix their hair, beard, have amazing clothes, etc... just to fight to get a girl who is uglier than themselves, while even an ugly girl with poor hygiene will have 100s of men battling it out for her.  </p>

<p>Basically, feminism has resulted in women keeping all of their advantages afforded under patriarchy, women getting a bunch of new advantages, while men&#39;s advantages have been stripped from them, and they have been given no new advantages. That is what feminism has become: an oppressive system that benefits one side while oppressing the other side. Unfortunately, it has become mainstream, so ANY dissent or opposing voice will AUTOMATICALLY be met with an iron fist: absolute societal death for the dissenter (this was the punishment that early human tribes used on people who committed murder). </p>

<p>I have my own eyes and ears and brain. I don&#39;t need the horseshit capitalist owned &quot;news&quot; to tell me anything, even though I am well aware of current events. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Men have kept most of their advantages, while gaining plenty of new ones - sexual freedom, the right to show emotions, the ability to be a stay at home parent or to keep the kids in a divorce...  A lot of those and other advances for men have only come because of the feminist push for gender equality, both legally and socially.</p>

<p>There are lots of non-capitalist, non corporate-owned media sources out there.  I&#39;d encourage you to check them out. (BTW, reddit is not one of them) I agree the MSM is awful, but if you&#39;re shutting yourself off to anything beyond your own senses you&#39;ll have an extremely limited view of the world.  That sees to be exactly what&#39;s happended here, as you take a lot of things that have happened a few times, or are now more theoretically possible in certain circumstances, mixing them and build those up into being What Is Happening Everywhere, All The Time, In The Most Extreme Way Imaginable, Solely Due To Feminism And Nothing Else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Men have kept sexual freedom, but this is nullified by women gaining sexual freedom. When women gain sexual freedom, men become oppress because the 80/20 rule kicks into effect... which is precisely WHY sexual freedom was limited for women. In order for things to be fair for all, women cannot be granted too much sexual freedom. So men have LOST in this regard.</p>

<p>The right to show emotions? Wrong. Men are still expected to withhold emotions.</p>

<p>To be a stay at home parent? Wrong. Men never had a choice: they are always expected to work. It is women who have the choice to work or be a stay at home mom. </p>

<p>Right to keep the kids in a divorce? If anything this has got worse for men: men have no right, in fact some women have children just so they can divorce and receive free money in terms of child support, which they mainly use on themselves.</p>

<p>No cult gets me. I am not an imbecile. I choose which subreddits to participate in and when, and I do not completely share the ideals of any one &quot;cult&quot; or group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean that you had claimed that. Appreciation the clarification since I was unclear.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important that people keep in mind that the Elite will try to undermine any attempt at dismantling any systemic structure that works to their benefit - in this case, they will try (or are trying) to undermine a movement like #MeToo, which - heaven forbid - might result in greater equality for women and between genders. Which, yes, could involve encouraging false accusations but will also involve trying to undermine legitimate complaints from women. Anything to keep people arguing and divided.</p>
