    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, it’s hive mind at its finest. This isn’t exclusively a Reddit thing though. While sometimes it’s a fallacy, sometimes the truth really is in the middle. All vaccines are not bad or evil, the science itself is quite sound. However, they downplay the shit out of the legitimate cases of  vaccine injury, and the lack of accountability in the industry, and ineffective vaccination rates with some of them. There are certainly some case of foulness abound , but to the masses, it’s never “their” Doctor that’s part of the corrupt medical industry. Only other, bad doctors care more for profit than peoples. Sometimes, they’re correct. Other times....well... </p>

<p>Yeah, anti-vaxers will scream <em>shill!</em> and run through the talking points they learned on Facebook or YouTube. But the epidemiologists, virologists, and immunologists who actually study the issue firsthand <em>overwhelmingly</em> support vaccination. There&#39;s a reason for that, and it&#39;s not that every expert in the world is corrupt. Vaccines actually work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not fighting the deadliest diseases when given a vaccine. You&#39;re fighting their retarded cousins. We have a whole slew of different types of vaccines (live attenuated, inactivated, toxoid, subunit, conjugate, VLPs, DNA, recombinant etc.) and none of them have you fighting the actual pathogen. They&#39;re either weakened to the point where they can&#39;t do much, or you&#39;re given a LITERAL piece of them that can&#39;t replicate by itself. They are sitting ducks against your immune system. An APC will stimulate the formation of memory T and B cells geared towards fighting whatever has the antigen the APC picked up.

<p>At this point, I feel my own perspective is not being conveyed and is getting twisted a bit so I&#39;ll just say, I don&#39;t think vaccines are a conspiracy to kill people or anything like that–– I just sometimes wonder if cocktails should be given to small children all at the same time. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Key word &quot;some people&quot;. The amount of individuals that suffer even slight side effects is incredibly low (this does vary from vaccine to vaccine). You can never guarantee 100% risk free in all cases. People are different. Certain individuals may react differently to certain antigens when compared to the general population. Some individuals could have some degree of immunodeficiency and struggle to take down vaccines involving a live virus (usually these people are not administered the vaccine though). These are still fringe cases though.</p>

<p>You&#39;re question is completely fine. Children do have a less developed immune system when compared to adults. However by the same vein of logic, you could argue that they SHOULD be the priority since they would be the most at risk. It&#39;s all about balancing the risks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you wanted to space them out, 6 months would be overdoing it I would think. B cells begin producing antibodies at around 5-7 days after the addition of the antigen, and the T cells are already out there. </p>

<p>The longer you wait the longer you&#39;d be susceptible. Keep in mind that the intensity of an immune response to an already encountered antigen is not only MUCH faster, but significantly more intense than the first encounter. </p>

<p>If you want you could always ask your doctor or a practicing immunologist. They&#39;ve been dealing with this stuff for literally decades. </p>

<p>No problem. The sad reality is that the public view of vaccines has become tainted in the past 25ish years. Tones of studies have come out showing their safety and beneficial effects, but they don&#39;t ever reach the masses. It&#39;s starting to have negative effects. Certain diseases are beginning to rear their heads.</p>

<p>The real issue though is that nobody bothers to read the actual scientific literature in general. It&#39;s all about blogs, news articles and shitty 30 second video summaries on social media. They rarely ever properly portray what was found out and often twist stories to sound more &quot;clickbaity&quot; or to better suit their political affiliation. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the real conspiracy if you ask me. Having people think they&#39;ve got a handle on a whole subject because they read an article on &quot;NaturalHealthNewsToday&quot; or whatever. ALWAYS check the references and find out where the information is coming from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure where that information came from, but herd immunity is a bit different than that. It basically amounts to having a sufficiently immunised group of people, which makes disease harder to spread, therefore limiting contact with the subgroup of non-immune individuals. It&#39;s especially relevant to vaccines. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be happy to back this up with sources but I&#39;m on mobile, so I&#39;d appreciate it if you google &quot;herd immunity&quot; first before you ask me to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, herd immunity is exactly how i explained it.  big pharma has attempted to hijack the term by leaving out the &quot;natural&quot; part that is so important to its definition though.</p>

<p>As more people in a society develop NATURAL immunities less people in the society will be born with the susceptibility of contracting deadly illness since tolerance/immunity is passed down <em>genetically</em>.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Herd immunity (also called herd effect, communityimmunity, population immunity, or social immunity) is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a large percentage of a population has <strong>become immune</strong> to an infection, thereby providing a measure of protection for individuals who are not ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>nothing in the definition describes vaccinations and although vaccines do provide a sort of immunity it is an unnatural form.  It works, but it does not have the effect herd immunity was coined to describe.  Children are not born immune to polio or the chicken pox because mom and dad were vaccinated for it.  They need to be vaccinated too since the immunity is not genetically passed down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The risk to everyone of developing very serious complications from the illnesses we vaccinate against, are increased when herd immunity goes down.

<p>Containment meant isolation of patient and vaccination of those who were in contact with them.</p>

<p>Isolation in a separate dwelling while being cared for by someone who previously had the disease is noted as being particularly effective.</p>

<p>Clearly a lot of vaccination happened and the disease was eradicated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gee, I&#39;ve had the flu shot every year for about 10 years now and I haven&#39;t gotten the flu, either. So here&#39;s to getting my vaccine and never having the flu! </p>

<p>You seem to think the flu is the worse thing that can happen to you? Ever seen a kid with whooping cough? Ever seen someone suffer from shingles? Any of your older relatives contract polio as a child? Ever known anyone who had to endure treatment for hepatitis? I&#39;ve seen all those things, and I don&#39;t want them for myself or my children. You can have them! I&#39;ll get the vaccines, thanks.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s the problem.  Once eradicated these things are no longer scary because there is no first hand experience and folks then get it in their heads that it&#39;s a bad thing because their snowflakes might get autism (/s) and it spreads virally and now we have new cases of these once tamped down diseases.</p>

<p>So hopefully when a bunch of people die this time, the lesson is learned for a few more decades into the future but, I&#39;m not counting on anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every single medicine can have serious side effects. Even antibiotics and vitamin supplements. If there question was, &quot;Are there potential harmful side effects?&quot;, then we&#39;d never set a bone or give penicillin or use vaccines or car seats.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we ask instead how common the side effects are, and whether the benefits outweigh the potential harms, given their scarcity. And every expert in the field agrees that the benefits of vaccines far outweigh the potential, and vanishingly rare, side effects. Just like with penicillin.</p>
