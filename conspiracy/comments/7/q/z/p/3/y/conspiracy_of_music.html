        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I suspect music itself is a tool of brainwashing and indoctrination. I don’t know how it was in the past, certainly music in the time of Beethoven was different, but since the 60’s when the music revolution happened, all new forms of music came out like rock &amp; roll, jazz, pop, you name it, I think since then a lot of things changed.</p>

<p>Modern music has definitely psychological effect, it can shape the mood of a person, it can induce the mood of the person, and it can shape the personality of the person.</p>

<p>It’s psychological effects are severely underrated, even by conspiracy theorists.</p>

<ul>
<li>On one hand it makes people very emotional and irrational, makes them <strong>feel</strong> things instead of <strong>thinking</strong> about then. It makes your worldview emotion based instead of logic based.</li>
<li>On the other hand, I suspect modern music, especially electronic music, literally induces hypnotic reactions in people, all these electronic sound effects are very hypnotizing, and then once you induce hypnotic states in people, you can brainwash them with several agendas.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was already revealed that the TV’s 60 Hz or what was it, frequency, induces hypnotic states in them, so it’s no secret that the TV is a brainwashing tool.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whydontyoutrythis.com/2013/08/440hz-music-conspiracy-to-detune-good-vibrations-from-natural-432hz.html?m=1">Some people claimed that 440 Hz music which was the default frequency of the .mp3 format, also induces similar reactions.</a></p>

<p>But it’s not just that the frequency makes people “psychologically vulnerable”, it’s that the entire music itself is almost like an addiction, and in this vulnerable state when you are listening to music, it creates emotions in you, depending on the type of the music. On the other hand the lyrics can be manipulated to push an agenda.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the 3 main music types that are in competition today, I will ignore pop music because it’s usually having trashy nonsense lyrics, mostly about teenager issues, so that’s kind of normal. But I will describe the other 3 main music genres.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Electronic Music</h1>

<p>I have already talked about this here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7nw0ef/globalist_hypnotic_brainwashing_via_music/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7nw0ef/globalist_hypnotic_brainwashing_via_music/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It has a very hypnotizing rhythm, and it’s the most popular music genre nowadays even phasing out pop music. The brainwashing effect is obvious, at the bare minimum it makes people overly emotional and docile, but it’s worse actually.</p>

<p>If you look at any video-clip of any EM producer, you can see that the party agenda is being pushed. In every music video you see people there smoking, drinking, doing drugs, and eating fast-food. It’s clearly pushing an unhealthy lifestyle agenda.</p>

<p>I read the newspaper 2 kids have died yesterday of alcohol overdose as they drank themselves to death at a drinking game in a nearby club. And one of the largest causes of death today in the world are lung cancer (smoking) and liver cancer (drinking). It’s clearly a bad thing being pushed.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom">“torches of freedom”</a> agenda that master propagandist Edward Bernays was pushing. Same thing is pushed in these videoclips.</p>

<p>But it’s actually worse, if you analyze the lyrics, it’s full of “let’s unite the world” , “we are one world” , “make the world one” references to a Global Government.</p>

<p>It’s clearly a propaganda operation to push for a Global Government, while the docile kids are just bombarded with unhealthy behavior and their rational brains are fried. It incentivizes irrational behavior and ultra-emotionalism.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Rap Music</h1>

<p>I don’t even have to describe this one, everyone knows what’s this all about. In the US it’s clear, it makes African-Americans drug addicted thugs, promotes racism, and traps them in poverty and gangster mentality.</p>

<p>Secondly it promotes drug use, while being illegal, so no coincidence that the US prison population is extreme, and mostly filled with blacks.</p>

<p>But it’s not just in the US, and not just blacks. While it originated there, you can clearly see it in Europe too, the same mentality being pushed on whites in some shady neighborhoods.</p>

<p>I used to live in a city before I moved to the suburbs and there were zones filled with thugs and hooligans listening to this crap all day. I don’t know nowadays but about 10-15 years ago it was a thing.</p>

<p>Certain shady nightclubs promoted this culture and of course they did drugs there too, just pushing the addiction mentality. My wife’s ex boyfriend was a drug addicted loser, he beat my wife once, he was a violent thug and he did heavy drugs and listened to this “gangsta music” shit.</p>

<p>It promotes this lowlife mentality, and I suspect the music itself brings out the emotions in one person to become a thug, the music creates the personality of the thug.</p>

<p>Of course the lyrics are very dirty as well, constantly filled with references to violence, supremacy, gang loyalty, and incitement for crime. It’s almost like a recruitment method for gangsters.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Metal/Rock Music</h1>

<p>Metal is even worse than Rap music. Since it has a rebellious extremist element in it. And I heavily suspect this Metal culture fuels the 2 extremist movements we see today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Communist agitators</li>
<li>Neo-Nazis</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s no secret that Punk Rock is the favorite music genre of these hooligan communist agitators that go out into the street and smash windows and set cars on fire. It has that element of rebellion in them, and combine that with loser 20 year old who lives in their mother’s basement who were exploited 12 years in the school system only to have a worthless bachelor’s degree and no job prospects.</p>

<p>It doesn’t take a lot to make these kinds of people participate in these violent riots, since they have nothing better to do with their lives, and the music ignites this behavior in their psyche.</p>

<p>But worse, there is another side to Metal, one which promotes Neo-Nazism, not overtly, but the elements are remarcably obvious.</p>

<p>I remember I was at a concert one time, it was a metal concert and the singer constantly singed about militaristic themed music, about wars and soldiers and glory and stuff like that. Interestingly the band was German origin, I don’t remember their names though.</p>

<p>Just take a look at what Germanic metal bands sing about, you’d be shocked to find out.</p>

<p>There are even metal bands that made song about WW2, which Neo-Nazis love to use in their “Hitler Tribute” videos on Youtube as background songs.</p>

<p>Of course the bands will deny their promotion of Nazism, and they might be against the Nazis, however their music is still promoting it unconsciously.</p>

<p>So when you look at these Alt-Right White Supremacists and Neo-Nazis, just check what music there are listening to, and see whether there is a correlation there.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>So it looks like the 3 major genres out there promote 3 different types of behavior. We know the TPTB are not unified, so there might be multiple factions in the Elite. Each faction pushing their agenda through their music genre of choice.</p>

<p>The most popular is the Electronic Music today, which I fear, since it literally pushes this Globalist One World Government Technocracy.</p>

<p>It’s just so trendy, just put a smart speaker in your home so that you can listen to some EM all day, use your smart-phone all day, make sure your smart-TV is on as well. It’s just so trendy, and make sure you drink a lot of alcohol and eat fast-food while at it, it’s just amazing!</p>

<p>I mean this is literally what we are exposed to, this is the culture that music is fueling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Music is Magick. Magick is the manifestation of ones Will into Reality. Music creates thoughts and emotions in ones mind, in millions of minds, that otherwise may never have been. It is incredibly powerful, and all music, going as far back in time as man has known it (we have 30k y/o bone pipes) has had a spiritual/psychological aspect to it. You are right on the money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s because Magick is quite a ways down the rabbit hole, and there are a lot of prerequisite thoughts and ideas one must look into before they ever get to it.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m totally biased as i work in the production end of the industry. </p>

<p>So i&#39;m not going to bother getting into your points as it would just be me refuting and you coming back and nobody has time for roundabouts. </p>

<p>However i wanted to specifically ask you about the 300hz mp3 frequency claim. </p>

<p>As a 20 odd year engineer, i have never heard this before and i&#39;m wondering what you&#39;re talking about?  </p>

<p>An mp3 is a compression algorithm that removes frequency areas that are outside of human hearing. It removes the frequency range that you &#39;feel&#39;. The lower the quality of the mp3, the larger this frequency range becomes. </p>

<p>I can analyse any commercially released mp3 and unless somebody (for god knows what reason) inserted a 300hz tone, nothing would show up. </p>

<p>There is even a scientific text you can do. </p>

<ol>
<li>take a commercial recording in wav format.</li>
<li>Convert it to 320kps (or whatever bit rate you prefer)</li>
<li>Import both files into an audio sequencer</li>
<li>Invert the phase of one of the files.</li>
<li>The resulting noise is the difference between the 2 files.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can then analyse this &#39;noise&#39; for weirdness in the 300hz frequency.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look I am not an expert on frequencies, some guy claimed it here that certain frequencies in .mp3 music were stimulating. </p>

<p>But the frequency manipulation is real though, you can do a quick search and find out how real the frequency warfare is.</p>

<p>EDIT I FOUND IT ! It&#39;s actually 440 hz not 300 MHZ, sorry about that:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, thats something totally different that you&#39;re talking about. That&#39;s instrument tuning. </p>

<p>That arose because we had no agreed upon standardised tuning. One orchestra could play a piece at a 376 tuning, while another in a different part of the world could play it tuned over the 500hz mark. </p>

<p>The frequency chosen may well be a point of contention for some but the reasons for needing a standard, were real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that music does have a psychological effect and neurological effect. Read up on how synapses firing and pathways when hesring jazz and classical. I don&#39;t agree, though, that it can produce a sort of Manchurian Candidate effect on people like you seem to be suggesting. You aren&#39;t going tomlisten to Mayhem and then go out and burn down a church, or hear Springsteen and then in some music induced trance move to Jersey and get a blue collar job. N.W.A. wasn&#39;t created to turn the black youth into &quot;thugs.&quot; They were holding a mirror up to the lives of poverty they had been pushed into living by being crestive and expressing themselves to their full capabilities. It isn&#39;t magic(k) has some want to argue. It is simply &quot;magic&quot; in the sense that it is art and art is beautiful and &quot;magic.&quot; And, yes, yes there is a lot of shitty art/music out there.</p>

Especially in the current landscape when a person can find and listen to the most obscure band right on the tiny computer in their pockets. There are over 97 million officially released songs and that’s only the tip of the iceberg. So maybe a few of the most popular pop rap and hip hop songs are using some sort of mind control but to insinuate that all produced music is a mind control tool is a bit outrageous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you might want to check out masoru emotos studies <a href="http://hado.com/ihm/water-crystals/">http://hado.com/ihm/water-crystals/</a> . If you do i suggest starting with his book called &quot;the hidden messages in water&quot;.</p>

<p>The TLDR of it is he freezes water from different places after saying positive or negative words to it, or playing different types of music etc. then photographs the crystals that form. Positivity makes beautiful crystals whilst negativity wont even make crystals IIRC. And considering the fact that humans are 70% water it makes for compelling reading.</p>

<p>People have very low standards nowadays, literally anything goes. They are feeding most people from their hands, it&#39;s not hard to condition music to fit their agenda.</p>

<p>For example, a couple of artists I&#39;ve been listening to lately are Summer Salt and Cuco, I don&#39;t think their lyrics are &quot;enlightening&quot; in any way but they&#39;re a bit different than the usual so I&#39;m really enjoying them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interestingly I don&#39;t think pop music has gotten any worse than it ever was.</p>

<p>American Pop always had a trashy side to it, I prefered British musicians though in my childhood.</p>

<p>A-Pop always had a very consumerist vibe, in every videoclip they were drunk and smoking. It just doesn&#39;t feel right with me, never did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that music does have a psychological effect and neurological effect. Read up on how synapses firing and pathways when hesring jazz and classical. I don&#39;t agree, though, that it can produce a sort of Manchurian Candidate effect on people like you seem to be suggesting. You aren&#39;t going tomlisten to Mayhem and then go out and burn down a church, or hear Springsteen and then in some music induced trance move to Jersey and get a blue collar job. N.W.A. wasn&#39;t created to turn the black youth into &quot;thugs.&quot; They were holding a mirror up to the lives of poverty they had been pushed into living by being crestive and expressing themselves to their full capabilities. It isn&#39;t magic(k) has some want to argue. It is simply &quot;magic&quot; in the sense that it is art and art is beautiful and &quot;magic.&quot; And, yes, yes there is a lot of shitty art/music out there.</p>
