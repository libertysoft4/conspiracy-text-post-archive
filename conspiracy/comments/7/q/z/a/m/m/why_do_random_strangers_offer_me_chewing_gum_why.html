        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I find it really strange and puzzling. It hasn&#39;t happened in a while, but I used to be riding the subway for example and some random stranger offered me chewing gum, no words exchanged. It happened several times in different places. I think only one time the stranger talked to me, and he offered me chewing gum. He looked very much like Putin btw. Wtf? I have to add that one day I took a ride in a taxi cab and the driver, a complete stranger, told me out of the blue that I had been poisoned! I didn&#39;t tell him about the chewing gum so I have no idea why did he say that or what was he referring to or who could have poisoned me or if he was some crazy guy or a joker. What&#39;s going on?!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a strange experience one day with a homeless person who asked for a light. I went into a store we were by and picked him up a small bic to have. He then proceeded to act &quot;wild&quot;/&quot;end is near&quot; crazy and then breaking character to look me in the eye and say, &quot;sorry man&quot; in a very calm and collected voice. It was strange but I assume he had turrets or something. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ow8Ci3EmBM">Life is strange sometime</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ummm.... no, I didn&#39;t have auditory hallucinations, the cab driver did tell me that. And I don&#39;t take hallucinogens. What you are letting me know is that what he told me was so strange that you rather believe I had hallucinations rather than believe me that he told me that. Sigh. I was wishing for responses from conspiracy theorists that could illuminate the issue a bit, not from people who call conspiracy theorists crazy. Thanks anyway. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t calling you crazy. I was asking if there was a possibility that you were experiencing a hallucination. I&#39;ve experienced hallucinations, it&#39;s not a big deal. I wanted to ask before we went straight into whether you had pissed off a government agency or the Freemasons. Masons love to do things like this to fuck with people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess like a lot of the others is that you have very bad breath. It would explain strangers offering you gum to mask the smell and also the cab driver remarking you have been poisoned because even from the front seat your breath smelled like you were dying inside. Now, I&#39;m not trying to make fun and I&#39;m sure you think your breath is fine, but, unfortunately, most anyone with that level of eye wateringly bad hot breath don&#39;t realize they have. Perhaps find someone you know to be honest and ask them. Really bad breath can be a sign of internal problems and illness. Be safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, at least your argument sounds more logical. But the issue is that those strangers couldn&#39;t smell my breath because I had my mouth shut and at least one of them was sitting in front of me her back facing me and she turned and offered me the chewing gum. I have smelled people bad breath before, but always when they are talking to me, and never when they have their mouth shut. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yah well if you were exhaling through your nose it would still smell bad.</p>

<p>Were you breathing when these people offered you gum? If you were breathing at all - your breath must be super bad. Chew your own gum so people don&#39;t have to offer it to you.</p>

<p>Now that you know you have this problem, it&#39;s almost rude not to take care of it yourself without needing to be asked by random people to chew gum.</p>

<p>Floss and chew gum.</p>
