<p>How is it possible that a person who works in the White House has such poor opsec that they would even have a spying device like that in their home and then advertise that fact to the world?</p>

<p>Is this a conspiracy to leak sensitive info through sheer stupidity or what?</p>

<p>How long before Bezos is using shit said by ignorant govt officials for nefarious purposes? Or even &quot;better&quot;, how long before Chinese or Russian hackers have an open mic in her house 😂</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t the deep state supposedly after Trump? Why would anyone working that high up in his WH be allowed such a device, even at home? People who work with classified or sensitive info are taught better opsec arent they? For some clearances i know they have to take polygraphs and be evaluated regularly. Wouldnt &quot;hey do you have IoT spying devices bugging your place of residence&quot; be a good question?</p>

<p>Edit: why isnt everyone who works in the Whitehouse using Boeing Blacks? <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Black">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Black</a></p>

<ol>
<li>If the cia is going to spy on her its going to spy on her</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone high up enough for top ppl to spy on them isnt safe anyway. She has a cell phone. Thats even worse. Shes also followed by reporters and camera crews</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes its stupid. Amazon echo is a waste of money even if it was safe. Are you really so lazy you can&#39;t type amazon.com into the search bar? You can&#39;t pull your phone out of your pocket check whatever you need to  check?</li>

<p>The secure network is called the sipr. It requires certain security measures. </p>

<p>The have an encrypted phone and that&#39;s about it. They probably can VPN in but that&#39;s probably only through a specific laptop as different classification levels have different storage requirements for the actual storage device </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously, the idea of &quot;secured&quot; networks is pretty far-fetched in this day and age, but is it not reasonable to assume that governments CAN protect their own officials? I&#39;m no computer geek, but it would seem a little obvious that certain workers are required to follow security protocol when accessing the internet, from anywhere. Example: Hillary Clinton used a private email server, breaking the rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the west wing does a good job at showing this. Sometimes they&#39;re flat out lied to. Sometimes they&#39;re told the truth so they can spin better </p>

<p>They do have a security clearance but they&#39;re not national security so there isn&#39;t always a need to know which is generally supposed to be a requirement and has been more heavily enforced since Manning and Snowden just trolled through entire areas they had no legitimate need to know and thus shouldn&#39;t have even had access. </p>

<p>Plus there&#39;s tons of people with security clearance in the military that never actually access classified information. Those things are handed out like candy to any 18 year old high school graduate. You could go an entire 6 year enlistment and never have a need to know something so never access a classified document </p>

<p>Security clearances are really just indicative of the depth of the background check</p>

<p>For my secret they didn&#39;t even go talk to my references in person. For my ts people were interviewed multiple times. They don&#39;t even polygraph you unless you&#39;re in intelligence I didnt get one until a specific assignment </p>
