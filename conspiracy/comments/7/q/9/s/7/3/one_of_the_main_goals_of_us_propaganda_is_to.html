    <div class="md"><p>I am an American expat in SE Asia. I have traveled extensively to a variety of locations with Afghanistan,  Cambodia, and the Philippines being some of the most intimidating places visited in recent years. I generally felt safer in these locations than I would in most American urban centers <em>and</em> their suburban extensions. </p>

<p>This includes a comparison to Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan, Southern Mindanao/Qezon City and Tondo in Metro Manila, and the Poipet/Phnom Penh areas of Cambodia.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, these locations are far from perfect. However, some of the nations that easily surpass the US in gun violence are mostly Central American/South American countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he’s right, take Mexico for example. Never heard a good thing mentioned in the media about it. Nothing but drug cartels, ms 13 type gangs, the army guy getting arrested by crossing the border. 
Mexico has some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. It has a few areas you need to stay away from, but America has hundreds of cities your should stay away from.<br/>
There is a lot of fear pushed by the media, I think most would agree with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao you guys are crazy. Have you ever been to Mexico? I live about 10 min from the border. Ive been to Tijuana, Mexicali, Rosarito/Puerto, La Paz, tecate, valle de guadalupe, San Felipe, ect. I live on the Tijuana border and traveled to the farthest point in Cabo. Mexico is an amazing country and your right there are very friendly people and beautiful cities. Playing down the problems with the infrastructure and corrupt law enforcement/government is doing no one any favors. Mexico has some real issues and it can be an extremely dangerous. There is no government conspiracy to keep us out of Mexico guys what would even be the reason for that! I don’t think theres any unfair propaganda about conditions in Mexico. The crime and violence especially along the border cities is very real and oh so bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the places you listed I wouldn’t go either. But to be fair, let’s list ours.. Chicago, Oakland, Detroit, St Luis, Memphis, Atlanta, Stockton, Cleveland...the list goes on. I personally would take my chances in Cabo then any of these American cities any day. And while we both know Cabo is probably the safest on your list. Staying away from boarder towns in Mexico is a no brainer. Also not a clear depiction at all of Mexico, and those towns don’t represent them as a country. Just like Cleveland isn’t what America is like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would go to the places I listed in Mexico..... I mean I have and I would again. That wasn’t my point. Downplaying the real problems Mexico is having with drug cartels, infrastructure, and corruption is not helping anyone. Not the tourists and not the Mexican citizens. You cant compare the violence in American cities to the issues in Mexico. Its not comparable. I would also visit any city on your “American list to be avoided” in a heartbeat. Cleveland isn’t what americas like? You put Chicago on the list? Come on man thats a joke. Chicagos a top destination. Im not saying gang violence doesn’t exist or that its not bad but......</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a house in Mex, Also live in Long Beach CA, sometimes San Diego. I’ve been all over the boarder towns for years, 18 to age 25. Had a Mexican girlfriend and her Grandma lived in Escondido. Also been to Cabo and the surrounding area. 
As far as your previous comment, Chicago had over 500 murders in 2017. Chicago is a travel destination but if I dropped you off in some certain neighborhoods you wouldn’t last long. That’s goes for all the cities I listed. Yes Mexico has cartel and gang issues, worse than America but they are focused on opening drug channels by taking out other cartels in competing cartel towns. They are downright violent about it. This is what you hear about in the media, never anything good or about smaller fishing towns where Americans love to visit and buy homes living a low cost lifestyle. There are great parts to Mexico absolutely. </p>

<p>I mentioned Rosarito/Puerto Neuvo and La Paz and your reaction was that you wouldn’t visit those places. Those places are chalk full of Americans for that exact reason. I wasn’t really referring to the Mexican cities I meant the American ones you listed. Im aware of the gang violence in Chicago but</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thats pretty patronizing #1 and #2 I mean I’m sure I wouldn’t be raped, robbed, and murdered IMMEDIATELY amirite!? Of course there are places to be avoided thats a reality. Theres areas of LA i wouldn’t wanna wander into if I didn’t have to. I think your list is just a joke though. What are you even trying to say? Would you not visit those cities? Have you never been to any of them? You would avoid Cleveland at all costs but your A ok with Cabo? Its just not making sense to me sorry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I would visit those towns, in fact there is a bad ass area of Tijuana known for really nice restaurants. But I’m sure the once’s you listed are not the first pick of a tourist. I’ve been to a few of the cities I listed and of course there is great parts but there is also really bad spots. Those are actually the most dangerous cities in America by the way. And no, if I dropped you off in certain neighborhoods there you would not walk out. It’s extremely territorial and you would get fucked with for sure. 
Since you asked what am I trying to say...go back to the OP.  People don’t want to visit Mexico because of the way the media portrays it. Do you think some family that doesn’t know much of Mexico would go at all based on what they hear? It’s the people that look into it more or visit often that love it. 
What are you trying to say? That Mexico has problems lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was initially responding to your comment that its rather stupid to think theres some kind of media agenda to portray Mexico as anything other than what it is. Why would that be done? To what avail? Are we going to lose residents to Mexico? Is there going to be a white flight to small fishing towns in deep Mexico? Its dangerous to downplay Mexicos situation so I wanted to commented about my personal experience. People dont want to visit Mexico for valid reasons not because the media is shoving mis-truths down our throats. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.nydailynews.com/amp/news/world/brutal-killings-4-american-tourists-tijuana-sow-fear-california-article-1.412256">When I was in highscool four kids from my school were found tortured and murdered in a van after going to party in TJ. </a>. Every month in 2017 exceeded 2,000 homicide victims in Mexico. Oh and “A turf battle between the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels is believed to be driving much of the violence in the state, which is home to a popular tourist area in Los Cabos, at the southern tip of the Baja Peninsula.” </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/mexico-violence-monthly-homicide-record-2017-4"> -https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/mexico-violence-monthly-homicide-record-2017-4</a> </p>

<p>If anyone is spreading misinformation about Mexico its you. Don’t tell people its all fucking peachy because its really not. </p>

<p>P.s. The food scene in TJ is amazing thats the only thing you’ve said that I can get with. If your in the area again try out Telefonica! Such a cool spot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what your saying, but it’s like saying America is just gang wars, drugs, money trafficking, poverty and such. Those things happen both here and in Mexico. If I was in France and heard nothing but violence in America I wouldn’t go. It’s definitely a more dangerous place than America and the media should let people know what’s going on. But really that’s about all you hear in the media about the country. Both America and Mexico, in fact every country has great things about it. Maybe not the Middle East lol. 
But overall Trump and a ton of Americans have an issue with immigrants, drug cartels and people taking their jobs. Wouldn’t be a bad idea to just make Mexico look like a “shit hole” country. Especially if you want to build a wall. 
I’m definitely not spreading mis information, I said many times during our conversation it has some horrible things going on.  Not at all peachy...But it does have some beautiful areas, the people are wonderful and it’s a great place to visit in the right areas. 
I lived in Costa Rica, how many good things do you hear about it? Almost nothing but good things, jungles, wildlife, waterfalls, monkeys and nice people. These things are in Mexico as well. And I can assure you I saw so much fucked up shit there. Not as bad as Mexico when it comes to murder but I definitely tell people what to avoid there, which they would not know otherwise. </p>

<p>I saw a show on Telefonica, looks awesome and I hope to go. </p>

In fairness America is having some issues as you’ve pointed out so people should be aware. As people should be aware of the situation in Mexico. News outlets are kind of driven by negativity and not just here in the US. People have loved a good tragic story since Shakespeare nothing new.  Its not only Mexico that gets a bad rap. Acid attacks in the UK, kidnappings in south america, everything in Brazil holy crap. I wouldn’t read to much into it anyways not a fan of this theory personally.

    <div class="md"><p>Those books are definitely must reads. Also worth checking out &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; which deals with psychological trauma of populations and war crimes being presented as false righteousness by the authorities. It takes place during the bombing of Dresden but can be extrapolated to any collective punishment in war. This happened over and over again in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen, and other places. Millions were killed and the media puts a happy face over the deaths somehow pretending that it was all good or spreading democracy. Meanwhile people who witness the carnage lose their minds and go insane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit. Every country has travel advisories and/or a list of countries in which you will not receive diplomatic help. The language barrier and cost of moving is much more intimidating than some non-existant anti-travel propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh? Most countries are English speaking, and if not gladly welcome English language to become more international themselves. Cost of moving only due to system entangling Americans in debt and mortgages.</p>

<p>Anti travel propaganda most certainly is alive and well, and it’s funny how people on the inside don’t even realize it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m in Europe, and believe me, noone gives a shit about you wanting to speak English, because apart from Britain, not a single country has English as an official language. You’d be lucky to find someone wanting to speak English in rural France, Polish cops, and Italians ang Hungarians generally dgaf.</p>

<p>There are a few English speaking countries in Africa. Is that where you plan on moving to get away from all the propaganda and capitalism, you dolt?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend in USA wanted to visit me but couldn&#39;t go because her university umm adviser thing said my country (India) is the red zone and is extremely unsafe, and she showed me ridiculous amount of safety tips etc etc for travelling here. 
Basically, scared her enough that I had to tell her it&#39;s better not to visit a country if you are going to have such an extreme negative bias towards it.
I didn&#39;t feel offended, just sad that people so easily form a negative bias without even knowing anything about that place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny I actually live in East Africa. I also live in Euorpe as well part of the year and just speaking English I’ve been offered good pay in Switzerland and Germany to teach. </p>

<p>My point was that Americans don’t or shouldn’t fear living in countries because of a language barrier because it’s the one language most young people are keen on learning, at least that’s my experience, and mine being working in tourism with mostly European and Asian clientele. </p>
