        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am a long time reader first time poster on this sub reddit. Always loved the open mindedness of this sub and the opinions everyone has on different subjects so I&#39;m posting a question. Anyways people have been saying a lot about forgotten history and that we&#39;ve been lied to about who we are or what our true origins may be. This being said maybe humans were able to do extraordinary things and these abilities were able to be learned and utilized. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been looking a lot into sacred geometry, vibrations, stuff pertaining to the schools of the left and right eye of horus, meditation, and torus fields (or stuff pertain to the 5th unifying law of physics). Searching for these things I&#39;ve found a lot of hints of people being able to either manipulate objects and elements or even change them way back when. </p>

<p>Wether it be the Egyptians use of sacred geometry through there schools of horus to build great stuctures and talk to Gods, the use of meditation to attune to the elements and spirit, or the use of vibrations and torus fields to bend light, gravity, and even time there are a lot of things that show that humans can connect with the physical world and metaphysical world around us.</p>

<p>So could humans have had powers or extraordinary abilities, maybe we still do and I want to believe we do, what about you?</p>

<p>I think we are smart compared to where we came from, but we are stupid compared to where we are going. The human mind is likely more powerful than we know.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of &quot;we&quot; know exactly how powerful the human mind is, and everything from our media to our diets to our health treatments are all in the name of maintaining the status quo.</p>

<p>That being said, I believe that humans from ancient times lived more connected and in harmony with the natural world. This could have given them greater spiritual abilities; maybe even extra-sensory abilities.</p>

<p>Our modern world is so disconnected from nature. I think it plays a factor in inhibiting us from understanding ourselves as creatures and from reaching our full potential.</p>

<p>Humans will get tricked into wars, sides, lies they will prefer bots for sex, the whole landscape is going to change. In out lifetimes though, we are just going to see the birth and the crude versions, it&#39;s going to take them some time to get to that uncanny valley. This of course all according to him.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read some interesting things about psychics AND physics.  About how our present moment is a vibrational frequency that we exist in (like a radio station) and as Einstein says about all time existing at once, psychic&#39;s are able to tune to their perceptions to different frequencies and periods of time. Fascinating stuff</p>

<p>I only got 15 mins w him as a trial. However, I&#39;ve manifested some shit in my life just from thinking/feeling it would be so. In terms of genetics, he said his mother, grandma, great grandma all had the gene on. Science doesnt know this stuff yet in make fun of the occult mysticism</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cloning, EM field understanding, etc, the elites plan on using advanced technology to steal bodies as they age, if they aren&#39;t already capable of this.</p>

<p>Secondly, in terms of a human aspect/not technology based: Humans are capable of the greatest of evil, demons likely take note from our horrendous actions, and the corresponding emotions, as we are the ones who are acting out with this evil, but we are also capable of growth, we can prepare the land to be seeded, and we are capable of great logic that would confuse even the greatest of dimensional beings.</p>

<p>We are capable of walking a course of complete destruction, a path we know will destroy us, hurt us, etc, but we walk these paths to find the nostalgic love that we crave in our hearts, in hopes that we find it, and no one ever has to walk those treacherous paths again. Some of us are lucky enough to have someone with us during these journeys, others pray they find their companion along the way, but either way, we never lose hope, no matter how much you attempt to break a human, their is always a lingering hope.</p>

<p>We have lived under a monetary control system that is basically a mafia, just extremely powerful and fragmented, they have tried to poison us, they have literally attempted to cull us, but to no desirable effect, we are too resilient, no matter the conditions, the environment, we will in time, overcome what holds us down. The hope, the love that people create in this world through simple words, gestures, actions, etc truly bring greater change than we can imagine, if their is a spiritual, dimensional or nothingness side to the universe, these actions are still powerful enough to shape our entire being, not just one person, but all of humanity. </p>

<p>Everyone is discouraged right now, everyone is uncertain, and everyone wants the direct answer, but it seems that doesn&#39;t matter anymore, what matters is that you know that there are people here that love you, no matter who you are, its just some people like to produce the opposite of the love they receive, or some never receive the love they would love to be able to give, so they have no example, no understanding. </p>

<p>No matter what is and what isn&#39;t, What Is 100% True, is that you are here with me, reading this, and we both want great positive change to come sweep upon the earth, we want to see humanity become capable of sustaining with the Earth, as our Earth is currently changing, we are at the tail end of an ice-age and things are probably going to get fucked up in the next 100 years. We need each other, the more divisions, the more barriers we allow to be placed between us just makes us less prepared to handle the things WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO HANDLE TOGETHER when the time comes. </p>

<p>I am here for you, if you are here for me. I am the brains, you are the power, together there is nothing we cannot devour. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been studying a lot of different trains of thought as well, quantum physics, solfeggio frequencies/cymatics, ancient archaeology, etc.  I actually think we are moving forward in some areas (technology) but moving backwards in others (our ability to be in tune with the world around us).  Right now our planet feels like two people in a canoe, both rowing in the opposite direction and never moving either way.  There is so much hate, self-centeredness, and pettiness and it seems if we could just get past the superficial parts of life and work together, we could get that canoe going forward.  But the MSM and NWO (IMO) plant the seeds of hatred among the populace and they are very good at watering and fertilizing it...so it grows stronger every day.</p>

<p>I think more and more people are waking up, but it is a slow process and we are continually pushed back.  I think it will be a long time, if ever, before people reach that true level of consciousness where you will then have the ability to see the world as it really is and open up your mind to all it can do.  As physics likes to preach, we are all matter, but matter is just a concept and nothing is solid.  Life is a wave pattern.  Sound (frequency) can destroy anything solid.  Sound is everywhere in nature, in the sky, in our own bodies, even our own planet hums.  But the average, everyday person isn&#39;t listening.</p>

<p>I have this crazy theory that everything is cyclical and that humanity just keeps repeating itself.  I think we have all been here before.  We begin through evolution, grow into humans, build our cities, discover our technology, travel to space, live for thousands and thousands of centuries just moving forward into an advance civilization...and then we destroy ourselves due to our own basic greed and irreverance and the planet sits empty for a few millions years, healing, hiding all the secrets of the past, turning our cities back to stone and earth...and then we start again.   Maybe one of these times, we will get it right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Study savant syndrome. That is what we are capable of. I think our brains are artificially limited. If you have ever created a RPG character you know you can&#39;t max out every ability. Something is limiting human skill points, and basic social functioning takes too many points.</p>

What they can accomplish is just our imagination going wild, but what actual god attributes do you think they are succeeding in?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like for everyone to drop the walls, opinions and biases they have built over the years or were taught to have. I&#39;d like for the mass division of our beautiful race to end and us to see no matter what we really are eye to eye. Even if only so many people get that, well then it&#39;s a start. And if those people can teach the world to smile and we all feel for even a second what hope really is, then I believe people no matter how lost will find strength. I&#39;ll stand by you, but I&#39;m gonna make this world smile before I fight the powers that be. We need more of a human aspect again.</p>
