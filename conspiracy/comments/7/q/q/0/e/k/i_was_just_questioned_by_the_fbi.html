        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, I spent last week at CES here in Vegas in the position of my new gig as Director of Operations for a Government contractor. 
On the last day of the show, I take a stroll into the section that is dealing with the importers/exporters of electronics.  Unimpressive booths with mostly Chinese companies that want to ship a plethora of shitty electronics into the US.  </p>

<p>As I&#39;m standing in front of a non-impressive booth looking at the same shit from the previous 200 I looked at, I notice a not un-cute girl staring at my CES badge - which has my name, company name and an orange bar at the bottom that highlights the word &quot;GOVERNMENT&quot;.</p>

<p>She stares at my badge for a rather uncomfortable amount of time and is all fidgety as she makes an introduction and asks me what I do and why I&#39;m there.  Her name appears to be Russian/Ukrainian but her accent is &#39;off.&#39;  </p>

<p>Since I was bored, I flirt a bit, she seems to flirt back and we talk for about 5 minutes before I ask her if she is from Russia.<br/>
She says yes, but lived in Europe and now lives in Canada - which explains the fucked up Russian accent.  </p>

<p>I then told her that the only Russian I could say was &quot;Smiert Spionam&quot; - at which time, her face drains of blood and she looks at me with dead-eyes and says &#39;&#39;That&#39;s harsh&quot;, turns and walks away.  </p>

<p>This morning, my phone rings:</p>

<p>Me:  &quot;Hello&quot;</p>

<p>Guy:  &quot;Mr. [Redacted], this is Special Agent Briseno [Name changed so none of you dicks tries to fuck with me] with the Las Vegas FBI Field Office; I&#39;d like to ask you a few questions about an encounter you had during CES&quot;</p>

<p>Me:  &quot;Ok, which one of my asshole friends put you up to this?&quot;</p>

<p>Guy: &quot;Mr. [Redacted], I assure you that I am SA Briseno with the FBI.&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Tell you what, I&#39;m going to hangup now - then I&#39;ll call the local FBI det and ask for you by name - if they transfer me to you, then I&#39;ll take you seriously.&quot;</p>

<p>Guy:  &quot;Ok, here is the number...&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;No, I&#39;ll google it - thanks.  Bye&quot;</p>

<p>Me: *finds number, calls FBI detachment, asks for SA Briseno - get transferred - he answers with a &quot;Now, that that&#39;s out of the way - I have some questions for you regarding an encounter you had with a lady from Russia during CES.&quot;
He begins to question me on my conversation with this girl, what she asked, what I said, what she wanted, who she said she worked with, if she offered me anything to do anything and a million other questions.</p>

<p>Apparently, the phrase I said to her &quot;Smiert Spionam&quot; translates to &quot;Death to Spies&quot; and caused her to freak-the-fuck-out and make a call to --someone-- which was either overheard or intercepted and prompted a full-on investigation on her by the FBI. </p>

<p>I only learned that phrase from watching a James Bond movie where 004 was killed and that note was left by his body.  I thought it was funny...apparently she didn&#39;t and now she is under FBI investigation for who-knows-what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CES was wild this year.  I know I&#39;m looking at this from nothing other than a single dad perspective - however there was this awesome clothes folding robot.

<p>I love this part.  And then when he was going to give you the number, you hung up on him!  And googled it instead just to fuck with him and make him wait!</p>

<p>If you call a spy a spy, she will become confused and sacred and will <strong>retreat back into her spy lair.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we assume this actually happened, it&#39;s more likely that she &quot;freaked the fuck out&quot; because she thought you were threatening to kill her.</p>

<p>The FBI was asking you whether she offered you anything or asked you to do anything, because the FBI was wondering why the fuck you accused her of being a spy and then implied she should be murdered.</p>

<p>The FBI thought: surely this government employee didn&#39;t just accuse a random Russian woman of being a spy, with nothing whatsoever to prompt that. Surely she must have said or done something to make this man talk about killing spies.</p>

<p>So, the FBI talks to you for a little while, they figure out you&#39;re just a bit of a dope, and they drop the matter.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s all false. There are very few &quot;Director of Operations&quot; postions available, for a limited number &quot;Government Contractors&quot; that were in &quot;Vegas for CES&quot;, &quot;Newly appointed&quot; and involved in &quot;import/export&quot;. If you are who you say you are, good luck with the job search. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;plot hole&quot; of this post is why you didn&#39;t know what &quot;Smiert Spionam&quot; meant.  That seems like a pretty specific phrase, and was very conveniently used in the story.  It just doesn&#39;t seem realistic though that you would know that ONE Russian phrase without understanding the meaning.  It just doesn&#39;t make sense and I would even be disappointed if this was in a movie for that reason..</p>
