<p>Trump and Felix Sater</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/felix-sater-trump-russia-investigation">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/felix-sater-trump-russia-investigation</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whatever the truth of Donald Trump’s relationship with the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin, Sater is likely to end up being part of the story. He surfaced this week in leaked emails that he sent in 2015 to Trump’s lawyer, claiming he could engineer Putin’s support for a Trump Tower in Moscow and thus, somehow, a victory in the US presidential election.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,” Sater said, according to one of the emails, leaked to the New York Times. “I will get all of Putin’s team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.”</p>

<p>The Florida Mansion Story was in the news today. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/10/politics/russia-trump-real-estate-deal-wyden/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/10/politics/russia-trump-real-estate-deal-wyden/index.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sen. Ron Wyden, the committee&#39;s ranking member, on Friday requested the financial records of the sale of Trump&#39;s former estate in Palm Beach to Dmitry Rybolovlev.
Wyden&#39;s letter outlined how Donald Trump bought a 6.3-acre property in Florida for $41.35 million in 2004 and then sold that property to a company owned by the businessman four years later. The sale price to Rybolovlev more than doubled Trump&#39;s initial investment, to $95 million. The property&#39;s appraisal in 2008 fell short of that sale price by $30 million, Wyden said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump SOHO</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5273481/Trump-accused-money-laundering.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5273481/Trump-accused-money-laundering.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than one fifth of Donald Trump&#39;s US condominiums have been purchased by unidentified organizations in secret and in cash since the 1980s, an investigation has found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These transactions mean buyers can hide their finances and identities and avoid legal scrutiny, according to a report by BuzzFeed. </p>

<p>More than 1,300 Trump condos were bought by shell companies instead of people and the deals were completed without a mortgage, records of Trump&#39;s property deals show.</p>

<p>The Treasury Department says these characteristics could mean the buyer is laundering money.  </p>

<p>The amount of money possibly being laundered, which has been calculated by BuzzFeed, totals at around $1.5 billion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t care if his business dealings were shady...seems like most businessmen are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah the bad ones with multiple bankruptcies and that have to go overseas to getting funding cause American banks wont lend to him anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what it was. People have been brainwashed to believe (by the media and by useful idiots, and in the case of social media, shills) that if you don&#39;t believe in the Russia narrative, it means you just love Trump! I can think the Russian collusion narrative is a bunch of shit cooked up by the DNC and their cronies, while also not supporting the dude. </p>

<p>Where the hell did this childish belief come from that not believing every bad word the media pumps out about someone means you like them?</p>

<p>I can also not support that guy while thinking a drunk hamster would have been a better president than Corrupt Clinton. </p>

<p>Yeah, money laundering and the likes that every corrupt career politician, including Hillary, is guilty of. You won&#39;t be seeing the same neoliberal MSM outlets talking about this shit if she was elected. If they do, the narrative they spin will further the deep state policy of demonizing and antagonizing Russia and throwing us closer and closer to a war with them.</p>

<p>There is -still- no evidence that Russia had any meaningful impact in the elections.</p>

<p>You see the same talking heads in the MSM spewing this bullshit but refusing to talk about how the elections are rigged from the start by corporations, MIC, Intelligencia, and wealthy families. No mention of Israel&#39;s massive pull in the US government. No mention of the the DNC&#39;s literal collusion with the HRC campaign as well as conspiring to keep Bernie from being elected. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>stopping deregulation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true to a degree. However, regulations are largely a trap, because the regulating agencies get captured by the businesses they are supposed to oversee. These big businesses then use these regulations to fuck smaller businesses and stifle competition. Or &quot;regulations&quot; are instated that actually do nothing to prevent the behavior that necessitated their creation to create a facade of control. </p>

<p>An example is the New Deal. To start with, FDR was competely under the control of the Council on Foreign Relations. But he was portrayed as this anti-Banker, and the New Deal his magnum opus.
However, these regulations did nothing to actually fix the financial systems. </p>

The globalists that own the Democrats and establishment Republicans  needed some excuse to avoid saying that the will of the people were realized, so we get the Russian boogeyman fairy tale.

<p>It&#39;s sad that society has fallen to this point. When you say Try English that in and of itself is an attack. I was obviously using English and all you can muster is an attack on my grammatical error. And then you try to say it&#39;s not an attack? That&#39;s just an idiotic statement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew your response would be hilarious. </p>

<p>The first article is your standard CNN Trump hitpiece that attempts to exploit the fact that the averarage CNN viewer is ignorant of business. Bonds are standard debt instruments in finance and there is nothing nefarious about Trump&#39;s business using them for funding. </p>

<p>The Atlantic, also known for its extreme left wing bias, attempts to make it appear as if holders of Trump&#39;s corporate bonds have influence over him. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wells Fargo. JPMorgan Chase. Fidelity Investments. Prudential PLC. Vanguard Group. These are among the major financial institutions that own business debt held by Donald Trump</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bondholders exert no influence over the debtor, unless the debtor defaults  In this case, it would be Trump&#39;s corporations, not Trump that were affected by default. Trump is personally insulated from these liabilities, except for the debt that he personally guaranteed, which by the Atlantic&#39;s own admission is less than $100M. Again, the Atlantic is attempting to portray bonds as some sinister boogeyman to its naive readers. If this were the case, we&#39;d all be speaking Chinese because ey arecone of the largest holders of US bonds. </p>

<p>The FT is behind a paywall and the last link was bad. So, in summary, you failed to provide anything other than partisan propaganda to support your claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. </p>

<p>There was a homicide, the victim has been found by a local policemen. He calls it in</p>

<p>By the time forensics and the corner arrive on the scene, hours have passed. By this time, there is no body to be found, neither anything indicating that there was a body at any given point. Also by this time it&#39;s unclear which police officer was first at the scene and who called it in. </p>

<p>Days and weeks pass. They can&#39;t even find the slightest of evidence of a violent crime, let alone the murder itself. Not a single drop of blood. not even any disturbance on the concrete floor, a fine thick pristine looking layer of dust everywhere. </p>

<p>Would you still believe the by now unknown source?</p>

<p>Because tempering leaves a trail. Maybe unable to pinpoint the one behind it but, it&#39;s damn sure someone left a trail, a few drips of blood, some bodily fluids, disturbance of the ground.<br/>
Indicates the unknown by now police agent wasn&#39;t lying. He did indeed see a body, which is now gone...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  The entire Russia thing was first floated by Team Clinton back in May &#39;16, about the same time Seth Rich was downloading documents to leak.  Some of us were asking why the DNC didn&#39;t accept the FBI&#39;s offer to analyze the server.  The entire OMGRSHNZ!!! narrative is a smokescreen by the people who enabled Hillary.

<p>Republicans and Democrats both decided the sanctions should be imposed and made it so their decidion couldn&#39;t be vetoed. Trump signed off on it but, because he loves Russia so very much, neglected to actually sign it. </p>

<p>Do you think this is a normal amount of affection for Putin and Russia? </p>

<p>However, he is enforcing the sanctions, despite the common narrative to the contrary.</p>

<p>The sanctions in question are to be imposed on people and businesses conducting certain sorts of transactions with Russia. Since the sanctions bill has deterred people from conducting those transactions, there is no one to sanction.</p>

<p>If there is someone you believe has violated the bill and should therefore be sanctioned, please provide that information. </p>

<p>Otherwise we can see that Trump has both signed and enforced the sanctions law.</p>

<p>I have asked twice before that you please refrain from personal attacks. </p>

<p>From the article you have provided:</p>

<p>A State Department spokesperson said by email that the administration is &quot;using this legislation as Congress intended to press Russia to address our concerns related to its aggression in Ukraine, interference in other nations’ domestic affairs and abuses of human rights.&quot;</p>

<p>Potential targets of future penalties &quot;have been put on notice, both publicly and privately, including by the highest-level State Department and other U.S. government officials where appropriate, that significant transactions with listed Russian entities will result in sanctions,&quot; the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>In other words, the sanctions bill is being enforced, as per the linked article, and in exactly the way I previously described.</p>

<p>As I previously mentioned, if you believe there are entities that should be penalized and are not, feel free to share that with us here.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the conclusion based on the information provided is that Trump is enforcing the sanctions law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump had a message that resonated with many. I myself did not take him seriously for a good while and frankly thought it was a publicity stunt initially. As time went on and I did my own research I realized that wasn&#39;t the case and his agenda/message were what America needed. I will explain.</p>

<p>1) People can accuse/call the man &quot;racist&quot; all they wish but that simply isn&#39;t the case from what I found. Wanting to secure the country, wanting to hold people responsible for their crimes (anyone), calling it issues regardless of race speak to the heart of fact superseding every other issue. For the past several decades society had come to a place where being offended or being scared you may offend someone is of greater value than speaking to an issue, speaking truth and coming together to discuss issues. Our very country was founded on the discussion of issues and coming together to form the best conclusion and that was attacked the past few decades and replaced with ridiculous identity conversation which holds absolutely no value to better serving the bottom line. Should everyone be treated equally? You&#39;re damn right. Should there become an equality plus one value attached to someone based on identity? Hell no and that has been happening at the risk of offending others and that simply cannot happen. </p>

<p>2) I did not like the &quot;grab&quot; statement. However, I have been around sports and &quot;locker rooms&quot; my entire life and while I am positive few will admit they have taken part in such conversations I am positive nearly every man has whether they want to admit it or not. Granted what he said was over the norm but, still, he didn&#39;t do it, he merely said what &quot;does&quot; and &quot;could&quot; happen and therefore I couldn&#39;t hold it against him. If he had done it, a woman complained with evidence and he was convicted, then case closed but he merely stated how many women react to powerful men. Was he wrong? I don&#39;t think he was. Does that make it cool? No but it still doesn&#39;t make him wrong. Point being, I saw no reason to hold it against him. </p>

<p>3) Clinton and that ilk have effectively caused so many issues for so long now. I can write a novel on this and, if anyone wishes, will further explain but sufficed to say and to keep this precise and concise I will merely state they have caused global issues on such a massive level that her control would have been monumentally detrimental to the future of the country. It is obvious many shared my opinion on this given how the vote ended. </p>

<p>Did the Russians hack our election system and peak? Probably, they have been doing it for decades in one form or another but did they alter the election? Hell no. If there was even a chance that happened the hell that would have been raised would have been biblical in nature by the left. I do personally (my own opinion) believe that Putin/Russia saw Trump as a chance to come together with a potential ally in America where as they saw Clinton as a sure fire path to war given her blaming of them for shit and her accusation constantly being flung. They probably figured that would never end and it would eventually lead to conflict so, on their end, probably felt Trump would be better for both the US and Russia. The result? Well Russia has shared intel with the US on terrorist activity and the US has shared intel with Russia on the same. No reason, at all, that the two countries can&#39;t come together for a lasting alliance as the Cold War ended and if both countries were to come together many good things could occur. I see no problem with them preferring one over the other and I have no issue with Russia and that comes from a veteran who had, at one point, every reason to not trust them. At this point, I merely see them as a potential resource and ally that America should potentially consider. </p>

<p>Emotions being the driving force over logic and intellectual decision making are what gets people into trouble on a variety of issues. They see the short view and want a quick fix without recognizing the long term effects their emotions will bring. I recommend people put aside emotion, put aside the ridiculously corrupt/controlled media and do their own research. If they did they would find they have been told many lies. Trump is the best thing to happen for those illegally in country ever (yes I said EVER). Trump is the best thing to happen in terms of securing the borders/country and halting sex trafficking. Just look at what he has done since taking office - there have been 21 major busts already (&quot;major&quot; meaning over 50 in this case). Just look who has been exposed for REAL sex crimes/harassment of women (ie: Hollywood and the elites). He has taken the fight to the worst offenders that many had no idea even existed, how can anyone be upset about that?</p>

<p>I repeat, I initially thought it was a joke but he earned my vote as a once independent and I feel it&#39;s safe to say I am not alone on that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://endofinnocence.com/pizzagate-coverup-ben-swann-alive/">Ben Swann did a report a couple of months ago in which he explained how the Russians tried to influence the election.</a></p>

<p>It was a very specific incident and not an overall assessment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a fact that Twitter and Facebook found a large number of shill accounts which had been operated from Russia which were pumping out anti Clinton / pro Trump messages. How much effect that had, who knows. But they certainly tried.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Russia had some sort of effort working against both candidates, but focused more on Clinton, in order to somewhat discredit the winner and make it harder for them to lead domestically.  It&#39;s not a secret that Putin hates Clinton from her time as SecState, and like just about everyone else, I&#39;m sure he thought she was going to win, or at least the scales tipped in her favor.  </p>

<p>There was no way Republicans were going to lose Congress, so having a split Legislative and Exec branch affects a lot of foreign policy decisions.  I&#39;m sure if in 2013, if the Dems had the House in addition to the WH and Senate, America likely would have been a lot more involved in Syria.</p>

<p>So yeah I think Russia was definitely involved in Trump&#39;s favor in 2016.  The interests are there, and it&#39;s basically the only nation on the planet that could actually get away with it.</p>

<p>Do I think that&#39;s what swayed the election?  Maybe to <em>some</em> degree.  But, Hillary lost mostly because she ran on a platform of just continuing Obama&#39;s policies which we all saw some were good some were bad, but overall just totally average.  You need some new and exciting ideas to win, regardless of party.  </p>

<p>The biggest thing though, she has all of the corruption of her husband with <strong>absolutely none</strong> of the charisma.  The only people who can&#39;t see how blatantly corrupt The Clinton Foundation is has their fingers so far up their ears they can poke the back of their eyeballs.   Donald Trump was bringing Bill&#39;s (alleged I suppose) rape victims to debates, while Hillary was bringing people like Meg Whitman - former Ebay CEO and <em>Republican</em> candidate for Gov of California.  Which one of those screams &quot;real person&quot; to you?</p>

<p>That said, Donald Jr. has <strong>openly admitted</strong> to at least attempting to collude with upper class Russians.  Anyone who thinks there&#39;s <em>no chance</em> of that corruption also has their fingers in their ears. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most major countries have always tried to influence other countries elections... The US certainly has. The question is why it&#39;s such a big deal now!? Maybe the influence had a larger effect than expected due to the rise in social media?.</p>

<p>Hopefully we will get some answers over the next year or two, but I&#39;m not holding my breath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have always been amazed at what an unimaginative and lame story the Russia, Russia, Russia was from its beginning.  Obama admin sells Russia <em>uranium</em>, but then accuse.claim Russia was trying to sway election. Why?  They had the Dems where they wanted them already, selling out to highest bidder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did Russia want Trump to win? Maybe.</p>

<p>Did they influence the election in any meaningful way? No. </p>

<p>Propaganda by state actors is hardly a new thing. Also the US does it all the time. Remember the wikileak exposing US tampering in french elections? </p>

<p>Not part of the club?  He&#39;s cozy with and owes millions to the biggest global banks in the world.  If anything he would be at risk of being a pawn to TPTB considering his entire life is intertwined with these people.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t be this daft?  Massive debt tied to his and his entire family&#39;s livelihood and fortune to the very globalists he pretends to be against???</p>

<p>How does that work exactly.  He does anything to actually thwart them then they just ruin his life and Jrs life and Ivanka&#39;s life.</p>

<p>At least Hillary didn&#39;t owe money to the cabal.</p>
