    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re circling like vultures waiting for a comment like this. I&#39;m copypasta on purpose. This is just an experiment. </p>

<p>The FBI investigated one of their own agents for doing their job so that they could get to the Trump administration.</p>

<p>The FBI was working with Carter Page since 2013, sending him into Russia to do secret sting operations and entrap Russian suspected UN operatives - had Carter Page wired up for YEARS...... using him...</p>

<p>Along comes the Trump campaign and the corrupt FBI DOJ dems send Carter Page over to Trumps campaign - luckily for the corrupt Dems he secures a lame low end position, then goes on the FBI missions... and returns, for the FBI... at which point the FBI and DOJ write up their &quot;get dirty Don&quot; plan using Carter Page, their own operative, as the &quot;lynchpin&quot; ...</p>

<p>Carter Page REMAINS UNCHARGED TO THIS DAY BECAUSE HE IS AN FBI DOJ INTEL AGENT....</p>

<p>The FBI obtained the recordings after Sporyshev attempted to recruit an FBI undercover employee (“UCE-1”), who was posing as an analyst from a New York-based energy company. </p>

<p>UCE-1 might be Carter Page. From NYTimes</p>

<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-banker-sentenced-connection-conspiracy-work-russian-intelligence">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-banker-sentenced-connection-conspiracy-work-russian-intelligence</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/carter-page-trump-russia.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/carter-page-trump-russia.html</a></p>

<p>The court documents say that Mr. Page, who founded an investment company in New York called Global Energy Capital</p>

<p>I speculate that they didn&#39;t plan for everything to go this far. Their hubris kept them focused on only Hillary winning and still believe she did...</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s ditch this idea that Page was a controlled FBI informant/asset. That can&#39;t work because the TARGET of the FISA warrant was Carter Page. That is, the DOJ/FBI went before a FISA judge and swore under oath that they had credible verified evidence that Carter Page was working FOR a foreign intelligence service -- they alleged that he was a spy for the Russians, with the implication that Trump hired him because of this and Trump, through Carter Page, was colluding with the Russians to defeat Hillary. That&#39;s the Government&#39;s case.</p>

<p>Why did they think this? Well, according to Nunes&#39; memo, BUT FOR the Steele Dossier, the FISA court would NOT have granted the Carter Page FISA warrant.</p>

<p>So, the FBI was relying on the Steele Dossier for the key predicate fact that Page was a Russian Agent in the employ of Trump. Nunes&#39; memo, backed up by the sworn testimony of Comey, states that the FBI thought the Dossier was &quot;salacious and unverified.&quot; </p>

<p>ShareBlue responds, BUT FISA WARRANT WAS ONLY ISSUED ON DOSSIER! </p>

<p>Response: True, everyone admits that the FBI presented additional information to the FISA Judge, but ROSENSTEIN testified under oath that the FISA warrant would not have issue BUT FOR the inclusion of the Steele Dossier.</p>

<p>So whatever else the FBI presented to the FISA judge, it wasn&#39;t enough on its own to justify the FISA warrant. CASE FUCKING CLOSED. FBI rushed to get FISA warrant because they needed it RIGHT NOW to help Hillary Clinton win the election.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use American Citizen as an informant to bait foreign intelligence agents. </p></li>
<li><p>Use FISA to surveil this citizen and use their connections to foreign intelligence agents as the probable cause for them being a spy. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>That is, the DOJ/FBI went before a FISA judge and swore under oath that they had credible verified evidence that Carter Page was working FOR a foreign intelligence service -- they alleged that he was a spy for the Russians </p>

<p>They alleged he was a spy, when he was actually a controlled asset.</p>

<p>They perpetrated a fraud upon the court.</p>

<p>They perpetrated a fraud because the Title I warrant they sought and obtained is the broadest warrant available -- it allows you to look in depth into EVERY person Page had contact with.</p>

<p>This, I suspect is what Trump is bragging about here: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMiIgSpV5dY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMiIgSpV5dY</a></p>

<p>He and his team are &quot;the great sleuth&quot; because they managed to unravel this exceedingly devious FBI/DOJ strategy to surveil and take down Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my research, the Occult is the binding aspect of all of this...it is the reasons for the child abuse, for the dates chosen for these events. Understanding the Occult doesn&#39;t give the entire picture but it explains much of the reasoning behind the higher level Elites. I used to think just as you did, but over time my positions has changed. It isn&#39;t about &quot;satan&quot; or any particularly named god...it is about imposing their Will into Reality, which is what magick <em>is</em>. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not magick. Like I said, magick is the manifestation of ones Will into Reality. Music, a book, a poem, a symbol- all are magick. They invoke feelings and thoughts which may otherwise never have been, and alter the base nature of reality. That&#39;s what all Occult practice is really about.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, there are pedos, but what the Elite do is different. These children are subjected to ritual for a reason, to benefit from their fear and mental anguish. There are Occult reasoning&#39;s behind this.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not all things deemed &quot;Occult&quot; must have a spiritual basis...as I said, the definition of magick as the imposition of Will into Reality helps to clear this up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These kind of beliefs teach people to either be satisfied with their own ignorance or send them running down imaginary leads. Longest con ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Elite believe in the manipulation of the general social consciousness of their societies...this is done using what is considered Occult practices, in order to alter the subconscious perceptions of the target audience to gain the desired <em>willed</em> end of those practicing it. The Elites most definitely believe in this stuff,  not all but definitely those at the very top. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but your definition of magick is meaningless unless you further explain your concepts of &quot;Will&quot; and &quot;Reality.&quot; </p>

<p>Are you saying that the elites use, like, &quot;The Secret&quot; style of thinking? What you put out into the world is what you get? &#39;Cause that doesn&#39;t track and would never hold up under any sort of scrutiny.</p>

<p>If you mean to say no actual &quot;magical powers&quot; are used, and it&#39;s just Bad People implementing their Will on the world, then why say &quot;magick&quot; at all? I really don&#39;t understand how they &quot;impose their will&quot; on reality, and that&#39;s magic. I impose my will on reality when I get up in the morning and have bacon instead of sausage, is that magic?</p>

<p>All the stories about the elite occult business has to do with specific ritualised practices that originate in religions. Satanic sacrifice. Numerology. Blood magic. Etc.

<p>Will is any desired action. Reality is the actual world. The manifestation of ones Will into Reality is an act of magick- no matter how mundane. As I said, this can be accomplished through a book, or a song, or a symbol. It is an alteration of the base subconscious of an individual and of society, in order to achieve the desired effect.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying the Elite realize how to manipulate cultural thoughts and symbols to their own ends, in order to manifest their own Wills into Reality, which involves magick- an alteration of the base nature of the universe.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Magick is the manipulation of the base nature of reality, through a Willed action. Even mundane things can be considered magick. The less mundane- such as Music, creates thoughts and emotions in millions of minds that otherwise may never have been, causing them to take action that alters the base nature of Reality.</p>

<p>It is real to those who practice it. And it is real to those who see results from it. You do not have to believe it but what I am trying to show you is that the Elites <em>do</em>. This isn&#39;t just a red herring, this is the underlying motivation behind these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I must be honest that I disagree with your interpretation of events and this theory of magick. Your explanation of the magick, is, well, unmagickal. Magick by it&#39;s very nature is unexplainable, mysterious, and whose powers are known to a select few. Your idea of magick seems to be just ordinary cultural influence. Propaganda. Movies, books, poems. Yes, these have all been used to delude and control the populace. But there isn&#39;t anything magickal about it and no &quot;alteration of the base nature of the universe&quot; is required (I don&#39;t even know what that means, it&#39;s so vague as to be nearly meaningless). All of these effects are fairly well known and studied. People consume cultural content, they are influenced by it, and said influence changes their belief systems (or doesn&#39;t). The elite realize how to manipulate us because they also control our education system. They teach us to trust authority and listen to what they have to say. Even the most &quot;skeptical&quot; normie dude out there will still swallow the government&#39;s story every day of the week. No magick or secret knowledge required. Just bad education and good propaganda.</p>

<p>I do, however, appreciate that we are in effect on the same side of this. We both seek to see the ruling class brought down and for the entirety of mankind to be liberated, we just have different beliefs about how such things are undertaken in the first place, I think. But I feel this conversation will only precede in a circular manner where we each try to explain and justify the others&#39; world-view ad nauseam, so instead I will end this discussion here and wish you luck and good health.</p>

Even the most &quot;skeptical&quot; normie dude out there will still swallow the government&#39;s story every day of the week. No magick or secret knowledge required. Just bad education and good propaganda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is magick, which is what I&#39;m trying to say. Propaganda is a form of magick, which manipulates minds and changes the base nature of reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do, however, appreciate that we are in effect on the same side of this. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, we are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We both seek to see the ruling class brought down and for the entirety of mankind to be liberated, we just have different beliefs about how such things are undertaken in the first place, I think. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think we have different beliefs, I think we have different labels. You&#39;ve gotta open your eyes to the possibilities of what magick <em>can</em> be, not what you believe it <em>is</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I feel this conversation will only precede in a circular manner where we each try to explain and justify the others&#39; world-view ad nauseam, so instead I will end this discussion here and wish you luck and good health</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good luck, fellow traveller, I wish you the best. </p>

<p>There is a lot of woo woo stuff in occultism to hide the important stuff that they only tell you at the higher levels.

<p>If you looked into it, you&#39;d be really surprised at how many of them are in secret societies. It depends on who you ask, but at least 1/3 of the presidents have been Masons. Now, 1 in 3 regular Joes on the street isn&#39;t a Mason, so what does that tell you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The United States of America never truly won it&#39;s independence from the Crown (City of London). After the war, via the Treaty of Paris (and debts), the Crown along with Spain, France, and the Netherlands struck a deal to turn the colonies into the military arm of Rome - Holy Roman Empire, which is the parent Corporation. </p>

<p>To cut a long story short, the Tri-Sovereign States was birthed. 1871 was the &quot;meat in the stew&quot;, followed by 1913, which was the garnishing to our enslavement, by the oldest Corporation in the world via Capitis diminutio maxima.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sorry, but your definition of magick is meaningless unless you further explain your concepts of &quot;Will&quot; and &quot;Reality.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Will is any desired action. Reality is the actual world. The manifestation of ones Will into Reality is an act of magick- no matter how mundane. As I said, this can be accomplished through a book, or a song, or a symbol. It is an alteration of the base subconscious of an individual and of society, in order to achieve the desired effect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you saying that the elites use, like, &quot;The Secret&quot; style of thinking? What you put out into the world is what you get? &#39;Cause that doesn&#39;t track and would never hold up under any sort of scrutiny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m saying the Elite realize how to manipulate cultural thoughts and symbols to their own ends, in order to manifest their own Wills into Reality, which involves magick- an alteration of the base nature of the universe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really don&#39;t understand how they &quot;impose their will&quot; on reality, and that&#39;s magic. I impose my will on reality when I get up in the morning and have bacon instead of sausage, is that magic?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Magick is the manipulation of the base nature of reality, through a Willed action. Even mundane things can be considered magick. The less mundane- such as Music, creates thoughts and emotions in millions of minds that otherwise may never have been, causing them to take action that alters the base nature of Reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the stories about the elite occult business has to do with specific ritualised practices that originate in religions. Satanic sacrifice. Numerology. Blood magic. Etc. Again, all of that is nonsense and not real.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is real to those who practice it. And it is real to those who see results from it. You do not have to believe it but what I am trying to show you is that the Elites <em>do</em>. This isn&#39;t just a red herring, this is the underlying motivation behind these things.</p>
