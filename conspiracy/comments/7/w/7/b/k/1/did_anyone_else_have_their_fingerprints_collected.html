        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It just occurred to me that when I was in jiu-jitsu as a kid (about 7 or 8 years old), our instructor had the great idea to round all of us up and collect our fingerprints. He was also an RCMP officer, so of course I trusted him and figured that it was just a part of growing up, but now I can’t help but believe that he straight up abused his position of authority.</p>

<p>Now from what I’ve been able to gather the police cannot do this without parental consent, however, the fact that he targeted a group of people who already looked up to him doesn’t sit well with me. Furthermore, what would even compel the RCMP to gather our fingerprints other than the assumption that we may one day become persons of interest? </p>

<p>The idea is, if your kid goes missing they have their fingerprints? Which doesn&#39;t seem helpful at all when locating a missing kid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recollect my early public education like it was a dystopian novel.  In first grade I was the fastest runner in the entire school that went up to third grade and I was on average 9 month younger than the average kid.  I think that this says as much of my natural endowment as it does the sorry state of health of the kids going back even three decades ago.  I had too much energy so they drugged me with Ritalin.  They said it made me better.  I remember everyone being taught shit like &quot;Christopher Colombus sailed the ocean blue&quot; and seeing the robot children repeat it back like it meant something.  Even as a fucked up little kid I knew that something was deeply wrong and that I was surrounded by idiots and being taught idiot things.  It couldn&#39;t have been that they were all fucking idiots being taught idiot crap and were slow lethargic Pac&#39; N&#39; Meal eating low trajectory middling people but rather that I needed another dose of the drugs to see the awesomeness of that first grade wisdom.  Holy fuck what a waste of life.  Fortunately they didn&#39;t drug me for long and I figured out a few ways to skip out on it.  Thirty fucking years ago in the first grade I was hacking the system to get out of being forcibly assigned amphetamine drugs so that I could sit there like a potato.  As far as something like fingerprints.  You have to bet your fucking ass they served us up.  We were sold out and some more than others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had the same experience in elementary school. I learned real quick that intelligence was punished in school. Lesson #1 never say anything too smart or you will get in trouble. Shut up and play dumb, answer questions wrong on purpose. They took our finger prints on the first day of school from I remember. This is in the early 80s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fortunately I wasn&#39;t in that kind of more ghetto culture so I didn&#39;t have to pretend to be dumb.  I often just failed to find the meaning in most of the retarded lessons.  This then pushed me away from valuable skills like learning multiplication.  I knew that &quot;Colombus sailed the ocean blue&quot; was pointless so probably my times tables were as well.  It didn&#39;t trust them.  However, the bar on achievement is set so low that I could just pick it up the next year.  That is really just a lot of wasted time.  There is an early Star Trek TNG episode where a 11-12 year old kid is complaining about learning calculus.  That is easily achievable.  Instead we get fluoride toothpaste, Ritalin, gender confusion and baby sitting.</p>

<p>I wish their was a way to perfectly ascribe this accurate feeling to others (intuition maybe).  I was one of those kids who lived in the principle&#39;s office for various reasons, usually accused of being &quot;disruptive&quot; (questioned teachers).  </p>

<p>Shit like that triggered me cause I would become exasperated with shit curriculum, getting me to memorize the dates of when Napoleon lived &amp; died rather than expounding on the principles that guided him as a conquer &amp; leader or what it means to wield Power - nope, my man over was stranded on Elba, that&#39;s all you need to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mason here. I ran this program for our town locally a decade ago. In our state we collected DNA, fingerprints, a dental imprint, a few Polaroids, and coached the kids on what to do if they were abducted (things like spit everywhere for evidence). Not all Lodges in our state do this, but ones that do usually do it in conjunction with a town event like fire house open house, town fair, etc. I think the average is about 200 kids.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting that the identification kits were given directly to the parents for safe keeping, to be given to the police if something happened. No database or registry, at least in our state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s creepy as all get out.</p>

<p>I used to volunteer for a science outreach organization where we did fun science activities with kids. We did a forensics demonstration where the kids would stamp their fingerprints onto balloons and then blow them up and analyze the different structures, compare and see how they&#39;re all unique, etc. But it was emphasized that the kids either kept their balloons or we discarded them. If it involved collecting and storing kids&#39; fingerprints in some giant database, I&#39;d never have participated in that.</p>

<p>For what it was worth back then I don’t know how much foresight really went into it. It was about identifying children as the media created a certain paranoia about children being kidnapped at the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He probably did think he was doing the right thing. I can remember years ago, here in Cali, at different times the police departments would have drives to fingerprint kids and collect school pictures--but it was always with parental involvement and voluntary. This would be back in the late 60&#39;s through 70&#39;s. They would send the packets home to parents. But we were told it was in case of abduction--they would already have what they needed on file to hand out to other PD&#39;s when looking for an abducted child. And many times it was a parent during a divorce with custody issues in those days, so sometimes kids were found living with the parent in other states with alternate identities. That&#39;s where the fingerprints came in handy. Who knows what the higher ups wanted, but I think the rank and file law enforcement officers probably believed it was for the good of the child. They were parents, too. Back then, people were not so suspicious. But it also seemed like there were fewer pedo&#39;s. I&#39;m sure there were more back then than we ever realized. But I think there really are more today. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened to people. The morality has really plummeted. Maybe it&#39;s that there are more drugs and that creates more dysfunctional families--I don&#39;t know. There just seems to be more evil than there used to be. </p>

Asked questions like...  How many kids are in the house?  What hours are they left alone? How many entrences to your house are there? </p>

<p>The box promised to send you a &quot;kidnapping&quot; kit, you&#39;d get this envelope with finger print gear and a place to put photos, just in case, just so you&#39;re prepared.</p>

<p>The box had no company name on it, no phone number, no &quot;mail contents to&quot; X. It was there when I got there.  One day I called the police about a theft, and while they were there I asked them about that box.  They&#39;d never seen one like it, he decided to take it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i I think I remember mine having a place for a tiny drop of blood too or is this some crazy ass Mandela thing going on. It was before any real DNA technology so I remember thinking that it was ominous. Like there is only one reason they need your blood and it cant be good. But again I grew up in Florida so there were many crazy components to my childhood not just this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They took us to some department store like amusement park. I remember the fingerprints, and also this weird hole we had to stick our hands into. Felt like a bowl of spaghetti with a big hot dog inside it that got bigger whenever I touched it. At one point it started throbbing, and then some warm cream came out and when I pulled my hands back it was smeared all over the place. It was really gross, but I got a cool sticker. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>as a child, yes. There were places that would hold a day or two for children to be finger printed, they&#39;d receive a balloon and or a certificate on it saying how you got your prints done? That specificity I cannot recall. However flash forward to being in my late teens and hanging out with friends and being stopped by police to be checked for drugs, warrants, etc. Afterwards they asked if we could give consent to be DNA swabbed with a q-tip being rubbed in the inside of our mouths. The reason they gave was to be sure that none of us were serial killers or wanted suspects in a serious crime. I remember we consented just to show we had nothing to hide. Funny because I was literally thinking about this yesterday and how we had the right to say No, but because we&#39;d be refusing them, they&#39;d probably get angry and start doing their BS. We were already held for an hour on the side of the road and one of us had priors and with bud so they were cuffed and went down that night. 
But I can&#39;t help how having one&#39;s DNA on database could almost give too much away to be framed for whatever they&#39;d want. So many different outcomes that may be nefarious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, field trip to a police station and now I&#39;m sad. If it were &quot;fun&quot; they woild have let me keep a copy of my &quot;cool fingerprint&quot;</p>

<p>Curious to know those who have gotten it, how heavy the crime rate was. My school was in a heavily gang populated area in the 90s and the city consisted of mostly minorities. And gangs back then NEVER bothered children, so going missing was rare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many people recalling that it’s in case the kid goes missing... Do they dust for prints if a kid goes missing? Even if they did, wouldn’t they be dusting for prints at home? It’s not like they would know where to go. And say they dusted and found the kid’s print somewhere... how would that help, exactly?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elementaty school in the 80s fingerprinted my children and everyone elses children under the guise of identifying missing children when they were abducted and discovered dead.  This was done without parents being aware of it until our children came home with a card having their finger prints on it with a note to put it in  a safe place in case our children disappeared.  What? I thought.  This was nuts and, to me, a violation of individual rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember them telling us it was in case we went missing or were kidnapped but honestly have fingerprints ever been helpful in a missing persons case? Probably not. I remember one kid who was earned by his older brother before hand and it took 2 hours for the teachers to get him out of the hall ways. I wish I had balls like him cause his mom was eventually called and got him out of it. Probably know one else&#39;s parents new it happened until after. </p>
