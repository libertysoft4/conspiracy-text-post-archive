        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not a particularly dogmatic person so I sort of enjoy watching flat earth content from a distance or at least from an entertainment perspective but the last couple videos from the more popular channels like jeranism have been pretty pathetic to put it bluntly. Not that they are strangers to intellectual dishonesty or anything but this seems like they aren&#39;t even trying anymore. </p>

<p>The synopsis is just literally them watching the footage and saying stuff like &quot;I don&#39;t know how people think this is real&quot;, I mean there&#39;s not even an attempt to bring forth any kind of theory or reason why it&#39;s fake.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the difference between someone telling you they think the president is a werewolf because they&#39;ve seen them howl at the moon and someone just simply telling you that they think he&#39;s a werewolf, maybe on a hunch.</p>

<p>But still thousands and thousands of views and thumbs up so it&#39;s clear that a good chunk of the viewers are mouth breathers, as if there was any doubt </p>

<p>Nevertheless repeating the reveal after the official stream has ended is still a natural thing to do. </p>

<p>Musk&#39;s comment about its real cuz it looks so fake definitely doesn&#39;t help.</p>

<p>The crux of the issue lays with education. The math involved in this endeavour makes it invisible to many.</p>

<p>And the problem then is that it is beyond them. There is not a hope in hell that they will ever grasp it.</p>

<p>The live performance (as it may be called) showed the nose cone break off from the exterior trailing footage. Then they showed the car from inside when the nose cone deployed. </p>

<p>The fake space crowd has taken this as a sign that there was fuckery afoot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I&#39;m here to gain more knowledge than i had previously, and on occasion participate in discussion (I&#39;m a tad more talkative tonight than normally lol) but I&#39;m not here to fight bad theory. Byzantine, superstitious concepts are not exactly a negative outside of our &quot;fringe&quot; community. They&#39;re silly, and yes often distract from issues of weight. But they don&#39;t hurt you, they slow you down. So does your buddy&#39;s fish story you&#39;ve heard a thousand times. My guess is you don&#39;t fillet him alive, but rather force a smile, grin and bear it. That&#39;s flat earth, I&#39;ll ignore, but my time and energy will not be given to fight it, it&#39;s better spent elsewhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I politely disagree. The common folk see a stupid flat earth-video and associate it with conspiracy culture. When they then see a conspiracy-oriented source that actually does have a point to make, they&#39;ll dismiss it as &#39;more bullshit from the place flat earthism came from&#39;. It&#39;s all part of the psy-op to discredit us in the eyes of the public, and it&#39;s definitely a development we should resist with tooth and nail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So who defined &quot;conspiracy culture&quot; and why isn&#39;t Flat Earth allowed to be a part of it? It&#39;s arguing that a conspiracy is being committed. What other qualifications are there for a conspiracy to be considered legitimate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ones who control the media define what &#39;conspiracy culture&#39; entails to, aka TPTB. Even if the flath earth-movement is legitimate--whiich I don&#39;t think it is, but just presuppose with me--it is still dangerous, because it&#39;s giving TPTB such a potent control tool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That only makes sense if Flat Earth really was a psy op, but I don&#39;t think it is. First off, a majority of the Flat Earth posts can be attributed to people just wanting more information on the topic, but everyone here starts calling them names like shill or idiot. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to provide so much anti-FE material for the purposes of making conspiracy theorists look dumb. They already do that to themselves with countless theories. Intelligence agencies don&#39;t need to waste time submitting posts on our behalf in order to keep the FE debate going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said it was originally started by TPTB so are you implying that they went back and time and convinced all ancient historical cultures that the world was flat? If anything has been originally started by TPTB, it is all these &quot;scientific&quot; theories like 1) the earth is a globe, 2) gravity keeps everything on it, and 3) it all started with a big bang. Study the people who proposed these theories and then the people who had the most influence in their propagation among scientific concepts.</p>
