        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You can&#39;t wield a certain level of material power while you have empathy. So there are ways to shed it, and it&#39;s conducive to sort of bleed it out of populations to facilitate the grand hustles. Empathy is key to who we really are, who we forgot we were. A lack of empathy is essential for acceleration into the upper echelons which indeed seem to be under the jurisdiction of forces with no empathy at all.</p>

<p>Thus all the horror and corruption that seems impossible or worthy of ridicule to people who can&#39;t feel it&#39;s reality goes on and is shrugged off even even noticed. Meanwhile the same baffles and crushes those of us who have resisted anesthesia. It gets worse and worse even as it is unveiled because the people perpetrating it have become harmonized to the dull hum of their own control machinery and don&#39;t know how to switch it off. </p>

<p>They are slaves of another kind. We imagine them as masters but maybe they&#39;re really much closer to fevered, spent addicts who must go into darker areas and do more unspeakable things just to keep the damned thing in motion. Because they have traded in humanity for power, they have only power. So if the connection for power demands Hell on Earth, Hell they will construct and maintain.  But the thing is, empathy is the glue of what is eternal beneath the material veneer of life and nothing holds without it. No empire, no dynasty, no secret beitherhood or cult lasts forever, however ancient or entrenched. </p>

<p>Resist, subvert, dismantle, but do not become a demon to fight the Devil. Hang on, and keep your heart about you. The game is getting good.  </p>

<p>When the October fires of Norcal came I&#39;m pretty fucking sure that they used both water and fire to stop everything from burning down.  They set off controlled fires to preempt the larger fires.  My point is that if things get to a certain point then you have to be willing to kill people who are destroying your life.  That isn&#39;t to be taken lightly in the same way that just setting off fires everywhere shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly.  However, if they had done so the big one wouldn&#39;t have fucked us so hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, one of my favorite quotes of Nietzsche&#39;s. We must have slightly different translations, as mine reads &quot;monsters&quot; rather than &quot;dragons,&quot; but same difference really. I&#39;m not as obsessed with Nietzsche as I was as a younger man, but he&#39;s still one of my favorite thinkers. Very misunderstood by a lot of people I feel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that you misunderstand empathy.  Empathy is the ability to understand another persons mental and emotional state.  That doesn&#39;t inherently mean that a person will give a shit about anything, but only that they can perceive something.  It is implicit that a normal functioning human will want to avoid the needless suffering of others but if they are somehow different than normal then this might not be the case.  The big bad here is of course sociopathy.  I think that you are correct that its an obvious bad dark place that is just an endless churn of thrashing paranoia but it doensn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t anticipate your state of mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember, it is not difficult nor should it be admired when a person sheds their empathy. It is not a skill, it is simply a loss of something. Anyone can take a cake and turn it into a giant mess. That&#39;s what turning off your empathy does. But you can&#39;t take the cake mess and turn it back into a cake once it&#39;s destroyed. </p>
