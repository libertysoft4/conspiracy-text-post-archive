        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-02-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/RailroadedorNot.html">RailroadedorNot</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From 1997 to 2002 in the Manchester, New Hampshire-area (almost 5 years), I did everything I could think of in a highly-visible manner to disseminate the theories of nationally-known income tax protester Irwin Schiff. That included being interviewed many times in many different types of media and guest hosting a popular Southern New Hampshire talk radio show numerous times. During all that time, the Feds never gave me any trouble or tried to silence me. Then 9/11 occurred.</p>

<p>Immediately after 9/11 occurred, I began widely disseminating repeatedly to hundreds of elected officials, news media, pundits, law enforcement officials, reporters, etc. my belief that Zionists in the U.S. Government and Israeli Government (Mossad) had orchestrated it and blamed it on their enemies in the Middle East, Arabs and Muslims. I alleged that they did so in conjunction with their allies in the major news and opinion media. I alleged that the purpose was to dupe the United States into greatly expanding its military presence there and to wage war on some of Israel’s enemies.</p>

<p>In December of 2001 (3 months after 9/11 occurred), I was also widely disseminating the recently-deleted, 4-part Fox News exposé into Israeli spying on the United States and Israeli use of that espionage to derail law enforcement actions against Israeli Organized Crime. Fox News Channel deleted all four (4) news segments and their transcripts from its website almost immediately after the fourth segment aired.  At that time, I was also widely disseminating other information detrimental to Zionists and/or Israelis.</p>

<p>Ten (10) days later, approximately twenty (20) armed Government law enforcement agents raided my home/office in Auburn, New Hampshire and informed me that I was the target of a federal criminal investigation into violations of the internal revenue laws! I was subsequently indicted on specious income tax violations, prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to nine (9) years in federal prison! I was released from prison in 2009.</p>

<p>I have published a website detailing that whole fiasco, including the transcripts of the deleted 4-part Fox News exposé. It is located at RailroadedorNot.com. For anyone interested, I have also written a book entitled “Railroaded or Not”, which is available on Amazon. My Twitter handle is @RailroadedorNot. </p>

<p>Worse...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On February 12, 2004, after a six day jury trial, [redacted] was convicted of fifteen counts of preparing false tax returns and amended returns for others, two counts of preparing false amended tax returns for himself and one count of corruptly impeding the administration of the federal tax laws. During the period in which the crimes were committed, [redacted] resided in Auburn, New Hampshire.</p>

<p>[Redacted] was sentenced by U.S. District Chief Judge Paul J. Barbadoro, who presided over [redacted] trial. Judge Barbadoro increased [redacted] sentence on the grounds that [redacted] obstructed justice by testifying falsely at trial. Judge Barbadoro also increased [redacted] sentence, because the evidence at trial showed that [redacted] filed frivolous lawsuits against, threatened and sought the baseless criminal prosecution of IRS employees and other government officials who lawfully tried to assess and collect taxes from him.</p>

<p>I wont link the document, and I have redacted the name to prevent any accusations of doxxing, but OP provided a link to his website where his name is stated. From that you can find the above press release issued at the time of his conviction.</p>

<p>This guy didn&#39;t just refuse to file his own tax returns, he advised and assisted others to evade taxes by filing false returns. He also committed perjury and harassed government officials.</p>

<p>He&#39;s telling a bullshit story about 9/11 now, but his case had nothing at all to do with 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Irwin Schiff always contended that for all of the different types of federal taxes, there is a statute imposing the tax and another statute making someone “liable” to pay the tax. Except for the income tax, that is. There is a statute imposing the income tax, but not one specifically using the word “liable” with respect to it. He contended that that meant that the income tax is not mandatory.</p>

<p>But there is a statute that uses verbiage equivalent to using the word “liable.” Schiff mistakenly believed that use of the word “liable” was mandatory. He failed to realize that that is not true and that judges have more discretion than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From another thread  by OP, where he posted essenstially this same thing 9 months ago:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I went to trial without legal representation because I believed that a lawyer would not defend me properly i.e., raise the issues I wanted raised, file pre-trial motions regarding those issues, document mistakes made by the Government and the judge to be raised on appeal, etc. In other words, I believed that a lawyer would assist the Government and the judge in &quot;railroading&quot; me into a conviction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have no solid evidence that I was targeted to prevent me from continuing to widely disseminate my beliefs. How do I obtain such evidence and what is my recourse after obtaining it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, this is what he did to get himself in trouble:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17 counts of preparing and filing tax returns which I knew and believed to be false for myself and others. But I didn&#39;t believe that they were false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were a tax return devised by Irwin Schiff to inform the IRS that it was the filer&#39;s belief that there was no law making the income tax mandatory and, therefore, no tax liability. I had been doing everything that I could think (in a highly visible manner) to promote Schiff&#39;s conclusions about his income tax research for 5 years with no problem from the IRS or the Justice Department. Until I started widely disseminating by belief about 9/11, that is.</p>

<p>I also had one count of interfering with the Gov&#39;t&#39;s collection, of which I was also not guilty but convicted anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have since come to believe that Irwin Schiff was incorrect about his income tax thoeries. But at the time that I was involved in it, I believed it whole-heartedly. That&#39;s why I believe that I was not guilty of committing the crimes for which I was convicted</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember this. Do you think it&#39;s possible that he got nabbed before Schiff because he was repeatedly contacting &quot; hundreds of elected officials, news media, pundits, law enforcement officials, reporters&quot;?</p>

<p>I mean, if you are breaking the law it&#39;s probably best to not force yourself on the radar of lawmakers and law enforcement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No surprise here... but he&#39;s a bullshit artist. His site gives his name and from that you can determine that he was <a href="http://www.quatloos.com/Tax_Protestor_Swan_arrested.htm">arrested in March 2003</a>, not December 2001/January 2002. He was <a href="http://www.nhd.uscourts.gov/jury-verdicts-4">convicted in February 2004</a>.</p>

<p>So, not only was he not arrested &quot;Ten (10) days later&quot;, but he was also arrested and convicted <em>long</em> after Schiff, who was first convicted in 1979, and then again in 1985.</p>
