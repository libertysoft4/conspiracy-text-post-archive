    <div class="md"><p>I like to think we are on the cusp of a new society.  Where government is recognized for what it is. Just a group of liars selling our Liberty for money and more power, responsible for every bad thing happening around the world.  This includes every faucet of my government, as well.  Especially mine actually.  More and more people are waking up to this. We need more people to recognize how incompetent and corrupt it is. It&#39;s time to she&#39;d these massive, grossly expensive top-down foreign entities and settle on a localized government that can&#39;t hide from its constituents in it&#39;s own foreign city.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe this is a local maxima in humanity&#39;s evolution on Earth. The younger-dryas research undeniably displays evidence that humanity&#39;s peak civilization prior to 12,000 years ago was completely erased from the surface of the planet. Plato pegged Atlantis&#39; fall around this time period and I think it&#39;s for a reason. One of the tricks being played on the consciousness of society today is that we are the greatest to have ever existed and we are the peak of humanity.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s a sham.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sincerely worried that we&#39;re rapidly approaching a grand finale. Hardly anyone seems to care about the risk of nuclear war anymore. We invented world-ending weapons, were terrified for awhile someone would use them, made it through the Cold War alive by the skin of our teeth -- with more close calls than most people realize -- and have since developed an false sense of invulnerability.</p>

<p>Now that the (entirely rational and appropriate) fear has faded, we&#39;re in an unprecedentedly dangerous situation where an unpredictable, narcissistic POTUS is being constantly goaded to show how tough on Russia he really is, where any move whatsoever toward detente with Russia is portrayed as proof he&#39;s Putin&#39;s puppet. Absolutely terrifying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A tipping point.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not there yet, but sometime within the relatively near future, as in 100 years or so, humanity as a whole is going to reach a point of no return where it has to decide where it needs to go to survive. This is a very vague description, but everything that has happened within the last 100+ years or so is leading up to this. The depletion of natural resources, the ever increasing wealth inequality, insurmountable debts, never-ending wars, a &quot;connected&quot; world that just becomes more and more divided as time goes on, loss of jobs to automation, refugee crises, etc. No matter where you stand on whatever issues, you have to realize that the direction we are heading is not sustainable long-term.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if this will happen in any of our lifetimes, but I think its bound to happen at some point. And it&#39;s going to be up to us to determine if we are going to persist or perish like civilizations before us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we are at a really critical moment. After WWII, TPTB have greatly consolidated their power. There is some infighting, but I think they have had a great level of control for some time now. They have been able to carefully tailor propaganda to the masses, with the masses being mostly compliant and unaware.</p>

<p>However, this all changed with the advent of the internet. I don&#39;t think they anticipated how the internet would allow for the free flow of ideas, and it makes it significantly harder for TPTB to keep their propaganda and lies from being threatened by the truth. They&#39;ve tried and, thus far, failed to control the internet. They&#39;ve resorted to disgusting things like shills, which we see plenty in this very sub.</p>

<p>Now, people are finally starting to wake up, and Popularism and Nationalism are spreading around the world like wildfire. Most people now see how the Globalists are fighting against the will of the people. The more people that can wake up from their propaganda-induced dream, the better chance we have of winning this war.</p>

Historically we are in the transition period period ages in the cycle, likely an iteration that resembles previous ones, an exciting time nonetheless. Currently, there is a macro shift happening in the way people connect and nations connect and the world is forming the beginnings to a global community through the internet among other technologies like cryptocurrency and social media platforms etc. The next 5-10 years will see rapid changes and likely a market or economic shift that will further alter the landscape and facilitate another transition on a material level of which I am unsure how it will play out. </p>
