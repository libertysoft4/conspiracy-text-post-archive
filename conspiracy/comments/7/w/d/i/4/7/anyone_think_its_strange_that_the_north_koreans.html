<p>Last Summer Olympics someone was kicked out for not shaking an opponents hand after a match. He did it for political reasons. I think it was an athlete from Egypt that didn&#39;t shake a Palistinian&#39;s hand. Could be remembering the countries wrong though.</p>

<p>Politics have no place in the Olympics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a post a couple days ago which kind of made sense.
There is speculation North Korea is a CIA controlled state...I don&#39;t know if if go that far but everything fits.
Kim Jung Un went to a cia school growing up and when you see pictures of them in different facilities it looks like their technology is from the 70s..furniture, screens computers.
And supposedly they have nuclear capabilities?....I don&#39;t think so...
I wouldn&#39;t put it past Israel and the US to pull something like that off.</p>
