    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s all political. The media is owned by the two political parties. Republicans been slacking... They only own Fox news, OANN, WSJ, National Review, Washington Examiner, Breitbart &amp; NYPost.... Democrats own everything else. It&#39;s a 80:20 ratio in favor of the left. Therefore their voice is louder and why every story about Trump is considered true because they all work in unison with each other to put that message out.</p>

<p>Lawrence Lessig, the Roy L. Furman professor of law and leadership at Harvard Law School, outlined a scenario in which the former senator could take the reins of power in the event of a series of impeachments of the Trump administration.</p>

<p>If President Trump resigns or gets impeached, Vice President Mike Pence resigns or is impeached and House Speaker Paul Ryan – who would legally become the heir to the top job – appoints Clinton as his deputy and then resigns, Clinton would become the president, the professor said.</p>

<p>This totally seems like the likely scenario. Thank for opening my eyes to the genius deep state plot to put Hillary Clinton in power, so much cleaner than just having her win the election to instead have the most elaborate convoluted power grab in the whole history of the country.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m glad you just completely stopped trying to argue there was no Trump-Russia evidence and moved the conversation to this brilliant plot. Thank you for uncovering it! Now I&#39;ll just await all of these steps, but my particular favorite when Paul Ryan makes Clinton his &quot;deputy&quot; and then the constitutional chain of succession seeks to exist for reasons.</p>

<p>WOO HOO! </p>

<p>GOD DAM RUSSIANS BOUGHT ADS ON FACEBOOK, hacked the American election,. and used that to convinced  Americans to vote for the most disliked, unqualified, divisive, spoiled rich celebrity  show host to ever run for President. <a href="http://www.wwe.com/videos/donald-trump-enters-the-hall-2013-wwe-hall-of-fame-induction-ceremony">Not to mention the only candidate ever to be in the WWE hall of fame.</a></p>

<p>GOD DAM THOSE RUSSIANS ARE SMART!!!!! </p>

<p>Hillary had tens of thousands of people working for her, sub Reddits taken over by CTR , Mod positions infiltrated by CTR, Coerced with MSM as to what was and was not acceptable- even fed them stories and corrected theirs, had debate questions given to her before the debates, people like Seth Rich who possibly could have ealked DNC emails, Staged appearances with questions and all on shows like Ellen, A president that campaigned for 6+ months day in and day out, spent 1.2 billion, hired biased Trump hatting foreign intelligence to dig something up on Trump to rthe tune 1+ M,......................yet those dam 16 Russians with their assumed few thousand dollar budget managed to thwart all of that and............convinced America, as a unit, to elect the WWE superstar.</p>

<p>You see how this looks, Skippy Hillbot? </p>

<p>This person was elected 2 times for senate in a overwhelmingly Democratic state, without a challenge worth mentioning, yet she hgas been embroiled in a political scandal for 40+ years, </p>

<p>She lost because she sucks. Go read the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5dbxk1/serious_people_who_have_met_or_dealt_with_hillary/">responses from the people of Reddit.</a></p>

<p>One thing confuses me though......these Russians, doing all I said above, they are pretty fucking smart......so what the fuck did they need to collude with them for to hack into the DNC? Is Trump some sort of hacker mastermind we don&#39;t know about, and the Russians needed to consult with him for insight?</p>

<p>Can you tel me exactly how Russia swayed the public away from Hillary and toward Trump? Some twitter accounts, facebook ads don&#39;t do it. That is equivalent of saying &quot;they took out ads on every social platform available. </p>

<p>It&#39;s rhetoric, easily dismissed, just like you will dismiss my comments. </p>

<p>They were very successful. This isn&#39;t hard. I don&#39;t know why people are so adamant it never happened, facts be damned. I haven&#39;t seen this level of denial since Russian backed rebels downed that airliner over Ukraine. </p>

<p>It&#39;s Russia. There&#39;s an <em>abundance</em> of corroboration. They are a foreign adversary. Our relations with them were not good and our sanctions were yielding very damaging results on their economy. </p>

<p>I honestly think the only reason people deny it happened is because it somehow reflects badly on Trump&#39;s win. And they have to defend Trump no matter what. Isreal does this. The US does this. Russia has done this in the past (funny how it was never disputed then, huh? Kinda lends credence to my theory about why it&#39;s being denied now). They did it in France. They did it in Germany. Theyve done it all over Eastern Europe. In fact, Eastern European former soviet states were instrumental in identifying Russian hallmarks on our own election.</p>

<p><em>Because they do this so fucking much to them those people have gotten good at detecting it</em>.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t hard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s great that you are so convinced Russian&#39;s &quot;hacked&quot; the US presidential elections and got Trump elected, but can you tell me specifically what Russia did to sway the votes in Trumps favor? </p>

<p>What I know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bought ads on Facebook</li>
<li>Allegedly hacked DNC emails and exposed the DNC for tilting the scales and plotting against Bernie Sanders</li>
<li>Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer allegedly to try and get inside information on the opposition</li>
</ul>

<p>Please tell me outside of what I laid out how Russia &quot;stole&quot;, and/or &quot;hacked&quot; the elction so Trump could win. </p>

<p>Because ads on facebook stealing the election is silly, exposing the DNC I blame the DNC for, the meeting with Trump jr. and the lawyer was set up by DNC, Clinton, and Obama. </p>

<p>I thought Trump won because the DNC put up a horrible candidate that bought and bribed her way to the nomination. </p>

<p>By the way, those of us that are genuine <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subscribers know who hacked the DNC, his name was Seth Rich. </p>

<p>You cannot provide what does not exist. I want to see an ad, something Russia put to damage Hillary. I don&#39;t want to see an article from MSM known to lie. MSM colluded with the Clinton campaign, so why in the hell do I trust to report truthfully about this? </p>

<p>That has many ads put out by Russia on Facebook. Here are some more:</p>

<p>I guess these arent real either? </p>

<p>This shows that Russia also organized protests in the US to cause more disruption and division.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, because if you are colluding with Russians, rather than actually collude and shit and talk sanctions, it makes much more sense to get a Russian lawyer to email a publicist to try and contact Trump Jr. with a lie about having dirt on Clinton in order to secure a meeting where you can then surprise everyone by talking about sanctions.</p>

<p>Yes it does actually and you just because you use the jumbled sentence strategy to say it weirdly doesn&#39;t change the fact that they met to discuss exchanging a reduction in sanctions for assistance in winning the election.

<p>What I know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bought ads on Facebook</li>
<li>Allegedly hacked DNC emails and exposed the DNC for tilting the scales and plotting against Bernie Sanders</li>
<li>Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer allegedly to try and get inside information on the opposition</li>
</ul>

<p>Please tell me outside of what I laid out how Russia &quot;stole&quot;, and/or &quot;hacked&quot; the elction so Trump could win.</p>

<p>Because ads on facebook stealing the election is silly, exposing the DNC I blame the DNC for, the meeting with Trump jr. and the lawyer was set up by DNC, Clinton, and Obama.</p>

<p>I thought Trump won because the DNC put up a horrible candidate that bought and bribed her way to the nomination.</p>

<p>By the way, those of us that are genuine <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subscribers know who hacked the DNC, his name was Seth Rich.</p>

<p>One last question</p>

<p><strong>Why would Russia want Trump, when they were getting everything they wanted from Hillary?&quot; Uranium one?</strong></p>

<p>What Russian intelligence agents? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not every theory, while blackmail is totally a possibility I think the piss tape is largely considered unlikely to be true. It also hurts Trump that he behaves and speaks (and tweets) in a way that supports many theories about him. For instance,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The recent porn star scandal, supported by taped conversations of Trump talking about cheating on his wife, plus very suspicious payments to the woman in question.</p></li>
<li><p>Russia, supported by his sharing of secret intel with Russians, refusing to enforce sanctions on Russia signed into law <em>by him</em> and passed with an overwhelming majority, and his firing of Comey to attempt to end the Russia investigation (I could go on here)</p></li>
<li><p>All the drama from within the WH, supported by high turnover, the consistent reports, and most of all Trump tweeting insults and passive-aggressive snark about anyone who he ever perceives to have crossed him.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, people believe the bad stories about Trump because Trump built a framework that makes them plausible. Was there one specific story that stood out to you that I missed where you feel he was treated unfairly?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Trump is a self interested half-wit blowhard.  So are news organizations, but telling his base that the news is all liars helps to deafen them to any attempts to point out his bs. </p>

<p>So while some news is crap some is true, but painting them all with the same brush helps to minimize the impact of unfavorable stories. </p>

<p>Look at the way the right ate up any and all stories against Obama regardless of facts (there were plenty). Now that the ball has flipped the news are obviously corrupt liers out to dethrone god emperor Trump.  (People are more likely to believe a lie that they want to  be true)</p>

<p>It is simply in Trumps best interest to look like he is under attack by a bunch of liers out to get him.  If you look at his past it is always the same story he uses to defend himself. </p>

<p>The bottom line is the news lies and exaggerates, but where there is smoke there is usually fire and not everything can be a lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a pretty glaring fact you&#39;re pointing at there too because here&#39;s a NY billionaire (which on this sub, that in and of itself usually makes people suspicious) who, <strong>by his own admission</strong>, exploited and preyed on poor people&#39;s misfortunes. Who called their plight &quot;a great opportunity for him&quot;. Who is the epitome of a vulture capitalist. Here&#39;s a guy who is wrapped up in all sorts of fucking shady dealings and relationships, from russian mobsters/oligarchs, to hollywood elites, to convicted high-dollar pedophile Jeff Epstein. Who parties with the Clintons. Who is apparently at the beck and call of Israel (it has has been one of the most focused and consistent issue of his entire term from the first day)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a guy who has never made it a habit to help out ordinary people. A draft dodger. A serial liar (from crowd sizes to &quot;lock her up&quot;, from border walls to media ratings, from the unemployment rate to things he&#39;s on camera/tape saying), deceiver and media manipulator (&quot;I can shoot somebody on 5th avenue and my ratings would go up). Who has a massive cult of personality both online and IRL replete with jabbering idol-worshippers who twist, contort, lie and roll-over at the snap of his finger. Who surrounds himself with shady characters. Who is mired in an ever-expanding FBI investigation (WTF! FBI investigations are fake news now!)</p>

<p>And that&#39;s not to say Obama or Clinton or Kennedy or <em>anyone</em> else was better ... But that <em>this</em> is the guy so many people worship, constantly make excuses for and play damage control for on here is nothing short of baffling and completely mind-blowing. </p>

<p>If there was <em>ever</em> an administration that should be the intense interest of conspiracy-minded communities, it would be this one. From criminal links to financial crimes, from case-studies in mind-control to conversation about how bots are manipulating public opinion and distorting conversations and dissent... From the ordinary outrage over lying politicians to pedophiles in the highest levels of government. You want a case study of an administration obstructing and subverting justice and government institutions? This administration has it. You want an example of blatant media manipulation and coordination? This administration has it! </p>

<p>THIS president and his administration should be the fucking focal point of any genuine conspiracy discussion group. It has it fucking all. </p>

<p>This may be the first president I have ever seen where criticizing him, presenting theories against him or just dissenting from the pro-government narrative will label you a &quot;shill&quot; or &quot;deep state&quot; in conspiracy spaces. In contrast, you had Obama, for example, and Obama had a <em>deep</em> fucking fanclub of fawners and idolizers in the mainstream. But in conspiracy places, you had fans as well but when people criticized him... It wouldn&#39;t identify or label you a &quot;shill&quot;. </p>

<p>This cult behind trump is troubling as fuck. Idk why nobody else sees it but the pull this guy has is fucking <em>deep</em>. Idk. It&#39;s so fucking strange</p>

    <div class="md"><p>can you tell me specifically what Russia did to sway the votes in Trumps favor?</p>

<p>What I know:</p>

<p>Bought ads on Facebook
Allegedly hacked DNC emails and exposed the DNC for tilting the scales and plotting against Bernie Sanders
Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer allegedly to try and get inside information on the opposition
Please tell me outside of what I laid out how Russia &quot;stole&quot;, and/or &quot;hacked&quot; the elction so Trump could win.</p>

<p>Because ads on facebook stealing the election is silly, exposing the DNC I blame the DNC for, the meeting with Trump jr. and the lawyer was set up by DNC, Clinton, and Obama.</p>

<p>I thought Trump won because the DNC put up a horrible candidate that bought and bribed her way to the nomination.</p>

<p>By the way, those of us that are genuine <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subscribers know who hacked the DNC, his name was Seth Rich.</p>

<p>One last question</p>

<p><strong>Why would Russia want Trump, when they were getting everything they wanted from Hillary?&quot;</strong></p>

If you mean just the average Joe, they may not believe the things we do, but look at the polling data. Americans do not trust the media. Far lower trust than other developed nations. As far as Trump goes, a lot of conservatives feel betrayed because he was supposed to drain the swamp and then he brought in a bunch of Wall Street hacks to be in his Cabinet and has done nothing to help us. Liberals don&#39;t like him for myriad reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if you rewrite that a few times you will come to a sort of answer. Start with &quot;It seems to me that&quot; because this is your perspective on it. &quot;It seems to me the every theory that goes against the media...&quot; Okay, you&#39;re going to have to define &quot;the media&quot; at that point. Then you you say it is &quot;labeled&quot; (by whom?) as a conspiracy theory.<br/>
Then remember that &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is a term used to make an idea sound crazy, when actually many conspiracies actually exist. The way we use language, the way we describe the world, affects how we see the world. The same way hypnotists use language we can easily hypnotize ourselves in the way we use language to describe our views.<br/>
But I think that many of the theories about Trump and Clinton both appear to be true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dissemination of false, misleading and fake news. </p>

<p>In conspiracy communities, we refer to what Russia orchestrated a &quot;psy op&quot; on the American electorate. Spreading of disinfo to foment distrust and division within the american populace.</p>

<p>They were very successful. This isn&#39;t hard. I don&#39;t know why people are so adamant it never happened, facts be damned. I haven&#39;t seen this level of denial since Russian backed rebels downed that airliner over Ukraine. </p>

<p>It&#39;s Russia. There&#39;s an <em>abundance</em> of corroboration. They are a foreign adversary. Our relations with them were not good and our sanctions were yielding very damaging results on their economy. </p>

<p>I honestly think the only reason people deny it happened is because it somehow reflects badly on Trump&#39;s win. And they have to defend Trump no matter what. Isreal does this. The US does this. Russia has done this in the past (funny how it was never disputed then, huh? Kinda lends credence to my theory about why it&#39;s being denied now). They did it in France. They did it in Germany. Theyve done it all over Eastern Europe. In fact, Eastern European former soviet states were instrumental in identifying Russian hallmarks on our own election.</p>

<p><em>Because they do this so fucking much to them those people have gotten good at detecting it</em>.</p>
