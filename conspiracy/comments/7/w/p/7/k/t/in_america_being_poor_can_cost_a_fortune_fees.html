<p>Marxist/Socialism is purposely vague and double meaning, by design. Furthermore, if you need a SSN or BIN to be employed or employe, then, yes... the government dos control the production and distribution of goods in the US, via statutes, code, and regulation. It&#39;s a quasi (Frankenstein) mix of Marxism/Socialism/Fascism. The main pillar behind Marxism/Socialism is central economic planning, though. Which we have, via the Federal Reserve. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The existence of an SSN doesn&#39;t give the government any say in what gets produced. There are laws that restrict what can be sold and how stuff can be made/sold, but that&#39;s missing the point entirely: The means of production and distribution belong to private individuals, and almost the entire market runs like that. Government contracts for instance don&#39;t mean that the government own the companies they&#39;re paying, it&#39;s strictly not government owned because they&#39;re handing the money over in exchange for already produced goods. </p>

<p>And you can say the main pillar is planning all you want, but with private ownership of the means of production there can be no socialist/communist style planning, just planning that exists in a market environment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t mean anything unless the government forces you to make something specific. You&#39;re free to pursue whatever job you&#39;d like, or no job at all. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s address the real issue though: If the government owns the means of production, someone can&#39;t just decide to start up their own business doing what they want because in a government run system, the government has ownership of everything required to properly run production. In our current system, I can start a business and purchase machinery or land I might need. Is there regulation? Sure. But (aside from certain cases) I&#39;m not buying it from the government. The government can deny me some sort of proper certification due to meeting some standards but that&#39;s on me. What they can&#39;t do is deny me the ability to start production of something I want because it&#39;s not in their plans. And the lack of that is what should tell you we don&#39;t live under socialism, communism, or any collective ownership system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am aware of that fact.  That is one aspect that the Government controls, kinda.  The Federal Reserve is as much a private enterprise as it is a Government one.  However, that&#39;s still only one aspect of the economy.  </p>

<p>Zoning laws are actually a far bigger way the Government &quot;controls&quot; the economy, as is regulation.  </p>

<p>Even still, the Government doesn&#39;t tell companies how much product they&#39;re allowed to produce.  It also doesn&#39;t force companies to produce certain goods that the Government thinks is in the best interest of the citizenry.  Those are the types of contol and planning that are hallmarks of Communist countries.</p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t, because all of those things are already done properly privately. </p>

<p>Also, If you&#39;re going by Marxist philosophy, Socialism isn&#39;t the stepping stone from Capitalism to Communism. Communism is the stepping stone from Capitalism to Socialism. </p>

<p>Wait... Wat?  You&#39;re going to need to explain this, because, Marx never said that... Are you coining this definition? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The currency does not make up the whole of our economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You can only buy things Federal Reserve notes, and those are regulated by the government, and the FED.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m a capitalist. I&#39;m just against unfettered Capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you&#39;re not a Capitalist. You just hide under the name, or are ignorant? Glad we got that out of the way...</p>

<p>Anyways, man... We can agree to disagree, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m not looking for a long drawn out argument on my Saturday night. You are cherry picking and denying certain things. </p>

<p>I&#39;m arguing for an actual free market.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and you&#39;re arguing that the U.S. is pure socialism.</p>

<p>There is no Socialism lite, as per Marx. The US is a Socialist country, which is the stepping stone from Capitalism to Communism. Basic definition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s far more capitalist than socialist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How? The currency/economy is planned centrally by the Federal Reserve. That is Socialism. Just because the US is shit, does not mean you can cry: &quot;No true Socialism&quot;. </p>
