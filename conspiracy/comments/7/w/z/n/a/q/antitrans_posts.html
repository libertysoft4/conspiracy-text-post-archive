<p>I saw a post here that insist transgenderism is not a real concept. this one below</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7wyizn/2018_olympic_gamesif_you_were_born_a_man_but/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7wyizn/2018_olympic_gamesif_you_were_born_a_man_but/</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how it even got to the second page and has a positive vote. </p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly new to the sub and looked at other post regarding transgenderism. they also look very anti-trans, with even more positive votes. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3iy9ri/johns_hopkins_psychiatrist_transgender_is_mental/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3iy9ri/johns_hopkins_psychiatrist_transgender_is_mental/</a>

<p>my question is what&#39;s up with the anti-trans agenda fix here? there&#39;s nothing wrong with being transgender. it is a real phenomenon. only problem I see here would be transgender children and what not. anything beyond that seems like personal opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, to answer your question specifically, it is probably the &quot;runoff&quot; anger from the agenda that actually does exist. Along with the typical &quot;division&quot; that is pushed in general. Another factor that is exemplified purposely is the fear, the fear of anything different. </p>

<p>As an adult, the natural right is that a person may do whatever, or whoever, they please so long as it doesn&#39;t hurt another being. A person has free will and therefore has the right to do whatever they want within the bounds of not hurting another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care what adults do. They can take all the hormones and have all the surgeries they want. I don&#39;t even care if a teenager identifies however they want and dresses however they want. </p>

<p>It when it gets pushed that hormone blockers and hormones are necessary for young kids, and if you disagree then you&#39;re a bigot and a transphobe, that&#39;s where the line gets drawn. There is an agenda, and it&#39;s not just about kids, though that&#39;s the worst part of it. </p>

<p>The fact is trans people are a tiny part of the population, and humans are visual. If you look like a woman, people assume youre a woman. No one cares about cross dressing either. Hell, look at hair bands in the 80&#39;s. It was cool for men to have long hairsprayed hair and wear makeup. Nobody cares. You should ask yourself why it&#39;s been turned into this gigantic movement with schools even starting mandatory education programs about gender identity for young kids, like in Canada. </p>

<p>No one has a right to be accepted. You can&#39;t force people to accept you. No one has a right to not have their feelings hurt. Why is so much of a lot of trans people&#39;s identities dependent on whether people accept them or not? </p>

<p>There&#39;s a trans guy (female to male) at my work. He acts like a dude, dresses like a dude, and doesn&#39;t ever talk about the fact that he&#39;s trans. He works in shipping throwing boxes, and everyone treats him like a man. I forget he&#39;s even trans most of the time. The only time he&#39;s ever talked about it is in the interview where I hired him, and his first day he said to everyone (in a joking manner) &quot;Hey, I&#39;m trans, got a problem with that, then deal with it.&quot; He has no problem being accepted because he&#39;s not out rubbing everyone&#39;s faces in how much he&#39;s trans and doesn&#39;t demand acceptance. He&#39;s just a dude, and no one cares.</p>

<p>You have to ask yourself why more trans people aren&#39;t like the guy at my work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re definitely entitled to your opinion. My opinion is that threads like those promote an echo chamber of stupidity consisting of people who don’t know the difference between words like anyway and any way claiming to know the scientific implications of transsexuality.</p>

<p>But by all means speak your mind. Better here where maybe someone can break the echo chamber and pout out how crazy these beliefs are.</p>

<p>Do some research and maybe you’ll see that mental illness is at best one of many possible causes for transsexuality.</p>

<p>That&#39;s literally the single most offensive thing you can say to a trans person, so no, you&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s fine if you feel that way, but to say that to a trans person is the definition of the word &quot;offensive&quot;. You don&#39;t get to decide what offends someone else, whether you find that offense to be valid or not. That&#39;s not how that works.</p>

<p>Why would i walk up and say it to a trans person? Having an opinion on something doesnt mean that I don&#39;t know how to behave on a human level. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t get to decide what offends someone else
I&#39;m certain some trans people would be offended by it and you&#39;re right, i dont get to decide... which is why i clearly said that <strong>I</strong> dont think it&#39;s too offensive.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a trans person gets offended reading this, they can be assured of a polite explanation should they ask. Since i&#39;ve only ever met 1 trans person, they expose me to differing points of view, to my own.</p>

<p>In case you&#39;re interested, I&#39;m not using mental illness as an attack or put down. I just think that a disassociation comes from the mind. I dont categorize it as something that can be &#39;fixed&#39; with pills. As i said in my original post, if transitioning makes someone a happier person then thats great for them. They&#39;d have my full support.</p>

<p>Given some of the more extreme reactions to the OPs post. I&#39;m very surprised you&#39;ve decided to come at me that way, I&#39;m offering an extremely moderate point of view and the opposition to trans people disgusts me. </p>

<p>My opinion is my opinion, not a weapon.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very common misconception that gender is the same as sex. Sex is the biological aspects of a person (male or female, as you&#39;re well aware); gender, however, is simply the intangible ideas of societal roles (man or woman) and identities that go along with a person.</p>

Transgenderism is a mental illness and should be treated as one. Just as you don&#39;t play along the game of imaginary friends of someone who has personality disorder, you can not expect me to call you a woman when you are a dude. Transgender people should seek professional help, and no the usual answer that says &quot;the only solution is transition&quot; is bullcrap since you can not cure mental illness with plastic surgery.<br/>
No one gives two shits about what you are doing in your own room, but don&#39;t force others to accept your mental illness in public.<br/>

Most people now see sexuality as a spectrum.</p>

<p>I guess people aren&#39;t able to accept that a tiny percentage of the seven billion are born feeling as if they are the opposite sex.
I imagine it has always been around, just not understood like it is today. Would love to know if there are any cases of transsexualism in the history books. </p>

<p>I know trans people on both sides, and apart from them being born one sex, there is not a single feminine/masculine aspect of their personality. You would never know that they were born as the opposite sex.

<p>I honestly have no issue at all with transmen.  They seem to be living their lives.  I have SERIOUS issues with a move towards self ID.  I also can not stand the transwomen activists that shout at lesbians that they are transphobic because they don&#39;t want to date someone with a dick and seem to think the world revolves around them.  It tends to be these transwomen who have no dysphoria associated with their penis and also these that demand access to shelters for women that exclude transwomen who have not undergone surgery to offer refuge to females who have been raped.  What kind of narcissist DEMANDS access to a place that is dedicated to being a safe refuge from males?  Do you really need the world to validate you so much that you think your own feelings are somehow superior in that situation?  Go fuck yourself with your lady dick  &amp; go compete in female races because in reality everyone knows you have a male penis and you only won the race because you are a male.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Transgenderism is a mental instability that causes the individual to hate themselves so much they go through tremendous physical corrective surgery just to be something other than they are not. Its fucked up but we live in a world where people can be who ever they want to be. Even though that saying was always used for professions and job related titles but never meant to change biology or gender or race lile these idiots think they can today.
Sorry if a soldier gets half his body blown off amd survives but has no penis, we will still call him a man. But when some Joe Jinglehimerschmit thinks we should all call him Tiffany now because he had his dick inverted into his body , that is when I say Fuck that guy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re definitely entitled to your opinion. My opinion is that threads like those promote an echo chamber of stupidity consisting of people who don’t know the difference between words like anyway and any way claiming to know the scientific implications of transsexuality.</p>

<p>But by all means speak your mind. Better here where maybe someone can break the echo chamber and pout out how crazy these beliefs are.</p>

<p>Do some research and maybe you’ll see that mental illness is at best one of many possible causes for transsexuality.</p>

<p>I do think its a mental illness. And i dont think that&#39;s too offensive to say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s literally the single most offensive thing you can say to a trans person, so no, you&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s fine if you feel that way, but to say that to a trans person is the definition of the word &quot;offensive&quot;. You don&#39;t get to decide what offends someone else, whether you find that offense to be valid or not. That&#39;s not how that works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps it is because the shelter is geared towards people with vaginas who have been violently assaulted by people with penises by using natural strength advantage to insert said penis into various orificies on woman causing immense emotional trauma.</p>

<p>IF you are SO narcissistic that you need to stick your lady cock into a shelter designed for terrifed and abused women, have at it.  You will see your support diminish quickly and rightfully so.</p>

<p>It is not the mandate of society to validate your existence, and it is certainly not the responsibility of a rape refuge to do so.   </p>

<p>Seriously?  What kind of sick pervert SUES a shelter to demand they hire them because they are a woman with a dick?</p>
