        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is all the evidence I have compiled on Paul McCartney being replaced by a double.</p>

<p>There is an important motive for the intelligence agencies replacing him.</p>

<h1>Paul wants to do music for JFK documentary</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Mark Lane said Paul wanted to write the score for the movie, “Rush to Judgment.” Lane’s book raised many questions about the official story of the JFK assassination. If Paul had been involved, many more people would have seen the movie. The more people who questioned the official story, the harder it would have been for the powers that be to keep the lie alive. I think the Elite panicked when they found out Paul wanted to be involved in exposing the truth. I think they decided Paul could not be allowed to write the score.</p>

<p>The LA press conference was Faul’s debut as “Paul McCartney.” The press conference was very odd. Reporters made mention of doubles, John and Faul made cryptic remarks about not being the real deals</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of evidence that he has been replaced:</p>

<h1>His long time girlfriend spoke of an awful betrayal</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>“Something so awful happened. Someone I’d loved for a long time I found out had betrayed me immensely. And I don’t mean infidelity or anything like that. Like, beyond belief. People don’t want to know what the truth is because they could never ever handle it. They would be too devastated.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Skull differences that can only be explained by doubles</h1>

<p>There are differences in the skull, palate etc. which cannot be explained due to ageing. The analysis was undertaken by experts who were initially skeptical of Paul being replaced.</p>

<p><a href="http://jamesfetzer.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/why-ringos-confession-we-replaced-paul_11.html">http://jamesfetzer.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/why-ringos-confession-we-replaced-paul_11.html</a></p>

<h1>DNA doesn&#39;t match</h1>

<p>There are court cases where children of Paul McCartney have sued for child support and the DNA test suggests either the children are lying, or Paul has been replaced with a genetically different person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1962, when the Beatles were living in Hamburg, Germany and still unknown to most people, Paul McCartney had a brief affair with a German woman named Erika Wohlers. She gave birth to a daughter, Bettina, in December 1962, which was during the time the Beatles were starting to become famous. The Beatles soon left Germany, and McCartney abandoned Erica. Around 1967 McCartney agreed to pay 30,000 deutsche marks to support Bettina, but he was not admitting to being her father, even though she claims her German birth certificate identifies him as her father!</p>

<p>Once Bettina became an adult, she asked a German court to have McCartney recognize her as his natural daughter. McCartney had to submit to a DNA test, and the test showed that he was not her father. Interestingly, based on an autograph signed by McCartney, together with some photos taken for the occasion, Bettina accused the person who took that DNA test of being a substitute for Paul, not the real Paul McCartney! The autograph, for instance, was signed by somebody right-handed (Paul was left-handed).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you believe Paul McCartney was replaced? What other evidence is there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be very difficult to exactly replicate that scar because he got it by tearing his lip open when he crashed his moped and then having a drunk doctor stitch him up because he didn&#39;t want to go to hospital, then it healed wrong and very slowly. For a while it was very swolen and looked like <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-72nuwgxma4o/UI0Rpozki-I/AAAAAAAAAEs/A0ahzYQgStA/s1600/paperback+chippy.jpg">this</a> until it healed into that scar which went inwards instead of stuck out. It would be near impossible to give someone an identical scar in the space of about a week when the first one took months to end up looking like that. There&#39;s no period in 66 or 67 when his scar looks swollen or changes in any way, and there&#39;s thousands of pictures and videos of him during that time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it&#39;s true they were at their best together, McCartney was the better talent. Better vocal range, wider range of vocal tonality, broader ability as an instrumentalist (which made his writing contributions more substantial, particularly in his bassline writing), broader range of themes in lyrics and music, got deeper into production and was overall more creative from a production standpoint.</p>

<p>The best Beatles songs are mostly the McCartney-led ones.</p>

<p>That said, my favorite Beatles might be A Day in the Life, since it perfectly showcases the brilliance of their respective styles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. The sax lick at the end of Jet is the opposite of presumptuous, it was an artist being an artist in an unexpected or unconventional manner.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not doing anything worthwhile then maybe abandonment of convention is presumptuous,  but if hundred bands are influenced by you and copy what you did differently because it affected them... Then you are a literal trendsetter. </p>

<p>Pretty sure Quincy Jones is off his rocker because he signed Jacob Collier a few years ago and it fractured his psyche a little bit. He&#39;s still trying to make sense of his life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>whoa whoa whoa, now I agree the Faul evidence is compelling, and you forgot Mal Evans, George calling him Faul, Revolution 9 backwards, a bunch of shit from post Beatle era; but I must inject myself immediately at this: what world is Ringo or Paul weak?! Ringo was the best drummer in Liverpool, a seasoned pro, and despite being the reason most drummers played match grip instead of traditional back then, his tempos, beats and understanding of feel as well as fills are widely recognized. Plus, he&#39;s frigging Ringo. Received the most fan mail, was the abassador of LA through the 70&#39;s, and speaking as both a drummer and as someone who has met him, he&#39;s the shit. No one else could play &quot;Girl&quot; or &quot;In My Life&quot; or any other of the Beatle catalog like him. His ability to play to the song and his fills which start on the left hand (despite being on a right kit-a tricky and unique style) make his parts on &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; or &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; especially complex, depite their simplistic sound. 
As far as Paul (Discounting post Revolver songs), he played guitar, piano, drums, bass (which he is IMHO the gold standard as far as rock bassists are concerned. His lines are without equal in theor melodic, complexity and nuance), he wrote &quot;I&#39;ll Follow the Sun&quot; at 16, dreampt &quot;Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and wrote songs like &quot;Michelle&quot;, &quot;For No One&quot;, &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ve Just Seen A Face&quot; and on and on and on...I mean, he&#39;s the guy who PUSHED Lennon&#39;s genius and in the early years (63-66)Lennon&#39;s work ethic. NOW, the case for Faul is also mnade with Lennon&#39;s drop in productivity and leadership after 66/67, but if Faul is real, then The BEatles were lucky enough to have Paul McCartney AND Faul who was Paul, on steroids. On top of Lennon, Harrison, Starkey, 192 songs in 7 years, over 1.4 BILLION units sold and the reason most music anyone enjoys in any genre exists, between the innovations with 5th Beatle George Martin in the studio (I mean, Sgt Pepper was on a fucking 4 Track!) and the catalog....BEATLES.GOAT. Not even debatable. </p>

<p>Great post though. \m/</p>

<p>&quot;The only thing I couldn&#39;t cure myself of was being left-handed. I do everything with my left hand, and no matter how I try I can&#39;t change the habit. I just seem to do everything back to front. I used to even write backwards. Every time the schoolmasters would look at my handwriting they would throw swinging fits.&quot;  </p>

<ul>
<li>Paul McCartney  [from a 1963 interview]</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is Paul himself, in his own words and before his alleged death, telling us that he is a devout leftie and that everything he does is with his left hand.  Why is it then that in spite of this, there are a number of occurances after 1966 where Paul is picking up and/or holding objects with his right hand? </p>

<p>There is an unusual scene in the Anthology 7 video / DVD where Paul is shown playing guitar right handed. The particular scene can be found approximately 50 minutes in where Paul is talking about writing the song &#39;I Will&#39;. This particular song is playing as the scenes are shown. Of course we have to ask why Paul is playing right-handed here. According to the story, Paul&#39;s replacement William Campbell was a right-handed guitar play who had to learn how to play left-handed for public appearences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He said he can play passably the other way around because everyone elses guitars have always been right handed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had to learn backwards. I can play right-handed guitar a bit, just enough for at parties. Hopefully, by that point everyone is drunk when I pick it up, because otherwise they&#39;re going to catch me. But I could do that, and the guys obviously wouldn&#39;t let me restring it. Certainly, they wouldn&#39;t let me gouge out their nuts. And at a party, you only want to play it for 15 or 30 minutes or so, and by the time you&#39;ve goofed up their guitar and you hand it back to them, they&#39;ve got to string it back again, and it&#39;s silly. So I had to learn upside down. It&#39;s funny: John learned upside down, too, because of me-because mine was the only other guitar around for him, if he broke a string or didn&#39;t have his. That&#39;s more unusual; left-handed guys can nearly always play a straight guitar. Actually, Robbie is very accomplished that way. He can do both. He can actually play pretty well: [in a stage voice] Dirty swine! The rest of us can just play passably, but he&#39;s actually pretty good the wrong way around.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>After the mid-1970s disclosures from the Rockefeller Commission about how much academic research into LSD had been funded or monitored by the CIA, some leading figures from the 1960s counterculture began reassessing what role the CIA may have played in the formation of their movement.  The first major public statements in the 1970s by countercultural figures to speculate on the relationship between the CIA and LSD occurred at an October 1977 conference at the University of California, Santa Cruz titled LSD: A Generation Later.  Allen Ginsberg, who compared the conference to an acidhead &quot;class reunion,&quot; said, &quot;Am I, Allen Ginsberg, the product of one of the CIA&#39;s lamentable, ill-advised, or triumphantly successful experiments in mind control?  Had they by conscious plan or inadvertent Pandora&#39;s Box, let loose the whole LSD fad on the U.S. &amp; the World?&quot; </p>

<p>LSD guru Tim Leary, who was also at the conference, addressed questions about the LSD/CIA issue with much more mischievious intent.  Leary said, &quot;The LSD movement was started by CIA.  I wouldn&#39;t be here now without the foresight of the CIA scientists.  It was no accident. It was all planned and scripted by Central Intelligence, and I&#39;m all in favor of Central Intelligence.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy, this is a personal favorite conspiracy of mine. In fact, this was really the first conspiracy I ever got into and wasted many hours of my preteen years studying it.

Although his appearance does change drastically throughout the late 60s, there are still key elements that match, especially all the subconscious ticks he retains in interviews that you simply can&#39;t teach a double. </p>

<p>I do believe that the clues and symbols put into their music and album covers were deliberate and they stemmed from a harmless infatuation with the occult </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have the exact timeline down but the time between Paul&#39;s death and the first filmed appearance of the &quot;double&quot; is very small, a month or less IIRC. Being able to find someone who looks and sounds like him, and is able to mimic the same subconscious ticks in such a short amount of time is impossible. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5WwaHyR-w8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5WwaHyR-w8</a></p>

<p>This video compares an interview of Paul from August 1966 to one in January 1967. Depending on which version of the rumor you believe, there is only 3-5 months between his supposed death and the Jan. 1967 interview. Listen to the way he speaks in these interviews, watch how he moves his head when talking and how he uses his hands when speaking. This is obviously the same guy. How is it possible, in a space of 3-5 months, to find a person who looks identical to Paul, sounds exactly like Paul, get him to abandon his old life, take care of any loose ends involving friends, family and anyone else who might have known him (because he certainly would have been a local celebrity for his more than striking resemblance to one of the most popular musicians on the planet) and train him to mimic all the subtle ticks the old Paul had. Don&#39;t forget all the time you have to factor in for recording and writing music, which this newbie must have been exceptionally talented in if one of the first songs he records with the group is Penny Lane, released in February 1967. </p>

<p>When looking at the timeline, I simply see no possible point where a double could have entered the picture. </p>

<p>There were Paul McCartney look alike competitions. The intel agencies could have planned it for months.</p>

<p>How do you know subconcsious ticks can&#39;t be programmed in using hypnosis etc?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The look alike competitions are mentioned a lot, but no one ever seems to have a source to prove any were held. </p>

<p>We can get into the weeds and talk about whether or not his death was planned out but I think its pointless as you can&#39;t offer up any conclusive proof of that claim. I don&#39;t deny that the CIA could easily program people, but I don&#39;t think they could program in the musical abilities and whimsical creativity needed to compose a song like Penny Lane, which came out less than a year after Paul&#39;s supposed death.</p>

<p>Also, when do you believe Paul died? The most common dates are either September 11th or November 9th 1966, depending on if you use the U.S or British date system to decipher the hidden message on the Sgt Pepper drum. So yeah, the August 1966 interview would be the original Paul. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>REALITY: Such a contest was actually held, co-sponsored by an American teen magazine (perhaps &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;?) and Dick Clark of the TV show &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. The winner of this 1965 contest was Keith Allison, who had a brief brush with fame on teen shows such as &quot;Where The Action Is&quot; and apparently later joined Paul Revere and the Raiders, circa 1966. The real Paul <em>does</em> have a faint scar on his upper lip from the above-mentioned motorcycle accident. No William Campbell ever won a Paul look-alike contest.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know when he died but the article I linked said they were talking about doubles (the beatles and reporters) in August therefore I think you should be comparing pre 1965 interviews and post 1967 interviews.</p>

<p>“When Paul died, we all panicked!” claims Ringo, obviously very emotional. “We didn’t know what to do, and Brian Epstein, our manager, suggested that we hire Billy Shears as a temporary solution. It was supposed to last only a week or two, but time went by and nobody seemed to notice, so we kept playing along. Billy turned out to be a pretty good musician and he was able to perform almost better than Paul. The only problem was that he couldn’t get along with John, at all.”</p>

<p>After MJ died Sony exercised the option to purchase the 25% of MJ&#39;s 50%.  They also negotiated with MJ&#39;s estate to purchase the other 25% of the 50.  So now Sony owns 100%.</p>

<p>People went fucking insane over the Beatles, and like even I enjoy their music but there seemed to be something more to it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know right. Wonder if the mass hysteria at the concerts was created through EMR mind control or something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A key element in the creation of America’s drug counterculture was “The Grateful Dead,” a rock band that passed out LSD to people attending its concerts in the 1960’s. At their concerts listeners were encouraged to take LSD and to “tune in, turn on, and drop out.” An expression that instructed the LSD takers to abandon the modern world and join what McKenna coined the “archaic revival.”</p>

<p>There is a recording of Dr. Timothy Leary actually describing the retrograde culture that those who dropped out would participate in:
. In this talk, Leary, Alan Watts, Alan Ginsberg, Gary Snyder and Allen Cohen describe how those that “tune in, turn on, drop out” would abandon modern culture and return to the status of a peasant.</p>

<p><strong>It is important to note that marketing and PR expert Marshal McLuhan, who had a strong influence on Leary and later McKenna, is the one who actually developed the expression “Tune in, turn on, and drop out”:</strong></p>

<p>In a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, Leary stated that slogan was &quot;given to him&quot; by Marshall McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary added that McLuhan &quot;was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, “Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that&#39;s a lot,” to the tune of a Pepsi commercial. Then he started going, “Tune in, turn on, and drop out.”[14]</p>

<p><strong>It is also notable that two individuals associated with the Grateful Dead were once employees of the CIA’s MK-ULTRA program--band member and lyricist Robert Hunter [15], and author Ken Kesey[16] whose “Merry Pranksters” were often at the Grateful Dead shows promoting LSD use to the “Deadheads.” Kesey’s novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest promoted the archaic revival by concluding with a heroic American Indian escaping from modern tyranny and returning to a primitive culture. Furthermore, Grateful Dead song writer John Perry Barlow, in 2002, admitted in a Forbes magazine interview ironically titled “Why Spy?” that he spent time at CIA headquarters at Langley.[17]</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Beatlmania&quot; was largely contrived though; their record label hired busloads of girls to come scream for The Beatles. McCartney wasn&#39;t a threat to the system anymore than Lennon was a political threat. They always played ball and helped to promote the New Age, wrote the psychedelic soundtrack for CIA drugs, and promoted Crowleyean morals of sexual liberation free from Christian influence. Lennon&#39;s death is still very suspicious, and like all hippy music, The Beatles have a strong occult influence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>William Campbell is the supposed double. Aka Billy Shears. Considering this is a conspiracy you’re putting forward it’s something you really should know. I just checked the wiki for the Paul is dead theory and his name is there.</p>

<p>I haven’t got any interest in looking further into it because I think it’s implausible for the CIA to go to go to such great lengths with a British act based on Britain performing under a British label to replace Paul when the band had already replaced Pete Best with Ringo, plus the evidence suggested is circumstantial at best. </p>

<p>DNA is he said she said, then the test came out negative, end of story. We only know what was said, not what happened or who her mother was seeing at the time.</p>

<p>Ears should only be inspected along the top and the even then his ears appear consistent in the photos I have seen. Another thing to consider is that the ears and nose continue to grow throughout our lives.</p>

<p>That said, I appreciate the offer and hope you enjoy the endeavour. It was a fun read for me, like the Avril Lavigne theory, even if I concluded a different outcome to yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t find Stalin’s double implausible. Stalin and Dadaev is a well known and accepted case of literal body double, but that’s not replacement. Churchill used a body double to represent him in the U.K. when he went to Africa to meet Stalin and FDR in Africa. He didn’t stay in the U.K. and send his double to meet Stalin’s double.</p>

<p>Hitler and Goebbels had doubles, too.  These are all well known cases of political decoys. </p>

<p>It’s a completely different situation. T here is a huge difference between world leaders having someone pretend to be them for security/secrecy and a foreigner being killed and replaced in entirety... by the CIA. </p>

<p>Unless you think Dadaev was a CIA plant, of course. That’s a truly mind boggling proposition.</p>

<p>But if the CIA were to replace a Beatle to stop subversive speech, why not Lennon over McCartney?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just read a much more plausible, if still, long shot theory that MI5 replaces Paul to prevent mass suicides by fans. But even that theory plays with dates, suggesting that the passenger of Paul’s crash was Heather Mills, who married McCartney in 2002. Problem with that being that Heather Mills was born two years after the crash.</p>

<p>If Ringo comes out publicly and says it’s true, then I would seriously consider it, but as things currently stand there is nothing remotely solid about the theory, not least the progression of McCartney’s song writing and subsequent post Beatles career.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder why no one ever suggests that the Paul McCartney disparity may be the result of a parallel universe slip? </p>

<p>It probably happens more than any of us care to imagine. But since McCartney is such a public figure (and so well-documented) it&#39;s just easier to track the little differences. Most of us aren&#39;t photographed and filmed as much.</p>

<p>I remember when David L. Wolper did his John Lennon documentary. He&#39;d previously done documentaries on historical figures, Presidents, actors etc. He said that he was shocked by how much more footage existed of the Beatles than of any one else.</p>

<p>So McCartney has been photographed from every conceivable angle. Whereas your mom hasn&#39;t been. Nor your teacher. Nor your neighbor from down the street.</p>

<p>So what if one of them went to sleep in one universe and woke up in another?</p>

<p>You&#39;d never know the difference, because the replacement (also from another universe) would be almost identical.</p>

<p>There was a woman in Spain who had a fascinating parallel universe slip experience: <a href="http://www.ghosttheory.com/2016/01/12/lerina-garcia-gordo-the-woman-from-a-parallel-universe">http://www.ghosttheory.com/2016/01/12/lerina-garcia-gordo-the-woman-from-a-parallel-universe</a></p>

<p>There are also millions of people who have been caught up in the so-called Mandela Effect (which is also suggestive of this phenomenon).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing: As crazy as this sounds, I really <em>do</em> suspect that the two Pauls are both authentically Paul. But that, technically, they are different people. Paul pre-1966 wrote guitar-based music. Paul after-1966 wrote mostly piano-based music.</p>

<p>Paul pre-1966 stood about 5&#39;8&#39;&#39;, whereas Paul after-1966 stood about 5&#39;11&#39;&#39;: <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ea/8a/29/ea8a2942f45dbd47b6130face39f7b65.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ea/8a/29/ea8a2942f45dbd47b6130face39f7b65.jpg</a></p>

<p>Their ears don&#39;t match when you align the profiles side by side: <a href="http://digilander.libero.it/jamespaul/show-case/profiles.jpg">http://digilander.libero.it/jamespaul/show-case/profiles.jpg</a></p>

<p>(In the latter picture, the bottom of the ear in pre-1966 Paul falls a little below his nose; whereas in after-1966 Paul, the ear is much higher up and tilted at a different angle. The skulls are also vastly different widths in profile. </p>

<p>Long story short: I think that Paul II is annoyed at the &quot;Paul is Dead&quot; rumors because, according to him, he&#39;s ALWAYS been Paul. (And so far as he knows that&#39;s 100% true.) He just hasn&#39;t &quot;always been Paul&quot; here. </p>

<p>Which leads to an interesting question: If &quot;our Paul&quot; is now I&#39;m Universe #2, what songs did he write over on that side post-1966 that we&#39;ve never heard?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I experienced a &quot;Mandela Effect&quot; episode years before the phenomenon had a name or was popularized. </p>

<p>I had a clear memory of politician Walter Mondale dying around 2003. Then I was reading a news article and saw Mondale allegedly writing an article about Barack Obama around 2012. At first I thought it was a joke. It had to be. Mondale had died.</p>

<p>I checked Wikipedia. And to my shock, it listed no death-date.</p>

<p>According to my memory, Mondale died about 6 months after Senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash. Panicked, the DNC rushed to try and fill the seat, so they recruited former vice-president Mondale to run for the open Senatorial slot. Instead Republican Norm Coleman won. And about six months after that, Mondale died.</p>

<p>I remembered my wife commenting, &quot;Good thing he didn&#39;t win; he would have died anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2012, and I&#39;m reading an article purportedly by Mondale. Freaked out, I test my wife. Without telling her the issue, I said &quot;Tell me what you know about Walter Mondale.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like what?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, he was Jimmy Carter&#39;s vice-president.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He ran for President against Reagan and lost.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He ran for Paul Wellstone&#39;s seat a few years back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He died. Why?&quot;</p>

<p>My eyes nearly started from my head. After drawing her out, and getting more details, her memories matched mine exactly. So I hadn&#39;t hallucinated it. Or misremembered.</p>

<p>I actually had back-up. Corroboration.</p>

<p>My wife and I also have vivid memories of Billy Graham dying and watching his funeral on TV. We both remember being freaked out at all the Presidents who had attended. We had no idea how powerful he was.</p>

<p>So imagine our shock when he turned up alive again.</p>

<p>That was my wife&#39;s first freak-out.</p>

<p>Both episodes happened before the &quot;Mandela Effect&quot; as a phrase or pop culture phenomenon came about.</p>

<p>So as much as I know the conventionalist would say, &quot;False memory&quot; or &quot;Coincidental recollection,&quot; etc., I know for a fact that that&#39;s a lazy copout non-explanation.</p>

<p>I know what I know. </p>

<p>And I suspect that parallel universe slips happen all the time. We&#39;re just generally not aware of them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that, now that we can document stuff, it&#39;s giving us more of a basis for comparison--and then the disparities start emerging. </p>
