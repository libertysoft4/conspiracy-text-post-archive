    <div class="md"><p>Well, the towers were nowhere near as secure as people believe. A group of Israeli art students, in the weeks leading up to the attacks, removed a window from their floor and built a box outside of it, after smuggling in construction equipment and lumber in the early morning hours. Here they are actually talking about it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was an outside job done by Israeli MOSSAD agents like the ones that were arrested on the day for carrying explosives in a van with a picture of a plane crashing into the WTC on the side of the van. </p>

<p>There are alleged pictures of “Israeli Art Students” with a ton of boxes believed to be explosives inside the WTC, and I believe they did detect thermite in the aftermath of it.</p>

<p>Also they allegedly found the pilots license of the terrorists as well as the terrorist bandana on the ground unscratched. How absurd is that it should have obviously burned up in the plane or the building.</p>

<p>There’s so much evidence on 9/11 I’m surprised anyone comes here to get an answer. YouTube has the answers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Let’s assume you’re right? Do you think it’s strange that Larry Silverstein bought the WTC not long before despite the fact that it was filled with asbestos that would cost more to clean than the building itself, but he did get a giant insurance policy. Also maybe the FBI why didn’t they ever charge Osama Bin Laden for the crime of 9/11? Why were the only people arrested on the day happen to be Israelis that were later deported quietly by Michael Chertoff who also helped draft the Patriot Act and these Jews were proven to be MOSSAD agents and failed lie detector tests. Huh strange right. Also the trillions of dollars that went missing. Building 7. Is all of this just crazy conspiracy jabber or might there be a nugget of truth? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How were they supposed to charge Osama with anything?<br/>
The people who did it were dead. You can&#39;t arrest dead people. It&#39;s not like they had any idea what was going on.<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure more than just those people were arrested on 9/11. Also, you have to actually connect them to 9/11. You can&#39;t just say they were involved.<br/>
What missing trillions? You mean the &quot;missing&quot; trillions?<br/>
Building 7 makes sense.<br/>
Most of it lacks truth, as I have demonstrated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is meaningless prattle!</p>

<p>ANY clear and verified evidence that TPTB - whoever and however - lied about 9/11 and covered it up is immediate cause for a special prosecutor, grand jury, a full, legal and public airing of everything and everybody involved, followed by a truth and reconciliation commission and jail time for the worst perpetrators.</p>

<p>NOT taking this remedy ASAP means we will continue to retain and accumulate the lethal poison in our already weakened political immune system. Demand 9/11 justice now!</p>
