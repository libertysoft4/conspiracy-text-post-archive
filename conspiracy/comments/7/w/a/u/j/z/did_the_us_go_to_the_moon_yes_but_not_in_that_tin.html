        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is my opinion that factions within the US government have had zero-point/anti-gravity devices since AT LEAST WW2.</p>

<p>Bottom Line: The US wanted to (convincingly) show up the Russians -- and the world. The rocket launches were legit, but no astronauts were inside.</p>

<p>Instead, Neil Armstrong (along with the &quot;Apollo Lander&quot;) were safely transported to the moon on a much larger, zeropoint cargo ship. The Apollo Lander was lowered by cable (and raised by cable) to simulate landing (and subsequent &quot;lunar liftoff&quot;).</p>

<p>Finally, &quot;splashdown&quot; did also occure -- definitely wanted to make sure those pinko commies saw a capsule on their radars! But no one was ever in the modules. The modules were empty -- released from the cargo ship in space. And then astronauts would simply appear for press conferences -- only to describe the dramatic experiences (but also in the form on a limited hangout -- yes, they go to the moon.... just not using really big firecrackers and gold-leafed moon buggies).</p>

<p>Yes, the US sent people to the moon. (And Mars. And other solar systems.) They want you to know they have superior technology -- but they don&#39;t want you know just HOW superior. (They want to think they got there on a rocket fueled by &quot;fossils&quot;. Nooooooope.)</p>

<p>Flat earthers believe in the simple laws of density and buoyancy. Anything more dense than air falls. Anything less dense than air rises. Anything denser than water sinks. Anything less dense than water floats. </p>

<p>Are things that float not subject to gravity? Please explain when gravity applies and when it does not apply and please show me the research that shows that the mass of an object can be used to attract the mass of another object. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To the indoctrinated, if gravity didn&#39;t exist we&#39;d float off into space. The cosmology that we are taught in school and are even exposed to before we reach year 5 is that we live on a ball in a vacuum called space. Once you break through the understanding that what you know was put there by so called authority then you will start to unlearn what you have learned. Education is not knowledge but part of the programming, all entertainment programming follows the same information that we are constantly feed throughout our entire lives. The system is a prison of comfort and the majority love their prison because it feeds them, entertains them, tells them what they can and can not do, tells them what is possible and what is not possible. It&#39;s the largest prison system you&#39;ll never see unless you wake up from the dream that we have all been put in since birth.</p>
