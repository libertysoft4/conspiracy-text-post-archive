    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that there was been no recovery under Obama. The 9 million lost jobs were never recovered, and job growth only kept up with inflation, which was unlike every other recovery (and was just like the Great Depression). Also, job numbers were even worse than they looked because good jobs were being lost under Obama and replaced with lower quality jobs. The rising stock market has been nothing more than inflation. The trillions being pumped into investment banks weren&#39;t going to drive up the price of bread as much as they drove up the price of stocks, but bread and everything else also inflated--just not as much as stocks.</p>

<p>I would much rather listen to someone who actually knows what they are talking about on a subject such as the economy than some random dude on the internet who claims that an under 15% inflation is responsible for a 200% increase in the size of the stock market.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta understand that inflation rate isn&#39;t the only big issue right now, but it will be in the future.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about INTEREST RATES! Obamas economy was propped up on low interest rates with extremely high deficits.</p>

<p>The problem is the recovery hasn&#39;t been all that great, and the dollar has been tanking, however the economy seemingly got better. Why!? You might ask, who wouldn&#39;t invest when you can get a 0% loan, who wouldn&#39;t live way above their means and buy a car they can&#39;t afford with a 0% loan? The answer - many people.</p>

<p>The problem is that inflation eventually catches up... sure the stock market is great but I believe if we leave the market on low interest for too long, the dollar will just become too weak, and inflation will speed up to the point where everything is extremely expensive (and that&#39;s slowly happening now). Regardless if hyperinflation doesn&#39;t kick in the weak dollar will be an extreme blow to overall confidence and businesses.</p>

<p>So now the federal reserve kept things good under Obama for 8 years, slowly raising them in the past year. Now because the economy (seemingly) is doing well, they anticipate a rate hike, you know your economies fucked where even the suggestion of a potential rate hike is throwing your economy into shambles.</p>
