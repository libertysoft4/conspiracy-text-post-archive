<p>I dont care where you sit on the whole russia phobia spectrum, but posting politically and propogandistically charged crap in advice animals has been happening for a while. </p>

<p>I distinctly remember there was no politics rule on that sub, but clearly it is gone. Like every other sell out media, even reddit is going down the propaganda path. I guess the powers that control reddit, and sold out to advertising and promotions (as we have seen on front page its a lot of product placement), they like much of the media now enforce political opinions, and no sub is safe (well I imagine subs that dont have critical numbers are safe, but general subs that everyone is subbed to are not). </p>

<p>Is this the end of reddit?</p>

<p>Is this the end of reddit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reddit has been dying for quite some time. Not numbers wise, but with its ideals. The site Aaron set out to create is long dead, and the 2016 election cycle proved it. Problem is, there seems to be little consensus on the &quot;next&quot; platform, so groups like this one still cling on to the fringes of the site. </p>

<p>In time, they will come for this community as well, just as they have so many others- r/sandersforpresident, r/politics, r/wikileaks, r/pizzagate. Alexis has stated they want to go public by 2020...r/conspiracy will not be aloud to stand as is, even with the insane shilling that increases on daily basis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s just reddit. Twitter and Facebook are very political now. It&#39;s hard to avoid. There was a saying &quot;never talk religion or politics at the dinner table&quot; now politics is all anyone talks about, that common courtesy not not bringing up politics is gone. I feel it&#39;s more to do with the internet and people being able to say what they&#39;re thinking without repercussions, you didn&#39;t used to be able to do that. </p>

<p>The admins are ordered by their parent company to manipulate algorithms, give weight to certain sets of controlled narratives and groups to favor the profit motives of stake holders within the company. </p>

<p>Reddit is absolutely game the same as any commercial media platform. Reddit hurting for cash is a myth and an excuse. If Reddit was hurting for cash, then why take up being an even greater content delivery network with file hosting rather than just a link aggregator and message forum? Wouldn&#39;t hosting images and video dramatically increase costs? </p>

<p>Reddit isn&#39;t hurting for cash because the investors who own this media platform profit off controlling the narrative to steer views and bodies towards a certain narrative that fits their profit motive. That is why political bot nets are allowed to operate and why major subs seem to be a broken record. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In April 2014, the Associated Press uncovered a secret operation by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to create a Twitter-like social media platform through cellphones to evade Havana’s strict information controls and censorship of the Internet. It was called ZunZuneo, based on Cuban slang for a hummingbird’s tweet. The plan was to build a subscriber base for the network by pushing news updates on noncontroversial topics like soccer, music, and incoming hurricanes. Once the network had a solid subscriber base, it started to introduce explicitly political material in the hopes of organizing political flash mobs and causing a “Cuban Spring.” At its height, the network had around 40,000 subscribers, none of whom were aware that ZunZuneo was funded by the United States government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The top comment thread is like a microcosm of what has been happening in r/conspiracy for the last year. Garbage anti-Trump content gets mysteriously upvoted to the top because anti-Trump, the top comment is neutral and expresses concern for the quality of content and how it is seeking a lowest common political denominator, and then the sub upvotes a condescending remark labling the concern as a &quot;leak from T_D&quot; because it doesn&#39;t tow the line of groupthink.</p>

<p>Fuck Trump, and fuck these rabid anti-Trumpers.</p>
