        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been interested in the allegations that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons (CW&#39;s) during the Syrian Civil War, and have been examining information for some time, trying to piece things together for a clearer understanding of what has been going on, and why. </p>

<p>Sources on details of the attacks hard to come by, and I used the most reliable I was able to find (mostly Wikipedia and the Lancet... if anyone knows of better sources, please post links)</p>

<p>I am nowhere near finished putting all this together, but given the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7we6tb/us_sec_of_defense_mattis_admits_there_was_no/">&quot;we have no evidence&quot;</a> bombshell recently dropped by Secretary of Defense Mattis, I could see that there is much confusion and misunderstanding on these matters, so I&#39;m posting what I have now. </p>

<p>(<em>Note: I have not had time to fully proofread all of the material, so if there are errors</em>, <strong><em>(mea culpa!)</em></strong>, <em>please let me know so I can fix.</em>)</p>

<p><strong>The evidence I have found so far has shocked me</strong>. There have been far fewer incidents of alleged CW use than I had imagined, and the number of persons reportedly killed or injured by such weapons is far lower than I had expected to find.</p>

<p>Here is the data I have compiled so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The number of deaths from CW&#39;s is lower that I expected:</strong> The total number of deaths in the Syrian war, civilian and combatant, is estimated at 400,000, while the total number of deaths attributed to chemical weapons is <em>1,020</em> -- <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ECrLhPB.png">0.26% of the total.</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Civilian CW casualties are magnitudes higher than are combatant casualties</strong>: with death rates at <strong>254/1</strong> and injury rates at <strong>14/1</strong>, respectively. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QtSJHOc.png">See here for the figures</a>, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8qR330k.png">and here for a better visualization</a>. Hell of a way to run a war, no?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regarding civilian casualties, the number reportedly caused by CW&#39;s is surprisingly small</strong>. In January 2018, The peer-reviewed <strong><em>Lancet</em></strong>, <em>&quot;one of the world&#39;s oldest and best known general medical journals&quot;</em>, published the following: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X17304692">Patterns of civilian and child deaths due to war-related violence in Syria: a comparative analysis from the Violation Documentation Center dataset, 2011–16</a> <em>(Note: The deaths reported ALL occurred in areas that were NOT under the control of Assad or the Syrian government)</em>  Only about 1% were attributed to chemical weapons. I created a pie chart to help visualize the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KUU33bN.png">number of deaths by cause.</a> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>On the whole, the chemical weapons reportedly used in Syria have NOT been very effective</strong> at killing and maiming. Of the 69  incidents recorded on Wikipedia, 28 (40%) <em>didn&#39;t kill or injure anyone</em>. Here is a bar chart illustrating the numbers of reported <a href="https://i.imgur.com/U8Gaczw.png">deaths and injuries to both civilians and combatants.</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>92% of all reported civilian deaths occurred in only 3 instances</strong>: The infamous twin attacks in Ghouta (August 21, 2013) accounted <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Y9f94cQ.png">for <strong>837</strong> deaths,</a> and the Khan Shaykhun incident in April 2017 for an estimated <strong>100</strong> more. The remaining 79 reported deaths were spread out over the other 66 reported incidents, giving these an average of ~1.2 deaths per incident.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Of the few military/combatant casualties that were reported, Assad&#39;s forces had the highest number</strong>, reporting 1 death and 66 injuries. These were followed by Kurdish forces, who suffered 3 deaths and 12 injuries. The rebel Free Syrian Army <em>(Assad&#39;s enemies)</em> reported ZERO deaths and 2 injuries. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/T7WagFO.png">See here.</a> <em>(And we are told that Assad uses these things because he is &quot;desperate&quot;?)</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regarding the different chemicals allegedly used</strong>, Sarin has been the deadliest, with 937 deaths and 53 injuries reported <em>(see above)</em>. Second prize goes to chlorine, which, has reportedly been used on about 30 occasions <em>(5 times more often than Sarin)</em>, but is responsible for only 18 reported deaths, and 312 injuries (all civilian). For more details, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DRHpMP9.png">see the chart here.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>SOURCES: </p>

<p>Primarily the Wikipedia page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_chemical_weapons_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War#Reported_chemical_weapons_attacks">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_chemical_weapons_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War#Reported_chemical_weapons_attacks</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/tscJalc.png">Here is a screen shot I took of the Wiki page to try to decipher the details.</a> The chicken scratches you see in color are the marks and notes I made as I struggled to tally catalog and categorize. I have found and fixed some of my errors, there are likely some that I overlooked. At the bottom is a legend explaining the notes, and an explanation on how victims were tallied.</p>

<p>The other source is the Lancet:  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X17304692">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X17304692</a></p>

<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong></p>

<p>From my the info above and my observations over the course of the war... <strong><em>I suspect</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>That <em>the overall public perception</em> of the number of deaths and injuries caused by CW use in Syria (by Assad&#39;s forces, or anyone else) is grossly inflated and flawed.</p></li>
<li><p>That <em>this flawed public perception is not organic</em>, but is the product of an intentional propaganda campaign conceived by western governments/intelligence agencies, and entrenched into the public mind with the willing cooperation of major western media organs.</p></li>
<li><p>That the goal of this deceptive misrepresentation was (is) to change public opinion to favor/accept western intervention in the Syrian war.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Moreover, I suspect that the motive for misleading us is the same that compelled them to lie about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein&#39;s (non-existent) <em>&quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;</em>: <strong><em>Powerful players have long wanted regime change in Syria</em></strong>, as they wanted (and got) in Iraq and Libya, but that isn&#39;t likely to happen without direct western intervention, and THAT isn&#39;t going to happen if they can&#39;t find a way to get public support, so in their minds, they must find a way to convince a war-weary and skeptical public public that they need to support direct western intervention in Syria so that its &quot;monster&quot; of a leader and his evil regime can be put down.</p>

<p>Chemical weapons suck on the battlefield, but the mere mention of these are a <strong><em>major</em></strong> trigger of emotion and reflexive repulsion in the human mind. So for propaganda purposes, CW&#39;s can be a <strong><em>Tzar Bomba!</em></strong>, or, at least that&#39;s what the Big Players are hoping for.</p>

<p>Keep your eye on the puppets and the pawns, and mind the False Flags. The ones they&#39;ve pulled in Syria have failed, so we shouldn&#39;t be surprised if someone conveniently linked to (Syria, Lebanon, Russia <strong><em>IRAN</em></strong>) should strike using CW&#39;s in Europe, the US, or maybe South Korea?</p>

<p>God forbid. </p>

<p>Spread the word. The more the people know, the less power they have to manipulate us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the most fucked up part is how easy it is to provide evidence of a chlorine attack, just go buy some pool chemicals and bam you have the chemical signature present.</p>

<p>the problem with chemical weapons from a use standpoint is it basically greenlights international intervention. no leader with a 1/4 of a brain would ever risk when some one like the US is foaming at the mouth for an excuse to invade and depose you.</p>

<p>tactically they are all but useless unless used broadly either. i mean they work great when you have a long dug in front, but they make almost no sense to use in an urban setting because they actually make it dangerous for your own troops to enter the are afterwards unless they decay quickly after they are deployed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard and argument that a lot of assads strategy was to depopulate rebel areas, because he didnt have enough troops to hold the ground otherwise. Chemical weapons in this scenario would be used to drive people out of an area, not necessarily kill them. </p>

<p>The 7th report of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism about the attacks on Umm Hawsh and Khan Shaykhun is pretty interesting: <a href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/N1734930.pdf">https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/N1734930.pdf</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, I have yet to read the linked report, but the quotes and your notes in the post were eye-popping:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Mechanism determined that sarin had been released from the location of a crater in the northern part of Khan Shaykhun between</em> <strong><em>0630 and 0700 hours</em></strong> <em>on 4 April 2017.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The time frame is important, keep that in mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it is. From further down:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Certain irregularities were observed in elements of the information analysed. For example,</em> <strong><em>several hospitals appeared to have begun admitting casualties of the attack between 0640 and 0645 hours.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>The admission times noted in the records range from 0600</em></strong> <em>to 1600 hours. Analysis of the records revealed that</em> <strong><em>in 57 cases, patients had been admitted to five hospitals before the incident (at 0600, 0620 and 0640 hours)</em></strong>. <em>In 10 of those cases, patients appear to have been</em> <strong><em>admitted to a hospital 125 km away from Khan Shaykhun at 0700 hours, while another 42 patients appear to have been admitted to a hospital 30 km away at 0700 hours.</em></strong> <em>The Mechanism did not investigate those discrepancies and cannot determine whether they are linked to any possible staging scenario or are the result of poor record-keeping in chaotic conditions.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t make this shit up. That whole section reeks of staged event.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[sarcasm on]</p>

<p>No, what it really exposes is the excellent quality of health care offered by the enemies of Assad. Their al Nusra medical teams are <em>so good</em> that they start treating the injured <em>before</em> the injuries are even inflicted, and their ambulances are <em>so fast</em> that they can move patients 125 km (77 miles) in under 30 minutes -- an average speed of 250 kph (154 mph) <strong><em>ZOOM!</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Americans and Europeans should be ashamed. Their health care systems pale in comparison to the speed and quality of the amazing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Shaykhun_chemical_attack"><strong>Nurses of al Nusra.</strong></a></p>

<p>[sarcasm off]</p>
