    <div class="md"><p>Trump is no Hitler. The institutions of the Republic- as far as allowing a dictator to rise- are still sound. The real danger rests in the attacks on the Office of the Presidency itself by a 4th estate out for blood and a power hungry Deep State seeking to reassert its dominance. I&#39;m not a Trump supporter but I am a supporter of the Office of the Presidency and this Russia BS is nothing but an attack on the institution itself.</p>

<p>If we allow Trump to be driven out of office on lies and innuendos, it will permanently damage the Office itself and could be used against someone who I do actually support- and as such it must be fought against. </p>

<p>All that said- those who ignore the past are doomed to repeat it. This is why the study of history, and especially of Western Civilization itself, is utterly important. This is also why the concept of the West has been so heavily demonized and why schools and Universities no longer teach Western Civ as a mandatory or cohesive unit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump was elected in a Constitutionally sound election- and is constrained by both the Legislature and the Courts. He has made no Hitleresque moves to destroy the balance of power among the branches of government. The similarities are surface at best. This country has always been Nationalistic, it&#39;s part of the American ethos. </p>

<p>Quit buying into the hype thinking Trump is the next Hitler. Do you honestly think he wont hold elections in 2020? Do you think the Army would support him, or the common people, if he did such a thing? Do you forget there are more guns than people in this country? Calm down- there will be no coup on Trumps part. At worst he remains President until 2024 and is then peacefully transitioned out of power as has been done since 1796. </p>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t going to gas anyone. He&#39;s not going to become dictator. Calm the fuck down- you are buying into everything they want you to buy into and being a perfect little drone for TPTB. Instead of focusing on the real issues, you pretend Trump is <em>actually Hitler</em>. What a fucking joke.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You really do believe Trump is going to become Hitler...LOL. You keep on pretending that&#39;s the bigger issue and not the destruction of the Office of the Presidency by outside forces, the looming economic crises, the hollowed out middle class, and the overall fractious state of the Republic.</p>

<p>Yet you heavily implied it. You comparing Trump and Hitler automatically invokes images of the gas chambers and genocide...which is <em>exactly</em> what you intended to do. Not my fault you realize how goofy you sounded and need to backpedal, lol.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your point is to compare Hitler and Trump in order to invoke the imagery of Hitler and bind that thought to Trump. It was a pathetic attempt and the proof of this is your backpedalling, which you are doing now.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Considering I&#39;m not a Trump supporter, that&#39;s pretty damn funny. You&#39;re going to back off so that you stop looking like an idiot, and that&#39;s the Truth. See ya around bud! </p>

<p>Hitler said that the threat to Germany was the Jews.
Trump said the threat to America was the Mexicans. He wants to build a wall.</p>

<p>Hitler said the Germans were unique and superior. That they had been held down  from achieving their rightful place by global treaties.
Trump said America was exactly the same.</p>

<p>Hitler blamed the Jews for wrecking their economy.
Trump blames the Mexicans for the same.</p>

<p>Hitler decried various parties in Germany saying it made them weak.
Trump has blamed opposition parties for all that ails America.</p>

<p>I could go on but you won’t hear me. The truth is having a simplistic nationalist in power generally ends up achieving the same things.</p>

<p>I’ll throw you a softball... what type of person would you put in power? Why?
No one says let’s elect a dictator in a democracy. People DO turn toward people like Hitler and Trump when they have had enough.</p>

<p>But rejecting the status quo doesn’t make that candidate the same. Even though the may be quite similar.  Trump is the populist response to folks feeling sidelined. Hitler was too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you do want to keep going! Fun!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler said that the threat to Germany was the Jews. Trump said the threat to America was the Mexicans. He wants to build a wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hitler blamed the Jews for losing WW1 and claimed that they were racially inferior, conniving backstabbers who needed to be dealt with. Trump simply says Mexicans are taking American jobs- while I don&#39;t believe illegal immigrants are anywhere near the problem Trump says they are, he is nowhere near Hitler in his thoughts on Mexicans. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler said the Germans were unique and superior. That they had been held down from achieving their rightful place by global treaties. Trump said America was exactly the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hitler was right when talking about treaties- Versailles was an unfair peace that guaranteed another conflict would arise. And again- American nationalism is a part of the national ethos- we&#39;ve always been proud of our country, and every president has echoed these jingoistic sentiments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler blamed the Jews for wrecking their economy. Trump blames the Mexicans for the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hitler blamed the Jews for fare more- he claimed they intentionally lost Germany WW1, a far larger charge, you ought to brush up on your history young buck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler decried various parties in Germany saying it made them weak. Trump has blamed opposition parties for all that ails America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it the Mexicans or Opposition Parties? And by Parties you mean...Democrats? There are only 2 Parties, and each one always demonizes the other and blames them for all the problems in the country...nothing new at all bud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could go on but you won’t hear me. The truth is having a simplistic nationalist in power generally ends up achieving the same things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve heard you...and you are so utterly wrong its hilarious. You draw feeble surface comparisons between one of histories worst dictators and pretend Trump is anywhere close. You also ignore the inherent Nationalism in American culture- nothing near 1930&#39;s Germany and not close to the issue you pretend it is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ll throw you a softball... what type of person would you put in power? Why? No one says let’s elect a dictator in a democracy. People DO turn toward people like Hitler and Trump when they have had enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t Hitler. He won&#39;t seize power. He wont throw anyone in camps...it&#39;s very ignorant to claim he is like Hitler just because he has a veneer of Nationalism painted about himself. There is oh so much more needed. Trump is a symptom of the collapsing Republic- a desperate call to the night. He won&#39;t become a dictator though...people voted him in based on policies, which when they fail will expose him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But rejecting the status quo doesn’t make that candidate the same. Even though the may be quite similar. Trump is the populist response to folks feeling sidelined. Hitler was too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Trump is nothing like Hitler, though you pretend he is. Trump is constrained by the actual balance of power of the branches of the US government and by elections, which will be held in 2020 and again in 2024. Trump will never become another Hitler, you need to take a step back from this panicked worldview you inhabit. </p>

<p>Nice strawmen...but it shows how weak your arguments actually are. No- I don&#39;t believe germans were evil idiots, and I don&#39;t believe Americans were for supporting Iraq and Afghanistan- both were duped.

<p>What propaganda am I spewing?</p>

<p>What wasn&#39;t mentioned? The realities of one day are not necessarily the same as the last...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think that&#39;s propaganda...well, you should just go back to watching the approved MSM narrative of events and settle back down into the stew as it boils. I&#39;m not a Trump supporter, my comments and submissions attest to that, but I can see the BS being perpetrated against him and it&#39;s laughable. Unfortunate that you don&#39;t...though you gave me a good chuckle in calling me a peddler of propaganda! lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because you work in marketing doesn&#39;t mean you conform to my ideas of what that industry does...hence my benefit of the doubt. Still no need to downvote me...but since you think I&#39;m pushing propaganda I suppose that is inevitable. </p>
