    <div class="md"><p>What a weird lens to see things through. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the Olympics, so the media toned down the nuke and war talk for a couple weeks. Has nothing to do with spiting Trump or getting Americans to side with North Korea. With or without Trump, Americans know NK is an unstable state-size cult with nukes. How far up your own ass do you have to be to think this way?</p>

<p>How would praising NK make any more people dislike Trump? Why have they only dialled back the hostility now?</p>

<p>Liberal media shitting on Trump isn&#39;t some conspiracy, it&#39;s just them playing to their base. The same way Fox would shit on Obama (and still does occasionally), that&#39;s what their viewers want to hear.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s exactly what happens.....through the MSM. The MSM as a supposedly independent entity with integrity (I have to laugh everytime I hear that) they provide a platform from which the government lies to us. We get into illegal wars. MSM apologizes for not being more diligent. Rinse and repeat. And even their own polls show that over 70% of their viewers don&#39;t trust them. </p>

<p>But, try telling someone some news that hasn&#39;t been validated by the very MSM they don&#39;t trust and you&#39;re a god damned lunatic for spreading &quot;fake news&quot;. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even tune in to news on the TV anymore unless it&#39;s a active situation that&#39;s being covered live. I do read it. I also read a lot of other news sources on the matters that are important to me. But, I&#39;ll be damned if I believe much of it. </p>

<p>We worked with Communists against Fascists. Then we took the Fascists in for their science and technology, and all of the sudden the Communists were the enemies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s such a thin metaphor it amazes me it has to be explained. Then again, everyone says &quot;It&#39;s just like 1984!&quot; instead of realizing that he was talking about the state of the world ~70 years ago. It&#39;s that much worse than 1984.</p>

<p>1948/1984 is about showing how you can make 2+2=5, reversing facts of history, logical, and truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to relate something-I just happened to watch part of a movie this morning - Josie and the Pussycats. The ideas revealed there totally blew my mind. Let me explain. There is one woman villain in the movie that owns a huge media conglomerate. Her idea is to get teenagers hooked on rock music and play subliminal messages along with the music. Wow... But wait, it gets better. Before that, as I was flipping through the channels, there was a show, about women in the police, and how they do their policing. So, this black police woman stops a vehicle under the pretext that she witnessed the driver throw garbage out the window, and the guy (also black), says no, he was just adjusting the side mirror. So the female cop checks and you wouldn&#39;t guess, the dude has a warrant for not showing in court- for playing music too loud. And his girlfriend, who was riding shotgun, also had a warrant for some chickenshit charge, so she hauls them both to jail. Afterwards, she admits that the black man in fact was really adjusting his mirror and didn&#39;t throw out any trash out the car window. And she chuckles. And I am like, OMFG, they are not even trying to cover their propaganda with subliminal messages anymore, they want us to watch it and be very afraid. It was quite an epiphany. I am just curious, does anyone find a show like Cops entertaining? WTF watches that for fun?</p>

<p>Admitting he didn&#39;t throw any trash on camera not only meant the charges would be dropped, but she could be sued. Yes, this shit happens all the time, but they don&#39;t chuckle about it openly on tv after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I had recorded the show, this happened in Cincinnati OH. But that&#39;s immaterial. What is important is that it is propaganda. Personally, I don&#39;t know anyone that would enjoy such a show, it&#39;s not entertaining in the least. Judge Judy is one thing, where at least she talks some sense, but to present such a police reality show is deceptive without mentioning that these are actors.</p>

No one is pretending it&#39;s not a brutal dictatorship. They&#39;re just expressing hope that small positive steps like this could be a prelude to some kind of real change in the country or at least in their relations with the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The story isn&#39;t that NK is good now. It&#39;s that for once they made a small step away from the brink of war. I guess if you see the world in black and white, you can&#39;t receive a story like that without feeling like your narrative is being challenged.</p>

Hell, do we not desperately want the NK/SK conflict to finally resolve?  Is anyone happy that a nuclear armed country is run by a maniac with no checks and balances?</p>

<p>I think OP is suggesting this is anti-Trump; I dont think it is. 
 Trump was anti-NK a year ago and the media was demonizing them then.  This is just... for once we&#39;re talking peace.  The story is better, and they&#39;re reporting the story (holy shit who knew?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has a point though, it was all North Korea is bad and lately there hasn&#39;t been much bitch slapping. Just before the Olympics I saw some rhetoric hit the news about stuff Kim was saying, but then just flowers from our media now.</p>

<p>You seem too ready to down play the MSM, who never do anything without some agenda, as just something that happened and that&#39;s about it. Usually they are either feeding talking points, covering over something else, releasing false information (to later in edited with true information without republishing or announcing an error).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am conflicted.</p>

<p>On one hand.... WW2 Germany and Jews and all that.... it is happening right now in N.Korea.  These people they are idolizing are running the program.  N.Korea regularly chooses famine over military spending.</p>

<p>They have a 3 generation policy.  If you do something wrong 3 generations of your family are punished along side you.</p>

<p>On the other hand though.... N.Korea does not appear to be going away soon enough.  The entire world has been waiting for there government to be overthrown for decades now.  The N.K government is doing an excellent job of staying in power.</p>

<p>Short of military action - which carries with it a very heavy civilian price tag - I just don&#39;t see them going away.</p>

<p>One of the points of the Olympics has always been that you find a way for governments who are not getting along to have friendly sporting contests.  Get them into a room together and force them to say nice things about each other.</p>

<p>I have always thought this is a good idea.</p>

<p>I think the media using this as an opportunity to draw circles and arrows around Kim and label him a butcher would be counterproductive.</p>

<p>But I do find it creepy to idolize his family.  I think my preference would be to ignore him.</p>

<p>&#39;Oh look, there is Kim - now back to Mens Downhill!&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to agree with this.  Going further, the media is probably giving north korea soft, if not favorable coverage to ease tensions, particularly because the south koreans are terrified that the north is going to do something batshit insane during the olympics.  Everyone in the world wants to get through the next 18 days without a war.</p>

<p>But this isn&#39;t to say the media is not in bed with the government.  they are, and this could be some kind of state department initiative to spin NK positively, to keep everything copacetic.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s the Olympics. The media, especially recently (like last 30 years) has treated this as an event to put aside politics and come together as the world. Of course, to many in this sub, this change of tone during the Olympics is about something else, simply ignoring that this &quot;coincidentally&quot; happened during the Olympics.</p>

<p>Honestly, after reading the articles that a lot of this is referencing, all of what I have read (and I could have missed something) has talked about how this is <em>actually</em> just PR by North Korea (like how sending the sister was a counter to Ivanka).</p>

<p>However, what I have seen is a lot of the alt media misrepresenting what the main stream media is saying in order to make it look like they are praising NK, to step up their attacks against them.</p>

<p>I wish some of the members of this sub would give the same critical eye they put towards the MSM to the alt media as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had long conversations with a former principle about this topic. There were two main things I learned from my conversations with them. One was that the &quot;bad kids&quot; &quot;needed&quot; the attention more than the &quot;good kids.&quot; In fact, they related a story to me where one of their &quot;good students,&quot; speaking on behalf of the other &quot;good kids,&quot; complained to them that the &quot;bad kids&quot; were getting more attention, to which this person replied along the lines of, &quot;yes, but after you&#39;ve been labeled the bad kid, and have begun to internalize that label, you do need that sort of attention, whereas the good kids [like you, Suzy] have the privilege of not having to live with that label.&quot; </p>

<p>The other lesson I learned is that principals have basically [innocently] weaponized young women against men. This person told me that before they integrated women into the school, the boys were kind of a nightmare, but with young women around, everything changes, especially their behavior. Now, they&#39;re constantly conscious of the young women around. In other words, young women really don&#39;t need young men around to be well behaved (at that middle to high school age), but they are a godsend for boys&#39; schools, and could be considered sensibly necessary in helping to maintain order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see where this seems odd but I think there are a few things one must consider:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The demonizing has always been towards the leader and upper government, we have <em>never</em> had any reason to be against the <em>people</em> of North Korea; they are the victims.</p></li>
<li><p>It could be that it is well known Kim Jung Un is basically a petulant child and despite the ultra-high stakes game he is playing, he is more swayed by his image than anything else.  Maybe it is positive reinforcement.  He has been mocked and demonized in Western media all the time, and he has total control over the information inNorth Korea where he tries to make people thing the rest of the world is evil and wants to kill them.  Being nice now serves two purposes:  to show him when he comes to the table he gets <em>good</em> coverage and, two, to take the chance while his people are outside of his containment zone that the West <em>does not hate them or want to kill them</em>. (This is probably the most important part!)</p></li>
<li><p>The media loves to get points for praising anything that isn’t Western culture, it is a form of racism:  if they praise something overtly, it is a backhanded and condescending insult if you read between the lines... they <em>need</em> praise.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s simply that Trump told Pence to maintain a hard face and basically don’t give those bastards an inch because they neither deserve it or earned it. No the MSM have yet another reason to hate the president. “US reaction was cold in the face of unity and peace in Korea”. Gonna be the headline you see or might already be out there idk. It’s just that obvious </p>

I&#39;m sure they have their share of problems there, but I&#39;ve learned over the years not to trust boogeyman stories about other countries (especially when coming to me from sources like CNN, FOX, MSNBC, etc).

    <div class="md"><p>This is pretty easy.  The only real obstacle to a unified Korea is the leadership in North Korea.  The NK regime knows that every passing day means that there model of govt. is not sustainable.  Information gets in...people get out.  You cannot maintain this forever.  They also  know that what is best is to reunify and jump on the money train that is S Korea.  The Korean people also want reunification.  They have a shared history, and this isn&#39;t totally unlike Germany being split after WWII.  So, US Executive office is not super on board, as we saw with Pence not standing, or applauding or showing any respect...but, the media is rewarding behavior that we want to see repeated.  Efforts to bridge the gap lead to &quot;hey, great job.  We know you&#39;re still a vicious little dictator, but we like this.&quot;.  If he tests another nuke, the tone will reflect that, as well.</p>

Use the Olympic games to look like they&#39;re building ties with SK and promoting unification, when all they&#39;re doing is stopping and invasion from the west and east as no one is going to invade or attempt to stop a country that&#39;s &quot;extending the olive branch of peace&quot;. I&#39;m not really into conspiracies i just lurk here every now and again.

    <div class="md"><p>Ctrl+F: Diplomacy</p>

<p>Not a single result.</p>

<p>This is how diplomacy works: praise where necessary, scold where necessary.</p>

<p>By uniting under a single flag, watching events together, having delegations meeting etc this is how you bring about a warming of relations. </p>

<p>Praising them for doing the right thing, when they do the right thing, is EXACTLY what needs to happen: it can be conducive to improving relations.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t deny, negate, or diminish their previous scold-worthy actions. But it can help to reduce them in the future.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware while all this has been going on Kim Jong-un held a military parade, so they&#39;re not quite ready to drop the belligerence just yet and reunite Korea. However, marginal gains in diplomacy are to be celebrated, because they can add up to larger ones.</p>

NK is a CIA black op/black pawn and has been for 60+ years. War is a banker scam utilizing dark CIA forces/ops to creat wars/enemies using the Main Stream Media to advertise the war and bolster public support (we pay for the wars / bankers profit from wars)
Trump/Q/seal team? took out 2 Cia black ops communication centers in Asia that were controlling NK/CIA handlers... Trump/Un send VP/Sister to keep FF false flag nuke event at Olympics from ever happening...

<p>If this is really the first step into a reconciliation with NK, or better yet, unification with the South, then the MSM needs to undo most of the demonising it’s done over the past few years so that the transition to the world stage is as smooth as possible.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there’s an argument to be made that seeming open to NK and praising their decision to work with the South to represent Korea as a whole in the games, might make the NK administration more open to idea, simply because you’re more likely to join a group that you think might tolerate you.</p>

<p>Finally, if NK returns to normalcy after the Olympics, it’s not skin off the media outlet’s noses. They can play it up like the media being fooled by NK’s facade and the general population will slip right back into the previous narrative over NK, depending on which outlet they consume the most.</p>

<p>It’s nothing sinister.</p>

<p>When Trump v. Kim flares up again (as it undoubtedly will), the MSM wants to be in the position to pick a side, depending on the circumstances. They will either be able to demonize both Trump and Kim, or just Trump, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>If Kim commits overt acts of aggression, the MSM can demonize both. If Kim performs acts passive aggression (e.g. stonewalling the UN, military drills in contested seas, etc.), the MSM can attack whatever response Trump makes.</p>

With his massive ego I am sure he would much rather the West be fawning all over him and it will probably piss him off that his sister has gotten so much attention. Maybe he will see it as a potential threat to his rule. </p>

<p>We know MSM works close with the intelligence community so I can see this being a distinct possibility. </p>

<p>Otherwise it really doesn&#39;t make any sense.  I live in Cincinnati where Otto was taken when he came home and I have heard horror stories about how he was treated from people that worked close to him. No American media outlet should be praising a country that tortured and murdered one of our own. </p>

<p>Up until Trump got elected, NK was a buffoonish dictatorship that can&#39;t even get a rocket to crash in the ocean properly. Trump gets elected, all of a sudden they&#39;re a nuclear power that can hit 3/4s of the planet with nuclear warheads.</p>

<p>NK is a complete black hole of information and the two Koreas absolute mortal to the end.... but they&#39;ll share an Olympic team. Really?</p>

<p>Every photo or video of Kim and his generals looks like it was thrown together by a high school theater group. The uniforms look ridiculous, the backgrounds, the rooms, the buildings, all look like a ridiculous high school theater level construction.</p>

<p>The press releases and the announcements from NK look ridiculous. The video from their supposed govt TV looks like kindergarten level bullshit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what &#39;s going on in NK, but that buffoon and his father and grandfather are just actors in a bad soap opera. They are the false face of something entirely different than what they are claimed to be.</p>

<p>The other alternative, which you seem to favor, is the continuation of belittling NK, thus making them get pissed off enough to start a nuclear war. And this time around it won&#39;t be like Ww2, almost everyone has recognized that since there are so many nukes, one going off will initiate a cascade of nukes from all around the world, that it will be the end of humanity. </p>

<p>So yeah, accepting them now and changing them through integration is really the only thing they everyone should be doing.</p>
