<p>In concert, they said, &quot;what&#39;s a what?&quot;  Not 1 of the 10 had ever heard of such a thing.  </p>

<p>Just goes to show ya...these anti-choice vaccine proponents are anything but scientists...they&#39;re bootlickers.  Worshipers of authority.  Nothing more.  They&#39;re the opposite of scientists.  They&#39;re brainless drones who justify their ignorance with statements like, &quot;You don&#39;t need to know what an adjuvant is to have an opinion about the worthiness and value of vaccines.&quot;  Indeed, mighty bootlicker, indeed.</p>

<p>Edit: Notice the strong downvote brigading on this post...lol.  They don&#39;t like it when their anti-science reality is exposed.  No comments, no rebuttals...just downvotes by the dozen. </p>

<p>Edit 2:  What is the affect of aluminum in the brain?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aluminum nanoparticles that are there to help stimulate the immune response to the pathogen being injected, allegedly to help build immunity. </p>

<p>The problem is these aluminum particles are taken up by macrophages, which are unable to digest them, so they then carry them throughout the body and eventually pass the blood brain barrier, contaminating the brain with aluminum, which causes inflammation. The inflammation attracts more macrophages, also contaminated with aluminum, leading to a vicious cycle of inflammation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. And because they say vaccines are inherently safe, they do very few long term toxicity studies. </p>

<p>&quot; Experimental evidence also shows that simultaneous administration of as little as two to three immune adjuvants can overcome genetic resistance to autoimmunity. In some developed countries, by the time children are 4 to 6 years old, they will have received a total of 126 antigenic compounds along with high amounts of aluminum (Al) adjuvants through routine vaccinations. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, safety assessments for vaccines have often not included appropriate toxicity studies because vaccines have not been viewed as inherently toxic.&quot;</p>

<p>My point is people want to feel smarter than others around them... at any cost. </p>

<p>A similar attitude is towards smoking. Since they have banned it in most public places people feel they can shit on smokers now. Loudly. </p>

<p>That&#39;s hard to disagree with. Unfortunately, most people don&#39;t argue from a sound and logical position. There&#39;s plenty of science that supports the idea that vaccinces are safe. And most of the time any science that doesn&#39;t fit the anti-vax thing is dismissed or ignored. </p>

Vaccines: What Your Doctors Know and Don’t Know
JENNIFER HUTCHINSON RECENT ARTICLES TOP STORIES
By  Jennifer Hutchinson /   July 31, 2012</p>

<p>What did your doctor learn about vaccines in medical school?</p>

<p>Do you ever wonder what doctors know about the dozens of vaccines they inject into your children? What they learn in medical school about vaccines? And after they graduate? Who controls what they are taught? My research has been quite an eye-opener.</p>

<p>WHAT DOCTORS LEARN IN SCHOOL …
First question: What do doctors actually learn in medical school about vaccines? Here’s what several have to say.</p>

<p>Dr. Suzanne Humphries:</p>

<p>“We learn that vaccines need to be given on schedule. We are indoctrinated with the mantra that ‘vaccines are safe and effective’—neither of which is true. Doctors today are given extensive training on how to talk to ‘hesitant’ parents—how to frighten them by vastly inflating the risks during natural infection. …on the necessity of twisting parents’ arms to conform, or fire them from their practices. Doctors are trained that NOTHING bad should be said about any vaccine, period.” [1]</p>

<p>Dr. Bob Sears:</p>

<p>“Doctors learn a lot about diseases in medical school, but we learn very little about vaccines. … We don’t review the research ourselves. We never learn what goes into making vaccines or how their safety is studied. So, when patients want a little more information about shots, all we can really say as doctors is that the diseases are bad and the shots are good.” [2]</p>

<p>Dr. Larry Palevsky:</p>

<p>“I was taught that vaccines were completely safe and completely effective. But I kept seeing that my experience … in using and reading about vaccines, and hearing what parents were saying about vaccines were very different from what I was taught … When I look at the studies that the AAP and the CDC put out, saying that there’s no correlation between vaccination and autism or vaccinations and asthma, I have to say that the studies just don’t hold up to the scientific standards.” [3]</p>

<p>I was told the first night what could have happened if they hadn&#39;t caught it when they did and reading up on it was nothing short of terrifying. Fatigue and pain levels were extremely high for the first 6 months; when I finally got back to work I had to switch from floor to cashier so I could sit down. Needless to say I appreciate to my core just how lucky I was.</p>

<p>Not sick, at all. </p>

<p>The issue is not with adjuvants when in regards to the flu vaccine, the issue is with the virology of influenza and its mutagenicity. </p>

<p>When you give someone a flu vaccine for a strain that is dominant that year, it could lead to higher mutagenicity, especially if the strain within the vaccine is of a lower respiratory influenza, and you also get attacked by a secondary lower respiratory influenza infection from another strain, this will lead to high mutagenicity, especially considering you have introduced dead components of another influenza, that although may be dead by itself, some of the proteinous structures and components could still be salvagable by the secondary attacking influenza leading to much worse complications, pneumonia, etc.</p>

<p>This is becoming a consistent trend, I don&#39;t even need to talk about the adjuvants, I am all about the science.</p>

<p>Next you will tell me filamentous borrelial dermatitis is real, I remember when I was trying to educate people about that, the guy who knows absolutely nothing trying to tell me what?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want you to listen to me, if you consider accurate, thorough science to be a negative thing as indicated within your comment, I feel bad for you, I honestly do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is your choice, as a parent, to decide what you think is best. Sadly this day and age doctors are lazy, they want to get people in and out so they can get through as many people as possible. </p>

<p>These leads to laziness, like giving the MMR shot all at once instead of properly spacing it out, that doctor thinks: &quot;one and done, don&#39;t come back&quot; then if you come back they are at a loss for words because they actually just fucked up, could lose medical licensing, etc, and I am sure at this point legislation has been introduced to protect medical licensing when this type of shit happens with vaccines specifically. </p>

<p>The problem is the lack of knowledge people are given in this day and age. </p>

<p>I have provided the full MMR vaccine ingredient list here with all its side effects, etc etc.</p>

<p>There is a lot of issues with it, and your right about overall mortality, as there is nothing me and you can go off of that states a difference either positively or negatively of overall mortality in regards to vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. </p>

<p>With mumps and measles making a comeback within the last decade or 2, I think vaccinating for these separately is still a good idea and protects children overall. </p>

<p>The biggest thing is, they are trying to reduce deaths, and reduce instances of encephalitis and pneumonia that lead to long term health issues if they infant even survives. </p>

<p>I believe there would show a better overall mortality within vaccinated populations, I don&#39;t think it would be massively extraordinary, but I believe it would be a higher by a measurable amount, the only thing is, this specific paragraph is all speculation, as there is nothing in regards to overall mortality in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.</p>

<p>In regards to your last question, just remember this, your child may still develop measles and mumps after receiving the vaccines, but I can tell you 100% that the symptoms, and the further complications, are much lower in the vaccinated children than unvaccinated. If you know (they go to school, its going to happen) they are going to come into contact with this viruses/bacteria, then the best course of action is to take preventative measures, IF you believe when or if your child comes into contact with them, they will develop a severe reaction. </p>

<p>I believe they should simply be spaced out appropriately, the problem is with laziness and time consumption in regards to doctors, they see it as taking too long, they want the lazy way out, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except for YOU CANT vaccinate for them separately. I did tons of research while pregnant with my son and found out that the vaccine companies stopped making MMR separately because people would not follow through on getting them all and the drug companies decided to stop making them independently around 2013. I&#39;m sure the fact that they can charge for having all 3 vaccines in one helps their bottom line along with making sure people are getting fully vaccinated. My son who is now 2, is vaccinated but we spaced them out every 3 months instead of all at once. It&#39;s hard to know what the right thing to do is as a parent these days....</p>

<p>“In the United States, measles is generally a benign, short-term viral infection; 99.99% of measles cases fully recover,” said Dr. Miller. “As it has NOT been proven that the MMR vaccine is safer than measles, there is INSUFFICIENT evidence to demonstrate that mandatory measles mass vaccination results in a net public health benefit in the United States.”</p>

<p>“There is a five-fold higher risk of seizures from the MMR vaccine than seizures from measles, and a significant portion of MMR-vaccine seizures cause permanent harm.”</p>

That said, he&#39;s pretty science illiterate which is why he stopped posting on Twitter, real scientists were telling him he was wrong about shit.

She spent a large amount of time at a children&#39;s home, because my great-grandmother had 8 other children to care for and they were poor farmers. Even though my family was quite poor, my aunt received treatment for polio and she successfully went to college, had a child (my cousin who is now in her 40s and healthy), and lived to 65. She passed away a few years ago after living a full life. She passed away from complications due to pneumonia - nothing polio-related, btw. Yes she was tiny (4&#39;9) and had a hunchback but polio did nothing to stop her living her life to the fullest... she was the most jovial and funniest person I have still ever met to this day. </p>

I&#39;m a charlatan because I extensively studied biochemistry, physics, and math? Do you have any idea how to calculate mathematical models of molecular systems using partial differential equations or affine and projective geometry? Any extensive study in thermodynamics, techniques in theoretical physics, quantum mechanics? What about organic chemistry, cellular biology, clinical microbiology, structure and function of biomacromolecules? Just a random sampling of my courses I completed and continue to tutor for money. Yea what a waste of time. Especially all the real world experience I have applying that knowledge working in my research lab working on microtubule biophysics. That M.S. I&#39;m working on and eventual Ph.D. is gonna look really dumb compared to a plumber. I bet you could easily explain to me why all the well proven and predictive things I have learned and use in the real world are actually wrong.</p>

<p>i once worked for a very smart man, who went to one of the best universities for his field of study</p>

<p>one day i admitted to him that i didn&#39;t quite understand something (actually what i had just learned completely turned my previous understanding upside down)</p>

<p>so he politely explained what was going on, and then i understood a little better</p>

<p>then he proceeds to tell me that he only learned 5% of what he needed to know to do his job at the university, and the rest he had to learn on the job</p>

<p>then he goes on to say that he was so desperate for a job when he applied for this one, that he would have accepted anything, even a janitor job sweeping floors</p>

<p>i guess at some level he knew he was in a saturated field where people like him become disposable  </p>

<p>suffice it to say, everything you think you know about electricity is wrong </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a high demand for people with graduate degrees in Biochemistry/Molecular Biology/Biophysics.  Definitely not a saturated field.  I&#39;ve already worked several paid positions at prestigious research institutions (WHOI and MBL to name a couple) so that will definitely give me a leg up in the job market once I finish grad school.  Dunno what you learned about electricity that makes you think I don&#39;t know what it is/how it works.  I can tell you definitively, though I&#39;m not an electrical engineer, I have taken courses on Electricity and Magnetism and performed experiments to test the foundations of our understanding of the phenomena.  They all performed as expected. As for what I&#39;ve learned/am learning in school, it definitely informs everything I do in my current position in my research lab.  I certainly learn more specific or complicated applications of general principals when working in the lab but without the foundation knowledge from classes on the subject I would be absolutely lost.  For instance, when I have to clone and purify a specific protein with a specific tag that I want to use in an assay, I might be able to simply follow the protocol like a recipe, but I would have no idea about the underlying mechanisms by which the protocol worked.  I would have no idea what to try and fix if something went wrong.  I would have no idea how to interpret certain errors or how to modify the protocol under different conditions.  These are all things that other&#39;s who work in the lab will not help you with because they have time consuming work, they are struggling to get their assays to work correctly, and that is stuff that I should already know before even stepping foot in the lab.  What was your boss&#39;s field?  What degrees did he get? Also, can you tell me what the real deal with electricity is?  I&#39;m very curious now.</p>

<p>Because &quot;You cannot reason someone out of something he or she was not reasoned into.&quot;</p>

<p>generally speaking, you should avoid needles and germs, unless its called a vaccine. then you should get as much as you can</p>

<p>Where is this stated? Because this whole comment chain is about the usefulness of a degree to determine likelihood of causes. Here&#39;s where it started:</p>

<p>uhh hate to tell you this but your first link is about, &quot;The objective of this study was to estimate the numbers of CRS and ASD cases <strong>prevented</strong> by rubella vaccination in the United States from 2001 through 2010.&quot; And they state in the results, &quot;we estimate that a minimum of 830 ASD cases and a maximum of 6225 ASD cases were prevented.&quot;</p>

<p>And your second study actually lists what symptoms they tested for <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/198/1/16/841083">https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/198/1/16/841083</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the vaccinia virus–
naive subjects who were enrolled in the study developed pock formation at the vaccination site, and a subset experienced systemic reactions that included fever, rash, or regional lymphadenopathy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They determine that there is a link between three (though the third SNP has statistical support than the other two) SNPs and the listed AEs. This determination along with the functions of both SNPs is listed in their discussion but makes no determination of the extremity of symptoms due to the vaccination. In summary, this study is a long way from supporting your basis that vaccines cause autism (because it only suggests that certain symptoms correlate with the existence of certain variations of certain genes), and directly opposes your stance on academia&#39;s ability to determine liability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>keep bragging about that education. all it means is that you licked boots longer than the next kid</p>

<p>If that&#39;s what you think it all means, no wonder you can&#39;t even read your own studies let alone find any that support your position with any degree of finality.</p>

<p>So some lesson from fourth grade was wrong so all of academia is useless? This usage as &quot;evidence&quot; is what I mean by lacking in a logical argument. The article does nothing to determine the prevalence of the lesson in education, nor does a specific historical inaccuracy have anything to do with biological, medical, or statistical analysis. In fact it actually opposes your position by laying the blame of the inaccuracy at the feet of two specific authors who were incorrect (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield</a>). </p>

<p>You really need to understand that anecdotal evidence is NOT empirical evidence. You&#39;re actually arguing entirely opposite to this point. You are ignoring the empirical evidence stating that vaccinations are safe and effective.</p>

<p>Actually its thanks to education that I can understand it, because I was taught to look at sources and competing theories on it. The field of sociology is quite explicit on how one should go about understanding cultural pieces. You might want to read <em>Body Ritual Among the Nacirema</em> on its expansion of the idea of anthropological examinations.</p>

<p>Lets list how wrong this person is: </p>

<p>(First things he claims weren&#39;t taught) Vocational training, internships, and other job training classes are offered in high school and up. Same with financial literacy. Social studies and poli sci classes do cover the voting process and many states do try to make voting as easy as possible (though interference with this is also a common enough). Gym and health classes are a national requirement from elementary school. Once again social studies and other current event classes are commonly available in high school at the latest (also covers legal statutes). Secondary languages are mandatory in most states.</p>

<p>(Now how things that were taught aren&#39;t useful) Dissection is a part of biological courses due to its reinforcement of multiple systems with specific purposes interacting to forma more complex mechanism. Shakespeare classics are taught due to its importance in western culture and empathetic characters (e.g. they explicit motivations with the use of monologues and the use of the comedy/tragedy/history theme). Isotopic and biological basis are important in combating the ignorant theories like demons in the body. Historical literacy helps the understanding of cause and effect, he specifically mentions Henry VIII and his marriages as political importance. Optics is not commonly expanded due to its niche importance, but once again as a part of a larger scientific curriculum to understanding how the world work and the ability to determine phenomena from those basic rules. He mentions cursive just before an affidavit despite cursive&#39;s commonality at the time being an official usage. Mathematics is similar to the scientific curriculum with only one of its parts being the ability to understand how one can extrapolate answers from incomplete data. I assume he&#39;s talking about the hippocratic theory and is again part of teaching the populace about the larger understandable basis of cause and effect with observable factors. Which ironically he directly mentions its importance in the next line about effective vs ineffective medicine which the theory and its iterative usage learns from. Basic arithmetic is a useful skill, the prevalence of smartphones is irrelevant due to the people that don&#39;t have access to those devices are likely to need the skill anyways.</p>

<p>You want to learn these things? Here we go:</p>

<p><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/">https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/</a></p>

<p>Which has multiple classes devoted to understanding both political factors, legal aspects, language, philosophical, logic, and medical (including psychological or sociological) aspects.</p>

<p><strong>You literally linked to something that academia was structured about. That is a more extensive focused education on certain issues directly important to one&#39;s own life. You can go to your local community college and enroll in classes of just about anything you want to know let alone both paid or free online courses through other universities or places like khan academy.</strong></p>

<p>What do you think, people back around 1800 thought, when they created the first vaccine? &quot;Let&#39;s lull people into autism. I have just this bullshit &#39;smallpox vaccine&#39; to do it.

    <div class="md"><p>As you can see it’s a matter of risk factors and personal vulnerabilities. Vaccines need to be more custom in their application. Not everyone is at the same risk for the same diseases. Not everyone will react as badly to a vaccine as another person. Not all vaccines are associated with the the same level of severe effects as another. The cookie cutter formula we have is a huge disservice to everyone. It’s lazy. They are not as safe or as effective as advertised. That’s the point: informed consent, not necessary doing away with vaccines. You should realize having safe and effective vaccines is to your benefit and your child’s benefit.  Why would there be any objection to an independent safety commission?  If all is safe, then there is nothing to worry about, and you can shut the antivaxxers up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines are about giving you a neutered version of the virus, while still making sure it shares features with the deadly, functional strains of the virus. This allows you body learn how to recognize the deadly, functional version ASAP to prevent it from progressing to the point of symptoms, or even being contagious. This works well for some viruses, like polio, because the virus doesn&#39;t change shape often enough to work around a vaccinated population. Other viruses, like the flu or hiv, change their structure rapidly enough that it&#39;s impossible to vaccinate against (for now). These viruses also have a lot of hosts so they have even more opportunity to evolve around vaccinated people.</p>

The problem is a weak diet to due to ignorance of proper eating and lifestyle habits. </p>

<p>Eliminate the Vaccine Court and make Big Pharma libel for their vaccines. The Vaccine Court (US Taxpayers) has paid out over $3.5 Billion dollars in damages for Vaccine related injuries.</p>

<p>No mandatory vaccinations because it supersedes our rights to informed consent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Merck was trying to get Gardasil approved, the company went so far as to design several experiments using an aluminum adjuvant injection as the EXPERIMENTAL CONTROL for adverse reactions!</p>

<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012805/full">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012805/full</a></p>

<p>More than 10 years has passed since the systematic review by Jefferson and colleagues, new adjuvants are being introduced continuously, and FDA and WHO do not require genotoxicity or cardiotoxicity studies of new aluminium adjuvants (WHO 2014a; FDA 2015). Lately, symptoms following HPV vaccination have been suspected of being caused by the addition of aluminium adjuvant (Tomljenovic 2011; Lee 2012; Poddighe 2014; Brinth 2015a; Gruber 2015; Martinez-Lavin 2015). A recent animal study by Inbar and colleagues managed to spark further controversy by demonstrating behavioral abnormalities in mice administered the aluminium-containing HPV vaccine Gardasil (Inbar 2016a). Compared to previous animal studies on HPV vaccines, the authors included two control groups: one where mice were administered aluminium adjuvant alone and another with placebo without adjuvant (Inbar 2016a). Inbar and colleagues concluded that Gardasil via both its aluminium adjuvant and HPV antigens can trigger neuro-inflammation and autoimmune reactions, leading to behavioural changes in mice (Inbar 2016a). Upon submission to a peer-reviewed journal, the paper was accepted with revisions, and published. However, it was soon withdrawn by the editor (Inbar 2016), only to be published in a competing journal shortly thereafter (Inbar 2016a). The initial withdrawal was allegedly due to &quot;unsound scientific results&quot;; an assertion which was not supported by the final publisher. </p>

<p>The theory that aluminium adjuvant is responsible for symptoms following HPV vaccination is impossible to refute or prove based on the current data. Aluminium adjuvant has been administered to both experimental and control group in the vast majority of randomised clinical trials on HPV vaccines, thus masking its potentially harmful effects (Exley 2011). Clinical trials designed to administer vaccine adjuvants to the experimental group as well as the placebo group do, de facto, not compare an intervention against a true placebo, and therefore, do not adequately assess safety (Exley 2011). Indeed, aluminium adjuvants, new or old, should be evaluated for benefits and harms on their own merits.</p>

I think the truth is there is risk, but the risk of the virus itself usually outweighs this risk of the vaccine itself, or so they decide.  If you think about it a little it makes sense that there would be incentive to hide or play down the risks of vaccines by professionals because they know if they indicate there is any kind of risk then many people may start not getting vaccines and ultimately lead to massive outbreak of potentially deadly virus.  It makes it a decision of concealing risk vs. potential deadly outbreak, sort of like the moral dilemma with the split in the train tracks with 1 person on one side and a group of people on the other side where they have to pick whether the group or the person gets hit by the unstoppable train.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s very presumptuous, not to mention arrogant, to assume ppl are too stupid.  If they are, fix the educational system, stop injecting aluminum so they have learning disabilities, and don’t accept gov has right to trample over ppl’s rights when the constitution forbids it.  You are not understanding the betrayal of a profession sworn to ‘first do no harm.’  Doctor is accountable to deliver the best care to <em>his patient,</em> not society as a whole, not the cdc, and not gov. This goes for nurses as well, their professional priority is to protect patient’s interest and safety. They are being neutralized from doing so by many unethical influences. It is not a good time for healthcare in America. </p>

But what I don’t see is your objection to fact these ppl give themselves illegal and unethical powers over citizens’ rights.  Most ppl still believe their docs, cdc, gov is acting for their best interest and can’t conceive they are blatantly being deceived about what the risks of vaccines really are, the lack of scientific safety basis for recommendations, and general sloppiness in research and quality control. Inexcusable and unforgivable.  Did not mean to bash on you personally.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, that’s a simplistic defection. I thought you could talk on more scientific terms. Vaccines alone have not delivered us from disease. If you think you can say that based on scientific studies, you’d be wrong.  The outbreaks you see of mumps lately are due to vaccine <em>failure</em>, not unvaccinated kids. Shoot’em up with more brain-frying vaccines!  That’s your cdc answer. </p>

<p>Choice:  have a viral illness with remote chance of serious complications? 
OR
Get a  vaccine that may or <em>may not</em> work,
that will only work for a few years,
that will impede your immune system from acquiring natural, long lasting immunity,
that will cause you to shed the virus, infecting ppl around you, 
that contains debris and heavy metals due to poor production quality controls, 
that will increase your risk of chronic illness, mental illness and learning disabilities, and even death,
that contains known dangerous neurotoxic ingredients that will persist in your body, even your brain,
that your gov, doctor, fda and cdc collude to keep you uninformed about. </p>

Alum is avidly uptaken when injected and results in accumulation in brain </p>

<p>“Safety concerns largely depend on the long biopersistence time inherent to this adjuvant, which may be related to its quick withdrawal from the interstitial fluid by avid cellular uptake; and the capacity of adjuvant particles to migrate and slowly accumulate in lymphoid organs and the brain, a phenomenon documented in animal models and resulting from MCP1/CCL2-dependant translocation of adjuvant-loaded monocyte-lineage cells (Trojan horse phenomenon). These novel insights strongly suggest that serious re-evaluation of long-term aluminum adjuvant phamacokinetics and safety should be carried out.”</p>

A quick search (seriously no digging) says they boost your immune response while providing no immunity themselves. I&#39;m also seeing that some types can keep antigens around longer to help vaccines. Others just cause a stronger immune response directly.</p>

<p>I not sure why lack of knowledge about adjuvants make your pro vaccine coworkers &quot;bootlickers&quot;. The ones that keep the antigen around longer only really seem helpful for vaccines as this is in no way helpful for a live virus. The ones boost your immune response directly could have use, but they only would have killed you faster if you had the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic">spanish flu.</a> The spanish flu was deadly because it caused a person&#39;s immune system to kill them.

</blockquote>

<p>Just like all anti-vaxxers are big brains with advanced medical and scientific knowldege. /s Perhaps it&#39;s a surprise, but there are plenty of people who support vaccinations that have done their own research and came to a conclusion different from yours. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about research... </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html">CDC: Vaccines don&#39;t cause autism</a></li>
<li>[CDC: Vaccine Adjuvants (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/safetyavailability/vaccinesafety/ucm187810.htm">FDA: Common Ingredients in U.S. Licensed Vaccines</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Lucija Tomljenovic and Christopher Shaw&#39;s studies have plenty of detractors. Which makes their conclusions are, at the very least, controversial.  And the paper OP refers to &quot;Aluminum in brain tissue&quot; uses a Tomljenovic and Shaw paper as a reference:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paediatric vaccines that include an aluminium adjuvant are an indirect measure of infant exposure to aluminium and their burgeoning use has been directly correlated with increasing prevalence of ASD [11].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not proven. Here&#39;s a piece refuting the conclusions in the study OP refers to:</p>

<p><a href="http://justthevax.blogspot.com/2017/11/christopher-exley-has-become-new-face.html">Exley</a></p>

<p>I find it pretty galling that OP, who didn&#39;t present much in the way of science (and didn&#39;t present ANY science when they first wrote the post) calling others anti-science. </p>

<p>People need to decide for themselves which science is better. But they also need to make sure they look at lots of sources not just ones that might fit what they already think. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m curious though... When you heroically called out all those people at the office, did you present them with your degree in immunology or virology? Or did you just hit them with some antivaxxx buzzword that you found online?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s funny. Now that you guys have finally let go of the mercury argument (or rather, it was destroyed), you are grasping onto aluminum.</p>

<p>You were right to bring up the Galileo comparison. You&#39;re just not Galileo. Like his detractors, you don&#39;t understand the science, and you are afraid of what you don&#39;t understand, so you vilify and demonize it. </p>

Flu vaccine studies reviewed and found it provided—
“... modest time off work and had no effect on hospital admissions or complication rates. Inactivated vaccines caused local harms and an estimated 1.6 additional cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome per million vaccinations. The harms evidence base is limited.”</p>

<p>Weird that the people most educated on the subject support vaccinations, and people who don&#39;t (conspiracy tards) don&#39;t 🤔</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aluminum could do whatever to the brain, doesn’t matter. If you know <em>anything</em>, and I mean <em>anything</em>, about basic chemistry, you know that chemicals behave differently when combined with other chemicals</p>

<p>Like table salt. Table salt is 50 percent sodium, and 50 percent chloride. Chloride is incredibly deadly even in very small amounts, and sodium is so volatile that it can <em>explode</em> if you even spill it. But you put sodium and chloride together? They make ordinary, harmless table salt.</p>

<p>So no, all those “crazy chemicals” you hear about in vaccines (most of which are unfounded) don’t mean ANYTHING. Educate yourself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. And because they say vaccines are inherently safe, they do very few long term toxicity studies. </p>

<p>&quot; Experimental evidence also shows that simultaneous administration of as little as two to three immune adjuvants can overcome genetic resistance to autoimmunity. In some developed countries, by the time children are 4 to 6 years old, they will have received a total of 126 antigenic compounds along with high amounts of aluminum (Al) adjuvants through routine vaccinations. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, safety assessments for vaccines have often not included appropriate toxicity studies because vaccines have not been viewed as inherently toxic.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s an engineer. He&#39;s a scientist in the same way a medical doctor is.  He doesn&#39;t do science, but he&#39;s learned some of the discoveries brought about by people who do science to be able to apply it to real world systems. That said, he&#39;s pretty science illiterate which is why he stopped posting on Twitter, real scientists were telling him he was wrong about shit. I wish different fields had different science spokespeople instead of Niel Degrass Tyson trying to educate people on GMO&#39;s because &quot;well he&#39;s a scientist&quot;. Can we get a famous Biochemist on TV?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude the polio virus is for the most part dormant in those who carry it, even those not vaccinated against it. It has NOTHING to do with the vaccine. Weak bodies become affected, not infected bodies. This whole vaccine theory is a big story they indoctrinated us into during school. Natural herbs and detox methods are much more effective (and thus less profitable) if done in a preventative way according to the time, place, and circumstance.</p>

(Hint: it&#39;s usually jeans and a shirt, like what I wear anyway) I&#39;m also still in grad school but hey at least I get paid to teach undergrad courses. BTW I think your math is off. Average master plumber makes $48,000/yr and the top %10 make $79,000/yr.

But what I don’t see is your objection to fact these ppl give themselves illegal and unethical powers over citizens’ rights.  Most ppl still believe their docs, cdc, gov is acting for their best interest and can’t conceive they are blatantly being deceived about what the risks of vaccines really are, the lack of scientific safety basis for recommendations, and general sloppiness in research and quality control. Inexcusable and unforgivable.  Did not mean to bash on you personally.  </p>
