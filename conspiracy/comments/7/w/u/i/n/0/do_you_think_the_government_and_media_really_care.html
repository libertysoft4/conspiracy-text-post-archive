        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have seen a lot of laziness from the government and media to inform us about certain chemicals that affect us, including how they affect immune response. With all of their <em>apparent</em> concern over babies&#39; and childrens&#39; immune systems, you would expect them to be yelling this from the rooftops and doing everything they can to both inform us and protect us. However, to give credit where credit is due, The Intercept has a really good 16 part series on these chemicals called The Teflon Toxin.</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/series/the-teflon-toxin/">https://theintercept.com/series/the-teflon-toxin/</a></p>

<p>Some information about immune response to some of these substances: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of synthetic compounds that have widespread use in consumer and industrial applications. PFAS are considered environmental pollutants that have various toxic properties, including effects on the immune system. Recent human studies indicate that prenatal exposure to PFAS leads to suppressed immune responses in early childhood. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25812627">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25812627</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>An NIEHS-funded study linked perfluorinated alkylate substance (PFAS) exposure during infancy to decreased immune response to vaccinations at age 5 years. This study extended previous findings that PFAS exposure may interfere with the effectiveness of some childhood vaccinations and provided new evidence that children may be the most vulnerable during their first 6 months.</p>

<p>The research team studied children in the Faroe Islands, which lie halfway between Scotland and Iceland. The Faroese have PFAS levels similar to those of U.S. residents. PFAS concentrations were measured in the children’s blood at birth, at 18 months, and at 5 years.</p>

<p>In this study, the antibody response to tetanus and diphtheria vaccines was weaker in 5 year olds who had the highest PFAS exposure levels between ages 3 and 6 months. The researchers found that tetanus antibody concentrations at age 5 years were decreased by 19 to 29 percent with each doubling of PFAS exposure in early infancy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/sep/2017/pfas-exposure/index.cfm">https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/sep/2017/pfas-exposure/index.cfm</a></p>

<p>A short article on various chemicals we are exposed to and some of their effects, including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFHxA, and PFBS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The chemicals that stay in our bodies after we die also enter us before we are born, according to research that has found PFAS in umbilical cord blood, in which their levels appear to affect birth weight and immune response.</p>

<p>“When all these thing were put into the marketplace, no one said, ‘There is one downside: It’s going to contaminate the entire living world, including any babies,’” said Ken Cook, president and co-founder of Environmental Working Group.</p>
