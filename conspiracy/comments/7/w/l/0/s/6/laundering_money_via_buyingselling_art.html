<p>But</p>

<p>I swear allot of this art looks pointless and crappy and it sells for millions+</p>

<p>I’ve always thought that it was just mafia cleaning dirty money...</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Edit: here’s an example, chalk scribbles on a blackboard sold for 69 million dollars</p>

<p>“Leading the night was the Twombly “blackboard” painting, Untitled (New York City), 1968, which well exceeded its presale estimate of about $60 million. Covered with his trademark looping white scribbles on a slate-gray background, the work recalls his experience as a cryptologist at the Pentagon.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a bad guy in Ray Donovan (Russian Mafia) using art to smuggle drugs.  Apparently it is a thing that people with power and money and connections can get fine art imported without inspection.  I suspect much of it is used for this purpose among others.</p>

<p>I think the large totals might be difficult to wash but maybe if the gallery does enough legit cash transactions it would work well.  And I suspect something like this is going on with Pizzagate&#39;s Alefantis and his Pegasus Gallery.  They can sell sexually suggestive photos and paintings of kids as art too.  Makes me wonder if it&#39;s a proxy for the victims they traffic and destroy.  Perhaps Podesta&#39;s art display is his hunting trophies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an impossible to prove theory. </p>

<p>Rare art, by virtue of being rare is valuable. But the exact amount cannot be quantified. </p>

<p>If someone wants to sell the art at a certain value which someone is happy to buy it at, then that&#39;s the value of the art. You can&#39;t tell if that transaction is artificial or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what really sucks. To a logical person you can look at what is quite literally scribbles on a chalkboard. I could recreate that bullshit. For 69 million dollars I could buy 69 chalkboards and scribble on it while 69ing a super hot young 20 something girl with huge tits and a great mouth. 69 million? Oh really? Yeah it&#39;s bullshit. The buyer (assumed criminal) can say &quot;oh but it just speaks to me&quot; or some shit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is though, you probably <em>couldn&#39;t</em> create that bs. Because you&#39;d have to be the first to think of it.. AND.. at the same time be established to show that this is a progression of your prior work.
Picasso could literally take a ballpoint pen and make a single line on a piece of paper at it would be worth <em>a lot</em>. But he could only do that because of his prior work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure but the thing is &#39;worth it&#39; ? From an artistic point of view it doesn&#39;t matter, that&#39;s the point. It is <em>all</em> about the prior work building up to it!. It doesn&#39;t matter if it is subjectively &#39;good&#39; or not, it is not <em>supposed</em> to be &#39;good&#39;. It is <em>only</em> about what value the prior art fetched. That&#39;s it. It&#39;s pretty insane really. Basically the more stupid and banal the artwork which can at the same time fetch huge valuations, the bigger the artist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they could absolutely create something very similar if not identical, especially abstract nothingness that takes zero artistic vision or talent to create, like scribbles on a chalkboard. picasso is a good example of the opposite of these fake artist hacks because he helped pioneer an entire genre and style of art.. that&#39;s what makes him one of the greats.. its like kubrick, who made films, same materials and production process, but he helped establish modern filmmaking technique, some practical special effects and cinematography stuff sure, but it was the symbolism and layers of meaning that changed things forever.. his work was priceless, not the prints themselves or even negatives, but the ideas furthered industry and inspired countless future storytellers..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a psyop. The C.I.A. promoted this group of Artists to undermine the Soviets idea of group think.</p>

<p>They promoted Abstract Expressionism as personal freedom for the American Artist.</p>

<p>Abstract Expressionism allowed Artists to freely question the possibilities and limits of a medium.</p>

<p>It is known that Painters, along side Writers and Poets, throughout history, are the ones at the forefront of change. Together they question an establishments ideals and ideas. They are, by their very nature, trouble makers. </p>

<p>It seams clear that the C.I.A. figured this out and thought that a Soviet Artist who sees the Life Magazine spread about Pollack, surrounded by his experimental paintings and unlimited supplies, might look around their government approved studio and their rationed supplies and think.... what the fuck.  And then, I guess,  they would start a revolution or something. </p>

<p>To quote a brilliant critic of 20th century art-</p>

<p>&quot;Art teacher here (bfa, mat). I dont feel like typing a lot on my phone but the reasoning is that he redefined the conversation of what art could be. The fountain is actually considered to be the most important artwork in modern art. &quot;- Zachmorris4187.</p>

<p>I would also like to add the learned observations of QTAnon, who stated in a February 10, 2018 post-</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find lots of people saying that Fountain was a beautiful work of art. Fountain was significant because of the change it represented in what could be considered art and who got to make that decision.&quot;  </p>

<p>The important point of her critic can be found in the last sentence, &quot;...and who got to make that decision.&quot; The brilliance of Duchamp&#39;s &quot;Fountain&quot;/&quot;Urinal&quot; was that HE decided that that urinal, when placed on its side, was art. He found it to be as relevant and as pleasing an object of art as any in the best galleries of the day. The humor of this &quot;Readymade&quot; is that he used a urinal to make his point about the state of art at that time. The Dadaists, Surrealism&#39;s absent parents, were a humorous bunch. They relished wit, wordplay, and chance. They used these muses when they created. Some considered their efforts childish, absurd or irrelevant, and, this pleased them. They truly were the first to question arts possibilities. I think they helped to mold the way we think today. They challenged generations of people to look differently, think differently and play. Every Artist who creates today, probably, owe a thanks to Duchamp, Apollinaire and Rrose Selavy (a leading female voice in the DaDa movement).  Well, BigPharmaSucks, I hope that helped.</p>

<p>You stated: &quot;If you were a true artist you would understand the importance of the Urinal and its place in the artistic evolutionary dialog.&quot;</p>

<p>Now my question to you is: <strong>If your truly knowledgeable and not deflecting or whatever, then can you please provide the important of the Urinal in regards to its place in the artistic evolutionary dialog?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s meant to be &quot;beautiful&quot;, nor does Duchamp consider himself an artist. You may like it or not, but you must recognize Dada for the place it has in Western art history and how it reflects the society of its time. The reason people are interested in a urinal or a picture of a pipe is not because they like the way it look, but because of the story behind it. Art can be more than pretty pictures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most Art markets fluctuate. Demand, rarity  and fashion/popularity are all factors within a market. Buy low, sell high. Relevant in any market- Art- real estate- stocks. Sure, your Da Vinci&#39;s  will hold and increase in their value mostly due to rarity, but what would happen to the Da Vinci market if a trove of his Art work (lets say 4000 pieces)  was found in immaculate condition in an underground cave in Italy? The Da Vinci market would change. Favoring the pieces that are in the best condition meaning that the market(demand) may push down the value of the previous not so well preserved pieces because all these new ones will be flooding the market. The value of Da Vinci&#39;s art is due to its rarity as well as the mystic/brilliance of the Artist.  Hope that helps.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>fiscally smart until all those people try to cash out of a real estate bubble all at once like in 2008 and suddenly the entire global economy nearly collapses.. well, it did, we just made some numbers appear on a screen totally illegally and leveraged the taxes you will pay throughout your working life and those of your unborn grandkids too.. why? because things dont just magically become worth more. especially not real estate that literally adds nothing to society, produces nothing, in fact, it costs quite a lot to maintain a home. everything in this world is only worth what someone will pay. people that buy homes dont even have all the money, they take out a huge loan that would take their entire life to pay off. what people do is after 5 or 10 years, flip it to some other poor young naive kids, pay off the rest of their balance to their bank, and pocket whatevers left, usually reinvesting a good amount on a more expensive home, rinse and repeat. its pretty much a socially acceptable scam that siphons a vast amount of money to whats left of the middle class by way of speculation and cashing out, and that difference where the banks come up short because loans were made where money didnt exist foots the bill to be paid off by future generations as taxes.. ever wonder why this country is the richest in the world but has incredible debt and inequality? its fraud built right into the system and people just think its the way things have to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Art is being used for that a long time, a well known white collar  crime.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t see top criminals walking into a art gallery/auction.
It&#39;s all done thought escrow agents and other 3th party services.</p>

<p>Yet it&#39;s not very exciting. No violence involved 
Media won&#39;t pick it up unless a major bust of some kind even than it won&#39;t make it to the headlines 9 out of 10 times</p>

<p>&quot;This is not confirmed in any way&quot;
Wrong,  It&#39;s confirmed in many ways. 
It&#39;s just a crime form which isn&#39;t well reported. 
Yet very well known to agencies dealing with financial crimes </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this spills into all parts of the art &amp; entertainment world. I&#39;ve made independent regional rock records for years &amp; a couple of years back a CD I made over a decade ago popped up on Amazon from an independent seller for over $600, &amp; from what I can tell, it actually sold. It&#39;s never gone back in print &amp; you can currently get it from around $15 to $60 dollars depending on condition, so the big question is what the fuck did that person actually get for their $600 dollars? And from the perspective of someone laundering money, this kind of thing would be perfect, arrange an illicit sale &amp; direct payment through something like amazon for a &quot;collectible&quot; piece that has no scrutiny placed on it&#39;s value &amp; a shallow market history. If it wasn&#39;t pointed out to me I would have never known &amp; for a week or two I thought I may have actually made something very collectible, but the sad reality is that I most likely made an avatar for something illegal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many artists that work with MOMA and the Tate Modern in London have been affiliated with their respective intelligence agencies. My theory is that it provides a safe money laundering harbor while also allowing said agencies to ship goods for the wealthy patrons they serve in these galleries. </p>

<p>This is a time-honored tradition that&#39;s been happening for hundreds of years, all the way back to the era of the Venetian Secret Service in the 16th century. Cy Twombly&#39;s links to the Pentagon can&#39;t be ignored; so many contemporary artists are either affiliated with intelligence or have friends in &quot;high places&quot;, be it Jackson Pollock working for the OSS/CIA in the 40s, Warhol mingling with the Whitney/Rockefeller cohort, or artists like Jeff Koons and Marina Abramovic who rub shoulders with the Rothschilds and Habsburgs. </p>

<p>Contemporary art is one of they keys to one of the larger modern conspiracies out there, but the extent to which it&#39;s used in this way is hard to calculate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>how about the drug trade? the narcos cocaine stuff especially. CIA defintely worked both sides of the trade, and while war on drugs allowed more tax payer dollars to be spent on militarizing police, the cash paid by citizens could come right back to CIA and FBI to pay for clandestine operations from buying dictatorships to developing secret technology without needing to be accountable for showing what the money is spent on.. and still the pentagon has known black budget projects they say need to remain classified for national security.. its a joke but not very funny considering were are subsidizing our enslavement to the system and an elite class without a face.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually studied fine art ( which focused on contemporary works ) for my BA.</p>

<p>Many institutions like BP Oil sponsor art galleries to appeal to consumers and hide the fact they destroy oceans with oil spills. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned as well that to be successful in &quot;art&quot; today, you don&#39;t have to be talented ( although it helps), you need to have a &quot;concept&quot;, and you need to be fake as f. I found very little genuine people in art, and so much bullshit. Even I was bullshitting after 3 years. I was a genuine person before I went to that school and at the end of 3 years I became one of those [e]ntitled works of art...</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m graduated, looking towards my future with hopes of doing gradschool, possibly in a different area than Fine Art ( Maybe art history ? ), I&#39;m working in a gallery that houses Caravaggios ( the art my school rejected ) and I see that modern art is a croc, and nothing will ever replace the truly beautiful works of skill from our bygone days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure money gets laundered through art sales. I&#39;m 100 per cent sure. But the art doesn&#39;t need to be this crap! It could still be decent art ,just overpriced. I wouldn&#39;t pay 69 pence for that ! Art is like the music and film industry,It&#39;s not what you know or can do it&#39;s who you know. So useless rich kids can churn out a load of crap and the &quot;experts&quot; ,probably friends of the artists parents ,will say it&#39;s genious,and if you think it&#39;s crap then you don&#39;t understand art or havnt interpreted it properly </p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry, i wasnt disagreeing with you per say i just was making a long winded point about how whats perceived in our world as making smart monetary decisions to create wealth doesnt mean money just actually appears on its own.. like with your art and land examples of how they appreciate when they actually dont, and the money extracted from the housing market is actually just indebted to the poor and future generations.. i know my generation is having a very tough time just keeping up with the cost of living. why cant millenials afford houses and cars and saving money like just our parents could 20 to 30 years ago, and on one income at that? the appreciating real estate has raised CoL even for renting.. stagnating wages coupled with inflation and the outsourcing and automating production has left the US with the majority of jobs being retail and customer service industry entry level work, while the skilled job sector for the most part has grown marginally but most positions are still occupied by our parents gen.. capitalism it at odds with technology.. to keep profit margins the necessity to cut labor and automate is slowly slowing the entire economy because the labor for is paid less and cant buy the goods produced, this leads to ever more outsourcing and labor cuts.. immigrants are blamed, lazy millenials are blamed, and its all distraction to defer attention from a 1percent that holds 50percent of the wealth of the world.. in fact 90percent of americans are left with only 10percent of total annual workforce income.. and this is the tip of the iceberg.. Artificial Intelligence is already taking over in a big way as i type this and some projections are looking at 35percent unemployment by 2030.. and yet, since 2008 the government has been claiming the economy is recovering strongly, millions of jobs are created each year, and the stock market is at all time highs so have no fear!.. its all lies. the global economy is on life support, and when this new bubble pops there may not be any coming back.. the federal reserve only could avert total disaster by having a fire sale in bonds to any country that would buy them.. student debt is 1.4 trillion and no jobs to pay those off.. that bubble alone has enslaved dozens of millions of young people.. but hey, weeds legal now so at least you can get high and try to forget about all that.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you! most responses i receive when i write about these things are dismissive and ridiculing. i understand a cynical response though.. these are heavy issues we face today and the challenges that lie ahead are immense for everybody involved. with that in mind, i encourage myself and others to try to have compassion for the financial elite, because while it&#39;s statistically feasible they&#39;re all sociopaths (1 in 25), I know enough about those &quot;empathically-challenged&quot; that despite notoriously selfish behavior, they can have the motivation to work towards positive outcomes too, so long as there is a shared mutual self-interest amongst them. that being said, our day and age allows a relative handful of individuals to hold a level of power over the remaining billions that is unfathomable to your everyday human.. the illusion is unravelling, i know that much, and while my generation (millennials) is mostly busy trying to survive, get our lives together into a stable trajectory, we are not complacent, and i hear more and more theoretical ways of living that are sustainable, ethical, and better than the hand we were dealt.. even the generation of my parents, while still pressing their values of the importance of hard work and persistence, are becoming more and more sympathetic to the bourdon on their children.. i had a great conversation with my parents one time that really brought them around to awareness about how the mobility up the wealth ladder they enjoyed is becoming more and more elusive.. i&#39;m up to snuff on the real estate bubbles and how they work because my parents used that mechanism to their advantage, and i enjoyed a life coming up in a solid middle class lifestyle in a small town on the ocean where we had want for nothing.. i had a great education and was encouraged to follow my dreams.. lucky for me, the film industry is one while hard to break into is not one in danger of collapse or outsourcing.. but i digress.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my proposal is this.. we need to let the elite off the hook. if we back them into a corner, they will become more dangerous than even billions of revolutionaries could overcome.. a violent overthrow of the institutions that oppress us won&#39;t work.. one so-called conspiracy theory that really has stuck in my mind is how if things unravel too quickly for the elite to enact a new system of economy and distribution of resources, they will simply push the eject button and reset society the hard way.. but how? global thermonuclear warfare is off the table save maybe some rogue terrorist event, as the elite want the earth somewhat salvageable for their own enjoyment.. although there is much noise about the science on climate change being up for debate even after all this time, the truth is an abrupt climate shift is well underway, least of all, the anthropocene extinction event is decimating the wildlife diversity of the biosphere.. if the food chain collapses due to pollution and deforestation, billions of humans will end up perishing.. there is proof that the deep state is not only aware this is happening, but is currently implementing emergency measures to slow the run-a-way greenhouse effect through a geoengineering program that history will reflect on as one of the single largest military backed endeavors of humanity.. one aspect that is ridiculed and dismissed with a fervor by the media and CIA covert agents on the internet is the &quot;chemtrail&quot; phenomenon.. they love to use that word specifically because the general population tunes out when they hear it, and even so-called whistleblowers on youtube and other social media outlets (even reddit), will present the truth in such a grating context co-mingled with outright ridiculous other conspiracies like flat-earther BS or mass mind-control operations.. in truth, chemtrails are slang for a subset of geoengineering science called SRM, solar radiation management.. the premise is simple, raise the albedo of the planet artificially by dispersing nano-particulate of reflective aerosols (aluminum, barium, and strontium have been confirmed in laboratory samples by modern day hero and climate scientist Dane Wigington.. check out his site geoengineering-watch.org for a comprehensive breakdown of geoengineering happening today, and in fact has been happening for about 2 decades but implemented so slowly no-one seemed to notice that now when a plane flies overhead, sometimes it leaves a &quot;persistent contrail&quot; that doesn&#39;t evaporate within seconds as a true condensation trail would but instead spreads out and blocks out the sun, sometimes growing the cloud cover exponentially if silver oxides happen to be in the mix.. he cites about 150 patents that are specifically for geoengineering, the literal technology that military contractors like Raytheon and McDonnell Douglas created for this singular purpose.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>these nano-particulate he says are so small and by design that they are not detectable with even the most stringent pollution sensors, we&#39;re talking one micron in diameter, which is exponentially smaller than pollution particulate, single atoms of the stuff.. they&#39;ve been spraying so much of the stuff, &quot;free&quot; aluminum can now be quantified contaminating every inch of land, in rain run-off, sea-creatures, etc.. the artificial cloud layer mitigates some of the suns energy from becoming trapped, and thus slowing the speed that the atmosphere is heating.. this is a band-aid on the issue because the amount of Co2 released year after year only grows.. and now for the scary part.. the permafrost of the arctic is thawing and methane hydrates is dumping into the atmosphere.. methane is lighter than most other gases and is rising above everything to the ozone layer, creating effectively what could be described as a glass ceiling.. methane is even more potent than Co2, and one a ten year time line is several fold more heating than Co2.. the great danger of this is creating an environment where the oceans super heat and not only rise in volume but due to thermal expansion.. no more white poles of ice on earth makes things even worse.. worst case scenario is that earth suffers a &quot;venus syndrome&quot; and the surface of the planet will become unliveable, hundreds of degrees but even at the poles nothing will grow because the hydrological cycle will all but fail, so ozone replenishment will cease.. the ozone layer is arguably the most life-essential aspect of our planet.. in a healthy atmosphere, on UV-A radiation reaches the surface, UV-B stopped many miles up, and UV-C at the ozone layer.. normally, UV-C reacts with the free radicals of Oxygen and binds them to O2.. this O3 is the ozone layer.. UV-C is the spectrum of energy just before X-ray, although for life using the DNA template, UV-C is the most dangerous.. this is because UV-C is resonant at the specific energy of DNA, and even small doses of it literally breaks apart the DNA so that it cannot function correctly.. Skin Cancer is thought to occur from even minute amounts that reach the surface.. germicidal lamps in laboratories are UV-C and they kill everything.. current measurements of UV have confirmed that the C-band is indeed reaching the surface, even with the SRM program blocking most of it, detectable levels deliver enough UV-C in one minute of sun exposure that is the upper limit for what is considered a &quot;safe&quot; daily dose.. this is already reeking havoc on plant life, and without plantlife to produce oxygen, the ozone layer cannot be replenished, and a vicious feedback loop is initiated that could result in surface sterilization of earth by the end of the century.. the one podcast i listened to had this former NASA scientist who espoused the the SRM program was accelerating this process further, as the nano-particulate binds with free-radicals of oxygen before they can even reach the top of the atmosphere.. he said he can&#39;t even give an accurate estimate of how much of the ozone layer actually remains because he can&#39;t &quot;see through&quot; the chemtrail bullshit.. it was one of the most frightening things i think i&#39;ve ever heard in my life..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i just feel so bad for the animal life that is dying off at 1000x the background extinct rate, we&#39;re talking hundreds of species a day.. Every. Day.. the whales in the ocean have burned backsides from when they breach.. the trees south-facing side are having their bark striped away.. deciduous trees that lose their leaves are beginning to not ever come out of dormancy, because their buds are sun-burned off before they have a chance.. one thing is certain, these programs are an all out assault against life on earth, and one of the greatest crimes against humanity ever perpetrated.. also, aluminum is more toxic to the human nervous system than every mercury, and the nano-particulate enters our bodies and binds to the nerve endings, accumulating in the brain and eventually kills the nerve entirely because it&#39;s so small, it works on the neurotransmitter system but can never be metabolized out.. i hear magnesium supplements can be ingested to try to capture some on the aluminum in the bloodstream and be excreted but that&#39;s about it.. but get this.. many things the military industrial complex does serve more than one purpose.. the chemtrail matter makes the atmosphere more conductive, so using high powered radio and microwave arrays (this HAARP), the geoengineers have become weather-manipulators to boot.. mimicking the mechanism of the sun upon the earth, coordinating dozens of the arrays across the country it is possible to create high and low pressure systems and steer moisture systems to designated areas.. this ongoing draught in california is most likely exacerbated if not caused entirely.. HAARP also has a neat trick of super heating small areas of the ionosphere of periods of hours or days to create extremely powerful weather effects, like hurricane suppression and the opposite, hurricane intensification.. some people believe the lack of hurricanes after the devastating season of 2005 was to mitigate one of the major issues of a heating planet, an over-active hydrological cycle which should be mother nature&#39;s way of coping and slowing global warming by dumping hot ocean water onto land, but it appears hurricanes have all but been ceased outright.. but then the next logical step is to ask why were there super hurricanes sandy and katrina and one that flooded houston last year, is it really coincidence these storms of the century had direct impacts into these specific areas, acting as weaponized weather events? but why? maybe to stimulate the economy with the resulting clean-up and rebuilding? maybe as distractions at just the right time to fill up MSM with 24hour coverage of the spectacle that left government atrocities coming to light the last thing anyone could worry about let alone remember after the fact.. holy shit. this is becoming a symposium on the end of the world.. to finally address your questions. no, debt will probably not be written off but mitigated, it&#39;s just too convenient a controlling force and is really the best way to keep track of wealthy or not individuals.. when the shit hits the fan, the first world countries will receive bail-outs and aid first under strict martial law of course.. the job thing, well, how would people be paid? credits? or do people just work maybe 3months out of the year with the promise they&#39;ll have their basic needs met? probably maintaining the automated systems that do all the heavy lifting, chosen at random through lottery of when you work.. of course, beyond that there will be decentralized communities where people can work the jobs they want and are good at to contribute something extra to the world.. houses can be 3D printed, yet, and the oil will be gone eventually.. i&#39;ve heard we are at peak oil now and the reserves are keeping prices steady but apparently it&#39;s going to get harder and more expensive to get at the oil that remains, at that point, the economy should naturally shift to renewables because price alone.. did you hear trump put tariffs on solar? i wonder why.. seriously, i need to see what his genius excuse is for that one.. i dunno, based on our societies current trajectory and climate issues alone, i think creating a utopia from within the system is futile.. decentralizing and having smaller self-sustaining cities, states, nations will be the answer.. check out the zeitgeist movement.. they have some good ideas about getting it done.. also, peter joseph&#39;s book, the new human rights movement.. best thing i&#39;ve read in a long long time..</p>
