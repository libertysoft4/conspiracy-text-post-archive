        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some of the greatest minds in physics have known that the Universe is not a purely mechanistic, materialist, reductionist phenomena. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.”</p>

<p>&quot;Quantum physics thus reveals the basic oneness of the Universe&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The total number of minds in the Universe is one&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>― Erwin Schrödinger</p>

<p>Nobel prize 1933, enormously advanced quantum physics</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about the atoms this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. . . . We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Spirit. This Spirit is the matrix of all matter.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Max Planck</p>

<p>Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Birthed Quantum Mechanics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Werner Heisenberg</p>

<p>Nobel prize 1932, enormously advanced quantum physics</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It from Bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom — at a very deep bottom, in most instances — an immaterial source and explanation; that what we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions and the registering of equipment-evoked responses; in short, that all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- John Archibald Wheeler</p>

<p>Coined &quot;black hole&quot; to objects with gravitational collapse already predicted early in the 20th century, and coined the terms &quot;quantum foam&quot;, &quot;neutron moderator&quot;, &quot;wormhole&quot; and &quot;it from bit&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Metaphysical has been science’s designation for all weightless phenomena such as thought. But science has made no experimental finding of any phenomena that can be described as a solid, or as continuous, or as a straight surface plane, or as a straight line, or as infinite anything. We are now synergetically forced to conclude that all phenomena are metaphysical; wherefore, as many have long suspected — like it or not — life is but a dream.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Buckminster Fuller</p>

<p>Second World President of Mensa from 1974 to 1983, architect, systems theorist, author, designer, and inventor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Albert Einstein</p>

<p>Nobel Prize in Physics 1921</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Science is incompetent to reason upon the creation of matter itself out of nothing. We have reached the utmost limit of our thinking faculties when we have admitted that because matter cannot be eternal and self-existent it must have been created.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- James Maxwell </p>

<p>One of the most profound physicists of all time. Greatly advanced understanding of electromagnetic fields</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“God is a mathematician of a very high order and He used advanced mathematics in constructing the universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Paul Dirac</p>

<p>Enormously advanced quantum physics and quantum electrodynamics. Shared Nobel Prize with Shrodinger.</p>

<p>This is literally &#39;renormalized&#39; in quantum theory, which is a fancy word that means the math is manipulated to remove the infinites, though the infinites are exactly where the answer lies (space is curved to singularity at each point due to this immense amount of energy, that&#39;s how it&#39;s holographic)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even that is irrelevant. Empty space is still sensual (sound is related to space as touch is related to air as sight is related to heat as is related to liquid as smell is related to solid. Physical is meaningless. Everything is sensual. Everything is experienced by consciousness. </p>

<p>Space can only be heard (sound can&#39;t be felt, unless it is moving air)
Air can be heard and felt (wind is heard and felt)
Heat can be heard , felt, and seen (an explosion is only heard felt and seen)
Liquid can be heard, felt, seen, and tasted (liquid only smells if it has a solid dissolved in it)
Solids can be heard, felt, seen, tasted, and heard </p>
