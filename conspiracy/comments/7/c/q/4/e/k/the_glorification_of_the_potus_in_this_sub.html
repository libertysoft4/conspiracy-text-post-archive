        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Greetings all of my brothers and sisters of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  While I can imagine what the predictable &quot;far-left&quot; or &quot;far-right&quot; responses will be to such a topic in this sub, I honestly want to spark a discussion and hopefully generate some dialogue for this community to do some reflecting on.  </p>

<p>I have been reading this sub for MANY years. I was reading articles and discussions here for years before I even signed up for an account so I could participate (and oh, what a different place this (and Reddit) was back then) and am now a 4 year member. </p>

<p>While Bush was president, this sub was extremely critical of him, as expected.</p>

<p>While Obama was president, this sub was extremely critical of him, as expected.</p>

<p>It honestly seems as if half of the articles posted about Trump in this sub are positive while the other half are extremely critical of him. I&#39;m not sure if this is by design - meaning that TPTB/Reddit have truly left us devoid of any platform to discuss things without being controlled/influenced/infiltrated by disinformation, divide-and-conquer techniques, and racist agent provocateurs. </p>

<p>I understand that Trump lead his campaign with the promise of &quot;draining the swamp,&quot; ending corruption, and bringing the power back to the people, but  anybody who still believes that is either dillusional or just plain retarded  (pardon my French). </p>

<p>So I guess my confusion is - WHAT REALLY <em>HAS</em> HAPPENED TO THIS SUB?  Is it just more of this &quot;T_D takeover&quot; that has been going on for the past year? </p>

<p>Is all this 4Chan L.A.R.P. stuff planted disinfo a psyop by the Trump Administration to co-opt and reinforce faith in the same constituents that drove him to the White House and keep their loyalty?</p>

<p>Have we just come so far from our original purpose here and this sub literally doesn&#39;t represent what it was created to be? We now praise our POTUS? Meanwhile, the most probable and provable conspiracy theories that we can point to in the political spectrum lead directly to his doorstep.......</p>

<p>Maybe he IS super smart. Smart enough that his main goal is psychological warfare against his own people (?). Or maybe there are just too many internet savvy people who are so obsessed with him that they&#39;re unwittingly doing his dirty work for him?</p>

<p>Thoughts.....?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that he is. Entertainment, or at least his selected format of reality tv, doesn&#39;t benefit much from globalism as much as other industries.</p>

<p>And real estate doesn&#39;t mix very well with globalism.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not a &quot;globalist puppet,&quot; just that his professional background is not that invested in globalism.</p>

<p>After 8 years and a bureaucracy stuffed with radically liberals/progressives, I just might settle for that form of &quot;draining the swamp.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pay attention to all that is happening.  Do you enjoy OPEC and our dependency on oil and gas? Do you love banks raping everyone? How about all the JFK files.  Does it make you happy that CIA/FBI worked to assassinate a great president and lied to the public? What else have they done for profit for Rothschild? What would Clinton had done today? Push for more dependency on Saud? Yup.  Pushed for identity politics? Yup  Favored more tax on middle class? Yup.  Go to war for Rothschild? Yup. The same slave style of do more for the elites and fuck the peasants. Bush, Obama, Clinton</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a hard time with Trumps appointees.  I know that Clinton was supposed to win.  I wasn&#39;t a fan of Trump.  But after the election I couldn&#39;t help but think how fucking bad the media predicted the election.  I&#39;m a data scientist and I know how and who does the analysis for the media.   They don&#39;t fall this hard on their face.  Especially when simple survey and analysis done by private companies painted a very different picture.  Most likely NSA or someone stopped CIA from rigging the election in Clinton&#39;s favor.  Sorry if you don&#39;t believe it but I&#39;m certain that was the case.  They expected her to win.  Also keep in mind that Trump is NOT the master here.  Some group of people have selected Trump to play this part.  He is working with them.  So when you play politics at that level - you have to do certain things that sometimes don&#39;t make sense to others.  </p>

<p>What is even more interesting? Liberals for years have been against big government, banks, OPEC, big Oil, wars and so forth.  Now they are adamantly against what is happening here because Trump is the face leading the charge.   The media has literally taken everything they believe in and made them hate it because of 1 man.  </p>

<p>Sorry for ranting.  </p>

<p>What planet do you live on?  He has the former chairman of Exxon as his secretary of state, he has lifted regulations on banks,  and he has increased military spending and threatened war against several countries.  When have liberals been against OPEC?  The only people against OPEC are big american oil companies, not liberals.  Trump is leading the charge for US corporations, not  liberalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s still early so many supporters are still hopeful. So far he ended the CIA&#39;s Syrian terrorist program (although the Pentagon is still meddling), and he enforces existing Immigration Law. The majority of the Liberal Mainstream Media are attacking Trump voters 24/7, as well as inciting real-life violence against since the campaign trail. These attacks, often seen as hypocritical and superficial, are isolating the community as victims and serve to embolden their support of POTUS. I don&#39;t trust the guy or anybody else in politics, but it is interesting enough to watch. Let&#39;s focus on his actual policies, good and bad, and refrain from fanaticism on both sides i.e. MAGA-boosting and Donald-shaming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the flaw people fall into is that Trump receives so much negative press from MSM that he must be against the establishment and they&#39;re all against him. First, this is the message Trump/Bannon weaved from the start- us versus them. He plays into it, instigates it, flames it and the media loves it. No one really watches cable news or read newspapers, so they need drama to suck people in to watching for ratings. He helps them with his tweets, in party leaks, basically the same negative media presence he&#39;s always sought. As long as your name is out there, you&#39;re relevant.</p>

<p>Second, people forget the negative press of George W and Clinton during their first 100 days. Both hadn&#39;t accomplished anything, no significant legislation passed and did stupid things in public (Bushisms and Clinton scandals popping up). Bush got to have the whole 9/11 to conveniently prop him up to a second term and change the press for a while. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we get a fake war soon for Trump.</p>

<p>Lastly, everything leading up to the election showed that people simply (and rightly) hated Hillary more than they hated Trump. Lesser of two evils was the term bandied about. Even here it is &quot;yeah he&#39;s a crook, but it would be worse with Hillary.&quot; True, but doesn&#39;t mean Trump has our best interests in mind or is some revolutionary comrade. At least Trump is entertaining, even if his campaign promises were just populist rhetoric and his administration is filled with bankers/liars/Zionists.</p>

<p>It honestly seems as if half of the articles posted about Trump in this sub are positive while the other half are extremely critical of him. I&#39;m not sure if this is by design - meaning that TPTB/Reddit have truly left us devoid of any platform to discuss things without being controlled/influenced/infiltrated by disinformation, divide-and-conquer techniques, and racist agent provocateurs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like the simplest explanation.</p>

<p>After years of being dominated by left-wing shills, Reddit is now a battleground for shills from both sides. This sub is particularly prone in that it does not maintain the strict ideological bubble seen in other subs, nor does it ban users simply for being subscribed to blacklisted subs.</p>
