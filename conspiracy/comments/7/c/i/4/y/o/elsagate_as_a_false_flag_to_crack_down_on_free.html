        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What if people with a desire to suppress free speech are creating these videos, not to target children, but to make it appear as though people are <em>trying</em> to target children? This would give youtube an excuse to engage in greater censorship, and as net neutrality is likely to be a thing of the past soon the role that major sites like youtube play in dispersing information will only become greater. If youtube can convince people that suppressing free speech is a good thing (think of the children!) it will only become more normalized. </p>

<p>The truth is that relying on automated content filters to provide children with appropriate content was a terrible idea to begin with. When we have better AI this may well become feasible, but as our technology stands right now it simply isn&#39;t viable to expect a content filter to do a perfect job. It&#39;s fucked up that these videos are being made, but consider carefully what the appropriate response should be. Parents should be given an easy way (if one doesn&#39;t already exist) to put their children&#39;s accounts in a whitelist mode, such that they can only view specifically approved channels and videos. Watch carefully for the backlash of elsagate to move into freedom of speech suppressing territory. </p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the views of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and similar communities are easily influenced by moral outrage into supporting short-sighted opinions. Think long-term. Freedom of speech is the real thing at risk here, there are better ways of protecting children than empowering censorship.</p>

<p>Honestly, it seems like people with little grasp of the English language are eking out a living with stupid video arbitrage.

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about this, but then I noticed that a lot of these users that upload them seem like pedophiles, and the &quot;gibberish&quot; comments actually contain content related to human trafficking and murder when decoded.
 I haven&#39;t figured out every method used to write these coded messages, but I noticed that a lot of them are letters and numbers meant to be typed on a Thai keyboard. If you type it on the Thai keyboard and translate it to English, you have hidden messages. 
I assume that some of the ones that I haven&#39;t been able to figure out may just be children typing random keys, but I don&#39;t think they would comment on somebody else&#39;s comment if that were the case. I&#39;ve also noticed that a lot of these comments are HUGE chains of dozens of comments and most have many likes, so it cannot just be children. 
This is definitely something. There is a possibility that it may be bots, but I don&#39;t think that bots would talk about arranging meetings and discuss prices in Bitcoin...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Parents should be given an easy way (if one doesn&#39;t already exist) to put their children&#39;s accounts in a whitelist mode, such that they can only view specifically approved channels and videos. </p>

<p>Past that, you are trusting an automated filter. That is poor parenting.</p>

I would be completely fine with rounding up the people who made these videos, and hanging them in a public place until they are dead. And anyone who supports pedo speech with them, you faggot. </p>
