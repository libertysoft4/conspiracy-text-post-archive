<p>I don&#39;t like the idea of leaving something so important up to chance. I would rather take the safe route and do it as well as possible. There is a big responsibility here.

    <div class="md"><p>Most people won&#39;t read the info.. that&#39;s why I need to do a video. To try to make it as entertaining as possible. If nothing else it makes it a bit less dry than reading... I could offer it both ways though.</p>

<p>I already tried to tell my story in a script form and people wouldn&#39;t bother reading that. And I tried to make it an entertaining story.</p>

<p>This gets back to my point.. if you aren&#39;t talented at presenting info people struggle to get through it. People have been spoiled. I don&#39;t think this is an accident either. It&#39;s part of the game. Part of suppressing information. Info wars....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s more important though.. the way the info is presented or the info?</p>

<p>If how the info is presented is anywhere near as important or more important than the info then do you see the problem? There are other aspects of this you would have to know the info to understand though... </p>

<p>Let me put it this way.. imagine if you were the keeper of the secrets.. how could you make it difficult or impossible for someone to get important info out if they had it? Again.. this is all part of &quot;info wars&quot;... this is what I have to battle. If it was easy don&#39;t you think it would be done already? What do you think stops the truth from getting out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that is why they are winning this info war.. they understand this.. Again.. without understanding it all you can&#39;t see that. It&#39;s essentially disinformation.</p>

<p>Let me put it to you this way.. Imagine I told you to explain to some random person on the street why you are a conspiracy theorist. Imagine how difficult that would be. Now ask yourself why that is... why it is so difficult. The same reason it is so difficult for us to explain this to the average person is the same reason it is so difficult to get deeper truths out. It is the complexity... the devil in the details.. the more important the truth the more difficult it is to get out.. because they have made it that way.. using the same methods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a higher plane anymore than you are on a higher plane than the people who don&#39;t believe in conspiracy theories at all. We are all brainwashed to some degree.</p>

<p>I was just in a position where I was on a path to finding the truth - in certain areas.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not something that is easy to understand. There are reasons I can&#39;t just make those things known here. I have to do that when the time is right. If I try to deliver the overall truths before I can explain why I knew this is the answer then I may be stopped before I can get the truth out..</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t responding to my points. You have just made up your mind and are ignoring the reality. It isn&#39;t easy for you to explain the the average person why they should believe in conspiracies for the exact same reason it isn&#39;t easy for me to explain to everyone here what I have discovered... in both situations it is rare knowledge. I have simply put the time into it.. time that others haven&#39;t. Imagine a college professor trying to explain an advanced concept to a student.. it takes time for people to understand these things. Especially when there are forces working to prevent people from understanding them.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t think I needed to explain that.. but you are ignoring the reality of the situation. How do you know info is easy enough to convey in one post? And even if it was if it was all text most people wouldn&#39;t read it.. just like you say you have no reason to believe me they wouldn&#39;t have a reason to go through all the reading and thinking necessary. So I have to make that as easy to consume as possible.. and it&#39;s going to take time. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying &quot;why didn&#39;t Einstein just say E=MC2 and everyone hailed him a genius. There are things Einstein said that haven&#39;t been proven until modern times. </p>

<p>My discovers are on that level.. they aren&#39;t easy to understand or believe or prove.. it took me years of study and maybe a whole lifetime to get to this point.</p>

<p>I could tell you why that is.. but I want to include that in my info. What you don&#39;t realize is that if I don&#39;t do this right others will take info I put out and use it for their own purposes.. this has already happened. When this happens it dilutes my message.. then people have even less of a reason to take what I say seriously. Again, these are things you simply can&#39;t understand until you have tried to get info out. It&#39;s an impossible puzzle to solve. They have created this environment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it isn&#39;t easy to get this info out ASAP. This info is different than something like what Snowden puts out or Assange or something like that.</p>

<p>Like I said before.. this is something that requires a lot of study and thought. If I just told you what it was you would think it was crazy and there is no easy way to convince you. They have set it up this way as well.</p>

<p>But see even explaining this to you now gives away important info.. because it is part of my unique story. So let&#39;s say someone who really IS out for attention or money takes my story and uses it for their own content and they have an audience and I don&#39;t then I just look like someone trying to copy them rather than the other way around. This is why people like you being so skeptical and distrusting and accusatory is so damaging to someone like me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Others have said this too.. it isn&#39;t about glory. There is important stuff that needs to be done with this info and I believe I know how it should be done and what should be done.</p>

<p>You and others just have a negative and paranoid mindset. Again.. you can&#39;t know the issues with this if you haven&#39;t been involved in this.</p>

<p>I have tried to contact journalists and other mainstream people.. and tried to give them the whole story. But like you they have no reason to believe me or I can&#39;t even get their attention.</p>

<p>So again.. you are just speaking from a place of paranoia and lack of understanding. And it&#39;s sad because you and others are shooting yourselves in the foot.. the truth could be out if people just open their minds ironically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Robot voice is extremely unprofessional. It is the quickest way to ensure that people do not listen to or watch your video.</p>

<p>Speaking in such a way that you have control over exactly how you say it is not an innate ability, it is a trained skill. If you do not train yourself to modulate your voice, then you will not be able to do so. Everyone can do it. Whether or not you want to work at it is a different issue. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t speak to your audience, then perhaps you have nothing to say. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It takes time though.. and a good speaking voice. And as I said there is an immense amount of info I need to convey. If this was just a short video then you would be correct.. I could do that. But trying to do that for the amount of info I need to convey is overwhelming or would take too long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people won&#39;t read the info.. that&#39;s why I need to do a video. To try to make it as entertaining as possible. If nothing else it makes it a bit less dry than reading... I could offer it both ways though.</p>

<p>I already tried to tell my story in a script form and people wouldn&#39;t bother reading that. And I tried to make it an entertaining story.</p>

<p>This gets back to my point.. if you aren&#39;t talented at presenting info people struggle to get through it. People have been spoiled. I don&#39;t think this is an accident either. It&#39;s part of the game. Part of suppressing information. Info wars....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t reading my replies though. I already went over that.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t responding to my points. You have just made up your mind and are ignoring the reality. It isn&#39;t easy for you to explain the the average person why they should believe in conspiracies for the exact same reason it isn&#39;t easy for me to explain to everyone here what I have discovered... in both situations it is rare knowledge. I have simply put the time into it.. time that others haven&#39;t. Imagine a college professor trying to explain an advanced concept to a student.. it takes time for people to understand these things. Especially when there are forces working to prevent people from understanding them.</p>

<p>I have tried to contact journalists and other mainstream people.. and tried to give them the whole story. But like you they have no reason to believe me or I can&#39;t even get their attention.</p>

<p>So again.. you are just speaking from a place of paranoia and lack of understanding. And it&#39;s sad because you and others are shooting yourselves in the foot.. the truth could be out if people just open their minds ironically.</p>
