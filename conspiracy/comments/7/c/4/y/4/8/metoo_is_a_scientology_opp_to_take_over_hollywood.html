        <h3 class="title">#metoo is a Scientology opp to take over Hollywood.</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/IllJimKong.html">IllJimKong</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>First, a TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>I believe Scientology is either the architect behind the #metoo movement and is motivating or had motivated victims to come forward. Or they have seized on the opportunity provided by the drama and are using this as a way to purge Hollywood of non Scientologists and replace them with their own people. Whether orchestrated by them or just exploited... this is a take over. The next 5k words are just proof. </p>

<p>For the sake of argument I want to get some stuff out of the way. I&#39;ve seen on this sub and others that users don&#39;t necessarily believe everything being said in the media about these cases. That is fine. I can&#39;t change your mind on that. There seems to be about three different opinions on the accusations: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>All of the accusers are telling the truth, this is a purge that is long over due. </p></li>
<li><p>Some of the accusers are legitimate and some of them are lying. People are innocent until proven guilty. </p></li>
<li><p>All of them are lying for fame/money/attention</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My theory is reasonable no matter which of above three stances you take on this issue. What is important is that the accusations themselves are working to tear down the old structures of Hollywood. It is a cynically genius move to start something like this because the amount of sexual misconduct in Hollywood which could be used as Kompromat is never ending. </p>

<p><strong>Theory</strong></p>

<p>Those of you paying attention may have noticed that Leah Remini has basically outed Scientology as a rape cult. Yet none of the accusers or accused are Scientologist&#39;s (save for one who we discuss later). Seems odd. Especially with the sheer number of people coming forward compared to how many people in Hollywood are Scientologists. </p>

<p>I propose that this whole #metoo thing is a Scietol opp designed to re-arrange, and grab power within Hollywood. A full and complete takeover if you will. Not to say the accusations are or are not true. But rather the sordid histories of these actors/directors/producers are being used as the fuel to dismantle the old guard and replace it with Scientology. Does that sound crazy? Well they&#39;ve done massive opps like this before. </p>

<p>Take for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White.">&#39;Operation Snow White&#39;</a> A massive coordinated conspiracy to purge any negative press, reports, or incriminating evidence of Scientology from government and legal databases nation wide. Sound crazy? It happened and it worked. </p>

<p>There was also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Normandy">&#39;Project Normandy&#39;</a> A plot to literally take over a small city in Florida. This one was halted by authorities before it went live. </p>

<p>How about  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Freakout">&#39;Operation Freakout&#39;</a> A proven coordinated gang stalking plot to have a journalist imprisoned in a psychiatric hospital for speaking out against them in a critical article in a major magazine. </p>

<p>And of course everyone&#39;s favorite - the long and complex story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_status_of_Scientology_in_the_United_States#Further_litigation">how Scientology gained tax exempt status.</a> There are a half dozen other opps listed on that page. If you need proof that Scientology is capable of, or willing to pull of massive, coordinated opps than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_status_of_Scientology_in_the_United_States#Espionage">look no further.</a></p>

<p>So, first I dismiss arguments of whether the accusations are real or fake as irrelevant. Now I have provided proof of Scientology conducting massive opps like this on a regular basis. But what proof do I have of Scientology actually being behind the #metoo purge? Well none. Other than they have the means, motive, and opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>But consider this</strong> 
Remember when it was revealed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/07/harvey-weinstein-hired-ex-mossad-agents-to-suppress-abuse-allegations-new-yorker-report-claims">Weinstein hired former Mossad agents to investigate and trail Rose Mcgowan?</a> What if they were also working for Scientology? Not to discredit her, but rather to vet her. Make sure that she was the perfect cancer victim / hero to start this cookie crumbling.  </p>

<p><strong>Circumstantial evidence</strong></p>

<p>Two final things to consider: <a href="http://people.com/tv/why-anthony-rapp-revealed-kevin-spacey-allegedly-inappropriate-sexual-advances/">Anthony Rapp accused Kevin Spacey of lewd conduct some 30 years ago.</a> This one accusation was enough for <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/netflix-is-done-with-kevin-spacey">Netflix to cancel it&#39;s marquee show &quot;House of Cards&quot; and drop Spacey as it&#39;s star.</a> Pretty big reaction. </p>

<p>Meanwhile four women have accused Scientologist Danny Masterson of violent rape, the LAPD and the District Attorney are investigating. Masterson costars on a Netflix show which isn&#39;t very popular. It wouldn&#39;t cost them much to cancel the show or drop Masterson from it altogether, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/danny-masterson-rape-accusations_us_59fa8410e4b01b474048242a">but instead they have done and said NOTHING about it.</a> </p>

<p><strong>MEANWHILE..</strong>
This is all happening while Donald <em>drain the swamp</em> Trump is <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-scientology-tax-exemption_us_5a04dd35e4b05673aa584cab">musing over revoking Scientologies tax exempt status</a>. Why bring that up now, in fact why bring it up at all? What might he know?</p>

<p><strong>Things to Consider</strong> 
In the days and weeks that follow, don&#39;t argue about whether or not the accusations are true -that doesn&#39;t matter anymore- if the accused are Jewish (distraction) or whether they are republican or democrat. Notice whether any of them are Scietol and if they are what happens to them when they are accused. </p>

<p>And think about what happens when heads roll and there is a power vacuum in Hollywood. What entity is waiting to fill the void? And what will they do once they take over for good?  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have to tell <em>this sub</em> about the power you&#39;d wield by controlling the propaganda infrastructure that Hollywood provides. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you put just the right amount of info. A brief past history (or at least some useful links) towards scientology shady past, why it fits in the current context, and then your future hypothesis. Fleshing out your theory is important in any of these guessing games. Like I said, I think you may be onto something. Trump&#39;s comments about scientology seem a little too coincidental and &quot;out of nowhere&quot; to not relate to something else going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard this theory on twitter 2 weeks before the Danny Masterson story broke. I thought it was an interesting theory but no Scientologists had been accused yet. Then as soon as Masterson is accused of <strong>violent rape</strong> by four women, Netflix does nothing and the story disappears. </p>
