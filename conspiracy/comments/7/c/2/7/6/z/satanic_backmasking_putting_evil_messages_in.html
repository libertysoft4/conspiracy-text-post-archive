        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Aliester Crowley, aka the Beast 666, came up with this when he was alive. It&#39;s designed to ruin the minds of the children who listen to it. They wanted to push humanity onto Satanism so they used music to do it. </p>

<p>Wikipedia Description:</p>

<p>In the 1973 film The Exorcist, a tape of noises from the possessed victim was discovered to contain a message when the tape was played backwards. This scene might have inspired subsequent copycat musical effects. Although the Satanic backmasking controversy involved mainly classic rock songs, whose authors denied any intent to promote Satanism, backmasking has been used by heavy metal bands to deliberately insert messages in their lyrics or imagery. Bands have utilized Satanic imagery for commercial reasons.[37] For example, thrash metal band Slayer included at the start of the band&#39;s 1985 album Hell Awaits a deep backmasked voice chanting &quot;Join Us&quot; over and over. (About this sound listen).[38] However, Slayer vocalist Tom Araya states that the band&#39;s use of Satanic imagery was &quot;solely for effect&quot;.[39] Cradle of Filth, another band that has employed Satanic imagery, released a song entitled &quot;Dinner at Deviant&#39;s Palace&quot;, consisting almost entirely of unusual sounds and a reversed reading of the Lord&#39;s Prayer[40] (a backwards reading of the Lord&#39;s Prayer is reportedly a major part of the Black Mass).[19][41] Seattle-based grunge band Soundgarden parodied the phenomenon of Satanic backmasking on their 1989 album Ultramega OK. When played backwards, the songs &quot;665&quot; and &quot;667&quot; reveal a song about Santa Claus. Marilyn Manson used this technique. For example, in the beginning of his song &quot;Tourniquet&quot; when played backwards, his voice is heard saying &quot;This is my lowest point of vulnerability&quot; as explained in his book The Long Hard Road Out of Hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first of all, I would never reduce myself to the status of a Luciferian. That&#39;s worst than joining a street gang and I&#39;m not that stupid.</p>

<p>2nd, if Lucifer&#39;s name was &quot;Light-Bringer&quot; before he became a rebel, it would make sense because light refers to goodness, knowledge, and sight. Lucifer&#39;s philosophy post rebellion is &quot;do as thou wilt&quot; which is in itself a VERY broken philosophy because it would cause so much confusion, chaos, and bring in so many enemies. Lucifer thought this was correct so in HIS mind, he is the light-bearer.</p>

<p>Light = Sight, clarity, transparency, a directional guide, knowledge, goodness, and peace.</p>

<p>Darkness = Confusion, evil, and chaos.</p>

<p>That is the big difference between the 2. My name, light bringer, refers to me being a person who brings in transparency into the minds of others so that we can see what the hell is going on in our surroundings. If we can&#39;t see what&#39;s truly happening around us, it means we live in darkness. Hence, the name fits perfectly.</p>

<p>You have to also remember, truth is relative. Just because one word means something in one context doesn&#39;t mean it means something in all other settings. The only way to translate what one sees is to look at the whole picture. In this case, I am speaking out against Satanism so that may suggest that I don&#39;t believe in it which I don&#39;t.</p>

No one called you out on being a &#39;Luciferian&#39;. Although, even if you did practice Luciferianism I don&#39;t really think anyone in this sub is going to have a stroke about. I do, however, appreciate the explanation and insight you lent behind your /u/ name from your point of view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a metalhead, I can assure you that metalheads are basically all just dorks who like horror movies and scary stuff. We are not evil Satan worshippers any more than a horror movie directors are evil. It’s just an aesthetic for people who like heavy music and creepy imagery. We’ve been persecuted by ‘satanic panic’ whack jobs for years and it’s really just religious nuts misunderstanding what metal is really about. Part of the purpose behind these kind of lyrics like Slayer and CoF is to offend hypocritical Jesus freaks who have no problem with the massive amount of violence and gory imagery in the Bible and even hang statues of a bloody crucified corpse everywhere, but freak out that a black metal band plays a prayer in reverse. </p>

<p>If you want to find the genuine Satan worshippers, look at illuminati puppets like Katy Perry. Leave the metalheads alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude “violent media” can be anything these days. With such generic criteria it’s not that card to find some correlation. You made the claim that listening to heavy metal is bad for me, so provide some evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your mind is like a void of probability. You can put anything you want into and it will have a higher chance of appearing in your reality. You might imagine a glass of water when you feel thirsty so you get water. Getting water is your choice but the thought pushes you toward getting water. </p>

<p>When you insert violent ideas into your head, you are greatly increasing the chance of it occurring in real life. Considering heavy metal sounds like the anger emotion, it will increase the probability of you getting angry at other people throughout the day which will eventually disrupt your relationships and possibly burn some bridges.</p>

<p>That’s just one example. Mental poisons come in all shapes and sizes. They hook you in using using “candy”, aka something appealing for you, and they put the poison in the candy so that you eat the candy without realizing there is poison in there. Overtime, you entire mind becomes poisoned.</p>

<p>The only real answer is staying away from MSM. Try it for a few months and you will see how much better you feel. It works for everyone that does it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you basing that on? You mentioned thousands of studies. I’ve been listening to heavy metal for 20+ years and I’ve never had any sort of violent incident. I personally know others who also have no violent tendencies and are obsessed with metal. 
Heavy metal is not MSM so I don’t understand your point. You can’t just group all forms of media together to support your conclusions.</p>

<p>Here is an article on an actual study which demonstrates that listening to heavy metal can actually calm people that are angry. 
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/22/listening-heavy-metal-punk-extreme-music-makes-you-calmer-not-angrier-study">https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/22/listening-heavy-metal-punk-extreme-music-makes-you-calmer-not-angrier-study</a></p>

<p>I can corroborate this with my personal experience. Listening to aggressive or violent music makes me less angry and violent, since it’s a form of stress relief in the same way that punching a bag or squeezing a bag might release anger. I’m surprised you haven’t considered this in your studies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah!  I was simply giving you the answer you were seeking as to why your Reddit handle was being connected to Lucifer in the pervious comment. No one called you out on being a &#39;Luciferian&#39;. Although, even if you did practice Luciferianism I don&#39;t really think anyone in this sub is going to have a stroke about. I do, however, appreciate the explanation and insight you lent behind your /u/ name from your point of view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally. No way its an accident, man. The song is called Lucifer. Again, I think it was producers just trying to get some buzz and acting cool. Dont think its some kind of ritual/dedication to Satan or anything. </p>
