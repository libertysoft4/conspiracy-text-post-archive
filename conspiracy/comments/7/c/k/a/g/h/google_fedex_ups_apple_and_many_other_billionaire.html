        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So let’s put this together. These companies are lucky enough to have the opportunity to provide millions of high paying jobs to their fellow Americans and still remain billionaires. Instead they chose to Outsource jobs to overseas slaves knowing it would increase the unemployment rate and would mean less money in the middle class pool which could eventually trigger a recession. </p>

<p>It is not only dangerously selfish to help destroy the American economy for self profit but it’s also intentional. This is how the NWO works. </p>

<p>Somehow, someway this oligopoly has convinced the rest of us that they rightfully own everything of value. We are told they earned it through years of hard work which is a lie to trick the public into spending a lifetime working as a slave. By the time an old man realizes that he worked like a slave all is life only to still be making $10 an hour, it is too late. He is too old and tired to fight back. His dreams and desires were just a facade. He will probably spend the rest of his years as a grumpy old man who dies a slow and painful death. The cabal knows all this. They also know they bought themselves some time while the masses celebrate an imaginary future of success. </p>

<p>Then people like Soros write out laws to protect this oligopoly and strong arm mobsters like the IRS still bend us over for Lord Rothschilds Mafia taxes. If anyone complains, they just threaten to stop fixing the roads. </p>

<p>After a lifetime of slavery, I finally realized that money is the modern day club. When the cabal wants to keep us in line, they bash us over the head with the modern day club. Also, I realized that all people own everything just like we did when there were only a thousand humans. To use ones own money printing press to print enough money to buy out everything of value in the world is really no different than communism where the oligarchy own and control everything of value. </p>

<p>Google, for example, should not have pedo style MK ultra videos brainwashing our toddlers but we can’t do anything about it because they claim it doesn’t belong to us. Well, 95% of the cabals companies are dirty so everywhere we go we are hit by corporate abuse. </p>

<p>I no longer consent to these rules. These scumbags value a few extra million per year even though it means ruining a country with 300 million in it. I say we take over all of this shit, rearrange it to actually serve society instead of abuse it, and share everything using a caretakership program instead of ownership. The only difference is that when someone isn’t using something anymore, they need to donate it to someone who needs it. We can run the whole show because we already do. The 99% across the world actually runs everything while the 1% make all the shekels. All we have to do is kick the 1% out and cooperate to make all these amazing companies work for our society so it benefits everyone instead of endless enslavement. </p>

<p>Even Zionist Rabbi Finkelstein openly taunted us by saying “Stupid Goy do all the work. We make all the shekels.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. We can have robots without losing anything but we have to restructure the whole economy to make it work. There is nothing wrong if robots take every single job we have as long as the system is changed to accommodate it so that our quality of life greatly improves. I’m not worried about it because I know people will come to their senses as the robots come flooding in. We have no choice but to restructure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good insider I follow named Cobra says that after mass arrests and disclosure, they will release all the secret technology which will make money obsolete. He says the tech is enough to give everyone what they need without issue. He did mention that while the technology is being released, they will take all the money hoarded by bankers and spread it evenly across the whole world to seriously jump start the economy and keep it rolling while the tech spreads. </p>

<p>I can’t guarantee anything but I really trust this insider. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree with the thread and this comment. The corporations will push robots in, already are, and they do it in a smart manner.  I&#39;ve been in a few Amazon warehouses and it&#39;s frightening.  Robots do the real work and the employees do the work of what robots once did (packages picked, sorted, dropped at a position where a human just double checks mindlessly). Robot trucking and shipping will happen in just a couple of years, putting millions out of work- the only work they are trained to do.</p>

<p>However, there will be a tipping point where restructure has to happen or there will be a revolt. I think they will realize restructure will be easier and more cost effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not have robots do the work, and tax the corporations in order to pay everyone a basic income? Any company that can have robots, with the increased efficiency and reduced costs that come along with that, who still employs humans will automatically lose to any company that does employ robots. </p>

<p>In the race to efficiency, it&#39;s clear that robots and software win. Realizing this about a quarter of a century ago, I went back to night school to study systems and networking; part of my job now involves automation. The future has never looked brighter,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What obligation should a company have to a country?
For example, ~25% of iPhone sales are in the United States, 25% come from China and 50% rest of the world.</p>

<p>Why should Apple not manufacture their products overseas ? 
How is that being &quot;greedy&quot; when 3/4 of iphones sold are sold overseas anyways. 
Let me guess you also think that Apple keeping their profits from Overseas sales in accounts overseas is a bad thing?</p>

<p>Finally Apple employs more than 50% of their total employees in the United States alone. 
The United States is an advanced technology based economy, where advanced skills are recognized and rewarded. In economics we call this a Capital Intensive economy.
Other countries such as China are what we call Labor intensive economies, where their labor input has a much higher output towards their GDP . </p>

<p>my questions for you OP are,</p>

<p>A. Why should Apple manufacture iPhones in the United States when they are a global company that has 75% of its sales done outside of the country?</p>

<p>B. Why is it inherently wrong for other countries to benefit from a corporations businesses.  (Ex, Apple creating jobs in China). It is beneficial for Chinese civillians, whose lives are worth just as much as yours and mine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t many other countries make it far less lucrative to outsource through labor and heavy import taxes? </p>

<p>Not saying one way is better than another just asking for a comparison. </p>
</div>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-2" data-depth="2" data-id="dpr6m29">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/iXbrian.html">iXbrian</a> 2017-11-13</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily, especially with all the free trade agreements out there many developed countries have very low import taxes on goods. Consider if Country A put an import tax on Country B&#39;s goods, what would country B do? Put an import tax on Country A&#39;s goods. End result? Country A&#39;s imports go down, but their exports also go down. End result for the economy? Less trade, higher prices.</p>

<p>The only time it makes sense for an import tax is to protect a domestic market in developing countries.</p>

<p>For example if you look at the protectionist measures put on by the South Korean government on the car market,  in the past South Korea put heavy import taxes on cars in order to help the domestic car manufacturers (Hyundai, Kia). Now that they have grown into something huge and the market is fully developed, SK government has lowered import taxes (leading to a high number of imported cars in Korea).</p>

<p>Had the South Korean government not removed the tarriffs, than european countries would not have lowered their tarriffs for korean cars. In order for Hyundai/Kia to be able to sell outside of Korea the government had to lower their import taxes on all cars.</p>

<p>The next problem is the amount of the tax.
Lets say for example (THE NUMBERS ARE SUPER HYPOTHETICAL) China can make an iPhone for $250, and in the United States it would cost $400. 
Apple then sells the iPhone for $500. 
 So in order to bring the manufacturing back to the US , The United States would have to impose an import tax  on imported phones so that it becomes cheaper to manufacture in the US. 
Great so now manufacturing has moved back to the United States. Apple makes less money but everyone in the US is happier now right?
But wait.. what about China? They are PISSED. What should they do? Raise the import tax on phones manufactured in the USA! Or how about Cars? Computers? </p>

<p>What about Apple? They were previously making $250 profit per phone but now they are owning making $100! Now their accounting is fucked up and they have to let people go because they can&#39;t afford so many employees.</p>

<p>Production of iphones starts to go down due to less employees
Apple then has to raise the price of iphones to compensate.</p>

<p>Now mr joe consumer is having to pay $700 for that iphone he bought last year for $500 even though he has a fancy new job making iPhones in Texas! As a result hes still poor like before because everything costs more.</p>

<p>My question is,</p>

<p>who is the winner here? Apple? China? Mr Joe Consumer? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wtf u talking about dude </p>

<p>fedex is a multinatiinal corporation that does 30+% of their business overseas.</p>

<p>There are thousands of courier companies out there but the reason fedex maintains their market share is due to their efficient cost structure. If they used US call center employees(btw this is only for some consumers at certain peak times, businesses usually deal with a us based rep, and it makes sense considering business deljveries are the largest portion of fedexs revenue) , they would have to raise prices across the board which would completely decimate their international market share and other companies with more efficient cost structures would easily run fexex out of business.</p>

<p>Fedex deciding to use foreign call center employees for a small portion of their business is not because they are greedy capitalists, it is because that is the only way they can stay competetive and maintain their market share. Look up Economies of scale, and youll learn how pricing is set and I can bet you fedex is operating at zero-economic profit ny increase in cost of production of their good/service will literally run them out of business</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but there is the whole &quot;self-driving semi truck&quot; phenomenon, which is likely less than 10 years away.</p>

<p>How many big-rig cross-country truck drivers are there now? </p>

<p>How much do they get paid? </p>

<p>What kind of restrictions do they have on their labor? </p>

<p>How does that affect delivery times?</p>

<p>How else does human involvement negatively affect the shipping process?</p>

<p>Any shipping company intending on maximizing profits will roll out these self-driving trucks at the absolute fastest pace possible. The savings of not having to pay salary/benefits are obvious to everyone. The advantage of being able to operate the trucks 24/7 means stuff &quot;gets there&quot; much much sooner and more reliably. The impersonal aspects of a robot driving means that fuel efficiency will constantly be at it&#39;s maximum providing a fair amount of savings.</p>

<p>So, it should be obvious at this point, that this takeover of the shipping industry <em>WILL HAPPEN</em>, it&#39;s just a matter of when.</p>

<p>But that leaves us to ask</p>

<p>What will happen to all the millions (yes, millions) of not-so-educated truckers, who are not really trained to do anything else, and likely cannot realistically be trained to do something drastically different (programming, engineering, nursing, etc...)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard there are a 1000 different version of communism. Why don&#39;t we just let Communism, Socialism, and Capitalism die off so we can use a more noble economics system like Sacred Economics. There&#39;s no point in pointing fingers at small similarities and accusing them of being other things. </p>

<p>As I said before, just because a car is black and a dog is black doesn&#39;t make a car a dog. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree with the thread and this comment. The corporations will push robots in, already are, and they do it in a smart manner.  I&#39;ve been in a few Amazon warehouses and it&#39;s frightening.  Robots do the real work and the employees do the work of what robots once did (packages picked, sorted, dropped at a position where a human just double checks mindlessly). Robot trucking and shipping will happen in just a couple of years, putting millions out of work- the only work they are trained to do.</p>

<p>However, there will be a tipping point where restructure has to happen or there will be a revolt. I think they will realize restructure will be easier and more cost effective.</p>
