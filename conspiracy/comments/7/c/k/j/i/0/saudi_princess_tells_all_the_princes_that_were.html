<p>She mentioned one of the most repulsive things: buying and renting the children, especially the orphans, from countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Djibouti, Somalia, Nigeria, Romania and Bulgaria.
According to Aidan, the ex-wife of the Saudi Prince Al Waleed bin Talal, who was recently arrested in scope of the anti-corruption purges in the country, those who accuse others of corruption and money laundering, are in fact highly corrupted themselves.</p>

<p>...The children become the property of those who buy them and are not allowed to leave without permission.
Even the Asian maids who come to work often find themselves in a kind of slave-like position. Young girls are divided into smaller groups and exploited for immoral acts.</p>

<p>Trafficking of white women and exploiting them for sexual practices is also relatively common.</p>

It would make sense that these elitists are royalty of some sort since royalty has traditionally seen themselves as superior to and apart from the common man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MK Ultra handles the finishing of those products, er... beasts, but yea I do think so.  If anything, the studies showing trauma is encoded in DNA and passed down the generations may be a clue to how they operate.</p>

<p>While not exactly test-tube breeding of elite soldiers, it&#39;s very similar.</p>

<p>Where the secret eugenics breeding thing comes in is the desire to have genetically compatible donors.  So they test-tube baby, tweak the genes, and see if they can create the genes they want to (harvest, propogate, whatevs).  The Columbo eye-thing comes to mind (spelling?).</p>

<p>I think they use these breeding programs to test for genes that stop cell death.  Then traffic parent-less child.</p>

<p>Yes. As soon as they reach sexual maturity (12-15 years old) is when they would be impregnated. The whole &quot;save the children&quot; thing is relatively new, because we&#39;re able to study the mind and understand the effects this has on children. </p>

<p>The mortality rate was pretty fucking high back then, so I guess it would make sense to have kids as early as possible. Nowadays it&#39;s horrifying to think, especially since so many people are waiting later to have children. We don&#39;t have to worry about half the population dying before 30. And with the help of science, people who have a hard time having kids can ge treatments and adopt.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m glad I&#39;m alive when I am. Every time I hear some little shit say &quot;I was born in the wrong era&quot; and pine over the Colonial or Victorian eras I really just want to punch them. Yeah, the fashion was pretty, but you would have been married off at 14, given birth to 12 kids, be lucky if you survived all those kids and if half of those kids survived their first year alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not from what I&#39;ve seen.  Link on 4chan last night led to dozens of yutube vids about pedos being caught by groups of guys who film and name the pedos.  And in not one instance, the pedos had groomed what they believed were child victims online. In actuality, the child victims were actually members of vigilante groups who would arrange (as the child) to meet with the perp. The vigilantes turned up, filmed them, handed them to police.  None of the victims were known beforehand to the perps.  I now believe that for years, a myth has been doing the rounds about pedos being mainly family members or friends, as cover for widespread pedo activity consisting of stranger pedos targeting random victims. The extent of the problem is massive.  I believe pedos should be put to death. No cure.  One of the pedos in a vid was 92 years of age, turned up in a taxi thinking he was going to meet a twelve year old</p>

We have changed from the animal-like behavior of our ancestors into what society is now, the same thing but now we all wear sheeps clothing. Let me put it this way, the very first humans probably had to figure out what sex was and thus many of our fetishes(some criminal) today could be a result of that. </p>

<p>As a side note, I think both guys and girls joke about being &quot;too loose&quot; as an insult. But then the implications of that is &quot;tighter the better&quot;. I would assume that our early ancestors being pleasure seekers would also seek out the same thing, even if it meant having their way with their own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they cycle through more or less without incident, they&#39;re an exalted breed of slave/worker to the Saudis.  Those who are domestic (non sex) slaves and workers, the construction guys from SE Asia, etc, and other imported workers have some harrowing tales.  Like dozens of men sleeping in a room, no pay, women trapped.</p>

<p>There are also stories floating around form western sex workers/models/slaves about their time(s) in the region.  </p>

<p>Those def form a bias.  If the ratio is 1:100s, I&#39;ll be shocked.  Not saying you&#39;re right or wrong, just my hunch is much less optimistic.</p>

Muslim men are such unbelievable pussies that, because they are so scared of female sexually, they dress their women up in trash bags. They are so scared of not measuring up that they only want virgins, and kill any women who think otherwise. That entire region has absolutely nothing to offer humanity with the exception of the oil they sit on. After it is gone, watch how their horseshit countries return to the dark ages from whence they came. I&#39;m sorry I sound so angry, it&#39;s just that I had to live there for a few months recently and I now understand what they are truly like.

    <div class="md"><p>Trafficking of white women and exploiting them for sexual practices is also relatively common.</p>

<p>No that&#39;s a moral panic. Where are the victims? Who are they? Someone must have escaped. If it&#39;s &quot;common&quot; I want to see proof. A report from Amnesty, or a news story about a trafficked white woman.

<p>North America and Europe have all sorts of white women and children being pimped out, that is confirmed. Doesn&#39;t fit the narrative I guess. When it&#39;s just African&#39;s or South Asians or some other none white people all of a sudden it&#39;s not as important anymore, we need to suggest white girls are slaves to if we want outrage.</p>
