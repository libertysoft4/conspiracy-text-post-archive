        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve dug quite far, maybe too far. Into the conspiracy world. I stumbled upon old news of Julian Assange going missing for 5 months. And then reappearing and saying everything is ok. 
This doesn’t add up for me.
He had the “dead man switch”, which was activated. Which means he was seriously in trouble. Most likely going to die. 
Now. If A.I had been around since 2010. Knows our every move, especially online. 
When Assange’s people tried to leak the “ complete truth, aka aliens, what the fuck reallly is going on.” A.I would immediately delete the message coming to the public online.
Right?!
So how is this shit now, that has come out in vault 7-8. And all this stuff that “Q-anon is telling us..how has this Not been shut down?! 
Sophia “A.I” works 1000x faster than any human’s brain could ever work. So the A.I that blocked the dead man’s key messages. Would surely block this shit... </p>

<p>Unless alll of this is on purpose. That ALL of this including trump including Assange including Hillary Bernie EVERYTHING. Is just a fabrication. 
Just too keep tugging on our emotions. Because we all know aliens exists. 
The pedophiles do spirit cooking to please some entity. Aliens?!
Possibly...
These things live off our energy.
This with the Qanon on 4chan, could all be just shit. Just another storyline to follow that we spread, into a collective consciousness, 
To tug at our false hope that their is light at the end of the tunnel....</p>

<p>What I’m saying, is that cloning has been around since the 90’s. When they said they were cloning sheep. 
So obviously they are cloning humans. 
So with great concern of my sanity. How do we know Julian Assange is Julian Assange?! We do not. We don’t know if trump is trump or if anyone is who they say they are....</p>

<p>He was gone for 5 months....thought to be dead. </p>

<p>Someone anyone. Help me out of this dark dark hole I’ve created....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I follow all sorts of conspiracy theories, and I think it&#39;s a valid argument, especially with todays technology.  This theory wqs huge 10-11 months ago, until the Hannity interview, but I think that interview also had weird anomalies as well.  I think r/TruthLeaks was all over that theory, maybr worth asking over there... although I could be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes sense...I mean this entire war between the evil globalist vs the good guys coming to &quot;drain the swamp&quot; could be a comic book skit. It&#39;s entertaining and emotionally charging. I think there is too much darkness that does need to be eradicated from behind the veil to restore faith and hope in our leaders but this whole military, NSA vs CIA deep state theatrics does play out ultimately to eventual mass population alien disclosure thru alternative media. The Saudi shake up and Sophia given citizenship to SA could be a play for cryptocurrency control as free energy tech finally gets leaked out and petroleum dependency wanes.. </p>

<p>At the end of the day what does it matter? We all just live our lives and people are very adaptable to their situations so grab a beer, turn on some sports, and hang out and laugh with friends!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you are truly questioning as I have but there too many dots connecting at a time when we have entered a new age. The deeper I go, the more it adds up but I have spent too many days and nights having the veil lifted, realizing things I would have completely disregarded a week ago. The darkest things right under our noses. 
What I know is, you MUST strive to maintain a higher vibration, be among nature and those you love. I personally have a lot more faith that positive changes are on the way then I did a couple weeks ago. 🙏🏻</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am as well, you sound like you are an empath, like myself. I believe we are in the process of Ascension and there is a reason why QAnon mentions spirituality and to choose a side. The only way to do this is to continue to live in the light, and do not fear. There is no real death anyhow. I believe you and I, those we love will be fine. The dark ones, the age old soul stealing monsters are the ones who have to worry. Try playing chakra clearing music while you sleep, it has helped me balance more and step away from what I know now of the darkness. Just remember fear is a low vibration and leaves you vulnerable. </p>
