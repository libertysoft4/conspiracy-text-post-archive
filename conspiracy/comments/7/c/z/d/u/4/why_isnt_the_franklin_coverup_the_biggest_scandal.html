        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For people unaware of the cover-up:</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an excellent video to start. It is very dark, and involves child sex trafficking and blackmail. It implicates the highest levels of politicians, including George H.W. Bush.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b61iIQCapY&amp;amp;t=62s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b61iIQCapY&amp;amp;t=62s</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s Paul Bonacci (who claims he was prostituted for high level politicians in DC) giving his statement. Personally, I believe him. Bonacci was able to accurately describe rooms and arrangements inside the Whitehouse that weren&#39;t publicly available.
If you&#39;ve heard of Johnny Gosch (the boy that went missing in 1982), Bonacci claims he met him whilst inside the prostitution ring.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW2U5L17lDQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW2U5L17lDQ</a></p>

<p>LA FBI Chief Ted Gunderson&#39;s speech on the cover up:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST1zqhCqHW4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST1zqhCqHW4</a></p>

<p>Investigators, including CIA Director William Colby were allegedly killed for digging to deep. Some investigators were literally blown up, never seen again. Some children testifying were killed as well.</p>

<p>Either way you look at this scandal, children were abused, evidence was covered up, and people were killed.</p>

Gary Caradori, the respected investigator, was about to blow the case wide open and he was murdered.  There is documented testimony from numerous children about the abuses they suffered and the planes they were flown on.  Multiple kids specifically said Larry King was involved.  There is wayyy more testimony out there than just Paul Bonacci&#39;s testimony.  Nick Bryant has a great book on the topic with lots of sources printed in full in the back as evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is entirely wrong. There are various sources supporting the same story- even arrests related to people surrounding the story. And what should convince any unbiased person looking into this is all the mysterious deaths of investigators/journalists/law enforcement people that were digging into it.</p>

<p>Assuming you&#39;re not here for the sole purpose of discrediting this story- look up the &quot;finders&quot; article in DC- Washington post 1992 I believe. They reported that D.C. Police raided a warehouse w computers/CP/sets for taking pics/receipts of international transactions. They were called to the warehouse because people called police saying they saw children being carried out of the building to vans. They had two articles on it then a follow up explaining that the three letter organizations took over the investigation. No word about it after that. I&#39;ll see if I can find the article and add it to this comment. Since then a bunch of sources backed this story</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the trial was obvious bullshit.  There was never anything to explain why these children needed to be flown repeatedly  by private plane from Nebraska to DC.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the state senator in charge of the investigation after the two deaths related to the case:</p>

<p>Lawrence Schmit quickly issued a report denouncing the grand jury’s conclusion. Despite his objections, two months after his report was issued, the committee was shut down. According to Schmit,</p>

<p>“The message was not lost on most politicians in Nebraska. I think the message that was delivered was if any committee every tries to conduct a thorough investigation again, this same thing will happen… It has shaken my faith in the institutions of government.”</p>

<p>So what is the innocent explanation for flying all those kids back and forth to DC?  Obviously if this was an elaborate hoax, good enough to convince a fair number of people, King would have mentioned the real reason for ferrying foster kids to DC on private planes.</p>

Also its one of those things that challenges everyones belief system, and most people do not want to have their belief systems challenged.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the mind finds this scandal so horrible that its hard for people to consider or imagine.</p>

<p>Personally i believe aliens working with our government is highly likely... I believe 911 was a lie and the towers were demolished with explosives....</p>

<p>But when i first watched Conspiracy of Silence and looked into The Finders, i started becoming horrified and even scared for my families safety... CIA running a pedo operation for high level people and then covering the whole thing up, really helped me realize how there is going to be no truths coming from our government and that the USA along with most other countries were deeply controlled by CIA and others and how fucked up the situation really is.</p>

<p>Tldr: the finders scared me enough to stop researching into it, not even Dulce base scares me to the extent of a secretive organization (cia) controls the USA </p>

<p>Did you read Paul Bonnaci&#39;s testimony or see his interviews?</p>

<p>What made your friend uncomfortable?</p>

<p>What kind of stuff did he say to you?</p>

<p>Did people eventually confront him about his past? </p>

<p>I saw a voat thread that had some church flyer and he was some choir leader or some shit. They were confronted about him and the removed him from the flyer. Or something like that. Was he involved in a church that you know of? </p>

<p>PM me with some info on his whereabouts if you feel comfortable. There are Patriots in Virginia that have no love for chomos and could possibly serve justice no.matyer how late it may be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just from personal experience, when people are confronted with a shocking discovery, like child abuse, they often just refuse to accept it.  They are unreasonable and even focus their anger on the victims.  People just want to be comfortable.  The best way to make it ok for people to accept the idea that somebody did something terrible is to first denigrate or demonize the perpetrator in some cartoonish way.  Then it&#39;s ok to fort people to attribute horrible actions to them, and they will even do so enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Also, it involved one of the most powerful and intimidating political families in US history.  </p>
