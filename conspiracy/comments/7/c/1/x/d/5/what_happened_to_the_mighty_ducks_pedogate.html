    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, considering how big a deal their removal from the mod team was, there was surprisingly little resistance from members here. The whole scandal reeked of a hostile takeover, and anyone who dared question the underlying motives was met with twisted accounts of SC and FT themselves trying to take over the sub. Come to think of it, there are a lot of parallels between that incident and the whole Russian interference issue. A common control tactic where you accuse your opponents of doing the very same thing you have done or are trying to do. We all knew this sub was destined to be infiltrated and taken over by shills at one point or another, and imo the removal of SC and FT was the biggest step in that direction that we&#39;ve seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sarah Connor removed all the other mods because he believed they were planning a hostile takeover, no? As I recall the other mods had viewed some of SC&#39;s actions as inappropriate, and so a vote was called to remove SC as the top mod of the sub and demote him to the bottom mod position. SC apparently said he would honor the results of said vote, but at the last minute banned the other mods because he realized a coup was afoot. Reddit admins stepped in to reinstate the removed mods and revoke most of SC&#39;s mod privileges, which I believe was an unprecedented move, and soon afterwards SC and Flytape were kicked from the mod team.</p>

<p>A few red flags stuck out in this whole debacle:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The community was given no information or input about any of this until after the fact. It should be a top priority to be as transparent as possible about mod shakeups in this sub.</p></li>
<li><p>Any time a top mod is removed there needs to be a damn good reason, and from what I read, the reasoning basically amounted to SC deleting a few comments that shouldn&#39;t have been deleted.</p></li>
<li><p>Reddit admins were directly involved, which practically never happens. It&#39;s also well known in r/conspriacy that the admins are untrustworthy and are fully willing to sell out to the highest bidder.</p></li>
<li><p>SC and Flytape were, to my knowledge, the only openly pro-Trump mods on the sub. Now all the mods are more or less on the same side politically.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Feel free to counter anything I&#39;ve said or add your own perspective. As another user expressed below, I too have you rated as green in RES and I have nothing personally against you, but in this day and age trust needs to be earned, not given freely. Especially on this sub. Too many interests desire for us to know only half truths.</p>

<p>If they posted a link in a self post and put in some effort, they wouldn&#39;t get removed. But shitposts don&#39;t belong here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=reddit+NSA+canary">https://www.google.com/search?q=reddit+NSA+canary</a></p>

<p>There is a difference between a company that is trying to make money and a company that is making money by being given taxpayer dollars to let the government do whatever it wants.</p>

<p>At some point in every popular website&#39;s life it gets big enough to get a national security letter that results in control being given to the government. You should be posting on websites that aren&#39;t big enough yet to justify the government tipping its &quot;secret spooky demand letter&quot; hand. There are a lot of other smaller sites out there where lively unmolested conversation is taking place. Its not 4chan, its not Reddit, its the others.</p>

You can say &quot;no hardcore evidence, where is the proof?&quot; but the proof may never come. We have to start looking at things like this and realizing that this stuff is <em>NOT</em> something that people will tolerate being openly talked about and discussed. Which is crazy now that all of these pedophiles are getting busted. Pizzagate/Pedogate is becoming more and more real.

    <div class="md"><p>Pedogate is not a conspiracy. Pedogate is the ugly cousin that was adopted because Pizzagate is leading nowhere. Pedogate is the idea that Pedos exist in high power places. </p>

<p>PsychologyToday states that 1-in-5 children have been molested. That means pedophilia is pretty damn common. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong - that is fucking disgusting and it sucks and I want to take them all down.</p>

<p>But why do we assume that people in high power positions would NOT mimic the statistics of the public? If pedophilia is prevalent in the general population, wouldn&#39;t that apply to the important people too?</p>

<p>As such, Pedogate is another term for &#39;common sense&#39;. Don&#39;t group Pizzagate and Pedogate together because they are EXTREMELY different. One is based on assumed code-words. The other is based on scientific reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no problem guy, sorry i don&#39;t compile all of my thoughts on high-power conspiracies on one account. seems like anyone with half a brain and a true belief that the government is corrupt would follow the same easy security measures.</p>

<p>it may be easy to be tracked in the end of the day, but every step taken to make it harder is a success in my book.</p>

<p>Zoom in on that circular white light. You see those designs? Those are the designs.</p>

<p>So, according to Pizzagate, the Bahamas and its airport is run by sick pedos connected to Podesta and Clinton and Soros or something?</p>
