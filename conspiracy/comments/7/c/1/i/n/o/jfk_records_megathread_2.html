<p>If the files have not been re-reviewed yet by either the specific agencies (such as the CIA, FBI, and NSA) or the National Archives themselves, then one wonders why they would release them now in their present redacted form. It’s Alice in Wonderland time.</p>

<p>Haha fuckers. For these pages to be fully redacted in 2017 means only one thing. The CIA has still got something to hide about Oswald.</p>

<p>Most likely conclusion is that he was closely associated with them, if not an outright employee. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you link that because I haven&#39;t seen Bernie feeding into the Russia thing at all.  I mean he&#39;s going to take shots at Trump for anything possible so I imagine he&#39;s probably touched on it when he&#39;s questioned but he&#39;s not railing on it like typical dems.  He is quietly putting pieces in place for a big change in the democratic party.  The more he plays along with Democrats for now the more sway he will hold.  There is still a Liberal base in the democratic party that wants to stick with Dem&#39;s it&#39;s important for Bernie to not rock that boat atm.  He made the contrast between corporate dems and progressives during the primary but kicking the party while it&#39;s down would not do him any favors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah like I said.  He was asked about it and he says &quot;I think the evidence is overwhelming and all the agencies are in agreement.&quot;  He really has no basis to disagree, even if he has his doubts.  He would risk being labeled a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; and really stands to gain nothing.  Whether Russia had anything to do with it or not, it&#39;s going to be &quot;proven&quot; that they did.  Anyone arguing against it or even showing hesitation on it is going to be discredited.  </p>

<p>Bernie does not have time or energy to waste dying on every hill.  He&#39;s picking his battles and he&#39;s playing ball at times.  Going against the Russia investigation would be very high risk and very low reward.</p>

<p>It would be like a politician being asked who they thought did 9/11 and them saying well I&#39;m not to sure...  Even though most people would agree with them they would be done for.  There is more to politics than making people happy.  Remember elections only happen every couple years, in the mean time the people elected are wielding the power.</p>

<p>I would say expect the fired up Bernie to strike again during mid terms and then probably gear up for either another run or backing someone else to run.</p>

<p>CIA was aware of Oswald as early as 1960. They had a 201 file on Oswald originating Dec of 1960. </p>

<p>201 files are created for person&#39;s of interest. Here is a document detailing exactly what a 201 file is <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/104-10051-10170.pdf">https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/104-10051-10170.pdf</a></p>

<p>Go to page 6 of the PDF, the start of bullet point D, and continues to page 7 of PDF. </p>

<p>States that Oswald attempted to assassinate retired General Walker in September of 1963 in Dallas.</p>

<p>Document continues on citing conversations with a Delgado, who was in the Marines with Oswald during training. He states that Oswald was in contact with Cuban embassy while in Marines, and Delgado gave him the idea to contact the Cubans. Delgado continues on that Oswald rarely received mail, but after confiding in Delgado that he contacted the Cubans, he started receiving mail with a seal in latin that he couldn&#39;t make out what country was from but was governmental. Assumed it was Cuba. Also states that a civilian man arrived at their base requesting Oswald, and that this man and Oswald met for an hour and thirty minutes to two hours. Delgado assumes the man was from the Cuban consulate in Los Angeles. CIA report agrees with assertion and can&#39;t identify the man. </p>

<p>Page 22 of the PDF, bullet point 31 and 32 goes into detail of a Ms. Garro&#39;s recollection of seeing Oswald at a Cuban party in Mexico. States that Oswald had a mistress while down there of the name Silvia Duran(who was married at the time?). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it me or am I interpreting it wrong, Cuba/Russia assassinate Kennedy, the CIA/FBI fucked up and let it happen. Rather than pursue justice  (i.e WW3) they swept it under the rug and let the military help, in doing so keeping them in business for the next 60 years by keeping a senate that is pro military. Eisenhower had it all right. This potentially is explosive to whats going on in the world right now, we need to put the wrongs right. The truth must out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that it wasn&#39;t the Russians nor the Cubans. I don&#39;t have the link to the files to  but on the askreddit thread about the jfk files I you can find them in one of the top comments. Apparently, Castro told Cuban officials that is was not him, and the Russians freaked out when Kennedy died because they thought that it was a way for the US to justify an attack towards them. Also, the Russians had pretty good relations with Kennedy (even after then missiles crisis), so they didn&#39;t have any reason to kill him.</p>

<p>The intelligence agencies were watching Oswald because they needed a patsy. A fall guy. They set him up to look like the shooter and he was unaware of the entire plot. </p>

<p>The intelligence agencies, specifically the CIA, were working him as an off the books agent and set him up to take the fall. Hell, he may have even been tasked with shooting Kennedy but before he could others did, which shocked him and so he ran and hid. No one believed him during the interrogation, which wasn&#39;t recorded.</p>
