<p><a href="https://youtu.be/omHKT9sqs48">https://youtu.be/omHKT9sqs48</a></p>

<p>Now, theres a whole SLEW of legitimate questions she COULD have asked him, but instead he got a softball interview and was portrayed as a &quot;victim of fake news&quot;..</p>

<p>Why was there no representation of our side of the story? </p>

<p>&quot;Your critics say that once they revealed an FBI pedophile symbol on one of your businesses&#39; logos, it was changed the next
Day. Why do you suspect this was?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Self described investigators have noted that there is an astonishing amount of strange lude sexual and &quot;ritualistic&quot; art in your supposedly family friendly resturaunt. Care to comment?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is your relationship with John Podesta? Your pizza place is referenced in his leaked emails a dozen or so times. Also, why have you visited the White House 4 times during the 2nd term of the Obama presidency?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why does GQ magazine list you as one of the most powerful people in Washington DC? Do you have any other financial ventures other than your pizza place? You seem to be rubbing elbows with some power DC politicians and elites, James. Can you clear this up for us?&quot;</p>

<p>But instead we get a softball interview from two sociopaths to help clear this cocksucker of any guilt or wrongdoing...</p>

<p>Then he goes and threatens to kill the researcher who exposed the location his &quot;Pegasus Museum&quot;  kill room. </p>

<p>Sure, he&#39;s not hiding <em>anything</em>....</p>

<p>The fact that you think that the logo was at one of Alefantis&#39;s businesses just goes to show how you&#39;ve been duped. It was at Besta Pizza, which has no relationship to Alefantis other than being on the same street.</p>

<p>Of course people just moved on from that, because Besta is not owned by someone connected to </p>

<p>You might want to go back and find out which things were actually at the restaurant and which things were on Instagram. Most of the sexual imagery on Instagram wasn&#39;t even on Alefantis&#39; account, either.</p>

<p>Can you go back and count them again and tell us what the &quot;astonishing amount&quot; is?</p>

<p>His relationship to Democrats is the reason he was attacked! What exactly is there to &quot;clear up&quot;? There&#39;s nothing wrong with him holding fundraisers at his restaurants. </p>

<p>He was on the GQ list because he was David Brock&#39;s boyfriend.</p>

<p>If some artist would make distasteful jokes about pedophilia in my establishment, I would distance myself from that and I would let the world know that all ties have been severed with this band.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dog would&#39;ve carried out a better interview. Kelly had directions to picture Alefantis as a victim, so the questions she chose were in his favour. Also the interview was obviously rehersed, so he was never put on the spot or asked any awkward questions that he wouldnt know how to answer.</p>

<p>Bet she got an invite to jimmy&#39;s private pizza afterparty </p>

<p>You really expect the media to write about the hanky code and references to pizza? Maybe they thought their viewers weren&#39;t morons? He was a victim of fake news and a weaponized conspiracy theory </p>

<p>Because there is no substance to &quot;your&quot; side of the story.</p>

<p>You&#39;re alleging that someone is a pedophile soly on the basis that you managed to misinterpret people talking about food, to pedophilic code words. </p>

<p>There is literally no evidence of anything that you have alleged. None. </p>
