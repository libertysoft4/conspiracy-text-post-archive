    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve gotten away with calling out people a few times so far. I always provide evidence, avoid immature behavior (i.e. name calling), and limit my own political opinions/speculations to comment discussions after the initial callout. I find that removing politics from it makes it so that I have few emotions attached to it and therefore don&#39;t feel the need to get defensive. </p>

<p>My experience with calling people out is that <em>those</em> users themselves rarely say anything to me, because they often don&#39;t comment organically anyways, though sometimes they delete their posts and/or go dormant. </p>

<p>The callout <em>does</em> seem to attract very hostile, defensive, and partisan users though. They seem to get very emotional, call <em>me</em> the shill for collecting evidence, then they make a broad claim completely lacking in evidence and call me an loser for trying, lol. It&#39;s pretty funny because I don&#39;t think they realize all they are doing is shining a light on how partisan and emotional they come off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While there are probably shills amongst those people you&#39;re describing we really don&#39;t know for sure without other proof. Some people might actually just hold those opinions. </p>

<p>Additionally, plenty of people get around rule 10. In fact it&#39;s fun to track those comments then see which mods even do anything about them. </p>

<p>Here is a short list of ways I&#39;ve seen users in the past week <em>subtly</em> get around rule 10:<br/>
&quot;Back up! calling in backup!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Thanks for the record <em>correction</em>&quot;<br/>
&quot;Thank you for sharing the record&quot;<br/>
&quot;Shill&quot;<br/>
and my favorite, &quot;Spill&quot;  </p>

<p>Additionally, why are the mods &quot;split&quot; on the issue of networks of users copying and pasting content (posts and comments) from other places. That behavior and the regular link submission karma farming that happens is real shill-ish behavior and there seems to be nothing to be done about it as when the mods do anything, they get accused of being shills themselves. I can&#39;t begin to imagine the immature, shit flinging they have to sift through daily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of supposed &quot;shills&quot; are just children/young adults who get a big rush out of coming here and reaffirming that they are logical and that conspiracy believers of any kind are not.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t really stop them, they&#39;re going to feel awesome for posting condescending stuff and since there are so many of them they get a ton of validation from each other.</p>

<p>There are also people who feel like they&#39;re helping fight Schizophrenia by just shitting on anything on this sub. I have a badly delusional friend who is basically addicted to &quot;X product will give you cancer&quot; conspiracies. </p>

<p>Sometimes I see a thread title on <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> and I think &quot;That is non-sense to any sane person but, shit if my friend read that it he would believe it instantly&quot;. It makes me want to speak against like, &quot;crazy shit&quot; on this sub.</p>

<p>I see those videos linked here sometimes titled like &quot;DEMONS DEMOCRATS, THE NUMBER 11, OCTOBER 5TH PREPARE YOURSELF&quot; and I just wish there was some moderation about shit that clearly agitates schizophrenia and offers no valuable information to anyone who doesn&#39;t have a psychiatric disorder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. I&#39;m constantly seeing people complain about &quot;shills&quot; here. In fact, bitching &amp; moaning about other people and their shill-worthy status really muddies up the focus of a lot of otherwise decent discussions on r/conspiracy, to the point of ridiculousness sometimes.</p>

<p>The best thing to do, in my opinion, is IGNORE them, and/or, BLOCK them so you don&#39;t have to see their posts and get distracted. Report them if you must, but, geez, don&#39;t contribute to the their static by trying to have any kind of discussion with them. Shills or Trolls, you&#39;re not going to change them, you don&#39;t have the power to ban them (unless you&#39;re a mod), and by engaging with them, you&#39;re falling into their trap. Rise above and just IGNORE/BLOCK/REPORT.  Done, done and done.  Move on.</p>

<p>If you must make some kind of point, then reply to their shilly post with &quot;Blocked.&quot; And then do so.</p>
