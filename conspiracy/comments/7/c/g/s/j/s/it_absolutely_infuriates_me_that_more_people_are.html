    <div class="md"><p>I like to think of it this way. Eyes in space are an invaluable asset. Spy satellites that can travel in low orbit and scope whatever the country wants to are most likely used by any nation with a space program. We have no idea what extent of surveillance they have and I&#39;d guess that information like what type of satellite or when it passes over a certain part of the planet is absolutely important to keep under wraps. Limiting footage that could betray that information would make sense, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you expect to see from that perspective if it were to dock? The camera is either looking at the ground which would be the best view for a launch or it&#39;s looking forward so you see the approach to the space station. You can&#39;t have both.</p>

<p>Also it takes time for the rocket to get properly positioned for docking. The orbit of the space station is fixed and the launch pad is also fixed. They have to launch the rocket and maneuver it into the proper orbit and speed to make the rendezvous. That can take many hours and perhaps days. Are you going to sit and watch the whole thing? Most people would not and therefore that&#39;s why what you want isn&#39;t available. </p>

<p>That is silly, of course I won&#39;t. But it would be interesting to have the footage for so many reasons. People&#39;s general interest shouldn&#39;t be an argument <em>against</em> doing proper video documentation that would be beneficial on so many levels!</p>
