        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>Why, while selling the drugs agenda, the illuminati use the trick of comparing marijuana with alcohol</h1>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>
The same illuminati who falsely accuse the champions of natural sports of doping to &quot;enhance&quot; performance, one of the reasons being the marketing of &quot;drugs are good for you&quot; ... (1)<br/>
... the drugs they use in their own words (2) as &quot;kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies&quot; to control the human cattle, in particular marijuana to mutate teenagers into human cattle.<br/>
A &quot;kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies&quot; only until illuminati overtime (3). But now REAL CCs are a MUST (4).    </p>

<p>Reminder:<br/>
the BIG BANG means the official proclamation of Global Slavery, a world where there&#39;s no place for human cattle on drugs.</p>

<p><strong>While selling the drugs agenda, the illuminati use the trick of comparing marijuana with alcohol.</strong><br/>
This is used either as part of acceptance by association or even to invert reality, i.e.:<br/>
- marijuana produces peaceful consumers;<br/>
- alcohol kills and induces violence.</p>

<p>Depending on addiction effects, you can classify natural drugs in two types, based on whether addiction depends on quantity (A) or not (B), where quantity is independent from the number of times required before addiction begins (this number go to 0 to n, depending on the drug and the individual).  </p>

<p>Marijuana is a drug of Type A, while natural wine is of Type B.  </p>

<p>If you are still confused because you don&#39;t know what side of the line addiction lies, that is because you probably don&#39;t know what inverting reality means. Look for that line here:<br/>
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22obscuring+and+inverting+the+line">https://www.google.com/search?q=&quot;obscuring+and+inverting+the+line</a>&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Talk of which side of the line addiction lies:</strong><br/>
Addiction is a negative side effect of drugs, i.e. BAD.<br/>
Any natural drug which ends in addiction is type BAD, from marijuana to heroin.<br/>
As victims of the BIG LIE, of course it will be hard to admit it. Why?<br/>
Because the longer and more you smoked, the harder it is to admit you were FOOLED into accepting marijuana and drugs as GOOD. </p>

<p><strong><em>Notes</em></strong><br/>
(1) Doping conspiracy was echoed by NOBODY ever since it was exposed in the web, 1999:<br/>
&quot;Doping improves performance in running and jumping&quot; is a lie sold by the illuminati through false accusations to the champions of natural sports.<br/>
Goals include:<br/>
- Marketing the chemical industry, the agenda of increased use of drugs, or in other words fulfilling the illuminati religion&#39;s &quot;Black is White&quot;;<br/>
- Discourage youth to get into athletics, destroying the principle of &quot;healthy mind in healthy body&quot;, required to totally brainwash youth;<br/>
- Stage justice, again with the illuminati religion&#39;s &quot;Black is White&quot;: the biggest deceivers in human history (illuminati, &quot;black&quot;) combat fraud (justice, &quot;white&quot;);<br/>
- Divert attention from the fact that humans reached the physical limits, part of various agendas, starting with &quot;theory of evolution&quot; (hoax created by illuminati).<br/>

<p>(2) In the illuminati&#39;s own words:<br/>
&quot;<em>There will be, in the next generation or so, methods of making people love their servitude, and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies, so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them, but will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by DRUGS. And this seems to be the final revolution.</em>&quot;  -Aldous Huxley, Tavistock Group, California Medical School, 1961  </p>

<p>The article&#39;s style in one word: CONCISE.<br/>
The best writers use the least words possible to convey the most meaning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>without any logical thread 
The article is simple to understand.<br/>
It&#39;s formatted into 3 sections (not including Notes or BASICS sections) that are relevant to the article&#39;s topic.<br/>
Each section contains only a few lines. </p>

<p>connected argument</p>

<p>The article presents an obvious argument which is supported by logical evidence.<br/>
If you disagree, start by refuting (with evidence based on facts) any of the few lines in the article.</p>
