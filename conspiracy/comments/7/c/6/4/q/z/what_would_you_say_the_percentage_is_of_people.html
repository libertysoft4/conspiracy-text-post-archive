    <div class="md"><p>No conspiracy, it&#39;s more like a jumbled mess of perspectives. The entire F&amp;F case is one of a whole bunch of legal stuff going on that depending on your own view point is both right and wrong all at the same time. Each step along the way if one steps back and looks at that section only it tends to always be this gray area where it&#39;s legal but in hindsight is wrong. </p>

<p>Like even the Demand Letter 3 issue is one of perspective. It&#39;s doesn&#39;t really mater if the gun stores in question would voluntarily avoid a certain amount of long gun sales to certain people. The fact that it was legal for them to sell a whole bunch of long guns with out any tracking info etc in the first place would make some go &quot;ya know, we really need Demand Letter 3&quot;. </p>

<p>On the surface that looks like a set up but the dealers were being asked to do something that at the time was 100% legal anyways. Well legal if you don&#39;t know the buyers are strawmen but that too is a hindsight sort of issue. Dealers thought gun buyers might be strawmen buyers, but that&#39;s not the same as 100% knowing. The ATF was correct in thinking that if they cracked down on the strawman buying from Dealer A, the buyers would just move on to Dealer B. At least if they kept buying from Dealer A there was a chance to track the guns. </p>

<p>The entire case blew up being the border agent was killed but that could of happened with or without ATF etc trying to track the guns. There were given an opportunity to try to make something happen, it just failed. F&amp;F is just this very rare case where both side of a given political issue can use the exact same case to extract a pound of flesh from each other. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a conspiracy as much as it was a target of opportunity that was fumbled by a less than stellar plan. The conspiracy part comes after the entire case blew apart as clearly ATF and others looked to just sort of stall out on information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s still not a conspiracy. Looking to regulate bulk sale of long guns to some degree in certain states with little to no regulations to their sale could have happened with or with out F&amp;F. The only conspiracy side to F&amp;F is the stalling of info after the border agent was killed. F&amp;F was a poorly ran operation given the nature of the product at play being guns, yet the operation was not a conspiracy. </p>

<p>You could run the exact same sort of operation for cigarette sales, lets call it Too Smoky. Walk the steps. Guy shows up with bag of cash and a uhaul truck to bulk buy cigs. Dealer think it&#39;s an out of state strawman for resale to avoid taxes and goes to ATF. ATF says they can see it&#39;s a strawman but oks the sales anyway so they can at least track the cigs. Being if they clamp down on the sale, the buyer just moves on to some place else to buy. Being technically his bulk buy is not illegal unless someone knows it&#39;s a strawman looking to move the cigs out of state for resale and there is no way for a dealer to really know that, only suspect. Suspecting is not the same as knowing.  So those sales are legal. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the ATF watches, finally getting a peek into just how much volume is being moved with bulk cigarette buys. So they start to think &quot;Ya know, maybe we should regulate bulk cigarette sales a bit more&quot;. Now are they going to use the data from operation Too Smoky? Sure, being they have that data but did they put the entire chain of events into play conspiracy style looking to clamp down later? No, all they did was tell a dealer to keep doing what he was doing. </p>

<p>The problem with F&amp;F is that it was guns, not cigarettes. It really doesn&#39;t mater if you lose track of few truck loads of cigs. It REALLY maters when it&#39;s guns. Yet I would argue that had the border agent not died F&amp;F at least info gathering wise showed an issue with unregulated long gun sales in bulk. Something that I&#39;m sure is still going on in those same states.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are people convicted of conspiracy to commit certain crimes, that&#39;s different than what people mean by &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. Conspiracy to commit is just a legal way to catch/punish someone in an almost pre-crime like way, while in the planning stages. </p>

<p>I tend to think people believe in big conspiracy theories that revolve around a blind eye, cover ups after the fact and anything that involves holding on to money, power or avoiding jail. The bulk of conspiracy theories that come to light and are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, like really proven not just people shouting it&#39;s been proven tend to be of this nature. </p>

<p>People, most people, don&#39;t tend to believe black bag, kill you off, government is out to kill/enslave/control/gang stalking of everyone sort of conspiracy theories.  The proactive strike first sort of theories that might require larger scale logistics, tons of people in on it but no one ever says anything or gets caught.</p>

<p>Then finally you have the stuff people openly mock. Lets be nice and call them the more speculative sort of conspiracy theories. Tunnels under walmart leading to NWO detainment camps. Global warming is lizard people looking to slowly terraform earth. Stuff like flat earth and that NASA never went to the moon. </p>

<p>I tend to think a majority of people enjoy a good conspiracy theory as a story and how it&#39;s crafted more than they totally believed the story as a fact. Conspiracy theories are modern urban legends for the information world we live in now. A grain of truth as the seed, then a health mix of opinions, more truths and some errors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m genuinely interested in conspiracy theories, and I think people who constantly make fun of them are too. TopMindsofReddit kind of people have to seek out conspiracy theories and theorists, and you can’t read this stuff without being affected. Maybe it’s just me? </p>

<p>I think things like the Panama and Paradise Papers are real conspiracies, and COINTELPRO, and mass surveillance I kinda took it for granted before the Snowden thing (I was surprised that other people were surprised, weird?) and while I don’t believe things like Flat Earth or Reptilians or North American Union, I know that the community has value.</p>

<p>I think top minds are just more involved with the status quo, but they do have an interest in conspiracies, but are afraid of being misled and not ready to have their world turned upside down.</p>

<p>In comparison I think a lot of Conspiracy Theorists are too quick to believe things that are in line with preconceived notions as well as wanting to feel in the know.</p>

<p>I try to balance it, my interest in the theories and my skepticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about that as well. As someone who was part of a sub to combat them I was interested to see what makes the mind of the average sheep tick. As suspected it was a lot of irony and hypocrisy and lack of awareness about the bigger picture.</p>

<p>It&#39;s much like a bunch of people sitting at the edge of the deep end and afraid to get wet, let alone jump into the dark waters .  So they I stead like to be Into the conspiracy of there even being a conspiracy, and to approach it from what is socially acceptable. It&#39;s like training wheels for this sub.  Though they have a ton more Indoctrination they have to address to before making the leap.  So it comes down to curios sheep who are more in denial than c.t. about government.  Government means mind control. Top Minds find comfort in that still.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Naturally. Eventually they get sucked into this vortex. The Donald already has succumbed to the conspiracy forces. Top minds are grooming anarchists as we speak and don&#39;t even realize it. The plan is going perfectly. </p>

<p>For top minds the realization that they are part of a group purposely keeping them dumb is a hard experience for a dumb person to make. It not only takes a leap Into conspiracy, but into critical thinking.  Or at least thinking, period.  Tell that to a group whose mods are tagged as &#39;thought police.&#39;</p>

<p>But even Hollywood now is too obvious for the dumb minds of reddit to fail to comprehend, even though they still do a little .. at this point in time, they will eventually. They too will come Into.  Any who challenge will be absorbed. Even some shills have quit their jobs. Soros is losing members of the new world order , daily.</p>

<p>But if my comment goes against the “everything is a conspiracy theory” narrative then I guess I’d be included in your count</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen people use this phrase in hyperbolic fashion, but I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever seen a literal case of this.  Can you link to an example?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just for instance there were a ton of posts on this sub after the Texas church shooting screaming “false flag”, only a few hours after it happened. It just seems that this sub believes everything that fits their narrative instead of questioning everything regardless of their personal beliefs  </p>

<p>I would think all mainstream media pays attention to subs like this because there is good clickbait material.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, what he said. Some people genuinely believe every single terrorist attack is faked by actors. I’m open to the possibility that some attack somewhere may have been staged, although I don’t know which.
So to the people that come out immediately and say “CRISIS ACTOR!” whenever someone dies, I find that absurd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s also possible that people believe different sets of conspiracies -- just because you poo-poo one set of theories doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t believe others.  Like I truly believe that big-money right-wingers like the Mercers and their ilk are trying to demolish democracy to establish a white supremacist, theocratic one-party state, and they&#39;re doing their utmost to make it happen with every dirty trick they can pull -- including a president that colluded with a foreign power to manipulate our election while his allies try to suppress opposition votes.  I think what&#39;s happening now is the same as when plutocrats plotted to kill FDR.  </p>

<p>But a lot of people who believe things I think are insane would call be a partisan hack Democrat shill for believing these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Naturally. Eventually they get sucked into this vortex. The Donald already has succumbed to the conspiracy forces. Top minds are grooming anarchists as we speak and don&#39;t even realize it. The plan is going perfectly. </p>

<p>For top minds the realization that they are part of a group purposely keeping them dumb is a hard experience for a dumb person to make. It not only takes a leap Into conspiracy, but into critical thinking.  Or at least thinking, period.  Tell that to a group whose mods are tagged as &#39;thought police.&#39;</p>

<p>But even Hollywood now is too obvious for the dumb minds of reddit to fail to comprehend, even though they still do a little .. at this point in time, they will eventually. They too will come Into.  Any who challenge will be absorbed. Even some shills have quit their jobs. Soros is losing members of the new world order , daily.</p>
