<p>Pretty sure when the history books are written 100 years from now if we don’t destroy the planet before then, they will consider 2017 to be around the start of WW3. The inflation, cost of food, low wages, etc are a result of economic warfare between the US and the rest of the world. </p>

<p>We enforce our dollar with military power, it’s a fiat currency with no value system behind it anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Provide some prices.</p>

<p>I just cant imagine the price of dried beans or canned beans and fresh onions/carrots is more expensive than shitty food. I&#39;ve never been able to find it in America. It doesn&#39;t even come close. a can of chick peas is like 70 cents and has way more nutrition than anything else you can buy for 70 cent. Spend 20 bucks on spices that will last you a year and you&#39;ll never been  unhappy. </p>

<p>Honestly I can buy a bag of frozen broccoli, spinach or kale for under 2 dollars. That&#39;s a great meal. Season with a little grated garlic and nutmeg. Perfect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eating out of cans is fresh and healthy? No thanks. It&#39;s nasty and not fresh in my opinion. </p>

<p>Try eating a healthy salad 3 to 4 times a day, everyday, then tell me how much your grocery bills is. Tell me if you get the proper nutrition eating chick peas and canned beans. My wife and I fill our cart with fruit, vegetables, meat, etc and our bill is $200 - $300 every single week. </p>

<p>Compare that to when we ate out of cans, frozen pizza, hot dogs, cheap stuff, we were living off of $100 - $150 a week. </p>

<p>It is cheaper to eat out of the frozen section at Walmart than it is to eat Fresh! I know this because I travel and have to eat on a budget for work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just need to eat them more often. The only reason you have gas is because your gut flora isn&#39;t used to breaking down fermentable carbs. </p>

<p>You can also look for epazote AKA mexican oregano. Aside from making any Mexican dish taste better, it has been proven to reduce the gas produced from eating beans.</p>

<p>It actually tastes great unless you have one of those super taster genes. Then it tastes like Lysol.</p>

<p>Now I buy pasta, some chicken breast, hamburger meat, etc and keep my kitchen stocked with basics. I can cook and it’s healthier, cheaper and lasts a lot longer. Plus leftovers. 😁</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not where I&#39;m from. It&#39;s cheaper to eat out of the frozen section than it is to eat fresh healthy food. In talking to people though, our definition of healthy food is different. People are confusing what I am saying with what the OP is saying. I&#39;m saying healthy food is expensive compared to shitty food.</p>

<p>Some peoples definition of healthy food is canned beans. No thank you. I prefer beans that come straight from the ground into my mouth. That is fresh and healthy. </p>

Every month, doors all over the complex would have 3 day notices and eviction paperwork. The rent went up regularly. I moved when the rent went up to $2300. There were always RVs lined up in the street in front of the building with homeless people. It smelled like urine everywhere and I constantly found hypo needles, foil with heroin residue, and crack pipes all over the complex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it looks like part of a bigger conspiracy, i have seen many very recent examples from all over the world where good furtile gound and water sources were poisend, harvest was detroyed by some &quot;natural&quot; events and Meat or other animal based foods renderd usesless becouse of some scandal.</p>

<p>At the same time many biological farmers are &quot;discouraged&quot; to grow any food and local or personal food and water sources are also recently under attack.</p>

<p>To me it feels like &quot;they&quot; know the endgame is near and they are now using every tool to make food more scarese and when the shit hits the fan there will be even more misery becouse of the absence of food and water. And if we follow &quot;their&quot; path for our future &quot;they&quot; will take complete controll over all food and water sources and take on the responsibilety of resolving the mess &quot;they&quot; created temselves.</p>

<p>The food and water conspiracies run very deep and all effort to better the situation is (at least) making good food more expensive and difficulter to obtain.</p>
