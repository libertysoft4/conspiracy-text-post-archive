        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This came up in another thread &amp; I thought it&#39;d make a fun post.</p>

<p>According to a documentary linked below, Elvis faked his death in 1977 and lived the rest of his days as Elvis impersonator Johnny Harra. The theory goes like this:</p>

<p>The first Elvis impersonator was Johnny Harra. He was Elvis&#39; biological brother, given up for adoption soon after he was born. He and Elvis reunited in the 70&#39;s. By all accounts, people couldn&#39;t tell them apart. In fact, after Elvis&#39; death, Johnny <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MQamNuB.jpg">signed a $2 million deal</a> with (iirc) a Vegas casino to perform as Elvis, exactly because no one could tell the difference. Johnny died of cancer in 1977. Elvis chose to fake his death and live the rest of his life as Johnny. It&#39;s Johnny Harra who is buried at Graceland, not Elvis.</p>

<p>Because Johnny Harra began performing as an Elvis impersonator in 1975, before Elvis died, no one suspected a thing. Elvis could finally walk around in public, as himself, and not be mobbed. He performed at many weddings &amp; other events as Johnny. The people had no idea he was the real deal. And Elvis loved every minute of it. Above all else, Elvis loved making people happy. Once, he came in third place in an Elvis look-alike contest. He died in 2011. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool OP. Not seen any of this, just obviously know its a thing. </p>

<p>That Lisa Marie interview was a bit weird. Like Jemaine Jackson telling some radio he took his bro to the <del>hospital</del> airport after his death but quickly corrected himself.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it also weird that 2 brothers sound exactly the same? Liam doesn&#39;t sound like Noel, Jackson&#39;s don&#39;t really sound like MJ. Got no other examples. Were they twins? Jonas Brothers! They don&#39;t sound the same do they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your last note about brothers sounding the same is not weird.  My brother and I, although four years apart, look the same, sound the same, walk through same, have similar mannerisms, and are usually confused on the phone and at family reunions.  Our own parents and friends have mixed us up before in person.  So no, that isnt entirely unheard of</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well not really relevant then is it? </p>

<p>lol Sorry. Dont mean to be a dick, cant remember what movie I saw that in. Been waiting for the opportunity to set that up.</p>

<p>Anyway, you know of any mother ever gave birth to two sons that both have the same unique amazing singing voice? </p>

<p>Its never happened mate. No mother is that lucky. God always gives one brother the other brothers singing skills. </p>

<p>Saying this as a brother who was robbed. Its bullshit and its the main reason I dont like God.</p>

<p>Yeah sure siblings can all sing but they cant all sing like Elvis or Mj that&#39;d be silly.</p>

Andy, had Barry&#39;s voice, so similar (at that young age). As time went on, Barry&#39;s voice really matured. (look up a later version of the above song.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I have a 1st cousin and we lived together growing up, you can look at us and tell we&#39;re related but we don&#39;t look <em>that much</em> alike (at least I don&#39;t think so), but we sound nearly identical and even my mom can&#39;t tell us apart. </p>

<p>So anyway, I&#39;m away for school and one time I was on the phone with him and my mom called so I merged the calls and she was getting confused because he kept asking questions about a story she already told me in depth about something my grandma did that made her mad. I told her my cousin was on the line but she thought I hung up with him when she called and thought I was just saying random stuff. She was saying stuff like &quot;I just told you all that I&#39;m not repeating it&quot; &quot;did you not listen when I told you all this yesterday?&quot; and he was like no you didn&#39;t and made a joke and we both laughed at the same time and then she was like wtf when did B get on the phone? My own mom can&#39;t tell us apart over the phone unless she really really listens or unless we somehow identify who is who. So I can believe this.</p>

Everyone knows Elvis died on a hill near a nursing home somewhere in east Texas around 2002,but not before he rid the world of “some sort of Bubba ho-tep” threatening human existence. He was rumored to have a “growth on his pecker” that caused problems with his gyrations later in life. </p>
