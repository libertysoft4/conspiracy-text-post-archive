        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This year a highly respected Dutch research program on tv called Radar, had a look at the problem we&#39;re facing with anti-biotics not working properly anymore.</p>

<p>Apparently there&#39;s something called a bacteriophage which is a virus that can eliminate a lot of infections that are now harder and harder to treat. In Georgia (and Russia I believe) the use of bacteriophages is commonplace!</p>

<p>The &quot;problem&quot; for Western medicine is that bacteriophages can not be patented. I&#39;m guessing this is why bacteriophages aren&#39;t talked about.</p>

<p>One of the main benefits of bacteriophages is that they only kill the infection. There&#39;s different bacteriophages for different infections.  With anti-biotics you actually kill more than just the harmful biotics that are creating the infection.</p>

<p>This is the show (in Dutch unfortunately):
<a href="https://radar.avrotros.nl/uitzendingen/gemist/30-10-2017/">https://radar.avrotros.nl/uitzendingen/gemist/30-10-2017/</a></p>

<p>After this show, the presenter was invited to the most watched talkshow in the Netherlands and there the presenter told that a number of people immediately travelled to Georgia (after the Radar show had aired) for treatment because it was their last hope and these people were cured! We&#39;re talking about people that already had a scheduled appointment to amputate a foot or leg to stop the spread of the infection.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s already been a number of people whose limbs did not have to be amputated, just by going to Georgia and get a bacteriophage treatment.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let the mainstream tell you that anti-biotic resistance is happening and that there&#39;s not much we can do about it.</p>

<p>Please spread the word about bacteriophage therapy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey biology major and med student here. In essence that sounds like a good idea, but there can be a lot of problems, some deadly, of using bacteriophages as treatments. 
A few that come to mind are:
- it’s kind of hard to make a virus that is so specific for a receptor or surface protein on bacteria’s surface, it involves a lot of DNA manipulation in order to create something that specific. Even tougher is that this artificial receptor you make on virus has to be JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT of “sticky” for the bacteria target. Too sticky and the virus can easily mutate and become resistant, not sticky enough and the virus may start to accidentally target human cells or your gut microbiome, which is bad.
- viruses have horrible DNA replication accuracy, which means they mutate ALOT (that’s why there’s a new flu vaccine every year and HIV is so hard to cure). So you spend all this time making a super complicated virus that binds to bacteria, but life finds a way, and bacteria have tons of ways to defend themselves. In the same way in which antibiotics are becoming obsolete, so would this virus. 
- shit’s expensive. It takes 10 years and billions of dollars to get a standard medication through the FDA. You have to have a big problem, whose cure would bring in big money to bring this virus to market. Not condoning current medical system but that’s way it currently is.
- bacteriophages can only attack bacteria with cell membrane as outer layer, but a lot of super deadly bacteria have an additional capsule or tough outer layer which bacteriophages cannot penetrate (meningitis, strep)
ALSO THIS IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING IN US BUT FOR CANCER. Last time I️ checked, duke was using viruses like this to cure Glioblastomas (very aggressive brain cancers). It makes more sense to use these viruses on cancers because cancers mutate a lot less than viruses, so don’t run into same problems.</p>

<p>Hope this explains why this isn’t particularly a conspiracy </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allegedly, the Soviet Union actually made a lot of progress in the field as a result of their isolation and weird ideological split from western biology. Was it lysenkoism? I forget.</p>

<p>Supposedly, most of the research was entirely abandoned and left to rot in the early 90&#39;s as part of re-integrating with the western scientific and medical community, so we don&#39;t actually know whether they found cool ways of solving those problems or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>would love to read more about it if you have links, but I find it doubtful. It&#39;s really complicated to make artificial genomes, edit them, or understand the molecular interactions of proteins. Shotgun sequencing, CRISPR editting, and the proper computing power simply didn&#39;t exist to methodically study this during the Soviet Era. All this science is VERY new, and we&#39;ve only found ways to make it relatively cheap and efficient in the last 5 years.

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, I don&#39;t have more about to share : (. but my understanding was that early research was actually based on trying to find phages in the environment that worked on specific types of bacteria and then playing with them in labs trying to find stuff that would work on humans. No idea just how far they got, but it was claimed where I saw it that they actually did find some functional medical applications.</p>

<p>I have no idea how they got around the issues you mentioned in your first post, because, yeah,, those seem like big barriers. It may be worth mentioning that there was a fair bit of &#39;fuck it let&#39;s see what happens&#39;  going on in the soviet union from what I&#39;ve seen. There where a lot of underfunded researchers and doctors just sort of flinging things at the walls and trying to see what shit stuck and it&#39;s sometimes hard to know what stuff really was legit and what stuff just kind of seemed to work because controls where bad. I just know phage research had something to do with lysenkoism making western biology unfashionable and a political liability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If youre in med school and a biology major, why dont you know that many pathogenic bacteria have naturally occurring bacteriophages?</p>

<p>Bacteriophage therapy is suppressed because they&#39;re not GMOs that can be patented and would be classified as a supplement like probiotics, hence BIG PHARMA cant make billions of dollars on them.</p>

<p>It most definitely is a conspiracy.</p>
