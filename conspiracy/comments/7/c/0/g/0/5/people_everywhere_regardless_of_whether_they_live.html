<p>But this is literally why people advocate socialism. It&#39;s not about free stuff or laziness,  it&#39;s about power and control. Those who spend their lives performing labor should have ownership of that labor. That isn&#39;t the case under capitalism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is- what form of socialism are you talking about? &quot;Socialism&quot; refers to a wide range of ideologies, each only really connected through common support for social ownership of the means of production. If you&#39;re talking Marxism-Leninism(/Stalinism/Maoism) (distinct from &quot;Marxism&quot; which isn&#39;t so much a socialist ideology as it is a means of historical analysis) then I would be inclined to agree. Placing the means of production under the authority of a single party state bureaucracy obviously lends itself to an authoritarian structure and the creation of a new class of elites. This is what we saw occur in the USSR, especially after Stalin stole power from the Soviets (worker councils), as well as in China. There are arguments to be made (especially in Lenin&#39;s work) about the necessity of this sort of organization in order to effectively quash capitalist resistance, but I still do not presumably support this form of socialism. </p>

<p>However, again, socialism just means the people own the means of production. It doesn&#39;t <em>have to be</em> through the use of a central state. There are various forms of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">libertarian socialism</a> which exist explicitly because of these anti-authoritarian concerns. My favorite (so far) is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a>, which is essentially the direct ownership of the means of production by the workers themselves (or their trade unions). </p>

<p>This could even be paired with a modern idea like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/parpolity">participatory politics, or parpolity</a> to ensure it retains a democratic structure. The idea with that is to organize political society in nested councils of 50 or so people, your closest neighbors, to elect representation to the next higher tier. Only five or six tiers are necessary to see every citizen in America represented, and there are only five or six people between you and &quot;the top.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>80% correct here, I meant that Marxism is a mainstream form of sociological methodology that examines the rule of &quot;the elite&quot; (although Marxists tend to use the term haute, or high, bourgeoisie). But yeah, I&#39;m absolutely not saying that Marxists are in charge in any way, shape or form, with the exception of whatever Marxist-Leninist states are left (i.e. Cuba, the libertarian Marxists of the Zapatistas, China I guess?

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there are, but he mentioned wealth (indicating a class component) and he said that theories about their control of society should be considered mainstream sociology. Marxism fits those criteria. I mean, that&#39;s literally what Marxism <em>is</em>. It&#39;s a specific form of sociological methodology that analyzes society in terms of class, property ownership, and the class relations that ownership results in. </p>

<p>Tbh there&#39;s a lot of Marxist critique that people here would love, some of it closely parallels the rhetoric you see here. It&#39;s just that what&#39;s &quot;Wall Street&quot; and &quot;the globalists&quot; to this sub are referred to as &quot;finance capital&quot; (or international finance capital). This is sometimes contrasted with local industrial based capital in Marxist rhetoric. You can see the sort of divergence of interests between these spheres of the haute bourgeoisie (&quot;the elite&quot;) in the opposition between organizations like Goldman Sachs (international finance capital) and the Kochs (national industrial capital). However, although the interests of various spheres of the elite may occasionally conflict, they are united against <em>us</em>- the working class. That&#39;s why you see Republicans and Democrats working together everywhere it matters (i.e. preventing universal Healthcare, using regulation to quash attempts at city level broadband, etc).</p>

<p>Theories about control by wealthy elites should be considered normal sociology, rather than conspiracy theories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In essence &quot;socialism&quot; is organizing against oppression by the dis-proportionally powerful, by having the workers control the means of production instead. In the developed world dis-proportionally powerful pretty much equates the &quot;wealthy elites&quot; a.k.a. the ones who own the lion share of available capital, the capitalists.</p>

<p>Lot&#39;s of good material on that :)</p>

<p>We missed an opportunity with Bernie (with his main message to reform campaign finance laws). He DID pave the way for a Bernie 2.0 to be an honest fighter against the influence of money on government. </p>

Sanders does what he&#39;s told by TPTB, just like every other politician who owes their entire existence to elected office. Trump&#39;s election represents the sad reality that the only the very wealthy or very well-connected have access to the political process. It is an oligarchy, one that has been growing in power since the 1960&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Game Theory and everything else says that Bernie did the right thing by not attempting to fight the establishment after the DNC convention. He and his &quot;revolution&quot; are STRONGER now after the election BECAUSE he went that route. Had he broken with Democrats for 2016, we would be hearing from every elite pundit that he was also working for Putin. Him and progressives would be labeled as outright traitors. </p>

<p>P.s. that charge is bunk of course. </p>

<p>Bernie has been the only politician in a LOOOOONG time highlighting how the wealthy are the ones with the access. He decided to run his campaign on the backs of small donors, as a representative for those voices.</p>

<p>Also, File Exempt on your Taxes for the rest of the year.  Hold up the money from the Government like the American Patriots did to England.
This probably wont work for people who own houses and have nowhere to go, but make sure to 
Hide your assets do not declare where you work (avoid wage garnishments), misinform all debt collectors and claim unemployed.</p>

<p>Keep your money out of your bank accounts balances of less the $10, they will levy them.  You can carry cash and banks like Chase will post cash deposits that day in order to make pmts on your phone or when you need to use a debit card.</p>

<p>Consumers can crash the system.  And then we can get the pitchforks and torches and march on the elites like the did in France.  </p>
