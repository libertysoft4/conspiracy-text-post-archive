        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last night (Sat, Nov 11th 2017) was veterans day. I was volunteering at my local conference center that was holding a veterans supper. The event was hosted by the Freemasons society. After the event was over, I got the opportunity to speak with the local head master of the organization. We shook hands and exchanged pleasantries, but I couldn&#39;t help but have my eyes drawn to his tie. It was a red silk tie with a bunch of symbols all over it. It had the masonic symbol, the sword of Justice, but there was also another symbol. A pentagram with a circle around it. I tired not to stare to much and luckily he didn&#39;t notice because he was speaking with one of my fellow volunteers. A few minutes past and he announced his need to leave. We shook hands once more and he left. Once he was out of hearing range, I turned to my friend and asked him if he noticed the tie as well. He said yes. 
TL;DR The Freemasons are satanists</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah its weird... Freemasonry is old, at least 400 years old, some say older. So there&#39;s a big grab bag of misunderstood symbolism that we use. There&#39;s definitely an undercurrent of western esotericism in the mix that got added later, it all makes sense when explained, but to the uninitiated its super weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, the upside down symbol almost always means Luciferianism.  The symbol is far more ancient than LaVey.  The Freemasons and co employ the concept of inversion with gusto.  </p>

<p>Yes, there are biblical inverted stars to symbolize the crucifixtion, god looking down on earth, etc, but those uses have context.</p>

<p>In this context, the inverted star is Luciferian.  Freemasons mock Christianity to no end.</p>

<p>Whatever practices it describes, whatever group it encompasses, uses the inverted star, and has used the inverted star.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, no semantics games at all. And here&#39;s a source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_of_Baphomet">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_of_Baphomet</a> </p>

<p>&quot;The familiar goat&#39;s head inside an inverted pentagram/pentacle did not become the foremost symbol of Satanism until the founding of the Church of Satan in <strong>1966</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>And frankly, members of La Vey&#39;s Church of Satan would not be admitted to mainstream Freemasonry, as they are atheists. Our only requirement is belief in a supreme being and (in many places) a continuance of the soul. We never ask what someone&#39;s beliefs are past that.</p>

<p>And further sources as to why this is not semantic, but an important distinction.
Luciferianism, as a religion is also a pretty modern invention (relatively speaking) and is a theistic religion. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism</a></p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes mistakenly associated with Satanism due to the Christian interpretation of the fallen angel, Luciferianism is a wholly different belief system[26] and does not revere the devil figure or most characteristics typically affixed to Satan. Rather, Lucifer in this context is seen as one of many morning stars, a symbol of enlightenment,[27] independence and human progression, and is often used interchangeably with similar figures from a range of ancient beliefs, such as the Greek titan Prometheus or the Jewish talmudic figure Lilith.&quot;</p>

<p>I personally identify with Christian Deism more than anything else.. <a href="http://christiandeism.com/">http://christiandeism.com/</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ah i see your mistake OP .</p>

<p>Freemasons need only 1 thing . the belief in God .</p>

<p>everything else is open to interpretation ..</p>

<p>God to you may not be the God to the person standing beside you , no many view on God is the same .</p>

<p>to some God is a man who created all life , to others hes the spark that started the big bang , to others he was an alien who came to earth and seeded the human race from Apes .. to others hes a mystical being who has no body but can be every where and no where ..</p>

<p>Freemasons study perception of them selves and how the human brain thinks and can be altered to think differently  through esoterica  (enlightenment ) </p>

<p>Ex “Virtus Junxit Mors Non Separabit
(Whom virtue unites, death cannot separate)”
― The Scottish Rite Fourteenth degree</p>

<p>, the secrets of Alchemy , and sacred geometry ( flower of life ) another thing they study is Pythagoras .. </p>

<p>ask any mason here on reddit , i know theres quite a few of them about esoterica  , its a bunch of phrases and sayings that change how you view something and quite remarkable too , they refer to  it as wisdom of enlightenment .</p>

<p>as for a 5 sided star here is a fun way to learn all about it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLffxwRlXcc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLffxwRlXcc</a> </p>

<p>i am not a mason but we do have them in town and they willingly speak openly about what they do without giving away secrets .</p>

<p>PS i am not saying there are no masons who worship Satan , there may be but most do not call him Satan , they call him Lucifer and hold him in high honor because he gave the light of knowledge and truth to man while God held man in bondage and darkness , when you see God as a dictator for wanting man to be blind sheep you see Satan ( Lucifer ) as nothing more than a freedom fighter fighting for truth and freedom from  a tyrant </p>
