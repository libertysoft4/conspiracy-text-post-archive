        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since about a week and a half after the shooting happened, I&#39;ve heard practically nothing regarding the shooting. This was probably one of the most important mass shootings in history due to the fact it involved a major music artist and was one of the deadliest, yet it got covered the least?? The Weinstein scandal got more fucking publicity then it. </p>

<p>What motive would there be for the media to not publish articles regarding it? There&#39;s so much content that we&#39;ve barely heard anything about, and the more content they publish the more viewers they get which gives them more revenue. So what the fuck is going on?? Sorry for my language, this is just really bothering me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have to agree. It almost seemed they were using the public to gauge which direction the narrative should go. Public awareness was reaching critical proportions, then useful distractions. Or sacrifices as I like to think of them.</p>

<p>Most important thing is for them  to protect the government. A sacrifice like Weinstein and other big fishes appeal to the conspiracy theorist and pizzagaters and become more important than Vegas.  </p>

<p>It is also worth noting that the general public has a short attention span it seems, but things are moving very fast now. It&#39;s not that Vegas is forgotten it just becomes yet another false flag to add to the growing pool.  People still talk about 9/11 Boston bombing, Sandy hook, we won&#39;t forget about Vegas but when they stopped even giving us info then that does kind of stopped what is available to analyze from official sources.  If anything this has shown us a lot about these false flags and how gov operates.</p>

Impossible unless he stopped in the middle of the shooting, shut the door, and &quot;secured&quot; it some other way- not using the lock.

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously?</p>

<p>I&#39;m mostly pro-gun.  I&#39;m prior military.</p>

<p>The main reason I can&#39;t see the LV shooting or any potential (however unlikely) cover-up as being for an anti-gun talk is the fact that Sandy Hook happened without consequence.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t further legislate gun control on the deaths of young school children, it&#39;s a lost cause.</p>

<p>Also, casinos have cameras everywhere but the rooms.  Not sure what further security they need, short of inspecting every bag coming in like the TSA, which I can&#39;t imagine they&#39;d want.</p>

<p>I understand this is a conspiracy sub, but you have to think logically.  What&#39;s the aim and what is the supposed outcome?</p>

I don&#39;t know too much about how it would affect gun legislation, but what you&#39;re saying makes sense. What does that leave as the only other option? That something big happened that we don&#39;t know about that night. Something involving the Saudi&#39;s and the helicopter landing on the roof of the helipad.</p>

<p>Someone commented on how that app or whatever doesn&#39;t work with complete details.  Also, what gain do the Saudis have by being involved.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a weird case all around.  There&#39;s an apparently well off person, with no apparent motive (other than lost money) to attack this place.</p>

<p>No letters, that we know of, and no obvious political affiliation.  It may have been planned, but it seems far from a concerted effort.</p>

<p>If you are told an epic story and you ask questions about the hero and the villain and all of the plot holes, and they give an answer that makes no sense in that universe... and then they stop answering questions about it without ever giving a decent answer to any important question... one might say that story is total shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All official narratives are trying to pin it on a lone shooter, which is hilariously bullshit.  Consider that the upper floors of that hotel are owned by the Saudis, and on the night of the shooting, a helicopter was allowed to touch down and pick up a Saud prince (in the middle of a terrorist atrack.  Really?).  Consider that this particular prince was later arrested in that Saudi Arabia pseudo-coup for corruption and other charges.  Consider the NUMEROUS multiple shooter reports from those at the scene.  Note how the local police chief HAD to have a handler next to him and tell him what to say or let him know if he was saying too much.   Look at the alleged &quot;hero&quot; who was shot in the leg and a key witness to the biggest mass shooting in recent US history, but he was allowed to leave the country for alnost a week.  Then to only appear on fucking Ellen Degenerate and give his only interview, which was clearly led by Ellen herself and he just sat there and agreed with it.  </p>

<p>This whole thing reeks of a huge and poorly managed cover-up.  Either there was a gun deal gone bad, an assassination attempt on a Saudi royal, or some other false flag theory to distract the public.  The official narrative is broken beyond repair, and instead of adding more band-aids, they are dropping it completely.  Very shitty damage control.  </p>

The casino industry and the city itself don&#39;t want to be in the papers all the time over a story that might drive conventions and tourists away.  They have enough clout to keep the information flow extremely limited and enough lawyers and private security advisors to keep the locals and Feds at arms length.</p>

<p>All that said, there is absolutely no reason that this should hinder a &quot;free&quot; press from investigating and covering.  To be that&#39;s the truly odd part...</p>

<p>He played Tom Petty&#39;s &quot;Won&#39;t Back Down.&quot; Maybe they were afraid to let him get in front of a mic again.</p>

<p>Interesting note on the CMAs, there was an act where Eric Church, who also played the Vegas music festival, sang an acoustic version of Amazing Grace. It led into a group number with all the country stars singing together. It felt like a custom made moment for Aldean to put on a powerful performance. Instead they all sang the Hootie and the Blowfish hit &quot;Hold My Hand&quot; led by Darius Rucker. I&#39;m my opinion that was an easy backup song everyone would know the words to and further pushed Vegas from our minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very strange for sure. Sources within the hostage rescue team that was sent up the hotel to take him out say he fired on them, and then they shot him. Supposedly he had set up cameras streaming to somewhere for others to watch. They also found Antifa material, and there is links to ISIS. To me this sounds like a false flag, and I think the reason it&#39;s not being covered is because it&#39;s part of a larger investigation with many arrests being made around the world right now. The owner of the top five floors of Mandalay bay is a Saudi Arabian prince and has been recently arrested. There is a major purge happening, and continuing this coming week. The cabal is being rounded up, and there is going to be massive civil unrest when you see who will be next. The American left is going to flip out when next arrests happen, as they think Trump is going after his political adversaries, and believe the lie that Russia affected the outcome of the election. There is a reason why the government investigation isn&#39;t interviewing Julian Assange, because they all know Russia didn&#39;t hack the emails, they were leaked, but need to keep this story going to save themselves. This is going to be very big news.</p>

<p>However yes, so far no surveillance video footage has been released to the public from the hotel showing him even walking into the building. There is a war going on in the deep state community.</p>

<p>If you want more information, this is all connected to this:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As we all know, this story barely has an official story, except the basics but is lacking details. There is a lot eyewitnesses that have conflicting views, and there is more questions than answers. Either way there is a cover up for some reason, which there is many reasons as I&#39;m sure you can imagine.</p>

<p>The source about the FBI hostage rescue team and what they found that wasn&#39;t being reported by the media for the official narrative was from Alex Jones which was sent to him by his source in the FBI. I&#39;ll provide the link and let you look further if you want:</p>

<p>This was the live clip:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqql4js8lo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqql4js8lo</a></p>

<p>Then you have ISIS claiming he converted to islam months ago, multiple times even though the FBI and media was saying there is nothing to that. You can google that because it was reported for a while. ISIS has been making contacts with drug cartels in Mexico under common cause against the US, and has been working with MS13 to help with human trafficking getting their people into the US. Then Antifa in Europe has been contacting ISIS due to their shared hatred, along with Antifa in the US traveling to Europe to make connections as well. You have to look at it as a controlled opposition using A-symetric warfare and funding rebels to use to incite civil unrest and attacks. Follow the money, which seems to be drying up with the purge of various covert connections and the shell companies. Trump is making moves behind the scenes which are not making that much noise in the media because they are focused on taking him down, not talking about successes. The dark web which was taken down recently Alpha Bay and Hansa, which was a major market place to fund dark operations and organize human traficking.</p>

<p>I believe Julian Assange is still alive, as I haven&#39;t seen evidence to sway me that he&#39;s not.</p>

<p>I understand the MGM&#39;s desire to not get further bad publicity, but when a crime takes place the surveilance video is collected by the authorities, which for some reason has not been shown to the public through the news channels at all. Nothing which is strange.</p>

<p>Plus now we have CNN asking questions like why does the shooters motive even matter. My initial thought to the media not covering the largest mass shooting in US history is because it didn&#39;t fit their narrative they have been pushing on the American people. At first you had people on twitter happy that likely Trump supporters were killed even though not all country music fans are Trump supporters. It doesn&#39;t fit the narrative that right wing nut jobs with guns are killing black people, which is what they tend to push.</p>

<p>Either way, I have more question than answers, just trying to provide some info to the convo.</p>

<p>There will be a few weeks of the Texas shooting and the right to bear arms bullshit. It will go quiet, then there will be another. Either aimed at new gun laws or terrorism and laws to shut the borders. </p>

<p>The real terrorists are the people in power. The ones who mastermind these bullshit events to try and solidify their Personal agendas. Fuck the 1%. It&#39;s a shame that the people who truly have the power, the 99%, don&#39;t wake the fuck up and realise this. 
Instead they would rather vote in a new leader, then complain when they lose out. Fuck the rest of the world! I want my damn wall! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Out of curiosity, let&#39;s toil under the assumption that the Vegas shooting line so the other mass shootings are a false flag event. What is the point? The cia just likes to shoot Americans? This is a continuous attempt to be able to adjust the second? If it is the latter seems a bit redundant considering any push to adjust the second has stalled after each previous mass shooting. If it is the former then why do they just like to shoot Americans? Seems like a lot of people on this sub are so quick to claim conspiracy, but never sut down to think about why there would be a reasoning behind the conspiracy. People are posting about his an exec from cnbc had his children killed after a report on a fraud case claiming it was obviously the defendants in the case who orchestrated the killings. Ok? But, why? The guy wasn&#39;t part of the case. What would be the Motive behind killing his kids? Case is still on going... High ranking dems kill fuck children in the basement of a pizza place to gain favor with Satan. Ook? Am I supposed to assume that Satan is real? And that Satan will grant me special powers in this life if i do sacrifice kids in his name? That&#39;s asking me to assume a lot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Q on 4chan</p>

<ul>
<li>SA Opposition tried to assassinate SA Prince</li>
<li>Potus group foiled attack, price evacuated</li>
<li>Assasins found in room w/ &quot;shooter&quot;</li>
<li>CIA/FBI coverup that SA was involved in fear of war</li>
<li>Opposition prince assassinated in SA 2 weeks later</li>
<li>Prince arrested in SA </li>
</ul>

<p>So long story short, if true, SA, the FBI and CIA are to blame for the shooting, and it really didn&#39;t need to happen.  All it was was to coverup international involvement.  </p>
