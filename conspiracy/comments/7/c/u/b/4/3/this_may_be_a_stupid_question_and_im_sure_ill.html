    <div class="md"><p>You raise a good question honestly. I guess it depends on the actual value of the greenback towards goods, vs the supply of greenbacks distributed. Honestly, this is way over my head but it did make me think about the current federal reserve system and how it&#39;s created a huge disparity in wealth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed it does. Some people are more industrious than others. Some can take that green back and turn it into 50 potatoes or more, others would rather just eat the potato. Humans are not all the same. We all have equal inherent unalienable rights but, we are not all the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s an interesting concept to think about.</p>

<p>I personally believe that money created helps the people at the front of the line first - and it still helps those it trickles down to, just not to the same degree.</p>

<p>Search on YouTube for a speech called “the creature from Jekyll Island”. It’s a speech given by an author that examined the history of the Fed and questions its purpose.</p>

<p>I think you’ll find it informative, and you’ll discover that the original intent wasn’t as noble as it seems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe if the amount of new currency was limited to a certain amount created, based on expected population by the following year? And to have it be publicly available to exactly where it was distributed at the beginning of each fiscal year? Other wise, business as usual as far as economy goes.

    <div class="md"><p>Good question.  </p>

<p>A complete reboot of the financial system is definitely something to consider..<br/>
But let&#39;s face it, we are too many people, too globally connected to have a successful Gold backed currency...  </p>

<p>*shrugs* I&#39;m not an economic, I just see that stuff stopped working in favor of the majority a long time ago... But I don&#39;t see Bitcoin as universal solution... too cumbersome to be handled by everyone, and i wouldn&#39;t trust any implementation that would be more convenient to handle for non-tech savvy people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it is a world wide currency, so a US ban would just hurt the US. The BTC value would feel the impact, but it would largely continue without the self-ostracizing countries. The US couldn&#39;t really ban it, per se, but make exchanging BTC for cash and visa versa more difficult. It would be more like back in the early days of Bitcoin, when I used to mail cash for Bitcoins on LocalBitcoins, rather than just connecting my bank account to an exchange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well that is the thing if it was really a threat to the world bankers control it would end up illegal almost everywhere at the same time.</p>

<p>if BTC couldnt be used in the US and the EU its value would crumble and most people would lose a ton of value, its not really anchored to anything other than speculation. my fear is anyone buying in now is just going to get left holding the bill when it eventually crashes, the people who got in early and are selling now are making fortunes off of nothing but the speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interest free currency creation will save the country…the world.</p>

<p>Until 1967 Canada created their currency, interest free, through the Bank of Canada by spending into existence through infrastructure spending. Roads, schools, hospitals,2 world wars and Korea.</p>

<p>Now we borrow money into existence through private banks with compounding interest (as does the US).</p>

<p>Make no mistake about it, ending the Fed and returning to a non-debt based economy where new currency is spent into existence for the benefit of the people would change the entire country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Current interest based system is based on the assumption that the economy will experience perpetual growth. Pair that with the natural scenario a) perpetual growth is unrealistic, wasteful, harmful to the environment, detrimental to innovation etc, and  b) that any corporation/business will do anything to ensure survival and you end up with the situation we have now, economic factors that continue to go uncorrected or covered up with a band-aid leading to a bubble. The situation is so extreme now and financial nerds are so sophisticated that the economy is still churning after several bubbles were never actually corrected, only sidestepped. You can only kick the can so far down the road; our can got kicked off a cliff. Ending the fed is a great idea in concept, but I think given the layers of our plastic economy seeing actual results would take a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well not really if that is the only thing that changes. at this point for a new currency to change anything the old one needs to crash, and crash hard.</p>

<p>that crash would pretty much exterminate the lower class, its not like we have property assets to really fall back on to rebuild our wealth. the lower class mostly rents, and saves so they can buy their kids a ticket out.</p>

<p>in these crashes the wealthy have most of their wealth tied up in real estate or actual goods (because they can afford to) and in a crash most of their wealth would be preserved and simply transfered over in to whatever new currency would take its place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at it this way...if a currency is backed by something tangible (a precious metal) or the supply is strictly limited and transparent (crtypto), then the wages workers are earning have value.  Banks will compete to attract that currency (by offering higher interest rates).</p>

<p>Because money can be created out of thin air, banks have no incentive to pay any interest on our savings.  That’s why we get 0.01% interest on a savings account.  How do poor people save?  The stock market?  No, a savings account or a mattress.</p>

<p>If the poor aren’t earning anything in the bank, if their mattress savings are being inflated away, this means they have to work more.  They have to work longer to retirement.</p>

<p>Limiting the supply of money gives workers’ wages value.</p>
