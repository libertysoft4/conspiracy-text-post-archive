    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;ll say it again. <a href="https://www.icij.org/about/our-supporters/">ICIJ</a>  is the source for the Paradise Papers. ICIJ is a nonprofit organization that relies on charitable foundations and financial support from the public. One of the donors is none other than the <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org">open Society Foundation</a> . A Soros foundation. You even said yourself that Soros is such a small part of it. It&#39;s a classic move. If you want to bite at old Georgie boys bait go right ahead. Your initial question was answered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you misunderstand. We, the people, need to know and understand the laws so that we can use them to our advantage. The top%ers do this, and so could the rest of society.

    <div class="md"><p>Disagree all you want, it is a free country [as of now].</p>

<p>But, taxes go to private banks via national debt, and the majority of the rest goes to fund wars. Where people store their money has nothing to do with the nation&#39;s economy. That only happens when the money is SPENT. Even so, if the money were kept in on-shore banks, it would only serve to increase more debt via fractional lending. Any way you lookout it, your comment makes now sense in the realty of how things work.  </p>
