        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Don&#39;t you guys think it&#39;s really really odd how they say they didnt breach the room earlier because they were formulating a plan - but the best plan they came up with was 5 guys who had never worked together before storming the room of someone they know has cameras outside and automatic weapons.</p>

<p>Why those 5 guys? Why did they send only 5 men in when they had suspected for the last hour and 20mins there was multiple shooters, they admitted they were suprised to find only Paddock there, but yet they only had a 5man team with no ballistic shields or anything after 1hr 20min of a massacre in a Casino town? Are you kidding me? What the funk is going on? Why did they call Battlefield Vegas to use their armoured cars but only end up sending 5 random cops, one of them a detective to do a specialized room breach on the target suspect of a huge massacre involving suspected automatic gunfire.. weird</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The LVMPD SWAT team is a nationally respected organization.[citation needed] The team, composed of nearly 40 operators, is one of a handful of full-time SWAT teams in the country. The team&#39;s main objective is to save lives, victims as well as suspects. They are on the cutting edge on the use of a constantly changing array of less-lethal weapons and munitions. Team members are highly trained and work in no less than two-man cells.</p>

<p>LVMPD SWAT conducts training both for LVMPD recruits and seasoned officers within the department plus visiting agencies from across the country as well as foreign police units. In any given year, they will respond to an average of 55 hostage incidents and execute over 365 high risk search warrants and/or arrest warrants.[citation needed]SWAT also provides dignitary protection for the President of the United States, the Vice President, visiting heads of state and other dignitaries during visits to the Las Vegas area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your opinion would they send one member of a swat team to the scene of an active shooter? These were extraordinary circumstances so I don&#39;t want to apply too much logic, but still curious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of this doesn&#39;t make sense. I could see a grab bag of different cops (Patrol, SWAT, Detectives) responding to the active shooter and going in. That&#39;s how the nationwide active shooter training for LE goes. You generally wait until you have 2+ cops, then you go in and respond. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in active shooter/barricaded suspect calls in which I just happened to be close to the call when it came out and responded to assist the street deputies. In that situation it was myself, and 2 road deputies who were assigned the call. Many times even larger departments can take a while to deploy their SWAT/SED units, simply because you have no &quot;full time&quot; SWAT guys basically just sitting around in turnouts; ready to go. So you have to send out the SWAT page and wait for members to respond, change into gear, get briefed, formulate a plan of attack (no matter how brief), and execute. </p>

<p>So, in a situation like Vegas, having as many special unit guys on scene, I&#39;m not sure as to why they didn&#39;t form up together and do likewise. Rather than send in a rag tag handful of street guys and 1 SWAT guy. However, I will add that big emergency/active shooter situations like this, you get every supervisor on the planet for every local agency trying to delegate all at once and it becomes a clusterfuck beyond belief within a matter of minutes. So there&#39;s no telling how much of whatever plan to respond went to shit when there were too many chiefs, a few guys might have said &quot;Hey, we need to respond and do something!&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are REALLY misinformed. They didn&#39;t send one SWAT guy. They followed active shooter protocol (MACTAT) which has the first 4 or 5 officers (regardless of position, expertise or responsibility) who are able to form a team to move in on the shooter. In this case, it was a combination of K9, SWAT and patrol officers. The four of them arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17pm. Over the next hour, a dozen more officers (SWAT and patrol) reached the floor and then SWAT breached the suite at 11:20pm. </p>

<p>Idk where you&#39;re getting this info about SWAT only deploying one officer to the scene, but it&#39;s completely false. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean you don&#39;t know where I&#39;m getting that information? You literally include where I am getting that info in the first part of your comment. All you had to say was &quot;only 4 initially reported, but they waited to breach until more swat arrived&quot; </p>

<p>By the way, most articles I have read describe this in an intentionally misleading way, take this one for example: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/09/us/las-vegas-shooting-response/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/09/us/las-vegas-shooting-response/index.html</a></p>

<p>It alludes to the fact that their were more officers, but then tells the story as if those 4 breached on their own. </p>

<p>Anyway, the post above yours is well reasoned and a great review of how a chaotic situation like that might play out based on protocols. After reading what he said I&#39;m inclined to think it is reasonable that an ad hoc group of 4 would move on the room. The hour time delay is still odd, but hey, not a situation that we should apply too much logic to. </p>

<p>No, that is false! Listen to the police scanner audio. There are <em>multiple</em> 4-man teams looking for the shooter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should make sure your facts are correct before telling other people they are misinformed..</p>

<p>There was ONLY ONE Swat member present for the breach of the room, you can&#39;t provide any proof otherwise...</p>

<p>Over the next hour those dozen officers moved through the hotel, some moving up through the stairwell some from the elevator hallway, but when asked one the radio whether the 5man team had enough guns/equipment up there - the 5man team replied they had men and enough rifles and to try to avoid coming up here if possible..</p>

<p>You also state SWAT breached the suite at 11.20pm this is plain fantasy.. At no time was a SWAT team breaching the room, there was 1 SWAT officer plus the adhock rag tag team of officers, one in barefoot despite over an 1hour passing since the start of the shooting.</p>

<p>The CBS interview &quot; The men who stormed room 135&quot; makes it pretty damn clear. </p>

<p>Get your facts right before talking down to other people like you know it all.</p>

<p>They even suspected the room service cart to be rigged to explosives but didn&#39;t call in any explosives experts.
They were just happy to walk on in there with the chance of being blown up. Must be very brave men.</p>

<p>You have to remember Jesus Campos was shot at the START of the massacre so what is the excuse for &#39;looking&#39; for the shooter, Jesus had radioed the shooters location at the start of the massacre apparently.</p>

<p>But listen to the police scanner audio. They had no clue what room it was in until at least 6 minutes into the crowd shooting. They didn&#39;t even know about the security guard on the 32nd floor until they got up there. Campos and/or MB security did NOT alert authorities right away. That is real problem here. Police wasted so much time trying to find the shooter even though hotel staff knew where he was before the shooting even began. It&#39;s infuriating. </p>

<p>Campos, Schuck and Mandalay Bay Security are all lying, and Lombardo is now lying to protect them for some reason, which is made all the more bizarre by the fact that not only is he telling a different story than Mandalay Bay, he&#39;s also telling a <em>better</em> story. I don&#39;t know for sure <em>why</em> he&#39;s lying and aiding in MGM&#39;s cover-up, but I suspect it&#39;s due to a combination of intimidation (by MGM and FBI, who are scrambling to cover up their own negligence) and guilt (his guys did a shit job vetting Campos after they found him). </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Where is the record of that though? The first time it&#39;s mentioned in the police scanner audio is 6 minutes into the shooting, when officers say they&#39;re in the 31st floor of Mandalay Bay and shots are being fired directly above them. Police should NOT have had to discover that on their own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Campos, he called down to Security via cellphone, in order to free up the channel.</p>

<p>But then... why does Schuck feel the need to radio down to dispatch about the shooting, if Jesus, standing just a few feet away from him, is already on the phone with dispatch? </p>

<p>Why do the people Schuck is heard talking to in the audio recording seem to have no knowledge or details about the shooting? How come when they ask Schuck what room the shooter is in, he can&#39;t tell them, if Jesus is standing right next to him and knows exactly what room shots are coming from? </p>

<p>How come, every time the Sheriff references the security guard&#39;s call down to dispatch, he uses the word &quot;attempted&quot; (at least 3 separate times I&#39;ve counted so far)? He never says &quot;He radioed down,&quot; he always says &quot;He <em>attempted</em> to radio down.&quot; </p>

<p>How come the Sheriff has no timestamp of when Campos reported the shooting? </p>

<p>My guess is because Campos never actually/successfully radioed it in. </p>

<p>They were getting false reports of shots fired from several different hotels, Tropicana for example. They already had officers on the floor, the group that pried open the door that Paddock sealed, who reported the shooters location and that the shooting had ceased. They had another team that worked there way up to the 32nd floor, sweeping lower floors because of false reports. Once they made it to 3nd floor they joined up with the officers already there to breach the room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one SWAT officer was with the team holding the stairwell between 31 and 32. Team on 32 advises the team in the stairwell to not come up through the stairwell door because they have enough people and rifles to hold the hallway looking at Paddock&#39;s room and to wait for the SWAT team. There were multiple teams in the hotel because they had to clear multiple floors. If you listen too the full audio recording of the police scanner you can hear there are reports of shots from all over from many different hotels, which are also debunked on the recording. As far as they know there are multiple shooters so they can&#39;t send all their SWAT officers to the Mandalay Bay. A SWAT team moves up to the 32nd floor to breach the door.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SHERIFF JOE LOMBARDO: <strong>Between 10:26 and 10:30, eight additional officers arrived on the 32nd floor</strong> and begin to move systematically down the hallway, clearing each room and looking for any injured people. This – they move this way because they no longer hear the gunfire of the active shooter situation. </p>

<p><strong>10:55, eight officers arrive in the stairwell at the opposite end of the hallway nearest the suspect&#39;s room</strong>. So, when I say nearest to suspect&#39;s room, you can imagine the doorway of the hotel room. This stairwell, and this door access is approximately two to three feet away. </p>

<p>11:20, the first breach was set off and officers entered the suspect&#39;s room. They observed the suspect down on the ground and also saw a second door that could not be accessed from their position. So, it&#39;s a suite. And we have, there’s, you have a main area of the suite, which is a living room, a kitchen/dinette area, and then on opposite ends of that is two bedrooms. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry. Where did I leave off? Somebody yell it out. Okay, so, if you do the math on that, all the way up to 11:20, from 10:05, we&#39;re looking at 75 minutes. So, young lady here in the front, with the red phone, you had mentioned 72 minutes. Now, you see where those minutes come from, okay?</p>

<p>At 11:27, a second breach was set off allowing officers to access the <em>second</em> room, and no one else was located within the hotel room. </p>

<p>Okay, these are following extenuating circumstances as to why we may appeared, that there was some delay, or undue delay, in reaching the suspects. Okay, <strong>the officers in the first strike team reached the 32nd floor within 12 minutes</strong> – which is phenomenal – of the first shot being fired. When the officers arrived and confirmed the location of the suspect&#39;s room, the gunfire had stopped. </p>

<p>In accordance with their training, the officers retrieved a master key card from the injured security guard, and began to systematically clear each hotel room. So, imagine the elevator bank in the center, 150 feet down on a triplex hotel, was the suspect&#39;s room. So, there&#39;s several rooms along the way. Because no firing was occurring, they could not hear additional firing, they believed it was important to evacuate in case the suspect was barricaded. </p>

<p>While the first strike team did this, <strong>the second team made up of two K9 personnel, a SWAT officer, and patrol officers, navigated the numerous stairs wearing heavy tactical gear, carrying a large bag with tactical equipment, and holding rifles in order to have a closer position to the suspect&#39;s room</strong>. And that is within that stairwell and that doorway adjacent to the room I described previously. </p>

<p>They attempted to secure the front doorway of the suspect&#39;s room. But as they entered into the hallway, they could see the room service cart and readily apparent on the room service cart were cameras. <strong>So, they pulled back and waited for the approach of a full SWAT team</strong>. Keep in mind, this delay was not undue. It was purposeful and no shots were being <em>heard</em> by the suspect at this point. </p>

<p>Eventually, a plan was formulated. Entry was made. Suspect was seen laying on the ground. They encountered a closed bedroom door, which was locked, and they breached that door, and additionally found no other suspect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were 4 officers on <em>60 Minutes</em>: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Casey Clarkson (patrol)</p></li>
<li><p>Joshua Bitsko (K9)</p></li>
<li><p>Dave Newton (K9)</p></li>
<li><p>Matthew Donaldson (detective)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Casey Clarkson was not one of the responding officers. He never even entered the Mandalay Bay. His role on <em>60 Minutes</em> was as a stand-in for Levi Hancock. </p>

<p>This is all Casey said during the segment: </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><em>VOICEOVER INTRO: One week ago, just after 10 o&#39;clock at night, 22,000 people became targets at a country music concert. Las Vegas detective Casey Clarkson was among them.</em></p>

<p>CASEY CLARKSON: The fire just starts hitting us. And you just hear–</p>

<p>[BODY CAM: They are shooting right at us, guys, everyone stay down, stay down.]</p>

<p>CASEY CLARKSON: I just remember, like, it was, like– like, white spark, like, powder almost, like, hitting the concrete, hittin&#39; the van. I mean, I&#39;m just watching these rounds hit all, like, right next to us. And I&#39;m like, &quot;How is he so accurate?&quot;</p>

<p>BILL WHITAKER: Bullets just raining down on–</p>

<p>CASEY CLARKSON: –it&#39;s just raining down the whole time. And I just remember, I&#39;m like, I&#39;m just looking at my gun. I&#39;m just like, &quot;I got a pistol in my hand and this guy&#39;s shooting at me with an automatic rifle.&quot;</p>

<p>BILL WHITAKER: You got grazed. But you– you have shrapnel.</p>

<p>CASEY CLARKSON: Yeah, I got a piece of shrapnel in my neck. And I grabbed it for a second. And it was already just pouring blood, dripping off my hand and I was like, oh, my goodness. <strong>And I wanted to try to do more. But my partner was worried because I was getting light-headed at one point. &quot;And I said, &quot;You know what, I&#39;m just gonna stay</strong>, and I&#39;m gonna help as many people as I can.&quot;</p>

<p>BILL WHITAKER: Doing this while your neck is bleeding.</p>

<p>CASEY CLARKSON: Yes, sir.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>That &quot;interview&quot; was 100% PR – a celebration of the brave heroics of US law enforcement in the face of an active shooter. That particular 4-man makeshift strike team exemplified their intensive training and MACTAT protocol, and so that&#39;s the team they chose the highlight. When they couldn&#39;t get Levi on set, for whatever reason, they brought in one of the injured officers to sit in his place, because they really wanted to drive home the notion of a 4-man makeshift team. But the reality is, there were a lot more than 4 men (as evidenced by police scanner audio and LVMPD press conferences/statements), and there was a lot more that happened between them reaching the 32nd floor hallway and breaching the room, which wasn&#39;t covered in the segment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>LOMBARDO: I want to say kudos to those officers that got together and said, “This is what we trained for, active shooter. We are putting an element together. Let&#39;s go engage this individual and locate them.” Okay? And that&#39;s what we did. And when the security officer was engaged by the suspect, <strong>we backed off for immediate apprehension, and SWAT team formed and made entry</strong>. </p>

<p>REPORTER: So, Sheriff, Mandalay Bay security identified the room before SWAT arrived? </p>

<p>LOMBARDO: No. Well, yes, <strong>before SWAT arrived, but not before my officers arrived</strong>. They were married, or hand-in-hand, with my officers when we made entry over to the hotel. And it was a matter – if you will recall yesterday, I said between floor 29 and 32. And during that process of evaluating the floors, we received additional information where he was located, and they immediately responded. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>LOMBARDO: So we have found it&#39;s better instead of securing a perimeter and <em>hoping</em> the person doesn&#39;t continue to do acts of carnage associated with their actions, that even a small police response will stop the suspect&#39;s actions. And so what are– to answer your question in reference to the Mandalay Bay, that training, we were listening and we were paying attention. Officers, on their own, without direction of a supervisor, knew what they had to do. They came together, formed a team, made a response. And they didn&#39;t wait on SWAT, okay? They said “We have to stop.” It&#39;s easy to say “We’re waiting on SWAT, they’re our experts in tactical intrusion,” but our officers took it upon themselves to act. </p>

<p>REPORTER: <strong>So to clarify, patrol officers made entry into the room?</strong></p>

<p>LOMBARDO: <strong>No.</strong> Patrol officers evaluated floor by floor of the space between 29 and 32, where the suspect was. They formed the security, they evacuated rooms, and they formed the perimeter at the suspect&#39;s location. By unfortunate acts of the suspect, the security guard was engaged during that process. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SycnLVj6QaU">Tuesday 10/3 @6pm Press Conference</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>MCMAHILL: Another question that came up, how long was it before our SWAT team entered the suspect&#39;s room? Somebody said you heard that it was 72 minutes, and if why so long? As I just mentioned to you, and as the Sheriff mentioned previously in the briefing, <strong>we had patrol officers actually working another event at the Mandalay Bay who heard the shooting and they took it upon themselves to form up into a team, enter the stairwell, begin ascending the floors, and also evacuating hotel guests</strong>. <strong>The SWAT team had to arrive first at the Mandalay Bay before they could take action</strong>. </p>

So, imagine the elevator bank in the center, 150 feet down on a triplex hotel, was the suspect&#39;s room. So, there&#39;s several rooms along the way. Because no firing was occurring, they could not hear additional firing, they believed it was important to evacuate in case the suspect was barricaded. </p>

<p>While the first strike team did this, <strong>the second team made up of two K9 personnel, a SWAT officer, and patrol officers, navigated the numerous stairs wearing heavy tactical gear, carrying a large bag with tactical equipment, and holding rifles in order to have a closer position to the suspect&#39;s room</strong>. And that is within that stairwell and that doorway adjacent to the room I described previously. </p>

<p>They attempted to secure the front doorway of the suspect&#39;s room. But as they entered into the hallway, they could see the room service cart and readily apparent on the room service cart were cameras. <strong>So, they pulled back and waited for the approach of a full SWAT team</strong>. Keep in mind, this delay was not undue. It was purposeful and no shots were being <em>heard</em> by the suspect at this point. </p>

<p>Eventually, a plan was formulated. Entry was made. Suspect was seen laying on the ground. They encountered a closed bedroom door, which was locked, and they breached that door, and additionally found no other suspect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Campos, he called down to Security via cellphone, in order to free up the channel.</p>

<p>But then... why does Schuck feel the need to radio down to dispatch about the shooting, if Jesus, standing just a few feet away from him, is already on the phone with dispatch? </p>

<p>Why do the people Schuck is heard talking to in the audio recording seem to have no knowledge or details about the shooting? How come when they ask Schuck what room the shooter is in, he can&#39;t tell them, if Jesus is standing right next to him and knows exactly what room shots are coming from? </p>

<p>How come, every time the Sheriff references the security guard&#39;s call down to dispatch, he uses the word &quot;attempted&quot; (at least 3 separate times I&#39;ve counted so far)? He never says &quot;He radioed down,&quot; he always says &quot;He <em>attempted</em> to radio down.&quot; </p>

<p>How come the Sheriff has no timestamp of when Campos reported the shooting? </p>

<p>My guess is because Campos never actually/successfully radioed it in. </p>
