The only thing that this new &quot;leak&quot; proves is that Wikileaks is less trustworthy than what it appears and should be held to higher scrutiny when next release something.</p>

<p>The few articles I read on the subject paint Trump Jr. as totally neutral on this few replies back to Wikileaks requests. It&#39;s just a further burden on his credibility. He has been caught lying a number of times and talking with another dishonest party doesn&#39;t help his case.</p>

<p>Regarding the DNC fiasco, all courts that heard the case ruled that it&#39;s a private organisation making its own decisions. Since money was donated instead of given on a contract (even a verbal one), there is nothing the public can do legaly. The only person that might have a chance to sue the DNC successfully is Sanders himself , and only if he manages to prove that when he joined the party a fair election was promised to him.</p>

<p>But in this case that action consists of publishing documents that are negative to the Trump campaign.    The very act of underlying this was a commitment to neutrality.   It just follows that it would help them be viewed as impartial, which is true, and that more people would be reading the Podesta emails, which is also true. </p>

<p>Well that would be the opposite right? A document of this nature would be helpful to Hillary.  </p>

<p>he problem is that they ACTIVELY engaged in an action and solicited the cooperation of one of the two parties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To obtain tax returns and other negative information to publish.  It just so happens that publishing this information, would have helped wikileaks counter Clinton campaign smears, and it would have helped the Trump campaign because more people would read the Podesta emails, and it would have helped the electorate, as they would have had more information about a candidate.  Who knows what those documents would have shown.  Too bad they were not leaked. </p>

<p>They did not talked to a candidate.  Their twitter account sent messages soliciting information. In an attempt to rebuff the smears coming from the neo-liberal quarter. </p>

<p>Concerning the claim that all their information is anonymous, I will need to see a source for this. </p>

<p>They solicited information from the 3rd person in charge of his campaign. If you think this is functionally different from talking to a candidate directly, I don&#39;t know what to say to you to change your mind. And why did they sent a message to Trump Jr anyway? Did they sent one to the IRS chief or anyone else who might have had access to the tax returns about the same topic?</p>

<p>The documents are either authentic or not, when you find an inauthentic document, than let me know. </p>

<p>The only thing that is looking bad here is how the Clintonistas attempted to spin a story of wikileaks  attempting to get Tax returns and negative documents as somehow compromising their impartiality. </p>

<p>That would the deputy campaign manager right? That was not Trump Jr.  </p>

<p>Ok...</p>

<p>None of this is false.  They do receive information anonymously and through an anonymous submission platform. They also have people meet with leakers, like Craig Murray did with the Podesta leaks, and also have people turn in information through lawyers. </p>

<p>This is confirmed to have come from Wikileaks twitter account.  Whether they are attempting to “address the charge” is irrelevant.  It still amounts to curating leaks.  They don’t ask for the tax returns, they ask for the tax returns that were already reported on.  They’re not on a fact-finding mission, rather trying to cater to a Presidential candidate to earn favors.   </p>

<p>Wikileaks was referring to the partial 1995 return that was already leaked <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?referer=">here</a>.

<p>If we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality.   That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source.”    </p>

<p>We know it was used.  Wikileaks asks him to log on and comment on the name of the website owner.  Donald Trump Jr responds that he didn’t know that person, but will ask around.   </p>

<p>I see asking for leaking &quot;one or more&quot; of Trumps tax returns is really referring to a partial 1995 return. </p>

<p>The spin that you guys are trying to do here is really impressive. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To me, it appears they’re asking for returns that are in jeopardy of being leaked. Regardless, it still amounts to curating leaks:</p>

<p>The only curating of leaks that is occurring is what the Atlantic attempted to do. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is pretty clear to be coordinating leaks with a political party. Not necessarily a bad thing, it just catches both Trump and Wikileaks in a lie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no lie, it is an attempt to get negative information from a son of a presidential candidate.    It just so happens that, the Clinton campaign is smearing them as impartial, and publishing this type of information would counteract the smear.   That is true. It is also true that more people would go through the Podesta emails, and this would be helpful.  What is not known is the outcome that those leaked documents would have had. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well let us be exact here, I mean, you are literally criticizing wikileaks for attempting to get negative information on Trump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know it was used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t know that it was used, as the About section which lists the person, is not behind a password, and it wasn&#39;t in September of 2016.  You just jumped to a conclusion. </p>
