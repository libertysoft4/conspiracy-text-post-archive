        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know the first response I&#39;m going to get is that WikiLeaks pride themselves on being impartial, and yes this is true. But doesn&#39;t every media outlet claim to be impartial? Isn&#39;t that essentially the goal of journalism anyways, even though it&#39;s not really the case anymore? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too much of a stretch to assume that Assange was adamantly opposed to a Clinton presidency, seeing as how she thinks he should be killed via drone strike and her winning would probably be a greater threat to his freedom and life than a Trump win. But the content of the messages that were released today don&#39;t indicate to me that there was anything nefarious going on between WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign. If anything, it proves that they weren&#39;t in contact as much as the MSM has insinuated over the past year. </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m just missing something but this doesn&#39;t seem like the bombshell people are making it out to be. </p>

<p>And for those who might have forgotten, <a href="http://www.ronpaullibertyreport.com/archives/revealed-the-real-fake-news-list">here&#39;s a link with names of all of the reporters the Clinton Campaign is confirmed to have worked with.</a></p>
