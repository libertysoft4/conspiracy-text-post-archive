<p>Transsexuals are mentally ill and play make believe and think they can change their sex via &quot;sex reassignment surgery&quot; and then literally pretend they are a different gender, worse is they then force this mental illness on the rest of us.</p>

<p>I only asked about one type of intersex person. There  are a full spectrum of intersex people, thus making it impossible to say there is only one gender.</p>

<p>All it takes is one example of someone being XXY to disprove the statement that there is only one gender. Yet, there are millions of such examples and the more we learn about human genetics the more diversity we find.</p>

<p>Science is not marching backward.</p>

<p>If you met someone with two X chromosomes and a penis would you call them a man or a woman?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Public policy isn&#39;t part of our discussion here.

Same sex marriage is a great example of this.</p>

<p>Science is very helpful for us to discern fact from fiction.</p>

<p>Your hypothesis is that there are only two genders. This can easily be tested by looking at our genetic makeup. If we find even one example of someone that is gender ambiguous, this disproves the hypothesis. Since we know there are millions of such examples, we must move on and create a new hypothesis to test.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I see the concern -- allowing children under the age of consent to make decisions about gender is not rational.</p>

<p>So to constrain the question, do you think your children, once they have reached the age of consent, would make that decision?  And if they did, would you have the right to prevent that?  Even if you felt it was bad for them?</p>

<p>These mentally ill people then end up taking there own life because instead of getting help for there mental heath, some other mentally ill person convinced them to get invasive surgery, only to realize after the fact they can not change there sex or gender.</p>

<p>That is where you are wrong, the Rate of suicide and attempted suicides on average in the US is 4.6 percent of the overall U.S. population, in comparison to 41 percent of &quot;transsexuals&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to use the term mentally ill very freely and yeah obviously pedophiles are mentally ill which is why I didn&#39;t say anything about that. </p>

<p>2 issues I have with that statistic,
1.) The population difference between those two groups of people are drastically different 
2.) People who change genders are certainly seen as having issues by the vast majority of people which will cause serious self esteem issues which only adds to whatever that have dealt with in their life to make them take that step to change gender. </p>

<p>Maybe the suicide rate wouldn&#39;t be so high if people like you stopped calling them mentally ill and allowed them to live their life how they want to. I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t care what decisions you make in life so why should you care about theirs? If you weren&#39;t so quick to think that they&#39;re totally insane maybe you could find that at least some of them are just people, just like you and I. </p>

<p>Basic genetics my friend.</p>

<p>Humans normally have 46 chromosomes, which come in 23 pairs, as well as some mitochondrial DNA. From the mitochondrial DNA, and 22 of the 23 other chromosome pairs, there is nothing to tell you whether the DNA came from a male or a female. The genetic difference between males and females resides in that last chromosome pair, the sex chromosomes. At the sex chromosomes, women have two X chromosomes, while men have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.</p>

<p>This is what &quot;transsexuals&quot; claim, but we should obviously reject this statement as it is being said by someone who is mentally ill.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is perfectly fine, put on a dress and a wig and play make believe, the problem is they are projecting their mental illness on the rest of society and trying to blame normal people for what they are thinking.</p>

<p>So congratulations. You are making it more difficult by angrily trying to justify for others that have a physical dysmorphia by using people with actual defects.  </p>

<p>Your logic is sloppy and careless and will result in a destruction of morals of society.  </p>

<p>Sorry. You&#39;re wrong and will always be wrong because you want to break physical objective reality with your mind.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you’re talking shit on people that you have nothing to do with... why do you care if someone wants to change genders? Why do you care if someone wants to replace their penis with a vagina and call themselves a girl... seriously it has no effect on your life unless you let it. </p>

<p>Btw we live in a society where the richest people steal from us on a daily basis and literally pay for people to go out and incite arguments that are meant to divide us over issues like this that you have nothing to do with...</p>

<p>You honestly seem like a paid shill. How selfish can you be that you would go out of your way to shame these people? How have they affected you so personally? Why do you hold the opinion that its immoral to wear girls clothes and pretend to be a chick?! You realize all the celebrities and politicians out there are fucking little boys right?! Actual, real, physical abuse... </p>

<p>And you’re over here talking about how two consenting adult trannys are perverse?! </p>

<p>You are the distraction. You are the shill here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has a huge effect on my life.  How dare you imply that I should sit back and do nothing while people are protesting for rights that they argue they don&#39;t have because they bring up arguments with people that don&#39;t want them to be catered to. </p>

<p>Screw you and your complete unawareness.  </p>

<p>They are changing a lot of things about society and stand as victims by phrasing and interacting with everything AS A VICTIM.  </p>

<p>Funny how that works out. I&#39;m not going to let people have conversations and push people around because they want &quot;acceptance&quot; by being as decisive as possible. </p>

<p>Screw that energy and the deception needed to logically convince someone that any of it is okay is astonishing.  </p>

<p>Your failure to join the many mechanisms of society is no fault of mine.  You laid out assumptions that I didn&#39;t even make.  Seems like you are building me into your opponent. </p>

<p>The transgender funded movement is going to have devastating effects on this country for everyone.  It&#39;s the same slow sick confusion that has been occurring to take away confidence in the gender than isn&#39;t afraid to stand up to tyranny that you mention so tangentially.  </p>

<p>If you want to discuss trans then let&#39;s do it.  It&#39;s hard to maintain a conversation if you&#39;re all over the place in attempting to flame me. </p>

<p>You are so blind to the effects of the trans movement if you aren&#39;t seeing children with identity crisis, post op depression, sexual deviancy from women, feminized men. </p>

<p>Love your culture or hate it, it exists and grows much to the detriment of society due to infighting and bickering caused from emotional instability. </p>

<p>I&#39;m on the outside watching in and watching the entire cancerous inverted fascist socialist creation blowing up in the face of everyone thinking they understand it.  </p>

<p>Good luck to you.  </p>

<p>We can&#39;t have a system that takes care of everyone individually when there are much more important needs for the many.  </p>

<p>This world works in mass majority and there is a huge attempt at giving power and law making abilities to the underdogs that want to enslave the majority rule that has been occurring. </p>

<p>Now with technology available people can isolate and single out anyone opposed to their view and we are seeing a pooling of ideologies that wants t available before and it is attacking the status quo. </p>

<p>You people all see the status quo as something that needs to be attacked instead of turning your focus onto what you&#39;ve been doing wrong with your perspective that gives you a never ending enemy. </p>

<p>The answer lies in the people with the problem.  Society is tough. It it&#39;s because life doesn&#39;t cater to every aspect of personality and it&#39;s a part of the growth. </p>

<p>Asking the world to. End over for every nuance is ridiculous and a person like that should have a safe space where they can create their own reality.  </p>

<p>My point was that transexuals should not be compared to pedophiles...</p>

<p>Its like comparing someones PTSD(a mental illness) to pedophilia... wouldn’t that be a bit shitty if you had PTSD and someone tried to say “listening to the opinion about PTSD from someone who has PTSD is like listening to a pedophiles opinion about pedophilia”??</p>

<p>The end goal of these conversations shouldn’t be to “win” or “lose”. It should be sharing ideas, sharing experiences, listening, empathizing, and letting each other have our own opinions as long as they aren’t directly harming anyone. </p>

<p>I’m not trying to have the debate about whether or not transexuals are mentally ill or not or whether or not they are a harm to society or cause physical abuse and harm to others... if you are, you can have that discussion with someone else. </p>

<p>Again, my point was that transexuals should not be compared to pedophiles...</p>

<p>I feel like thats a valid and fair opinion to have especially when I’m not pushing it on anybody.... all I was doing was trying to defend the transexual community that has been nothing but kind to me, from an unfair comparison. </p>

<p>Humans normally have 46 chromosomes, which come in 23 pairs, as well as some mitochondrial DNA. From the mitochondrial DNA, and 22 of the 23 other chromosome pairs, there is nothing to tell you whether the DNA came from a male or a female. The genetic difference between males and females resides in that last chromosome pair, the sex chromosomes. At the sex chromosomes, women have two X chromosomes, while men have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.</p>

<p>Ok, well, you&#39;re original statement was that we shouldn&#39;t listen to their opinions.  Taking advice is different.  For example, I would be interested in hearing from an intelligent schizophrenic about what that is like in order to understand the basal nature of consciousness, although I wouldn&#39;t necessarily take their advice as how to respond to voices in ones head.</p>

<p>So too with a transgender person, I would not be interested in their fashion advice, but would certainly be interested in hearing how they view the distinction between genders.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Not really. There are critical periods during fetal development where genital and neurological sexual differentiation is governed by hormones released by the mother. If such is interrupted the fetus will not properly develop into one or the other sex. The result is usually a male with defective genitalia and a brain that is more female than male. There is also the reverse case where a genetic female is subjected to masculinizing hormones which may result in a sterile female with male characteristics.</p>

<p>But you do have a point. While the number of cases of incomplete sexual dimorphism is on the rise due to industrial chemicals mimicking hormones, the sheer number of supposed cases is hard to swallow. Boys have always played with dolls for instance, but that is usually temporary. Early on, sex-specific toy preferences take hold. We can talk about &quot;action-figures&quot; being doll-play, but boys tend to use those dolls to mimic aggression, not nurturing. That being said, a tendency towards opposite-sex preferences is not, and should never be, a diagnostic for being in the wrong body.</p>

<p>According to the Kinsey report, the majority of people are neither exclusively homo or hetero sexual. Most of us are in that grey area and show preferences for typical same-sex versus opposite-sex behaviours to varying degrees. Once again, not a diagnostic for incomplete dimorphism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This how I see it.</p>

<p>There are Two genders and Three orientations. The orientations are male, female, and &#39;other.&#39;  I&#39;m sure everyone will agree in male and female. But other is different than what we would think of as an orientation. Other is identifying and orienting yourself through the Other sex. So a person born male can be orientated through a female perspective. Vice versa. It&#39;s an actual part of the scheme of this world. People aren&#39;t mentally ill because they are Other. Identifying with the other gender has deeper reasons and it has to do with the psyche and the soul.</p>

<p>As far as what kind of sexual interaction you like that is preference, not orientation.</p>

<p>Pedophiles have a sexual hangup on their own exposure to being abused or having exposure to sex at a very early age in some capacity with an adult.  So it&#39;s no different when a doctor is doing this to a child to mess with their sexuality . It&#39;s still abuse in my eyes. A child can express themselves as other without having to have their physiology restructured. I think that is terribly abusive and parents who love their kids and thinks it&#39;s the best for them need to think of long term. That&#39;s the child&#39;s whole life. Let the child grow into themselves without that and let them make these choices later in life because what&#39;s en vogue now won&#39;t even be necessary in a world where the child can be other without being forced into that appearance to be accepted.</p>

It&#39;s scary how women in particular fall for this crap, a lot of women argue for anything they think had to do with letting people freely express themselves. To me this transgender shit has just developed organically in America, they&#39;ve been dolling their kids up in pagents and loading them with drugs and snipping their cocks in half, teaching them racism and violence and making them so fat they can&#39;t think properly - those people defending the right for someone to pick their gender when they get bored with it just makes sense when you look at the big picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, I don&#39;t agree with your whole argument, and I know &quot;true&quot; trans folks, but yes, this new wave vogue trans shit is people with personality disorders who think being trans will fix it, while simultaneously getting them victim/hero status. It&#39;s not popular to say in the queer community, but there&#39;s some new young things who have no sense of history, respect or the spiritual side of the two-spirits. In some cultures, they were the shamans. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched a friend allow his son to appear feminine for years, no hormones, and now the kid is definitely hitting puberty (and wants to use his penis) and identify as male. I&#39;ve found it repulsive that he has used it for attention and a badge to show how open-minded he is. That&#39;s completely different from another friend&#39;s experience of her son coming out to her at 3 and having to immerse herself in the queer scene to find information and support. She&#39;s not convinced about hormones and I sure as fuck never will be. For anyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew this post would bring out the SJWs arguing that sex and gender aren&#39;t the same. 
Gender isn&#39;t a social construct.  You are either a male or female, nothing more nothing less (unless you are intersex - rare) 
The LGBTQSGDTDJ community have been infiltrated by those with a sick agenda.  The agenda is to warp our kids minds from an early age about sexuality and gender.   Kids have no reason to learn about this shit - yet it is pushed really hard.  Transgender kids are part of their plan to destroy traditional values and strip everyone of their true identity.  They want people to be feeling confused and deluded about what sex they are. 
I&#39;ll repeat it just to be an arse: there are two genders. Male and female.  Penis and vagina. XX and XY.  that&#39;s biology and there&#39;s no arguing with it. </p>

<p>Hopefully in a few years this gender politics will be over. </p>

<p>It is entirely possible to have two X chromosomes and have a penis. It is also entirely possible to have X and Y chromosomes and have a vagina. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless an individual is XY but has androgen insensitivity, and thus biologically develops all the female secondary characteristics while having internal testes, and no one might even notice until they look into why the girl never got her period.</p>

<p>Or you can easily have chimerism or mosaicism which means you have some organs or cells of a different set of genes in you. Like the man who had an ovary inside him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait what did you win exactly?</p>

<p>My point was that transexuals should not be compared to pedophiles...</p>

<p>Its like comparing someones PTSD(a mental illness) to pedophilia... wouldn’t that be a bit shitty if you had PTSD and someone tried to say “listening to the opinion about PTSD from someone who has PTSD is like listening to a pedophiles opinion about pedophilia”??</p>

<p>The end goal of these conversations shouldn’t be to “win” or “lose”. It should be sharing ideas, sharing experiences, listening, empathizing, and letting each other have our own opinions as long as they aren’t directly harming anyone. </p>

<p>I’m not trying to have the debate about whether or not transexuals are mentally ill or not or whether or not they are a harm to society or cause physical abuse and harm to others... if you are, you can have that discussion with someone else. </p>

<p>Again, my point was that transexuals should not be compared to pedophiles...</p>

<p>I feel like thats a valid and fair opinion to have especially when I’m not pushing it on anybody.... all I was doing was trying to defend the transexual community that has been nothing but kind to me, from an unfair comparison. </p>
