<p>The charger thing is annoying. Can they fuck with the charge on your phone somehow? Anyone else ever experienced this? </p>

<p>The CIA can potentially take control of your car while you&#39;re driving it(if it&#39;s a newer model), correct? Is t that how Michael Hastings may have been murdered? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>To cater advertisements to me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that&#39;s one aspect only. they are also creating &quot;digital profiles&quot; on you, creating a highly sophisticated profile that can predict some scary things about, including even predicting who you know, will know, or did know, your travel plans, your health and diet, and all your political leanings.</p>

<p>these profiles are the information that is being sold, not the raw data. or sometimes the raw data is sold to companies that generate these profiles, and then passed on to other companies.</p>

<p>most common use is for advertising. but what else will they start to do with that info in the future?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So can the Chinese and the Russians and the British and anyone else who has world class hackers working for them.</p>

<p>I am like, 99.99% cetain that is not what is happening to you. Probably just got a lemon of a phone. If the CIA wanted to stop you from leaking info, like for real, you wouldn&#39;t be posting about it online. you&#39;d be dead or in a mental institution.</p>

<p>I doubt a significant percentage of developers really care to track users to be quite honest (and this is coming from the lead developer of a medium-sized projects with about 20K monthly users). That&#39;s not to say that there are those that do, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s weird cause chargers stopped working in my phone too. I had to buy that thing where it plugs into the wall and you charge the battery directly, and i switch between two batteries.</p>

<p>Also I noticed when I browse this sub or other related stuffon my phone, pop up ads come up that you can&#39;t back out of and makes you restart your browser. Wtf</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably off topic but 
Back when I was right out of high school (2003ish dial up or dsl I forget ) my computer would turn it self on.  This happened mostly if I left the house with the whole family. I&#39;d come back to pc being on. I got paranoid and set up easy things I could check to see if anyone had entered my room. But none ever showed it. Finally I got fed up and left a note on my screen when going out that said for whoever it was to stop messing with my computer. It never turned on by it self after that. I&#39;ve had other weird shit happen too but I&#39;d assume everyone does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Can they fuck with the charge on your phone somehow?&quot;</p>

<p>It is impossible for others to listen in on your phone, or document every person you have contacted. just kidding.</p>

<p>Last night, I missed a call. When I returned the call, it went to a voicemail from a cemetery. when I looked up the number, it said it belonged to a man named Baltazar Garcia. Not a funny prank. Quite scary, actually.</p>

<p>Sad to say that many children and teens are monitored through their phones. Many explicit pictures have been confiscated, and teens have been threatened with assault charges. Communities encourage it. The people encouraging, then watching should be prosecuted for sexual assault and stalking.
