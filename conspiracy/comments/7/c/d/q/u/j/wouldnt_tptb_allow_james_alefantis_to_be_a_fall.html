<p>I would personally have Alefantis be the fall guy to take all this heat, since he&#39;s just some &quot;friendly pizza parlor owner&quot;, but for some reason they are using the MSM (60 minutes, Fox News,) to protect this guy. Why? </p>

<p>That is preposterous, America isn&#39;t in the situation that gave Hitler the opportunity to take over Germany. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is asinine given the fact that Hitler seized all of Rothschild&#39;s asset in Germany. If it wouldn&#39;t be for Hitler the Rothschild&#39;s would be way more richer than they actually are. He <a href="https://archive.org/stream/HowHitlerDefiedTheInternationalBankers/HowHitlerDefiedTheBankers_djvu.txt">defied the Rothschild&#39;s more than once</a>. That doesn&#39;t make him good of course not, but being evil doesn&#39;t make you a Rothschild like you seem to ratiocinate. </p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;ve done my research, but it appears the only source of information you trust is Infowars. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t consider Infowars as a veracious source of knowledge

<p>And contrary to you I showed up proofs, what about you? Nothing more than emotionally driven cogitations and incongruous ideas. </p>

<p>The Warburgs and Morgans along with any number of others who helped finance Hitler were fronts for the Rothschilds who were also heavily invested in numerous major US corporations with branch operations in Germany that all assisted and profited from Hitler&#39;s rise to power and military build-up and the Rothchilds are notorious for playing both side of the street in order to lay their hands on the spoils of war no matter which side wins that goes right back to their very beginnings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not view that&#39;s grotesque, it&#39;s a world that very much has such grotesque elements in it&#39;s history and only a fool would choose to ignore them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes exactly. That&#39;s exactly the point. Why was JA named as 49th most powerful person in Washington when he&#39;s only a pizza restaurant owner? It makes no sense. And that means that he isn&#39;t just a pizza restaurant owner. He&#39;s something else, someone worth protecting or someone who has an enormous amount of knowledge and leverage - someone who has said &#39;if I go down then I&#39;ve arranged it so that all this info and evidence I have on all of you gets out and you all go down too&#39; or he is secretly somehow higher up in their weird cult hierarchy than many of the public faces. </p>

<p>If you want to secretly control the world from behind the scenes then it makes sense to have your expendable public puppets be the face of your power, so that if they go down for whatever reason, you can maintain your power by just installing a new puppet in their place. Everyone thinks the corrupt person has been dealt with and there&#39;s a fresh face in their place who will change things and be different and do a better job. When in reality the same exact people are still there, behind the scenes, calling the shots. JA could be one of these people. Or he just has a lot of leverage in the form of blackmail material.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean there are no victims? Have you not seen the statistics on human/child trafficking both globally and in the US? There are victims, the question has always been who are the perpetrators? Given that victims in these situations are not likely to come forward - think abotu how long it took for Weinstein&#39;s victims to come forward, and they were women of some means and he was simply a powerful Hollywood mogul - imagine being some street kid who was kidnapped and sold into slavery and to come forward about what&#39;s ahppened to you and the people who did it means you&#39;re going up against a global criminal empire that has intelligence agencies, powerful politicians and billionaires on its payroll? Knowing there are people like you, who will dismiss and laugh at them and call them crazy?</p>

<p>We know there are victims and we know why many of them don&#39;t come forward to identify their tormentors. We also do have several whistleblowers who talk about these trafficking operations and the involvement of the &#39;global elite.&#39; SO how do we identify the nodes of these operations and the businesses they hide behind?</p>

<p>For an answer to that question, I refer you to the pizzagate investigation. You can keep trying to convince yourself and others that it&#39;s all just complete coincidence, that none of these things are connected, that all the associations to pedophilia and abuse and occult practices are misunderstandings, each of the references is independently a bizarre chance mistake that happens to give an impression of pedophilic activity and that it is one more big giant coincidence that all of these independent bizarre chance mistakes indicating pedophilia all happen to relate to the same group of people, to a group of businesses that happen to be all located on one street, but you&#39;re fooling yourself. It is a statistical impossibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s look at this with a bit more substance, shall we? </p>

<p>First: JA could very well be totally and 100% innocent. He could operate an amazing pizza joint in DC, and it could happen to just be a cool place that attracts some political events on occasion. Along with hosting somewhat edgy musical gigs. </p>

<p>Now that this is out of the way... let&#39;s look at data points. Not assumptions. But things that need to be brought back into focus:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There was an alleged email/Reddit conversation where a former employer accused him of assault: <a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@abortionburger/victim-comes-forward-i-was-sexually-assaulted-by-james-alefantis">https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@abortionburger/victim-comes-forward-i-was-sexually-assaulted-by-james-alefantis</a></p></li>
<li><p>Multiple property listings, including Pegasus &amp; Transformer (With the death threats issued/reported once Pegasus was implicated)</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of strange musical guests, most notably: Heavy Breathing... (Majestic Ape) (All ages shows, starting at 11 pm?) - and Sex Stains? (With a music video that has the same symbol seen in the Besta Pizza logo/FBI Doc) <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IXZY4-V5OIo/maxresdefault.jpg">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IXZY4-V5OIo/maxresdefault.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>Ben Swann&#39;s piece on PG: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GZFHLAcG8A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GZFHLAcG8A</a></p></li>
<li><p>Connections to high-end art trafficking (Arts &amp; Embassies)</p></li>
<li><p>The pizza PAC/Invitations from Podesta&#39;s emails</p></li>
<li><p>The CPP website backdoor page w/ the login and password blocked feature, which was allegedly hacked and sent to multiple LEOs... which is potentially being reinvestigated right now</p></li>
<li><p>The deeply disturbing social media imagery/links/comments: <a href="https://steemit.com/personsofinterest/@ausbitbank/persons-of-interest-james-achilles-alefantis-aka-jimmycomet-at-comet-ping-pong">https://steemit.com/personsofinterest/@ausbitbank/persons-of-interest-james-achilles-alefantis-aka-jimmycomet-at-comet-ping-pong</a> (Also provides many more links/images/concerning info)</p></li>
<li><p>The direct connections to Podesta brothers, Abramovich, Clinton and Soros</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So... in summary, this could all be a coincidence. But, seriously?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, the fact that his YELP! page had consistently bad reviews before the MSM coordinated effort to bury this. After the media started their little campaign, CPP&#39;s reviews suddenly got flooded with positive reviews. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1532877">There was a Voat post on this.</a></p>

<p>Some of the negative reviews pre-Pizzagate:</p>

<p>&quot; My fiance and I went here the other night for dinner. I was a little thrown off by the amount of children in the restaurant...I guess my impression was it was more a bar than a restaurant and didn&#39;t realize how close to DC suburbia it was. The ping pong area was pretty much all kids so we didn&#39;t get a chance to check it out. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Every time I&#39;ve gone, the ping pong area has been infested with children (even fairly late into the evening and then they take the tables down for live music) so I&#39;ve never gotten to play in all 3 times I&#39;ve been there. I really wish they&#39;d do something to discourage parents from bringing their kids since it really is more of a bar atmosphere otherwise, and the shows are usually punk rock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Additionally, the restaurant seems to have grown grubbier over time. On our last visit (meaning both the most recent - and the last time we plan to eat here), the restrooms were gross - skeevy gas station bathroom level. And it wasn&#39;t just the can; the wall next to our table was splattered with dried food and drink.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad we sat outside because after we ate, we decided to go in to check out the atmosphere and ping pong tables (hopefully try to play a game), but there were children running around EVERYWHERE!! It seemed as though there were 50 children.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; We came to eat here following multiple recommendations and were so disappointed - the pizza is simply not good. The worst we had in DC. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The service was horrid. No silverware, no napkins without asking, no refills, and every employee it looked wore whatever they wanted and were all chatting with each other instead if working. I also overheard the person next to me complain about the service.&quot;</p>

<p>&#39; Josh was a very rude bar tender. He held hostage hospitable services from the customer - a policy that disgusts me and if indicative of the rest of Comet bar staff I cannot recommend this establishment. Also when I told Josh I&#39;d write this review he said &quot;Fucking do it. Nobody fucking reads Yelp reviews anyways.&quot; &#39;</p>

<p>The Warburgs and Morgans along with any number of others who helped finance Hitler were fronts for the Rothschilds who were also heavily invested in numerous major US corporations with branch operations in Germany that all assisted and profited from Hitler&#39;s rise to power and military build-up and the Rothchilds are notorious for playing both side of the street in order to lay their hands on the spoils of war no matter which side wins that goes right back to their very beginnings.</p>
