    <div class="md"><p>I understand that you are trying to fit your answer to my definition of evidence. But the problem with that is that my definition of evidence does not matter. Evidence is simply a fact that supports a certain claim.

<p>I have yet to see any argument from OP.</p>

<p>If I asked you to provide me &quot;hard verifiable information that has 0 disclaimers about it&#39;s vericity and clearly shows both that OJ Simpson killed his wife and why it was OJ Simpson that killed his ex-wife,&quot; you couldn&#39;t do it.  There is no piece of evidence that proves conclusively that OJ killed his wife.  And a lot of that evidence is based on trust of government experts -- you <em>say</em> blood with OJ&#39;s DNA was found at the scene, but maybe the cops or the crime lab is lying.</p>

<p>Would you therefore say, &quot;there is no evidence OJ Simpson killed his ex-wife&quot;?</p>

<p>The dates of transfer complete are the last transfer before zipping, so if the files were hacked over the internet, than transfered to/from a USB drive and than zipped it the result would be the same. Asked about this, his response was why would try do this.</p>

<p>His second assumption is that each file transfer began when the last ended. There were minutes of no transfer before the file immediately before the multiple GB file that is used for calculation. If a hacker performed multiple downloads, getting the earlier smaller file while the large one was already transferring it could duplicate the resulting dates.</p>

<p>It really is difficult to pin the culprit without wikileaks providing evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Local, state and federal agencies have conducted little of the type of digital forensic investigation required to assess the impact, if any, on voting in <strong>at least 21 states whose election systems were targeted by Russian hackers</strong>, according to interviews with nearly two dozen national security and state officials and election technology specialists.</p>

<p>The issue is not that they systems were not attacked, the issue is that the election officials are not investigating. </p>

An article on Sept. 2 about investigations into election tampering in several states referred incorrectly to problems with voter rolls in three North Carolina counties that included the cities of Raleigh, Winston-Salem and Charlotte. The problems involved paper rolls, not e-poll books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t get how you didn&#39;t see the massive backtrack on that claim in the week following, when the states that DHS said were hacked said that DHS was wrong and they hadn&#39;t been hacked. Talk about living in a filter bubble!</p>

<p>This whole thing then quickly fell out of the media spotlight. So ask yourself what&#39;s really going on here? DHS put this out deliberately knowing it would make people think Russians hacked the election, knowing the media would sensationalise it and report in such a way that people would assume Russia hacked the election and that when the truth was revealed most mainsream outlets would barely cover that error. Why? Because they want you to think the election was illegitimate, they want you to be primed to believe that any news that they don&#39;t want you to believe  is actually false and planted by Russians. It&#39;s all lies. Have a look at your own echo chamber and ensure you are getting your information from multiple diverse sources.</p>

<p>Mueller needs up to a full year or more to do his investigation. He only started in May of 2017. Probably by that time in 2018 or a couple months after will his investigation conclude.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that people only bring up the fact that the investigation isn&#39;t complete yet, urging us all to just wait and see, in response to people calling out the lack of evidence -- never in response to people jumping to conclusions based on imaginary evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the investigation started in May, they&#39;ve had six months. Everyone got excited about the 30+ sealed indictments thinking Podesta or Hillary went down, but we won&#39;t know until there&#39;s a conviction.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the guy who worked on the Trump campaign that plead guilty to lying about meeting with multiple Russian agents trying to setup a meeting between Trump and Putin <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4163414/Papadopoulos-Statement-Offense.pdf%C2%A0">https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4163414/Papadopoulos-Statement-Offense.pdf </a> I would hardly call that imaginary.</p>

<p>The investigation isn&#39;t about Russian hacking, it&#39;s looking into Russia&#39;s involvement, and one head has already rolled for lying about their attempts to bring Trump and Putin together, in less than <em>6 months</em>. </p>

<p>Yes, I say let&#39;s wait to see what all those sealed indictments will reveal. I don&#39;t care what side gets shafted, I just want to see criminals go to jail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone notice it&#39;s strange the media isn&#39;t trying to interview Julian Assange, who was the guy who actually released all the emails that this whole investigation revolves around? They know what we all know, and he has stated it wasn&#39;t the Russians. He&#39;s done more to hint at Seth Rich than anything, and it seems the evidence is pointing to the info being leaked more than hacking by Russians. </p>

<p>Plus there was this that came out before the election. This is interesting if you haven&#39;t seen it, CIA guy talking about how military intel community was releasing info to wikileaks to prevent Clinton from becoming president:</p>

<p>It was only an hour however it felt like a year each time she came back and told us the big reveal was seconds away...</p>

<p>well, what we finally found out was the tax returns were from 2005 and he actually paid a shit ton in taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are they supposed to do? When the Seth Rich thing comes out it will be really bad for them. The kid was murdered, irrespective of what happened people will believe it was the DNC. </p>

<p>The CIA director just met former NSA guy William Binney, on the President&#39;s behest. He will have presented him the evidence that the official story is a technical impossibility. Meaning the intelligence agencies have fabricated this story to unseat a President. The implications here are enormous. </p>
