<p>Now think about how many people must&#39;ve been down on the strip during the chaos.  If there were hundreds of ppl getting gunned down anywhere on the strip, the entire downtown area would be on alert.  This involves a large portion of people whipping out their cell phone to record the situation!  It&#39;s obvious when you think about it!  <a href="http://i.imgs.fyi/img/1k35.png">Here is a very clearly laid out reason why this raises a huge red flag.</a></p>

<p>Guys, this is way too massive for them to cover up.  They are brigading this subreddit constantly, harder than ever before.  What they don&#39;t know yet, is they CANT WIN; sad to see them try so hard though...</p>

<p>There were absolutely multiple shooters.  No doubt, ONE.HUNDRED.PERCENT.  Ignore Paddock, he is just a patsy that is taking the focus of this enormous charade that cost the lives of innocent civilians just like us.</p>

<p><strong>To all the shills reading this: start working on updating your resume, you&#39;ll be out of that terrible fucking job by next week! LOL</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are starting to. All this time they refused to cooperate on a massive scale because they felt that there no reward in it. Also, Hollywood uses brainwashing systems to trick us into thinking an every man for himself society is optimal. Capatalism does that to us to. However, the world has degenerated to such a horrible place that the people are being forced to team up to fix it or else continue with decades of massive suffering. The pain forced us into cooperating. We just upped our game in 2016 and all that effort will bear fruit as heavyweight cabal members fall apart and their entire empire crumbles leaving us a black slate to build upon. At that point, the people will truly realize the magic behind cooperation. Later, when we march into the golden age, cooperation will fully be understood and will become a respected social construct that is later taught to children in school. People will push cooperation to it  limits to better understand it. Once the rewards start rolling in, people will understand this. We will be sad that we didn’t think of this earlier and marvel at how we missed something so obviously beneficial. </p>

What do they want right now? Someone not beholden to outside money as president. That&#39;s how he won. What&#39;s he get of it? Glory to his name, which he&#39;s always been obsessed with, and oh yeah his kids might just be able to live in an America that doesn&#39;t resemble Brazil where they might actually have an opportunity to enjoy the wealth he&#39;s spent a lifetime building. </p>

<p>Too many have no clue we don&#39;t live in a capitalistic system and haven&#39;t for like 100 years at least.

<p>This is precisely what has happened. </p>

<p>They are hiding so much of our resources and technology, that if the people found out, we would go in there and kill them with our bare hands. The reason they hide it is because holding onto it gives them more power. 2 examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They claim supply is low to jack up prices to points where everything is barely affordable for most. This is why people are hungry. They can’t afford to consume. Prices are artificially high. </p></li>
<li><p>They only release technology when it’s a must. When they do, they create a company where they put a corporate stooge at the top selling very old tech the cabal has been hoarding from 50 years ago. They tell you they built this tech in a garage but that’s just a cover story. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Theres a lot to explain but sacred economics, if done properly with the proper laws and worldwide, would lead to an insanely wealthy planet where people share everything, there is more than enough to go around, and people work their passions. </p>

<p>The central problem is the insistence on victimhood.  The cabal are other people who have done evil things to us, but we only need to appoint the right governmental parent, and then they will only do good things for us, and change our nappies when we need it, and make sure that we have a warm bottle, that we can go back to mindlessly watching cat videos with the assurance that everything will be fine.</p>

<p>People need to stop wanting to put another parental organisation into power so that they can go back to sleep, and instead take permanent responsibility for themselves.</p>

<p>No thanks.  I&#39;ve had enough Utopianism to last me for the rest of my life at this point.  I don&#39;t mind co-operating with people online, but I&#39;m not going to delude myself that that by itself will create a better society.</p>

<p>If Utopia hypothetically ever was going to exist, there would be literally no form of centralised government at all, and if the psychopathic minority tried to trick us into having one, the attempt would be recognised and rejected immediately.</p>

<p>Again, co-operation is fine, but I don&#39;t want &quot;unity.&quot;  All centralised political unity means is that the rest of us have psychopaths making our most important life decisions.  Co-operation needs to be able to start and stop whenever it is necessary, and people must likewise be entirely free to join new groups and leave old ones at any time.                      </p>

<p>You see blood coming from his mouth. That doesn&#39;t mean he was shot in the mouth. Easy assumption to make though. After seeing the picture I thought the same thing. But it makes sense that he&#39;ll have massive internal bleeding from a shot in the chest too, which will come out of his mouth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay... But where is the photo that shows a chest wound?  Am I to believe that blood coming from his mouth as the result of putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger is more far fetched than him being shot in the chest and he coughs up blood from his lungs... without any evidence being presented to show a chest wound? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s another picture that shows a chest wound. Just saying that the pic we do have (blood coming from mouth) is not inconsistent with a chest wound.</p>

<p>Of course it could be a shot in the mouth too. It&#39;s not far fetched to think that. Like I said, when I saw the picture for the first time I just assumed he put a gun in his mouth too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically people just made up the chest wound to fit a narrative of someone else in the room that killed him without any real evidence... Great. This really is r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>I suppose a chest wound would also be more likely to partially blow out his left eyeball than a bullet traveling through the back of his head? </p>

<p>Could you explain how they were proven false? AFIK it hasn&#39;t been debunked yet other than you claiming it. </p>

<p>However if it is debunked, the fact that false reports were circulating en mass is very concerning. At the same time a lot of these reports are form social media from people who were there. 
I understand confusion and fog of war to happen but there&#39;s too many reports of other shootings, one even apparently 30 mins after the official one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there is little info to go on but the police tapes are good. In each case the operator broadcasts a report of a shooting and checks in the CP with a phone call confirmation with the hotel staff and in each case a team reports in with eyewitness interviews or by a clearing sweep. Now you can argue they were all acting but it all sounded like real comm traffic. We do not have any transcripts or audio from any of the secure swat or fbi lines only the police net and it sounded legit. </p>

<p>I do have military background and spent a lot of time on radios and the traffic on that net was very professional and good. It was chaotic early with confused reports of shooter location and number of suspects but as the event progressed they zeroed in on the 29th and 32nd floor. Put a team on 32 waited for swat. Swat started sweeping from 29 up while evacuating guests as they went. It was by the book. The team on 32 evacuated guests and waited for 29/30/31 to be cleared. </p>

<p>The biggest issue in my opinion is the timing of the breach and all the sudden reports of gunfire at other locations. It seemed way to timed to create confusion with the police. </p>

<p>As for other reports of shooting ... it could have been deliberate decoy (which the cops oddly stated many times - which is a factor of their training). Each time the reports were followed up and written off they became more concerned with deception.  </p>

<p>The people making reports were probably seeing walking wounded running around and making assumptions about where shooters were based on the hysteria. It’s easy to get confused in a mess as big as that one. </p>

Surely someone would have taken pics of the lobby the next day or whatever. People are screaming for video of Paddock in Mandaly, rightly so, but we&#39;re gonna take this lady&#39;s word for it with no evidence whatsoever? </p>

<p>Just look at the way she talked to the lady guarding the casino floor, she intentionally was super duper vague and did not mention Belagio was shot. Gimmie more evidence, I don&#39;t believe this lady.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hope that people keep digging, the updates and theories are improving. Even the retarded ones are useful somewhat. Keep in mind though that the paranoia of &quot;this sub has 10,000 new people on it!!!&quot; Has A LOT to do with this event being fresh and a lot of people having questions about what the media is saying. I&#39;m one of those new lurkers as I&#39;ve never really been active here before. Don&#39;t think of every new person on here as a sleeper agent for the globalists have a little bit more of an open mind that a lot of us are regular people from the front page of Reddit that are looking to you guys to shed some light on some stuff. Some of the posts have made me really think and some have made me roll my eyes. Either way, never settle for answers unless you&#39;ve done your research. </p>

To satisfy &quot;most&quot; conspiracy theorists, like this subreddit, and give them bones to chew on for a few weeks. TPTB have had decades of experience and planning to know how to implement these things without mistakes.

<p>Oh, and have a look at <a href="https://imgur.com/jKoKtds">this photo</a> I saw here yesterday. The devil horns hand symbol is prominent on the left, by the concert where the people were.

The armies of internet slueths were on duty and it didn&#39;t take long at all to start finding the threads to pull and the holes too poke.</p>

<p>To me that is a very good sign people are waking up. Before when I post things the shills would be all over it and how crazy I am. This event, I&#39;m actually hearing crickets with the things I can sharing. Pretty hard to deny things when the pictures are right in your face.</p>

<p>I wish all those people could coordinate what happened to them and make a LOT of noise with their proof and demand the news do something about it.</p>

<p>I also wonder if anyone has considered talking to someone at the hospitals that would know how many deaths came in that night and start adding up those actual numbers. Clearly they didn&#39;t all happen at the concert, but it would be easy to mix them into that count.</p>

Now Charlottesville and this they are coming to me talking about how fake it is. Its strange how quickly it turned, I&#39;ve been awake for at least a decade and never seen so many sheep off the internet starting to get it themselves. I wonder why the deep state is making these things so obvious, I think they could a much better job had they wanted to, its almost like they want everyone to know its them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi there are many types of false flags. Some like 911 involve real deaths and only a small amount of hoaxery. These we can pinpoint the who, the how etc.</p>

<p>Then there are false flags like Sandy Hook, which are almost entirely ficticious, which are designed to have a large number of red herrings designed to maximise time CT waste and infighting.</p>

<p>This Los Angles false flag seems to fit into that category.</p>

<p>According to VT, Google AI designs the scripts for the false flags and the roll out of the narrative.</p>

<p>Failure of these false flags to be believed may be due to AI not understanding humans properly.</p>

<p>Or maybe AI wants the population to know the Government is doing false flags to maximise chance of civil revolt and later martial law.</p>

<p>Is faking a mass shooting Legal? Does it just count as propaganda and not terrorism or fraud?</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts though.</p>

<p>Maybe no one uploaded videos because there was nothing that interesting in those locations? Just an idea. Maybe all the action was localized to Mandalay. I&#39;m not saying for sure there was one gut behind all this, but I&#39;m also not certain there was more than one.</p>

<p>And maybe they locked down other hotels because they weren&#39;t certain where the shooter was?</p>
