    <div class="md"><p>Mostly forgotten about, as I believe it was dismissed as the type of people you usually see at a concert doing that there was also a guy in a yellow shirt with a megaphone saying the same stuff (repent or die) as people were going in.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they would because they&#39;re INSIDE the venue, which has a fence around it if you didnt know. Highly doubt Las Vegas security would let a random hobo in the venue without a ticket. furthemore i doubt a 21 year old girl would mistake thus said hobo for a hispanic/persian looking female</p>

<p>I did know. They do that to keep non-paying customers out. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>They wouldn&#39;t. That&#39;s my point.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Unless the hobo was a hispanic/persian looking female. 
We don&#39;t know anything about this young lady, there was zero follow up. My point was why would someone plan this whole thing, then buy a ticket to get inside to warn people? If she didn&#39;t buy the ticket and just wanted to warn someone, who let her in? If she got in without a ticket, how tight was security? What or who else got in. </p>

<p>your logic is way off </p>

<p>My logic is fine, I&#39;m not saying anything for fact. What I&#39;m doing is trying to explore more options or remove lines of reasoning that don&#39;t work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a lot bigger than just someone drunk saying you&#39;re gone die. There have been people who said people were letting off fireworks right before the shooting, so that establishes, ppl in the bigger plot were in the crowd. Now the biggest thing is and I don&#39;t know if anyone can confirm But someone who also heard the lady say that in the crowd said &quot;you&#39;re all Gona die&quot; &quot;they&#39;re all around you&quot; now that&#39;s huge if true the all around you part, can anyone else confirm that, heard it soomewhere here online </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t remember the source I read a few days ago, but the last updated I saw was that initial reports were a little misinterpreted, that there was a woman making statements like that, but it wasn&#39;t directed at the entire crowd, it was more focused on a group she was fighting with.  But this was from the mainstream media, so I have no reason to believe that more than anything else I&#39;ve seen, so I have no coincidence in the accuracy of that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It had all the earmarks if a faked MSM news report to create a narrative around Paddock&#39;s girlfriend that most likely had to be quickly dropped due to all confusion surrounding her whereabouts. </p>

<p>The media had to be complicit in this, it was no accident and they didn&#39;t just stumble upon this girl who was as cool as cucumber and articulated her account without a hitch as if it had been well rehearsed in advance. That interview was staged.</p>

<p>The girl&#39;s general description and the general impression it left at the time was that Paddock&#39;s girlfriend must have been the one who attempted to warn the concert goers... like she&#39;d found out at the last minute and desperately tried to warn others of the impending danger. A cover story with some evidence to back it up for her to plausibly deny any other knowledge or involvement in the crime.</p>

<p>The information that the girlfriend&#39;s credit card had been used to rent Paddock&#39;s room and that the police were looking for her was already circulating at that point. </p>

<p>The real question is how does the so-called girlfiend figures in all this? Why was her credit card used if Paddock is as wealthy and well known gambler as they claimed? And wouldn&#39;t she have had to confirm that she was authorizing the use of her card for that hotel stay? </p>

<p>All the mis-information and dis-information concerning her whereabouts and involvement right from the very beginning was basically the big tip-off that there was something far more out of the ordinary than we were being told about this. </p>

<p>It went from reports that the police had found her and were questioning her to claiming the very next day they no longer considered her to be a person of interest to suddenly reporting she was in Tokyo, and then the Philippines where Paddock had supposedly wired her $100,000 with no explanation as to how those previous reports came about.</p>
