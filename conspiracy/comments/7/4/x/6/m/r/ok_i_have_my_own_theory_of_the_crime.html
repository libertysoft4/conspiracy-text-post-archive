        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Paddock has met a new, younger woman who he&#39;s been having an affair with. What he doesn&#39;t know is she&#39;s a honey pot federal operative.  As their relationship grows, she asks him to take her to Vegas on his next big gambling trip. He agrees. In a coincidence that is anything but, Paddock gets an email from Mandalay Bay offering him the big high rollers suite for an entire week, (9/25-10/1).<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/us/stephen-paddock-gambling.html">1</a> He seizes the opportunity and sends his girlfriend to the Philippines. <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a12785639/marilou-danley-stephen-paddock-girlfriend-statement/">2</a></p>

<p>Reservations are also made in his name at hotels overlooking concerts around the country and in LV the week earlier.<a href="http://time.com/4970955/stephen-paddock-motive-music-festivals-lollapalooza/">3</a></p>

<p>They check in and things go so well Paddock wires his girlfriend $100,000 to buy a house in the Philippines, a gesture she interprets as his way of breaking up with her. <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a12785639/marilou-danley-stephen-paddock-girlfriend-statement/">2</a> Paddock is seen around the casino with the honey pot agent. <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/10/06/mystery-woman-seen-las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock">4</a></p>

<p>That same employee who set up the suite and is in on the plot, books the adjoining room under Paddock&#39;s name on the 28th, unbeknownst to Paddock.  <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/728254/las-vegas-shooter-been-holed-hotel-room-4-days">5</a> <a href="http://archive.is/soi5M">6</a>  </p>

<p>In that adjoining room, suitcases of guns stolen from Paddock&#39;s home are wheeled in over several days.<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/stephen-paddock-las-vegas-shooting-mandalay-bay-676259">7</a> Paddock has no idea and does not have a key to that room, nor does he have access through the inside door.  Also rolled in are belt-fed longer range weapons that are better able to hit concert goers from such a long distance and fire more rounds than anything stolen from Paddock&#39;s home ever could.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mXe9dk77bk">8</a> Several of Paddock&#39;s rifles are modified with bump stocks to help explain the discrepancy.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/us/bump-stock-las-vegas-gun.html">9</a></p>

<p>Sunday afternoon, the honey pot asks to borrow Paddock&#39;s SUV to go run an errand. He gives her the keys and his gfs valet card.  She takes the SUV to a warehouse to have it filled with various types of legal but lethal explosives.<a href="http://ktla.com/2017/10/05/1600-rounds-of-ammo-50-pounds-of-explosives-material-found-in-las-vegas-shooters-car-police/">10</a> She returns the SUV to the garage<a href="http://gotnews.com/breaking-lauraloomer-pokes-another-hole-fbis-las-vegas-narrative/">10b</a>, but Paddock will never see her again. She, however, has forgotten her cell phone charger in the suite. <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/mystery-investigators-discover-charger-incompatible-vegas-gunmans-cellphones-hotel-suite/">11</a></p>

<p>Sunday evening, the real shooter(s) is/are in position in the adjoining room ready to start the operation. He or another team have earlier entered Paddock&#39;s suite while he is at the video poker machines and began moving in Paddock&#39;s guns from the adjoining room and start generally setting up the crime scene. </p>

<p>Everything is in place except one thing: Paddock isn&#39;t in his suite, he&#39;s still paying video poker.  He&#39;s had a good week, even if he&#39;s starting to wonder where the new love of his life has disappeared to. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a problem. Paddock was to be lured away from the room and lured back at the right time by a few different scenarios.  They can&#39;t use the honey pot anymore because Paddock has to be alone in the suite, and he can&#39;t be seen to be with anyone this close to zero hour.  </p>

<p>They have Jesus Campos their security guard whose in on it (This is just a theory, if you&#39;re reading this Jesus) to approach Paddock at the video poker machine and ask him if he&#39;s in 32135. He says he is and Jesus tells him he just got a door alarm from his suite and after investigating he thinks there might have been a break in in his room. He asks Paddock to follow him up there and determine if anything&#39;s missing.</p>

<p>They take the elevator up to 32nd floor. As they enter the suite Paddock is subdued and murdered and placed in position to make it look like suicide.  Gloves are put on his hands to avoid any lack of fingerprints on the weapons.   </p>

<p>The shooting begins from the adjoining room with the carefully setup heavy artillery.  Campos is in the adjoining room with the operators, monitoring the hallway via gopros on the room service cart. Anytime a guest pokes their head out, he tells them to get back inside, giving the impression the situation is being responded to. His ultimate job is to kill any would-be citizen hero who might take it upon themselves to try to stop the shooting. They know the SWAT team will take at least 10-15 minutes to respond. </p>

<p>Once SWAT is close to coming up on the elevator, which was shut off for safety and must be specially started again for SWAT, and the team in the stairwell is close to breaking through the obstruction placed on the 32nd floor stairwell door, Campos fakes a leg wound and the operaters spray the hallway through the suite doors. They then break a window in the suite, before they disappear into other rooms as guests.</p>

<p>SWAT shows up and Campos directs them to 32135.  He tells them he was responding to the suite door alarm going off when he was sprayed with bullets. He claims to have been unaware of the massive shooting taking place from the widow.<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/05/us/security-guard-las-vegas-hotel/index.html">12</a> SWAT enters into a barricade mode.<a href="http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-las-vegas-response/">13</a> This had been expected by the operators.  Campos insists on sticking around to help evacuate the floor.<a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/862770/Las-Vegas-shooting-Mandalay-Bay-Stephen-Paddock-security-guard-hero">14</a> Conveniently, he starts with the room the operators are in, now disguised as guests. After a while the SWAT incredulously asks him if he shouldn&#39;t be seeking medical attention, to which he agrees and and leaves.<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mandalay-bay-security-guard-jesus-campos-distracting-las-vegas-shooter-2017-10">15</a></p>

<p>Eventually SWAT blow open the door but Paddock is dead. Before SWAT can relax, the adjoining room must be checked out, but the operators locked it from both sides before disappearing. SWAT blow out the connecting door<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4951800/Cops-arrived-Vegas-shooter-s-room-12-minutes.html">16</a> but inside they find only what appears to be a more thought out snipers nest than in the suite complete with better broken window, but no weapons, and no other people.  </p>

<p>Many of the crime scene photos from the suite are leaked to the press just to put a graphic bow on the Lone Shooter narrative in the public&#39;s mind.<a href="http://heavy.com/news/2017/10/stephen-paddock-crime-scene-photos-hotel-room-inside-guns-leaked-fake-real/">17</a>  However, the public just isn&#39;t buying it.<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/las-vegas-shooting-conspiracy-theories-stephen-paddock-note-pictures-images-a7983766.html">18</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea totally in the realm of possibility, minus any motive in this story, no reason they pick Paddock, no reason they shoot up a concert, just bc you choose to believe any crockpot theory out there doesnt mean people cant question it so acting like a dickhead doesnt make people see from your point of view</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does a theory have to include every minute detail to satisfy you? Read his post title - &#39;OP has a theory of the crime&#39; - The goddamn FBI hasn&#39;t released a motive, or very many details whatsoever, and you&#39;re going to defend some prick who told him to post his idea to a fan fiction sub, snarkily dubbing this garbage? fuck you too. I find OP&#39;s theory to be in the realm of possibility according to the research I have done. I didn&#39;t claim &quot;DING DING DING we figured it the fuck on out boys!&quot; I&#39;m not asking for anyone to see my POV beyond trash talking OP&#39;s theory, which had 0 instances of proven impossibilities, is not something OP, nor this subs readers, should be subjected to. If you have evidence to refute the original theory, please provide it, so we can move on to the next step in discovery. That is <em>exactly</em> how this works, once again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. With most of the theories I’ve heard, they seem plausible. The only thing that’s usually left out is that he went to LIB and Lolla. Why would he do that? Or did I miss that this ended up being something the media made up? Either way, great theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need algebra because he didn’t have that many test shots. he wanted mass casualty so he had to calculate and get it right the first time. Otherwise people would start dispersing once he started shooting.</p>

<p>Numbers were probably his location height, distance to event, and bullet speed. He wanted to figure out which degree to aim his gun. The scene would have some kind of degree measuring device. </p>

<p>How about this spin on it...
Campos phones Paddock and impersonates hotel security. Uses some excuse like they have reason to suspect a break in to his room. Claims that he got Paddock&#39;s number from the hotel files, as the guest registered to the affected room.</p>

<p>This allows honeypot to disappear cleanly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the story goes that Campos was just walking his &quot;usual rounds&quot;... I&#39;m paraphrasing here.
i
Is that something hotel security would do? Because they have elite security teams, right? Hence there would be no need in a modern organization to have mindlessly wandering security personnel. They can quickly target any problem areas. This was a high roller floor he was on, so there would be no expectation of rowdy customers creating trouble.</p>

<p>My theory is not that Paddock was setup per se, but that they allowed him to do it. It&#39;s within the realm of their capability to manipulate people into violence, and it&#39;s <em>much</em> cleaner. But since hotel security is undoubtedly in constant contact with LEA, they could have had him watching over Paddock&#39;s room, because... I don&#39;t know why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehh, I guess Campos was gonna be there when SWAT arrived anyway, and it made then ask him less questions. The spraying the hallway is an easier way for him to &quot;take a bullet&quot; rather than a direct confrontation. They break the window in the suite because he is dead in the suite. They kill him in the suite so harder to drag him to the adjoining room. The operators had a person who books rooms at Mandalay in on it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don’t have to explain it. I simply disagree with that theory. If there are other military trained personnel in this thread that can confirm that no one is writing down on paper to drop shots. If you watch the video taken from the concert level, Aldean is singing and it’s not until after a few seconds into the verse he jumps off stage. The concert had people packed in like sardines so dropping a few rounds into a huge square is pretty easy to gauge without a sheet of paper. Keep in mind he had other guns to shoot with, unless they were all sighted in the same the note would be useless because each weapons scope would have to be sighted in for windage. So sure the not could have had height and distance written down, but he’s not using simple math to calculate bullet drop. Law enforcement releasing comments that he had calculations or variables written down is nonsense.</p>

<p>What stood out to me is that the officers stated Campos got separated from the rest of the team checking floors.  Why would a lone security guard separate himself from a police SWAT team to take on a shooter with automatic weapons?  Interesting also that they stated it&#39;s a miracle after 200 rounds he only got shot in the calf and stuck around to try to help  or&quot;interfere&quot; with the police response and guest evacuation.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly when the police located the suspects room and Campos, the shooting had stopped.  A lot of interesting questions here.</p>

<p>Imagine being that hooker. She slept with a true monster, as his plan to commit an atrocity was underway. That’s probably fucking with her head something fierce. </p>
