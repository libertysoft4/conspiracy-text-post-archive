<p>Is this because i am more integrated in skeptical communities, so to speak, or is this really what&#39;s happening? </p>

<p>TL;DR: Are people &#39;waking up&#39;, or have i sorrounded myself with likeminded people?</p>

<p>It is happening.  Only problem is the POWER has been bitten so many times trying to lie to us about other events, they developed a new strategy.</p>

<p>Time and time again since Waco, or 9/11, the narrative gets bit on multiple fronts.</p>

<p>Now we have an FBI that only yesterday, their only comments were about a billboard being erected &quot;If you see something, say something&quot;</p>

<p>We are 6 days in.</p>

<p>The FBI simple could release the check in.  Tape footage throughout the stay.  Say something about the other reports from other casinos.</p>

<p>Number of brass recovered.  </p>

<p>A list of the weapons and where/when bought.</p>

<p>The valet documentation.  Food Service.  A history of wins/losses.</p>

<p>NO ONE IS REVEALING EVEN THE MOST BASIC INFO.</p>

<p>It stinks.  Plain and simple.</p>

It’s almost like he’s unable to even hear the words I’m saying, the just aren’t landing, something in him rejects the whole concept.  I’m really sorry to hear that about your husband. It’s uncomfortable in a relationship, but I’m kind of jealous of them too. It seems peaceful. He doesn’t seem anxious like I am, he isn’t losing sleep.</p>

He comes in about 5:30 am he is leaving for work and I say,&quot; have a great day, I&#39;m just watching your government craft a narrative and blame a lone nut again.&quot;  He says, &quot;I&#39;m sure you will tell me about it later.&quot;  </p>

<p>I think at this point he just accepts that I don&#39;t believe anything he does and vice versa.  It&#39;s fine as long as we don&#39;t really talk about it. There is so much other stuff going on that we can avoid it most of the time. </p>

<p>For me it&#39;s like this,  he has been watching football all day, I&#39;m not going to watch that but he isn&#39;t going to watch Grey&#39;s Anatomy or Scandal either. We just have our own things. </p>

<p>Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of human civilization define Infinity as Unity, ultimately everything is part of All there is/Infinity and thus everything can&#39;t help but be the Creator/Universe experiencing itself.</p>

<p>Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of &quot;God&quot;/existence as well in session 13

<p>Here are some favorite Law of One quotes from Q&#39;uo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The heart of your journey is to seek the Creator that is within you, the Creator that you are, the Creator that is all things. There can be no other way of looking upon an infinite creation of unity. The Creator took pleasure in making this, what you call creation, in order that it might know itself through the free will of each of its entities that it has created. From the Logos of every star within your skies, to the planet upon which you dwell, to each of your entities that you share the illusion with, each of you has free will to exercise however you wish. Each exercise of free will teaches the Creator more of itself, and fulfills the purpose of the illusion. Each of your actions reveals more to you of yourself, and if you are conscious of the seeking process, of the Creator itself, it is a journey of lovers, the creator loving you with unending love, you seeking and loving the Creator with a growing love. At some point, you will find the Creator, there is no other outcome for the end of this journey. At some point, the creator will know all that you know and will thank you for all that you have taught it of itself. At some point every entity within this great one infinite creation will coalesce again into unity, bringing home to the Creator the fruits of this journey through the octave of densities in which you now travel. Q&#39;uo transcripts September 4, 2016</p>

<p>as well as </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let us look first at the first choice and that was the choice of the Creator to know Itself. In choosing to know Itself the Creator flung from Itself innumerable and infinite sparks of love which coalesced into each awareness that dwells within the infinite awareness. Each of those sparks of awareness is the Creator, and yet, because the Creator chose free will in the manifesting of sparks of self, each spark is unique and has been unique since before time began. Each of you is eternal and in many ways immutable, a citizen of infinite nature, worth and value. Each one a holograph of the Creator and yet each one different.
Thus, the choice that birthed each of you was a choice to know the truth, to know the self, and as the Creator is love, so is each entity love. This is the central truth. This is that which does not change. Yet this is that which is ever wrapped in mystery. Each within this circle has come through many planes of existence, has learned a great deal, and each within this circle chose not only this incarnation now being experienced but also that cast of characters with whom each entity interacts in the family, in the close associations of friends, and all those who have significant connections with the self. There were agreements made before incarnation, most notably with the parents and those within the bonds of kinship of blood and of commonality of interest. Each difficulty, each crux that leaves one in a position of being forced to discover the self has been placed not with a hand that desires to punish but with a hand of loving self that wishes to serve ever more deeply, ever more purely. -Q&#39;uo @the_law_of_one (May 18, 1997)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy is a difficult realm, this sub has both incredible well thought out info and proof, and a boatload of cancer, not from shills, just from stupid people that will force a conspiracy on anything so you have to use your brain and not let idiots take you down the same bullshit rabbit hole those who actually do cover up events try to. </p>

<p>Also, when it comes to your SO and the majority of other people in this country and this world, you have to understand that most people are pretty &quot;plugged in&quot; for lack of a less juvenile description. </p>

<p>The thought that their government, their countrymen, their neighbors, their heroes, their scientists, etc etc would be involved in things that kill them, poison them, brainwash them, etc is enough to give them a mental breakdown, so they block any truth. </p>

<p>There are plenty of conspiracy theorists who go off the deep end because of this, hoarding survival supplies, living each day in terror, it can really break a person if you go deep. </p>

<p>When you understand just how much horrific death, and torture and abuse is done in this world by multiple groups and individuals, it can really fuck with your wellbeing for awhile and some people aren&#39;t mentally strong enough to swallow that pill and come back to center.</p>

<p>I focus on undeniable conspiracy, stuff with actual documents, stuff with actual arrests, etc, and I used to attempt to get people to wake up with that, because it was hardcore black and white evidence, such as operation northwoods. </p>

<p>It is amazing and horrifying to see people&#39;s reactions when you introduce them to their first bitter pill that their so called protectors were plotting to kill them, most of them immediately grasp for excuses &quot;it was a long time ago&quot; &quot;it was a different world&quot; </p>

<p>Conspiracy research is a lonely road, but an exciting one, to see the world for what it really is, to know you aren&#39;t crazy for feeling so disconnected from the false reality everyone else seems to be living in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>unfortunately this response is somewhat political, though not with any intent- if you were around during the early gwb years, did you notice a similar questioning of the official story? it seems in this time, people have much more information, but still seem keen to jump on current officials, while showing little critical analysis of the previous eight years. in terms of non-official contemporary critical analysis, not much difference noticed. for example, people in my circles are quite likely to question some science article about nutrition or an investigation into net neutrality, but no more or less open to believing ancient humans were intelligent or that the frb was passed at midnight on christmas. definitely more exposure to all kinds of information, but not any more original thought or analysis.   </p>

<p>It was full blown treason and so is the entire 9/11 criminal cover up. Not only was it treason, it was also a conspiracy to commit mass murder and to eliminate our constitutional rights. Ask yourself why our president colluded with the Israeli government to eliminate our constitutional rights and you have the motive for 9/11. </p>

I&#39;ll give you an example - I was chatting with my coworker the other day, and as soon as Vegas came up, she (not knowing I&#39;m hugely into conspiracies), said that something fishy is going on and the official story is bullshit. Then she went into the media, and how they lie, the government lies, and the people who are actually in charge are all behind the curtain. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t sound to remarkable, right? Well, some background on this coworker - she&#39;s in her late 20&#39;s, black, speaks Ebonics and lives in a shelter with her husband and son. She&#39;s a wonderful woman and works really hard, but just isn&#39;t the kind of person you&#39;d expect to understand all of this.

    <div class="md"><p>well yeah, it does appear that people are suddenly &quot;becoming more aware&quot; but I wonder, are they <em>actually</em>? or are they simply lapping up this whole &quot;trump et al vs msm&quot; eagerly? I feel like these may not even be their own thoughts, but instead are mostly the result of propaganda. what&#39;s the end game? well, maybe making people distrust and question literally <em>everything</em>, as a sort of extra layer of &quot;cover&quot;.... like, it say, an &quot;independent journalist/reporter&quot; of sorts(aka youtuber and/or blogger; I say this because obviously MSM is looooooooong gone) does somehow come across some information, or maybe even some random person gets cellphone footage of something they shouldn&#39;t have, something potentially damaging to TPTB or their people or whatever, your average person is already in the mindset of &quot;lolyaright&quot;. when everyone is unsure of what exactly is real and what is not, and we all get into the habit of questioning everything(not saying this is a negative thing, we <em>have</em> to do this!) then, well, I can just see how that would be helpful to &quot;them&quot;. </p>

<p>this also, obviously, adds to the whole &quot;divide and conquer&quot; narrative as well as working as a sort of method of getting all those pesky independent thinkers on &quot;their&quot; level: they have a general idea of what even us &quot;trouble-makers&quot; are thinking/feeling, etc which let&#39;s them better manipulate, etc. an example using the whole trump administration thing... there are people who <em>STILL</em> tell themselves that he&#39;s &quot;on (their) side&quot; and &quot;not involved w/ TPTB/regular politicians&quot;; without him, these people would likely be your average shit disturbers but instead of disturbing shit now they&#39;re too busy suckin dick and shitposting. perfect, right?!</p>

Probably not, it&#39;s not as if the powers that be who control the majority of the media most people consume would want you to know that. The corporate media has just been more and more blatantly deceiving the public as time goes on, especially after past year&#39;s election. When the gaslighting is that heavy, it&#39;s less like people are merely waking up and more like they&#39;re being forcibly awoken by the incessant braying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are becoming more skeptical overall.  I&#39;ve noticed a distinct change in my social circle where people are questioning things.  They aren&#39;t assuming everything is a conspiracy or false flag, but many of them are starting to become aware that we&#39;re being manipulated with propaganda and misinformation.</p>

<p>The sad part is the fact that some people probably believe this.  Anything other than global federalism is obviously racist and needs to be wiped out, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The oil industry [Koch, Bush, etc.] is against state&#39;s rights because they don&#39;t want states passing environmental laws. </p>

<p>The whole puzzle finally made sense to me when I heard Jimmy Dore say that the Koch&#39;s funded and staffed the DLC way back in the Clinton years. Bill Clinton was helping Poppy Bush import illegal drugs during the Bush I presidency; our government has been getting progressively more and more corrupt ever since. That is why both sides of the isle seem so similar, they really are.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No haven&#39;t you heard? State&#39;s Rights is what all the Nazis say to eachother. Rachel Maddow just did a piece on this. It&#39;s called &quot;dog whistling&quot; because only they can hear it. They just want their own state to themselves. </p>

<p><strong>Remember the Confederates were fighting for &quot;state&#39;s rights&quot; in the civil war!</strong></p>

<p>Also watch out for people signalling to eachother by talking about &quot;safety&quot; and &quot;crime rates.&quot; It&#39;s total racism against immigrants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bit of both. Look up the Wall Street bombing in the early 20&#39;s where 50 people died... idk.. I think we are more aware because of the media and internet, if you lived in the south during that bombing you might hear about it on the radio or read it in the news but that&#39;s about it, after a day it&#39;s over and you trusted the FBI will do their job to solve it. Now.... I don&#39;t trust them at all. I&#39;ve been saying this for awhile and I think this is part of the case. Look at the Chris Cornell incident in Cincinnati. The FBI set up to sell weapons to him and arrested him before he could travel to the capitol and shoot up congress. I think the FBI wanted Stephen to set up a weapons deal with the cartels in order to get hire up members. The cartels knew and killed him (two revolver shots) and then fired upon the crowd to send a message. Why would there be two holes in the hotel room windows? Why would there be a note with numbers on it? It&#39;s definitely not trajectory numbers considering the massive crowd below wouldn&#39;t need long distant calculations. The audio along with the shots / speeds of them don&#39;t add up. Yeah. I think the cartels sending a message to the FBI and the stuff &quot;found&quot; in his car was FBI planting it there after </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thank you SO much for this reply. I thought I was the only one. It’s scary how deep it seems like it goes. It’s almost like he’s unable to even hear the words I’m saying, the just aren’t landing, something in him rejects the whole concept.  I’m really sorry to hear that about your husband. It’s uncomfortable in a relationship, but I’m kind of jealous of them too. It seems peaceful. He doesn’t seem anxious like I am, he isn’t losing sleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The drug war is rich with Republican presidents doing very bad things. The Bush family is basically in charge of importing illegal drugs; the CIA does it on a massive scale. We have wars in order for them to make sure they have a supply. </p>

<p>Plus the US public is their main market. I just read that more people are dying from opiates in the US these days than from guns, and businesses can&#39;t find a sober workforce. You can chalk that up to Republican leadership, the Democrats only helped with it. </p>
