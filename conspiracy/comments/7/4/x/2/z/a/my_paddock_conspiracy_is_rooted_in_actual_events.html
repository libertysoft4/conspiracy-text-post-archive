        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not a big conspiracy person but this is too fishy for me. I believe Paddock was possibly used by an agency for a Fast n Furious type situation in which we sell guns to ISIS and they are traced inward. Agency pays Paddock some dough and he launders it through the casino. ISIS affiliates tell Paddock to book a hotel at lolla then they realize there is secret service everywhere so no go, or to possibly test him out. </p>

<p>Eventually end up at Route 91 and things are good to go, they show up but already know what&#39;s going down with the weapon trace scheme, kill Paddock then open fire on the festival, security shows up and they shoot him then make their way back to their hotel room and act like scared patrons of the hotel, or hop up one flight to the Saudi owner four seasons, who we know helped orchestrate 9/11. The government agency knows they totally fucked up and can&#39;t let it get out so they still pin it on Paddock. It does not make sense that Paddock did this which is why I am so interested, it does make sense that ISIS did this because they have done it a shitload of times.</p>

<p>Paddock was not clean, it is a statistical impossibility to make 5 mil profit in a year from video poker - you would go broke. He used video poker to launder his money.</p>

<p>Does this make sense to anyone else?</p>

<p>EDIT: I hear the words Deep State in every comment - I DO NOT think that this is about some secret overarching gov&#39;t agency trying to influence American policy - I think they were trying to work against ISIS and got fucked over, kind of like a bay of pigs situation, hence the cover-up - they don&#39;t want people to know how badly they fucked up and that they are responsible for the largest mass shooting in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All that video proves is for that bust he maintained ~600 rounds per min. In the damn waveform you can see that one maintains a solid rate of fire and the other varies slightly.</p>

<p>Notice the deception tacit of not showing the individual waveforms with the sound they go with and how the M240 video is played much louder then the other when combined to hide the inconsistencies.</p>

<p>The video is a con trying to get views and I have given it more then I want to admit proving it a fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to copy and paste my response to another similair post, but the arms deal doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense for a lot of reasons (the hammer to break the windows from another comment in this thread, for example), but for one I can answer from research experience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Him meeting with some ISIS buy team is such a ridiculous claim though. I study the SCW and MENA as a hobby and they certainly don&#39;t need to buy American weapons from arms dealers.</p>

<p>Regardless of what position you take on the subject of the war, the American supported players in ME get their weapons and training hand delivered and simply looking over a SCW/MENA small arms Twitter account shows how thriving the weapons market is over there. They have all the weapons they need, they don&#39;t need to clandestinely buy them from some white dude in a hotel (probably the worst place to a covert Arms deal)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, would love to read some of your stuff sometime. I think that&#39;s a great point to make as well, and was brought up when I wrote the original comment. </p>

<p>The thing is I have no idea why ISIS, or any terror organization for that matter, would not jump on the publicity of killing an &#39;agent of the infidels&#39; and the subsequent massacre. Seems like some great PR, especially since they&#39;re so desperate to push for any PR, especially the timeless counter-espionage propaganda they&#39;re so well versed in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP I follow along with part of your theory but not all. See above. </p>

<p>I agree that there are enough known &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; type incidents to build from, even if many people STILL refuse to accept them despite incredible evidence. </p>

<p>That said, and given the timing of other incidents, the Awan Contra Spy Ring needs to be reviewed for possible ties. I believe there was a Dumbo Drop incident at MB in 2014 so it&#39;s possible, especially given the length of tentacles on this damn Awan situation. </p>

<p>These patterns repeat themselves so your reasoning is sound. It&#39;s the details that need hashing out. </p>

<p>The gov and deep State are putting out ted herrings and disinformation all over the place. That alone tells me there&#39;s massive fuckery at play. </p>
