    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion it’s a red herring to deflect the real conversation. Check out Adam Weishaupt the man credited for helping the Illuminati around 1776 born a Jew but then converted to Catholicism he was a Jesuit priest. But the deal is what difference does it make if the Jews are on top and the Jesuits report to them or vice versa? They are both the NWO and are trying to kill us to further their ends. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plans, moreover, were set on foot to have the university of the third centenary the Society of Jesus was suppressed, but some of the <strong>ex-Jesuits retained their professorships</strong> for a while longer. A movement was inaugurated in 1772 by Adam Weishaupt, professor of canon law, with a view to securing the triumph of the rationalistic &quot;enlightment&quot; in Church and State by means of the secret society of &quot;Illuminati&quot;, which he founded. But this organization was suppressed in 1786 by the Elector Carl theodore, and Weishaupt was dismissed. On 25 November, 1799, the elector Maximilian IV, later King Maximilian I, decreed that the university, which was involved in financial difficulties, should be transferred to Landshut; and this was done in the following May. <strong>Among its leading professors towards the close were Winter the church historian</strong>, Schrank the naturalist, and <strong>Johann Michael Sailer, writer on moral philosophy and pedagogy, who later became Bishop of Ratisbon</strong>.</p>

<p>And to be a professor of Cannon Law requires you to be on the faculty of a Vatican-approved University:</p>

<p>Weishaut, having been raised by Jesuits, taught by them, and selected to be a professor at their school to teach the inner workings and legal system of the Catholic Church, and the fact that a leading member of the Bavarian Illuminati accused him of being a Jesiut, suffices to show the Jesuit influence on Westphalia. Not to mention most of the agitators of the enlightenment age were trained by Jesuits: Robespierre, Abbe Sieyes, Volitare, Diderot, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your engaging association fallacies. Did Catholics have a monopoly on universities? No, they did not. Secondly, Weishaupt&#39;s illuminism was a bastardization of the Catholic sacrament of confession.

<p>There is no fallacy invoked by factual details showing the influence of the Jesuits on Weishaupt and how he was naturally enamored with he Catholic Church by virtue of teaching Canon Law. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wow, do you realize these are exactly the method that the Jesuits use? The confessional has got them expelled from countries. Read about their expulsion from Venice for abuse of the confessional. If what you say is true, this is further proof that Weishaupt was under the auspices of the Jesuits. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, being trained by Jesuits doesn&#39;t mean anything. It&#39;s just some Catholic hating fanatics reaching for something with which to malign the Church.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Total ignorance. The assassins of Henry III and Henry IV were trained by Jesuits and admitted this was why they carried out these regicides. Ferdinand II was trained by Jesuits to wage the Thirty Years War against Protestants in Europe:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It was evident that the end was at hand—that the insane and bloody project,
conceived in the bosom of Jesuitism, and transplanted to the brain of [Emperor]
Ferdinand II, to crush into the earth the cause for which Huss had died and
Luther had lived, was now doomed to a complete and everlasting
disappointment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just told you, for example, in Venice. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The life of the Jesuits,&quot; their historian says, &quot;is a warfare;&quot; and we cannot be surprised at what they have suffered in it. The senate of Venice was excommunicated by Pope Paul IV. on the 17th of April, 1606; but the government of the commonwealth exercised its rights in prohibiting the publication of the Roman decrees under the severest penalties. The majority of the clergy obeyed this edict; but the Jesuits set it at defiance in conformity with their habit of counting civil law a dead letter whenever it is repugnant to the Pope&#39;s authority. On the 10th of May, they appeared before the senate, which decreed their immediate expulsion; and they were actually taken out of Venice two hours after the ensuing midnight. The people crowded to witness their embarkation; and when the superior of the company solicited a blessing from the vicar-patriarch, who had taken possession of his church in the name of the republic, the bystanders shouted, &quot;Go with a mischance.&quot; The manner of the expulsion is described as follows: —&quot; At the hour of the Angelus the gondolas arrived, and we put within them the few articles we were allowed to remove, the officers who had been sent to watch not withdrawing their eyes a moment from us. Afterwards arrived the vicar with the administrators; we recited our litanies and travellers&#39; prayers to obtain a successful journey; and we turned our steps to the gondolas. All the quarter was filled with our friends, who were deploring our departure; but none of thein was allowed to come near us. Dispersed in four barques, and seated amongst the soldiers who guarded us, we were carried out of Venice.&quot;</p>

<p>The Jesuits did no more than their duty, as such, in infringing the civil law to obey the Pope; but it is impossible not to recognise the right of the Venetian government to make its laws respected by all persons residing within its territory; they must otherwise have renounced the national independence, and, of course, disgraced their country. But meanwhile, though the Jesuits went out of Venice, the seed remained behind them which they had sown; and the senate had to proceed judicially against their proselytes. The Council of Ten declared that many men had complained to them of not being treated with the respect and tenderness they were entitled to by their wives and children, whom the Jesuits had set against them by alleging that they were excommunicated by the Pope. Moreover, letters from a Jesuit to his Holiness were intercepted, representing that the latter had, in the city of Venice, more than 300 young men of the highest nobility who were ready to do his bidding. <strong>The senate ascertained likewise that the Jesuits made use of the confessional to learn family secrets, the means and dispositions of private men, and the resources and strength of the state</strong>; and that, every six months, they sent a memoir on these subjects to their general through the medium of his provincials. After their expulsion from Padua and Bergamo, numerous letters were found in their dwellings, which they had not had time to burn, and which justified the charges that had been brought against them. The government, therefore, on the 11th of July, 1606, decreed the perpetual expulsion of the Company of Jesus from the territories of the republic; and that they were never to be readmitted without an unanimous vote of the senate. Nor was such a measure even to be proposed, except through a commission of six senators, of whom five at least must adhere to it, nor without a previous reading of the complaints and charges on which their expulsion had been founded. On the 18th of August, the Council of Ten enacted, that no one should receive letters from the Jesuits, under pain of fine, banishment, or imprisonment in a fortress.</p>

<p>Teaching Canon law is teaching <em>to a tee</em> the Catholic system of law and conduct. And the Jesuits were waging war on the traditional feudal Catholic hierarchy. The Jesuits being communistic by their order&#39;s nature were opposed to the caste system of the Church. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The 18th century gave rise to the Enlightenment, a movement that in some quarters was opposed to the church-run universities of which Ingolstadt was a prime example. <strong>The Jesuits gradually left the university as it sought to change with the times, until the university finally had become so secular that the greatest influence in Ingolstadt was Adam Weishaupt, founder of the secret society of the Illuminati.</strong> On November 25, 1799, the elector Maximilian IV announced that the university&#39;s depleted finances had become too great a weight for him to bear: the university would be moved to Landshut as a result. The university finished that year&#39;s school term, and left Ingolstadt in May 1800, bringing to a quiet end the school that had, at its peak, been one of the most influential and powerful institutes of higher learning in Europe. In 1826 King Ludwig I moved the university to the capital Munich (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich). The modern successor of Bavaria&#39;s oldest university is the WFI - Ingolstadt School of Management (founded in 1989 as part of the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt), one of Germany&#39;s foremost business schools.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. There is no recorded instance of crypto-Judaism among the Jesuits. What you are referring to are conversos. But the tolerance for their admittance ended in 1593 which saw the Jesuits banning Jews for 350 years. See first link. As mentioned, the criteria which the Jesuits used for determining Jewish ancestry was stricter than that employed by Nazis.

    <div class="md"><p>No because first of all these people almost always refuse to acknowledge that the Jesuits and Vatican are even a problem. Many of these guys are really Catholics themselves. Leaders of the alt-Right have admitted they want to revive Rome and install ultramontane jurisdiction. Certain Jews are a problem but the Vatican is obviously where the power is, and it was the Vatican that was responsible for directing 1 billion people in a change in attitude towards the Jews in the 1960s. Some of these anti-Jewish obsessors also want to go back to pre-Christian barbarism, i.e. primitive civilization. Do you want to go live in tree houses? I don&#39;t. Many neo-Nazis are generally reprobate and degenerate as well. Thus they will be excluded from dwelling in my new nation and we will eventually conquer their people and then educate their children properly. </p>
