    <div class="md"><p>Ok kid. You&#39;ve got this consipracy thing covered. All I said was that this wasn&#39;t a slidefire and a slidefire is basically junk because you can do the same thing without it from the hip and with a little practice and technique, from the shoulder, and do just as much damage.  My interests aren&#39;t in creating carnage at all but yes there are other methods that could and would have a higher rate of carnage. It&#39;s not that difficult of a concept. For about $20 bucks in plastic and a ball bearing you can overrun pretty much any semi auto rifle and aim the thing without a bipod. I&#39;ve only spent about the last four years and about 120k on this particular subject so maybe I&#39;m skewed. Trust me. I would rather dude just didn&#39;t do his thing at all but i damn sure wish he&#39;d done it with some other method which didn&#39;t affect my revenue directly. </p>

<p>You must be a shitty shot or don&#39;t know how to properly handle the slide fire. There is a technique to it.</p>

<p>But that is completely moot because he was using bipods. So are you saying you can have substantially better accuracy with a full auto on a bipod vs a slide fire on a bipod? That is bullshit.</p>

<p>No no no. If it&#39;s not true then why would we consider it? Just because it&#39;s out there doesn&#39;t make it worth consideration.

    <div class="md"><p>So you believe the MSM narrative that he had no religious nor political affiliations? And that any source to the contrary isn&#39;t worth considering? </p>

<p>Sorry, that&#39;s not how a conspiracy forum works. Here, we realize that the truth is often hidden from us and you have to go looking for it. That doesn&#39;t mean you should necessarily <em>believe</em> any random source, but it can be considered when looking at the big picture. And if more pieces of corroborating evidence come out, it can strengthen the source&#39;s credibility.</p>

<p>I would not be surprised if this guy had some connection to ISIS or radical Islam. You have ISIS claiming that he was, and that he had an Islamic name, you have this Israeli source, and then you have the fact that his wife was originally from a majority Muslim country. Hope this helps you understand how these forums work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about Robin Williams and more recently Chester Bennington (Linkin Park)? Those two were loved by millions, had millions in the bank, yet still committed suicide due to severe depression.</p>

<p>Just because some depression is caused by a lack money, doesn&#39;t mean it all is. I&#39;m going to make a safe assumption and say that having a lot of money can also be depressing. Imagine not knowing who likes you for you, and not your money or material possessions.</p>

<p>Though I do agree that there does seem to be a lack of motive. Guess we won&#39;t really know until someone close to the accused comes forward</p>

<p>I am a millionaire so I can tell you that all of that shit you mentioned doesn&#39;t cure depression. Most other millionaires I know are miserable people. You can do awesome shit all day and still be depressed the rest of the time.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s hard to believe, but think of the last thing you bought that made you happy. It only lasted for a brief time right? The same is true for big houses, trips, cars, etc.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s not that hard to be a millionaire these days. 6.5% of American households have at least 1 millionaire living in them:</p>

<p>Do not pursue money, pursue what makes you happy (and that thing is rarely money). Money gets you out of the hole, but it doesn&#39;t lift you above the ground.</p>

<p>There is however a very direct correlation between mass shootings, fear mongering about gun control, and subsequent increases in gun/ammo sales.</p>

<p>If anyone was going to organize a mass shooting to push their goals it would be the pro-gun side, because they&#39;re the ones who benefit from them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It should be known that guns can be disassembled. So whoever continually points to this discussion about large bags being carried in, please be aware that a few high powered assault rifles with extended magazines can be broken down and put into duffle bags. 100 round barrels on bump stock rifles can dump out a lot of rounds, albeit inaccurately. The discussion about these being hard to obtain is incorrect. Bump stocks are a loophole item of sorts but are not difficult to obtain if you&#39;re in a place where they&#39;re more easily obtained. 
READ. A bump stock tactical rifle is NOT a full auto &quot;machine gun.&quot; Semantics are very important here. 
A cart from the lobby could carry these bags. Like it carries everyone else&#39;s bags.
It wouldn&#39;t be difficult to carry 10 guns on a single cart from the garage to room, in luggage bags as conspicuous as anyone else&#39;s.</p>

Ammo is heavy but every hotel in that area has a cart for luggage.  and he could have gone out and bought some of this stuff while in vegas and brought it in pieces at a time.

<p>Found this link interestingly enough, goes along with the detached tweets Hillary Clinton sent out after the shooting. As well as different video sources showing what looks to be muzzle flashes from a room on the 4th floor. Listening to the weapon itself it&#39;s easy to tell that this was not an automatic weapon, as an automatic weapon can empty a 30 round clip in under 5 seconds, let alone the fact that one man that was interviewed claimed his buddy was shot 3 times in the chest... Think a 10 inch grouping (automatic or semi with a handcrank system) would be nearly impossible from the distance. </p>

<p>I mean, the whole thing is quite insane.</p>

<p>But at 350+ yards distant, automatic fire getting a grouping of three shots on a single person&#39;s chest. I woulda thought the gun would be shaking all over the place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost certainly. I won&#39;t name names, but there are people working in certain rural cities in 3rd world countries, where there are local conflicts, who basically sell &quot;tours&quot; to millionaires, where they set POWs loose in an uninhabited area with natural boundaries (think of Holes) and the client goes out and kills these people. Sometimes they do this with criminals who were going to executed anyway.</p>

<p>Now the ones they really don&#39;t tell you about (I shouldn&#39;t even mention them) are the police agencies (several in the USA) who actually allow &quot;ride alongs&quot; with wealthy billionaires who pretend to be cops and get the chance to kill those black guys you hear about who get unjustly killed. Not all of them are billionaires, of course, but sometimes they are. Sometimes they&#39;re just Russian agents who infiltrate US police forces in order to create racial/ethnic strife.

<p>That is the ultimate source of most of the commentary we see surrounding incidents like this.  </p>

<p>People don&#39;t like to think that a nihilistic prick might just start shooting for <em>no good reason</em> because that means we can&#39;t do anything about it.  </p>

<p>This strong need for control becomes more or less pathological, leading to cart-before-horse reasoning and leaps of logic.

<p>Lol, the concept of conspiracy theories was invented because there&#39;s been a history of conspiracies since as long as anyone can remember. The CIA embraced the term while turning it derogatory via various psy-ops to mock people questioning their manufactured narrative.</p>

<p>Again, people would rather believe an idiot did some shit than finding out WW2 never ended and we&#39;re controlled by literal Nazis. </p>

<p>The reason people are choosing to believe in conspiracies is not because the &quot;problem&quot; is easier to solve (it&#39;s not) -- it&#39;s because the alternative lacks any kind of motivation. At least with 9/11 it was about our freedom.</p>

<p>How it is highly secure? Have you ever been to a Vegas Casino? There aren&#39;t metal detectors or security checkpoints. They&#39;re huge with 3000+ rooms. Thousands of people coming and going every day. There is tons of surveillance but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re secure. Look up a few of the high profile casino robberies over the years. They are not secure. Vulnerable would be a more accurate description. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about Robin Williams and more recently Chester Bennington (Linkin Park)? Those two were loved by millions, had millions in the bank, yet still committed suicide due to severe depression.</p>

<p>Just because some depression is caused by a lack money, doesn&#39;t mean it all is. I&#39;m going to make a safe assumption and say that having a lot of money can also be depressing. Imagine not knowing who likes you for you, and not your money or material possessions.</p>

<p>Though I do agree that there does seem to be a lack of motive. Guess we won&#39;t really know until someone close to the accused comes forward</p>

Ammo is heavy but every hotel in that area has a cart for luggage.  and he could have gone out and bought some of this stuff while in vegas and brought it in pieces at a time.
