<p>He said they would get him, they got him, and still hardly anyone connected the fucking dots. They just blindly regurgitated the mainstream narrative that “lol Ye gone crazy bro”.</p>

<p>One of the biggest artists on the planet, who is definitely involved with the elites, literally tells us to our face that everything we know is a lie, and people STILL couldn’t do it. They just couldn’t break the conditioning.</p>

<p>I lost hope a while ago. We’re far too gone. The NWO will come, but I will be gone when it does. Either by suicide or because they’ll kill anyone who refuses to be “chipped” or whatever crazy control mechanism they have planned for us peasants. Either way I won’t be here.</p>

<p>Thanks for trying, Kanye but all it did was get you mkultra’d. I’m sorry 99% of people are too dumbed down to see you weren’t insane, but instead rediscovered your soul and were being 100% genuine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL Kanye West. Im&#39;a just leave this here.</p>

<p>Kanye always had issues. Watch his early Interviews with Sway, you can tell he is not too bright, inarticulate, and more than a little off. He was trying to push a little bit of a gay agenda and about to fall out of the closet at one point. But he reeled it back in when it became clear Sway wasn’t having any. </p>

<p>With a team of credited writers on every album and “earning” producer credits for approving a rhythm section on a track, his talent is debatable. He certainly can’t sing. He is not a wordsmith. When Nick Cannon is ghost writing for you, there is a problem. Most of his tracks sound phoned in and have no heart behind the voice. His antics, performing Niggers in Paris 17 times in a row (in Paris), then trying to force a wheelchair-bound concert goer to stand. Going off on rants then leaving the venue after only a couple of “songs”. He certainly isn’t a professional.</p>

<p>“Kums” faux robbery experience in France, the failed ticket sales for the rest of that tour. Yes Texas was packed but everything after that, tickets were going for half price and still couldn’t fill %40 of the seats. Prior to going on tour he was begging for money on Twitter. LMFAO He was trying to pull one over on the Insurance company to re-coup. </p>

<p>Regardless of what stans think, Kanye is a complete simp. He “married” a woman who drank urine on video tape. The marriage you saw in Italy it is not real on paper. Kanye and Kim do not live together.  Kanye has been linked to Ricardo Tucci (spelling). Sure he “dated” Amber Rose she was cramming fingers in his ass. Kanye even ranted about that at a concert. Kanye at the very best is bisexual but mostly a classic self-loather, closet case with a humongous ego. He claims to still mourn the loss of his mother who died from plastic surgery. Look at his wife. She goes for treatments regularly. He says and does nothing. Because he could care less about his beard.  I am not saying being gay is a bad but think about what goes on in his head. </p>

<p>“I am a big bad rapper. I keep it real but - I like the cock and my marriage is a sham?” </p>

<p>or</p>

<p>&quot;I am such a musical genius I put out all the best tracks - i never wrote.&quot;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me started on the failed fashion line. Just look at those clothes. They are not designed. Levis jean jackets from the 80&#39;s - No no I am not going to go there. That would take up another wall of text. </p>

<p>This guy was always a ticking time bomb and headed for a breakdown. He did not need any type of MK-Ultra or “Illuminate” shit to push or manipulate him.   </p>

<p>Op paints a picture of Kanye being some victim of MK Ultra for spreading &quot;common knowledge&quot; and says the media is painting him as a lunatic. I am just here to say that is not true. Kanye is considered by most to be that fruity loony rapper. </p>

<p>What Kanye said in his rant is true but it wasn&#39;t anything any middle-schooler who popped into to r/conspiracy for 20 minutes 2 years ago wouldn&#39;t already know.  </p>

<p>OP is saying Kanye is influential, a great artist and most importantly  the media is trying to make him look like a lunatic.
That he somehow has been MK-Ultra-ed. </p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t be further form the truth. Most people see him as a lunatic. He IS a simp, he IS easily manipulated, and he was trying to pull of an insurance scam by getting 5150-ed. </p>

<p>Damn, you gave yourself away. People who think like you always do.
Let me guess: You hate that &#39;rap crap&#39;. It&#39;s not &#39;even music&#39;, &#39;they&#39; should just take it back to &#39;their&#39; side of town. Also, &#39;it&#39;s not race, it&#39;s culture&#39; and &#39;all lives matter&#39;.</p>

<p>He&#39;s just overexcited about knowing how the system works and that people are sheep who are just complacent enough to keep continually bleeding money upward and believing in what they&#39;re told, but of none of it is revelating.  The interesting part is just that he&#39;s actually saying it out loud and somehow getting away with it, which usually isn&#39;t the case.  He might be dumb, which is why is bites the hands that feed him, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Kanyes case it&#39;s a little different. His stint at the looney bin was an attempt to recoup lost ticket sales. He was 5150-ed not because of the rant but because he showed up the next day at his &quot;personal trainers&quot; acting more off than usual - talking about &quot;if police show up someones going to get hurt&quot; . Just a botched attempt at an poorly executed insurance scam. Lloyd&#39;s of London is not going to pat that fool.</p>

<p>Ok even if this was true (its not) there weren&#39;t any ticket sales after Texas. 5000 seat venues had tickets going to for %50 off and couldn&#39;t fill 1/2 of it. The tour was a financial failure. Enter the insurance claim. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s great that he&#39;s at least trying to push some of these ideas towards his audience...but let&#39;s not hold Kanye up as someone we should actually look to for serious insight or intelligence/understanding about these things. There are plenty of prominent intellectuals out there who do a MUCH better job of articulating these underlying problems of society because that&#39;s what they spend much of their lives researching and understanding...rather than building a clothing/music/media empire or whatever Kanye spends most of his time consumed by.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember too, Kanye was instrumental in the tide of public opinion turning against Bush during Katrina. I will ALWAYS have his back for having the bravery to say &quot;George Bush doesn&#39;t care about black people.&quot; He was also starting to make noise about a possible future political career. The PTB had legitimate reasons to take him out. And I have to admit, my first reaction to the pics after his hospitalization was &quot;that&#39;s not him&quot;. It&#39;s hard for me to disregard that feeling.</p>

<p>Am I saying he&#39;s not a little looney tunes? Of course not- he clearly has a classic artistic temperament, lots of up-and-down and passion. That&#39;s where good art comes from. That doesn&#39;t mean he needed the &quot;treatment&quot; he&#39;s received, or that it wasn&#39;t abusive. A person with apparent mental health issues is vulnerable to abuse of power, because it provides a justification for breaching their human rights in a punitive way. That doesn&#39;t make it the true reason though- just cover. </p>

<p>Kanye was foolish enough to announce a possible future political career but realized he can barely articulate or read from a teleprompter. </p>

<p>You can be intelligent and not have an education. Especially in todays climate. In fact, the education system today has been dumbed down beyond belief. They are nothing more that cultural marxist indoctrination centers. </p>

Wait for the big &quot;you&#39;ll see&quot; Trump happening.. and then pay attention to the timing, content, and release date of Kanye&#39;s new album.

<p>It&#39;s truly good vs evil. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a former Democrat that broke the conditioning in 2016. Before that, I would&#39;ve said Kanye is crazy, he&#39;s lost his mind. Now I know better. Everything he said should be a huge eye opener, yet people allow their politics to get in the way. He explained why Hillary failed, that she relied on an old system and had no vision, and even said google and Facebook lied. That is 100% true. </p>

With that said I think the guy went outside of his bounds due to having a stressful career and not getting enough sleep. Also the guy is married to a fucking kardashian, all of this conspiracy shit he spitballs is just for media attention and keeping his name in the media.

<p>Whether Kanye is bipolar or not is irrelevant to me in this rant  (he very well could be i agree with you that he has shown bipolar symptoms)</p>

<p>Kanye is speaking the truth in regards to what is going on behind the scenes in this country and in doing so is risking his life. I know because I have done the same thing he did (albeit on a much less public platform than Kanye) and have dealt with the same people Kanye is dealing with. I have told my story of exactly what happened on here before and the top rated replies in the couple of times i have are calling me schizophrenic and that i need to take meds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The theme in The Matrix is that people are given a world that has its ups and also downs, so that people have things to get angry about and then do stuff and be happy again. They are complacent with this while having their bodies&#39; energy harvested. </p>

<p>In reality it&#39;s sort of money instead of energy.  Not even really that but ultimately the labor we are complacent with doing.  The infrastructure that we build and maintain for the elite 1% class to enjoy while the rest settle for shitty apartments, iPhones, Xbox, etc. That is what I think is being implied. Spoonfed just enough to keep people shuffling along picking up impulse buys while feeling marginally threatened but ultimately safe in the system&#39;s hands if they stick to the rules. </p>

<p>That is really what The Matrix is about - not the simulation piece.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, I am 100% on board with believing everything Kanye is saying. I&#39;ve dealt with the same people he is dealing with.</p>

<p>to be honest, I&#39;ve given up on telling people exactly what is going on because we have been conditioned to deny what is going on. you have to figure it out yourself.</p>

<p>but, if you want to &quot;wake up&quot; from the matrix you have to understand there comes a great risk with that, and if you do not have a strong spiritual foundation when waking up from the matrix the darkness can consume you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Similar to dave Chappelle and his breakdown and sudden isolation.  Then he comes back hinting at Hollywood agendas, but is very vague. Now all of a sudden his comedy routines have changed and he seems to be a different person. Makes you wonder how many more elites break down when they realize the truth behind the dynamics of Hollywood propaganda. These are just the few that actually get the chance to speak out to the media before they get shut down.  Also makes you wonder about the suspicious deaths of celebrities. IMO it goes further than just Hollywood propaganda being force fed to us. And more to the agenda they have of molding society into a dumb, shallow, mass that can&#39;t think for ourselves. </p>

<p>but something very sinister and similar has happened to me, when it first happened I tried to tell people but was just labeled crazy.</p>

<p>All I will say is targeted individuals are real, gangstalking is real, and the synagogue of satan is real.</p>

<p>Trump wasn&#39;t kidding when he said this is the calm before the storm... Get ready, things are going to get a lot worse and I truly believe the only thing that can save us is Christ himself.</p>
