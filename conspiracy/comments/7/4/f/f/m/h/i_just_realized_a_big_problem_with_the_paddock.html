        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I saw an interview with his brother where the brother claim that Stephen got rich gambling - specifically slots.  </p>

<p>Guess what?  It is impossible to be good at slots.  There is absolutely nothing you can to get better at slots.  If you play slots over time you will lose.  That&#39;s how casinos make their money.  That is why people with a gambling problem go broke and end up in debt.  </p>

<p>Often times when someone claims they have gambling winnings it is a way to launder money they obtained by other illegal means.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this proves a conspiracy.  Simply that the idea that he made money playing slots is hard to buy, and the idea that he became wealthy playing slots is preposterous.  </p>

<p>So where did this guy get his money?  Some sort of illegal activity.  It seems he was leading a double life.</p>

<p>interesting read, breaks down a good deal of whats known about him and his gambling habits.  article says the average payout is around 91%.  Good players can raise those odds.  Paddock played for big comps and to offset any losses.  You spend 10K, lose 1K but get comped rooms, shows and meals you&#39;re coming out ahead depending on what kind of comps you&#39;re getting.</p>

You can&#39;t beat any of the games, they watch everyone so closely the moment they thought you were &quot;beating the game&quot; you&#39;d get kicked out. And any time of &quot;sleight of hand&quot; bullshit you see in the movies won&#39;t happen.

    <div class="md"><p>A person who said he was a former neighbour for about seven months claimed Paddock was a regular at a nearby local bar who&#39;d routinely come in to for a few drinks and to play the video slot machine there. Said he himself and one of his crew were former marines who often visited the same bar for drinks after work and had met and had had numerous friendly conversations with Paddock every so often. Although he and his workmate sometimes discussed guns with Paddock present he showed no particular interest or any kind of specific knowledge about them. He also maintained that Paddock was an easy-going guy who happened to favour Trump before the election. Obviously he doesn&#39;t believe the official narrative. This was on a call-in show that the only follow-up has been that the police very much want to talk to this guy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the Atlantis in Reno, Mr. Paddock would often move to a machine when somebody using it got up to take a break. “That would annoy people and he did not seem to care at all,” Mr. Weinreich said. “He acted like ‘these machines are for me.’”</p>

<p>Mr. Paddock was also a “starer,” Mr. Weinreich said.</p>

<p>“He loved to stare at other people playing,” he said. “It was not a good thing because it would make other VIPs in the high-limit area uncomfortable.”</p>

It&#39;s a constant transfer of money between the player and the casino. It&#39;s a lifestyle littered with &quot;comps&quot; that give the player the illusion that they are living a luxurious and profitable lifestyle, but it&#39;s a numbers game and the casinos will take most players money a majority of the time. However, there will always be players who end up on top over the years, these people are certainly &quot;outliers&quot; in terms of probability and Stephen Paddock may have very well been one of these people. </p>

<p>I have a friend who used to write slot software (now leads the IT dept. at a local casino). According to him, it&#39;s much more than just RNG and math. He never gave me many details but he did say that, for example, the systems he worked on were rigged to never pay out high amounts two spins in a row -- whether the spins were on the same machine, or machines near each other. He also said his systems were rigged to make a row of slots appear more lucky to draw crowds. </p>

<p>He did this software many years ago, so it may have changed now (laws have tightened on this stuff, I understand). </p>

<p>My uncle is good at slots. He surveys the slot area and checks for the slot addicts. Its easy to recognise this people. He studies them and using their machine choices he decides which machines pay up and which ones are not worth even touching. </p>

<p>He has various methods for deciding. One of the most obvious one is this. When he sees someone playing for a really long time and not winning much. He takes note. If he leaves without winning mayor price my uncle steps in and plays in the same machine. He almost always wins. </p>

<p>We not rich and casinos are forbidden in my country, but whenever we go abroad we always go to the casino and make decent cash. So I know for a fact there is a way to make money on slots. </p>
