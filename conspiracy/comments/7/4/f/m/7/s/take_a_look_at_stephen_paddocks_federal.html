        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Looks like got his first federal job (at a post office) in 1976 (<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/04/las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-had-government-jobs-bought-33-weapons-last-year.html">http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/04/las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-had-government-jobs-bought-33-weapons-last-year.html</a>), which is the year his Dad was captured. Maybe a job was part of the deal with the FBI to rat out his Dad&#39;s whereabouts, along with who knows what else. In case you are not aware his Dad was on the run for nearly 2 decades after escaping from prison (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Hoskins_Paddock">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Hoskins_Paddock</a>) and it sounds like he almost held the record as the longest ever on the FBI most wanted list. So obviously the FBI had a lot of motivation to save face and finally capture him.</p>

<p>For the crimes his Dad committed (including multiple bank robberies, attempted murder of an FBI agent, and prison escape) it looks like he ended up serving very little time after he was caught. This leads me to believe Stephen cut another deal with the FBI to get his Dad out early - perhaps in agreeing to go undercover doing their dirty work. This scenario would explain his federal employment, lack of close friends, moving around so much, and general lack of information.</p>

<p>Further I believe they were able to somehow leverage him (perhaps via threatening his Girlfriend or Family) to plan and take part in this false flag event. It now seems evident that there were multiple people involved and it did not go as planned. I do not care to theorize any further but I do think we need to take a closer look at his exact federal government employment hiring / quitting dates along with his Dad&#39;s arrest / release dates - if those are public record. If we could find any strong circumstantial evidence of previous relationship with the FBI this whole story would start to make a lot more sense. </p>

<p>It&#39;s highly unlikely they leveraged their loyal long term employee who, by your theory, ratted out his own dad to the FBI. If the FBI was involved then it&#39;s probably arms deal gone wrong.</p>

<p>The time frame of his gun purchases (Starting in October when Trump was in Reno) and the fact that he was still angry enough to carry out the attack after Trump won leads me to believe he was probably a die hard anti-Trumper.  Pure speculation though.</p>

<p>I already told you though, fuck off.  It is clear that you are not here to discuss anything.  You are here trying to drive a narrative and discount people&#39;s theories.

<p>To respond to what you believe to be a cogent point, there has been plenty of information posted on 4Chan that was true.  The photos of the crime scene that were leaked?  They were leaked <strong>to 4Chan</strong>.  <em>That is where they came from.</em> I verified this myself the day they were leaked.  On that day, they existed nowhere else on the web <em>but</em> 4Chan.</p>

<p>So, now that your argument that 4Chan is never a credible source is no longer credible, let me ask you again...  </p>

<p>Why is it important to you to argue <em>against</em> it being Antifa?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently he began investing in real estate many years ago, and ended up a multimillionaire. Also, there are reports that he had several big wins at various casinos over the years, although who knows how much he actually spent gambling before he won sizeable amounts.</p>

<p>He possibly saved up money from the postal service job he had about 40 years ago, and other jobs he had over the years, to start buying real estate. I have known a few people personally who came from modest means, but saved up money from working average jobs, invested it wisely and ended up quite wealthy.  It&#39;s not all that uncommon, especially for someone from Stephen Paddock&#39;s generation. Remember that people of his generation were typically the children of those who grew up during the Great Depression. Saving your money and being smart with it became ingrained in them, and they taught this to their kids.</p>

<p>People act like the fact that the shooter didn&#39;t have a job <em>presently</em> means that he had some sinister way of earning an income. That&#39;s ridiculous. The man was in his 60&#39;s and according to several news accounts, he profited big in real estate over several decades.  This isn&#39;t unusual. And why would he keep working if he didn&#39;t have to or want to? I know I wouldn&#39;t keep working if I were in that kind of a financial position! Maybe he also owned stocks that paid dividends which supplemented his income.</p>

<p>It may be eventually discovered that he was also involved in some sort of shady side hustle. But for now, his being a successful real estate investor seems completely plausible to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re doing an attack where the cops are inevitably going to come, setting up cameras is a logical thing to do. With the 20+ guns that are dupes, if you&#39;re doing that kind of shooting spree then keeping a bunch of guns you&#39;re familiar with pre-loaded so you don&#39;t even have to change the magazines would save some time. Good point about the full autos though, true they&#39;d be more of a heat score.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the FBI cuts a deal with Stephen to rat out his dad and he gets a job with the post office, which is more like a punishment than an actual reward. And then, somehow, Stephen, as a post office worker, now has the pull to get his dad out of jail early? That makes absolutely no sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes no sense? If you are a broke College kid and the FBI offers you a decent paying job and other benifits if you tell them where your POS Dad is, you would not consider it?</p>

<p>After his postal job he went on to work as a defense contract auditor for the IRS and accountant for Lockheed Martin. These are jobs where you would could very well learn things that could provide leverage. I would say based on his last 2 jobs his frequent moving his undercover work involved arms and/or drug trafficking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This kinda lines up with my thinking that he was there for an arms deal, working either with the FBI or was the person they were trying to entrap. Something went wrong though and he or whoever did this went nuts. That’s why so many weapons were there, it was a trade. Also would explain the cameras. Also we now know it was where the Saudis were staying recently, they could be linked. FBI could be trying to save their own skin by pinning the blame on him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems on the surface that is it weird how he got an IRS job if his dad was a public enemy and mentally unstable. I have given character references to friends who apply for alphabet agencies, and it seems you can&#39;t get hired if ANYTHING in your background is shady. For example, if you have too much debt, you could fail the background check. Political posts on Facebook against a president? Disqualified. Back in the 1970s, I imagine the IRS would be even more strict and discriminatory than today. So it is baffling how they could hire him since his dad was such an enemy of the state.</p>
