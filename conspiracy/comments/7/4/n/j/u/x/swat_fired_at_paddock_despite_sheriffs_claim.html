        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>ELI5 Edit:  Sheriff says SWAT didnt fire during breach, officer says they did during radio call in.  Officer immediately told to switch to a different channel.</p>

<p>I stumbled on this at the end of my other thread, about the second door breach, and thought this was big enough to deserve its own thread.  </p>

<p>Sheriff states SWAT did not fire during the breach, and the gunman was self inflicted.  </p>

<p>Zebra-20, the police officer callsign reporting on the SWAT raid, gives the following, roughly transcribed call after the breach was over.  Emphasis added by me.  </p>

<p>&quot;We don&#39;t need anybody else up on this floor, break. This floor is clear, it has cleared by swat team with two breaches, WE DID HAVE ONE SWAT OFFICER THAT DID FIRE, we have negative injuries on anybody else. We have multiple firearms up here, from where they were shooting out of, but we just have one suspect down at this time.&quot; </p>

<p>He then gets called over to the SWAT 1 channel, to get him off the public channel. Thats the last we hear of zebra-20. Time linked video below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xAcTKNpDeY&amp;amp;t=01h20m16s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xAcTKNpDeY&amp;amp;t=01h20m16s</a></p>

<p>Its very interesting to hear a direct report that SWAT fired during the breach, but the official story says otherwise.  The officer also says &quot;where they were shooting&quot; but that could just be his assumption that there were two shooters, without having any evidence.  </p>

<p>EDIT 1: Here is the timstamped video of the direct question &quot;did the officers fire back at all&quot; and the Sheriff, twice, says pointedly &quot;no&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyfa-A15FeQ&amp;amp;t=34m14s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyfa-A15FeQ&amp;amp;t=34m14s</a></p>

<p>EDIT 2: Timestamps</p>

<p>1:11:23 - &quot;breach breach breach&quot; explosion, main door breach</p>

<p>1:12:02 - 2 shots reported fired near park area of NY, NY, also 1 at Aria</p>

<p>1:14:10 - Zebra 20 reports they are clearing room, 1 suspect down</p>

<p>1:16:03 - Zebra 20 checks back in to confirm 1 down in 32-135, they have the floor</p>

<p>1:16:53 - Zebra 20 announces new breach into adjoining room in 5 seconds</p>

<p>1:17:13 - Reports of shots fired from Tropicana</p>

<p>1:18:00 - Zebra 20 reports east room cleared, 1 suspect down, multiple firearms, definitely where they were firing into the crowd</p>

<p>1:19:43 - Someone requests callsign of who was in 32-135</p>

<p>1:19:50 - Zebra 20 asks for message</p>

<p>1:20:17 - Zebra 20 says &quot;We don&#39;t need anybody else up on this floor, break. This room is clear, it has been cleared by SWAT with two breaches.  We did have one SWAT officer that did fire.  We have negative injuries on anybody else. Just to confirm, we have multiple firearms up here from where they were shooting out from, and we just have one suspect down at this point in time.&quot;</p>

<p>1:20:48 previous Zebra 20 comment ends</p>

<p>1:20:51 - 206 Zebra calls into Zebra 20 &quot;can you come over to SWAT 1 please, and come up on the channel&quot;</p>

<p>1:21:05 - Zebra 20 confirms   </p>

<p>EDIT 3: 
I&#39;m also confused about the 200 shots through the door theory.  The visible part of the door in the hallway certainly didnt look like 200 shots had been fired through it.  The sheriff stated that clearly visible gun (because the door is blown off its hinges) was initially seen by police because they could see through the massive hole blown int he door.  Something isn&#39;t adding up here.  Photo of the door with bullet holes : <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/10/03/17/44FFC65700000578-4944234-image-a-46_1507047333838.jpg">http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/10/03/17/44FFC65700000578-4944234-image-a-46_1507047333838.jpg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more bullshit to lead you off the trail. It doesn&#39;t matter if they fired at him or not, it DOESN&#39;T MATTER!! </p>

<p>Would anyone care if they burst through the door and shot off 1000 rounds during an active shooter? of course not, so why are we making it an issue here?</p>

<p>Whether they burst through the door shooting, whether they put a round in the top of his head as he lay dead on the floor to make sure he wasn&#39;t going to suicide vest them or pop up and start blasting, none of it matters, it has nothing to do with the real questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do we know it was a lie and not a mistake? again, what does it matter if they shot him or he shot himself? none of that helps us understand the motive and who might have been involved. </p>

<p>I think stupid angles like this distract from more important details, why waste time on something so useless to the investigation? Maybe the SWAT guy was nervous and fired of a round as they went in, have you ever stormed a room where there could be who know how many shooters with who knows what kind of weapons and who knows what else to kill you?</p>

<p>The SWAT guys aren&#39;t the problem, they did their job as they were told. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How in anyway is that useless? If they shot him instead of Paddock killing himself that means that there was a window of ~55 minutes or where Paddock was in the room with ample ammunition to continue his rampage or attempt an escape. </p>

<p>If he didn&#39;t kill himself:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why would he not continue shooting?</li>
<li>Why would he not attempt an escape?</li>
<li>What was he doing for that window of time before SWAT arrived?</li>
<li>Why would they lie that Paddock killed himself if he didn&#39;t?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you shot before? seems he did it without ear protection of any kind, he was also old and weak. He probably was def from all the bullets and in pain from violent recoil, which explains the long pauses between bursts. </p>

<p>If he was in good shape and used protection, he could have gone rifle to rifle in seconds, but he didn&#39;t, because using those weapons like that will really fuck you up if you aren&#39;t prepared. </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t attempt escape for any number of reasons, his conspirators fucked him and left him as the lone target, or he realized his idea of escape was silly and that he was trapped. </p>

<p>As far as what he did for XX amount of minutes, first of all, the two shots happen shortly after the rapid fire ends, so likely it was only minutes before he tried to kill himself, or otherwise he was sitting there contemplating all that happened and what the options were, was he going to fight it out with police for as long as he could? or was he going to just off himself?</p>

<p>No.  It&#39;s not.  .223 Remington is literally the smallest rifle cartridge in general use.  It has the lowest recoil of just about any widely available rifle cartridge there is.</p>

I&#39;m to believe they flew 15 feet from the window while he was shooting and then repelled blood as it coagulated underneath them? Honest questions. So much of this baffles the shit out of me. </p>

<p>If his objective was to kill whoever was on the other side of the DOUBLE doors and he fired an excess of 200 rounds, wouldn&#39;t there be bullet holes on both doors? </p>

<p>How is it possible that the cop was only shot once out of those 200 rounds? </p>

<p>If we look at where he was apparently shooting from, and where the entrance is located, he&#39;d have to go out of his way to fire those 200 rounds, come back to his original spot and then shoot himself?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCB-8cFRcCY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCB-8cFRcCY</a> Was he planning on continuing the shooting spree on the concert goers, after he unloaded the 200 rounds? </p>

<p>On the scanner, the cop says that he has a female that was shot in the mouth???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t hear that part in the press conference. Interesting. All I know is the security company rep the guard worked for said he was shot while walking down the hall, not that he ever saw the door ajar. But most stories about the guard I&#39;ve seen are generally inconsistent and odd. But the guard has a hispanic name and hasn&#39;t given any interviews. The only things he&#39;s quoted as saying are &quot;i was just doing my job&quot; and &quot;fine&quot; when asked how he was. I assume he doesn&#39;t speak good English and either things are messed up in translation or people are putting words in his mouth.</p>

Once you go in, there is a common area with couches that are next to the windows, maybe a mini bar as well.  To either side of the common area is a bedroom, each with its own door and much like a standard hotel room.  Again with windows all along one side.

<p>As for the different blood pools - the first one that is dried up was likely the first wound from the back of the head. The second is post mortem pooling from his mouth. You can see the trails from over the right eye and left cheek.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first reports from hours the sheriff said they were unsure of if he was killed by an officer. I don&#39;t remember reading about the suicide untill later.</p>

<p>The officer simply said 1 member fired. That doesn&#39;t mean he hit anyone and could explain why it took hours to say is he was already dead when they entered. Because shots were reported they would have to wait for AARs and debriefs before confirming if the shots fired were the fatal ones. </p>

<p>Room clearing is intense. Could have been nerves and bad trigger discipline  (a negligent discharge) or got spokes by a jacket hanging on a wall.</p>

<p>Just an alternate view.</p>
