<p>Granted, we&#39;re not there to conclude this of Stephen Paddock but right now, there is absolutely no evidence to indicate it&#39;s anything else. No occult ritual. No crisis actors. No arms deal gone bad. No second, third or tenth shooter. Just one messed up gambling addict who was sick of living and wanted to go out with a bang.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what we need to know:</p>

<p>What did the note say? What was the motive?
Where is the footage of him in the casino, on the floor of his room  or in the parking garage?</p>

<p>Only two questions I need to know. Then we might just have to admit in the end, we&#39;re defending a deranged, evil lunatic. The tough part of being a conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>You seem to be pretty set on the msm narrative and pretty ignorant (willfully or not) of the inconsistencies and anomalies in, among other things, the public statement given by the LVPD sheriff to the reporters.</p>

<p>Vegas casinos are defintely highly surveillanced but again, he was a local resident and could easily make trips to take guns and ammo to the room with his suitaces. </p>

<p>As for people there, they have no clue regarding sound dynamics of a gun shot. How the bullet breaks the sound barrier and creates an echo that is further magnified by the highly elaborate structured casinos around the Mandalay Bay. What they heard most likely was echos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never heard the expression Gamblers never win?</p>

<p>They don&#39;t. It&#39;s a sickness. Most athletes go broke because they&#39;re degernative gamblers. He may have won 40,000 video poker but I&#39;m sure he lost it right back and more. It&#39;s not about being smart. The house always wins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They win and then they lose. House always wins period. That would be called statistics. Unless you&#39;re a professional poker player investing thousands in tournaments and taking huge risks and then winning lump sums once in awhile.

    <div class="md"><p>Poker players make a lot of money playing cash games as well.  Sports bettors make more than poker players.  You can beat slot machines video poker and blackjack in some casinos.  You can bet on horses or dogs and make money.</p>

<p>You can make prop bets.  You can beat street dice games.  You can hustle pool.  There&#39;s actually many ways people can and do make money gambling.</p>

<p>Life is a gamble.  Every time you cross the street you gamble.  Which school to go to, career to enter, significant other to marry are all huge gambles.  Most decisions are some kind of gamble. </p>

<p>The trick to life isn&#39;t to avoid gambling.  It&#39;s to learn how to gamble well.</p>
