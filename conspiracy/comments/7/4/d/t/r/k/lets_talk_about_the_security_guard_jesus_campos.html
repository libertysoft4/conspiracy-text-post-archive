        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>According to the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/unarmed-security-guard-jesus-campos-took-on-las-vegas-killer-stephen-paddock">Daily Beast</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Campos first arrived on the 32nd floor, he did so by elevator because Paddock had somehow blocked stairwell doors leading to the hallway outside of his room, Hickey said. The door to the room itself was also barricaded, Campos found when he tried to open it, just before the bullets came through the door.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet this article from <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/las-vegas-shooter-how-many-rounds-shots-bullets-hotel-mandalay-bay-2017-10">Business Insider</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the 32 nd floor, noticing an ajar door, the security guard began approaching and was then hit by some of the hundreds of bullets Paddock fired into the hallway. Police, who had been checking the 31 st floor, arrived “in a matter of seconds” to find the security guard at 10.17pm, who was able to identify the shooter’s room. Despite earlier reports that Paddock had cameras set up in the hallway and in his doors’s peephole police now say the cameras weren’t in use at the time of the shooting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So which one was it? Was the door locked or ajar? Where the cameras working or not? Why are they no pictures of Jesus Campos?</p>

<p>My guess is that the security guard was actually the shooter, Paddock was a patsy </p>

<p>None of this seems consistent or adds up. Also why haven&#39;t we heard from the security guard? If he&#39;s the one that prompted Paddock to kill himself shouldn&#39;t he be a sort of hero that stopped the massacre from getting worse?</p>

<p>He is a hero. He didn&#39;t cause Paddock to kill himself, but after the encounter he went into barricade mode and stopped his madness on the festival. Jesus saved countless lives that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory regarding Jesus Campos and this is actually extremely plausible. </p>

<p>Campos is asking people to evacuate on the 32nd floor. He approaches the entrance to 32135 and receives a hail of gunfire. He falls to the ground knowing only that he&#39;s hit. At this point the two actual shooters leave and Campos doesn&#39;t see them (perhaps they leave from the Adjoining Room door). In this scenario Paddock is already dead on the floor killed by the actual shooters. Campos being a low level security guard embellishes a few details making the whole experience sound more significant than it was (I wouldn&#39;t blame him as this has been known to happen in situations like this all the time). </p>

<p>This would explain the inconsistency of certain details and how the real shooters escaped undetected. This would also explain why no one heard Paddock&#39;s suicide.</p>

<p>See the door to the hallway on the left that goes to the room labeled &quot;Hotel Room&quot;- that&#39;s the second room Paddock had in his name. That&#39;s where the 2nd broken window was. Under this theory if Campos was incapacitated around the area labeled &quot;entrance&quot; then perhaps the 2 actual shooters could&#39;ve slipped by. There still would have been people evacuating the floor so it&#39;s not impossible to think this might have been the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it was ajar because it had just been opened (because the shooters saw him on the surveillance and opened the door to fire at him). They shoot him. He falls to the ground. They leave thinking he&#39;s dead or incapacitated and everything else proceeds as has been reported, except Campos doesn&#39;t see them leave because he&#39;s incapacitated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes unconscious. I could see that happening with a security guard not used to high pressure situations like this. </p>

<p>And like I&#39;m saying maybe the only reason the door was suddenly ajar is because they saw him coming on the surveillance. There&#39;s no way (whoever the shooter/s was) that they would leave the door partially open during the whole massacre. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally plausible. I mean look at Paddock... his life over the past couple years is easily repeatable. Goes to Vegas a few times a month, gambles for hours on end, goes back to the room for the night then does it all over again for a few days in a row. He does this month after month. And with Las Vegas being his destination everything he does is on record that the FBI could tap into. They could have easily surveilled him for quite a while and learned his patterns. His loner lifestyle and gun collection at home was enough to make him an easy patsy.</p>

<p>Look at the end of the day what happened is terrible. Just the longer this goes on the more fishy it looks. </p>

<p>Not to turn this political, but its just fishy how something of this magnitude, happens at the success ( I hate using that word in this scenario) that it did without someone slipping up somewhere. It just so happened to happen after 2+ weeks of Trump getting blasted by remarks. His twitter has fallen relatively quiet the past week and this happens and he receives praise from all around how well he handled the shooting. </p>

She said that there was some group of religious protesters that stand out side of casinos and tell people that they are going to hell etc. She said that the protesters would be at the casino later ( I unfortunately forget the name of the specific casino) We laughed about it but now I wonder if religious protestors could account for the &quot;Hispanic lady&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple things came to mind for me... first the sheriff said campos approached the door because it was ajar. If that&#39;s the case then the door would have to be propped open because hotel room doors close on their own. Secondly who in their right mind would approach an active shooter situation unarmed? And finally he got shot in the leg. The sheriff said he then proceeded to help them clear rooms on the 32nd floor before making him seek medical attention. In what scenario would the police add a wounded non-police/private citizen to help clear rooms during an active shooter situation? I don&#39;t like it... </p>

<p>Things don&#39;t add up more and more. Paddock fired 200+ rounds at him and he only got hit once? The picture I seen of the outside of Paddock&#39;s room must have been stock, cause I didn&#39;t see bullet holes? If Paddock really shot 200+ rounds at a security guard, why didn&#39;t he shoot at the cops? He still had plenty of ammo on the floor.</p>

<p>Also it said that once paddock opened fire on the crowd, it took cops minutes to reach his room.... Didn&#39;t they say it took cops like an hour to reach his room?</p>
