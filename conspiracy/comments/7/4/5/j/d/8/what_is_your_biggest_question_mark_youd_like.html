    <div class="md"><p>I touched base in this in an earlier thread. Someone proposed that due to him shooting from a tow position building it could affect the echo sounds. While I believe this is possible. I highly doubt it would cause such a variation in echo, especially considering its never heard again. Also those initial shots were fired almost one after the other. I&#39;m not sure if he would of had time to fire and then run to the other window and fire again so quickly. Just my input.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read he was worth 11 million while scrolling through the subreddit. He was a retired auditor, worth 11 million, and owned 2 planes with no prior work history besides the auditor job. What do? I want to know what his connection was. I do believe it is an arms deal of some sort gone bad, the sloppiness by the government is far beyond that that is usually present on an incident like this. I think it was a big fuck up. &quot;Think&quot;. It&#39;s all speculation, but there are some mysteries about his life I want answered. Also it seems that the general consensus is that there is an underlying thing besides the &quot;one gunman&quot; thing. I don&#39;t like seeing claims about it not happening about it being a hoax, it obviously did happen. but I am satisfied in seeing people who doesn&#39;t usually question these events starting to become curious.

    <div class="md"><p>He probably planned to continue as long as he could until his set up camera showed Police approaching. When the security guard altercation happened maybe it obstructed or the dude destroyed his camera. This would take the shooter&#39;s control of the situation away so he killed himself than to ensure Police couldn&#39;t get close enough to take him alive in any way. 
My guess anyway</p>

<p>What’s the biggest thing that makes you suspicious about the shooting?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gun dealer in Arizona that came forward about selling weapons to him. </p>

<p>The fact that the worked for the IRS, USPS, and DOD. </p>

<p>The accumulating connections to the Philippines. </p>

<p>Also, it seems strange to me that the ATF spoke at the last press conference and not the FBI.</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to get the impression that he was working for the federal government (probably the ATF) and this is connected to straw sales.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, the weapons from the leaked pics don&#39;t fit the videos/what happened. I saw somewhere that there were 12 bump fire devices? Every gun I saw had an optic and either a foregrip or a bipod. Firstly, using a foregrip wouldn&#39;t allow a bump stock to operate properly. A bipod wouldn&#39;t be very stable either as the front half of the firearm would be reciprocating. The biggest question for me though is how can a person fire effectively at a full auto rate and at that distance while using both a bump stock and an optic. I get the fish in a barrel idea, but he would have had no sights at all. I don&#39;t see any offset backups, no risers or look-through scope rings. The optic would be reciprocating with every round fired. I don&#39;t believe the human eye can adjust focus that quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to know why the news coverage is playing clips of automatic fire with music soundtrack, and the swat team chatter pre going in. I want to know why the media is showing this murder in such an entertainment fashion. While Ignoring ALL of the red flags! Seems like their narratives can&#39;t touch on the real issues and are instead inciting more violence through copy cats.. see the other 2 reports of mass shootings now? Deep state is waging war on US citizens. Fuming murderers... And the media is complicit as always as they sit idle while they murder their own citizens.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got one.  Why did he kill himself after he placed a camera in the hall to catch cops coming and after shot at the door? I mean a sudden wave of realization of his actions sure...but dragging all those guns up there and planning and cameras...dont you take suicide by police at that point.  Saw it at the bird sanctuary standoff if i remember correctly. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted this for a reply a few times but it&#39;s my thinking. Just in case Police were somehow able to incompacitate him without killing him. My only example would be a fluke cop shot to the shoulder not allowing him to operate his firearm. </p>

<p>Would you not take an hour or so before and start piling up every single couch/chair/table/bed/desk/luggage/anything not tied down in front of the door to restrict the inevitable police entry or flashbang?</p>

<p>Because the police report I saw was they breached the door and came in shooting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THis might be a small detail, but i remember watching a video from within the crowd where a line of gunfire was hitting the floor as a couple of people dodged the bullets and nearly got hit.</p>

<p>But it was a closely grouped together bunch of bullets, i&#39;m talking inches away from each other. If the shooter was on the 32nd floor, that means he would have been way over 2 football fields away from the crowd, and yet his weapon has INCREDIBLE accuracy at that distance. it just seems weird to me. i was wondering if anyone else caught that.</p>
