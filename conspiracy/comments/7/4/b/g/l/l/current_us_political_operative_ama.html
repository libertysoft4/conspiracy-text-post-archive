    <div class="md"><p>Well the whole Illuminati thing is total bullshit but the actual idea of the illuminati, one group who actually has controls what happens in the world, is not very far from the reality of it all. Just instead of weird satanic stuff its just big corporations pulling their resources to make sure nothing gets in the way of their plans. Also mass surveillance is already a thing which is supported by the corporations but not so they can round us up but so they can sell us stuff, think of mass surveillance and the ultimate marketing tool to sell billions of dollars worth of goods. And A.I is something you should start looking more into. Quantum computing companies are teaming up with financial firms and other corporations and they are really pushing us to make sure no legislation is put forward that limits their abilities. They want the ability for A.I to control markets.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I&#39;ve never believed in the &quot;Illumanti&quot; so to speak but more &quot;TPTB&quot; which I think you basically nailed. I think we can all already see their marketing strategies. Almost every web page I go to has ad&#39;s for other sites and products I have been looking up recently. But I&#39;ve learned to ignore those. </p>

<p>The A.I. is something that scares me, along with 5G coming out. There will eventually have to have some sort of A.I legislation to safe guard the A.I. from becoming too self reliant and taking matters into their own hands. We all know what skynet did to humanity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see a skynet happening but hey im a politics guy not an engineer or scientist lol. I can tell you that&#39;s not what anyone wants, they just want the A.I to make money because the amount they could make is absolutely unfucking imaginable. Which is why they don&#39;t want safeguards because once the safeguards are debated then financial safeguards are put in and they don&#39;t want that. I have heard these fat fucks brag about using A.I to start wars to make more money. That&#39;s what I fear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they have and A.I makes it easier and more frequent. Its hard to pull it off with humans in control but if A.I can manipulate basically everything out there, we will see war happening every other year. Plus A.I could feasibly pinpoint when and where and among who a war should be started to make the most profit. That&#39;s not something we can do with humans. I have heard them all tell me about this when I point blank asked what they intend it to be used for and what kind of legislation do they want to be shut down and what they are okay with. Its almost sickening when you go to ask these guys about their long term goals and they brag about using tech for murder just for a profit. </p>

<p>With tech advancing and taking the place of humans on the battle field how long will it be before a military A.I. is built to oversee battlefields and make tactical decisions? Will we eventually have a fleet of UAV&#39;s ran off a single A.I. from Langley? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well what they think is it will give the US a leg up and essentially be unstoppable. Think of it like this, the world is a human body. The corporations are the brain telling the body what to do and there are very very few things the brain (coporations) doesnt have control over. In this example of the human body, the US is the strongest and most powerful part of the body thats not the brain. so the brain will rely on that part of the body to do the most important things it needs done and will do whatever it can to make that part even stronger.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure which part you were referring to but if you mean the corporations will buy actual resources (like natural ones) later, they already have.

    <div class="md"><p>Its kinda the best of both worlds. You call it fake money but that&#39;s not how the world works right now. Right now the dollar and all currency has value even if its fiat currency. So they need that money now because thats what (currently) makes the world go round. But they also have the natural resources in their back pockets for when the fiat currency is useless (if it ever is). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well my basic history is that I worked as an intern at the U.S capitol early in college. Became an intern for the Bush administration (pretty much sucked.) Then I took a small campaign job in Florida after college for the Bill McCollum campaign and we lost. Slowly kinda worked my way into the private sector. My first big project I had the lead on was when I was in the private sector and I was heading up the agricultural lobby for the KORUS-FTA. The most recent one I&#39;ll talk about was in 2010 I was still in the private sector and our client was Boeing and I worked the 2010 Saudi Arabia arms deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was still pretty young at the time when i worked on those so to get those deals it was mostly left up to the older guys above me like where I am now. But to land those kinda deals its all about who you know and what info you have on anyone and everyone around you. So its mostly just bribing people or blackmail. The saudi arms deal was the one I had some more involvement in when it came to things like bribes and blackmail. Boeing basically gave us a number and said they need at least that much to be sold so we spent time in saudi arabia negotiating on behalf of boeing and the government, and then we spent a lot of time here in the US strong arming democrats (including Obama) to make it happen. Boeing saw someone who wanted arms, they made it happen. Thats all the goal was. They wanted the sale.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really depends on the project. Sometimes its as simple as saying we wont pay for that new school in your district, to as extreme as life. It also includes gathering incriminating evidence like prostitution, child abuse, drugs, violence, and using all that against them. The corporations want the info and we get it and use it for them against politicians and other agencies and even other corporations trying to get out. for example (not my firm but others i know) there are a lot of corporations right now looking at Elon Musk and trying to find ways to end all his companies because he refuses to play the game and on top of it his companies pose a massive threat to the long term players who are resistant to adopting new tech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was so recent that I haven&#39;t really met or asked around with anyone who would be able to tell me one way or the other. There are and have been false flags I can say with certainty but I can also say its not nearly as many false flags as people out there try to claim. My personal opinion is that it may have been a quazi-false flag. Meaning this guy did it and all of what happened is true, but the reasons for doing so are a little more sinister. But again thats just my opinion and I have not done much digging into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes perfect sense. It really depends on what you fear and value more. Personally I like the theory of small government. But I can tell you its too late for that debate. It is not the government you should be concerned with anymore. Think of the US government like you think of small state and local govs. They have a little control but they have to, in the end, obey the big dog fed gov.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No nothing similar is happening today except for maybe small nations who are already in total turmoil. But on a large scale with countries like the US and in Europe, no. Defense companies are pushing so hard for more A.I to be used in warfare and to eliminate the soldier all together because it brings in so much more profit to sell drones and computers that can make strategic war decisions than it does to sell human operated machines. So the need for small armed groups is basically going away because they are being replaced.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understood. But with all infighting between the left and right and the war drums beating, where are the anti war protests and the fact that we have a shit ton of up armored vehicles being set up in Europe since 2010.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a precaution. The armored vehicles i mean. The big fear is with population increases bigger protests will happen and riots and soon citizens could challenge the government if big enough so that&#39;s really all it is. Its more of a precaution in the case of mass hysteria. Thats one of those things thats made out to be more sinister than it really is. Thats why its happening here in the US too. They fear a large population getting out of hand.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the whole Illuminati thing is total bullshit but the actual idea of the illuminati, one group who actually has controls what happens in the world, is not very far from the reality of it all. Just instead of weird satanic stuff its just big corporations pulling their resources to make sure nothing gets in the way of their plans. Also mass surveillance is already a thing which is supported by the corporations but not so they can round us up but so they can sell us stuff, think of mass surveillance and the ultimate marketing tool to sell billions of dollars worth of goods. And A.I is something you should start looking more into. Quantum computing companies are teaming up with financial firms and other corporations and they are really pushing us to make sure no legislation is put forward that limits their abilities. They want the ability for A.I to control markets.    </p>
