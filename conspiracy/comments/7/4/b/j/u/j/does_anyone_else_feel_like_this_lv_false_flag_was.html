    <div class="md"><p>dont really know if im going to be honest, just a gut feeling i have. </p>

<p>but there have been different scenarios described both here and on /pol.</p>

<p>one was that Stephen Paddock was working for the FBI in gun sale entrapment&#39;s and it went to shit, the suspect(s?) found out about it ( if so, who tipped them of ? ) and killed Paddock and then went on a killing spree.. </p>

<p>the other is that the original plans where much darker and they where stopped from achieving there goal. and went on to plan B.. create as much as chaos as possible..</p>

<p>for now this is just worlds put online by random people. but the hole scenario doesn&#39;t add up. Paddocks history,money, motive, multiple clips of the happening where you can hear people say stuff like &quot; there is two shooters, multiple shooters and so on. </p>

<p>i think they really fucked up on this one. the cat is out of the bag and there is no going back </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1 Photos of Stephen Paddock’s hotel room have been leaked, and one of those photos appears to show a suicide note. Why hasn’t the public been told what is in that note?</p>

<p>2 Were there additional shooters? A taxi driver reportedly captured video of an automatic weapon being fired out of a lower level window. A video from another angle and brief footage captured by Dan Bilzerian also seem to confirm that automatic gunfire was coming from a floor much lower than the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock was located on. And if you weren’t convinced by the first three videos, this fourth video should definitely do it.</p>

<p>3 Why were law enforcement authorities discussing “another suspect on the fourth floor”, and why isn’t the mainstream media talking about this?</p>

<p>4 As Jon Rappoport has pointed out, it would have been impossible for Stephen Paddock to kill and wound 573 people in less than five minutes of shooting with the kinds of weapons that he is alleged to have used. So why won’t law enforcement authorities acknowledge this fact?</p>

<p>5 How in the world did Paddock get 42 guns and “several thousand rounds of ammo” into his hotel room without anyone noticing?</p>

<p>6 How did someone with “no military background” and that wasn’t a “gun guy at all” operate such advanced weapons? Because what we are being told by the mainstream media just doesn’t make any sense whatsoever. I really like how Natural News made this point…
Far from what the firearms-illiterate media claims, these are not systems that any Joe off the street can just pick up and use to effortlessly mow down 500 people. Running these systems requires extensive training, experience and stamina. It is physically impossible for a guy like Stephen Paddock to operate such a system in the sustained, effective manner that we witnessed, especially when shooting from an elevated position which throws off all the ranging of the weapon system.
Far from being a Navy Seal, Stephen Paddock is a retired accountant senior citizen with a gambling problem and a flabby physique. The only way he could have carried out this shooting is if he were transformed into a human superweapon through a magic wand. I’m calling this “Mission IMPOSSIBLE” because of the physical impossibility of a retired, untrained senior citizen pulling this off. </p>

<p>7 Why was one woman telling people in the crowd that they were all going to die 45 minutes before the attack?</p>

<p>8 Why did it take law enforcement authorities 72 minutes to get into Stephen Paddock’s hotel room?</p>

<p>9 Why did Paddock wire $100,000 to the Philippines last week?</p>

<p>10 Why was Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, in the Philippines when the attack took place? Did she know what was about to happen?</p>

<p>11 Was Paddock on antidepressants like so many other mass killers in the past have been?</p>

<p>12 Why was ISIS so eager to take responsibility for this attack, and why was the FBI so quick to dismiss that connection?</p>

<p>13 Apparently Paddock had earned millions of dollars “through real estate deals”. If he was so wealthy, why would he all of a sudden snap like that?</p>

<p>14 Why did he move so frequently? It is being reported that Paddock had 27 different residences during his adult life.</p>

<p>15 Why were nearly all of the exits out of the concert venue completely blocked?…
In essence, the concert trapped the people, preventing them from escaping, and denying them the ability to seek cover. From there, sustained, full-auto gunfire is almost impossible to survive.
From Fox News, a caller named Russell Bleck, who survived the shooting, said live on air, “There were ten-foot walls blocking us in. We couldn’t escape. It was just a massacre. We had nowhere to go.” </p>

<p>16 Why was a country music festival chosen as the target? Was the goal to kill as many Trump supporters and other conservatives as possible? And is there evidence that Stephen Paddock was connected to Antifa in any way?</p>

<p>So, it does appear to be a note.  It&#39;s been only a few days.  LEO (as much as I may despise them in general) have <em>legitamet</em> procedures to follow.  Evaluating the note (if it is a note) may take some time -- for any number of reasons:  intra-state coordination of additional suspects, or who knows what.  My point is, let&#39;s wait a bit and see what happens.  Two weeks from now if the &quot;note&quot; contents aren&#39;t public THEN let&#39;s raise a stink to have the note released BUT NOT to claim conspiracy.</p>

<p>2 Were there additional shooters? A taxi driver reportedly captured video of an automatic weapon being fired out of a lower level window. A video from another angle and brief footage captured by Dan Bilzerian also seem to confirm that automatic gunfire was coming from a floor much lower than the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock was located on. And if you weren’t convinced by the first three videos, this fourth video should definitely do it.</p>

<p>Those additional shots from the 4th floor etc were categorically shown to be NOT gun shots.</p>

<p>Anything from Bilzerian is suspect.  He&#39;s a known blowhard saying and doing whatever earns him money and attention.  Not to mention he&#39;s a coward who confabulated a story after the fact to cover up his cowardice.</p>

<p>3 Why were law enforcement authorities discussing “another suspect on the fourth floor”, and why isn’t the mainstream media talking about this?</p>

<p>In the confusion of the moment?  Having &quot;first responders&quot; talking with each other about possible other actions?  This is a conspiracy?  It&#39;s called heat of the moment.  I get it that once in a while indicates something different than the conventional narrative, but in the case of responding <strong>in the X</strong>, it&#39;s not a surprise and really normal.  Go watch youtube videos of soldiers in combat:  you&#39;ll routinely hear conflicting accounts of where the attack is coming from, or others involved.</p>

<p>4 As Jon Rappoport has pointed out, it would have been impossible for Stephen Paddock to kill and wound 573 people in less than five minutes of shooting with the kinds of weapons that he is alleged to have used. So why won’t law enforcement authorities acknowledge this fact?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who Rappoport is, so won&#39;t say anything about his claim for now.  Maybe this evening I&#39;ll take him to ground.  However, let&#39;s look at the situation and see how the shooter was able to inflict so many injuries.</p>

<p>His hotel room was located on the 32nd floor.  Roughly three hundred feet in the air.  The targets were in a concert space was roughly XXX feet away.  As many witnesses report, the shooter would open fire at groups of people as they ran for cover.  So, he wasn&#39;t aiming at <em>individuals</em> he was aiming at groups of people moving together.  This makes the &quot;target area&quot; much larger.  The angle he was shooting at increases this target area --- hence the truism in combat that elevation is a winning factor.  Shooting DOWN at people, particularly at and angle, increases the chance of hitting something.  We see the direct result of this:  50+ were killed, 500+ were wounded.  He wasn&#39;t aiming for center-of-mass, he was spray-and-praying at large groups.</p>

<p>The types of weapons etc aren&#39;t really relevant.  Yes, some were low caliber and not able to inflict a kill-shot however ... again .. look at the numbers of dead vs wounded.  I suspect if the shooter was really a competent marksman he would have carried one large caliber rifle with a scope and silencer.  He could have shot for hours before being detected while making highly accurate kill-shots.</p>

<p>5 How in the world did Paddock get 42 guns and “several thousand rounds of ammo” into his hotel room without anyone noticing?</p>

<p>Um, not sure if you ever seen one of these things before:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HSA/pages/default?pageId=23EC2C59-B243-4FBF-A4A6-DD30B92BECD3">https://www.amazon.com/HSA/pages/default?pageId=23EC2C59-B243-4FBF-A4A6-DD30B92BECD3</a></p>

<p>they&#39;re quite handy.  The bellhop even brings them out to your car and puts all your bags in.</p>

<p>He was staying in a fancy hotel, in a large room, for several days, as a high-stakes gambler ... let&#39;s say he had ten bags.  hardly a note.</p>

<p>6 How did someone with “no military background” and that wasn’t a “gun guy at all” operate such advanced weapons? Because what we are being told by the mainstream media just doesn’t make any sense whatsoever. I really like how Natural News made this point… Far from what the firearms-illiterate media claims, these are not systems that any Joe off the street can just pick up and use to effortlessly mow down 500 people. Running these systems requires extensive training, experience and stamina. It is physically impossible for a guy like Stephen Paddock to operate such a system in the sustained, effective manner that we witnessed, especially when shooting from an elevated position which throws off all the ranging of the weapon system. Far from being a Navy Seal, Stephen Paddock is a retired accountant senior citizen with a gambling problem and a flabby physique. The only way he could have carried out this shooting is if he were transformed into a human superweapon through a magic wand. I’m calling this “Mission IMPOSSIBLE” because of the physical impossibility of a retired, untrained senior citizen pulling this off.</p>

<p>Okay, so, I&#39;m not going to argue the ability of a casual to operate these sorts of weapons, but let&#39;s consider what it involves to operate:</p>

<ul>
<li>load magazine.</li>
<li>insert magazine.  Maybe this is trick?  the rectangle metal object goes into the rectangular opening.  Push firmly, for a click sound.</li>
<li>find switch labeled &quot;safety&quot; and switch to &quot;semi-&quot;.  Sometimes they&#39;re hard to find, but every rifle I&#39;ve ever dealt with only has one button and one slider switch.  Shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find via trial and error.</li>
<li>point in direction of intended affect</li>
<li>pull trigger until no more BANG sounds.</li>
<li>push the other button to release magazine.</li>
<li>insert freshly loaded magazine.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, it&#39;s not a complicated process.  Also, this guy was not &quot;a gun newb&quot; ... he had been shooting before - that I recall hearing about in the News was with his brother/kids skeet shooting.  So, he was NOT a gun newb.</p>

<p>7 Why was one woman telling people in the crowd that they were all going to die 45 minutes before the attack?</p>

<p>Because Vegas and other crazy people are everywhere.  There is a guy here in my town driving around a pickup with flags and banners proclaiming the world will end in a few months.  BUT IF IT DOES HE&#39;S GOING TO BE HELLA SUPRISED!</p>

<p>8 Why did it take law enforcement authorities 72 minutes to get into Stephen Paddock’s hotel room?</p>

<p>Because, LEO being what it is, and learning tactics from the Military, advance with caution.  Specifically the Military doctrine is 3:1 superiority.</p>

<p>They wanted to ensure they did things correctly to presevere legal prosecution ability.</p>

<p>Because SWAT doesn&#39;t sit around the water cooler in full kit waiting for a call.  It takes time for them to get a call, get dress, transport their ass, and then coordinate.</p>

<p>9 Why did Paddock wire $100,000 to the Philippines last week?</p>

<p>Because he had a girlfriend. </p>

<p>10 Why was Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, in the Philippines when the attack took place? Did she know what was about to happen?</p>

<p>Who knows.  Let&#39;s talk with her.  Oh, the FBI is doing that.</p>

<p>11 Was Paddock on antidepressants like so many other mass killers in the past have been?</p>

<p>Good guestion.  Let&#39;s find out.    Maybe you&#39;ll be onto a much more real conspiracy:  namely that cancer meds&#39; are uniformly un-helpful and yet are super expensive.</p>

<p>12 Why was ISIS so eager to take responsibility for this attack, and why was the FBI so quick to dismiss that connection?</p>

<p>Because ISIS ALWAYS claims shit.  It&#39;s a PR thing.   It means nothing.  Now, if they made the claim BEFORE, that would be something.</p>

<p>13 Apparently Paddock had earned millions of dollars “through real estate deals”. If he was so wealthy, why would he all of a sudden snap like that?</p>

<p>So, &quot;wealth&quot; means &quot;mental health&quot; ??  Have you ever watched John McCaffee in videos?  </p>

<p>14 Why did he move so frequently? It is being reported that Paddock had 27 different residences during his adult life.</p>

<p>Because he&#39;s wealthy and can.  I move every couple years and I have a shit job and a family.</p>

<p>15 Why were nearly all of the exits out of the concert venue completely blocked?… In essence, the concert trapped the people, preventing them from escaping, and denying them the ability to seek cover. From there, sustained, full-auto gunfire is almost impossible to survive. From Fox News, a caller named Russell Bleck, who survived the shooting, said live on air, “There were ten-foot walls blocking us in. We couldn’t escape. It was just a massacre. We had nowhere to go.”</p>

<p>Blocked exits?  No.  People jumping walls/fences?  TO GET THE FUCK OUT.  (as that Blizerian clown did).</p>

<p>16 Why was a country music festival chosen as the target? Was the goal to kill as many Trump supporters and other conservatives as possible? And is there evidence that Stephen Paddock was connected to Antifa in any way?</p>

<p>Because it was an easy target, he didn&#39;t like the singer, who knows.  He made hotel arrangements the week before for Lolapallooza.  If he had decided to open fire then,  you&#39;d be shouting that it was Fascists or somesuch.  The point is he didn&#39;t care about WHO he shot up, only that it was A LOT.</p>
