There is no constructive debating going on it’s just name calling and tearing down people who are trying to understand what happened. If you think the theory on the shooting that it was ISIS related and the shooter was an undercover FBI agent is “ridiculous” then give your own theory on what is going on. Just going for ad hominem attacks on the OP makes you look dumb. No one knows what happened or why, quit acting as though you do know because you don’t, none of us do. That is why we should have constructive debates giving information and evidence and our own theories as to why some guy shot at and killed people.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a reasonable statement. But sorry, it&#39;s still possible there were two shooters.</p>

<p>Maybe there were 2 shooters in the hotel room, who killed Paddock and then fled. If the cops showed us the footage from the room, we&#39;d know Paddock pulled the triggers, but according to them none were recording...</p>

<p>I would also like to add that Stephen Paddock <em>could</em> have had a trained Koala sidekick that was feeding him ammo and cold weapons to fire, he scaled up the building as the cops broke in after looking back at his best friend and life partner Stephen lying on the ground in a pool of his own blood, never to be seen again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even under these circumstances you shouldn&#39;t use name calling.  Why?  Because there actually <em>have</em> been enough events that do in fact use crisis actors with wholly staged scenarios.  It&#39;s no big surprise that some people get confused and think that many of these events are staged.  Some in fact <em>are</em> staged.</p>

<p>This one seems to be pretty real and non-staged.  However, even within the context of real events, TPTB can and will manipulate the narrative by lying and placing certain people in certain locations during interviews, etc.</p>

<p>Events can be entirely real, or entirely faked, or a mix of both so that there are some elements that are real, and others that are staged within any single event.</p>

<p>It seems real people got shot and killed here, and for anyone calling this a staged event, I would simply say that A) it seems <em>real</em> people did get shot here, and B) some events can have both staged and real scenarios.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just one thing.</p>

<p>We have shills of course, and if a shills larger purpose is to disrupt they may participate even if the shooting doesn&#39;t directly further their goals.</p>

<p>We have trolls, trolls just love to stir shit up. From previously banned users, to people who like to make fun of this sub, to people with nothing better to do.</p>

<p>We have people who are overly passionate about things. Whether it&#39;s that their theory is correct or other people are wrong.</p>

<p>We have people genuinely trying to contribute who get frustrated by all of this and then begin to feed into it themselves. Pretty sure this will happen to almost anyone who regularly comments here and gets in arguments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the issue is that a certain segment of the conspiracy community has been coopted by neocon talking points and have taken up the left/ right dichotomy that they previously rallied against.  </p>

<p>This &quot;alt-right&quot; conspiracy group group would like to attribute the event to ISIS or ANTIFA, as per their narrative.  Much like &quot;the left&quot; would like to attribute it to the accessibility of guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but at this point we have one dead shooter, no windows blown out other than the suite he was in, and no videos with overlapping gun fire.</p>

<p>The idea there were multiple shooters only plausibly held water until about dawn on Monday. We have to ask for concrete evidence at this point. </p>
