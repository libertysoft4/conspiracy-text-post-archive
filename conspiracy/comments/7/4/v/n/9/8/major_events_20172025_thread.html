<p>Elon stays out of the governmental spotlight but is one of very few billionaires today that is widely adored enough to be backed across the board. In order for Musk to be a candidate reforms would have needed to have been made to the presidency to allow non-native Americans to run. Not a stretch with the current contempt for the system. </p>

<p>A NWO is now being openly discussed in central Western media but as a thing that is preferential but not happening. Deflection.

<li><p><strong>A new religion unites all, but is satanic. It will assert that we are descended from God&#39;s and rationalise terrible things. Potentially Luciferianism. People will buy into it because it will seemingly come from an ancient civilisation found under the ice in Antarctica. The civilisation was of the Annunaki and will bring a new perspective on the Bible, Quran and Torah as well as explaining human history much clearer (explains pyramids, Baalbek etc). The Nazi symbol originates from this civilisation. Sacrifices will become normal and death penalty will be seen as the preferred option. 2019&gt;.</strong></p></li>

<li><strong>Banks are centrally owned by the government as well as all public owned businesses.

<p>The aim of this thread isn&#39;t to breed fear, it&#39;s to nurture critical thought. At this point it&#39;s almost certain something is up with the world. If you think I&#39;m wrong on any of these points I challenge you to search for yourself and bring new theories and evidence to the table. After all why else would you be on a conspiracy sub?</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t like that you hardly put any positive predictions in there. IMHO this kind of thinking plays into the hands of the so-called elites by keeping us in a fearful state.</p>

<p>For example, what about &quot;Tesla&#39;s (or someone else&#39;s) free energy tech gets disclosed&quot;? It wouldn&#39;t be that far off.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I tried to keep emotion out of it but I must admit the forecast for the next 7 years, as I see it, is going to be largely traumatic. We don&#39;t emphasize Hitler on what he did to improve the German economy for example. That said I leave the predictions at 2025 for a reason. That is around the time I think the next real revolution of culture will take place with the eventual toppling of the NWO.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t put any links against the point about quality of life vastly improving because that&#39;s a little harder to evidence until it happens but my thoughts there are that as part of this we will see huge technological leaps in medicine/life extension, travel, energy production etc that will outlast the NWO. </p>

<p>There&#39;s many theories on what technology that included but I believe that he had found a way to harness energy directly from the atmosphere (solar radiation trapped, think lightning storms) and transmit it wirelessly. I go into more detail here </p>

<p>There are also stories about anti-gravity (perhaps this is why there are so many reports of flying saucers)

<p>Add to this that it&#39;s typical for the military (especially the American military) to be decades ahead in terms of technology, if there is a war I believe the following years we will see a domination of automation and AI in manufacturing to the point where most people would not have to work in the classical sense, giving people more time to indulge in hobbies and interests.</p>
