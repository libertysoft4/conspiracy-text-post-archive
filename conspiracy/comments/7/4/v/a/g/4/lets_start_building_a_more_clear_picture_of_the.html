I think personal accounts of the event from people who were actually there really helps build a more clear picture of what happened that night. </p>

<p>Now I do admit maybe some of these people were scared and were maybe confused from the concert shooting but there definitely seems more to it as the inconsistencies continue to add up.</p>

<p>Below is my compilation of a multiple shooter theory reports from across social media. Please contribute yours if you have any. I&#39;ve decided to censor the people&#39;s names for privacy reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even sure what is the best one.  Just that one should be made that is credible and genuine for legitimate investigation and documentation.  The reddit platform could provide that if no where else.  Similar to the Boston Bombing subreddit and Pizzagate subredit, but we know what happened to those, so its a difficult task, but worthwhile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The multiple shooter theory is being promulgated by the event&#39;s own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anXdfUUDfzI">crisis actors</a> and is increasingly obviously a facet of this psy-op to confuse and distract from the fact that there&#39;s no reason anyone should be convinced that real shots were even fired at anything, let alone anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can take that as a theory. But first let&#39;s get all of the reports and then we will be able to make a better educated conclusion. </p>

<p>I mean if we have only a few reports of such then your theory could actually hold some serious weight. However if we discover that more than half of the people that were there are reporting the same thing then we might be on to something. Nothing is stopping us from looking into this with an open mind yet skeptical mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, so before speculating about how many shooters and who they were, it must first be established that shots were really fired, and should be incredibly easy to do were this a real shooting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you can&#39;t prove shots were fired, or that there are dead people, but you know that there were shots fired because there were dead people. </p>

<p>Yeah there&#39;s something missing: realism. What we have are early reports of the shooting, ads for crisis actors, people in the crowd saying there are fake gunshots, confirmed crisis acting, and the complete and total absence of <em>anything</em> to demonstrate that anything was shot, at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m open to believing shots were fired, at any time or place, and I do agree that in one of the videos the &quot;gunfire&quot; seems to be coming from at least two different locations, but in my opinion there is not nearly the visual evidence that any shots were fired and hit anything that there would be in abundance if any real shooting actually occurred.</p>

<p>For this reason, and because there is obviously crisis acting and fakery going on, I&#39;m inclined to believe it was all a drill or hoax type scenario but would be open to considering any evidence anyone wants to offer of real shooting taking place. Again, if it were a real shooting on this scale, by now there would be a truckload of things to show someone who doubted this that would prove it beyond reasonable doubt. </p>

The only thing that gave me doubt was the fact I know nothing about how acoustics and echoes work on th LV strip... basically a giant concert hallway. That video was taken from the taxi line at Mandalay so it was a little sketch on audio... The body cam was 10 minutes uninterrupted video outside of the event and thus In a more open air setting... In that video it definitely sounds like a bump stock ar15 with intervals for reloading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dots are all there, just need the final pieces</p>

<p>MGM Resorts has ties to companies from the Middle East (Dubai) that are owners of ports known to smuggle illegal weapons and terrorists</p>

<p>Stephen Paddock is an accounting wizard that worked for the IRS&#39;s defense auditing team, an then was hired to work for the defense company(ies) himself, first on the books at Lockheed Martin</p>

<p>Paddock gets introduced through those defense and government entities to gun runners who sell American guns to nefarious groups around the world, and starts working with them.</p>

<p>What better place to launder money than through a casino on a machine that pays 99.7% which turns a bling eye to said gun running and laundering all with the wink wink of the US govt</p>

<p>Somewhere in this scheme, this go-between and launderer get pissy at the US govt, and gets radicalized.  Either that, or coerced with threats of force towards his family.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have psychotic breaks, it happens to people of all ages for all sorts of reasons. I know a guy who lost his mind after his cat died at 60, he was super accomplished, had just been promoted, was nationally recognized, a fucking genius academic who was recognized as leader in his field internationally, but he destroyed his life, career, and marraige in a matter of months, started acting sociopathic and threatening people, got arrested multiple times and  has pushed every person who ever cared for him away forever, all becuase his fucking cat died. It&#39;s absurd for you to rule out serious mental illness in this situation like it&#39;s impossible. Like with most of these shooter conspiracies people are trying to find  some kind of logical plan, some kind of rational motive, some kind of reason why this happened,  instead of facing just how scary and chaotic the world actually is and that  these things can just happen out of nowhere when someone starts getting the wrong thoughts stirring around in their head.</p>

<p>Regardless of what position you take on the subject of the war, the American supported players in ME get their weapons and training hand delivered and simply looking over a SCW/MENA small arms Twitter account shows how thriving the weapons market is over there. They have all the weapons they need, they don&#39;t need to clandestinely buy them from some white dude in a hotel (probably the worst place to a covert Arms deal)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, that makes sense! The problem is ISIS isn&#39;t capitalizing on that - they&#39;re claiming he was their operative.</p>

<p>I know how their PR works and it would be a lot better if they claimed that their fighters had killed (and subsequently exposed) an FBI agent attempting to work with a Terrorist org and had then carried out their mission from that point forward.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t think of a single terrorist organization that wouldn&#39;t expose the FBI/abc in that instance and refuse to take credit for the &#39;bigger picture&#39;. The biggest determining factor of a terrorist organization is their publicity and this is relatively marginalized. </p>

<p>Ive heard this happen a few times though personally. What I think your hearing is rounds breaking the sound barrier. At first you hear the gun itself. Gunpowder in the chamber.</p>

<p>It sounds like a completely different gun because I believe he was strafing. Shooting at a different group, and then started firing in proximity of the camera. When the rounds are actually close the bang you hear usually isnt the actual gun, but the snap of  the rounds breaking the sound barrier. Sometimes you hear both. Usually the deeper sound of the gun, followed by the snap. </p>

<p>We can discuss what we can agree on / disagree on as will fill in the blanks. For instance, there&#39;s gonna be a lot of disagreement about no. of shooters (or whether there was a shooting at all). We are therefore going to need to have mutliple possible scenarios. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just can&#39;t logically follow a multiple shooters theory. For the beginning, just look at the casualties and how they all occurred in the  concert venue. The numbers would be massively inflated if there was more than one guy.</p>

<p>Secondly, if it was some Org, it&#39;s easier to fear that than a single, lone wolf, crazed (although I don&#39;t think he was mentally ill) shooter. If this was some organized movement, attempting to actively disrupt the peace, it&#39;s easier to tell people that and have them fear the next attack. Additionally, it&#39;s easier to legislate that as well (ban guns from Muslim immigrants, monitor communications country wide for extremism) etc. One lone wold guy is exactly that, nothing to fear, no agenda to push with.</p>

<p>In this day and age, there would be so much footage of the other shoots, and there&#39;s none. Just people reacting to what&#39;s going on outside and hoaxes/accidental misinfo. No one has footage of anyone injured in another hotel, or images of a shooter in the other hotels, but they sure have video of people running around and screaming, which makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nah man, our super competent government set a scene with 5 or more shooters and managed to clean up all their blood without having to set up a crime scene where those 5 shooters were and get their bodies out of there with no one around them witnessing it and taking pictures. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, I know our government is fucked up and does fucked up shit - but its 2017 and there&#39;s cameras and video on everyone&#39;s phone yet not a single picture or video of any of these extra shooters? c&#39;mon guys get real. and every video that is evidence is just people running, BECAUSE THEY HEARD THERE WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER ON THE STRIP</p>

<p>This is my biggest gripe with NWO organizations. If you&#39;ve ever been a part of, or seen first hand, how hard it is to run any organization with a board. Humans are retarded. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a town hall meeting or a local project go smoothly, mostly because of the incompetency of the local representatives.</p>

<p>To think that a select group of people are doing this on some massive, global scale and the only reason people are on to them is because there was an eyeball with a pyramid in an episode of Spongebob is comical.</p>

<p>I know your comment was facetious but I&#39;m speaking in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>first hand accounts are super bad.  tons of ppl hearing echos thinking its a 2nd shooter.  tons of people who know nothing about guns all of a sudden are world class experts.  initial media reports, esp based on witness testimony, will be incorrect.</p>

<p>youre going to end up with a shit storm of bad data</p>

<p>then youre going to try and make a theory out of bad data</p>

Can you imagine a hospital calling in extra staff to handle the anticipated influx of patients only to find an empty ER ? All the first responders, EMTs, paramedics, sitting idle with empty ambulances. You don&#39;t think any of the thousands of people involved would be like wtf? Where are all the injured? Thousands of people donating blood. Are they just tossing it in the trash?</p>
