The cruise was one of 12 Stephen Paddock went on in the past year as police source confirms they are studying the trips for clues about his motive</p>

<p>Las Vegas Shooter Made ISIS Tape According To Former Trump Campaign Official</p>

<p><a href="http://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/2017/10/06/las-vegas-shooter-made-isis-tape-according-to-former-trump-campaign-official/#sthash.OxyfXTNu.dpbs">http://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/2017/10/06/las-vegas-shooter-made-isis-tape-according-to-former-trump-campaign-official/#sthash.OxyfXTNu.dpbs</a></p>

<p>There is a video, this video will prove the motive. He had a secret digital profile that was uncovered over the last 24 hrs. </p>

<p>Motive will be pretty shocking, I won&#39;t say much but it will definitely change a lot of things going forward.

<p>If he wasn&#39;t religious...why was he visiting mosques? </p>

<p>Also being told Paddock visited some prominent mosques over in UAE and Jordan. Why have these details not been shared?</p>

<p>So I assume the FBI and Deep State knows exactly what he did over in Jordan and UAE...unless they totally turned a blind eye like usual.</p>

<p><strong>I think the ISIS connection proves that&#39;s it&#39;s another deep state false flag</strong></p>

<p>“Most terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We’ve become a lunatic asylum.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I find it confusing as well. In the beginning ISIS claimed it and it was quickly swept under the rug. I&#39;m not sure Why that is? Maybe if the reason for the operation was to push gun control and more surveillance the ISIS connection could have brought up the travel ban being &quot;more needed&quot; then gun control. If that makes sense? I can only theorize. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The theories I&#39;ve been seeing are that there is a power struggle between Feds and local police - and they immediately planned to pin this all on Paddock and had his ISIS ties lined up but we&#39;re quickly shown that this whole thing might unravel so they&#39;re doing whatever they can to back off their manufactured narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best way to handle a real terrorist attack (i.e. not false flag) is TO NOT publicize who did or to make it seem less collateral than it actually is. If the government publicized isis as being responsible it means the war on terror, patriot act, naked body scanners were pretty much for nothing. Of course this vegas attack is a great way to come after the 2nd amendment, so they blame a random white guy.</p>
