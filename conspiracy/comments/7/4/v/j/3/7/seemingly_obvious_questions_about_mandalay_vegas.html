<li><p>Wouldn&#39;t guests above/below/next to the shooter hear the windows breaking and rounds being shot? I know there was a report of someone below him but what about the people on his floor? And wouldn&#39;t that happen almost immediately, giving him next to no time to shoot?</p></li>
<li><p>If that was the case, he should have expected limited time to fire. So why bring ALL of those guns/ammo? Seems like a waste if he knew he only had 10-20 minutes of shooting.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, the fact that he DID bring so much equipment with him suggests that he was initially prepared to shoot for a much longer time and hurt a lot more people, so why would he execute his plan so poorly?</p></li>
<li><p>How does a 64 year old male even have the stamina/strength to break two full sized windows and then continue to shoot up a crowd...could his lack of energy explain the gaps in the shootings?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A usual goal with a mass shooting/attack is to hurt the largest amount of people in the most efficient way and it seems like there were a lot of other methods he could have employed in order to harm a larger amount of people...as fucked up as it is, I&#39;m just surprised that the body count is so low.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been so intrigued by this all week, can&#39;t stop reading or watching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I was LOUD. Like, there was no doubt about what had happened. We heard a loud bang, and a girl dropped. Everyone started running and screaming.</p>

<p>Maybe it makes sense that the music drowned it out on the top few floors, but the people on the same floor and probably the floors at least immediately above and below should have been able to hear it. If the gun fire was able to be heard streets away why couldn’t the people in the hotel hear it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A school shooting (for which I give my condolences you experienced) is <em>much</em> different than a Las Vegas hotel/concert/event shooting. The venue being Las Vegas to begin with brings a lot of things guests expect-- drunken guests (possible crashing bottles/glasses), loud parties, bachelor/bachelorette parties with screaming and laughing. Secondly, as someone mentioned the guests at that time would likely be out of their rooms. Most ppl don&#39;t visit Vegas to stay in their rooms. A concert was going on outside. Only natural to assume there&#39;d be fireworks. To the untrained hear (like many of the victims below) gunshots are confused with fireworks. This was, afterall, the end of the festival. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive been saying from the beginning that the security guard stood out to me right away. People are hailing him a hero. Usually media would be all over that kinda story for ratings. The man who saw the shooter and survived! Look at the Boston Bombing &quot;hero&quot;. He was interviewed almost immediately and, iirc, even sat with the President one on one. I really think Compos was part of the plot and used his uniform as a way out without being noticed or questioned. Especially if he was shot in the leg. No one would think to question him leaving the scene injured. He could have easilly have double crossed Paddock to be used as a patsy and it would explain the 2 broken windows if he was involved. I dont even know what he looks like, which to me, is crazy considering we have pictures of the victims and other stories of men shielding their gf/wives from bullets. What do we know about Jesus Campos?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but he supposedly set up a sniper nest inside the hotel room. No rifle extended beyond the window. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever shot a lot of rifle or pistol, in an indoor range, there is a significant amount of smoke and gas. How the fuck could he see in an unventilated hotel room after fire hundreds, or thousands of rounds? </p>

<p>The hotel photos also show few casings around the room. If he was shooting, brass usually elects in one direction, fast and hard. It usually takes chunks out of wood on shooting bays. I didn&#39;t see any brass, damage or the like anywhere in those photos. If it was a true investigation, wouldn&#39;t they not be allowed to touch anything in the room before that investigation is complete?</p>

<p>Most ARs are ambidextrous, allowing you to change the configuration based on whether you are right or left handed. I guess I would just figure there would be a shit ton of brass in that hotel room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>absolutely incorrect. ARs are not ambidextrous.  the ejection port and forward assist, if there is one, are on the side opposite the mag release, bolt catch - they are forged this way. you CAN get ambidextrous parts like your CH, bolt/mag release, etc, but the brass is still only ejecting in one direction based on how the upper receiver was designed.  left handed ARs have the ejection port on the left side, and right handed on the right. you cant change this on the fly.  there&#39;s no argument there. seems like a simple mistake for someone with any experience with the AR platform...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just playing devils advocate so keep ya pitch forks down for now:</p>

<p>1: I don&#39;t think it would be as &#39;obvious&#39; as you think. Yes, other guests would hear it - definitely. But would they actually be able to figure out which direction it is coming from? There is a lot of sound proofing in these hotels and the majority of the sound would be going strait outward away from the hotel. So while other people could hear it, they probably wouldn&#39;t know anything more than &#39;its coming from above/below/left/right&#39;.. but not how far in that direction(if that, at all).</p>

<p>2: He may have thought he would get through more shooting - a lot of people, whether its going hiking or having some drinks with friends will bring <em>more</em> than they think they would need because they are going to be in a situation where they can&#39;t <em>get</em> more if they did need it. Being over-prepared isn&#39;t exactly uncommon for.. anything really.</p>

<p>3: Maybe the panic/adrenaline was making it difficult to complete his agenda. We don&#39;t know the full details of his &#39;counter measures&#39;, but potentially he thought that whatever he did(that we don&#39;t yet know about) was going to slow down police response more than it ended up doing.</p>

<p>4: Meth. Cocaine. Drugs of whatever stimulant variation - this is Vegas after all. A heavy hit of stimulants allows people to do all sorts of great physical accomplishments they normally couldn&#39;t do and 64 isn&#39;t <em>that</em> old. Yes it is tiring firing off guns but it isn&#39;t <em>that</em> tiring either. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that much of a stretch to think someone of 64 and average stamina/fitness could pull this off without drugs, but they certainly would make it easier.</p>

<p>The gaps are far more likely to be reload/setting up time. </p>

<p>The body count isn&#39;t that low either. People have an unrealistic view of how lethal getting shot really is. A single bullet from a significant distance has to hit a very vital organ/area of the body to actually kill anyone if they don&#39;t receive medical treatment quickly. Most people would have only been shot once I would imagine, due to the inaccuracy of the methods employed(distance/rate of fire etc).</p>

<p>He did manage to hit 500+ people which is still a &#39;pretty good effort&#39;(feels fucked up saying that) for the distance and time he was shooting - it works out to be over 50 people per minute - close to <strong>hitting someone every second he fired, on average</strong>. That isn&#39;t &#39;poor efficiency&#39; by any means, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes, I didn&#39;t factor in the trampling/panic casualties. But even still, being &#39;generous&#39;(err?) lets say <em>half</em> were from his bullets. One casualty every 2 seconds? Still pretty efficient. </p>

<p>I am still unsure of everything except that lots of stuff doesn&#39;t add up in this shooting and it is getting stranger by the day. For sure this was not what we are being told, but what exactly that is.. we need more information, you are right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Depending on the construction methods of the hotel, there could be a lot of poured concrete between his room and other rooms which would significantly dampen the sound.  I&#39;m also guessing he was firing very close to the window to be able to shoot down and across the street.  This would tend to make most of the firing noise go out the window, not reverberate in the room.</p>

<p>2 &amp; 3) The catharsis of actually executing some of his plan proved more emotionally overwhelming than expected, and he lost interest in continuing to fire.  It&#39;s the post-Christmas-presents letdown.  You have all this build up over what gifts you&#39;ll get and how bad you want them, and then when you finally have them, it&#39;s like meh and you&#39;ve totally forgotten why you were so excited.</p>

<p>Bottom line is he was overly optimistic as to what he could accomplish.  And how bad would it suck if you thought ahead of time &quot;I can only get off 1 magazine before they capture me&quot; and then it turns out you aren&#39;t discovered for 8 hours, but you didn&#39;t bring enough guns and ammo.  It&#39;s a once in a lifetime chance, so pack appropriately.  It sounds silly, but I&#39;d imagine he figured he would have more time, would WANT to shoot more, and had a more heroic vision of a protracted shoot-out with the cops, too.</p>

<p>The actual reality is shooting into the crowd a couple of times and seeing the reaction gave him an emotional response he wasn&#39;t expecting and probably a too-quick discovery.  IIRC, he blasted at the door and wounded a security guard.  I&#39;m assuming his emotional state plus &quot;the jig is up&quot; realization and then he just punched his own ticket to avoid capture.</p>

<p>4) I don&#39;t think breaking the windows was that hard.   I think had some kind of window breaking gizmo that made it easier.  The gunfire wouldn&#39;t really have been stressful physically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I can tell you before the first shot there was noises against the windows below. As I sat there watching tv it sounded like something just scraped down my window which I just thought that&#39;s weird.. then a few moments later the first of the firing. Come morning and day light I then noticed the glass from his window on the roof below, which very likely could have been what the initial sound was. It&#39;s not like people are expecting certain things from a sound or know instantly what it was to be able to alert anyone about anything credible. Some of these theories are just a huge reach, everyone over analyzing everything. The guy thought this threw, probably had a high iQ, what he did really shouldn&#39;t be considered impossible by any means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not been shown on mainstream media yet but there are logs showing the he was actually in the hotel from the 25th of September, but was put in to another room until the suite on the 32nd floor became available. So if he had the guns from the 25th of September he would of had to move the guns and ammo in to a different room too. </p>

<p>I have also seen an article saying that most of these hotels (and I imagine especially Manderlay Bay as it&#39;s part of MGM) have bullet proof windows or at the very least the windows are alarmed when they are tampered with. I imagine this is so that people who have lost big amounts of money can&#39;t jump from the window. Surely by now we would have more witness reports, people seeing him around the hotel/strip/casinos.</p>

Like supplies or equipment he&#39;d use after.  Maybe there was a go bag by the door.  maybe maps of local areas, maybe staged equipment at another location for him to hide out at.  I don&#39;t think they found sheets tied together to repel down the building.  </p>

<li>If it really were a mass shooting with hundreds of casualties that took place in front of thousands of witnesses hundreds of whom were already using their recording devices, in one of the most highly video surveilled cities in the world, wouldn&#39;t there be actual proof or at least evidence that demonstrates anything having been shot x 100 by now?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I guess anyone can say anything anonymously on here but I did know someone who died there. False flag conspiracies kind of get to me because it’s hard on the people who lost people during them. I don’t think they work either.

    <div class="md"><p>1) idk. I also saw someone say that no one was in their room at 10 pm cause Vegas; however, that contradicts a news report I saw saying that one of the performers infant sons and his nanny were in the room next to the shooter. I don’t have the source readily available, so if anyone does, much appreciated. </p>

<p>2) Boy Scout motto, “always be prepared”. Idk if that’s correct, but there are sources saying he wanted to escape. </p>

<p>3) I honestly think this is the easiest one. We know he was a regular at these casinos. I don’t know if he was a regular at this particular one, but he often had long hotel stays. I’m sure he put all of his kit in bags and put those on the luggage rack. I don’t think it would rly raise any eyebrows. </p>

<p>I figure you can get all of your pistols in one suitcase, probably the ammo too. Idk about the rifles though, I don’t own any. I suppose you’d have to have a big suitcase for those. </p>

<p>I just don’t think it would be incredibly strange for this guy to come in with 10 bags when he is known to move around so frequently, and stay in these hotels. Do we have any details about his stay there? I guess I can look and update this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems the police were at his door 16 minutes after the first call came in. The Security guard was at his door 10-12 minutes from the first shots fired.</p>

<p>With the adrenaline, he had tunnel vision. Once he was distracted from shooting out the window by the security guard, he diverted his tunnel vision to the hallway. </p>

<p>I think, if he really was a lone gunman, I think he fired towards the hallway, knew he was caught and ended his life right then and there. </p>

<p>It took the cops 60+ minutes before they breached, but that doesn&#39;t mean they weren&#39;t breathing down his neck much sooner. I think the timeline from the police communication was that they were clearing the 31st and 32nd floor within 16 minutes of the first call, give or take. That sounds about right for when he stopped firing out the window.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t the smoke alarm go off?  Anyone that has been to an indoor range knows there&#39;s a lot of smoke. I think he/they panicked as this wasn&#39;t planned for.  No way he shot himself in chest at point blank range and then was able to shoot himself in the head.  Not sure if police pumped one in his chest but that&#39;s possible too.  </p>

<p>When you plan something for as long as he/they did and overlook the smoke alarm going off probably a minute into it, then continue for another 10, you know the heat is coming as the smoke alarms pinpoint the source to hotel command and control.  A smoke alarm siren is a sound that will induce additional stress to an already stressful situation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A school shooting (for which I give my condolences you experienced) is <em>much</em> different than a Las Vegas hotel/concert/event shooting. The venue being Las Vegas to begin with brings a lot of things guests expect-- drunken guests (possible crashing bottles/glasses), loud parties, bachelor/bachelorette parties with screaming and laughing. Secondly, as someone mentioned the guests at that time would likely be out of their rooms. Most ppl don&#39;t visit Vegas to stay in their rooms. A concert was going on outside. Only natural to assume there&#39;d be fireworks. To the untrained hear (like many of the victims below) gunshots are confused with fireworks. This was, afterall, the end of the festival. </p>
