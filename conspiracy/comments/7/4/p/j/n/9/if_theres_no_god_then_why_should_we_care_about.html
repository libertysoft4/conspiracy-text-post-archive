    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you are being preachy. I can talk about this subject with you, but it&#39;s true that I won&#39;t discuss most subjects with people who use faith as a source of knowledge. This is because faith based reasoning in unassailable. </p>

<p>The Socratic method involves questioning why you believe something to be true until you get to the bottom of your beliefs. Its a recursive process. Theists often say they believe something because it is part of their faith.  This means there is no underlying beliefs to explore deeper than that faith and since I don&#39;t share the faith we can&#39;t find common ground.</p>

<p>Basically I don&#39;t mind you being a Christian, but I&#39;m not and so I don&#39;t count you as a person I can take seriously anymore than I expect you count me as one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the death penalty is often a punishment that has been decided upon by a jury, and is usually not something conferred on someone by another person.</p>

<p>I feel like sometimes the ardently religious people see the non-religious the same way people and cops see sovereign citizens. The non-religious people often have a strong sense of self, and I feel like being religious requires you to give at least a part of your self to God. You have to be willing to give certain sacrifices and live a certain way under the premise that this is following the plan and rules of God, and that it will be rewarded, but it&#39;s not like God himself came down from heaven and had you sign a contract on ink and paper that said that. It&#39;s called &quot;faith&quot; because you have to be willing to do that, you have to be willing to put yourself and everything you do in the hands of something that you can&#39;t physically <em>show</em> someone who doesn&#39;t believe. </p>

<p>So, back to what you were asking, it&#39;s not that there is something wrong with God punishing sinners <em>assuming he exists</em>. The problem is that I don&#39;t think <em>man</em> should be able to levy punishment against <em>man</em> in the name of God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>right? but fortunately most people don&#39;t like to be hurt either emotionally or physically. so if I don&#39;t like being raped I would say rape sucks and I think rape should be wrong. most would agree. morality is not exclusive to Christianity. I am a Christian but the idea that you should do unto others as you would have them do unto you is basic human nature. we all learn at a fairly young age about sharing and things like that and we learn what makes us happy like when someone does good things for you. you want those things done for you and you learn that you need to do nice things for others in order to maintain that cycle. simple </p>

    <div class="md"><p>then that society would become chaos. law and order would go out the window and you would lose basic functions of civilization like utilities. look at how many civilizations there have been throughout history. there have been countless types of religions and many types of law. the simple truth is you don&#39;t need god to have a civilized society. subjective morality has been working for ages. if you get any random group of people together living in a functioning community law and order will be born or chaos will consume them and they will be annihilated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All morality is subjective, but to you your bible is the dictator on your moral code. You can&#39;t see how it can be morally subjective. The ideas of morals a lone is a subjective subject. People can agree on some basic moral prinicples. But the best way for morals to catch on is if they are often practiced. I believe hypocrisy is what has diminished most peoples faith. So many grand churches that put on a show and speak the word but dont&#39; practice it faithfully. It&#39;s what put me off to even approaching the subject. I believe in a higher power and don&#39;t believe I need to read a book to understand or feel that power.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally don&#39;t think anyone can say there is a god (or call it a &quot;creator&quot;) or not. And if there was, there might not be a &quot;purpose&quot;  and the entity might be completely ambivalent to us and our pursuits. So the whole thing is a bit of a moot point, imo. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>It&#39;s important to have a civil and polite society because that&#39;s how everyone would like to be treated. The world would suck for you if everyone was an asshole, right? That&#39;s why we should strive to be good people. Also - I think this universe is pretty interesting and if we work together maybe someday we can start figuring it all out. Maybe we can eventually solve those questions we think are unanswerable eventually. </p>

Think about movies, no one ever goes into making a movie with the intention to have it be meaningless (what would be the point, right?), directors, actors, everyone involved is striving to create a meaningful movie. Why? Why is creating meaning so important? Is it so we can feel like our time isn&#39;t wasted? And if we  feel like our time could be wasted than it would seem to me that we are saying that life&#39;s a gift and in order to show that we are worthy of such a gift, we make that gift meaningful, so that the gift won&#39;t be wasted on us. </p>

I think that countries with high atheist rates do well caring for others (Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand). I&#39;d also point out that during the most fervent religious periods of history saw the most extreme lack of caring for each other (middle ages, serfdom, Spanish Inquisition, witch trials, Western institutionalized  slavery, etc...). Lastly, it appears that the most religious countries murder the most people today (Islamic religious fundamental states, Israell, America, Baltic states, etc...). How do you reconcile that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to care about other people. That&#39;s up to you. I personally only care about other people who also care about other people.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think most people do care about others. Humans are pretty selfish. They don&#39;t like to feel bad, and so they will do things - like charity - to avoid feeling bad, but if you can convince someone to not feel bad about suffering they will often be satisfied with that. That&#39;s not caring about others that&#39;s caring about themselves.</p>

<p>Why would the existence of God makes you care about other people? Caring can&#39;t be faked, so simply being ordered to by a commandment doesn&#39;t cut it. Caring is a feeling you either have or do not have.</p>

Care about your life because it&#39;s the framework and foundation anything you begin to value is built from.  Make the conscious choice to care about your life because the alternative is valuing nothing.  And that is like taking an equation, multiplying both sides of it by zero, and proclaiming life and death both amounting to nothing.</p>

<p>As for caring about others, that usually comes naturally once you&#39;ve decided that your own life has value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, we have identified at least two groups of people.  </p>

<p>Group 1- Do not believe in god and do not commit horrible acts.  </p>

<p>Group 2- Believe in god and commit horrible acts.  </p>

<p>I assume you have read the bible so you know that the Kingdom of God is inside of YOU, right?  You say &quot;The pride of a person...&quot;, but what about YOU?  That is what you are responsible for.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think this is morally OK ? </p>

<p>Deuteronomy 22:28-29 “If a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies with her, and they are found, then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he has violated her. He may not divorce her all his days.</p>
