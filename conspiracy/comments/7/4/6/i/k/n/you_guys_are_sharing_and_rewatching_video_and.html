<p>Then I came to this sub, and realized how many of you are watching (and rewatching) multiple videos of the event. People are dying in these videos and y&#39;all are arguing about echos and physics and gun differences. </p>

<p>And then I see the dead shooter photo and the detachment of the comments. </p>

<p>Whatever the motive, facts or agenda of this event, YOU, human with a soul and an electromagnetic and psychic energy, YOU are adding to the darkness by absorbing, feeding and spreading this fear and blood and digitized violence. </p>

<p>Take a moment away from your screen. Light a candle, burn some sage, stare at the almost full moon, take a walk in the woods, hold open a door for a stranger, go adopt a shelter pet, do ANYTHING for one day away from this event. </p>

<p>Fuck, micro analysis of this crime scene is only hurting yourself in the long run and taking just another small bite out of the human consciousness.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t watch Faces of Death anymore. I&#39;ve smelled human decomposition. I&#39;ve buried more friends than I&#39;ve kept from high school. I don&#39;t need to give some asshat YouTube monetization income from viewing the different angles and experiences of this event. </p>

<p>bro, i&#39;m not gonna stop you from being an esoteric nuthead, but keep your shit for yourself.</p>

<p>if anything, <em>you</em> lost touch with reality, which - okay, your life, your thing. but in the very second you want to talk strangers into your bullshit, you forgot your place.</p>

<p>stay in your community of reality-denying hippies and leave other communities to them. this is &#39;r/conspiracy&#39;, the <em>idea</em> is literally to spin heads around weird stuff in a fact-based manner.</p>

<p>your &#39;electromagnetic and psychic energy&#39; bullshit <em>surely</em> has its place, but its not here (and neither in any other reality-based community).</p>

<p>and just so you don&#39;t misunderstand me: i know that you have the greatest intentions, but read this:</p>

<p>&quot;electromagnetic and psychic energy&quot;, as a concept, doesn&#39;t belong anywhere but precisely in the community that embraces such concepts: esotericism.</p>

<p>you present your concepts as facts, but they are not. thats the same thing religions do. they make shit up because it feels good, and then they present it as facts. this <em>never</em> ends good. get your act together, know your place, do your homework, stop talking strangers into your bubble. because thats what it is - a bubble. why i <strong>know</strong> that? because, opposed to you, i actually did my homework instead of just fleeing into a mental safe space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Essentially, OP, what this boils down to is, if people have come to this place on the internet, they are likely here intentionally. Nobody is forced to click on anything in this sub, and if people decide to make I puts on explanations for this tragedy, that&#39;s their business. And if other people choose to click on those posts, that&#39;s also their business, and their choice. I get that you&#39;re trying to get people to step away for a moment, from all the &quot;negative emotions that these idea pile on, but people handle their emotions differently, dude. Some people have a stronger stomach for looking at such things. That&#39;s just the way it is. There&#39;s no need for you to tell people what they should do, especially given that what you&#39;re wanting them to do, isn&#39;t much different than a religion. You&#39;re essentially trying to pull people into your practices and beliefs, and this just isnt really the place for that.</p>
