        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Considering that we have next to nothing to go on in terms of motive at this time. What if this was literally just some dude who wanted to commit suicide, but wanted to kill a bunch of people before he was forced to pull the trigger or suicide by cop. </p>

<p>There are a lot of men out there who choose to commit suicide later in life. A lot of men who feel for one reason or another life is not worth living.</p>

<p>Maybe he just felt like a worthless loser? No kids, no wife, no real friends it seems like, no close family. A wealthy former accountant aimlessly wasting his life away in casino bars with no real attachments to society.</p>

<p>Maybe he felt his own life was and had been empty and meaningless. This could have been a source of his compulsive gambling, the thrill of the bet, let the dice fall where they may, just fuck it, because wealth means nothing without a purposeful life.</p>

<p>The above characteristics could have been cause for the shooting.</p>

<p>He resents people like the ones at the country music festival. People that had friends, family, purpose, youth, excitement. And in his final high stakes game, one of life and death, he would roll the dice for 20 000 people all at once by firing indiscriminately into the crowd from a penthouse suite. In 10 minutes he would purposefully go from being &quot;just a guy&quot; in his brothers words, to become one of the most discussed individuals in American history.</p>

<p>I heard he was actually a country music fan and attended concerts regularly. This isn&#39;t hatred for politics or race or religion. This sounds like an envy killing of the purest variety. </p>

<p>My point was that the answer to &quot;How do you get an automatic weapon?&quot; is as simple as buying a regular semi-automatic weapon and converting it to fully automatic operation. It&#39;s not even hard.</p>

<p>With all the crazy speculation circulating on this subreddit about this guy right now I tried to do what Sheriff Joe Lombardo said he couldn&#39;t do when he said &quot;I can&#39;t get into the mind of a psychopath at this point.&quot; </p>

<p>And no disrespect to Sheriff Lombardo, this is an unprecedented, tragic attack on this country and he is under an unimaginable amount of pressure. He&#39;s got more things to worry about right now than the rationale of some fuckin sore loser.</p>

<p>The FBI psychs will need to take their time to digging up this guys entire life, that&#39;s why this motive thing has taken so long. </p>

<p>Sadly Stephen Paddock is one of the sick fucks that people will be making documentaries about for years to come, which seems ironically is exactly what he wanted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you not assume there is someting happening behind the curtain with this guy? Occam&#39;s razor thinking is only useful in certain situations, and as others have said, there was way too much forethought put into this. </p>

<p>If he was angry enough to want to kill a bunch of people, you&#39;d think he would probably target somebody he is upset with - considering he&#39;s upset enough to mass murder a crowd.</p>

<p>The action is too heavy for a shallow, light motive. If this were something that happened quite often, then maybe you can write it off as happenstance, but this was planned and the response was not typical either. Too many questions. By making a shallow judgement, you are being horrendously ignorant.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fine to say we dont&#39; know yet, but I noticed one other thing with your take - do you not believe there is any chance that the intelligence community or bad government actors might be involved? Is it impossible in your mind that the shooter was actually connected to the FBI?</p>

<p>Yeah he worked for a predecessor company to Lockheed, as an accountant. He also worked for the IRS and DOD for probably similar reasons and in similar roles. </p>

<p>Just because you worked for the HSBC doesn&#39;t mean you were directly involved in handling money for drug cartels.</p>

<p>The government connections just don&#39;t add up, but I guess if he was undercover or working some crooked shit outside the bureau itself, they were never meant to. Just doesn&#39;t seem like the kind of guy to be involved in some undercover or illicit weapons deals, but we don&#39;t know the full story yet. </p>

<p>Still all possible though. I&#39;m not trying to discount other theories, just trying to work out the simplest most likely theory with what we&#39;ve got.</p>

<p>Why would someone neatly stack used magazines in middle of massacring people? That makes zero sense on multiple levels.</p>

<p>Equally implausible is that they were never full in the first place then neatly stacked on the floor.</p>

It wasn&#39;t my intention to emphasis that the mags themselves represent the mystery of the case. Rather just it was a detail needed to be cataloged in my brain, that I still have questions about. </p>

<p>Sincerely thank you for taking the time to discuss this with me. I have learned something today and will try and put it to practical use.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol no never heard of it. Apparently you don’t have the “simple understanding of the laws of physics”.

<p>It’s okay, I saw Loose Change too. I also saw the directors of Loose Change get obliterated by the Editors of Popular Mechanics in a debate regarding this topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. It doesn&#39;t. The mass of the top section is less than the bottom, momentum wouldn&#39;t have allowed it to collapse fully into it&#39;s own footprint. </p>

<p>How can an office fire only visible on two floors from the outside cause wtc7 to disappear in under a minute? The only way that&#39;s possible is if the steel beams were cut. And you can see the pictures of ground zero with classic demolition style diagonal cuts on the beams. Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel, and even if it could, there wasn&#39;t nearly enough left over from the initial explosion to heat up the entire building to bring it down. </p>

<p>Watch architects and engineers on 911. And get off of this sub if you&#39;re not willing to open your mind beyond the mainstream narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good lord. Your first paragraph makes zero sense. Your saying that when multiple floors collapse, the floor directly below can hold them all up? This is called pancaking. </p>

<p>-There were fire on multiple floors of WC7 plus it was wrecked by falling debris from the collapse of the other towers. 
-You see a couple beams that look sliced, that is not evidence of high powered machinery. 
-JET FUEL DOESNT NEED TO MELT STEEL BEAMS JUST DAMAGE THE INTEGRITY OF THEM AND WEAKEN THEM. 
-Regardless, the jet fuel ignited fires all over the place, it was an office after-all, with flammable objects. </p>

<p>Yes powerful interests seek to manipulate events, but if you can just let something happen on it&#39;s own why not?</p>

<p>That&#39;s basically what I think happened with 9/11, and yeah no need to go into the details, I&#39;ve seen them all 100 times.</p>

<p>What would be easier?</p>

<p>Conducting a deeply covert attack on your own country involving hundreds or possibly thousands of people. Maybe thermite, maybe a missile to strike the Pentagon, demolition charges in tower 7 to cover up the FBI involvement.</p>

<p>Or getting some intel that &quot;Osama Bin Laden determined to strike within the United States,&quot; and then just letting that shit happen so you can use it to your own advantage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter what is easiest, it&#39;s what the facts point to. And the facts point to Osama bin Laden being a CIA asset from the beginning.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easier to say Oswald was a lone gunman, just like it&#39;s easier to say weed rots your brain so it should be illegal. But the facts are that it&#39;s physically impossible for two airplanes to bring down three concrete steel beamed skyscrapers in under 1 minute each. Sure, they were burning, but anyone watching the videos knows there is no visible structural failure until it just vanishes. Especially WTC7. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the facts and you can&#39;t just brush them off because it&#39;s easier for you. Take Eric Braverman&#39;s advice and just follow the money. That&#39;s what the researcher who did Rich man&#39;s trick did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Posting my earlier comment here:
Couldnt this dude have been a hardcore leftist who orchestrated the worst lone wolf attack in US history for the specific purpose of setting up the political landscape in favor of harsher gun laws? He could have known that since he was white/rich/retired/successful the only thing left to talk about is the gun, of which he owned legally and modified using legally sold shit?</p>

<p>So he carries out the shooting and its fucking devastating in a very short period, to the point that its obvious he had set a new record, at which point he stops and shoots himself in the head. He had enough ammo and time to kill every person who stuck around, along with surveillance outside his door; everything points to him bunkering down. But he doesnt even try to fight off police because he kills himself a full hour before they bust down his hotel door.</p>

<p>If he had started shooting again after the first 9 minute wave (when medical assistance was being given), the results would be absolutely more horrific. Deaths would certaintly have been 100+ in my opinion.</p>

<p>Idk what to think really. I don&#39;t believe this dude was an FBI agent and that this thing goes very deep. I think its simple because it was almost politicised by design, but I also know that us humans use logic to try to cope when horrible things happen. People die and we identify with it and reflect ourselves and our loved ones and try to make sense of horrible things, but sometimes it just doesn&#39;t make sense. The theory that hes an old idiotic athiest that wanted to live out his rambo fantasy fits just as well unfortunately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most difficult in piloting is in takeoff and landing, or adverse conditions. Flying the jet in good weather is trivial. Did the US government know about and not stop, or maybe even sponsor, the attack? Probably. But why bother with a risky controlled demolition when you have groups you can prod into doing it for you? Hell, I bet they didn&#39;t plan for the towers to actually come down, just sustain enough damage to launch a war for that Halliburton dosh.</p>

<p>JFK&#39;s angle matches Oswald perfectly. He already had anti-American sentiments and military experience. Most likely paid and promised an assisted escape once in prison (so he wouldn&#39;t talk upon arrest) by the Rothschilds (could be CIA or a few other groups, but my bet is Federal Reserve based) and then killed by Ruby before he could talk. With Ruby mysteriously dying in prison. No need for a second shooter for elite involvement. They&#39;d want their tracks as covered as possible anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not laughable, the thread is laughable. That is the null hypothesis. Restating the null hypothesis as if it&#39;s insightful isn&#39;t really something I&#39;d expect to find on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. That&#39;s more of <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> territory. The poster above me sums it up better than I can, with satire:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if 19 hijackers with no commercial jet experience actually just wanted to take down 3 buildings with 2 planes?</p>

<p>What if Oswald actually was an ace commie assassin with a magic bullet?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s laughable because while both of those explanations are definitely possible, taking the most basic and obvious explanation for an event is not something I really appreciate reading on a <em>conspiracy subreddit.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO it&#39;s also very convenient for people trying to push the gun control narrative; if he&#39;s just some random dude with absolutely no political motive it&#39;s a lot easier to push the &quot;we need to ban all guns&quot; angle than if he were radicalized by oh I don&#39;t know the John Brown Gun Club or similar radical Antifa affiliated organizations. Not saying that&#39;s what happened, not saying he&#39;s <em>not</em> some random crazy subhuman animal, but concluding there is no deeper motivation is at this point very premature.</p>

<p>The sheriff&#39;s comments last night were somewhat odd, and there&#39;s at least some evidence to suggest other people knew about his plot (why would he just up and send his SO back to the Philippines and write her a check for 100Gs? What of the people at the concert who said there were people telling them they were all going to die?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the point is that if you spend a lot of time on this subreddit you can start to see conspiracy where none exists. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure either way on this one, there is a lot of strange things about this situation and I hope we get more information in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>I think sometimes people need reminding though that bad things actually do just happen for no reason. Sometimes someone just snaps. It&#39;s not always a big conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the entirety of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> these days. But let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s not astroturf. The sad truth is that this is the GenPop of reddit making a beachhead here. As the subscriber numbers grow, it&#39;s going to continue to be more and more basic-bitch. I&#39;ve seen it happen over the last year or so especially. &quot;They use the two party system to divide us&quot; has been almost totally replaced with &quot;You&#39;re a T_D/ShareBlue shill!!&quot; accusations (buying into the very obvious D&amp;C hyperpartisan tactics carried over from places like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> or <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>.) Expect <em>way</em> more of this. Also, expect <em>way</em> more people lobbing accusations of &quot;tinfoil&quot; or the like. You can see it clear as day in this thread: comments such as &quot;LOL THANKS FOR THE LOGICAL POST xD&quot; are legion, even though this post really doesn&#39;t belong on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> (it&#39;s restating the null hypothesis, not a conspiracy theory.) </p>

<p>Anyway, sorry for the rant. But yeah, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is shit now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking about how he would smuggle so many guns in without anyone noticing. But why would he need to buy 33 guns within 12 months?! I feel that maybe he was selling guns to the black market (cartels, some speculate ISIS). Whether it be an inside job or a botched job..something doesn&#39;t add up. Also someone posted that his private plane is now owned by a defense company. Per his previous employment history, he clearly had to have security clearance. My dad works for a defense company, govt always keeps tabs. It&#39;s difficult to understand how he could have planned such a horrendous act in advance without any red flags. </p>

<li><p>Girlfriend was a 62 year old retired high-stakes hostess who seemed to be away more often then not. She might have loved him, might have been the only person he thought loved him -- ( point 5.) possibly the reason for the wire transfer, possibly to her family in the Philippines.</p></li>
<li><p>Lived a reclusive life in a retirement community 80 miles outside the city and according to neighbors he kept his houses rather bare and spent most time in town gambling. Staff that knew him as a regular considered him nice, but a bit of a slob, a bit of a schmuck, a well comped whale -- He had money, but this isn&#39;t some Hugh Hefner lifestyle we&#39;re talking about here.</p></li>
<li><p>His mom seemed to be the only person he was emotionally close to, possibly because he and his brother Eric never knew their father.

<p>Someone with his means could have boosted his ego much more easily.

<p>The logistics of getting that particular room, well in advance of the concert, moving all that equipment up there, setting up cameras, etc, etc... Way too involved for someone just wanting to go out in a blaze of glory.</p>

<p>Just my humble opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The number of guns is a little odd and puts a strange spin on the level of planning. You could probably reasonably plan this in a weekend. Get 5 rifles, plenty of rounds might take a couple weeks, but I know nothing about that stuff. He likely had stayed at the hotel when there was an event in that area, maybe even in a similar room. So the only planning needed would be to say &quot;id like to stay in the room I stayed in before or on the same side&quot; and to look up when an event would be at the venue. Order cameras online and get a big suitcase, etc. </p>

<p>However, it is clear he did plan this out, which makes a few things odd. </p>

<p>23 guns. Why? Maybe he had accomplices that backed out at the end?</p>

<p>Security guard shot through the door. Doesn&#39;t seem to match the police scanners. </p>

<p>No info about bags in his room or how he got to the hotel that I have seen. </p>

<p>Plenty of rounds not used. And long pauses in his shooting. You&#39;d think with the number of guns and amount of ammo, the goal would be to shoot as much and as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>Kind of brings me back to the Boston bombing and how the bombers acted after the shooting, going on that strange, GTA-esque spree through Boston. It almost seemed like they saw they were being blamed for the attack were surprised to see that and freaked out. For someone that had planned something like that and expected to get away with it, I would expect there to be an exit strategy and an understanding that they would be identified. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hijacking this comment a bit to share my story</p>

<p>I was in the woods, at a music festival, frying face in the woods when this all went down</p>

<p>I was in the overflow section of the campgrounds, in a spot I&#39;d never been in before. Apparently it is close to a shooting range, which I didn&#39;t fully realize until the next morning</p>

<p>Instead, when the sun came up, I was greeted by the sound of people revving their bike engines and gunfire</p>

<p>Tripping, I was terrified. I imagined this whole scenario very similar to what OP described, except with a group. I thought maybe a group of biker misfits had enough and were about to roll through the campgrounds capping people and raping chicks to get their revenge for being rejected by the party atmosphere of the festival grounds.</p>

<p>I was horrified to get home and find out that the same weekend, my nightmare was coming true in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>I desperately hope that this is some kind of heavily orchestrated ISIS attack, because to me, the notion that loneliness can just make someone snap like this is even more terrifying to me</p>

Imagine a world where at any moment some person can lose it and kill people indiscriminately. No rhyme no reason, no grand scheme or sexy plot line.

    <div class="md"><p>It is possible, but unlikely.  But we can admit its a possible scenario.  From a shut and close case, it looks that simple dont it? Nothing to see here, move along.  Just a gun nut that had debt so he offed himself after killing a bunch of people he didnt know, that was all preplanned for a long time, booked ahead, he had cameras setup, a ton of guns, he used to work for lockemartin, though he was super quiet and just &quot;hung out&quot; and had a low key life....but next his brother and everyone is saying, oh no he made us rich abd was a huge gambler and he just was so good at gambling he was rich and lived a large life and blah blah.  Which is the opposite of what the bro said before. The bro was probably involved in with what his brother did or at the least knew about his bro being a spook that made money doing &quot;defense contracting deals&quot; that are actually illegal, but they regularly met at the casio hotels and did deals there.  Gambling in vegas is a great cover and a easy way to launder money.  His wife either knows about everything and theyll somehow &quot;silence&quot; her, or shes an idiot that was just with this guy for his money.  The family is suspect for sure, either knew what he did and covered for him and spun it like it wasnt bad, and now his bro is kinda nervously covering and acting weird cuz he knows hr could be in huge trouble for taking money and knowing his bro did shady stuff with shady peeps </p>

<p>But I think there was some darker stuff in his past than at first glance, which is why I theorized that he was a weapons dealer who used gambling as a cover for illegal income. I don&#39;t know if it had anything to do with the shooting at all, probably not. </p>

I&#39;m not going to say that it&#39;s impossible that he just wanted to kill a bunch of random people, but I will say that it&#39;s one of the least likely possibilities, especially considering that the PTB are desperate to disarm the public in a hurry (scary shit) and this shooting arrived right on schedule.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think often people drawn to gambling have low dopamine (due to genes, poor nutrition, aging), and then they get a dopamine surge when they win allowing them to feel kind of OK for a while and it&#39;s very addictive for them. A normal serotonergic antidepressant isn&#39;t going help this kind of person much and I think it could even make him worse, so I hope details about any medication he was on come out. I think the simple explanation of depression being the reason is definitely possible. Because he is older, I would also want to rule out dementia, and I didn&#39;t see the gory pictures of his corpse but if they can check his brain for tumors I am guessing that would be good info.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve heard from his brothers account though, he wasn&#39;t the kind of guy to ask for help, so I don&#39;t think he was on any kind of medication. </p>

<p>As for dementia, he seems a bit young for that, and considering the planning involved it seems unlikely, but tumors are a very real possibility I hadn&#39;t considered.</p>

Maybe there is more to the story, maybe not, there&#39;s no way to tell with our limited vantage point. Sometimes people just snap and want to kill a bunch of people because humans are apes with guns. It could may well be the only reason this guy was so &quot;successful&quot; with his killing spree is because he was more wealthy, methodical, and intelligent than the average bear.</p>

<p>But my guess, is that he was a rich misanthropic loner who felt like lashing out at the &quot;normies&quot; who were out having fun enjoying music and camaderies in the ways that even with all of his money is was not able to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This theory and one other theory are the only theories that I will entertain until more information comes out.</p>

<p>His father was a bank robber as well, Could be a genetic trait for some kind of aggression or cloudy thinking / mentally torn up. Or He maybe felt like he needed to one up his father in some sick strange way that he never got to do.. even in being successful in his life.. and watching it be completely meaningless without happiness? Possible that all of what you said is true and some of this could be tied into his brain.</p>

<p>The only other theory Is that he was a patsy. He was happy just living it up. But had outstanding debts.. and was offered a deal to do an arms trade in his hotel. He takes xxx amount of bags into a room as seen in some footage to be released any day now.. Once all the guns are there they shoot him, two guys shoot up the crowd and leave. Legislation gets pushed through for metal detectors in buildings that have more than xxx amount of floors in metro areas.. Metal Detector businesses make millions since it&#39;s quite obvious that after sandy hook guns aren&#39;t going to be pried out of anyone&#39;s cold dead hands... who else could stand to make money?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t buy into the isis crap or that he was a CIA agent and something he was doing fell apart very badly and someone else did it or that he was forced to do it. There are too many holes in those theories still. And usually, even in conspiracies the most obvious answer is the correct one. </p>

<p>He might have planned to keep shooting. He might have wanted to try them all out when he planned this, but for some reason he stopped. We don&#39;t know why as of yet.</p>

<p>The point about strawmanning was that you said:</p>

<p>this sounds to me like you&#39;re saying: he just so happened to have 23 guns with him, and then all of a sudden wanted to &quot;try out&quot; just a few of them before committing suicide. Apparently that&#39;s not what you meant? hmph. </p>

<p>So now you&#39;re thinking... maybe he brought all 23 of the guns, because they were all his favorites, and he just wouldn&#39;t be able to pick a fewer number than that- and maybe he really wanted to use all 23 of his favorite guns... but then he lost the will for life after &quot;trying out&quot; just 5 of them... yeah, maybe.  </p>

<p>With all the crazy speculation circulating on this subreddit about this guy right now I tried to do what Sheriff Joe Lombardo said he couldn&#39;t do when he said &quot;I can&#39;t get into the mind of a psychopath at this point.&quot; </p>

<p>And no disrespect to Sheriff Lombardo, this is an unprecedented, tragic attack on this country and he is under an unimaginable amount of pressure. He&#39;s got more things to worry about right now than the rationale of some fuckin sore loser.</p>

<p>The FBI psychs will need to take their time to digging up this guys entire life, that&#39;s why this motive thing has taken so long. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said there was no mystery about the magazines and you jumped to &quot;Everything we need to know has already been told. Time to write this in the annuals of history. The End.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s passive aggressive and frankly seems a tad unhinged.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of questions I have about why Paddock decided to shoot up a concert. However, why there is a stack of magazines in his hotel room near the window isn&#39;t one of them. It&#39;s entirely in concordance with his activities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>and this is why you could and might easily over look details. no one knows if the stacks are empty or full (assumption, full). no one knows if he simply didnt get to them, or for some reason decided to stack them back up (assumption, didnt get to them). </p>

<p>unless we were to ever get unadultered access to the evidence as it was found, or access to the supposed video he recorded of himself (if that existed, might explain a lot), there is no way that we will ever know what truly happened. </p>

<p>you can take a single still frame out of context and make up any story about it that you want, but unless you were there, unless you have some other information other than being able to look at a damn picture, you have no idea what happened precisely. </p>

<p>it is perfectly fine to make assumptions about what you believe could have happened. It is quite different to phrase it as knowing or proving that something happened a specific way. </p>

<p>I am not quite sure why you think that a situation like this would all play out to the perfect logic in your head. If Paddock did this, he wasnt using logic. Logic would guide him away from murdering others and himself. <strong>IF</strong> it was him, I do not believe he was thinking logically, and therefore I do not believe that your logic definitively applies to his actions. </p>

<p>Another video is about the human brain and psychology. It&#39;s my favorite video because it shows you what your ego is and why letting go of that illusory &quot;self&quot; is how you are able to see beyond yourself. And trust me hombre, you&#39;ve got a big one. </p>
