<p>You&#39;re the one who has to explain away genocide and the most vile form of racism on the planet.  Good luck with that.  I say good luck because in order to rationalize it, you have to invent reasons that aren&#39;t found in the bible, or search in other parts of the Bible, and retroactively apply them to Canaanites and Egyptians.</p>

<p>Please, explain why the slaughter of the Canaanites, and the infanticide of all Egyptian firstborns was &quot;required&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately the context begins in Genesis 3:15 and Genesis 6:4. The Canaanites were involved in genetic manipulation of humans and animals and that&#39;s why even the animals were to be slaughtered on some occasions and laws in place killing the animals in case humans had sex with them, and the Passover has a few meanings, #1 that faith and obedience in God will preserve your life, #2 that disobedience from God will mean death and #3 maybe the most important one that this is a foreshadowing of what God himself was going to allow happen to his own firstborn of the creation, his only son the Lamb. Who would have his blood spilled out symbolically as the lamb blood on their doorposts. </p>

Every man, woman, child, animal, and stone in Jericho had to die, because they had secret, (unmentioned) genetic engineering labs hidden in them.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>And your excusal of the infanticide of Egypt is vapid, has no meaning.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The genetic manipulation and unauthorized hybrids are mentioned many times, first mention is in Genesis 6. Deuteronomy 3:11 describes the king of one of these old tribes as having a bed 9 cubits long and 4 cubits wide. That&#39;s over 13&#39; tall and 6&#39; wide. Not to mention Goliath and other giants. If you don&#39;t we want to accept the Bible or these things written in it that&#39;s one thing but the Bible 100% describes the genetic tampering that happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the DNA tampering that gets you in trouble, the flood was sent to wipe out the ancient world because of what was going on, the stories of ancient Greece and the Titans and the hybrid creatures is real and supported by all religions. The same technology is being ushered in as we speak. Once you cross species  something happens and it is an abomination. Genesis 3:15 was the division and plan to save mankind and talks of a seed (genetic) war that was coming, Satan knew his plan would fail if the perfect man Jesus was born and he almost succeeded in defiling the whole earth pre flood by manipulating the DNA of man to prevent this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>21 Every living thing that moved on land perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind. 22 Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. 23 Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.</p>

That&#39;s a big problem, if they mysteriously popped up much much later in the Bible timeline, with no mentioned source.

<p>Those aren&#39;t <em>words,</em> man. Those are actions. If somebody <em>says</em> &quot;I think we should cut off girls&#39; privates&quot; then, I mean, shutting that person up by coercion or whatever is just not what we do. We want to be tolerated ourselves, so we tolerate those who offend us. And like I said, bad ideas have a tendency, most of the time, to die on their own.

    <div class="md"><p>Please show me the verse for your first statement, keeping in mind that (supposedly) he then let ~2000 years worth of Jews live and suffer under the punishments of the first covenant, with literally no hope for salvation.</p>

<p>And Jesus regularly flouted many rules of the Torah, so if he was supposed to be the only one to fully uphold them, he failed miserably, by his own admission.  Looks like you&#39;ll have to wait for a different human sacrifice to come around.</p>

<p>And btw, if you&#39;ve ever trimmed your sideburns, sucks to be you, but you broke the law.  And if you rape somebody, make sure that nobody hears it, so it can be her fault.  You&#39;ll get to either marry her, or kill her, then, so it&#39;s kinda like a win/win/win for Jews and Christian&#39;s.</p>
