        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From everything we&#39;ve read thus far, my theory of some kind of &quot;cell&quot; is growing, though I don&#39;t completely rule out that a guy with the means to make a big event, went crazy. </p>

<p>Think about how many guns were brought in, and also not brought in, how about the explosives, and their specific use?</p>

<p>He brought up way too many guns to use alone, two perches, but he....also planned to escape, which means he couldn&#39;t just sit there for an hour firing off thousands of rounds. </p>

<p>He shot at jet fuel tanks, but he had explosives which are basically perfect for helping blow up a fuel tank in the car, which makes me question if someone else&#39;s job was to get those explosives over to the tank to be shot and ignited. </p>

<p>It seems this entire operation was built for at least two or more people to carry out, but Paddok was left alone, so he did his part, realized it was compromised and shot himself knowing he wouldn&#39;t be able to escape. Perhaps the reason he thought he could escape, was there was supposed to be so much carnage happening all around, that the police wouldn&#39;t be able to mobilize on him as quickly or at least not with their full focus. </p>

<p>Las Vegas is a very corrupt place that covers up crimes and murders on a daily basis to keep the tourism dollars coming. I&#39;d estimate that dozens of violent and/or unsettling crimes are swept under the rug each day. </p>

<p>It would be in A LOT of people&#39;s interest, to keep the idea of multiple conspirators still at large completely out of the public unless they had no choice. </p>

<p>A lone wolf won&#39;t destroy business, the bad guy is dead, but if we knew there were more potential attacks by an organized cell of some kind, people would be cancelling their trips left and right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not when the safety and security of royalty, and most especially Saudi royalty, and extraordinarily wealthy people from around the world are concerned. If anything happened to any of them it might well cause an international incident, so yes there are extraordinary security measures that they&#39;re also not going to admit or reveal anything about.</p>

<p>The super rich that stay there of course pay for that kind of protection and they also pay for that security to be discrete and keep their mouths shut about anything that might publicly embarrass any of those clients who spend a pile of money every time they visit and stay in that very hotel precisely because of that.</p>

<p>The Four Seasons at the Mandalay was a huge money maker for the chain and it&#39;s pretty plain that it&#39;s going to be making a whole lot less off it now because this incident was <em>allowed to happen</em>. </p>

<p>So the Four Seasons will probably be compensated in some way for that &quot;inconvenience&quot; or has some back up plan to keep and look after those major clients somewhere else in Vegas after this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely would believe this theory. If Stephen truly has a wound in his stomach then he could&#39;ve been shot by his accomplice. Stephen was found in the main room. Second window in the adjoined room is on his right hand side behind him. It&#39;s quite possible that this is a two person job and Stephen was set up as the patsy while the other person left to do more or hide nearby. There was enough time for them to do so given that swat took near an hour to breach. I skimmed the police scanner and recalled hearing the security guard that got shot went down a few levels way before the swat team got to the 32nd floor to breach. Definitely enough time to getaway. </p>

He could have busted the second window out to allow the wind to blow through and clear the smoke after the room started filling up,  too. For some reason, those buildings always have a huge pressure difference if you open more than one entry point for the air to flow through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely a possibility, the things that make me lean towards a single shooter is the audio (no point where two people are shooting at the same time, at least from the audio I&#39;ve heard) and no reasonable explanation why the second shooter would have bailed only a few minutes in (don&#39;t think he could have left after the security guy gets there).

    <div class="md"><p>I think those are some of the logistic reasons that keep this from being a real debate and keep it in the “conspiracy theory” territory. You’re correct about all of those. Any other ideas are basically pure speculation at this point. For me, it’s almost 50/50. I feel like it’s a coin flip. Either things are exactly how they’re saying or something <em>big</em> is off. Honestly, I hope it’s just a crazy dude who had the means,  time, and physical ability. As scary as that would be as far as our ability to mitigate future attacks, it wouldn’t be as scary to me as an entire group of operatives working behind the scenes to murder large groups of American citizens to accomplish different agendas like taking our rights and making their buddies lots of money...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you 100%, there are things that just feel off about it, but the more I look at it, the more I feel like it&#39;s a guy who had some sort of weird fantasy of the perfect mass murder event but once he got to the point of execution, everything started to fall apart. People talk about the planning, but I just don&#39;t see anything particularly complex about what he did. He bought a lot of guns (not hard for an older rich white guy), rented a hotel room (again, not hard or unusual for him) and carried a bunch of bags to his room, which is weird but again because of his demographics probably wouldn&#39;t get a second glance. It looks like maybe he thought about explosives and possibly thought he could escape n but both of those things would have taken real complex planning. I don&#39;t want to end up on a list, but I can think of at least 5 things I can think of, off the top of my head that wouldn&#39;t have been particularly hard but would have made his chances of escaping higher. But even then, he didn&#39;t even try to hide his identity, so what good would escaping have done? If it&#39;s a cover up for something, why make it look so half assed? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I’ve been telling people for years that it wouldn’t be particularly hard for a person to pull something like this off. There are too many ways we’re open to it. Not even firearms related. Society has to operate on a high degree of “trust that guy won’t do something fucked up”...and that something could be anything humanly valuable in day to day life. I’m not going to going to get into it, but as a new father, it’s becoming much much easier to see the ways I’m vulnerable, and society as a whole.</p>

<p>I think that’s what’s scary about these things. There’s no way to keep them from happening AND remain fully free ourselves. At least if it were a shadowy group of conspirators we could do <em>something</em> to stop them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think they were the shooters that some employees and patrons are reporting in other casinos? Seems odd to me that someone wasn&#39;t up there with him raining down bullets since if escape was the plan, it would have had to be a fast shoot and run. </p>

<p>Also seems odd that explosives were ready, but not used. Maybe one of them got hung up or couldn&#39;t make it in time, but I&#39;m really thinking someone was supposed to get those explosives over to the tanks and either shoot them from a distance or leave them for Paddok to hit with one of the scope rifles up top. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, &quot;planning everything perfectly&quot; pretty much just involved buying some guns, booking a hotel room and spending a few days smuggling them into the room. Nothing we&#39;ve seen is overly complex, and it was made even easier by the fact that he&#39;s a rich white guy. The stuff that would have actually taken real planning, like explosives or a viable escape route, didn&#39;t happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was there footage of that lady screaming that stuff?  Because all I saw was the interview with the teenager who made the claims. Assuming that the screaming lady story is true, it would show that she had her hand in this in some way, shape, or form.  But the thing that sticks out to me is why she didn&#39;t inform the police?  Or what if she did, and they ignored her?  We need to find out who it was that was screaming that shit, and get an interview out of her.  That would be the key to blowing this wide open.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I wouldn&#39;t even say he planned it out well. I mean yeah. He set up a couple cameras to check a hall way and apparently the lobby. Still &#39;shot himself&#39; with plenty of time to carry on shooting or escape like they suggest he wanted too. If his goal was specifically loss of life he could of done it much better, especially if he doesn&#39;t mind dying at the end. It&#39;s not like they had ANY idea who he was at first. He could of just put another bullet in the security guard and ran out of the room screamin about a gunman when he sees police. Got his pistol, got in his car and gone boom.</p>

<p>My theory is he got wet feet after shooting security because of how close he was lmao, shooting at people from a 32nd floor across a street would be like playing CoD if your down for murder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t think about it until you mentioned about shooting the guard and ran down the hall steaming about a shooter. He could have easily done this and gotten away with as much hysteria that was going on and the fact that he was well known at these casinos. He could have easily gotten away in his car and detonated the explosives or just drove off and claimed a new identity. The dude had a butt load of money so it wouldn&#39;t have been an issue for him to take that route.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. The question is why didn&#39;t he. Evidence he wanted to escape. Okay. So why didn&#39;t he? </p>

<p>1) somebody set him up as a fall guy and they got away.</p>

<p>2) he really had no plan to escape and decided he didn&#39;t want to risk being captured. If this is the case then why have a car filled with apparent explosives.</p>

<p>3) Apparent arms deal setup for CIA gone bad with ISIS.   This isn&#39;t ISIS style. Youd know if it was ISIS by now.</p>

<p>4) Suicide because the security came in and it broke him out of his trance. You don&#39;t do this kind of shit without atleast sort of zoning out. He saw security. Panicked, assuming they knew where he was( If I was commiting mass murder and someone walked in id assume they knew too) and realising what he&#39;d actually done, shot himself</p>

<p>I&#39;d stop trying to think of reasons why he did it and start trying to work it backwards. Why didn&#39;t he leave in the hour or so he had before swat arrived </p>

<p>This is apparently a clever man, after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they wasn&#39;t. He&#39;d had a good 10 minutes after shooting security until the two police officers arrived. And even then they didn&#39;t sit outside the room they sat in a stairwell so he couldn&#39;t escape and they wanted reinforcements. Then did room to room clears because he&#39;d stopped shooting. At any point he could of ran away shouting about somebody with a gun. Nobody would of even tried to stop him. </p>

<p>A detonator can malfunction, the range might have been overestimated, this is an old guy who probably never did much fucking around with electronics and even basic wiring. </p>

I am going to have a bitch of a time pulling that info up because I saw this story months ago, but the basic story was that an undercover agent or two started chatting up the ill person, trying to encourage him to carry out some sort of bombing attack with them.  When he started to follow through, he was busted and put in jail.  Part of me thinks this could be a senario, but instead of intervening, the agent(s) let him do his thing, perhaps to push an adgenda.  </p>

<p>But anyways, i agree with you on pretty much everything there.  Our shitty fucking alphabet agencies have been getting away with this for so long, and i do anticipate that they had at least prior knowledge that this was going to occur.  False flag events have been very frequent recently, and I am sure it is because they are testing the waters to see what works and what doesn&#39;t.

<p>Did you know that a serial killer was offing tourists here quite often a few years ago? Oh you never heard that? probably because it would have been bad for business. He was never caught.</p>

<p>Over 1000 people die here each year, some of natural causes, some of suicides, some of accidents, but a good number of deaths are &quot;reclassified&quot; into less scary labels to make an unfortunate thing like murder, vanish. </p>

<p>the woman warning people at the front of the stage was involved and the shooting of the crowd, that seems to be entirely conentrated on that area in front of the stage, was actualy an attempt to kill her.</p>

<p>The other potential to me because those handgun shots are 10 seconds apart and completely out of place is that someone was in the room with him, they might not have done any shooting, but they killed him to make sure he wasn&#39;t taken alive or surrendered so that he couldn&#39;t give up their identity, and then they walked out of the other suite, into another one. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why there&#39;s two windows blown, &#39;two shooters&#39; etc. It was both of them. </p>

<p>The adjoining doors betwee the two rooms was locked and had to be blown. If there was just one shooter using both rooms, he wouldnt lock the internal door. The security guard mentioned that the external door was adjar. This is because Eric left. They deliberately chose a suite next to the stairwell so he could escape.</p>

<p>Stephen and Eric look and dress similar, they ID&#39;ed as each other which is why Stephen was in the hotel earlier than it appears. That was Eric.</p>

Problem with that is the hotel staff knew he was there.  Room service, comped room, paper trail on all the guns. If he actually did this shooting he didn&#39;t plan on getting away. Even if he managed to make it somewhere with no extradition treaty he would have to assume we&#39;d still get to him somehow. But...I don&#39;t think he was alone. I&#39;m really leaning to the idea he was a patsy that had no clue he was about to become involved in someting like this. He was used. Setup. Put down. Hell, at this point I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find out he didn&#39;t even bring any of those weapons in.
