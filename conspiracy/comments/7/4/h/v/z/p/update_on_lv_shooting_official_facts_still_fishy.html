        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is a good bulleted list by Unbiased America on the newest known facts about the shooting. Nothing still seems to be adding up. Are they as confused as we are, or are they hiding something? Is there another attack still in the works they are trying to stop? Who are the accomplices? What was the motive? Why did it take so long to breach the room (one that he supposedly shot through the door of) and why would he kill himself after a brief encounter with a security guard he could have easily killed? Still so many questions. </p>

<p>VEGAS SHOOTING UPDATE: MORE NEW INFORMATION HAS COME OUT
by Kevin Ryan</p>

<p>There is a lot of new information to report today on the Vegas attack.</p>

<ul>
<li>In a news conference Wednesday night, many new facts were revealed:</li>
</ul>

<p>• There were 58 deaths (not including the suspect) and 489 people were wounded; 317 have been discharged from area hospitals; 172 remain hospitalized.</p>

<p>• A slightly modified version of the timeline released earlier was presentd.
10:05pm - First Shots
10:12pm - First 2 officers arrive one floor below and determine the shooting is coming from directly above them
10:15 - The last shots are heard
10:17 - Officers arrive on the shooter’s floor
10:18 - Security officer tells police he was shot outside shooter’s room
10:26 to 10:30 - Officers begin clearing rooms on shooter’s floor
10:55 - Officers arrive at shooter’s room
11:20 - Officer’s breach shooter’s room, find him dead</p>

<p>• A military veteran in the room below Paddock informed authorities that the shooting was coming from directly above.</p>

<p>• The security guard who was wounded outside Paddock’s room was unarmed when he approached.  He faced well over 200 rounds of fire, but remained even after being shot, and helped arriving police until they demanded he get medical attention.</p>

<p>• It’s unknown exactly when Paddock killed himself.  He was dead when officers breached his room.  No gunfire was exchanged between police and the suspect.</p>

<p>• No suicide note has been found, though a note was found that police have not revealed the contents of.</p>

<p>• The cameras that the gunman set up to monitor the hallway outside his room were displaying the hallway live to him, not recording them.  Meaning this cameras do not have viewable video of the shooting on them.</p>

<p>• Some weapons found in the hotel room were jammed, but most were not.  3 rifles were fitted with hunting scopes.</p>

<p>• 1600 rounds of ammunition were found in Paddock’s car, and thousands of unfired rounds in his hotel room.</p>

<p>• Also found in the shooter’s car was ammonium nitrate (the same chemical component used in the Oklahoma City federal building bombing), and 50 pounds of tannerite, a less powerful explosive powder that detonates when shot.</p>

<p>• Paddock was gambling for several hours before the shooting.  He was not seen with a companion while he was gambling.</p>

<p>• Paddock booked several condos through Airbnb at a building called the Ogden one week before the shooting.  That was during the Life Is Beautiful concert, headlined by Chance The Rapper, Lorde, and Wiz Khalifa, in downtown Las Vegas.  Paddock may have intended to target the Life is Beautiful.</p>

<p>• The sheriff gave phone numbers for people to call if they have information on the shooter, Stephen Paddock. Within Nevada, call 311.  Outside the state, dial 702-828-3111.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sheriff Lombardo also made several pointed statements that, while not specific, may have been either informed speculation, educated guesses, or indications that he knows something but isn’t ready to give details:</li>
</ul>

<p>• The shooter had a “secret life” much of which may “never be fully understood”.</p>

<p>• The concealment of his secret life was well thought out.</p>

<p>• Something may have happened in October, 2016, that caused him to start purchasing more weapons.</p>

<p>• Authorities have a number of working theories, but aren’t ready to publicize them.</p>

<p>• The sheriff described Paddock as disturbed and dangerous.</p>

<p>• When asked whether there is &quot;evidence of domestic terrorism&quot;, the sheriff said no.</p>

<p>• The local investigation has uncovered no motive.  Paddock’s ex-wife and brother provided no information on a possible motive.  Profilers are baffled.</p>

<p>• The FBI is not yet revealing whether a motive was obtained from yesterday’s interview with Paddock’s girlfriend.</p>

<p>• It is not yet determined whether Paddock had visitors in the time before his attack.</p>

<p>• Paddock planned to survive and escape, but the sheriff did not provide what evidence led him to that conclusion.</p>

<p>• The sheriff assumes, based on all the effort that went into this, that there were accomplices.</p>

<p>• The girlfriend is cooperative, assisting, and not in custody.</p>

<ul>
<li>Other news sources have reported new information in the last day:</li>
</ul>

<p>• Associated Press: Analyzing Paddock&#39;s computer, cellphone and other electronic devices, investigators have found no obvious ideological motive, no clear connection to extremists or activist groups or outward display of mental illness.</p>

<p>• CNN: 35 people remain in critical condition</p>

<p>• Local news sources - Paddock may have tried to blow up huge aviation fuel tanks by the McCarron airport, about 1,000 feet from his firing point.</p>

<p>• Fox News sources say authorities doubt whether Paddock intentionally targeted the aviation fuel tanks, saying they may have instead been incidentally damaged by Paddock shooting toward the crowd.  The tanks are in the field of fire.</p>

<p>• Chicago police are investigating reports that Paddock may have booked rooms in a hotel overlooking Chicago’s massive Lollapalooza festival in August.  TMZ claims Paddock requested “view rooms” that would look over the festival, and his rooms had clear sightlines at the festivals’ main stage and entrance areas. Paddock apparently never showed up, though.</p>

<p>• Daily Mail: Paddock had reportedly experienced significant weight loss in the lead up to the shooting. He also developed an obsession with his girlfriend&#39;s ex-husband, Geary Danley, with whom she had been married to for more than 20 years before they finalized their divorce in 2015.  DailyMail also disclosed that other high rollers were concerned about Paddock drinking a &#39;constant stream of booze&#39; whilst he was playing.  They described him as a &#39;heavy, heavy drinker&#39; and wondered if his high alcohol intake contributed to his mental deterioration.</p>

<p>• Reuters: Paddock had severe allergies to cleaning products, makeup, and perfume, according to his brother Eric.  He often wore gardening gloves to prevent rashes from contact with cleaning chemical residues, the brother wrote. Stephen’s girlfriend Marilou Danley was sympathetic in dealing with Paddock&#39;s allergy-driven quirks, often not wearing makeup or perfume when with him.  Casinos also obliged Paddock’s request to not use chemicals when cleaning his room.</p>

<p>• New York Times: As a reward for his loyalty and gambling, Mr. Paddock stayed free of charge in the 32nd floor elite suites of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino where he staged his attack.  However, Paddock was not considered a “whale”, the term for the highest spending gamblers.</p>

<p>The Times also reports that the night before the shooting, Mr. Paddock made two complaints to the Mandalay hotel about noise coming from his downstairs neighbors: Albert Garzon, a restaurant owner visiting from San Diego and staying directly below Paddock, said security guards knocked on his door around 1:30 a.m. on Sunday and asked him to turn down his music, country songs.</p>

<p><strong>Few Vegas casinos have hotel surveillance</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Las Vegas casinos — some of the most closely watched spaces in the world — don’t have video cameras in guest room hallways&quot; (...) &quot;Yet The Associated Press found that 23 of the 27 major Strip casinos have no surveillance in hotel hallways or elevator landings. All but four of the 27 hotels are owned by MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment Corp., Las Vegas Sands Corp. or Wynn Resorts Ltd.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Few Vegas casinos have hotel surveillance</strong></p>

All but four of the 27 hotels are owned by MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment Corp., Las Vegas Sands Corp. or Wynn Resorts Ltd.&quot;</p>

<p>How long does it take to fire off 200 rounds into a hallway, anyways? I&#39;ve never fired a gun so I don&#39;t know. Seems like kind of a waste of time and resources to dump all those rounds into an empty hallway when you know that your position is comparised &amp; time is running out.</p>

 But they mean 800rpm in theory, right? not taking into account friction, the gun heating, jamming/reloading ect. </p>

<p>Like that&#39;s just one of the &quot;specifications&quot;...?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never shot a gun but would imagine shooting 200 rounds in 15 seconds would be kinda rough. Especially on the old shoulders. Of an old man lol</p>

<p>Out of the first 30 or so, let&#39;s say, 1/3 of them hit harder parts of the door or jamb or lost too much energy to do any more damage.  Another 1/3 were just way wide of the guards actual location.  If the guard was a decent distance down the hall from the door I can easily see only one of the remaining ten rounds hitting him, at which point he probably retreated to safety.  Then, if there really were 200 rounds shot, the rest were shot at an empty hall</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of those mags looked like 100 rounds mags. Plus he had 23 guns. Several reloads wouldn’t be necessary. </p>

<p>Also, your 1/3 estimates are complete conjecture. What do you mean “not do any damage”? I’d bet a close range round like the ones used could pierce a door and easily have enough energy to impact someone. Another 1/3 was wide of the guards location? How do you know, that’s a complete guess. And even if true that would leave 133 rounds to hit his general location. </p>

<p>And again at that rate of fire, the spread of bullets would incredibly close. It just doesn’t seem possible. </p>

<p>A barrage of machine gun fire with approximately 200 bullets would tear down a wall, or at least make an art statement. It can&#39;t be avoided just by going down or hiding. It just comes and you&#39;re dead. Ask the victims if they could react.</p>

<p>Also my curiosity still stands, why no footage yet? You may say that in the room corridors that are no cameras, bullshit! You think there isn&#39;t a whole squad of con artists in Las Vegas working 24/7 their ass to rip off dumb people? </p>

<p>Hotels have those cameras and security not for shootings, but to prevent robbing, con-artists, prostitutes and what else the sin-city can come up with just to taste that sweet money.</p>

<p><strong>Few Vegas casinos have hotel surveillance</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Las Vegas casinos — some of the most closely watched spaces in the world — don’t have video cameras in guest room hallways&quot; (...) &quot;Yet The Associated Press found that 23 of the 27 major Strip casinos have no surveillance in hotel hallways or elevator landings.

<p>I really think this guy suffered from some sort of mental problem that went unnoticed, like depression. Seems like he had a gambling and a drinking problem. Possibly trying to drown his sorrows.</p>

A problem arises if you&#39;re doing something that&#39;s <em>bad</em> for you but you keep doing it.    According to his brother at least, dude was fucking <em>rich</em> off gambling, so I wouldn&#39;t say he had any sort of &quot;problem&quot; gambling - considering he apparently won a shit ton of money doing it.  No gambling problem.  No drinking problem according to his brother either.  Wasn&#39;t &quot;drowning&quot; anything as far as the current data seems to show.</p>

<p>The brother said (paraphrasing) &quot;He was rich.  He literally bought our whole family houses and made sure we were all well off.  Vegas comped him literally everywhere he went because they knew he was one of their high rollers.  This makes no sense to me.  $100,000 to him was <em>nothing</em>.  He would blow that in one night because he always made so much more than that in the casinos.&quot;</p>

<p>His brother didn&#39;t make mention of any real estate.  The way he made it sound all the money he made was because he (Stephen) was just such an awesome gambler.</p>

<p>I dunno.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was also wondering about gloves, but a number of people stated that those guns get very hot. Could it be to makw sure he could continue firing? Although that would imply that he had training with those weapons, or at least would have shot them regardless. 
 Where would he be able to do this? Out in the desert? Alone? With instructor? He must have, I mean shooting a handgun repeatedly for someone who is untrained is pretty exhausting. I would think he must have, in order to sustain repeated fire for a long period. I&#39;m not sure though, never shot that type of a gun. Please feek free to correct me or clear it up.</p>

<p>I am also curious about lack of ear protection. Would his ears not start bleeding after a couple of minutes if this? That in itself would be an incredible physical stressor, especially for a 64 yo wo prior experience. Yet he pushed on for 10 minutes?</p>

<p>my guess is that he was the type of guy that never went to the doc, but you get sick enough and you know damn well something is seriously wrong especially if you&#39;re having pain or neuro symptoms. brain cancers have some overt signs that things aren&#39;t right and as it progresses you are in serious, debilitating pain (watched my mom and an acquaintance go through it). </p>

<p>he didn&#39;t talk to his brother, hadn&#39;t talked to him in 6months in fact. this guy kept to himself and it doesn&#39;t seem strange to me that he wouldn&#39;t tell anyone and sent his GF away as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, OP didn&#39;t mention the sheriff commented something to the effect that perhaps the shooter killed himself during the breach. </p>

<p>They also left out any mention of there being a gun shot between when the security guard got shot, and them breaching the room. I was very bothered that no one asked about that specifically, or perhaps they did, I couldn&#39;t hear the reporters question.</p>

<p>I think this is a key point, the timeline shows that there were police and the guard there the entire time after the guard was shot.</p>

<p>I was probably them just saying that at the time of the shooting, she was not a suspect because she wasn&#39;t in the country, but still had ties to the shooter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The security guard has a master card key that they used to clear the rooms. Why did they breach the door with explosives? Why did the sheriff state the Security Officer noticed the door was ajar? Between 1015-1115 the shooter closed the door and locked/barricaded it? Sounds like he didn&#39;t shoot himself until right before they were going to breach </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard two different things regarding Jesus Campos and what he allegedly did while trying to help. The first thing is mentioned by the OP, stating that Campos was shot outside of the room, and Metro eventually encouraged him to get treated. OP also claims that the police went around making sure the floor was clear, whereas others claim that Campos did this on one leg. I&#39;m skeptical of Campos. If he exists, he has to be tied in with something much bigger. I&#39;m not ruling him out as a suspect. I&#39;ve also wondered if he&#39;s potentially here illegally (again, if he&#39;s real), and if someone will use his alleged involvement and acts of heroism to support something in favor of DACA. Either way, there&#39;s something weird about this character in particular. I&#39;ve been to several casinos. It&#39;s uncommon for a security guard to inspect a room for a noise complaint unassisted. Even on the floor, you&#39;re almost guaranteed to see security guards paired up.</p>

Guns kick up, and when its that fast the bullets are very close together. You can draw with one.  One hit from an automatic wep is just a bit lucky. </p>
