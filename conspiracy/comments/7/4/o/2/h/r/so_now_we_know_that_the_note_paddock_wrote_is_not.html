<p>Which lives? You mean the 59 that were already ended and the 500+ that were changed forever? Whose lives are we negatively impacting by independently investigating the biggest mass shooting in us history? Why does it bother you so much that some people have theories and ideas that differ from and conflict with the mainstream narrative that&#39;s being shoveled down your throat by the MSM? Why do you come to r/conspiracy to tell people they are looking too far into things? You act high and mighty about the dangers of LARPing meanwhile you are petty enough to LARP someone who writes down numbers when they get bored to further push your viewpoint (or maybe it isn&#39;t <em>your</em> viewpoint at all). If you aren&#39;t LARPing, maybe you should get some help for your sporadic number writing out of boredom. I hear it can lead to unleashing a barrage of bullets on an innocent crowd of people.</p>
