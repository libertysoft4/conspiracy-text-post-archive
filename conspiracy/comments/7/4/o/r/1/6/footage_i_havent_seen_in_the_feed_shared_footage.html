<p>I havent seen it shared if it was sorry for resharing. Its shocking. The shots ringing through the air before all this. </p>

<p>The fucking strobe light again in between the buildings then disappearing then reappearing WTF!!! Is that a helicopter strobe light or no??? The strobe light comes back and forth during the first few mins.</p>

<p>Also from this angle as people pointed out that lower light flash was a strobe light and is flashing before the automatic rifle shooting. The fourth floor idea thing. You can see it from this angle.</p>

<p>EDIT: I repeat. im talking about the strobe light in between the buildings flying(left and right)!! </p>

<p>EDIT: People should download the video just in case youtube deletes it</p>

<p>Edit : I believe i have found the gun used in this shooting and look who is shooting it  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKbiG6UoJY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKbiG6UoJY</a></p>

<p>Edit: There is gun fire from the pyramid <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74r1fn/muzzle_flash_from_pyramid_different_angle_video/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74r1fn/muzzle_flash_from_pyramid_different_angle_video/</a>  muzzle flash different angle </p>

<p>Guys the image i will link here is a flash from the pyramid <a href="https://pasteboard.co/GNKnAA5.png">https://pasteboard.co/GNKnAA5.png</a> its blury because at the 0:43 mark it gets blury when the shot occurs from the pyramid</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This proves my thesis in my previous post that there is a possibility a helicopter was in on this!! For the same gun to be shooting in different locations it has to move. You can see it based off how people are recording they hear it to the left than pan to the right then left. This explains why some resorts heard gun fire within </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can hear the helicopter faintly while the automatic gun fire is happening. In one of the videos a girl said thats a helicopter amidst the gun fire. I hear a faint helicopter. What would explain this same strobe light flying by that hotel back and forth for the first 3mins. Im not saying the helicopter from afar was the one above the crowd. Two separate ones.  What would explain multiple resorts hearing the same automatic gun fire. Mind you the automatic weapon we hear (which is a m240 or m249 saw X 2) is not the gun by the window in the crime scene photos. The amount of shells don&#39;t add up to hundreds of rounds. That rifle in the photos is probably the rifle we hear at the beginning . </p>

<p>But i agree i think at least 2 vegas helicopters fly in the night. But why would it be there before the auto fire? They probably havent even been called yet to assess whats happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Helicopter by night is a huge Vegas attraction. People literally fly over Vegas all the time. That said, it could also be a news chopper, personal chopper or business chopper. To shoot from a moving helicopter, using full auto fire, while staying on target is very hard to do. Also, if shots of that magnitude were coming from that chopper, you&#39;d see muzzle flash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the problem is no one saw any muzzle flash from either resorts. All that is is that they hear it but can find where its coming from. This is the most mind boggling part. Why the hell cant we see it. Only reason we cant see it is if a flash hider or silencer was used. A silencer and flash hider only remove/reduce flash and not sound as killary was claiming. &quot;They wouldnt be able to hear it if a silencer was used bablabl nra is pushing it quote&quot;. Idk theres so many sketchy things such as the crime scene is staged(check my previous post about the crime scene) my main point is he did not commit suicide and was shot twice. the supposed pistol he used is in a position that defies physics, the real automatic weapon isnt disclosed(automatic one), they lied about the dates paddock was there etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much of it doesn&#39;t add up. It just makes the helicopter more eerie. You could easily use a helicopter as some sort of signal, perhaps? Who knows. Those cracks at the beginning are insane, tho. This video starts much earlier than the others, why did it take days to come out?</p>

<p>It gives new perspective, as you can see people start to run out at soon as the first couple of shots <em>crack</em> out. Harrowing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just want to point out, the fact that you&#39;re arguing for this helicopter is pretty sad.. what&#39;s more sad is that you didn&#39;t realize or point out that there were multiple silenced gunshots at 3:11 that are way earlier than anything we saw before yesterday.</p>

<p>This link has been posted multiple times, but hasn&#39;t hit the front page, because people like you are more focused on things that simply aren&#39;t true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t i say the shots before the automatic shooting??? Did you even understand why i was thinking a helicopter??? People from many resorts believed shots were coming from within. How does the same gun appear to fire from multiple locations hence the panning of the cameras? Its just a thought not a solid one but one that might explain why people from many resorts heard shots inside their resort. </p>

<p>Did you not watch the video where a girl said &quot;thats a helicopter&quot; When the automatic fire was raining down???? Thats one other reason why i think a helicopter is involved.</p>

<p>The link hasnt been posted multiple times jeez. I went into the new feed then the rising feed never saw it so i posted the link</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you said &quot;..flashing before the automatic shooting&quot;. Nothing about shots before the automatic shooting. And I made a post last night where I&#39;ve linked this video in the comments, that I found in a link someone else made in my comments.. so yes, multiple posts last night that link to this video.</p>

<p>Again, the problem is that you&#39;re focused on this helicopter that multiple people have given reasonable explanations for, while you&#39;ve repeatedly ignored how difficult, no, how nearly impossible it would be to pull off what you&#39;re proposing.</p>

<p>All while the video actually shows that the shooting happened much earlier, which is an important fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got it all wrong. That flashing strobe light is the one on the 4th floor. I was saying that because people thought a shooter was on the fourth floor but was debunked a strobe light in the room. I was saying as i stated you can see the strobe light from this angle.

I still think this was to make a point that it was too easy for him to acquire the aresnal and explosives and not to cause mass casualties.

The motive wasnt to kill, it was to push an antigun agenda and I think the LVPD is pissed that it was done in their city, thats why we are getting leaks to expose this bullshit.

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea why we cant see muzzle flash. Perhaps killary hinted to what was used before any of this evidence appeared. She was claiming if the shooter used a silencer.  Even if you use a silencer you can still hear a gun shoot. Especially on a m240. A silencer or flash hider was used to eliminate flash. A flash hider is more common with machine guns. Yes these guns melt silencers but after a  prolonged period of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there are some single shots, but I’m talking about the long pause in shots. I’ve read reports where they found a few of the guns in his room that were jammed. The pause could be from jams and then him switching weapons, or moving around in the room/situating himself. I’m not opposed to the idea of there being more than one shooter, but I think he also used automatic fire. You can hear multiple rounds going off in videos by the Mandalay that sound like an automatic weapon, and what about the +200 rounds he shot at the security guard in the hallway? He apparently hit security guard Jesus Campos in the leg but I find it fishy that this security guard hasn’t been flooded with interviews, and hasn’t even appeared on the internet or TV for all the matter. All we have is his name and that paddock apparently shot him but does this dude even exist? It’s just odd to me that we know nothing about the security guard yet </p>

<p>Did anyone else not see broken glass falling?  Why no pictures of broken glass or hotel video of glass landing on lower roof and ground. Surely glass would scatter on a 320&#39; + fall to the ground and reflect the lights of the strip and be very visible on the way down.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the word &#39;know&#39; is short for &#39;knowledge&#39; - a word that means familiarity with <strong>facts</strong>. And facts are things that are proven to be true through evidence. And evidence is something that is essential to  form a conclusion. You might wanna try that apporach sometime, instead of starting of with the conclusion and then cherrypicking whatever &#39;facts&#39; that will support your conclusion.</p>

I feel like veryone should watch this because it really brings it home, it makes it feel like you were there, and it makes it really feel real, it&#39;s different to when you hear about the number who died or hear about what happened or see videos from a distance, this one really captures what kind of evil these bastards did, firing on completely defenceless people like that. It makes you really understand why it is SO important that we don&#39;t give up with pressing for the truth about what happened, why it&#39;s not enough to let the media drop the story and leave it as a &#39;lone wolf&#39; scenario without answering any of the other questions, because the people who did this and orchestrated it need to be found and exposed. And if there are elements in the government or these elites who stand to profit from this, who see these individual living breathing human ebings as nothing more than cannon fodder for their manipulation and for their personal gain, if they are involved, then people need to know and people need to watch this video and understand what exactly happened and feel the rage at the enormity of the cowardly disgusting evil that happened, and demand answers and demand justice.</p>

almost like watching a footage from a different story  </p>

<p>no way that&#39;s <strong>not</strong> multiple gunmen, or guns firing at the same time from different locations </p>

<p>what is that constant pulsating that is easier to hear after the music stops?  is that gunfire or interference or a pulse or what? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>possibly so. A helicopter being used can explain why people here the same machine gun fire within their resort. Also the change in pitch of the same gun points to it being moved(heli) or the same gun being used in a different location. Also the gun being used is this gun and take note who is shooting it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKbiG6UoJY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKbiG6UoJY</a>  that instagram guy who has been posting vids</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the word &#39;know&#39; is short for &#39;knowledge&#39; - a word that means familiarity with <strong>facts</strong>. And facts are things that are proven to be true through evidence. And evidence is something that is essential to  form a conclusion. You might wanna try that apporach sometime, instead of starting of with the conclusion and then cherrypicking whatever &#39;facts&#39; that will support your conclusion.</p>
