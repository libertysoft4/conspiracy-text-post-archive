<p>We only know what they want us to know. For all we know, let&#39;s just say... it was a deal for Saudi Arabia, but a badddd deal, if you catch my drift ;)</p>

<p>Arms are a business and you&#39;d be pissed if X person promised you A, while Y person <em>gave you the D</em>. Also, terror and chess (grand chessboard). CIA is no friend to America.. </p>

<p>They are the actual terrorists in the world, along with their bastard stepbrothers over in Tel Aviv. Saudis are the runts of the litter, though. But like with all brothers, you can get your older brother(s) to join in a fight. Especially if the target is a mutual enemy.</p>
