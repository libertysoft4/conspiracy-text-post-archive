    <div class="md"><p>Dude filed a tax return in 2015 with a $5 million gross.</p>

<p>Why use semi&#39;s with slide fires? He&#39;d qualify to possess a fully automatic weapon in Nevada as there&#39;s no application or permit required at the state level, so assuming all applicable ATF stamps were paid for he&#39;d be much better equipped to accomplish this &quot;well planned out&quot; attack with fully automatic belt-fed weapons with barrels intended for sustained rates of fire.</p>

<p>You just pop onto this site and lay down some coin and you <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com/item/690528200">get this.</a> Which is apparently $72,500 less than the going rate for a Filipino gal pal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my theory, as well. I posted this on another thread in this sub, but I’ll share it again here:</p>

<p>///</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be much more plausible (short of acknowledging that he was just evil/nuts, especially given recent news re: his night terrors &amp; anxiety disorder/anti-anxiety medication) that old boy held a grudge against LV casino-hotels after losing his 2012-2014 lawsuit against the Cosmopolitan, with prejudice? </p>

<p>Apparently he had only $270 in legal fees left to pay, as of the night of the incident. Maybe all this horrible violence was his scum bag version of a ‘parting gift’ to Las Vegas?</p>

I&#39;m all for &quot;adrenaline makes people do heroic things&quot; but wtf?!?! After hearing all those rounds being fired this guy decides to go looking for the shooter(s). I say shooters because even if there was only 1, at that point the official assumption was there were at least 2 gunmen. And surely Jesus thought there must have been 2, even Law Enforcement was operating under that assumption. So what exactly was he planning on doing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s too obvious. It&#39;s like they want us to go off all over the Internet about this. There have been conspiracies from Operation Northwoods and 9/11, to Project Stargate and MK Ultra. A lot of people would never believe in conspiracies like these, and whenever I see posts on social media I often see them get shot down and dismissed, called crazy etc... however in this case I see a large majority of people believing that the mainstream narrative is a cover up for something much deeper than just 1 crazy man with guns.</p>

<p>I think this not only a push for gun control, but there&#39;s some other motive that has something to do with how people perceive conspiracies. I think there a lot of people who mightve never believed the media would cover up something like this, who might now think otherwise. Everything about this including the physical attributes of the shooter himself, his brothers statements, the sheriff behaviour, the crime scene photos, the footage from people in Vegas showing multiple shooters, it all screams conspiracy.</p>

<p>I just see the majority of people actually believing in the conspiracy theory for once and it&#39;s usually the other way around.</p>

<p>Around the 3 minute mark I believe. Hear three &quot;pops&quot; and then about 10 seconds or so later you start seeing people rushing towards the exits. Then about 5-10 seconds later the 1st volley of shots starts. It&#39;s really strange. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think those are the same shots. The one I posted is before the shooting begins. But this is interesting also. But it&#39;s definitely after people we cleared out of the concert area. It&#39;s also closer to mandalay. The tarp moving could be wind. But very coincidental that it aligns with those gun shots.  </p>

You can&#39;t tell me Campos fucking Neo&#39;d 199 bullets in a hall not much wider than 6&#39; and only got hit by 1 bullet and with the cameras paddock only seeing him get shot once and shoot himself?</p>

It seems very strange that someone does something like this and we have to investigate why it was done at all. While this opens the door to plenty of patsy-type speculation, that&#39;s undercut for me by just how banal this guy seems to have been, he makes a very poor patsy. </p>

It clearly shows a bunch of people running out before the shooting begins. Had to be shooters on the ground somewhere I think. </p>
