You do not use logic, reason or any form of intellect which is why you are incapable of seeing the reality. You are in a Hollywood movie in your head where someone walks onstage amidst flying bullets to calmly say &quot;someone is killing people, please leave cordially&quot; then the stampede hits.

I can&#39;t see any other reason for you to be so enraged haha. I watched the news for about 13 hours straight after it happened. Fox, CNN and MSNBC all reported bullets hitting the artists trailers. The artists themselves also said this. Dan Bilzerians friend who was ON THE STAGE ALSO said the same. You are so fucking retarded it&#39;s actually hilarious to watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  He hesitated, and probably did not know until he saw people falling.  </p>

<p>Either way, there is a procedure to be followed, and he followed it.  By stopping the song and exiting the stage, people knew that something was not right.  It is up to the security personnel to do crowd control.  I bet even they did not realize at first.  The last thing you would expect is someone to be firing down on 22,000 people with a machine gun.  </p>

<p>There is a video of him singing the first song.  There were shots, and he said something to the crowd.  Did you see that video?  </p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not less of a person.  I have been in a random shooting, and it is not what people expect.  It is very different.  </p>

<p>He did what he was supposed to do.  The singer is presumably not trained to do crowd control.  Other people are there for that.  </p>

<p>I will look for that video again.  It was someone standing back from the left side of the stage (left side if you are facing the stage).  There were a few shots before the machine gun fire.  The few shows occurred right before he finished the first song.  The machine gun fire was after he started the second song.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either way, there is no point arguing about it.  I think it is more important to figure out who is responsible.  </p>

<p>There is a single rifle shot as the machine gun is firing at 3:12.  This indicates multiple shooters.  </p>

<p>I just rewatched this video, and you can hear muffled machine fun fire at about 2:00, then you hear much louder machine fun fire on top of it.  This eliminates the echo theory, and makes me think there were two shooters.  </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/mBZMh19_Dws?t=119">https://youtu.be/mBZMh19_Dws?t=119</a></p>

<p>I am not convinced that Paddock was involved.  If he was, he was not the only shooter.  He seems like the perfect dupe to me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you.  I&#39;m being insulting myself to what happened to people there by venting on Aldean.  He didn&#39;t hurt anybody, and it wasn&#39;t his responsibility.  The SNL thing set me off, I apologized to you for anything I may have said that was offensive. </p>

<p>I&#39;m struggling to understand what happened, and why.  I think somebody said if you could actually understand something like this, you&#39;d have to be as fucked up as the person that did it.  It just doesn&#39;t make sense.  Apparently he was planning to get away, and it wouldn&#39;t be incomprehensible to think that somebody that was there with him, might have.  I&#39;m not a conspiracy person, but this one is a damn mystery. </p>

<p>-He apparently didn&#39;t have anything against Mandalay Bay or Country music fans, he had cased other venues with different crowds. </p>

<p>-He didn&#39;t need money, so it wasn&#39;t an extortion thing like with the Beltway sniper (which started out as a plot to murder his ex wife) </p>

<p>-He doesn&#39;t seem to be a domestic or otherwise fanatical terrorist </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries.  I think he was a dupe.  There is a lot more to this story then we are being told.  A huge clue is that there have been no recent videos of him releases, such as in the casino before the attack.  I have not seen any videos of him carrying all of that equipment up, either.

He was running for his life the second he realized what was happening, and he couldn&#39;t have given two fucks what was happening to anybody else.  I&#39;m sure he was at McCarran 10 minutes later headed home to his new wife.</p>

You literally  can&#39;t hear anything but what&#39;s coming through them, so depending on how loud they have them cranked, the only way he could have heard gunshots was if his vocal mic was picking up the sound, and maybe crowd mics (sometimes they put condenser mics on the ends of the stage facing the crowd so the performers can hear a little bit of the crowd noise)<br/>
I don&#39;t think anybody in production would have known what was going on at that moment, much less have a chance to address the crowd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had to reply to this.  You actually think that coward thought through not causing a stampede?  Jesus Christ.  He was running for his life the second he realized what was happening, and he couldn&#39;t have given two fucks what was happening to anybody else.  I&#39;m sure he was at McCarran 10 minutes later headed home to his new wife.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either way, there is no point arguing about it.  I think it is more important to figure out who is responsible.  </p>

<p>There is a single rifle shot as the machine gun is firing at 3:12.  This indicates multiple shooters.  </p>

<p>I just rewatched this video, and you can hear muffled machine fun fire at about 2:00, then you hear much louder machine fun fire on top of it.  This eliminates the echo theory, and makes me think there were two shooters.  </p>

<p>I am not convinced that Paddock was involved.  If he was, he was not the only shooter.  He seems like the perfect dupe to me.  </p>

<p>Your thoughts?  </p>
