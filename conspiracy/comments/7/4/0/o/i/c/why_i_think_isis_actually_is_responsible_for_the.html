        <h3 class="title">Why I think ISIS actually is responsible for the Vegas shooting</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/marknutter.html">marknutter</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve been poring over the details of this shooting since it happened trying to make sense of it and from everything I’ve read and discovered, I think the most plausible explanation so far is that ISIS <em>is</em> in fact responsible for this attack and radicalized Stephen Paddock in order to carry it out. Full disclosure I’m not a big conspiracy theory fan so I don’t entertain any of the standard tropes about false flags, MK Ultra, multiple shooters, divide and conquer, etc. What I’m interested in is the most plausible theory based on past events and the information we know to be true, with a few predictive leaps in judgments based on my own intuition. I could be wildly off base, so please feel free to rip it to shreds.</p>

<p>It has been said that because <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/02/asia/manila-philippines-resort-world-isis/index.html">ISIS claimed to be responsible for the casino attack in the Philippines</a> and that claim was no substantiated, it makes it less likely that their claim of responsibility for the Vegas casino shooting. To me, the similarities between the two actually lends <em>more</em> credence to Isis’ claims than detracts from them.  There’s the connection to the Philippines through Paddock’s GF and the tens of thousands of dollars he supposedly sent there recently, both shooters had a gambling habit, both took place <em>at</em> casinos, and Isis has had success making inroads into the Philippines. It seems completely plausible to me that ISIS would target gambling addicts, fund their habit for a while until they had enough leverage over them to start breaking them down psychologically, and then eventually radicalize them, leading to an attack.</p>

<p>This Paddock guy sounds like a standard washed-up loser. His own brother describes him as “<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/he-just-guy-something-happened-11276148">just a guy</a>”, which is code for “loser”, but also a deflection from any weird behavior he might have been exhibiting. He would <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/las-vegas-shooting/casino-security-video-shows-vegas-shooter-2011-n807016">wear flip flops while he played high stakes poker, and was described as an unkempt slob by the staff</a>. Old white dudes like him go to Southeast Asia in droves looking for young women to trade companionship for a better lifestyle. They’re called “<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farang">farangs</a>” in Thailand and I saw them all over the place when my wife and I honeymooned there.</p>

<p>This guy probably got so in over his head acting like he was some kind of big shot—invoking the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/us/benjamin-paddock-stephen-paddock.html">stories of his notorious bank-robbing daddy</a> to try to seem more interesting than he actually was—that he didn’t realize just how badly he had been manipulated until it was too late (if he even realized it at all).</p>

<p>I mean, think about it—his neighbors said he went on a 6 month trip to the Philippines with his girlfriend, and he comes back and commits the worst mass shooting in US history and does it with type of planning and equipment that one would expect from a coordinated effort rather than a lone-wolf gunman. Before carrying out his attack, he makes sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevineReports/status/914976066774732802">send whatever funds remained in his bank account to his GF</a> (who I’m sure promptly handed it over to her ISIS handlers).</p>

<p>The way his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY4HGmwnyo4">brother was acting when interviewed was really fucking weird</a>, too, and to me it suggests he might’ve known how deep his brother had gotten into this shit and perhaps even started worrying about his own safety. He also seems very concerned about the press taking to their mom. He certainly gives off the vibe of a guy who is holding something back, but because has been living in relative fear, not because he’s in on anything nefarious. His mannerisms are all over the place, like he’s over anxious and can’t keep still. And the way he exasperates over how ordinary his brother was makes it seem like he only knows that some bad shit was going down, but was himself unable to get any info out of his bro, and has been quite frustrated by it.</p>

<p>People keep saying ISIS will claim anything but it’s <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/24/529685951/what-does-it-mean-when-isis-claims-responsibility-for-an-attack">nowhere close to the truth</a>. They didn’t claim the Edmonton attack, nor did they claim the church shooting last week in the US. It doesn’t buy them anything to lie about these attacks, especially when people on the left are so motivated to find any reason to discredit it. Their power comes from their credibility in claiming to have been the root cause of the most horrendous attacks. It’s what helps them recruit and causes their enemies to over estimate their power and influence and run in fear rather than put up a fight. If they’re exposed as liars, their mystique and malevolence is greatly diminished.</p>

<p>It’s also rare for them to reiterate a claim for an attack as they did today. Why are they so motivated to take credit for an attack that seems so easy to dismiss? The potential damage to their reputation seems worse than the potential benefit such a claim would give them. Add to all this the fact that back in May ISIS had <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/las-vegas-shooting-isis-video-famous-strip-already-had-police-high-alert-675199">warned about an imminent attack on Las Vegas</a> and their claim starts to sound pretty credible. </p>

<p>So I think what we have here is another case of a vulnerable Western target of radicalization having carried out an attack on behalf of ISIS, likely lured in by his Filipino girlfriend who was radicalized and being controlled by ISIS as well. Interested to hear other people&#39;s thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See my last comment which I edited before you replied. Also, the guy who posted the clip replied to me in later comments to explain when I asked what I saw. Feel free to ask him. Also, explain your logic, why ISIS would be responsible? That&#39;s the <em>exact</em> flaw in your logic right there. If ISIS is real, why would they claim responsibility for something fake? If their goal is killing infidels, why would they fake something, rather than actually do it?</p>

<p>That attack was used as a reason for some retaliation we made, did our government fake it to be able to retaliate? Did the Iraq government? Idk. But if ISIS got caught claiming responsibility for something fake, it delegitimizes them in a way, that your npr article can&#39;t explain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, sorry, I didn’t see the conversation further down in that thread. Having read that and another conversation linked in that one, I’m not sure why you’re jumping to the conclusion that ISIS claimed that bombing was them, nor do I understand why this supposedly discredits them. It looks weird, that’s for sure, but with no mainstream sources to corroborate that video I’m reticent to believe much of the speculation surrounding it. I mean, wouldn’t you expect this fabrication to have been covered by the media who seems quite adamant in their efforts to discredit ISIS?</p>

<p>I appreciate your feedback either way. I agree that my theory hinges on the credibility of ISIS (or lack thereof), and that I have to make some pretty big leaps in judgement to make my case. I have a question, if I could be candid for a moment; based on your comment history you mention you’re “left-leaning” and appear to be pushing back against right-leaning commenters. I’ve also noticed that people who lean left have been very quick to dismiss any links to ISIS concerning this case, often saying things like “they claim it was them every time someone stubs their toe” or similar quips. I have to wonder—why are people on the left so motivated to deny the possibility that it’s ISIS?</p>

<p>My guess is that if this guy remains a standard gun-toting white male (and wealthy, for good measure), they can continue to push the gun control narrative and distract from the fact that he targeted what were likely conservative people. There might also be a reflexive reaction to ISIS being involved because the narrative suddenly shifts to the threats of radical Islam and tighter immigration controls, especially if it turns out that his Filipino girlfriend was involved in his radicalization. There’s been this uncomfortable tolerance or willingness to ignore ISIS because of the implications of what the solutions to that problem from the right will be (immigration bans, increased military spending, xenophobia, ethnic-nationalism, etc), just like there’s been an uncomfortable tolerance or willingness to ignore white supremacists and Neo Nazis that the right has had because of the implications of what the solution to those problems are from the left (tighter gun controls, more political correctness, further restrictions on speech, etc).</p>

<p>I have leaned left and right over my life (currently right) and try to be fairly critical of both sides, so I may be way off base here. Ultimately I just find this stuff interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try to give a better response in a bit, but this is fitting for showing how hard the right wanted them to be Muslim, and now that they know he&#39;s white, they want it to be ISIS.. because the right is incredibly anti Muslim, while the left I think wants more proof. I think there&#39;s a war of the minds going on, whether it be Russians or other state actors, they want to demonize antifa and Muslims as much as possible. <a href="https://reddit.com/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/7402bj/the_donald_after_learning_the_las_vegas_shooter/">https://reddit.com/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/7402bj/the_donald_after_learning_the_las_vegas_shooter/</a></p>

<p>So why would they attempt to nuke their most frequented subreddit?</p>

<p>Yes, I push back on ideas that shouldn&#39;t be so easily/readily accepted, or seem like they&#39;re being pushed by some sort of agenda. </p>

<p>We really have no idea what the motives are, and we aren&#39;t doing anyone a service if we are fed the lie of ISIS, and half the country wants that to be true so they can be anti Muslim.. if it&#39;s really our government lying to us.</p>

<p>So this seems completely ridiculous to say given the number of white people on the left, but you’re not wrong. For some reason the left has demonized white people as much as the fight has demonized Muslims. Although you and I both know Islam is a religion, not a race, and this Paddock guy being revealed to be a Muslim won’t suddenly make him brown. That’s what so fascinating about this whole thing.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, shouldn’t you be pushing against the idea that ISIS <em>isn’t</em> responsible? Btw, the feds have added the qualifier “at this time” since I submitted this post, and ISIS is now up to an unprecedented <a href="https://twitter.com/rcallimachi/status/914950798802550784">quadrupling-down</a> on their claim (read through her entire twitter thread, btw, because it provides a lot of context from an MSM expert who also adamantly rejects the trope that “ISIS claims everything”). </p>

<p>Also, shouldn’t you push back on the lack of gun regulation being the cause behind this attack too, since that’s also a claim that’s easily/readily accepted by people and obviously quite agenda driven?</p>

<p>As for The_Donald’s about face when the guy was revealed to be white, what were you expecting? The left has had its share of embarrassing moments when attackers they previously believed to have been fodder for their talking points suddenly flipped on them (San Bernadino, Pulse, etc).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, you&#39;re going to have to explain &quot;the left hate white people&quot;, I&#39;ve heard it said so much, but it doesn&#39;t make any sense considering most people on the left are white. I&#39;m white. I don&#39;t hate white people, and honestly I don&#39;t think of people in color.. people are just people. There&#39;s good people and there&#39;s bad people, and honestly color has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>I feel like the idea that anyone hates white people has a lot to do with the idea of privilege, and I think people on the left realize or admit that they have some, while people on the right argue it&#39;s racist or some shit. Some of the most horrific shit I&#39;ve seen the right say came from talking about privilege, and I remember talk of  &quot;hate white people&quot;.</p>

<p>As far as ISIS goes, I&#39;ve never believed in them. It went from Al-Qaeda to ISIS overnight, the former being secretive and hiding.. to a very well organized large group that we somehow didn&#39;t know existed, that was a very large threat.. literally, it came out of nowhere. And I think it&#39;s total bullshit.</p>

<p>At this point, I think it&#39;s just an excuse to kill more Muslims, being able to blame them, while no one on this side of the planet has any idea what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>I mean, I agree, which is why I pointed out the fact that there are plenty of white people on the left. I just think it’s every bit as silly to say the right hates Muslims (and doubly so for the implications that it’s related to race) to say that the left hates white people as it is. Your bias against the right is showing if you think it isn’t.</p>

<p>I feel like the idea that anyone hates white people has a lot to do with the idea of privilege, and I think people on the left realize or admit that they have some, while people on the right argue it&#39;s racist or some shit. Some of the most horrific shit I&#39;ve seen the right say came from talking about privilege, and I remember talk of  &quot;hate white people&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which seems to contradict your claim that you don’t think of people in terms of color. Believing that “white” people have “white privilege” is a prime example of thinking of people in terms of color, isn’t it? </p>

<p>Like, I also claim to not think of things in terms of color, but I remain consistent on that claim even when it hurts me socially. For instance, I reject the concept of “white privilege” specifically because I don’t think of people in terms of color, but that gets me a lot of hate from people in my social groups and community because I live in a very progressive city. But I also reject all the of the crap that the right spews about ethnic minorities being inherently inferior or violent because again, color doesn’t come into it and I (try to) judge everyone at the individual level. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as ISIS goes, I&#39;ve never believed in them. It went from Al-Qaeda to ISIS overnight, the former being secretive and hiding.. to a very well organized large group that we somehow didn&#39;t know existed, that was a very large threat.. literally, it came out of nowhere. And I think it&#39;s total bullshit. At this point, I think it&#39;s just an excuse to kill more Muslims, being able to blame them, while no one on this side of the planet has any idea what&#39;s going on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now <em>this</em> is quite an interesting take, and one that would probably even raise eyebrows among the most left-leaning of people. I’d never even heard the idea that ISIS is made up proposed before; is this a common theory among people on the left? </p>

<p>Frankly (and not to be rude), it sounds like a frantic attempt to distance Muslims from the horrors of ISIS, because ISIS and terrorism certainly throws a wrench in the whole multiculturalism/open-borders/pro-immigration/anti-military agendas from the left. In fact, it’s exactly the same kinda of justifications and hand waving some on the right have used to try to distance itself from white supremacists and neo-nazis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I don&#39;t think in color, and I thought I was being quite clear when I was explaining what I&#39;ve seen <em>the right talk about</em>, and these are people I&#39;ve had to engage with in college and other forums such as this. On a typical day in my life, the issue of color never comes up, unless I have to deal with someone who makes it an issue.</p>

<p>I would be much more agreeable with people who identified as being on the right, if I saw more of them call out the people who do refer to people of other races as inferior. As a matter of a fact, I&#39;ve been talking with the guy who posted the Donald before/after thing, and I completely respect that he&#39;s calling them out on their bullshit, he even got banned for it. I just wish you guys would organize, because to most people, the right seems to have damn near radicalized, and there&#39;s no social pressure on them to be more rational. Show us there&#39;s more than just your average Trump supporter.</p>

<p>As far as ISIS is concerned, I doubt that has to do with a political ideology. But I was bothered when there&#39;s this group that suddenly popped into existence, replacing our old enemy with one that apparently uses social media. I was bothered that they can create a replacement enemy out of thin air, one which is harder to identify as it&#39;s purely based on radicalizing someone.</p>

<p>I think another thing that doesn&#39;t get talked about, is this war is nothing new. It&#39;s been a fight between Christians and Muslims since long before the crusades. This is just a modernized version that continues the exact same thing. One side killing the other, because the other side is wrong.</p>

<p>Also, I think the right, or more specifically places like the Donald, are going to be the biggest cause of radicalized Muslims. Because when you start saying any Muslim is a &quot;insert hateful rhetoric&quot;, you&#39;re only increasing the chance that they will. How much hate can you take aimed at you before you strike back?</p>

<p>The idea is that there&#39;s a conflict between two extremist ideologies, and I think the people here really demonstrate exactly how that happened <a href="https://reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/73zvpd/when_top_minds_are_not_sure_yet/dnuemhh?context=3">https://reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/73zvpd/when_top_minds_are_not_sure_yet/dnuemhh?context=3</a></p>

<p>FWIW I push back against that crap, too, although all of my friends and acquaintances for the most part are left-leaning so there’s not much to push back against. I was liberal for most of my life until become more libertarian in recent years and now somewhat conservative on certain issues, so being on the right is completely new territory for me. I suppose I’m more critical of the left because I still identify with people on the left and perhaps am able to notice their flaws more than people who’ve only ever been on that side can, having exhibited them all myself at one time or another. I spent so many years railing at the right I no longer find it interesting to do so, plus like I said, I’m surrounded by people who do enough of that already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I consider myself left leaning, based primarily on a few views that align that way.. tho I&#39;ve been accused of having overly conservative views by the true left. Almost every person I know that leans left wouldn&#39;t fit the criteria of what the right thinks they want/believe.</p>

<p>I think what is primarily happening, is the far left and the far right are the most vocal.. while I go on Twitter and never see the types of examples that I see people in the Donald post about liberals (freaky looking people with a sign saying something ridiculous on Twitter).. they must exist, but that definitely doesn&#39;t represent liberals. Not the majority at least.</p>

<p>And places like r/t_d likely doesn&#39;t represent most conservatives, but then there&#39;s no way to tell the difference most of the time. </p>

<p>Both sides appear like brainwashed people who are out of touch with reality.. and this being r/conspiracy, I think there&#39;s likely agents of foreign powers that are helping to divide us by adding to it.. hell, it could be straight fueled by it.</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m saying is I&#39;m glad we seem to have come to similar ground, despite the efforts of those who wouldn&#39;t want that.</p>

Namely, the fact that he wasn’t an ethnic minority means the left and right doesn’t have to bicker over immigration and racism, and the fact that he was an average American guy but roped in by a poisonous ideology might cause people to stop and reflect on their own ideologies and realize it’s the <em>ideas</em> that must be fought against, rather than the people who espouse them. </p>

<p>If he ends up being a left or right wing radical, however, it will be absolutely devastating. As terrible as the ISIS explanation is, I far prefer it to one that further pits American against American.</p>

I’m not the one describing him as a loser, the staff and others that he interacted with at the casinos he frequented described him as an unkempt slob who would shuffle around in flip flops. He even tried extorting 100k out of the Casino because he supposedly slipped and injured himself. It’s completely possible for him to have all those properties and still be deeply in debt due to his gambling addiction. You are basing whether or not he’s a loser purely on the amount of money he supposedly has, but money doesn’t automatically make someone a “winner”. The dude is an old, butt-ass-ugly white dude who’s past his prime, hasn’t got any kids that visit him or a wife to keep him company, and has what appears to be a serious gambling addiction. I’ve known people like this and it’s not a pretty sight. No amount of money can make up for the ravages of old age and the loneliness of a childless, spouseless life. </p>

<p>On the one hand, like Omar Mateen in Orlando, these other attacks have undeniable links to ISIS that Law Vegas hasn&#39;t provided.  However, they do show that the terrorist group is inspiring attacks worldwide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s the weird thing... ISIS claimed neither of those two other attacks. According to the standard narrative, ISIS will claim a stubbed toe, yet here are two attacks obviously inspired by them and not a peep. My take on it is that ISIS has very specific types of attacks that it wants carried out, and those are the ones they get involved in. What they want to do is show that it’s not about immigration, or refugees, or open borders, or background checks, or troubled second generation immigrants, or any of the standard problems that people think once addressed will fix the terrorism problem. They want to show the word that they can radicalize anyone, and that our attempts to try to prevent it by recognizing a pattern and putting a plan in action to prevent it is futile. That’s the whole <em>point</em> of terrorism—to make us feel completely helpless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t this start off on the arguable assumption that &#39;ISIS&#39; is actually an entity and not a completely fabricated &#39;coherent group&#39;, much like Al-Qaeda were claimed to be back in the day.</p>

<p>I agree its extremely convenient that the chaps girlfriend was from the Philippines, and then lends credence to the idea, but remember ISIS were non existent in the Philippines until people were pushing back on Duterte&#39;s &#39;anti-drug&#39; regime. Now he gets a pass &#39;cuz Isis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FBI said that when Isis claim responsibility they almost always have  some kind of loose ties to an attack.  I definitely think they would claim a attack that they didn&#39;t have anything to do with. On the other hand if they claim every attack and and are found to be liars no one is going to join them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing they are saying about the shooter makes sense. The online info on him is non existent but for a few weird pictures. There&#39;s a linkedin account with a different person pictured but the same address they said they found more guns and the age matches. That&#39;s very fishy for such a well to do business man with all they claim he had. </p>

<p>Most importantly there are several videos that confirm there were multiple shooters. Even the people running for their lives say the shots were coming from different directions and had different sounds. If you study ballistics there&#39;s no way all of the shots could have come from the angle of just that high room 1100 yds away. I think it was an arms deal gone bad. Half the guns could have walked out the door. I think he was undercover or coordinating the meeting. I&#39;m not even convinced he fired a shot at all. It&#39;s awful and the worst part is the multiple people who did this are walking free right now.  </p>
