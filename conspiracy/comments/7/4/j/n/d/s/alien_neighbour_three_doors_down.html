    <div class="md"><p>No animals no . I’ve tried creeping near his window after I saw the lights . He had very loud. Music on ( normal music ) . When he finally left the house two weeks ago he drove off fast , very fast . I then went over to his place and quickly opened his letter box flap, I couldn’t see anything but there was a kitchen light on . I couldn’t get a picture as it was mainly carpet I saw and some coats ( or gowns ) I just worry as these lights were like some sort of fireworks but not if that makes sense . He’s a strange creature would it be possible that someone come come to earth pretend to be human and then connecting with the mothership ? It’s gotta be </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tbh I already have . Only twice though that was after he sped past me very fast and flashed his car lights at me three times . No need for it at all. But that was after I posted the note so I kinda let it go , however I checked the bins as if he’s putting meat out in the street his knows what else he may have stored . I found nothing incriminating in the bin </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for reply I’ve heard of sad lights as I’ve suffered myself with bouts of depression . These were like strobe lighting , almost flares but indoors ? Do these lights come with smoke three times I’ve seen the lights with the smoke it’s not fag smoke </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm, I do not think they SAD lights have a strobe effect or smoke.  That is certainly bizarre.   Maybe he likes having a party of one and has a smoke machine and strobe likes for a more natural party vibe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m gonna look more into this thank you . What about the speeding out of a cul de sac ? That’s not something someone from our planet would do , or flashing me , then the noises in the garden , leaving meat out , skipping past dogs , staring at me through my window , he hissed at my husband this is not signs of depression though ? It’s just frustrating. I want to live in harmony </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sent him a message on Facebook saying something to the affect of ‘ hi it’s me number .... I just wanted to try and build some bridges with you , after you clearly spied on me and then drew your curtains and the dog waste incident I would really like to talk things over clear the air  ‘ he replied something to the effect of ‘ I know nothing about any dog waste , I heard from a reliable source you was in my bins and have been poking through my letter box ‘ 
then he blocked me !!!! How can we build a relationship if he does that ? . Also who is his source ? No one talks to him apart from his equally strange gentleman friend . That’s what’s baffling me </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol deffo not a murderer . I understand it looks like that when u read it but this is nothing there’s been a whole list of things that have occurred that lead me to suspect something is off . A month back he had some kind of experience in the garden . Lots of shouting and weird noises , Then his only friend I’ve ever seen ( another man ) went inside and the noises stopped but the lights started again and so did some smoke coming out of the windows . I’ve started to keep a diary of events , I want evidence . I sat there for two hours that night watching the smoke and the lights , all the time thinking I should knock and speak to him </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I wish !!! No I couldn’t and then I’d lower myself to him . If I did that he will start hissing at my husband again . I’m trying not to cause s confrontation too much . He screamed at my hubby saying he’s been overtaken then hissed again till I cane outside I saw it all from the kitchen window, I tried to throw a slipper at him ( I should not have done that I’m not proud ). Then my husband shouted at me to get inside . Whilst I threw the slipper ( which didn’t hit the alien hybrid ) conscientiouly anyway , the alien neighbour just laughed . I mean who laughs when they have someone throwing something </p>
