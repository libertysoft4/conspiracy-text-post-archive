        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">895</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ImJustAPatsy.html">ImJustAPatsy</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So the story is SWAT breached the main double door to 32-135 after 72 minutes and moved into the suite to find the suspect DOA from a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head.  They then swept the room and were unable to gain access to the other door, so shortly after performed a second breach from INSIDE 32-135 to gain access to the second adjoining  room 32-134, which Paddock has also rented to search for an additional shooter.  </p>

<p>Here is my issue.  Those adjoining room options always have two doors, one that locks from each side in case there is a different guest staying in them.  Why would SWAT say they needed to explosive breach the second door because they couldnt gain access to that room?  That would mean it was locked from the inside, which would be impossible for Paddock, being he was down in the main suite.  There was a second broken window, and shots fired, from that second suite so how was it locked from the inside?</p>

<p>EDIT: floorplan layout of the vista suite shows at least one adjoining door opens INWARD to 32135 at minimum.  That further indicates there was no way for the shooter to lock the door to the next room. <a href="http://www.lasvegas.net/UserFiles/Image/mandalaybayvistasuitefloorplan_644.gif">http://www.lasvegas.net/UserFiles/Image/mandalaybayvistasuitefloorplan_644.gif</a>  </p>

<p>EDIT 2:  Here is a video, showing connecting rooms in the Mandalay Bay.  Shows there are 2 doors, one opening into each room, that DEADBOLTS FROM THE INSIDE of that room.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXDxqLQIkcs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXDxqLQIkcs</a></p>

<p>EDIT 3: here is a floorplan showing the second broken window and shot location was indeed behind the ajoining room, 32135 and not both in the main suite area:  <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/02/us/mandalay-bay-vegas-shooting-1506946492937/mandalay-bay-vegas-shooting-1506946492937-facebookJumbo-v18.jpg">https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/02/us/mandalay-bay-vegas-shooting-1506946492937/mandalay-bay-vegas-shooting-1506946492937-facebookJumbo-v18.jpg</a></p>

<p>EDIT 4:  whats the deal with the guest claiming he was staying in 32-134, the same room which had a broken window and shots fired that adjoined the main suite?  Is this just bad tabloid reporting and the guy was mistaken about his room number? <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/vegas-shooting-stephen-paddock-gunman-hotel-mandalay-bay-man-staying-next-door-a7978696.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/vegas-shooting-stephen-paddock-gunman-hotel-mandalay-bay-man-staying-next-door-a7978696.html</a></p>

<p>EDIT 5: quotes from police scanner after the first breach &quot;control, zebra-20.  we are clearing this room, we have one suspect down.&quot;  Then several minutes later,  &quot;zebra-20, we have an explosive breach going off into an adjoining room, thats where we are in the suite.  The breach is going off in about 5 seconds.&quot; Shortly later, &quot;control, zebra-20.  We&#39;ve got the eastern room secure, we&#39;ve got one suspect down, multiple firearms, this is definitely the location they were firing into the crowd.&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT 6: VERY INTERESTING TIDBIT AT THE END OF THE VIDEO: The official story is none of the SWAT officers fired during hte breach and sweep of the room, but zebra-20 reports otherwise &quot;We don&#39;t need anybody else up on this floor, break.  This floor is clear, it has cleared by swat team with two breaches, we did have one SWAT officer that did fire, we have negative injuries on anybody else.  We have multiple firearms up here, from where they were shooting out of, but we just have one suspect down at this time.&quot;  He then gets called over to the SWAT 1 channel, to get him off the public channel.  Thats the last we hear of zebra-20.  Time linked video below.

<p>Also a common tactic these days is downvoting top level comment where further down is a good discussion. Happens a lot on the news and world news boards where the only deep discussion is further down on a collapsed comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about this as well. My thoughts are that there were two shooters. One at each window. Stephens accomplice shoots him in the back and makes it look like a self inflicted wound. Can someone show the floor plan photo and where Stephen was found laying? Is the adjoining room to the right of him or left of him? If it&#39;s to the right then the second shooter definitely shot him in the back. </p>

<p>Second shooter goes into second room and locks the door and escapes. Furthermore conspiracy...he escapes thru the window and that&#39;s why after the shots, the kids in that video saw glass falling from the street level outside of Mandalay Bay. The shooter goes to the Four Seasons above the 32nd floor (which is claimed to be owned by the Saudi.) </p>

<p>These are my speculations. Hope someone has thought this too... </p>

<p>the two shooters go to town on the crowd. after the two shooters are finished they grab Paddock off the bed and hold the revolver in his mouth and pull the trigger.</p>

<p>Paddock is laid on the ground as if he had killed himself.</p>

<p>The two shooters exit into the adjoining room and lock the door as they leave.</p>

<p>The police breach the room Paddock is laying dead in but they can&#39;t go into the next room because it&#39;s locked from the other side. </p>

<p>The shooters escape while the Police fumble with entry.</p>

<p>I personally believe that we will NEVER be shown the footage of Paddock entering the casino. I bet he was smuggled in under duress or already unconscious.</p>

<p>This is my theory and prediction of the situation with regard to surveillance footage of Paddock. We will never be shown these images or video footage because it does not exist. None of it.</p>

He very well could have started in the smaller room, then decided the suite was a better angle, went out the main door leaving the adjoining door locked to provide him extra safety, and entered the main suite and continued shooting from there.  There was a lot of down time between the bursts of shots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those doors don&#39;t have handles on both sides of the door... to protect the privacy of guests. It&#39;s possible, as someone else stated, he let the door close behind him and without a handle, it couldn&#39;t be opened from that suite. Which would require a door (either the from or adjoining one) to be breached. </p>

<p>Source: I&#39;ve stayed in hotels. And, in your YouTube clip, you can see the door doesn&#39;t have a handle on the inside of the door. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes I wasn&#39;t thinking about the main handle latching, in my head I was focusing on the locking aspect.  Pulling the door closed behind you wouldn&#39;t technically &quot;lock&quot; it but you would just have no way of opening the handle latch.  Still seems strange for him to have pulled the door shut behind him, knowing he would have no way of returning to that room due to the security guard in the hallway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, those doors are relatively heavy, and sometimes even come with doorstops. </p>

<p>If this is as planned as the official narrative suggests, he&#39;d have the doors propped open. And there&#39;s no way, if he&#39;s going back and forth, he can even &quot;accidentally&quot; shut the door. </p>

<p>Good thought process on this. Hopefully, one of the videos he recorded will shed some light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it really just was him, I don&#39;t understand why he would ever intentionally close the doors between suites.  I just stayed in a hotel where we had the adjoining room and there was no automatic latch or whatever, you had to lock the door from the room you were in.  Its possible this hotel&#39;s adjoining rooms do have latches that close/lock automatically just from closing the door, so a cross breeze could potentially then cause the doors to be closed.  But if this isn&#39;t the case, then I do not see any plausible reason to explain how he locked the door and went to the other suite to then kill himself.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really see any other way out for him.

<p>So the two broken windows were in separate rooms? Meaning this ‘second shooter’ theory is possible and that he got away via room 2’s main door.  Don’t most hotels keep a log of when a door is open and closed?</p>

<p>The other possible occurrence could be, that the ‘unknown shooter’ could have been the one to shoot Paddock prior to the shooting occurring and prior to the windows being broken. This might explain the reason for the rifle being on top of Paddocks left leg in the crime scene pictures as well as the lack of strength in terms of breaking the 800 lb windows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I know it&#39;s a stretch ha, but you are assuming that guests/security guard we&#39;re just standing in the hall for long periods of time. This could be one his reasoning for the camera set up? Also, he may have started from 134, then moved to 135 once his ammo ran out there?

Each of those rooms had a broken window and firing position, and there was a set of two doors (two sandwiched singular doors, not a set of double doors) that both need to be opened from their respective sides to make the two rooms accessible to each other without going into the hallway.  Those doors are secured on each side by a deadbolt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, two rooms were rented/booked/comped (however you wanna put it) in his name. </p>

<p>Each room has a door that has a deadbolt accessible only to the individual in said room. The door is opened by pulling toward you. Additionally each room has its own main door accessible only by key card. </p>

<p>So, yes, in order for Paddock to lock the door: he would have had to close and lock the door and then proceed outside of the room and then back into the room where he was found in. This would not prove to be a smart decision on his behalf because, as you said, it would expose him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone seems very certain that there were two doors. I believe we’re not being told everything, but every graphic of the hotel room layout does not show enough room to have two doors. Most of these hotel suite link doors are on a master key that a hotel employee unlocks if one party rents multiple rooms. Probably 4 out of 5 hotels I’ve stayed at have had 1 door between these rooms, either locked or unlocked depending on whether the party books both connected rooms or not. I have a big family who often rents out large potions of a hotel for reunions and similar family trips. It’s very possible there was just one door and people are assuming/extrapolating to believe there were multiple shooters based on their experience with specific hotels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, we know the suite door was ajar. We know the stairway was barricaded preventing it to be opened from the hallway (correct me if im wrong and it couldnt be opened from the stair well and was barricaded from the hallway side). There is also 15 min window you say the doors were unwatched. With that said (depending which side of stair door was barricaded) it is possible the accomplice was watching hallway, unloaded on the security guard. Security guard ran and then accomplice ran out the door, abandoning Paddock in the room alone. Accomplice heads into stairwell, barricades it to prevent Paddock from escaping, accomplice heads up stairs to 4 seasons room and waits it out. Paddock realizes hes been double crossed when he goes to the stairwell and door is barricaded and goes back to room, decides he is the patsy and will be taken into custody and writes the note and kills himself. Or accomplice shot Paddock prior to entering staircase. Seems plausible either way. Dunno</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good theory. I have thoughts very similar. But then I think about the hotel security cameras. I mean Vegas casinos have some of the best cameras! And the sheriff said he was going up all floors with the swat team or police and only got away from them for around 60 seconds when he got shot. So how could he have done this? So maybe he killed paddock and then went down stairs to play out the info we have received so far. Maybe he was super smart and rigged the cameras looking down the hall way from the suite for his escape plan (he did after all have access to them since hes a security guard). But it all comes down to seeing the cameras from the hotel to decide if he had anything to do with it or not. I&#39;m hoping they release those.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think a door exploding would still shock someone. Idk tho never seen one happen irl. If i was stephen and I knew a swat team was en route; I&#39;d stop shooting. Go find a nice lil spot in the room to lie down, soon as that door opens I&#39;m popping swat. Bet atleast one of em drops and the rest of them think twice about entering that room. Now I&#39;ve shot and possibly killed 1 maybe more. Im guessing they&#39;ve got to go with a minimum risk to officers in a situation. Although if that&#39;s the case, why not just flash bang the room</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is still the source of a lot of heartburn for me. SWAT says they&#39;re using an explosive breach and you hear it over the radio. Then if you look at the crime scene picture of the door on it&#39;s side it seems very obvious that an explosive breach was not in fact used. Not only that, there doesn&#39;t appear to be anywhere near 200 rounds put through the door. Plus the overall security guard situation seems suspicious. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/glimpse-inside-las-vegas-shooters-hotel-room/story?id=50255988">http://abcnews.go.com/US/glimpse-inside-las-vegas-shooters-hotel-room/story?id=50255988</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for putting all of this together!</p>

<p>I have maintained there would be no reason at all to knock out multiple windows with a single shooter. He would likely have all the guns/ammunition on the bed behind him for easy access. Not run to an entirely different room for a worse vantage-point. </p>

<p>Also the need for security cameras if he had a handgun with the intent of suicide doesn’t add up. If he wanted to die they would have 10000% shot him upon entrance anyway so he wouldn’t have gone through the trouble. </p>

<p>The locked doors is an extremely big issue with me. There had to be another person involved to accomplish that. </p>

I bet pol could figure it out:</p>

<p>If fbi wants to dispel the notion of him being a gun runner :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>look into the guest logs as far back as possible of every time Steve stayed at a casino</p></li>
<li><p>Verify those datess with video evidence and employee testimonials that he was always gambling - if he really was a high roller and he was well known enough to receive comps then it sod be easy to find employees, management and check in clerks that recognize him</p></li>
<li><p>Release footage from his last stay and his previous stays, footage that only shows him and him alone or maybe with his gf entering and exiting the room.
Not any Isis or antifa or terrorist types... </p></li>
<li><p>Show us what&#39;s on the note</p></li>
<li><p>Show us video footage of the night of shooting especially right before when a potential client couldve entered and when and where and how the police carried out the breach during the shooting as well as after to dispel the notion of additional bodies being removed so we can corroborate with police scanner.</p></li>
<li><p>Release this info NOW or ASAP so people can&#39;t claim that the footage was edited (removed, refilmed) and so that the employees, management, check in clerks, bag boys, bar tenders even the casino owner or higher ups don&#39;t have time to be pressures into lying or collaborating to fit the gambling narrative
I mean is that really too much to ask?</p></li>

<p>If I was the shooter and I knew 2 adjoining rooms were connected by the doors (like you pointed out). I would reserve/book both rooms for the shooters &quot;safety.&quot; On a busy weekend like that AND a plan to heinously murder innocent people I wouldn&#39;t want to take the risk that there&#39;s John McClane (fictional badass cop) on vacation in the next room that could potentially stop you once you started. Basically, you wouldn&#39;t want to take a risk of having a hero next door once you started your &quot;business.&quot; </p>

<p>Bottom line: he did it for his own safety to make sure no one would interrupt him. He wouldn&#39;t have to check the room before starting because he knew no one would be in there because he have the key and he booked it. </p>

<p>How to we know which is the &quot;second door&quot;?</p>

<p>I just think there might be a difference between &quot;can&#39;t access the second door, and their training, which would not involve walking up to a second door and jiggling the handle.</p>

<p>SWAT has a protocol, and it normally does not involve anything to do with a door, much less trying the handle.</p>

<p>They place a charge, and blow it.  Stack 5+ bodies behind the blow to enter and take advantage of the momentary shock any occupants would experience.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, there&#39;s no indication that the door was locked or couldn&#39;t be accessed. OP seems to be making the assumption that it was solely because they used an explosive breach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to point out that hotels especially large casino hotels track literally everything.  </p>

<p>The hotel can very easily run a lock audit on that lock  of the 2nd room to see who if anyone and when has accessed that room.  They can then look at the change history of the reservation attached to that room to see keys made, keys swapped, key added etc.   could also use in conjunction with simple camera watching.  Basically what I&#39;m saying is that hotel can figure out the second room question if they wish to or are forced to by fed.   </p>

<p>As the wind flows around the outside of the building you can have large pressure differentials between the two window locations.  Even a heavy door could be slammed shut but that airflow.  It doesn&#39;t take much pressure working on a large surface like a door to move it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup, thats the one I&#39;m referencing.  It sounded pretty loud to be an interior room pistol shot 32 floors up.  My guess is those were single shots from a 308 rifle pointed out of the window at the gas tanks.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the adjoining bedroom (32-134) had a door to the hallway. on some of the leaked photos you can see a room service cart in front of that door and also the room number. i assume that this bedroom might be an optional room that you might book as an extra feature to your suite (e.g. for a large family). this would justify a connecting door with key card reader (will unlock only if guest has booked that extra feature). </p>

<p>i am just assuming, i have no proof for this. in the videos where guests of room 32-135 walk through their suite, unfortunately that adjoining door is never in full sight. and it is also never opened. </p>

I&#39;m pretty sure half that door would be gone at the least if you shot through it 200 freakin times.

If you cant see his dead body laying on the ground from the doorway why not send in a drone or a robot or a freaking  dog. It&#39;s hard for me to believe that they waited around for an hour putting innocent lives and first responders in danger and costing people there lives potentially. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes more sense? A strike team throwing a flash bang or 3 and storming the room with 5 or 6 or 12 highly trained officers or waiting an hour or so to stop a guy that killed 58 people in 10 minutes from in elevated position that couldn&#39;t be seen from the ground. 
The only reason they didn&#39;t storm that room was because they knew he was already dead imo. 
What kind of damage would 200 rounds do to that door and the rest of the hotel i mean would it have been a bigger mess outside the door would windows down the hall be shot out? Unless there is another hallway to take people down u can&#39;t have anyone going down that hall where his line of sight is. 
This room being next to a stairwell is no coincidence either. Hopefully someone can answer this one why have swat walk 32 flights of stairs and not take the elevator to 31st or 33rd floor?
Also wouldn&#39;t where the guard got shot have some evidence markers around it. I&#39;d like to see where he was to have escaped from 199 bullets. I&#39;m picturing neo between when he realized he could dodge bullets and then  after getting hit realizing there is no spoon. Also remarkably all 200 shots came from the double door on the left. The right door has no bullet holes. And who&#39;s watching him on the baby monitor? </p>

<p>Before he started his rampage, he broke the window of the second smaller room either with a hammer or shot it out. Then he deadlocked the &quot;internal door&quot; and exited through the hallway and back to his main suite?</p>

<p>Afterwards he shot out/broke the second window and starred shooting at 10:05pm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has there been much info on direction of gunfire when the security guard approached the ajar&#39;d door? </p>

<p>Another possibility is that he was freely moving between both rooms. When the guard approached, he deadlocked from inside the second room and started firing from there? Then he retreated into the main suite?</p>

<p>The above would definitely take some CQC training but it&#39;s definitely possible to pull off. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just trying to figure out how that door was deadlocked/deadbolted from the inside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. This guy was a messy/novice shooter. I haven&#39;t seen all the leaked pics, but from what I&#39;ve actually seen... all his rifles were long barrels. You need short barrel in order to conduct effective cqc.</p>

<p>Second part of why I think he was a novice is the guard. He had cover, concealmeant and a rifle. Yet after 200+ rounds he was unable to hit the guy? I mean, I&#39;m GLAD the guard survived but this just screams little to no training  to me.</p>

<p>So after all of this, why was the second room deadbolted from the inside? Hmm. I&#39;m thinking the main suite door was ajar because his accomplice shot him and booked it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he broke the separate bedroom window first. The reason is that in the leaked photo of the main room you can see a yellow hammer near his body, which I assume is what he used to break the windows. If he broke the main room window first, then the separate bedroom window, why carry the hammer back to the main room?</p>

<p>If he exited the separate bedroom into the hallway, why then move the food cart in front of that door before proceeding back into the suite through the main door? I think he set up the food cart before he started shooting, doubt he was in the hallway moving it around afterward.</p>

<p>The part that&#39;s most confusing to me is it looks like he intentionally blocked that door with the cart, so why not barricade the main suite door as well? Unless his escape plan involved leaving through that door. The whole thing is bizarre. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>32-134 probably looks ajar from another angle. It&#39;s possible the wire didn&#39;t fit. Would there really be an upside to leaving that door slightly open on purpose? I bet there is a mixup in the media about the room actually being 2 rooms with different numbers. There seems to be generalities about approaching the shooter&#39;s room because the door is ajar, but we actually know now the room he was found in is 32-135 and that camera goes into 32-134.</p>

that is indeed reasonably fast, uncannily fast actually, if you ever tried navigating a casino before...  </p>

<p>Why would SWAT say they needed to explosive breach the second door because they couldnt gain access to that room? That would mean it was locked from the inside, which would be impossible for Paddock, being he was down in the main suite. There was a second broken window, and shots fired, from that second suite so how was it locked from the inside?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally, Paddock goes into the room, locks the room adjoining door. Leaves from the main room door into hallway into the main suite. Probably locks the door from his side too, to make breaching from there just a tiny bit harder.</p>

<p>How is this even a question?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This image begs to differ (with the official story)...</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all seen these images countless times. Many have used them to scrutinize the rooms for flashes and yet...nobody seems to have SEEN the obvious smoking gun evidence showing the story is a lie, followed by clear staging...</p>

<p>Look. Don&#39;t just look but SEE....BEFORE the staging for the public photos...</p>

<p>What do you see?</p>

<p><a href="https://s17.postimg.org/sojsd7qdr/Glass2.jpg">https://s17.postimg.org/sojsd7qdr/Glass2.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href="https://s17.postimg.org/euvfo4827/Glass3.jpg">https://s17.postimg.org/euvfo4827/Glass3.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href="https://s17.postimg.org/4kt0oxncf/Glass6.jpg">https://s17.postimg.org/4kt0oxncf/Glass6.jpg</a></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>These are double paned windows. That means one pane on the interior of the room and one on the facade. The exterior window has been busted out but the interior window has not. Yes, that is glass. You can follow the sharp straight, broken edges top to bottom. That is the interior window still mostly intact except for a small broken gap where the curtain is being sucked into the vacuum. The rest of it is pulling against the glass in the way.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In pretty much every single photo taken of the building to show the broken windows as of the morning of October 2nd (feel free to pull up the msm articles and see for yourself), you see the same couple of images:</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://s17.postimg.org/p3nwttti7/News1.png">https://s17.postimg.org/p3nwttti7/News1.png</a> as one example</p>

<p><a href="https://s13.postimg.org/gzwnbglx3/staged2.jpg">https://s13.postimg.org/gzwnbglx3/staged2.jpg</a></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>So, between the ones shown above, and the ones hitting the papers for October 2nd, someone has gone in there and busted out the interior window to a bigger opening and we see the whole curtain being pulled through or billowing out. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Let me remind you what is on the other side of this window:</p>

<p><a href="https://s13.postimg.org/6sipczc9z/vegas_shooting_hotel_5.jpg">https://s13.postimg.org/6sipczc9z/vegas_shooting_hotel_5.jpg</a></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Does that really look like it would accommodate all the machine guns held or positioned in that cranny between the column and the window? Look closer at the curtain...why is it billowing inward if the entire windows were busted out? </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>And after more staging:</p>

<p><a href="https://s17.postimg.org/pt6p6awnj/Staged.jpg">https://s17.postimg.org/pt6p6awnj/Staged.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href="https://s17.postimg.org/5yknk7cb3/Staged7.jpg">https://s17.postimg.org/5yknk7cb3/Staged7.jpg</a></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>It goes on - but the gist of it is that the rest of the window was pulled out of the way for the &quot;official&quot; images. </p>

<p>Also, where&#39;s the other chair? We know there are two on either side of the little table yet in the body image there&#39;s just the one and the staged images there&#39;s just the one. Even being able to partially see through the windows there&#39;s just the one. Probably never know but it&#39;s interesting all the same.</p>

<p><a href="https://s13.postimg.org/6sipd19pz/Staging1.jpg">https://s13.postimg.org/6sipd19pz/Staging1.jpg</a></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>If he was dead before 1am and the first photos managed to capture the almost full interior pane window still intact and a little broken area closest to that column in the room, and for the official AP images dealt to the media it&#39;s all busted out and spacious, then the only explanation is the scene was staged, tampered with, and the official story of rm 135 being a sniper room is a lie.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>One last question: would you be willing to stick your head below these jagged pieces for a shooting spree or would you be likely to get rid of any sharp hulking piece of glass that would be above your head before you started firing out the space? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he rented both rooms he’d probably had a key to both rooms (the suite and the adjoining room). So he could have just used the exit doors to the hallway for both the suite and the regular room in order to access them. He may have kept the middle connecting door locked and just used the regular entrances. Idk I’m a little confused as to the whole explanation of this and what the official report is on how it went down, but I don’t really see anything super suspicious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally get what you mean and I’m not disagreeing with you that it’s unlikely, but he did have machine rifles to protect himself w which he did use on one of the security people, and I’m sure he knew he wouldn’t have an issue with any guests or these personnel in the short term cause, well he had a ton of guns and he clearly wasn’t afraid to use them. either way once the police got in the building he probably knew he was going to be fucked no matter what door He was going to use. regardless, I’m just mostly saying that it’s a possibility this was the case. Your post sort of made it seem like because of the lock, this was some sort of setup/scenario  that couldn’t have occurred the way it has been presented, that’s all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I&#39;m curious about is the baby monitor the chief said he had set up in the &quot;living area&quot; of the room. The way he worded it made it sound like the baby monitor camera was a separate system from the other 3 cameras (1 on peephole and 2 on food cart).</p>

<p>Looking at the diagram of the room, there would be no reason to aim the baby monitor camera at the bedroom or bar area. There would also be no reason to aim it at the main entrance door since he already had 3 cameras covering that area. It makes me wonder if he had a handler watching him on the baby monitor. </p>

<p>Maybe the handler was in the separate bedroom behind the closed door? That could also explain why the diagram shows no weapons were found in the separate bedroom. If Paddock was running back and forth between the two rooms why wouldn&#39;t he split the guns up between each room?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy is fake. He says he heard the gunman in the next room and then went down to hide in the bushes and &quot;nobody knew where the shots were coming from&quot;. This is classic MSM &quot;diversion&quot; story with keywords to help hide the real searchable terms like the room next door. They did a similar story with the security Guard story to dillute the search. Instead of a dead Security Guard or bloody guard being chased, now it&#39;s a guy who is a &quot;hero&quot; and was just shot in the leg. Bah!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watched a video of a SWAT breach. Those things do some serious damage, more than I wouldve expected. Judging by the floorplan and what the crime scene photos show, why is there no evidence of a breach blast in the room? I imagine Paddocks body wasnt far from the right window which would mean the crime scene photos would be showing portions of the rest of the suite which was on the opposite side of the breached door. Why do the photos show the room to be perfectly in tact?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question (not sure if this is right place for it)....</p>

<p>I was thinking, while listening to the scanner feed, how do they get people in nearby rooms out? Obviously, the guy next door (or wherever he was) was alerted by the other woman. But, they had to clear every room on that floor, whether they were occupied or not (they didn&#39;t know). At that point, he had stopped firing, so they couldn&#39;t just knock on doors. And, if they didn&#39;t know FOR SURE what room he was in (or an accomplice), they wouldn&#39;t just use a key because what if someone ended up shooting at them? They didn&#39;t blow up each door. </p>

<p>So...how do they get the surrounding guests (even 2-4 rooms down) out? WOULD they? What if there was an accomplice in one of the rooms? Searching the room wouldn&#39;t do much good if they had no evidence (why would they be that stupid?). What if they&#39;ve just let that person go by now? </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious about the logistics mainly...but I guess this could fall under conspiracy. Since the news finally released the note, I&#39;m starting to really question the second person theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, some people were bitching about the SWAT team taking so long.  In reality I thought it was way too fast given the size of the hotel.  There was a cop who was shot in my city and the suspect ran into a little fleabag motel with maybe 30 rooms. It was a good 6 hours of lockdown and surrounding rouds blocked before all the rooms were clear.  I guess it took some time to review the security cameras, and evacuate the bystanders before they would go in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right... but one thing I did read was that there isn&#39;t any security footage on (at least Vegas) room floors. I was surprised by this fact because I thought....how could there be a second shooter, they would just see this person leave the room. Or, even just someone who helped him. OR...if there was a person who had no clue what he was doing. How do they know? Because there&#39;s no footage of the room. I guess they could ask ppl in surrounding rooms. But, no one was there 100% of the time. Not saying there was a second shooter. But, now that I know this whole camera info, I wonder how they can be so sure he didn&#39;t have someone else in the room (besides the maid), ever? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He rents 2 rooms with different vantage points and chooses to use the best one after knocking out 2 windows. He locks the door in between rooms. He sets up the cart and camera in front of the door in the less optimal room. The camera cord keeps the door ajar, but there are still 2 locked doors in whichever room he chooses to shoot from. The security guard never entered the room; he was shot through the door. The security guard is a hero because he continued to evacuate people in other rooms, aided the police/SWAT, and probably saved lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there any way we know that it was deadbolted? If deadbolted that&#39;s crazy as hell but those doors don&#39;t have handles on the opposite side so if it was just latched shut they don&#39;t have a handle to open it even though it&#39;s  unlocked and I could see there being spring loaded hinges that swing them shut, those aren&#39;t standard for connecting doors but then again I work in hotel maintenance and if I needed to replace a hinge and all I had was a spring loaded one I&#39;d throw it in there. I&#39;ve seen a lot of doors in the hotel I work that aren&#39;t supposed to have them but they do. Still that is interesting because you need a lot of maybes and what ifs for that door to be shut even if it&#39;s not deadbolted.</p>

I bet pol could figure it out:</p>

<p>If fbi wants to dispel the notion of him being a gun runner :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>look into the guest logs as far back as possible of every time Steve stayed at a casino</p></li>
<li><p>Verify those datess with video evidence and employee testimonials that he was always gambling - if he really was a high roller and he was well known enough to receive comps then it sod be easy to find employees, management and check in clerks that recognize him</p></li>
<li><p>Release footage from his last stay and his previous stays, footage that only shows him and him alone or maybe with his gf entering and exiting the room.
Not any Isis or antifa or terrorist types... </p></li>
<li><p>Show us what&#39;s on the note</p></li>
<li><p>Show us video footage of the night of shooting especially right before when a potential client couldve entered and when and where and how the police carried out the breach during the shooting as well as after to dispel the notion of additional bodies being removed so we can corroborate with police scanner.</p></li>
<li><p>Release this info NOW or ASAP so people can&#39;t claim that the footage was edited (removed, refilmed) and so that the employees, management, check in clerks, bag boys, bar tenders even the casino owner or higher ups don&#39;t have time to be pressures into lying or collaborating to fit the gambling narrative
I mean is that really too much to ask?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you explain why? The tiny explosion hardly even damaged that door. You&#39;ve seen the photos of it. Swat had no real reason to rush in there. The gun fire had been over for almost an hour and they had the floor on lock down. Seems very unsafe. I get it if he was still shooting, go in guns blazing but no shots almost an hour... blow the door?? When it&#39;s already open??? And the security guard already had a key card for the cops to use cuz they were checking all the other rooms in the area, but didn&#39;t breach any others....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what i was thinking the whole time. The security gaurd killed paddock, shot up the concert. Then shot himself in the leg to make it look like paddock did it. Escaped in plain site. </p>

<p>Oh, and paddock was an arms dealer to the underworld. This explains why he had the explosives and all those guns.</p>

<p>The reason for the locations around the public was to have insurances that have the gun deals go sour, the American public would suffer. </p>

<p>so how is that possible? the shooter locked the door from the other side and then went through the hall to get to the room he was found dead in?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But did they even try? Also him &quot;clearing rooms&quot; is really odd. He got shot and they didn&#39;t ask him questions about the interaction with him and the shooter. After when he was told to get medical help could&#39;ve just walked off. </p>
