        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;From where she was crouching, Nichols saw a police officer setting up a gun. “It was pointing up at Mandalay Bay, and I saw, like, this green flash, and I was like, What’s that?” Nichols had her phone in her hand, so she started filming a video. (In it, as the cop aims his rifle in front of a lit-up booth selling chicken strips, you can hear a woman weeping and hyperventilating, while a male voice tells people to stay down.) “I turned to the people next to me, and I go, ‘Did you guys see that light? Is that where the shooter is?’ I know nothing about guns. They go, ‘Absolutely. That’s the shooter.’ And they shove me back down.”</p>

<p>I searched everywhere for the video posted by Kara Nichols of an officer setting up his weapon to fire towards a green light coming from the Mandalay Bay and I can&#39;t find it anywhere. I found her Facebook page, but it&#39;s private. </p>

<p>Curious if anyone has heard of this green light, or if you&#39;ve seen video of what she&#39;s describing. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link to the story in the New Yorker

    <div class="md"><p>True, hence why my question was if anyone had seen footage of the green light she described or of an officer aiming his weapon in that direction. In other words, is there any video out there or other witness testimony that would corroborate what she claims to have captured on video herself since her video may not be public.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, you did disagree - by stating, &quot;The time line really isn&#39;t strange.&quot;</p>

<p>Further, you did not &quot;relay facts...&quot; What you did was to regurgitate information that was offered at a news conference to a press that is complicit in re-telling things just how they&#39;re told, in order that they might maintain access...information that has since changed - several times. Not the facts.... A bit of facts. A minimal portion of some of the facts that fit a narrative...so far....</p>

<p>Additionally, you <em>did</em> state an opinion about &quot;long-standing procedures and practices of Law Enforcement Agencies all over the world...&quot; in declaring that, &quot;Law enforcement doesn&#39;t typically Demolition Man around and risk even greater loss of life.&quot; That is not at all what I implied. I specifically, and only, questioned a time line between three moments. You brought up methodology, not me.</p>

<p>But, you&#39;re probably right about exactly what happened down to the last detail. It&#39;s all cleared up and totally logical, what happened. You think?</p>

<p>So, <em>SIX DAYS</em> later, you make it back to bait me with some bullshit about how I don&#39;t know anything, but you know it all? That you did not write what is right up there?⬆︎</p>

<p>Your use of the abbreviation LVMPD make me suspect of your intentions. I mean, who says that?</p>

<p>If I was talking about Baltimore, I would simply say, &quot;Baltimore Police&quot;, or &quot;the police&quot;, or even The Baltimore PD.</p>

<p>I see <strong>LVMPD</strong>, and I figure you have a pony in the race.</p>

<p>Six days later?...you must be really busy...are they? Keeping you pretty busy...?</p>

<ul>
<li>I smell a stinker. I suspect you are something greater or lesser than a concerned fact-seeker.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stop wasting my time.</p>
