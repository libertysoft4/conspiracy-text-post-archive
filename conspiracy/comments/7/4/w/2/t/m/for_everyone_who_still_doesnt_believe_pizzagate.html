    <div class="md"><p>I think a little of both. Trump is part of that old, mostly died out Lansky crime syndicate. It seems the Judeo-RUssian mob financed Trumps elevation. Trump&#39;s father Fred was also tight with the New York Chassidic Jews, Chabad Lubavitch.</p>

<p>Israel and its Mossad know that Trump was more controllable than Hillary because of his sexual compromised (all those girls Trump raped). So they wanted Trump. Also, they want to finish the neocon agenda before they allow in unfettered &#39;progressive&quot; communitarianism. Bush&#39;s neocons left much unfinished, like Iran and Syria, for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he called for boots on the ground then, it was against ISIS rather than Assad: a considerably saner take. Clinton called for a no fly zone in Syria during the election which would have meant conflict with Russia. Russia, at the time started large scale nuclear drills. I don&#39;t discount the possibility Trump will end up in some military quagmire, but the isolationism he sold during with campaign was a lot less hawkish than Clinton&#39;s line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No but he has a very very long history of acting like a shitty person, saying shitty things, lying, contradicting himself, advocating for shitty policies that are counter to everything this sub should be about. Since coming into office he&#39;s literally sold out to every big money interest in washington (wall st, big oil/coal, private prisons, nra, pharmaceutical companies, telecoms, military industry, etc.) and still you cant see anything he&#39;s done wrong. While were at it how about permanently tarnishing America&#39;s international standing, vacationing more than any president in modern history while using it to personally profiting from taxpayers, encouraging congress to cut healthcare for the middle class but cut taxes for the 1% and done more than anyone else to sow mistrust, divide and fuel identity/cultural wars than anyone else why simultaneously calming to hate identity politics. This is your idea of a leader? Wake up, jesus. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s a total sell-out, which is why corporate media is going after him harder than they&#39;ve ever gone after anyone and why globalist world leaders go out of their way to insult him. Got it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While were at it how about permanently tarnishing America&#39;s international standing</p>

<p>Killing half a million people in Iraq, turning Libya into a jihadist human trafficking hub with open slave markets, CIA spying on senate computers so they can get away with torture... wouldn&#39;t want to tarnish that solid rep. ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>encouraging congress to cut healthcare for the middle class but cut taxes for the 1%</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, the GOP trying to do this is so out of character and definitely Trump&#39;s fault. ;)</p>

<p>Trump got TPP scrapped, scuttled Paris Argeement globalist money grab, averted war with Russia over Syria, is actually dealing with North Korea rather than letting the situation fester, and with him at the helm ISIS is continually retreating... what a monster. ;) Pay less attention to what Trump says and more on the results. As with Bush Jr., Trump&#39;s persona is a strategic act (but unlike Bush Jr., Trump doesn&#39;t seem to have a neocon hand up his ass... yet).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doubt Pizzagaters can be convinced by anything other than themselves, but these are my top 3 reasons I believe Pizzagate is nonsense:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The 100% complete and total lack of any evidence of a crime (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_delicti"><em>corpus delicti</em></a>). No crime scenes, no victims, no witnesses, no bodies. Literally, <em>nothing</em> that indicates the crimes you&#39;re accusing them of have taken place anywhere but in the minds of Pizzagaters, let alone evidence that ties them to these imaginary crimes.</p></li>
<li><p>The many lies from Pizzagaters, including the many lies in your repost. I usually don&#39;t rely on &quot;evidence&quot; that turns out to be fabricated, misattributed, etc. And most Pizzagate evidence is either <em>extremely</em> easy to explain, or an outright lie. Most Pizzagaters don&#39;t seem to care, though, and continue to spread the lies. It&#39;s hard to believe a story told by liars based on lies is somehow magically true.</p></li>
<li><p>The constant demands from Pizzagaters that the authorities should &quot;investigate&quot; and prosecute individuals based on &quot;weird&quot; art (1st Amendment) with no evidence that a crime took place (4th Amendment) simply because anonymous strangers lobbed accusations at them (6th Amendment). It&#39;s a literal witch-hunt and it&#39;s sick. It&#39;s scary to think there are Americans out there that are willing to trample all over other people&#39;s rights and are literally trying to ruin their lives based on lies and evidence-less accusations.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That about covers it. It&#39;s all exhibited in your single repost, actually. Once you account for the <strong>lies</strong> and such, the &quot;theory&quot; (which is nothing more than malicious accusations) is beyond preposterous. Of course, you&#39;d have to look at the &quot;evidence&quot; (using that term <em>extremely</em> loosely here) objectively, something Pizzagaters seem unwilling to do.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ng1qb/for_all_the_new_people_and_shills_in_rconspiracy/"><strong>#pizzagate</strong></a> (aka #pedogate) is the new 9/11 rabbit hole -- i.e., yes, it&#39;s all (mostly) true -- and yes, difficult to swallow.  But yes...  it&#39;s very real -- i.e., there are real children who are being trafficked, raped and murdered right now through these channels. (really... right now.)</p>

<p>And it needs to be stopped.</p>

</ul>

<p>NOTE: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=define%3A+chickenlover#safe=off&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=chicken+lover+meaning">&quot;chickenlover&quot; defined:</a> == <strong><em>&quot;An adult male homosexual sexually attracted to underage males. Used somewhat derogatorily.&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>alone, i would chalk-it-up to gays goofing around.</p>

<p>but... then again... here is another instrgram that james alefantis posted before he closed off his account -- in which key words &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;killroom&quot; are referenced somewhat oddly:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>no, it&#39;s not a smoking gun.  alone, i would brush it off as ... just... weird.</p>

<p>maybe even creepy.</p>

<p>but it&#39;s definitely odd.  </p>

<p>especially when you consider the &quot;chickenlover&quot; reference -- even though i&#39;m sure it&#39;s just gay humor ;)</p>

<p>but then... </p>

<p>when you add the basket of random babies and toddlers that james alefantis (and staff) posted to instagram (before they quit - a clear sign of guilt, right?):</p>

<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE / all i am saying is:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I believe the FBI should investigate that whole neighborhood surrounding commit pizza, but...</p></li>
<li><p>I think we can all agree it&#39;s worth at least one formal DC Metro Police - at least one.  No harm no foul for a police officer / child services officer to show up and knock on the door, right??</p></li>

People still pursuing it feel like they&#39;re pushing an agenda that the people that published it want pushed. It&#39;s ridiculous, the biggest one was the grandma talking about her grandkids coming to the party and letting the other parents and grandparents know to bring their kids so they have kids to play with. Taking something that innocent and innocuous and making it seem like something nefarious is some kind of mental illness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha yeah man, such an innocent grandmother who loves children so much she never had any kids of her own. Rather she married a man 3 years before he died and speaks about  <em>his</em> grandchildren with such terms as &#39;&#39;We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.&#39;&#39; Or my personal favourite, &quot;And for a limited time only, you can spend time with her (Evie Luzzatto) online, raw and uncut&quot; </p>

<p>So innocent man, as you say, it must require <em>mental illness</em> to find anything at all strange about that wording. Tsk tsk on anyone that does...</p>

<p>Also, what do you mean specifically by &#39;debunked the absolute shit out of&#39; and &#39;wikileaks tampered with the dump&#39;?

    <div class="md"><p>Funny how you ran off without waiting for my answer. No, I did not say that, although anyone with half a brain wouldnt trust them, do you? Great to see you addressing the bulk of my statement though /s.</p>

<p>As for your strawman rhetoric ill provide you a lesson in why you dont speak about things you dont know. Google DKIM doesnt mean the validity falls onto Google, as if it is some creation of theirs lol, we are taking an independant source originally used to fight spam, and widely adopted by numerous online outlets as a premier source for email verification. If a mail server is DKIM enabled it will cryptographically sign emails as they are sent so that the recipients’ mail servers can authenticate them. This has the effect of making the emails what they say, &quot;cryptographically non-repudiable&quot;. If you want to argue the validity of DKIM authentication then be my guest, thats an argument for another day, theres plenty more people with far more knowledge than I have that can allay your fears. </p>

<p>It was a nice attempt though, well kind of. It only took one comment to take you from defending the actual content to placing doubt on the actual veracity of the emails themselves. Very telling. But while we are still on this topic could you kindly back up your original claim and tell me the specifics as to how Wikileaks tampered with the emails and what effect that had on the <em>validity</em> of the source material. Cheers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t even make sense. That&#39;s like saying if you were on your way to building a case for murder, that it &#39;had been debunked&#39; before you reached an end. </p>

<p>It&#39;s simply a volume of evidence.  You can make what want out of any sum of it.  Prove - disprove, debunk, etc.. those words mean nothing without a concrete  hypothesis to falsify.  It&#39;s like people like you give candid glimpse into your prejudice, bias and <em>what you want or prefer</em> to believe, when you offhandedly just say something like that.  You realize that, right?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because they are the only ones that know about it. I&#39;m not a Trump supporter.

<p>You don&#39;t think there&#39;s progressives that have looked into?  Why does it seem that all Hillary supporters mock it or objcetively look at it for what it is.  It&#39;s not something that can just be &#39;de-bunked&#39; like you want to, and you damn well know you are saying that because of a political agenda.  That&#39;s non-objective.  But yes, there&#39;s probably the same fanatical on the other side, with how it relates to the <em>extent</em> of the evidence. </p>

<p>But for you to deny it all, outright... come on man.  Just be real and take a little time with EACH step of evidence to critically challenge your own preconceptions.</p>

<p>Either do that, or leave it alone and not &#39;mock.&#39;  Is that fair enough?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It convinces me that there is a clear agenda to push. The sheer number of people left out is staggering. For example, start @ Clinton. Go up to Epstein. it says Bill Clinton flew in Epstein&#39;s plane. Fair enough, that&#39;s a factual statement. Notice who&#39;s missing? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you some hints:</p>

<p>Epstein was a &quot;regular&quot; at this person&#39;s Florida club for the elite. </p>

<p>This person was on the witness list for the case against Epstein&#39;s crimes.</p>

<p>This person once said &quot;I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. [Epstein is] a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.&quot;</p>

<p>This person&#39;s choice labor secretary cut a non-prosecution deal with Epstein, ensuring he only went to jail for 13 months instead of prison for life. </p>

<p>This person and Epstein were simultaneously sued for raping a 13 year old girl. </p>

<p>Epstein stated in the early 2000&#39;s that this person frequently dined at his home.</p>

<p>Newspapers and magazines frequently claimed Epstein and this person were friends before his conviction.</p>

<p>When the FBI raided Epstein&#39;s house, they found a phone book with 14 different phone numbers for this person, not counting the numbers for this person&#39;s security guard, houseman, wife, and daughter. </p>

<p>When testifying under oath, Epstein claimed he socialized with this person. When asked “Have you ever socialized with [This Person] in the presence of females under the age of 18?”, Epstein pleaded the fifth amendment. </p>

<p>Epstein&#39;s brother claimed under oath that this person took trips on the infamous &quot;Lolita Express&quot; jet <strong>at least</strong> once.</p>

<p>Do you know who &quot;this person&quot; is yet? It&#39;s Donald J. Trump. The current sitting president of our country. </p>

<p>For a conspiracy centered around high ranking politicians and rich powerful people, isn&#39;t it awfully convenient to leave out the president who is allegedly one of the richest Americans? Isn&#39;t it weird that Trump appointed the person who kept Epstein out of prison for life to a position he&#39;s unqualified for? </p>

<p>Those alone makes me incredibly suspicious of the motives of this post. It&#39;s staggeringly disingenuous. I guess I&#39;m a shill for pointing that out, eh?</p>

Maybe I&#39;m just ignorant, or haven&#39;t looked in the right places, but since the pizzagate scandal has come to light, I&#39;ve yet to see the infographics that even mention Trump. Before the pizzagate sub was nuked, there was a long post claiming to be a &quot;definitive list&quot; of every major person implicated in pizzagate. Trump, of course, was missing from that list. 1/4 of the comments were asking why Trump wasn&#39;t on it, and listed the claims I made above. Then OP deleted the post and his account. Comes across as suspicious to me.</p>

<p>The Trump apologists in this sub are way past &quot;partisan bias&quot;. I&#39;ve never seen the people here so complacent towards politician or a billionaire, let alone one with the connections and allegations that Trump has against him, let alone one who&#39;s a sitting president. The claims I posted against Trump are more substantial than at least 1 of the people in the infographic OP posted. There&#39;s a clear line between bias and agenda, and a lot of the people looking into pizzagate are locked into an agenda which obscures the truth even further. It gives the illusion of missing links and dead ends, so people stop looking deeper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s just weird how absolutely against the whole pizza gate thing without providing any counter points to a single reply here other than insults and you call me the anti-intellectual?</p>

<p>I’ll put it this way. If you had done actual research yourself and seen the evidence first hand (I have seen the Instagram posts from James Alefantis before he went private. I have also read all of the emails that were leaked) you would at least say something isn’t right. Instead you just deny and deflect which is a pretty common tactic for someone who’s trying to spread a narrative. If you’re a member of this sub or just enjoy reading conspiracies how about actually engaging and responding with well thought out responses other than “if you believe this you’re stupid”?</p>

<p>Thats what gets me about this the most, is that while there is no solid rock hard PROOF, as in there&#39;s no semen stain with Podesta&#39;s DNA on the clothes of a kid who&#39;s been raped, what people seem to forget is that police aren&#39;t supposed to only investigate things for which the public has already provided hard evidence. They are supposed to have enough circumstantial evidence or witness reports to warrant going for a full investigation. </p>

<p>And there is SO MUCH circumstantial evidence here that there is something incredibly wrong going on, that it is utterly insane to me that people don&#39;t think that the police or FBI should check this all out to make sure that kids aren&#39;t being hurt. Surely when it comes to children it&#39;s always worth erring on the side of caution when you have people behaving in this manner?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just check out my most recent comments history. I share conspiracy of silence and one of the Hampstead videos and people just downvote me. I ask for people to simply watch the videos and not a single person does. Any argument thy have is &quot;kids are suggestible&quot; and &quot;discovery channel are not reliable&quot; despite it being an Granada production. I mention discovery to see if anyone who comments actually watched the links and not a single person did. Just see the downvotes, hive mind takes over and they join the herd. It just makes me wonder why do I bother? Who am I trying to help? No matter what evidence you put forward it won&#39;t matter, they have been brainwashed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow thanks OP that’s a nice web. Still missing a couple things for sure. The Gallas with Chris Cornell and the clintons at Norovax. Why he was over there who knows. Chester Bennington living down the street from John Podesta when he was a kid. He had to walk past Lincoln Park every day to get to school. Mk ultra. I mean conspiracy but a lot ties to being red pulled as far as politics. What they try to cover up. It’s just so “out there” I get it but I think it’s funny people look away before actually considering. Interesting connections for sure. Definitely more to this than the Russia-Trump conspiracies... cuz that’s exactly what they are anyone who says different obviously just believes without critical thinking. </p>

He&#39;s just promoting rebulican brand of war which is terrorist, Iran and china. She called for that because thats something reasonable diplomacy could achieve. If calling for a safe zone is your idea of hawkish then I wont argue. You also forget that he was massacring his people and condemned by the international community. The alternative wouldnt have been great either.</p>
