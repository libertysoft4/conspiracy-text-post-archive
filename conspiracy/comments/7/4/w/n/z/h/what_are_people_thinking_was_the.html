    <div class="md"><p>I saw a theory about a major casino heist which sounds kinda similar. The mass shooting was the major distraction and it makes sense with the claims of shooters in so many other hotels. But they won&#39;t make it public because of it giving ideas to more people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds jooocy. How much would the take be? Millions? Multi-millions? But if that were the case, why not just detonate a bomb closeby, or shoot indiscriminately. You still cause the same chaos without such high needless casualties.</p>

<p>Over 500 shot, that guy wanted blood. If this was agenda pushing, couldn&#39;t a magazine or three fired off, with only several deaths have the same effect? </p>

<p>Is this just TPTB wanting to keep the weight of panic and fear in the people&#39;s everyday lives?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is crazy I agree. But the more shots and deaths the more distraction. It&#39;s just a theory. It does make sense though. If you heard the police scanner there was supposedly shooters in multiple other hotels. Though I feel if they were robbing them people would have seen or there would have been casualties in said hotels. Who knows man. We&#39;ll never know the truth lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m swimming against the current here and thinking Steve paddock is being grossly underestimated. We know for a fact he was a smart, successful man and I think we can agree the average guy can’t accomplish what he has. Independent Self made millionaire who managed to stay rich says a lot. I’m still not buying the multiple shooter speculation either, the would have been able to detonate the explosives finishing the plan if there were accomplices. The fact that he killed him self because he thought he was out of time with the security guard there thinking it was the police says a lot. He panicked didn’t get to finish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Despite what the media says the DDM4 and Colt AR15&#39;s are not valued at $5-10,000.00 a piece. Closer to $1,500-$2,000 each. Now figure in black market value or used gun value which cuts the value almost in half. We don&#39;t know the full extent of the arsenal but assuming he could sell them for $1000 each, he would only really be making around $23,000.00 at best. Seems like a lot of work for little payoff considering he was a gambler and it&#39;s Vegas. $23,000 is a lot of money to most, myself included but in Vegas it&#39;s not considered much. Not to mention that I doubt bump stocks are a hot commodity on the black market. </p>

Making sure the untouchable upper class of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/73ucht/saudi_arabia_is_mass_murdering_its_shia/">a society far away from any western values</a> were having a good time in Las Vegas, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/73ucht/saudi_arabia_is_mass_murdering_its_shia/dntnkzq/">whatever their passions</a>. This time a couple of doped up princes decided to have some fun in the hotel instead of waiting to go firing some guns and blow some stuff up in the morning. Allahu snack bar on a crowd of infidels while his posse were dealing with the situation best they could: suiciding Paddock, pouring a continuous stream of 200 rounds down the hallway to make sure no one dared peaking the corner while they made their escape up through the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/NHkC5">emergency stairs located right outside the suite to the right</a>, and finally by heli from the roof of the Mandalay to the <a href="https://youth.be/gpMrm1xUJ40?t=24m15s">next door airport</a> where the jet was being warmed up. </p>
