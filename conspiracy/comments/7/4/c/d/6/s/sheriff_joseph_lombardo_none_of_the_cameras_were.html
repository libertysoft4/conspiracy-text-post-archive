    <div class="md"><p>He simply set the camera up so he could know when they were approaching his room. </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t want to be captured alive so he wanted to ensure he had ample time to off himself before being wounded and arrested. So he set up a few cameras to livestream to his laptop as a security system of sorts. </p>

<p>Absolutely NO reason to record those feeds in his mind. Why bother? </p>

<p>All that said, you&#39;d think someone going through all that trouble would record some sort of motive or goodbye separately. </p>

<p>Just not that unusual that his security cams weren&#39;t recording.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. He saw hotel security and blasted them through the door. Apparently unloading nearly 200 rounds into the hallway. He wounded one and they retreated.

<ol>
<li>You are lying</li>
<li>You are misremembering the time that you heard the feed</li>
<li>The police and everyone else is lying about the timeline</li>
<li>The feed that you listened to was not live.</li>

<p>I&#39;d say that #2 and #4 are the most likely explanations</p>

<p>You&#39;re also ignoring the security guard who approached the door and was shot. He told police exactly what room it was. He and the police as they arrived stayed in the hallway watching the door from a distance.</p>

<p>Even if the security guard hadn&#39;t been there they would have certainly locked down the building and checked everyone inside until they found the shooter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like maybe if they discovered he was some type of insect that could operate 4 rifles at a time, I&#39;d agree with the &quot;having something bigger planed&quot;...but idk, it&#39;s very strange behavior.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not necessarily on board with the theory that he was a gun runner for the FBI or whatever. But wouldn&#39;t it be logical if you&#39;re going to follow through with a plan like this to stockpile as much AMMO as you can in the room and limit yourself to, oh I don&#39;t know, maybe just a half dozen rifles? Lol</p>

<p>And I&#39;d also like to find d out what his escape plan was according to the sherrif</p>

In some photos I noticed some rifles with very nice scopes also so I think he was planning on a much longer stand. Maybe he panicked when security got too the room so quickly or acted impulsively due too anxiety after the fact. Whatever went through dick heads head, I think he was planning something much bigger and it just fell through or didn&#39;t go the way he planned. He had another room booked downtown also so I&#39;m wondering what he was planning their.</p>

<p>However I feel like if he did use a gopro or another camera with an app, and was using a phone/tablet to view the feed, they should also look on the phone to ensure that stuff wasnt recorded straight to the phone (another option you can use with the GoPro app) or straight to a cloud. </p>
