        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you were a shooter, and you were planning on killing as many people as possible before you got caught, why would you stop not even half-way into the arsenal you have? I think the answer is obvious. He wouldn&#39;t. He wouldn&#39;t stop shooting because he clearly had heaps of time to do more damage to the thousands trapped on the stage. The only way that I can see the shooting stopping is if the shooter dies or if he runs out of bullets, so what&#39;s the deal here? I believe that the shooting stopped because whoever was behind it needed time to kill Paddock, break his window, and set him up. If you didn&#39;t already know the following PAY ATTENTION:<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
Footage of the shooting has been proven time and time again on here using some excellent analysis. <strong>The gun that was shot out of Mandalay Bay was not a bump stock rifle, it was a 100 round belt-fed LMG.</strong> There is still a discussion debating which LMG it is, whether it&#39;s an M240, or something similar. Still, <strong>the audio has been proven to not be bump-stock fire.</strong> Remember this, because only bump-stock rifles were found in Stephen&#39;s room. No LMG&#39;s were found, which leads me to my conclusion. I believe based on my analysis of the windows, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74qrxy/i_dont_think_stephen_paddocks_window_was_broken/">here</a> which shows that Paddock&#39;s window wasn&#39;t broken during the shooting, along with the guns found in his suite NOT matching the gunfire, that we need to thoroughly investigate who bought the guest room at Mandalay Bay. Because I really believe someone else bought it and shot an M240 out of it. Even makes the two pistol shots heard make sense, if someone else did the killing of Paddock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me- that empty hour is the
Biggest part of this mystery.   </p>

<p>For all the reasons you list.  </p>

<p>My take- it was the sec guard, Jesus.   He did &quot;knock&quot; on door at say 11 min into shooting- only to be shot at 200 times.   </p>

<p>My thinking- paddock thought Jesus was full on swat breach team, and this was the end.   I&#39;m thinking.. he likely
Killing himself around 15 min in- and lay dead until swat showed up.  </p>

<p>All hail Jesus.  ????</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said, it&#39;s more likely someone shot up the venue with an M240 and there were no weapons matching that in his suite. I think he already had the guns, and worked for the CIA. According to ISIS, he recently switched religions.

    <div class="md"><p>In a different thread someone brought up that the snorkel looking thing in the room could be a cpap machine or some kind of breathing apparatus for filtering the air. I have a hard time believing he had no hearing protection though. Especially if it was a breathing apparatus then it means he had the foresight to filter the lead filled, smoky air but not to have ear pro? It will be interesting to see what comes up in the next couple weeks because this whole thing is crazy inconsistent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have a belt fed firearm, why the fuck would you stop at 100 rounds? LMG&#39;s like this are typically loaded up with MUCH larger belts. Why only 100 when you have 20 100 round magazines for AR15 style weapons? Also like someone else said there there are no links on the ground in the photos. At least the lack of brass is explainable if using an AR with bumpstock, they eject with a forward trajectory from hitting the brass deflector. The majority of the brass likely went out the window. disintegrating links, on the other hand, are not ejected but gather near the gun. I think armchair warriors are getting all worked up on this LMG shit. even the sound is consistent with a bumpstock with irregular fire rate and what i feel are jams. Both bumpstocks and those 100 round magazines are notorious for jams. If whatever shooter did this had shot these prior they would know this. This is why I believe there are numerous guns. Not to change between when out of ammo, but when there are jams. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was no M240 and there were no belts. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my theory.</p>

<p>There were 2 shooters. One was shooting at the rocket fuel tanks and Paddock was shooting at the people.</p>

<p>The guy shooting at the tanks ran out the door and barricaded the stairwells then escaped.</p>

<p>Security Guard &quot;Jesus Campos&quot; unlocks Paddock&#39;s door. The police said he had keys. Jesus bluffed and said the police were there. This panicked Paddock who took off his ear protection and started to shoot at Jesus. He failed to kill Jesus who was still taunting him. Paddock then shot himself in the mouth and did not escape.</p>

<p>Now this is a crazy theory. Was Jesus the other shooter and had a change of heart and attacked Paddock? Was Jesus executing Paddock as the fall guy? Or was Jesus a real hero who&#39;s identity and story is being protected by police to keep him safe from reprisals.</p>

<p>Are police withholding the real story in order to catch the other people with Paddock?</p>
