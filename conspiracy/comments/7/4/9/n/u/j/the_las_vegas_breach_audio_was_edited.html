        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have some questions about the audio of the breach of Stephen Paddock&#39;s room. I first saw the clip on YouTube...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EyoKuaJ10Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EyoKuaJ10Q</a></p>

<p>Which struck me as odd for a couple of reasons...</p>

<p>1) The fade out of the &quot;bang&quot; seems unnatural, like an audio fade.</p>

<p>2) The voice kicks in immediately saying &quot;Unit 20. We are clearing this room&quot;, and it seems that Paddock is already dead. There are no gunshots to be heard.</p>

<p>This clip is clearly edited.</p>

<p>Looking for another source, I also came across a second link, post at WDTN...</p>

<p><a href="http://wdtn.com/2017/10/02/audio-police-breach-stephen-paddocks-mandalay-bay-hotel-room-10-rifles-found/">http://wdtn.com/2017/10/02/audio-police-breach-stephen-paddocks-mandalay-bay-hotel-room-10-rifles-found/</a></p>

<p>It presents the same audio as two distinct clips.</p>

<p>The first, leading up to the &quot;bang&quot;, is identical, but the second clip is more interesting. Before the above &quot;Unit 20. We are clearing this room...&quot; line, you hear the same voice say the unit number, the dispatch beep, then a dispatcher confirm, then the clip resumes in the same manner.</p>

<p>Given the various reports on whether Paddock was already dead or not, I find it interesting, at least, that the audio sounds like it was edited to remove any gunfire. </p>

I find it strange that the police let the security guy go first, tou would think they would take the lead and keep him around because he knows the building, not as a lead in clearing the floors.</p>

<p>But I was listening to scanner broadcast live and nothing was edited. That&#39;s what was herd on the public channel. There is a point where all the rest of command and swat went to a special channel just for dealing with the 32nd floor. </p>

<p>If I can find links for things I will but most of that is audible as going down in the YouTube versions. </p>

<p>If anything, the unedited audio would be the two separate clips at WDTN, because that has extra lines after the bang, where Unit 20 and the dispatcher communicate before the &quot;Unit 20. We are clearing this room&quot; line.</p>
