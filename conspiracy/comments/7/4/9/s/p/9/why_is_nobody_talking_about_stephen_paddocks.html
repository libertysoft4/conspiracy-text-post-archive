<p>Why would ISIS spend 100k on less than 30 rifles? That is insane stupid.</p>

<p>With 100k you could buy crates of them closer to home and not in a hotel room in Vegas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems youre suggesting that ISIS would travel from the ME to LV to buy guns and then travel back to the ME to use those guns instead of the more likely scenario of buying the guns in LV and use them in LV or other parts of America.  </p>

<p>Also, the $100,000 was just money sent to his GF, not the purchase price of the guns.   Paddock had millions of his own money that he could have used to send her $100k.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guns where higher end AR15s and AR10s, that he bought legally since June. The estimated value of all these guns was about 100k. This is seperate from what he sent out.</p>

<p>Even if they were gonna use them in LV, why not go for better rifles or explosives? AKs (even the knock offs) could have killed more people because of their caliber. 2.23 vs 7.62. Why not get them from the Cartels already in the area and deal with some dude in a hotel room when Vegas is always packed with security?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can tell you why the US military uses the 5.56 vs the 7.62:  Accuracy at distance and lighter weight (so you can carry more ammo on you).  The 7.62 is a bigger bullet, but it is not traveling as fast and the ballistics are  much different between the two when they make contact and penetrate their targets.</p>

<p>Plus, ARs look scarier than AKs, supposedly, and of course terrorists are going to want the scarier guns ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, they both look the same to people who are scared of guns.</p>

<p>And bullet speed and drop have little bearing in the scenario of firing from a high vantage point down into a &quot;barrel of fish&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget the ballistic characteristics of the 5.56. It creates a wound channel that is devastating. And not to many countries still use 7.62x39 (AK-47). Hell even the Russians who invented it don&#39;t. They use the 5.45x39 round for the same reasons we use the 5.56. It&#39;s light, shoots flat, and has a destructive wound channel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be for the actual effect for which, I believe, the AR was made. It is a small fast round, it makes small less lethal wounds. The idea is if you wound 1 guy, at least 1 other guy now has to carry him, so it is a 2 for 1 deal. In this circumstance, it makes for a next level terror weapon, because of all the wounds and screaming that comes after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that my comment was downvoted and I&#39;ve had to talk at length about how loud and lethal guns are today with people who haven&#39;t even shot guns before speaks volumes as to who is all on this sub right now.</p>

<p>Our military isn&#39;t carrying guns designed to injure one so another carries him. That is a myth. These rounds are made to kill and stop the threat. That&#39;s kinda like saying 9mm are made to injure compared to 45s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t downvote you man. And the M-16 being designed to wound...I have heard that is and is not a myth. I don&#39;t really know what the truth is here, but many people believe the myth, if that is what it is. </p>

<p>And I got lost along the way in my comment up there. I remember trying to get saying he chose .223 because it is lighter to carry by half.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5.56/.223</p>

<p>Average .223/5.56 round:</p>

<p>Rounds per pound ~ 37.21rds</p>

<p>Weight per 100 rounds ~ 2.69lbs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And </p>

<blockquote>
<p>7.62x51/.308</p>

<p>Average .308/7.62x51 round:</p>

<p>Rounds per pound ~ 19.05rds</p>

<p>Weight per 100 rounds ~ 5.25lbs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could also be the guy was after gun control, and AR-15&#39;s seem to be the darling of gun control lobbyists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might be smalll but the idea is not to wound but cause devastating damage.. the 5.56/.223 round is designed to tumble when it hits an individual and it will rip you to shreds inside. The amount of animals I’ve kill with this round trust me it’s devastating. And for the guy who was supposedly shot 3 Times in the chest and survived, I highly doubt that!</p>

<p>If you&#39;re wondering about how to fake a win (which is what the &quot;professional gambler&quot; would want to do) this can be accomplished by pulling chips out of the pocket while playing, making it appear that these chips were won rather than purchased, and creating the paper trail that the &quot;professional gambler&quot; wants.</p>

Just another contractor working on a fancy house. Never thought about it before, but you could sink a ton of cash into renovating a property without any questions about where is came from, then sell it and take the check to the bank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question: Ignoring irregularities has anybody here made any complex argument why this whole thing appears to warrant a conspiracy? I mean what do you guys believe really happened and why?</p>

<p>A guy snapping and mowing down people is sadly nothing new. What is your starting point for arguing towards a conspiracy?</p>

<p>When things like this happened I personally always assumed that with billions of peoples it is bound to happen that some snap and their brains just stop working properly. Most don&#39;t have the tools, finances or finesse to pull something like this off.</p>

<p>Normally such persons kill their families, kids et cetera.</p>

<p>This happens so frequently that I personally think the most reasonable explanation is that he snapped like hundreds before him but instead of stabbing his children during their sleep he did this, because like I said he was able to pull it off.</p>

<p>I think there is a major difference between terror attacks and such events ( If I am correct ). Terror attacks are deliberate and based on some kind of rational argument ( even if it wrong ) while such shooting sprees are often caused by people whose brains stop working properly.</p>

<p>Where do people see the evidence or at least circumstantial evidence that this is anything but a guy snapper and trying to go out with a bang? </p>

<p>For me, it&#39;s the dad. Paddock&#39;s father being FBI Most Wanted and straight up disappearing from their lives is just wild and I can&#39;t wrap my head around it. Combined with Paddock himself being so un-noteworthy that he didn&#39;t even have a ticket on his license... I&#39;m not convinced of any theory, I&#39;m just poking around to see what I find, if anything. I can&#39;t even explain why his father&#39;s history has me so engrossed in Paddock himself&#39;s actions; it just does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he has to work somewhere. Again this only makes it more unlikely to be false flag IMO. Besides his skin colour he is a pretty special guy, I don&#39;t see why you would take someone like him but then again everybody can snap and at some point, it had to be a guy with enough money to do such thing.

<p>Well, yeah, but... as a defense contractor? For Lockheed Martin? When his dad was goddamn FBI Most Wanted? This isn&#39;t USPS. 78% of the money comes from military sales. That just doesn&#39;t fly with me.</p>

<p>I 100% agree with you and it&#39;s more than likely that&#39;s what this is, but this guy didn&#39;t &#39;snap&#39;. This guy had almost 50 weapons in his possession, specifically told his girlfriend to leave the country and wired $100,000 weeks before. We have to stop saying he &quot;snapped&quot; when this was methodically planned out for god knows how long, especially as he had no recorded history of mental illness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A problem is that we now thinkg Lockheed Martin is weird because it is &quot;exactly&quot; that. Assume he would have worked for the FBI, you would say the same, assume he was a cop you would say the same, assume he would have worked for a major bank, you would have said the same.</p>

<p>There is a big variety of jobs that would have created a comparable reaction in this community but for slightly different reasons. This is what I mean with &quot;he had to work somewhere&quot;.  He apparently was smart and somehow made a good buck very many jobs that fit into this life would have rigged your alarm bells. Earlier I said his special life resulted in this &quot;special&quot; event if he would have been an average american he would have been unable to pull this off. Imagine he would have been in the military like millions others, you would have likely said &quot;well he was in the military so they got to him&quot;.</p>

<p>I feel like I must have read this wrong because I don&#39;t understand it. Why would he have been unable to pull it off? He basically was an average American.

<p>My initial post asked for some kind of complete argument that puts those oddities into one frame. That&#39;s exactly what I meant, I have not seen anybody give a good explanation for this even an entirely theoretical one. I have not seen a reasonable &quot;why&quot; here. Some moon conspiracy theories have a better basis.</p>

<p>I have the feeling this major event made people immediately search for weird stuff ( that&#39;s ok ) and people are unable to calm down and say that at the moment there is hardly anything &quot;suspicious&quot; besides him being a guy with a weird history. Not seen any good theory why this was not just a guy who snapped and sadly had access to a lot of resources. What I agree with some &quot;trump supporters&quot; the silence about his political views lets me believe that he was likely leftish but that&#39;s obviously not really a conspiracy</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t obvious at all. Paddock didn&#39;t rob a gas station or even do something he gave a shit about coming out of alive.

    <div class="md"><p>People kill their own families all the time. Not sure why people here think this is rare. Happens every year in Germany that a family father snaps and for some incomprehensible reason starts to kill their entire family.</p>

<p>Such events are just different in the US because the people have easier access to weapons which allows them to creat a greater mess. People snapping and going on a rampage is nothing new and happens every year in big countries. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not necessarily true. First of all I don&#39;t know Paddocks motives  I personally assume the most likely factor was a psychological event and no political motive or no rational motive at all. If this is true then Paddocks behaviour is nothing special. Man sometimes grab their kids from school then execute them then drive to their own mothers and kill them too. Those are not necessarily impulse situations I don&#39;t talk about a guy losing it in an argument and killing somebody I talk about people snapping and then starting to kill everybody off the know. This is not that rare, but like I said often those are people less capable and it only hits the close surroundings of the person.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>In his mind I would argue, that all possibilities considered, he didn&#39;t ever want to run out of ammo or barrels. He had no money constraints he was making sure to not run out of firepower. Makes total sense to me. take any school shooting anywhere people bring everything they got, they never want to run out of ammo. I am not talking about the US exclusively. People who run amok bring everything they got, always. They loaded up with guns often bombs as well. </p>

<p>Again this is totally normal behaviour for a guy going berzerk but he had more money to do stuff like that.  </p>

<p>Yeah, because historically these shooters have never had more than a dozen guns.  The statement is patently false even in THIS example.  (The dude left half his guns at home!)  </p>

<p>Why would he lug literally 4 times more guns up to the 32nd floor than he could possibly need?  Unless of course there was another guy shooting out of the second window. I would assume if that is the case, that neither shooters were the dead guy on the floor with clean bullets and bullet casings dropped all over his pool of blood.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iam not seeing what you try to say. You think he brought too many guns? How much is to much if you plan on dieing while shooting on thousands of people.</p>

<p>I mean how does this make you suspect? He brought a lot of guns like dozens if not hundreds of persons running amok before him.</p>

<p>Which number of guns do you think was the right amount? </p>

<p>Why would the Columbine killers bring dozens of self-made explosives? Why do you feel this is special.</p>

<p>Why would you assume that. What is your basis for this assumption? That a nutjob brought a lot of weapons into a room which he prepared for a killing spree for days? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then why didn&#39;t he bring ALL his guns?  Why did he leave half of them at home?  (Clearly he didn&#39;t NEED them, that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t bring them.)  He obviously had a NEED for those weapons and the NEED was certainly not to fire them all himself. There is a very good chance he brought all those extra guns for the same reason I brought two-dozen extra forks to my company potluck last month.</p>

<p>Him being a multimillionaire doesn’t fit the “typical profile.” But, he did it (or is blamed to be the culprit, whatever you want to believe). Either way, when somebody commits an act such as this, what happens to his financials afterward? Seized by the government or passed along to next of kin or whomever he designated in a will?

Odd how a nutty Hispanic women told people at the festival &quot;you all are going to die today &quot; while harassing them and was tossed by security. There are multiple people reporting this ( very credible looking), zero footage from security cameras coming out as did with Boston bombers incident. 
Country music is associated with Republicans ( perfect target for those hating Trump and wanting gun control) .. yet our media and government is dumb founded c&#39;mon he was either a out of work agent went rouge or there are elements in our government that desire to get power back by horrible means. If he was solely a cartel the feds would be all over this not scrubbing records and hiding video footage. Why are they asking for private camera footage when every inch of that city is under surveillance?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s be logical for a second. Why would an arms dealer have platforms set up in his windows? Even if it was, by a stretch of the imagination, an arms deal gone bad which resulted in a shootout, why would someone take the time to go to two windows to shoot down at a random concert thousands of feet away? Why not get the fuck out of there once the shit started going down? Who in their right mind would stay there, give away their firing position to a crowd of 20000 people, and only after that, try to escape? These arms deal theories, along with the other conspiracy theories are just guesses at this point. The direction we should be looking in is what was on those cameras and what was on that note on his table. Also, if the leaked receipt is accurate, there may have been an accomplice. Even the sheriff, who&#39;s up for re-election next year, hasn&#39;t ruled that out.</p>

<p>That would be true if ISIS hadn&#39;t taken credit for this event.  If he was meeting with ISIS in a Fast and Furious style weapons negotiation, it would explain the cameras and reason he brought so many guns and ammo.  If ISIS had planned all along to conduct that massacre, he could have easily been a stooge.  If ISIS outsmarted the FBI, they aren&#39;t gonna want the public to find out about it, seeing as how this is the worst massacre in modern history.   </p>

<p>The direction we should be looking is ISIS--those psychopathic murderers who have never before this taken credit for massacres they weren&#39;t connected to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From a Slate.com article published 3 days ago: &quot;Terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank suggests in a Twitter thread Monday that ISIS’s claims seem to be getting less reliable. The group claimed credit for a June attack that killed 37 people at a casino in Manila, Philippines, which appears to have actually been a botched robbery by an indebted gambler. ISIS also claimed, after a British Airways flight at Charles de Gaulle Airport was evacuated last month, that it had planted bombs there. There were no bombs, and the evacuation was due to an unrelated incident.&quot;</p>

<p>Why do people think this is somehow so mysterious. Every new information I have seen somehow feels it fits right nicely. Where is the part that doesn&#39;t add up? People snap. </p>

<p>Think about it, the shooter has such a plain benign MO &quot;Middle age, white accountant with no previous gun history&quot; but for some reason he decided to purchase a ton of guns and kill innocent people. This causes people to think &quot;well if a regular ol&#39; white accountant could snap, so could ANYONE right?, and if that&#39;s the case, we better take away the guns!&quot;.</p>

<p>While I do see the logic in this, I don&#39;t understand the timing - would a Republican Presidency, Senate and Congress not hugely impede this argument? Seems better to do this during a Democratic swing instead of one where a large right-wing base is heavily mobilized.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that obvious? The entire incident wasn&#39;t doable for a &quot;normal&quot; person, with normal I mean average. You underestimate how much possibilities there are to fuck up stuff like that. The average shmo is too dumb to rob a gas station without showing its face to the camera or trip over his own foot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t obvious at all. Paddock didn&#39;t rob a gas station or even do something he gave a shit about coming out of alive. Shooting a whole bunch of people at once is so unremarkable that kids do it at their schools with depressing regularity. There&#39;s absolutely nothing about this that required a mastermind. What was there to fuck up? Get guns in room, shoot out window. Literally that simple.</p>
