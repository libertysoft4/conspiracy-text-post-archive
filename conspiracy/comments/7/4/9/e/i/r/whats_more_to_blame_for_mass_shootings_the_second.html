    <div class="md"><p>there have definitely been mass shootings in canada, certainly not as many as in the US, but you&#39;re talking about a country of 35 million versus one of 320 million. I&#39;m not even making the argument that gun laws shouldn&#39;t be stricter in the US. </p>

<p>Did you have a link to one of his news briefings where he talks about saving the 30,000 lives lost to distracted driving?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He made his announcement at a conference in Washington that included 300 academics, law enforcement officials, legislators, telecommunications and automobile industry representatives, as well as families of people killed by motorists who were talking on cellphones or text messaging.</p>

<p>“This meeting is probably the most important meeting in the history of the Department of Transportation,” Mr. LaHood said at the end of the two-day conference. He added that the order to restrict text messaging by federal employees behind the wheel “sends a very clear signal to the American public that distracted driving is dangerous and unacceptable.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok clearly this is difficult for you to follow - obama got on live news 13 times to say &quot;we need more gun laws&quot; - even though murder has been illegal for hundreds of years.. When did he get on live news for the 240,000 people who died from distracted driving during his term.  </p>

<p>Not some executive order announcement at some conference that was not on national live news channels.  Making any more sense to you yet? easier to follow yet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s either. Honestly, laws only keep honest people honest. By definition, criminals do not obey the law. How could gun control laws help at all? Isn&#39;t murder already illegal, even if it&#39;s committed by use of a spoon? I&#39;m trying to follow the logic here but studies have repeatedly shown that people who watch/play violent things are less likely to commit a violent crime in life. I don&#39;t think we have anything worse than we ever had, it&#39;s most likely that now with a 24 hour news cycle and the speed of the internet things get around globally much better. It seems to me like the tougher laws get the easier it is for criminals to commit crimes without having to worry about a law abiding citizen might attempt to stop them.</p>
