        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am not believing the story that he stopped shooting within 10 minutes after shooting the security guard then killing himself an hour before metro entered the room.</p>

<p>Major Las Vegas casinos have on duty tactical response teams on site at all times. These guys are all former special forces and off duty swat guys. They sit in a backroom waiting for robberies or situations like this to happen when they are called to action.</p>

<p>All of the floors have cameras and listening devices on them so it would not be difficult for security to isolate the floor and send their own tactical response team to the floor and put a stop to the threat. These guys are highly trained former SF and PMCs on their home turf.</p>

<p>This team when up freight elevator, made entry to the room where one of their guys took a hit coming through the door and the next guy in put a bullet in the back of the shooters head.</p>

<p>The police could not respond in this amount of time. Some regular security guard is not knocking on the door to see what&#39;s happening by himself. From the limited photos we have all seen there was still lots of ammo loaded ready to cause more havoc. So it doesn&#39;t make sense that he would stop. </p>

<p>The only answer for a 10 minute response is a highly trained tactical team to be on site with advanced knowledge of the room layout and how to breach the room.</p>

<p>TL;DR Mandalay has an on site private tactical team they went up within 10 minutes of the first shot and took out the shooter. The &quot;security guard&quot; shot was part of the private tactical team and was hit on the way in the room. </p>

<p>As far as shot placement I couldn&#39;t really say but these guys are incredibly proficient shooters. I would need to see a lot more photos of the gunman and the area around him. Then probably take a forensic gunshot class to make a non-conspiracy theory judgment on it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just not buying that with rounds still loaded up and swat an hour away that he would have stopped and shot himself. </p>

<p>“This is the first time I’ve ever revealed this publicly … there’s a division in the Marine Corps of special people that are specially trained to guard the embassies. That’s a whole division with separate base, separate training. There are almost 40 of them at every opening of my building, plain clothes, armed, on the look-out, changing shift and being relieved every two hours so they don’t get bored.”</p>

<p>Wynn also said he implemented new covert security measures that became operational last summer. &quot;We have another group of a half a dozen seals team six guys and CIA guys who are a counterterrorism unit that ... relate on a daily basis to Homeland Security, the FBI and Metro,&quot; he said. &quot;My company has metal detectors and devices at every entrance of the building for employees and guests that are non-visible to the public. We have done extraordinary things to make that sure we protect our employees and our guests at the hotel.&quot;</p>

<p>That reads like he’s just thrown a heap of buzzwords in and is talking out his ass.</p>

<p>I don’t doubt these casinos have some of the best private security in the world but they’re not a band of Blackwateresque mercenaries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah not blackwater. Just SEALs, CIA and the Marines who guard embassies. Green Berets do more covert work training and supplying rebels rather than being a direct action force though they do direct action as well I don&#39;t believe it is their primary roll. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was using the term special forces very broadly. I would consider SEALs, Green Berets, Delta, and whatever other elite groups special forces.

    <div class="md"><p>So is this implying the security guard was a second shooter?</p>

<p>I could be wrong about this, but wasn&#39;t the door barricaded? Making it impossible for someone to leave the room?</p>

<p>All the following is keeping in mind there were police on the floor 3 minutes after the final shots (which videos seem to prove was 2 pistol shots, 11 seconds apart, about 40 seconds after automatic fire that people are suggesting was the fire through the door that hit the security guard).</p>

<p>Everything I&#39;m about to say I admittedly really don&#39;t know much about and am assuming, if you can prove me wrong please do. </p>

<p>A shot in the leg would leave some sort of blood splatter- meaning the security guard would have had to shoot himself in the hallway to follow his story (and also to not leave a trail of blood from inside the room to the hallway). However, no gun was found on him or outside the room, and I find it very unlikely he could have disposed of it within that three minutes (is it confirmed the first police officers on the floor made contact with him?). The only possible way could be throwing it into the room, but without leaving a blood trail or other forensic evidence. Also, his story is he was shot with a rifle round. The videos show the last shots being pistol rounds, so he would have had to shoot himself, then later use the pistol and go into the hallway. </p>

<p>All this while going pretty much immediately into police/medical care. So he would have had to emotionally cover up the shooting, as well as any evidence of it (i.e. Gunfire residue/smell). And leave no forensic evidence in the room. Plus any video/witness of the door or hallway would make this impossible.</p>

<p>That being said, I think it is suspicious an unarmed normal security guard would go to the door (and stay on the floor after shooting). The same for the reported &quot;200 shots&quot; at the door for a single guard, when Paddock had the security cameras of the hall. The cameras and all the guns make it seem like Paddock wanted/was prepared for a standoff, so idk why he&#39;d kill himself after the guard came and not keep shooting. Honestly I think the casino security team theory fits what happened better, but I too doubt their existence, ability to kill Paddock and leave no trace or witnesses, and if that did happen I can&#39;t see the casino not taking credit. </p>
