    <div class="md"><p>This may be because I live in California, but, I know quite a few people in their 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s who think the same way. They cannot be reasoned with. Their go-to line is &quot;Free speech doesn&#39;t include hate speech.&quot;. Completely ignoring that anything someone doesn&#39;t like can be considered hate speech by someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt he&#39;s representative of his generation, but my brother thinks this way.  He believes climate change is the biggest threat facing the world today and people arguing that climate change isn&#39;t manmade should be imprisoned.  He considers antifa justified in their suppression of free speech.  He gets his news from Thom Hartmann, Democracy Now, and Vice, then follows it up with Bill Maher, Last Week Tonight, and the Late Show with Colbert.</p>

<p>He&#39;s typically rational, has studied history, read books on geopolitics, and seems to actively listen when I bring up differences of opinion but never changes his mind.</p>

<p>But I think his beliefs stem from a perspective that the government protects the people from private industry by forcing regulations beneficial for society at large and providing a safety net for the free market&#39;s losers so they don&#39;t starve to death.  And secondly, a belief that he stays informed and therefore knows better than any other non-expert.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. Only if it&#39;s a direct threat or call to violence should it be prosecuted, otherwise it&#39;s just a case of (insert any group) getting their feelings hurt and expecting the legal system to exact vengeance.

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t scream it at someone.  But you can scream it in general, even if they happen to be within earshot.  For example, if you&#39;re protesting people wearing fur on a street corner, you can scream how people who wear fur are murderers and terrible people, even as people wearing fur are walking by.  However, if you make eye contact and scream in someone&#39;s face, and then follow them for a few seconds while you scream at them some more, that&#39;s harassment and is not covered under the first amendment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think even hate speech should be protected. If the person&#39;s beliefs hold any weight other people will carry them on, if not, they will mostly die on their own. No legislation needed. The only things that shouldn&#39;t be protected, IMO, are inciting violence or yelling fire in a crowded theater when there is none.</p>

<p>Anything more is just stifling the free exchange of ideas under the premise of protecting peoples feelings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who cares if it is hate speech, people hate things/people/animals instead of yelling thats racist or homophobic why don&#39;t people ask why do you hate? Let them state their mind you might not like to hear what they have to say but damn let them say it. It will bring about a more civilized society that can express their opinion and create dialogue instead of discourse. If hate is to be answered with silence in any form. Silence of their words  or the silence of your own response then hate has won. You have allowed it to control the very society we live in.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no, that&#39;s terrifying! I know people a well, people I&#39;m close to and who are otherwise intelligent, who get angry with me if I defend the free speech of people whose opinions are (in my opinion) abhorrent. They get all uncomfortable and act like by defending the right of people to speak their mind I am agreeing with what they have to say. Fair enough if you want to dislike someone for saying this or that thing, that&#39;s normal. But it&#39;s scary how people have now been conditioned into thinking that being upset by some words someone said online takes precedence over the principle of free speech. Because it starts off with things like racism and homophobia, and then it extends to things like climate change, opinions of false flag events etc, which is dangerous for obvious reasons - if you crush people&#39;s right to disagree by saying it&#39;s &#39;offensive&#39; then you&#39;re giving only a tiny number of people a monopoly on truth.</p>

<p>This is the central issue.  The majority view government as benevolent and vitally necessary.  My own view is that any form of political or economic authority should always be assumed to be psychopathic, until explicitly proven otherwise.</p>

<p>Whether or not you view government as benevolent, will determine whether or not you consider its&#39; limitation necessary.</p>

<p>Millennials usually have no genuine understanding of reality.  That in itself is not the problem; the problem is that they insist on claiming otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Millennials have grown up in a scenario where relative freedom was something they could take for granted.  They have no living memory of the alternative; but I have a feeling that they are going to find out what said alternative feels like.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to consider free speech an unnecessary evil, if you&#39;ve never experienced a scenario where it doesn&#39;t exist.  As sick as it might sound, part of me is genuinely hoping that America becomes a true and incontrovertible fascist state, because the country is currently inhabited by a very large number of people, who desperately need direct, first hand personal experience as to why liberty is vitally important.</p>

<p>Let a few more Millennials experience combat boots and AKs crashing through their front doors in the middle of the night, and their opinions might start to change.  As long as that only happens to someone else, then they have the luxury of denial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even just 15 years ago you would never hear of such a conversation taking place in the US.  There is definitely a push to limit free speech.  I hate to sound cliche, but I think &quot;cultural Marxism&quot; is the cause.  This ideology was originally spread through colleges and universities.  Now its spread to other facets of American society.</p>

<p>The underlying philosophy, although not stated blatantly, is that we are all the same.  It doesn&#39;t matter what race or gender you are.  We&#39;re all equal.  No race or gender has general inherent weaknesses.  No race or gender has inherent strengths.  No individual has inherent weaknesses or strengths.  </p>

<p>If you strongly adhere to this philosophy, and have little respect for the value of the Constitution to begin with, then what is the point of allowing &quot;hate speech.&quot;  If you know for an absolute fact that it has zero truth, and serves no purpose, then why allow it?  Especially if you have no problem subverting the Constitution.</p>

<p>This is why people who are willing to make exceptions for the second amendment, are often also willing to make exceptions for the first amendment as well.  There is a belief that everything is relative.  A belief that violence is sometimes justified.  I believe it stems ultimately from the breakdown of morality within society.</p>

<p>In a society that believes that things like gender are relative, or that political violence is sometimes justified, then its clear there is no longer clear cut truths that exist.  The belief that &quot;the right to bear arms,&quot; or &quot;freedom of speech&quot; are relative as well, is the logical next step.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a particularly religious person myself in the traditional sense, but one can&#39;t help but notice the negative correlation between religion and Marxist philosophy.  Its clear that the two cannot coexist, which is why Communist countries try to eradicate religion.  </p>

<p>Religion teaches that there are certain things that are absolute truths.  Such as the idea that its always wrong to be violent.  Cultural Marxism teaches us that this is not an absolute truth.  Its usually wrong to be violent; unless its toward a Nazi.  </p>

<p>&quot;Who is a Nazi?&quot; of course is the million dollar question.  The answer is &quot;Whoever they believe it is.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember when President Obama, widely considered to have been a great president, gave a speech in which he said that most Americans no longer believe in the vision of the founding fathers? I don&#39;t know how strong the anti-free-speech movement is, but the cultural basis to support it has definitely been weakened over the past couple of decades.</p>

<p>Free speech is something I value highly. You should mot get in trouble with the law for saying anything, as long as it doesn&#39;t turn into harassment. However companies and businesses should have every right to restrict speech and fire employees who do not comply.</p>

<p>I.e. you camt call your coworker the n word and expect to keep your job.</p>
