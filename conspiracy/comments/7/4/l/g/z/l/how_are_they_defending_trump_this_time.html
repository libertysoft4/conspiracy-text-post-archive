The cell phone hack is going to be worse than any national security leak, and will probably reveal a nuclear level of illegal shit. Trump want to unleash a series of attacks so he can try some kind of martial law and suspend any transfers of power meaning he can’t be impeached. </p>

<p>Anybody who was thinking that and fell for that koolaid was/is simply doing it way wrong.</p>

<p>Pro tip:  The president doesn&#39;t run the country.  The corporate empire behind him is who and what tell him wtf to do - when to jump and not jump.  He just does what he&#39;s told or he and his family will end up like Kennedy.</p>

<p>This <del>country&#39;s</del> world&#39;s ran by truly evil figures.</p>

<p>Meh.  Who cares really?  Most won&#39;t admit they were wrong.  People don&#39;t like doing that - hurts their ego.  Most aren&#39;t evolved enough to take that step.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter.  Doesn&#39;t change what is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This shit should be more than even the dumbest among them can tolerate and defend.</p>

<p>Perhaps.</p>

<p>Again though, at the end of the day, anyone who thinks the president runs much of anything is simply doing it wrong.  Whether it&#39;s Trump or Clinton or <em>whoever</em>, THE PRESIDENT IS <em>NOT</em> IN CHARGE OF THE UNITED STATES.</p>

<p>Doesn’t change the fact that if trump can be taken out and if he lost 75% of his base he would not make it a full 4 year term. He is worse than a lot of alternatives just based on his retard rhetoric On Foreign and domestic issues alone. </p>

Or are you so warped away from that value and so caught up in the bad news that you&#39;re too fucking weak to grow a pair and realize your violent desires are fuelled by your discontent with the world. Focus on making it a little better, not acting like a savage cause you don&#39;t like the way things are. Things change here in humanity one way. With actions that reflect desires. If you want to replace the current abomination that refer to as society with something worse, then you need to recheck your values.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s hilarious. Just like every dumbass to walk the earth, your simply wrong. </p>

<p>Everything you&#39;ve said so far deems you as a rage filled simpleton who thinks it&#39;s necessary to beat down a person to your own low level in order to beat them in a pointless argument that&#39;s more important than life itself to you. Your doing nothing but making your own discontent with every aspect of who you are obvious. Every word you&#39;ve typed in this pissing match is absent hearted and fake, just like you. Which is why you resort to attempting to bring others happieness down so you can feel content with your miserable life. You&#39;re nothing but a textbook bully. And bullys are always miserable, self loathing, weak and lack integrity, just like you. You are the scum of society. If you died tomorrow, those you believe are your &#39;friends&#39; would be relieved that they don&#39;t have to entertain your parasitic existence anymore. </p>
