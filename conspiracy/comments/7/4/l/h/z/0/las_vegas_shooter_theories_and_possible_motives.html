<p>-- Possible Motives for Attack --</p>

<p>+Option 1: Single Shooter/Official Narrative: Paddock decided to shoot up a concert and then kill himself. This is more or less the official narrative, but it is still a possibility. The attack was clearly carefully planned; Paddock had been in his hotel for around a week with a room overlooking the concert. A new article has come out showing that Paddock had also booked a room overlooking Lollapalooza earlier this year. Whether that was a dry run or he simply backed down from pulling the trigger that day, or he had another reason for booking that hotel remains to be seen. Paddock was a pilot, though, which means he was psychologically analyzed and deemed to be stable enough to own 2 planes, which casts suspicion on the theory that he suddenly decided to kill a bunch of people.</p>

<p>+Option 2: Planned Attack with Multiple Shooters: This theory suggests that several people had worked together to coordinate the attack, Paddock may or may not have been one of them. He had most likely planned to survive and escape, but variations on this theory suggest he either couldn&#39;t live with his actions and committed suicide, or one of the other conspirators killed him and staged it to  look like a suicide to use as a diversion while they escaped </p>

<p>+Option 3: ISIS Attack/ISIS Inspired Attack: There were unconfirmed rumors that Paddock had pledged allegiance to ISIS months ago and shot up  the crowd as part of their ongoing global jihad; ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack 3 times. However, ISIS often claims attacks, even if they aren&#39;t responsible.</p>

<p>+Option 4: Government PsyOp: The US government somehow staged the attack as a front to push gun control laws on the US citizens. Variations on this theory suggest either a professional government sniper shot up the crowd and killed Paddock, leaving him to be the patsy, or that the entire event was staged and used crisis actors to play the role of victims.</p>

<p>+Option 5: Leaker Theory: This theory suggests Paddock had intended to leak classified intel about the government&#39;s dealings with terror cells or cartel groups, and the government staged the attack to destroy his credibility preemptively in case any of his intel was leaked, as well as eliminate him.</p>

<p>+Option 6: Arms Deal Gone Bad: This theory is that Paddock had brought the guns to his room as an attempt to sell them to ISIS, the cartel, the mafia, or another crime group, and the people he was meeting with decided to kill him and shoot up the crowd. There isn&#39;t a clear motive why someone who felt they had been double-crossed by Paddock would shoot up the crowd though, instead of just killing him, unless it was ISIS; however, if it was ISIS, they would likely have stayed and been martyrs in the attack, rather than fleeing the scene.</p>

<p>+Option 7: Antifa: The concert was a country music concert; it is possible that if Paddock had ties to Antifa, he could have been radicalized into believing that many of the people in attendance were Trump voters who deserved to be eliminated.</p>

<p>+Option 8: Saudis: Saudis own the 4 Seasons (floors 35-39) of the hotel, meaning it&#39;s possible that the guns were being brought down to his room by the Saudis who were selling them to him, rather than him bringing them up.

<p>+Former Neighbor Says Paddock May Have Been a Patsy: 
(<a href="https://michaelsavage.com/2017/10/02/audio-neighbor-of-shooter-tells-savage-he-did-not-do-it/">https://michaelsavage.com/2017/10/02/audio-neighbor-of-shooter-tells-savage-he-did-not-do-it/</a>)</p>

<p>+No footage released yet of  Paddock bringing the bags/guns/ammo into his room</p>

<p>-- Other Theories --</p>

<p>+Heist Theory: A Theory I&#39;ve seen floating around the web is the idea that the shooting was a diversion while a heist was going on in the Mandalay Bay Casino or another nearby casino, suggesting that, by keeping the  people and police busy with the shooting, a heist could go on unhindered in the background. There isn&#39;t really any evidence to support this other that the fact that the shooting took place in a Vegas casino</p>

<p>+Kidnapped Girlfriend/Ransom Theory: Theory that ISIS or some other group kidnapped his girlfirend while she was in the Philippines, and used her to force Paddock to commit the shooting. There isn&#39;t really any evidence to this, especially considering his girlfriend is now back in the US and being questioned by the FBI.</p>

<p>+Hangover Theory: I don&#39;t know if this is connected at all (almost certainly not connected) but I&#39;m trying to list all possible connections and theories here. Anyways, in the 2009 film The Hangover, the opening credits show the Mandalay Bay Casino, around the 32nd floor, where Paddock&#39;s room was. During this shot, the lyrics of the song playing are &quot;got a number 13 tattooed on my neck&quot;. This has caught some peoples&#39; attention because the only known photo of Paddock appears to show him with a number 13 on his neck. Probably an anomalous coincidence, but I want to include every idea I&#39;ve heard here. </p>

<p>--Theories and Additions from Comments--</p>

<ul>
<li><p>u/kaptenhefty : Maybe add, Conservative and studied arguments for his right to own weapons under the US constitution.
New article with friend of Paddock tells about his love for the constitution, he is conservative and extremely intelligent
(<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-intelligent-gambler-gun-rights">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock-intelligent-gambler-gun-rights</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>u/herecomesantifa : Trump is peddling a mentally ill narrative.
He ordered the attack as a distraction to the cell phone hack that is going to be the worst national security leak ever and likely the end of the trump admin. He plans to hold onto the presidency by ordering more attacks and declaring martial law and a suspension of any transfers of power by executive order.</p></li>
<li><p>u/Facts_About_Cats :  None of those options is plausible to me. The only plausible explanation I&#39;ve been able to come up with is, they were sending a warning to Trump, that they can easily assassinate him if they want to.</p></li>
<li><p>u/Aardopossadillo : The mike savage interview has been taken down. here is a backup. You probably want to download the audio whoever can do it.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171003012914/https://michaelsavage.com/2017/10/02/audio-neighbor-of-shooter-tells-savage-he-did-not-do-it/">https://web.archive.org/web/20171003012914/https://michaelsavage.com/2017/10/02/audio-neighbor-of-shooter-tells-savage-he-did-not-do-it/</a></p></li>
<li><p>u/dreammanalishi : You should include the incident list from that night which incontrovertibly proves multiple gunmen in different casinos, listing 3 SWAT responses to the NYNY and a couple other casinos.
This is why a heist could have happened. One end of the Strip was complete chaos, while the other side was &#39;quiet.&#39; Casinos quash the media on murders, rapes, suicides and robberies. They don&#39;t want people to know how often these things happen.
Either way, the incident list proves the media is lying and it corroborated what was being heard on police scanners.</p></li>

<p>The fact that other casinos had shooters that weren&#39;t reported is the most obvious evidence. Many others on this sub have dug into the details of the concert shooting to show that this could only be the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin communis, &quot;common, universal&quot;)[1][2] is the philosophical, social, political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money[3][4] and the state.[</p>

<p>I would say communism would be the end goal of socialism, and has never been achieved anywhere as of yet. The proletariat never common ownership, the State always ends up owning everything.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that is a good answer.  I have had this discussion with people before, and I do not understand why the ruling party in China is called The Communist Party of China.  It is like they misnamed themselves, or it is what the strive to be.  </p>

<p>The means of production has essentially been removed from the US.  We are more like an oligarchy. Hopefully, we can change this pretty soon.  No wonder our debt is $20T.  We are  not producing as much as we used to.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is exactly right. Communist China had their revolution with Chairman Mao in the 1950&#39;s. It was an adapted form of Stalinism for Chinese culture. The peasants actually lived worse under the feudal system than they did under Mao, but Mao, being a Stalinist, loved to persecute heretics. </p>

<p>Mao died and the next leader wanted to open China up to trade on the global market. This was around the time of Nixon. Deals were made, and in the Clinton days after NAFTA, more and more of our small goods manufacturing was shipped there because the labor was cheaper than Mexico. They have used this to their advantage, and gradually positioned themselves as a World Power. </p>

<p>They are ready for hegemony and to expand. The U.S. owes China so much money, they have a lot of leverage over us with trade.</p>

<p>If we could produce here and export, we could recoup some of our losses. A lot of our debt comes from the Iraq war. There was a surplus when Bush took office, and we ended up with a global Recession when he left. Obama brought very little of the changes people were hoping for economically.</p>

<p>We are most assuredly an oligarchy at this point. Many major countries are. After the recession (a Depression, in all honesty), all of the wealth flowed upwards and became more concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. The average man in the street isn&#39;t too happy about being lorded over by kleptocratic rulers, so hence, the increasing State power and control. This is our form of government:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to clarify, my understanding was he was no longer cleared to fly due to blood pressure issues and being unable to take the medication to control it because of allergies? I thought he sold his planes over a decade ago?</p>

<p>Also, the Aussie calling him conservative I believe does not mean it in the political sense, he means it in the sense of his personality, guarded and reserved. It fits the context of the quote most importantly, but also an Australian would be more likely to call him republican if he meant it politically. Source : am Kiwi, deal with Aussies every day.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s likely he thought he could cause those fuel tanks to explode and the authorities think it were a bomb, leading rise to thoughts there could be more and letting him escape in the chaos - only to attack somewhere else from his car and blow that up with the tannerite in a final big boom for maximum body count. I think the cops showed up earlier than he anticipated, or his escape route got cut off, or he injured himself and realised he couldn&#39;t finish it.</p>

<p>Curiously, as i havent studied the photos, but is there evidence which gun he used to top himself? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I have a pretty out there theory about the Las Vegas murder&#39;s motive. I have read rumors about &quot;snuff film&quot; type streams existing on the dark web. Is it possible that this was some kind of ultimate gambling scenario that was streamed to the dark web? He was a high roller so he got off on the rush of risk taking. It is believed he planned to escape. He had cameras monitoring the hallway, the door, but also unexplainably a camera monitoring himself in the room. The cameras however were not recording. Could they have been used for streaming? A mysterious note with numbers was found in his room, IP addresses, or something? I also don&#39;t really buy his girlfriends alibi, given the testimony of everyone else who came in contact with the murderer he was a standoffish dick, she would have certainly been aware of that and I think an honest person would try to compensate for it in some way in their testimony. Either she was extremely emotionally manipulated or there is something dubious in her testimony.</p>
