<p>I have a B.A. in Sociology. </p>

<p>OP said that he either gets patronized or berated for posting his wild theories.  As I interpret it (because who else is going to interpret it for me), that covers the full spectrum of possible responses to something posted that is, for all purposes, insane.  It leaves no room for dissent.</p>

<p>In effect, he wants this to be a “safe space” for all ideas, regardless of how little justification there is for even having the idea in the first place.  I, on the other her hand, feel the total opposite.</p>

<p>Maybe you should try to understand to conversation taking place before you chime in?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So...is it ok to point out the flaws of a proposed theory if it&#39;s done in a nice/civil way? The way I&#39;m reading some of the stuff in this thread, it sounds like some folks would like to be able to discuss theories unopposed - which, I get: it&#39;s fun and exciting to think up conspiracy theories. If that&#39;s the goal of this sub, so be it. </p>

<p>Further, it&#39;s not necessarily a given that everyone knows the MSM message on a topic. Even if there&#39;s information available from the MSM, that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ve all brought ourselves up to speed on it. I think it&#39;s especially important to be able to discuss MSM messages here so as to maintain a level of skepticism of that message - particularly when an event continues to evolve (such as the Vegas shooting).</p>

<p>If this is going to be a safe space for conspiracy theorists then that&#39;s cool - I think that&#39;s good for those of us who would like to be able to test the merits of a specific theory to know so as to not offend. If, however, this sub and its contributors are able to stomach criticism/skepticism of ideas, I think it&#39;s worth discussing how we can do so with tact and civility. </p>

<p>(To clarify, I&#39;m not suggesting you hold any specific views on the matter so I hope I don&#39;t come across as suggesting you do by asking questions.)</p>

<p>Definitely!  That&#39;s the main reason that I&#39;ve said that this subreddit is a battleground for ideologues.  The election was when I started to see the subreddit&#39;s quality decline, but when Pizzagate was the hot topic, discourse started to degrade exponentially.  Please don&#39;t take my last statement as a slam against all who espouse the PG conspiracy as there were several rational folks that I talked with.  It did, however, fuel what I view to be one of the cancers to discourse;  Accusing people of shilling without addressing the content of their post.  Critical thinking and the Socratic Method will do more to battle shills than blind accusations, in my opinion.</p>

<p>So...is it ok to point out the flaws of a proposed theory if it&#39;s done in a nice/civil way? </p>

<p>Yes, in my opinion this is exactly how things should be done. But frequently this is not done in this manner. Obviously people can be critical of a conspiracy theory, but they should do in a civil and kind manner, realizing there is a human being on the other side of that computer screen. </p>

<p>That is also the only way we can get good conversations, snarky comments, insults, berating....none of that leads to anywhere.</p>

<p>Actually, no they don&#39;t. People are still right now posting about the &quot;suicide note&quot;, even though they stated in a press conference yesterday that it wasn&#39;t a suicide note, but they couldn&#39;t say what it was.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much info that we can&#39;t expect everyone to know it. Perhaps you knew about the note, perhaps not.. someone will likely read this that didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I think the problem isn&#39;t someone bring smug trying to prove someone wrong, I think the problem is that people don&#39;t like being proven wrong. But you will <strong>never</strong> get any form of truth, by wanting something to be true, that isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Those people who who theories that ar debunkable will eventually get debunked, and respectfully so. But if they aren&#39;t given the space to get debunked and people are berated everytime because they don&#39;t align with the MSM then it creates more confusion. This is a classic case of mudying the water.</p>

<p>At this point I would rather hear a theory someone has come up with and try to analyze it rather than re-hearing the MAN. Isn&#39;t there other subs to discuss the official narrative?

<p>This is a perfect example of paranoid behavior.  </p>

<p>You’re doing everything but outright calling me a shill because I make the <strong>controversial</strong> statement that the theories discussed in this forum should at least be grounded in reality.thats it.  Just one shred of reality and I’m cool.  Grand claims require grand evidence.  This used to be a great place full of great minds.  Now all the top threads are just pages of retarded shit that is s total waste of time because it’s people just speculating and posting whatever crazy thought pops into their head with no evidence whatsoever to support even thinking that in the first place.</p>

<p>Believe in reptilians?  Cool, there’s at least cave drawings and shit that look like lizard people?</p>

<p>But to say something like (hypothetical example they I saw somewhere) “the Las Vegas shooter was dead days before the shooting took place”.  Well there’s currently no evidence whatsoever to support something like that.  So I would consider something like that should be down voted and ridiculed into oblivion.</p>

<p>If someone were working to discredit this place, that’s EXACTLY what it would look like.   </p>

<p>Of course we need to analyse what the media are saying and take clues from every breadcrumb they leave us but that doesn’t mean we should take what they say as gospel and repeat it hear like it’s fact and should be believed above any other theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is it <em>only</em> for discussing alternatives?  I&#39;m fairly sure it says conspiracy as the name of the sub, not &quot;AlternativeConspiracies&quot;.  If there is a conspiracy in the mainstream news, it should absolutely fit within the confines of this sub.  People should be encouraged to discuss the merits of it, the problems inherent in it, and also whether or not there&#39;s a conspiracy behind the conspiracy so to speak.  There&#39;s also nothing in the sidebar, last I checked, that is limiting the scope of discussion here at all.</p>

<p>I fully understand your reasoning behind the statement, I just disagree because I feel this sub should be as welcoming as possible to all people who have a questioning mind.  The No True Scotsman stuff gets used around here, by some and not all, to try and limit discussion and participation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there&#39;s a conspiracy being discussed in the MSM, it&#39;s still a conspiracy.  We&#39;ll likely talk about it here from multiple angles, which may or may not agree with the MSM conclusions, but it should still be fair game.  As far as articles go, your choice is whether or not you consider this to be a news forum at all.  If current articles involving/discussing current conspiracies are acceptable, then all sources of current articles should be welcome.  If you don&#39;t want this to be a news forum, then everything should be off-limits.  Either no censorship or total blackout, not some biased censorship where we pick and choose the narratives so people visiting here only get that version of events.  Let&#39;s keep it transparent because people here read the comments on an article, so there&#39;s plenty of opportunity to educate them on the lies they might be seeing.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;d love a flair system for posts so I could filter out topics I&#39;m just not interested in.  I get your sentiment and I&#39;ve echoed similar to it before, but I just disagree with the word &quot;specifically&quot;.</p>

The fact that he left a note and it “isn’t a suicide note” but they won’t tell us what it said.  That he had 20 guns and didn’t use most of them.  If someone said, what if it was an arms deal that went south, I wouldn’t dismiss that, because hey it’s at least remotely supported by something.  Clearly I don’t reject conspiracy theories.  I just have a brain and can’t turn it off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re putting words in my mouth like he was. I never said we should only talk about what&#39;s proven, that would defeat the entire purpose of discussing conspiracies. </p>

<p>He claimed that a theory did not need to be provable. That&#39;s just flat out incorrect, and it has nothing to do with mine or yours or his idea of truth. Provable just means that, hypothetically, something would be able to be proven. It doesn&#39;t mean we did prove it, or that it&#39;s likely to be proven, or that it&#39;s not really fucking difficult to prove. It just means that it CAN somehow be proven. </p>

<p>If he didn&#39;t mean provable in the literal sense, then that&#39;s his poor choice of words, not mine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You called him an idiot and reacted, I pointed out that the behavior is what OP is discussing. </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t claim that, he asked what made you the authority over what is provable and worth discussing when you cannot prove or disprove a theory involving a government conspiracy, you can speculate, use media, have an eyewitness report but it&#39;s very difficult to unequivocally prove or disprove a conspiracy based on the available information since it will be disputed all the way until it is proven (like all major conspiracies). That&#39;s just the nature of conspiracy theories  </p>

<p>Your position is soley on what is provable, but have you ever actually tried to find proof in favor of a conspiracy theory or just to devalue it based on your preconceived notions of what you can personally prove based on your position?</p>

<p>Sorry you have difficulty discussing a subject without using insults to belittle others to prove your point, but it isn&#39;t my fault you&#39;ve managed to encapsulate exactly what OP was discussing in one of the top comment chains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Provable has nothing to do with someone being able to PERSONALLY prove it. A government conspiracy is certainly provable, no matter how unlikely it is. It CAN be proven, even if it won&#39;t ever be. Disputing it is irrelevant. </p>

<p>Example: a theory that bigfoot exists is provable. If bigfoot exists, it is possible to capture it or capture overwhelming evidence of its existence and use it to show people that it exists. Nobody has ever done that, so most people assume it doesn&#39;t exist. Even if it does exist, it&#39;s quite possible that nobody will ever be able to prove its existence. But, if someone were to find strong evidence in favor of the existence of bigfoot, they could formulate a theory about its existence that is provable. </p>

<p>Opposite example: the existence of god is not provable. You can believe in god or believe that god doesn&#39;t exist, and one will be correct and one will be incorrect, but you can never prove or disprove it. If someone were to base their theory around divine intervention, it would be a waste of time to discuss it, because it is inherently not something that could ever be proven or disproven. Therefore, it is not a theory, it is simply a belief. </p>

<p>Are you trying to make a statement over the difference between faith and what is proven or provable?</p>

<p>It reads as if you&#39;re making the assumption that his theories would be belief since he had no proof, which doesn&#39;t mean that it can&#39;t be provable or worth discussing in an attempt to find proof. Which you called him an idiot for suggesting and questioning that.</p>

<p>Available evidence is the key.  Very often the evidence required to actually prove a theory is not available, especially when we are talking about an unaccountable government which lies as a matter of convenience, and uses a compartmentalized classification system in order to mitigate the damage of information getting exposed to public scrutiny.  I mean heck, the land of the free has secret laws, secret courts and secret interpretations.  The truth may be out there, but it is very difficult to prove given our shared reality.</p>

<p>Most users are more primed to argue thanks to the brigades and nonsense this sub has gone through this year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My recommendation would be to attempt as best as you can to frame your question in a form that cannot be interpreted as an attack.</p>

<p>Just saying &quot;Do you have a source for that?&quot; alone can very easily be interpreted as an attack by many people, even though it&#39;s a perfectly valid question. In my experience, this is because it is more often an opener from someone hell bent on debunking what you have to say rather than a show of genuine interest.</p>

<p>Something as simple as &quot;Fascinating. Do you have a source? I&#39;d like verify for myself and maybe dig a little deeper.&quot; can make a world of difference in terms of the sort of response you get.</p>

<p>Frankly, you&#39;re right, a lot of people that come here are depressive, irritable people, and it doesn&#39;t take much to give them an excuse to get snappy. Source: myself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been so many people recently who come here with the view that the maisntream media narrative is the truth, and that because the media said it, that automatically gives it one million credibility points, even if what the media is saying has no evidence. For example, the one shooter or multiple shooters theory. Mainstream says one shooter, despite the footage, the many eye witness and victim accounts of multiple shooters and the scanner audio from when it was happening with police saying there were multiple shooters. For some reason this sub is now full of people who think that because the media said there&#39;s one shooter, all that evidence is nothing compared to the zero evidence and simple outright statement of a narrative by the media. Same people then spend ages trying to condescendingly tell people who are thinking about different possibilities that they are mentally ill and require a psychiatrist. It&#39;s people like that who are totally annoying, disrespectful and bringing down the quality of the sub. Critical thinking and questions and suggestions and pointing out holes in a theory is good, but that only comes from people who are actually engaging and taking it seriously, not the people who are still completely wrapped up in the mainstream lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen people here saying  &quot;there was only one shooter because the media says so&quot; but I <em>have</em> seen them point out that the footage (audio or video) doesn&#39;t definitively show multiple shooters, and we know from past events that police and witnesses <em>often</em> get confused about how many shooters there are, and in hindsight, there&#39;s very little physical evidence that supports the theory of multiple shooters, i.e. bullet holes or casings in places where they couldn&#39;t physically be, other video, ballistic, or audio evidence that is impossible to explain without multiple shooters, etc. Could there have been multiple shooters? Sure, but a reasonable evaluation of the available information combined with what we know about the relability of eyewitness statements makes the single shooter theory more plausible. Occam&#39;s razor and all that. It <em>is</em> possible for the official narrative to be correct , and to dismiss that possiblity is just as close-minded as to say that the official narrative is <em>always</em> correct.  </p>

So when anything flat earth gets posted here, you&#39;ll see a sea of comments calling OP an idiot. When anything gets posted here about Trump, you&#39;ll get a sea of comments defending him and calling the news fake. There&#39;s a political battle going on here.

<p>It is one thing to disagree.  It is something entirely different to mock, denigrate, and hold up any official explanation as gospel, especially considering how often the official explanation is found to be flawed at best.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So when anything flat earth gets posted here, you&#39;ll see a sea of comments calling OP an idiot. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have literally been high enough in the air with the right perspective where I could actually see the curve of the earth, so to me there is no debate.  Guess what, I will never go into a post on flat earth theory because it doesn&#39;t interest me, and I have no need or want to ruin someone elses&#39; discussion, in spite of my very strong beliefs on the subject. </p>

<p>That tends to be the difference between a contrarian, and a shill.</p>

<p>But what happens when you see flat earth level nonsense on something you are interested in? 80% of the stuff from the Vegas shooter in the first 2 days was derived from personal feeling or shit posted by infowars or 4chan. &quot;Alex Jones said a false flag was happening this week!&quot;  </p>

<p>So what is how I respond to that?  Why do you care what others are discussing.  What is it to you?  Some people post opinions and try to engage in discussion.  Others try to sway opinions one way or the other.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are free to call things out, but we ask you do so in a constructive manner.  You will always catch more flies with honey than vinegar, so if you goal is to win a convert, then be mindful of that fact.  Suggesting someone is a paranoid maniac because they are entertaining a thought you happen to find absurd is kind of what we are talking about.</p>

<p>I appreciate your opinion, but f you don&#39;t like it there are other subs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So wait.  Feel free.  Others have a right to engage now.  Trying to tell others how to exercise their right to free speech is pretty much an on starter for all but the authoritarians among us.</p>

<p>I have no problem with doubters.  Doubters are an essential element to testing a particular theory.  However, when those doubters engage in JTRIG tactics then they become something else imho, something we can definitely do without.</p>

I entertain conspiracies casually, mostly in the pursuit of knowing all the facts about things that interest me, or trying to make sense of something that shocks or hurts me.

<p>a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something, especially one based on general principles independent of the thing to be explained.</p>

<p>It says nothing of basing it on verifiable data points. It says it tends to be based on general principals. A lot of these conspiracy theories are based on general principles that we as members of society are accustomed to and aware of. Such as greed, lying, and the power of money.</p>

<p>Anyone can taste righteous indignation when they are arguing for the mainstream narrative of events against a group of conspiracy theorist and not realize how ridiculous that crusade is.

<p>If your position is rock solid concrete, then what purpose is coming into a conspiracy subreddit to cause drama unless you believe that conspiracy theories are so ignorant that they must be trolled and punished for their childish behavior so that they&#39;ll learn to not question the status quo and become happy meme sharing, social media using, time wasting members of society stepping out of the way to allow the elites to run things, because why bother when I have my new iPhone X with facial recognition emojis and tinder.</p>

<p>That shady-as-hell medical examiner actually claimed at a press conference the next day that he made the decision to not allow any paramedics into the school and instead declare all the kids dead within 9 minutes, leaving all the bodies in pools of their own blood, bleeding out onto the floor and stiffening up with rigor mortis all morning, afternoon, and night so that his team could sneak them out under the cover of darkness into secret vehicles when nobody was looking at midnight.

They were rushing around with the people who were just shot, loading them into ambulances and the backs of pickup trucks as fast as they could.  There wasn&#39;t a single dead or dying person that came out of that building.  The paramedics weren&#39;t even ALLOWED inside.  The parents were never allowed to see their children and every one o of them were okay with that.  You couldn&#39;t find one parent in a thousand that wouldn&#39;t demand to see their child, even if they were dead or shot up, yet every single one of these crisis actors were fine with it.

    <div class="md"><p>Vegas was an open air situation with thousands of bystanders but once the scene was secured, obviously dead bodies were left in situ. AMR staff technically broke the rules by even attempting to get to patients when there was still an active shooter threat. In Sandy Hook, most of the wounded were walking wounded and evacuated by police, the seriously injured were quickly taken out by police with medical training and delivered to the paramedics. There was zero reason to let non LEO go into the building when they didn&#39;t know if it was secure and by the time it was secure, the wounded were already evacuated and as I pointed out, there is no point in moving dead bodies and disrupting a crime scene.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know man.  I think the &quot;parents&quot; are actors.  Again, this isn&#39;t an outrageous claim.  It has been proven to occur before.  Have you watched the parent interviews critically?  If not, do so.</p>

<p>Also, some of the details on Lanza make zero sense.  </p>

<p>For instance, he wouldn&#39;t touch door knobs because they were metal, he was so intolerant of noises that he couldn&#39;t even bare the sound of his mom walking on the floor in heels, and he was so uncoordinated that he couldn&#39;t tie his own shoes.  </p>

<p>Those are all facts:<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say that. In fact I corrected the guy in another comment saying that we don&#39;t know that it hit the hard drive, only the tower itself. And sure it&#39;s not the easiest way to destroy evidence, but it&#39;s an efficient way to get the public to associate &quot;pizzagate&quot; with &quot;crazy man shoots up family restaurant&quot; if you&#39;re in cahoots with media, like JA is. If they&#39;ve got something to hide then they&#39;re probably gonna put in effort to making sure the narrative is in their favour with the resources they have at their disposal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a ridiculous argument that&#39;s supposed to make you feel bad. Been hearing it for years. So many Americans take the questioning of the narrative as a personal attack on themselves, as if even the craziest of us who do stupid shit make a difference towards what we&#39;re discussing. Ignorance under the guise of patriotism. </p>

<p>In a perfect world, everybody would be discussing these things regardless of their merit. Everyone. The atrocities of governments long before the 20th century alone should be enough to ingrain that doubt in us. Too much has been proven, admitted to, and apologized for to not question everything. There are idiots on both sides - that&#39;s a people thing, not a theorist/skeptic thing. </p>

<p>I say all of this so that you have some perspective when i say that anybody can talk about any conspiracy they want here. I dont know what it is like to lose a child, but today marks the 10 year anniversary of losing my dad, so i understand how it can be a touchy subject.</p>

<p>People died. I know it. You know it, but some are convinced there were no deaths. Its a dumb theory and there is very little backing it up, but this is the place to discuss it because above everything else we try to look at things objectively and question everything here without letting our emotions cloud judgement. Im sorry for anyone who is hurt by ignorant people who immediately claim nobody died, but we will more than likely set them straight pretty quickly, and if we cant then that would mean there is more to look at concerning that theory.</p>

<p>No one should be 100% certain that they know the truth behind any of the shit we see here. And no one should believe their own bullshit or the bullshit of others. Always keep in mind the possibility that you might be wrong about everything, and be open to other perspectives. The main issue I see here is dogmatism/100% certitude towards theories.

<p>It all depends on how much evidence there is.  It is fine to be certain of something if there is evidence to support your conclusion.  </p>

<p>The problem is when people claim to be certain in the absence of evidence.  In those instances speculating on possibilities is perfectly reasonable - certainty is not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve travelled or experienced war.  What we saw in Las Vegas is a single instance of something that becomes a fact of daily life in a war zone.  59 civilians die in a &quot;single airstrike&quot; in other countries.</p>

<p>Look, man, this shook me too.  For about 3 minutes.  Then I remembered traveling to places like Sarajevo where machine gun fire still traces across the fronts of office and apartment buildings.  Where artillery holes adorn skyscrapers.  The little flower-like scoured-out patterns in sidewalks they call &quot;Sarajevo Roses&quot; that mark grenade explosions.  That world is what our arms hold at bay.</p>

<p>We are one of the oldest governments on the planet.  We survived a civil war.  These feats are due to the fact that <em>we hold our government fucking accountable!</em>  They answer to <em>We The People</em> and if they ever refuse, they&#39;ll answer to a bullet.</p>

<p>Our right to self defense is how we stop another Holocaust.  How we stop a Holodomir.  59 people dead is a bloody nightmare.  How about 59 million dead?</p>

<p>Yet we live in a society in process of collapse.  Warlords will multiple.  Violence will metastasize.  If guns are not available, it will be bombs or poison or bacteria or any number of other ways to slaughter innocents.  So prepare yourself for what comes next.  And for God&#39;s sake, don&#39;t give up your guns, else you&#39;re just meat for someone else&#39;s fire.</p>

I&#39;ve seen what it does to people.  It takes every bit of joy out of their face and body.  The one thing all those Sandy Hook parents had in common was they all were laughing joyfully during interviews, may of them literally the very next day after their child was supposedly murdered in the scariest, most heinous way.  If that were normal, I wouldn&#39;t have said anything about it, but I happen to know it isn&#39;t normal because I&#39;ve seen grieving parents hundreds of times.  Besides that, nobody saw any dead or dying children. In fact there were only a small handful of children (1 classroom&#39;s worth at the most) ever to be seen anywhere near that place that day.  I was watching live along with everyone else. Sandy Hook was a Hoax.</p>

Not a single dead or dying child came out of that building.  In fact, there were only a handful of children to be seen anywhere.   I watched a medical examiner tell us the day afterwards that he made the decision to not allow any paramedics into the school and instead declare all the kids dead within 9 minutes, leaving all the bodies in pools of their own blood, bleeding out onto the floor and stiffening up with rigor mortis all morning, afternoon, and night so that his team could sneak them out under the cover of darkness into secret vehicles when nobody was looking at midnight. Give me a break. Paramedics would have rushed all those bodies right out onto the empty color-coordinated triage mats (they had one for deceased bodies too, ya know) and into vans and medical helicopters to rush them to the hospital--dead OR alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can provide evidence which supports your theory.  You can tell from the context of his reply that he is misusing the term proof when he means evidence.  A common mistake.  You think you’re being superior intellectually but in reality you’re jsut being pedantic.  </p>

<p>Many of us are arguing that you have a responsibility to assess the value/credibility of the information you use to formulate an opinion about something.  If you disagree with that then I don’t know what to tell you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with you, however it is not uncommon for people/tourists around here to respond to evidence-supported educated hypotheses with condescending requests for &quot;proof&quot;. </p>

<p>Hence my answer.</p>

<p>In my experience the probability of this happening is proportional to two dependent variables: 1) the validity of the evidence and 2) the &quot;identity parameter&quot; it entails. This is explained by cognitive dissonance, as <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/71qi7q/what_i_learned_from_trolling_rtopmindsofreddit/dndc84b/">I tried to illustrate here.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still don&#39;t seem to be understanding how the English language works. Words convey meaning. Sometimes you use them to convey meaning beyond their literal meaning. So you use figurative speech, hyperbole, metaphors, or allegories etc.  Doing so and trying to pass off such a statement as literally true would be lying. Doing so in a manner designed to make clear the figurative meaning, such as if someone said something sarcastically but with a tone that conveys sarcasm, is just called speaking in English.</p>

<p>Did you miss that I was speaking figuratively or not? Because if you did miss it then that&#39;s a whole different barrel of fish. And if you didn&#39;t miss my actual meaning, which seems more likely, asking for a literal Obama Vampire Theory post would be a deliberately combative and misleading way to try to frame a response I think. One in line with your choice to immediately devolve into vitriol and name calling.</p>

<p>In any event, the topic calls for tolerance of conspiracies and understanding of what this sub is about. I was trying to state my opinion that I agree, but supporting respectful questioning of a theory, or disagreement, must also be encouraged. Disagreement and requests for sources on topics is part of the process of fact finding. It is contributing to the search for knowledge and how bad information is winnowed out. If people don&#39;t support that process and instead call downvoting or questioning a theory brigading/disrespect  then this place will devolved into <a href="/r/conspiracyshowerthoughts">/r/conspiracyshowerthoughts</a>. </p>

<p>(obviously to some extend disrespect/brigading does occur...where could we find someone disrespectful I wonder?... but usually when I see the terms used around here it&#39;s because people are upset not everyone agrees with them).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great. And I have no problem with that. Respectful but diligent questioning is exactly what should be encouraged.  (Joe Rogan is a great example of someone who questions and disagree with many of his guests, but does so in a way that allows people to continue discussing the issue and learning from each other.) (Also please forgive formatting issues I have no idea what this post will look like.)  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what would be sliding (I assume this means scamming or something similar?) the sub-reddit given my only real point is that real feedback from real people, as long as it’s respectful, needs to be encouraged. And sometimes that feedback is going to be negative in the sense that it questions the op or asks for sources and that is a good thing. That is how learning happens. Nobody learns anything in a room full of people who agree. This is true regardless of the brigading comment so I kind of regret including that comment though I do stand by it.  (and support it below).  </p>

<p>The other thing I want to point out is that the drama surrounding this sub-reddit’s temporary swap to contest mode is 100% part of the issue I am talking about. It is an attempt to equalize the validity of comments regardless of any support they have and allow weak positions to avoid answering obvious questions. I believe it is a perfect example of some members of this community trying to hide from mostly real feedback by pretending it is fake for their own ego’s sake. (They want to assume people criticizing them are not be real for obvious psychological reasons).  </p>

<p>You can see certain mods admit they have taken actions to stop brigading because they “feel” like it is appropriate. Not because of evidence. What posts do they feel this way about? I bet it’s whichever ones disagree with them. (There’s more discussion to read about on this topic out there but this is a start, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/6spwi9/another_day_another_drama_at_rconspiracy_about/">https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/6spwi9/another_day_another_drama_at_rconspiracy_about/</a> )  </p>

<p>Anyway, here are some low hanging fruit examples of people claiming brigading just because they’re told they’re wrong that were easy to find and relatively recent. A lot of this takes place in comments and I’m not sure if there’s an easy way to look through those as opposed to title searches, but here’s a quick title search:  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6th4wf/rmusic_is_currently_being_brigaded_every_top_post/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6th4wf/rmusic_is_currently_being_brigaded_every_top_post/</a> (He doesn’t like the music being upvoted on rmusic so…. Must be antifa brigading.)  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6u4gh4/mods_help_conspiracy_is_being_brigaded_like_crazy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6u4gh4/mods_help_conspiracy_is_being_brigaded_like_crazy/</a>  (Subreddit is being brigaded because new posts, apparently largely his, are downvoted).  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6q1n3t/brigaded_on_legal_advice_asking_about_illuminati/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6q1n3t/brigaded_on_legal_advice_asking_about_illuminati/</a> (Thinks down votes mean illuminati are brigading his posts about them).  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6oupcb/are_the_mods_going_to_do_anything_about_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6oupcb/are_the_mods_going_to_do_anything_about_the/</a> (Thread started to argue about this topic in the comments. There are more. This has been a super common thing to discuss over the last year so I’m surprised you haven’t seen it even if you disagree with it.)  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ybxog/cia_threads_now_filled_with_rpolitics_shills/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ybxog/cia_threads_now_filled_with_rpolitics_shills/</a> (people should be banned if they say something nice about the CIA. Calling someone a shill is the same as saying they’re brigading you for my purposes. IE. claiming someone’s opinion is not legitimate based on  mere disagreement.)  </p>

<p>On a final note, I would just say I absolutely do believe there are paid shills on social media. Brigading does happen. But it is important not to jump to that conclusion about someone just because they disagree with you because once it’s said the conversation is over. Many shills are probably paid to do just that, prevent meaningful conversation between disparate groups. </p>

<p>Do you think that it&#39;s possible that selection bias is colouring your view of the situation?  I ask because, while I have seen people use random ad hominem attacks and pejoratives, I&#39;ve not really seen that frequently.  If you&#39;re referring to personal attacks and shill accusations without addressing a single point in a post, then I could see where you&#39;re coming from.</p>

<p>The reason that I differentiate between the two examples is that usually those who take issue with people asking them for evidence of a claim seem to take that as a personal attack.  Ironically, they&#39;re often the ones who&#39;re quick to ignore information and call a user a shill.</p>

I think a lot of people new to the sub see people asking questions and instead of viewing it as a discussion they view it as what the rest of reddit is, a circle jerk, and assume that everyone here has their mind made up. That&#39;s not, from what I&#39;ve seen, what this sub is about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing that&#39;s hard in debates is when the opposing argument is rooted into the person&#39;s morality and their view of the world. That&#39;s not something easy to persuade someone from. And it&#39;s an exercise in futility to try. For example, the prolife/prochoice debate : pro life people literally view abortion as murder. End of story. It&#39;d be hard to justify murder to anybody. That was one of my biggest concession/rebuttal issues. I think that&#39;s why it&#39;s like a debate 101 topic. </p>

<p>Not necessarily.  Maybe for you, but I disagree that that is the point of this sub.  Some people actually believe things they post here, with conviction.  They aren’t just here to exercise their brain.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Aside from the fact that in a lot of the shit threads I see, political bias is clearly the reason why illogical conclusion are jumped to, you really need to speak for yourself.</p>

<p>You’re basically saying that the concept of truth, of right and wrong, is inherently political.  I think that’s ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How should this community discuss my theory that Donald Trump was the real shooter, not Paddock? I believe Trump did it in an effort to end legalized gambling in Las Vegas, which would result in more tourists using Trump’s casinos in Atlantic City. (We can see the MSM and FBI playing along, with story after story on how “Paddock”’s addiction to Video Poker caused him to snap.) He also wanted to punish Nevada senator Dean Heller for not supporting Trump on the healthcare bill. (Trump had access to the guns thanks to the Secret Service; he acquired his proficiency with them during his time at West Point.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I figured he wasn&#39;t serious. Hard to tell these days.</p>

<p>Even so, I disagree. There&#39;s no harm in entertaining such theories, so long as it&#39;s just something you muse on internally. I&#39;ll take people thinking this place is a silly over not being able to share &quot;silly&quot; ideas any day. Even if I believe many of the ideas are admittedly ridiculous.</p>

<p>I think the scary part is that some of the theories seem so ridiculous at first glance, and that&#39;s what makes them so easily covered up.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t believe for a second that Trump was behind the shooting, but I did consider it once I read his post. And I&#39;m no worse off for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course not. The way I understood it was that he was claiming he orchestrated it. Not that he physically performed the act. Which by the way I still never believed (and I figured he was kidding).</p>

<p>Though again, I have to disagree. Even theories as ridiculous as flat-earth deserve some thought. Because it&#39;s not until you&#39;ve seriously considered the argument being made that you can say it&#39;s false.</p>

<p>I approach CT rationally. I want to investigate and see/hear as much for myself as possible. Always looking for that smoking gun (no pun) that is undeniable. That I can&#39;t rationalize away. That I can&#39;t use logic and common sense to dismiss. </p>

<p>Since this event... So much noise has emerged. So much easily dismissed nonsense that doesn&#39;t need to be explored because it is easily debunked yet...</p>

<p>Half the world wants to focus on the noise instead of continuing to look for real evidence. We have a cyclical effect going on where we spend a few hours hashing out a theory in a popular thread only to have a new crowd pile in the next day after seeing a youtube vid and pronouncing the very theory we&#39;ve already debunked.</p>

<p>Now you come in trying to paint us as shills and patronizing. We are neither. We are trying to sort through the BS to get real evidence. This is only harder if we have to continually re hash the same BS every few hours. </p>

<p>So kindly GTFO with you concern trolling. We&#39;re busy figuring out what really happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a lot of times when an alternative theory to the official story is posted, and someone pokes holes in it, people attack them with arguments that seem to automatically assume the hole poker is on board with the official story.  They get called shills and all sorts of stuff.    </p>

<p>I&#39;m a skeptic.  If something doesn&#39;t make sense to me I&#39;ll question it or point out the flaw if I know (or think I know) something is wrong.  That does not mean I believe or don&#39;t believe the official story.  It just means I&#39;m asking a question about a theory or pointing something out that is wrong with that particular theory.  Simple as that.  Yet sometimes I&#39;ll get attacked for that.</p>

<p>I think it is extremely biased, and close-minded, to ignore official stories that come from the MSM.  I have no problem with people attacking the story from the MSM and making arguments that counter the story, but when I see people like the OP here who immediately dismiss MSM stories just because or try to say this is not the place for MSM I have to shake my head.  Often it seems like to me that people reject MSM stories like this just do it because it doesn&#39;t fit whatever narrative they believe in.  </p>

<p>TLDR: I feel people like the OP just want to censor what people see in this sub to only stuff they want to see.  I think that is stupid.  </p>

That&#39;s why it&#39;s &quot;mainstream&quot; I actually have no problem with that. What bothers me more is there are clearly people here, call them shills, or whatever you want to call them. Their goal is to derail certain threads within a topic. If a thread is actually going somewhere all of a sudden a comment will appear that makes no sense at all or is a personal attack or whatever, suddenly a brigade arrives and this comment has 30 upvotes and subcomments. What was being discussed is now basically covered up. I&#39;ve been seeing this in r/conspiracy for a long time but with this incident especially it&#39;s very blatant.</p>

<p>discuss conspiracy theories around this event</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is my direct experience that a large minority on this sub do not want to do that.  What they want it to have what they know is Truth to be uncritically reinforced by others.</p>

<p>Pointing out a source is wrong 97% of the time isn&#39;t patronizing nor is providing evidence that something is wrong.  Take, for example, the people who said it was wrong for some of the gates to be closed at the concert in Vegas.  When they received information showing this was wrong they ignored it or lashed out.</p>

<p>Same applies to those who say they are doing science when they have no model, no math, no evidence or no experiments.</p>

<p>Putting this another way this isn&#39;t black and white it is a lot more nuanced than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who hasn&#39;t realized that the political left and the political right are two heads of the same beast placed there to give us an illusion of choice is looking too closely. The Donald is the more obnoxious in your face element (I rarely see people here wringing their hands waiting for Hilary&#39;s leadership) but this &quot;The left&quot; vs. &quot;The right&quot; is hilarious when you consider the shining star of proper &quot;rightness&quot; just conceded that Hilary had a point when she said &quot;what if he had a &#39;silencer&#39;?!&quot;, despite the fact that full auto suppressed fire is a finicky and rare thing. </p>

<p>The &quot;right&quot; just agreed to freeze their relaxation on federal gun laws and the left is there doing the same old song and dance: &quot;no one &#39;needs&#39; a firearm_accessory&quot; fill in as needed. A different situation will warrant different roles for the two but the connection remains, two heads of the same beast.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read everything that&#39;s been posted and nothing has legs. It&#39;s people who have decide it&#39;s a conspiracy and are throwing stuff at the wall and hoping it sticks.</p>

<p>The government watching and recording all communications is a real conspiracy it&#39;s one of the most serious issue people of the world face.</p>

<p>This tragedy has really shown that some people on this sub aren&#39;t processing the world in a Normal way their not applying health psychology. We&#39;ve had acts of violence how the whole of human history in multiple countries to jump to its a conspiracy without isn&#39;t healthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think with groups out there like shariablue having warrooms with teams of people posting using bots, that they wouldn&#39;t also try to disrupt the conspiracy narratives?</p>

<p>The people of the world are very close to actually questioning the globalists and not falling for mainstream media propaganda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very important to the globalists to disrupt the narrative because more and more people are lurking soaking in conspiracy theories and when a critical mass inflection point gets hit things will get crazy quick.</p>

<p>Imagine if a good percentage of currently useful idiots started to question the mainstream media?</p>

<p>Already theirs a populist who was on alex jones in the white house.</p>

<p>If this trend continues some of the international bankers and politicians are going to end up up im tribunals getting death sentences.</p>

<p>In my lifetime I dont remember a time where the powers that be seemed more nervous and on edge and threatened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder though, why propaganda is making it to the front page so many times. Being anti-MSM doesnt mean you should accept any other &quot;news outlet&quot;. It doesnt mean we should believe in a random persons opinion. To have a proper discussion you will always need evidence or logical reasoning. And this shooting is a perfect example of the inability to do so. Long time members are just falling for everything that might point to something else when so far we have no reason to do so.

    <div class="md"><p>I happen to enjoy reading entries on this sub, but I feel bad that there may have been people who decided to take action on something written or discussed here.    These are conspiracy theories, meant to provoke thought but I don&#39;t think that anyone in this sub would advocate direct action based on tenuous postings in this sub.    I&#39;ve heard that the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; was coined by an intelligence agency who sought to discredit those whose ideas and speech could prove to be dangerous.    From there, individuals would willingly wear that title when discussing those ideas.</p>

<p>To anybody reading here, I do not believe that anyone who posts here recommends taking direct action based on what gets discussed here.    If you do take action, that&#39;s on you, especially if you act in a manner that you yourself would not like to be treated, for instance having someone barge into your home and firing a shotgun  or having someone come up to you in public and accusing you of being a liar.   Application of the golden rule is recommended.</p>

<p>Ideas are powerful, and I&#39;m worried about those who would take a mental exercise and choose to stress out over it, or choose to directly affect someone else&#39;s life with direct action.   Roko&#39;s Basilisk is a good example of an idea run amok.</p>

<p>Ideas are powerful, but don&#39;t let them control you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the frustration of people purely being here to be contrarian.  It should not be frowned up, however, to ask for the evidence used to as the basis for a theory or opinion.  I see variations of OP constantly and it&#39;s getting old.  It&#39;s essentially saying &quot;I want to be able to speak my mind/opinion and I only want to discuss it with people who agree with me&quot;.  It&#39;s intellectually weak and it also leads to circle jerks.  </p>

<p>If this subreddit wasn&#39;t as politicized as it is, then I&#39;d be more relaxed when it comes to espousing ideas with zero evidence.  Add a &quot;pure speculation&quot; tag if you want. I&#39;ve seen conspiracies that seemingly exist to smear a political opponent and is just an exercise in confirmation bias.  I&#39;m a skeptic that has earnestly tried to be cognizant of my biases.  When I&#39;m discussing various conspiracies involving the media, I expect to be challenged.  If I weren&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t have such a thoroughly developed theory.  I do not like circle jerks and echo chambers and while I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s what OP is asking for, I still believe it&#39;s worth cautioning against when this subject is discussed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This topic won&#39;t hit the mark. The people op is talking about are purposely coming in here to troll. Many of them are definitely paid to do it too; astroturf is a confirmed fact, especially in communities like this. I guess it&#39;s good to have this post up reminding everyone what this community is and what the legitimate people in this community come to this community for, because that calls attention to the trolls who are purposely being assholes. But those assholes are assholes on purpose. They want to be assholes, and asking them nicely to stop being assholes won&#39;t do anything to stop them. We can&#39;t stop them like that. </p>

<p>Personally, I just avoid engaging with people I don&#39;t think are contributing in good faith. Sometimes I&#39;ll drop a comment explaining how they&#39;re full of shit first, but going back and forth with inane bullshit just clutters the forum and makes threads less interesting to read. If someone is being annoying on purpose, trying to fight them just gives them what they want. We should correct lies when we see them, but we shouldn&#39;t feed trolls. I think starving them of that validation is the most effective way to &quot;battle&quot; that type of user. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still don&#39;t seem to be understanding how the English language works. Words convey meaning. Sometimes you use them to convey meaning beyond their literal meaning. So you use figurative speech, hyperbole, metaphors, or allegories etc.  Doing so and trying to pass off such a statement as literally true would be lying. Doing so in a manner designed to make clear the figurative meaning, such as if someone said something sarcastically but with a tone that conveys sarcasm, is just called speaking in English.</p>

<p>Did you miss that I was speaking figuratively or not? Because if you did miss it then that&#39;s a whole different barrel of fish. And if you didn&#39;t miss my actual meaning, which seems more likely, asking for a literal Obama Vampire Theory post would be a deliberately combative and misleading way to try to frame a response I think. One in line with your choice to immediately devolve into vitriol and name calling.</p>

<p>In any event, the topic calls for tolerance of conspiracies and understanding of what this sub is about. I was trying to state my opinion that I agree, but supporting respectful questioning of a theory, or disagreement, must also be encouraged. Disagreement and requests for sources on topics is part of the process of fact finding. It is contributing to the search for knowledge and how bad information is winnowed out. If people don&#39;t support that process and instead call downvoting or questioning a theory brigading/disrespect  then this place will devolved into <a href="/r/conspiracyshowerthoughts">/r/conspiracyshowerthoughts</a>. </p>

<p>(obviously to some extend disrespect/brigading does occur...where could we find someone disrespectful I wonder?... but usually when I see the terms used around here it&#39;s because people are upset not everyone agrees with them).</p>
