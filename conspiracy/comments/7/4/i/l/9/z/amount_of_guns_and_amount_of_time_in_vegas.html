    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m totally with you on this one. Let&#39;s assume he was an arms dealer with ties to whatever bad guys, and for some reason he was doing a  arms deal with a stupidly small amount of legal guns and ammo (for an arms deal), and then someone shoots him because this stupidly small arms deal goes bad, and then they shoot 59 people dead and injure hundreds more.</p>

<p>That one doesn&#39;t add up, at ALL.</p>

<p>My husband owns a ridiculous amount of guns and ammo, and is an avid shooter at a small gun club. His collection absolutely PALES in comparison to a lot of the older dudes with money. None of these people are &quot;arms dealers.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hypothetically, let’s say it WAS an arms deal gone wrong, they would of had to take the time to load all of those magazines, bc they wouldn’t have been preloaded, They would of had to stage the place, bring the hammer with them to smash out the windows, then reign down the terror. As much as it’s plausible, it could easily be debunked. I know the story of the massacre doesn’t sound right but he wasn’t the Lord of War</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my theories is that what ever drove him to do this, could have far more severe outcome (for him personally) than to unload on a crowd of people. </p>

<p>This is out there, but what if there was an arms deal that went bad. And not only himself, but his family was at risk. </p>

<p>Him unloading on a crowd of people automatically make anyone who was close to him a person of interest for the FBI, in a way giving them a type of protection.  </p>

<p>Plausible for me is that some ISIS/Antifa/deepstate baddies set up a buy with intent to kill him and pin the shooting on him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was one gun deal that went really bad. Maybe he didn&#39;t know who he was selling to and turned out to be terrorists that got away. Maybe the government used him as a false flag. You know if your a big enough weapons dealer the government is on to you and maybe even helping. He was a poor kid from the San Fernando valley, I&#39;m actually from there. Lockheed and other aerospace companies were dominant, but left in the 80&#39;s, he&#39;s 20 years older then me. He owned 2 planes so going to assume an efficient pilot and great way to move merchandise and he could launder the money in property. If you make your money running guns you aren&#39;t going to have a Facebook page. </p>

<p>I think the reason for the music events is that it&#39;s easy to move a bunch of bags without prior noticing. Who&#39;s going to look twice at a 64 year old white guy. That&#39;s just my theory. </p>
