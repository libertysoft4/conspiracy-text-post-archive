        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>just 12 minutes after shots began, was apparently on a &quot;random patrol&quot; on the 32nd floor. he was apparently unarmed yet decided to &quot;engage&quot; or investigate the room with a heavily armed shooter.</p>

<p>this smells fishy to me. by this time, 12 minutes after shots had been fired, LVPD were already working their way through the building. hotel security would have all been aware surely that something was going down. wouldn&#39;t you think this guy would GTFO and let the PD do their thing? was his radio switched off or something? how did he even know the right room to look into?</p>

<p>Seriously tho his story doesn’t sound legit...again, Paddock went thru all the meticulousness to make sure everything was right but leaves his room door propped open for Jesus or housekeeping to come and make a delivery as he’s creating a massacre.....come on! </p>
