        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There hasn&#39;t been this much speculation and outrage over an act of violence for a long time.</p>

<p>I feel like even &quot;normal&quot; people are starting to realize that something fucky is going on here.</p>

<p>People died and information is being withheld. But the truth is out there.</p>

<p>Regardless of whatever this shooting was about, it was sloppy, and people are noticing the inconsistencies. </p>

<p>I hope this opens people&#39;s eyes to the fact that we can be deceived, and have been deceived in the past. That those in power are encarnations of evil. That this would not be the first time they murdered us, staged events, harvested souls, given weapons to enemies they themselves created, and stirred a hive-mind of negative energy in order for them to survive.</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about. It&#39;s a God damned fight for survival.</p>

<p>All these years we&#39;ve been programmed to need money. Buying things we don&#39;t need. Consume garbage instead of producing something sustainable.</p>

<p>They thrive at the expense of our suffering. Whether it&#39;s billionairs that make their fortunes off the sweat of the misguided, or pedophilic cannibals that feed off the blood of the innocent. </p>

<p>Whoever the fuck they are, they need to maintain thier system at whatever the cost. </p>

<p>They bury the fragile ones with drugs and debt. The ones strong enough to stand are faced with barriers, and once they make it over them all they see is the same fucked up wasteland, except this time they&#39;re above it, and they can only go back, or be a part of the wall. </p>

<p>TEAR DOWN THIS FUCKING WALL and build something greater. Something that will support us instead of divide us. We need to change the way we think, but a lot of us are afraid of of change. We&#39;re scared of what we aren&#39;t certain about. we&#39;re afraid of the dark. </p>

<p>But we are beings of light. And once we realize that there is no darkness, but only absence of light... we&#39;ll be okay.</p>

<p>Go forth and be the light.</p>

<p>Aaaand that&#39;s enough rhetoric for today.</p>

<p>use everything you save and invest it in yourself. grow whatever food you can, it doesn&#39;t have to be a lot. Invest in solar energy, in a few years it will be far more efficient. if you plan on buying a car, buy electric, don&#39;t give the oil companies more money. Take your money and use it against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so they did a study about censorship in china, to see what was being censored, and it seemed that the chinese censors would allow the people to complain about almost anything, but as soon as the people started talking about <em>actually doing something about it</em>, thats when they get shut down</p>

<p>its probably similar in USA</p>

<p>of all of the various forms of activism, the one that scares the establishment the most is &quot;direct action&quot;</p>

<p>what is &quot;direct action&quot;?</p>

<p>lets say there is a village with one well, and the man who owns the well is a tyrant</p>

<p>the villagers could sit around and complain about his tyranny, </p>

<p>or they could just go dig a new well.</p>

<p>most people would rather sit around complaining about the tyranny than doing something about it</p>

<p>as they say, </p>

<p>stop focusing on tearing down the old, and start focusing on building the new </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest lie we&#39;re fed is that human nature is violent and aggressive, that everyone has some &#39;dark side&#39; or whatever. It&#39;s totaly nonsense. Humans are by nature loving, sociable, empathic beings. The vast majority of people just want to live in peace. The vast majority of human beings that kill do so for a pay check, to survive. Whereas think of how many human beings work to help others with no compensation, just out of love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re very hierarchic, which we get from apes. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re generally empathetic except where it fits into our hierarchy. For example it&#39;s ordinary people who commit genocide, and they abandon what Jesus would call empathy in order to do so - but it&#39;s only &#39;outsiders&#39; we&#39;re slaughtering so whatever. And then there&#39;s ordinary competition: you fight your way up the ladder so your DNA can attract a more viable mate.</p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting for me is how the internet is changing our perception of the hierarchies. For one thing if everyone born in Syria has a smartphone then privileged nationalities - our being born in Europe and America and therefore having better lives for no reason - become impossible to justify using any conventional morality. So we have to give voice to our hierarchic prejudices, heretofore unmentionable, and of course it&#39;s not pretty.</p>

<p>Maybe self-awareness is born from it though. If we&#39;re crushing people for being born poor and we can no longer call them foreign because they have smartphones and are in the same conversations as us, we&#39;ll need new stories. Instinctively I don&#39;t think we could transition from more honest stories to less honest ones, e.g. the Nazi stuff that&#39;s getting popular is surely unstable. We&#39;ll probably latch onto all kinds of bullshit in the meantime. </p>

<p>If some part of the government and/or other powerful entity did it, I doubt they&#39;d fake it. Far easier and more convincing to just shoot at the crowd, and if they are willing to go to these lengths (setting up a shooting) for whatever end goal they had in mind, I doubt they&#39;d be above doing so.</p>

<p>schools are not what they seem. schools are there to take the children away from the family and give them over to a state employee. this allows the government to indoctrinate the children with propaganda without much interference from pesky parents, and allows the female to be available to work outside the home, to flood the market with cheap labor as women compete with men for jobs, thus driving down wages. working men have not received a real raise since 1973.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdtdidL2MQo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdtdidL2MQo</a></p>

<p>furthermore, schools fill your mind with drivel like the Bohr model of the atom, the Big Bang model of the universe, that vaccines are safe and effective and that men have walked on the moon. </p>

<p>whats worse is that they mis-instruct the students so thoroughly with programs like &quot;common core&quot; that the students aren&#39;t even capable of using their math and science skills as part of their critical thinking.</p>

<p>not to pick on you personally, but if you are the typical America, i would hazard to guess that: </p>

<p>1) you still believe men walked on the moon</p>

<p>2) you can&#39;t apply math and science to understand why 1 is impossible </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone think that TPTB are <strong>loving</strong> all of this overwhelming attention to the matter? Watch now something <em>horrific</em> is going to come back because of this extra attention, and this event will go down as the &quot;Vegas Incident&quot; of 2017? No matter what happens, it seems it&#39;s inevitable that it could be swayed in whatever direction seems necessary for the agenda (if that&#39;s what is going on). I&#39;m not saying this just applies here, but it&#39;s similar to throwing the &quot;out there&quot; views of conspiracy like flat earth in the limelight to discredit conspiracies as a whole. The whole term conspiracy is a damnation in itself as it was designed and intended to be. A religious person will claim to be religious, but not <em>that</em> kind of religious.</p>

<p>Think of the leverage that could pull. &quot;Oh no, that&#39;s just silly talk. That&#39;s the kind of talk that led to the Vegas Incident&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if i&#39;m wording this right, but it&#39;s kind of a scary concept if you&#39;re catching my drift. Very akin to the patriot act in ways. Getting people aware to all the fuckery going on, could quite possibly be used against the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people are over it, sick of hearing about it. Everyone went to work this week. Everyone has bills. People are still watching TV, going to movies, restaurants, drinking, playing on their iphone. It was awful. But how long can you sit in front of the TV and cry about it? Life goes on. How much did Orlando change things? Uh none? That was long gone and forgotten within a month for 99.9% of the country. </p>

<p>Once Black Friday hits, xmas is coming, you&#39;ll be hard pressed to find anyone who gives a shit. People around this sub have had rock hard boners since it happened, this is their xmas, birthday, new years rolled into one. Footage, interviews, largest mass murder, this is the glory hole. But for 99.9% of the country, their weekend plans havent changed. So uh, no.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But is this really a false flag? To control the narrative you need a motive. Motives are easy to cook up. The fact there is no motive, letting people creative their own theories, works against the goal of a false flag. This has to be the least scripted mass murder ever. He was a nut job dating back years. Sometimes a crazy person is just a crazy person. </p>

<p>No one has given a decent theory as to a goal of any deception? Chaos? Destabilize? That works against the goals of the global powers. They want us being happy little sheep enjoying our Starbucks and iPhones. These events cast a light on the problems going on that the powers would rather you ignore. </p>

<p>So the idea vegas was a false flag is silly. </p>

<p>The sad truth. And unfortunately, so many pick the later. Often it&#39;s rationalized with feeding and protecting &quot;your family&quot;.</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t the concept of family just more divisions as well.  Only when the entire human race can say that humans are a giant family, then would there ever be true peace (until the reptilians come)</p>

<p>The fact that there&#39;s any trust still around and wasn&#39;t already lost long ago is I think a big part of the problem.  No more trust worthy of being given to the establishment.  At all.</p>
