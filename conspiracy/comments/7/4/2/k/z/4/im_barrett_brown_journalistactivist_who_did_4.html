        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been asked by the moderators to do an AMA here, presumably because a lot of my work has focused on opaque relationships between governments and private entities, and because my adventures have given me access to a lot of very telling scenarios involving secrecy, conspiracy, and state criminality. Here&#39;s my bio with further details:</p>

<p>Barrett Brown is a writer and anarchist activist. His work has appeared in Vanity Fair, the Guardian, The Intercept, Huffington Post, New York Press, Skeptic, The Daily Beast, al-Jazeera, and dozens of other outlets. In 2009 he founded Project PM, a distributed think-tank, which was later re-purposed to oversee a crowd-sourced investigation into the private espionage industry and the intelligence community at large via e-mails stolen from federal contractors and other sources.</p>

<p>In 2011 and 2012 he worked with Anonymous on campaigns involving the Tunisian revolution, government misconduct, and other issues. In mid-2012 he was arrested and later sentenced to four years in federal prison on charges stemming from his investigations and work with Anonymous. While imprisoned, he won the National Magazine Award for his column, The Barrett Brown Review of Arts and Letters and Prison.
Upon his release in late 2016 he began work on the Pursuance System, a platform for mass civic engagement and coordinated opposition. His third book, a memoir/manifesto, will be released in 2018 by Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux.</p>

<p>Video Q/A that I did with our project manager/lead developer Steve Phillips, who&#39;s on about halfway through to go into technical details that I&#39;m not competent to discuss myself, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOoPyovqk2Q">here</a></p>

<p>Update 3:30 CST - I&#39;m going to take a break, but will be back later today to answer everything I haven&#39;t gotten to yet, and whatever other questions appear in the meantime.</p>

<p>Update 8:00 CST - I got to a few more questions but probably won&#39;t be able to answer the rest. On the other hand, the Pursuance System&#39;s project lead, Steve Phillips, has stopped by to provide a comprehensive response to the more technical questions, along with links to further details at github and whatnot.

    <div class="md"><p>I was heavily pessimistic after spending my mid-20s covering U.S. politics and doing a lot of media criticism, which slowly taught me how much worse our press, government, and much of the citizenry is than is evident even to largely well-informed people. I don&#39;t have much certainty regarding the future, other than to say that we&#39;re entering a period of extraordinarily high stakes that will require honest people who respect the rights of others to start taking full advantage of the internet, which is why I&#39;ve been intent on getting this pursuance system up and running for last seven years (only getting to it now because of course I ended up getting occupied with other matters, like Anonymous and prison).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fundamental purpose of the system is to allow anyone falling within our agreed ideological framework - opposition to police state, drug war, and surveillance state, however one defines these things - to combat the institutions that are responsible for the trends you refer to. The specifics can be seen on the website as well as the video we did a few weeks back, which I&#39;ll link to from main post in a bit, but broadly, this is a framework that will allow participants to vastly enhance and expand the efforts that are already being made - such as by non-profits, activist groups, and informal movements - while also making it easier to implement new ideas, find people to help with them, and keep everything from descending into drama and inaction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Barrett, thanks so much for being here with us today.</p>

<p>My question is thus, on websites like reddit (which were once used to aggregate content freely as it was put out) more and more, small groups are using their foothold on the platform to excwersize subtle/veiled influence over how content is able to flow on the platform.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best example of this trend was exposed via the GI Files from wikileaks, wherein it came out that Alexis Ohanian runs a social media consulting firm called &quot;Antique Jetpack&quot;, and <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?q=antique+jetpack&amp;amp;mfrom=&amp;amp;mto=&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;notitle=&amp;amp;date=&amp;amp;nofrom=&amp;amp;noto=&amp;amp;count=50&amp;amp;sort=0&amp;amp;file=&amp;amp;docid=&amp;amp;relid=0#searchresult">had offered his services to startfor</a>. </p>

<p>How do those kind of social media consulting firms threaten the flow of information in the modern age in your opinion, and what do systems such as your new Pursuance Project offer by way of oversight of those kind of veiled forces?</p>

<p>Hey Mr. Brown. Thanks for doing this. My question concerns Operation Cartel.</p>

<p>The operation, or at least any focus on Los Zetas, was officially ceased, but you claimed to be continuing the effort as a solo agent. What happened with this? Last I heard (in like 2011) you were working with at least one reporter to sift through 25,000 emails and at least 60 names, and there was also an unnamed United States District Attorney that might have been implicated.</p>

<p>Did the investigation go nowhere? Did it stop or never get published for different reasons? Or, is the investigation still ongoing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even the ones who supported my cause and thought highly of what I&#39;d done both outside and in the prison by challenging the authorities were ultimately cowards who had no problem locking me up in the SHU illegally on the orders of an assistant warden whose feelings I hurt.

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing came of my efforts. As I noted back then, I never had access to those e-mails, which were in the hands of Anonymous Veracruz or some such thing; my initial role was simply advocating for the operation, which had become controversial very quickly, and conveying developments from the Mexican Anons to U.S. press. Later, I had the notion of working to pair Mexican journalists with U.S. outlets so that those who had info they were reluctant to release in-country could securely send it to the U.S. to be broadcast/disseminated - basically &quot;laundering journalism.&quot; I had a meeting to this end with a Mexican reporter who flew up, but soon enough I was raided by the FBI, and meanwhile I had other distractions, not the least of which were drugs, that prevented me from following through on things like this.</p>

<p>The DA you&#39;re referring to was brought to my attention by an unrelated individual, and didn&#39;t stem from any e-mails, and despite some of the reports that came out, he was never suspected of being involved with cartels. Rather, he seemed to have a relationship with local criminals, and this was something that the press in that city - Asheville, North Carolina - had apparently heard as well, based on my calls up there. But it didn&#39;t seem like there was anything to be done about it, so I moved on to other issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reporters tend to be more liberal than the population at large, whereas editors and publishers tend to be more conservative, but it&#39;s more nuanced than that, as the reporters are more socially liberal than economically liberal (in U.S. sense of interventionism), and at any rate that bias is less important than the non-political biases and heuristics that define much of what actually gets reported and to what extent. Every individual has ambitions, limitations, self-image, etc, and reporters have to cater to editors and producers, who ultimately define what the press puts out. The NYT is a great example of how this actually works. For all the nonsense about how everyone there is secretly and perpetually working to help the Democrats and whatever, when Judith Miller had a piece that supposedly bolstered Bush&#39;s case for Iraq War, they happily ran with it and ignored objections from other reporters about the way she was doing her job - because she&#39;d won awards, for one thing, and because, by and large, an individual editor&#39;s greatest concern is his own reputation for getting important stories.</p>

<p>The nuances of how information flows within the news media as well as other structures has always been my greatest interest, so naturally I have a lot more to say about this subject, as it&#39;s very complicated and requires a great deal of actual research and first-hand knowledge to understand, just like mechanics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a very heady book, if you are curious. I think you&#39;d find value in it. In terms of outlines of modern international political philosophy, it is likely one of the best &#39;post 1900&#39; sources, aside the collective speeches of Malcolm X, which are presented in a similar style, but eventually become more enlightened as plane travel had been made popular by the 1960&#39;s, and Malcolm X was more educated and less bent on exterminating thought opponents.</p>

<p>The &#39;Jew obsession&#39;, is of course based in fact, but amounts to less than 5% of the book, I would say (as far as I&#39;ve gotten) - and even then, Jew is merely substitute for &#39;the unseen enemy&#39;. The parts discussing society, the corrupting influences of international regimes, the systematic brainwashing of conquered peoples, the false illusions of hope presented by soulless governments, etc, largely ring true today, as they did in the times of Thomas Paine and Benjamin Franklin, and so on.</p>

<p>In terms of political writings, ignoring Aristotle&#39;s didactic notes on Politics, Generation and Corruption, I would put Malcolm X speeches and Mein Kampf in the top minds post 1900, with Benjamin Franklin&#39;s autobiography and collective writings being the most enlightened (for Western Culture), and the works of Thomas Paine being the most poetic, and humanist.</p>

<p>There is a reason the book was banned. Not because you read it and all the sudden you hate Jews, but because after reading it, you learn how a homeless orphan street worker used the power of his mind to change a continent of men. That is not something many can do. Adolf was very brilliant, though lacking all forms of formal education and having something of an obsession with killing people who opposed him did contributed to stagnation, coupled with the limited abilities of communication of the 1930&#39;s (as you mention, today is unlike any other time in history).</p>

<p>All the same, considering you are writing a Manifesto, I figured you might want to read the one that probably changed more lives than any other throughout history, and at the fastest pace. Propaganda serves a purpose. You won&#39;t finish the book with a hatred of Jews, but you might be more prepared to defeat the powers which enslave mankind. But who knows, I guess we all interpret things differently. Good luck in your conquests.</p>

<p>Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God</p>

<ul>
<li>Original Motto for the United States of America (un&#39;adopted) as presented by Benjamin Franklin at the Continental Congress.</li>

<p>Oh, how the world would have changed had we listened more astutely, and understood more deeply to that trickster of a peasant :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There will be no TOS as such, in part because we&#39;d have no way of enforcing it. Participants need only agree to a broad statement of principles I&#39;ve described elsewhere. The settings for document storage are variable; pursuances can handle that and a number of other questions in many different ways, via the settings and via the particular structures they develop and what working relationships between users are agreed to.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I tend not to answer technical questions because I myself am not technical, and I want any explanation to be exact and come from the people who are making those decisions because I don&#39;t want to put out something that&#39;s even slightly incorrect. In previous AMAs, including another that was done on reddit, our project manager was on hand to answer questions; I&#39;d be happy to have him come by and answer these. His handle is elimisteve. </p>

<p>The answer to the broader question about how we&#39;ll handle unauthorized sharing is that we don&#39;t, because we&#39;re not running the individual pursuances, though we&#39;d advise anyone working with sensitive documents to only make them accessible to those they&#39;re comfortable having them, as with any other situation. That sort of thing is not something we aim to completely solve; rather, we&#39;re giving users enough functionality so that they can minimize risks based on the particular circumstances of what they&#39;re doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Steve Phillips here, the project manager/lead developer of Pursuance that Barrett mentioned in his intro.</p>

<p>Great questions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The description of Pursuance on the main site is long on ideas but short on technical specs. Could you tell us a bit more about how the Pursuance system works technically?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, here is an overview of the technical aspects of Pursuance and some specifics on what makes it unique: <a href="https://gist.github.com/elimisteve/5f434892dba623aaae052aafa69456a4">https://gist.github.com/elimisteve/5f434892dba623aaae052aafa69456a4</a></p>

<p>The core feature set we will launch with is: end-to-end encrypted task management (currently under development) + chat + secure file- and link-sharing (provided by <a href="https://www.leapchat.org/#PublicPursuanceCommunity-JinglingTidbitNicotineExcerptNutcrackerElongatedRummageUnnoticedAftershaveTweezersDepotUnwrinkledHelmetFridgeJudiciaryWheatNuggetPaprikaSwordAwarenessTacoSulphurJetskiCapsuleDriftwood">LeapChat</a>, which we&#39;ve recently built and launched!).</p>

<p>Soon after we will add a more fine-grained permissions system (discussed below), karma points (guess where that idea came from?), and a trust score/reputation system.  Eventually we will integrate other tools, like those from Transparency Toolkit, for doing more specialized tasks (like OCR&#39;ing and/or dealing with a very large volume of documents).</p>

<p><strong>Fundamentally, the Pursuance System enables you to create a pursuance (which is a sort of organization), invite people to that pursuance (with the appropriate level of permissions), assign those people tasks (manually, or automatically based on their skill set!), brainstorm and discuss what needs to be done, rapidly record exciting ideas or strategies in an actionable format, share files and documents, be notified when relevant events occur (e.g., you are assigned a task or mentioned), and effectively ask for help from others.</strong></p>

<p>You do not need to specify your email address in order to create an account, but if you do then the emails you get will be PGP-encrypted if you so choose, and even if you don&#39;t want to deal with PGP, the emails will still be privacy-preserving, saying things like, &quot;you were mentioned 3 times&quot; or &quot;you have been assigned a task&quot; without providing any details about who mentioned you nor what that assigned task is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it a block chain/Golang application?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our tech stack is React.js + Go + Postgres + <a href="https://tryingtobeawesome.com/postgrest/">PostgREST</a>.  We&#39;re also using WebSockets so that the server can push real-time updates (messages, notifications, and new tasks) to users, and of course the site is HTTPS-only.  We are using <a href="https://securityheaders.io/?q=leapchat.org&amp;amp;followRedirects=on">very secure HTTP headers</a> -- the same that <a href="https://www.leapchat.org/#PublicPursuanceCommunity-JinglingTidbitNicotineExcerptNutcrackerElongatedRummageUnnoticedAftershaveTweezersDepotUnwrinkledHelmetFridgeJudiciaryWheatNuggetPaprikaSwordAwarenessTacoSulphurJetskiCapsuleDriftwood">LeapChat</a> uses, LeapChat being an app for end-to-end encrypted chat app I started right before I met Barrett and that ~6 of us have since built out, using <a href="https://github.com/kaepora/minilock">audited crypto</a>, that we are integrating into the heart of Pursuance.</p>

<p>Pursuance will initially be a responsive web app that works well on any desktop or mobile browser.  Later we will create native apps (using React Native on mobile and Electron on desktop).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will it go live as a .onion domain?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  The default configuration of the Pursuance System software (running on a server) makes every pursuance accessible via a .onion domain.  Our instance will also be accessible via pursuanceproject.org in addition to the .onion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How will you handle unauthorized (by the contract) document sharing? ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s possible to solve the trust problem entirely -- if you trust someone you shouldn&#39;t trust, they can find a way to abuse that trust, and even if you initially trust someone for good reason, they can be co-opted (e.g., bribed), or have their device seized and used against even <em>their</em> will -- there are several safeguards and features we are putting in place to accommodate this sort of concern we&#39;ve heard from people:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When you invite a not-yet-trusted person to your private pursuance, you can choose to give them very limited privileges.  Specifically you can make it so they can only view and comment on tasks that they have been assigned without letting them see any other tasks, documents, or messages in that pursuance.</p></li>
<li><p>An advanced feature we&#39;re adding is the ability to assign tasks <em>to other pursuances</em>, which, among other things, makes it easier for people who like working together as a &quot;crew&quot; to form their own pursuance that floats around the Pursuance ecosystem to do various useful tasks for others.  This maintains a clear boundary between different groups (that is, pursuances), but allows those groups to meaningfully collaborate.  I mention this feature in this context because you can use this &quot;task outsourcing&quot; feature to basically create cells of different users in different pursuances, each with their own cache of files and documents that they have exclusive access to.  If you give multiple people access to the same exact document, yes, it&#39;ll be hard to know who leaked what (just as it is for the NSA), but at least you can radically limit the pool of people who could have leaked it -- by limiting who has access to it, and do so without limiting your ability to effectively collaborate with them.</p></li>
<li><p>A feature we probably won&#39;t launch with but will come later is a reputation system, which will help with deciding who to assign a particular task to (or you can have Pursuance choose for you, based on which skills you say are needed to complete that task, and who has that skill set!).  And after that we will probably let people show their own per-pursuance reputation in a sort of global profile, so you can see where someone has been effective and trustworthy before inviting them to your pursuance.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>...and in answering this question, I just realized that having people provide references (&quot;person X will vouch for me&quot;) could be interesting.  Hmm...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will there be an easy method to expose documents to the www? ... Can it be used to publish leaked documents anonymously?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the foreseeable future we will probably just encourage people to use <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/">CryptPad</a>, which allows you to create an end-to-end encrypted (using JS) document that can be collaboratively edited in the browser -- great for creating documents that will either remain private or be made public -- and that gives you a read-only link to that document that you can give to the world without allowing anyone to edit.  It&#39;s a little buggy, but it&#39;s pretty good and is getting better.</p>

<p>Sharing the read-write or read-only links via a private/encrypted pursuance with those you&#39;re collaborating with means that even if, worst-case scenario, the pursuance system server you&#39;re collaborating through <em>and</em> CryptPad get hacked, your data will still be safe; the key needed to decrypt the link to the docs will be encrypted with a key the hacker does not have.</p>

<p>A related question we sometimes get is -- can Pursuance be used by a source to much more conveniently do what Snowden and others did?</p>

<p>The answer is -- yes, though this is trickier than it sounds to do safely, because the source of the &quot;document&quot; could include malware in it that, you know, hijacks the journalist&#39;s computer :-\ .  <a href="https://securedrop.org/">SecureDrop</a> (awesome project btw!) handles this by having the journalist/document recipient transfer documents to an air-gapped and not-internet-connected machine before opening them.  That way the malware won&#39;t have access to the journalist&#39;s data, and won&#39;t be able to exfiltrate any data nor phone home at all.</p>

<p>If Snowden would have had the Pursuance System, he could have set it up at a new domain, emailed Glenn Greenwald in the clear, sent him a single-use encrypted link using <a href="https://minishare.io/">miniShare</a>, another in-beta tool we&#39;ve built and quietly launched (and may build into Pursuance) that would take Glenn to the Pursuance instance, and invite him to the particular (private/encrypted) pursuance on that server where Glenn could download the documents once he made an account. :tada:</p>

<p>This process would require the journalist to click 2 links, and create 1 account with a fairly long password -- <em>that&#39;s it.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there a TOS? If so, what will it look like?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Barrett answered this, but I would just add that the basic legal TOS we will use will be privacy-preserving in nature; we are a non-profit that cares about protecting its users and their (your!) privacy, and have no incentive to do anything but.</p>

<p>If you have ideas for what we should be sure to include or exclude, please email us at <a href="mailto:team@pursuanceproject.org">team@pursuanceproject.org</a> or <a href="mailto:pursuanceproject@protonmail.com">pursuanceproject@protonmail.com</a> .  Thanks!</p>

<p>And lastly, I&#39;d like to add that <strong>Barrett and I will be giving the first public demo of Pursuance at Aaron Swartz Day on November 4th</strong>, which I&#39;m told will be livestreamed!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Steve, I&#39;d first like to thank you for working on this system which seems to have a ton of potential. I&#39;ve been excited about this since I learned about it three months ago or so, and the fact you&#39;ve open sourced the code has assuaged a number of my fears. I haven&#39;t had a chance to really dig in yet, but I plan to. </p>

<p>On a logistical note on the end-to-end encryption, let&#39;s say I&#39;m part of a pursuance with 100 others, and I want to upload a file that&#39;s available to everyone else. If I&#39;m understanding this correctly, I would have to encrypt a separate file for each person with their particular public key (or passphrase/email equivalent key), no? It seems therefore that storage space will scale at O(N x M) where N is the number of users in a pursuance and M is size of the files available to that pursuance. This seems like it could become a fairly big obstacle and you would need to set some potentially low limits on either the number of users per pursuance or the amount of shared storage space per pursuance. I&#39;m wondering how you plan to address this. </p>

<p>Are you currently looking for developers to contribute code, or the development being done more in-house at this point?</p>

<p>Thank you!  I am happy to be working on something that thousands of people are excited about, and has clear potential to change the world for the better, so thank you for your support.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Good question, but we have good solutions to this -- 2, actually.</p>

<p>The first is miniLock (<a href="https://github.com/kaepora/minilock">https://github.com/kaepora/minilock</a>).  miniLock is what we&#39;re using to derive a keypair from a username and passphrase that the user memorizes.  But there&#39;s also a miniLock file format that solves the exact problem you&#39;ve mentioned.  This file format creates a new random symmetric key that is used to encrypt the file/data, and then <em>encrypts a copy of that key</em> to each recipient using their public key.  And these keys are just 32 bytes.  So sharing a 100mb with 10 people via miniLock won&#39;t require ~1GB of storage, but ~100mb of storage plus ~320 bytes.</p>

<p>But this is only necessary when you need to encrypt something intended for a closed set of people.</p>

<p>Generally you will want to encrypt data -- tasks, messages, files, and links -- in such a way that new people can see them when they join your pursuance.</p>

<p>So how do we solve <em>that</em>?  With shared keys!</p>

<p>When you get invited to a private (encrypted) pursuance with at least a certain level of permissions/capabilities, you will actually be receiving an encrypted copy of a pursuance-wide key that is used to encrypt some things in that pursuance -- mostly other keys, which in turn encrypt individual tasks or chat rooms.</p>

<p>So when you want to invite 5 specific people to a private chat room, behind the scenes our code will use miniLock for that.  But when you create a new task, for example, a new key will be generated, encrypted with the pursuance-wide key, and uploaded to our server where only people in that pursuance with sufficient privileges will be able to download it.</p>

<p>Of course none of these keys will be stored in plaintext in our database, meaning not even the person hosting the Pursuance server will be able to passively spy on what people are doing in private pursuances are doing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>PM me if you are interested in helping build Pursuance!  Our stack is React.js on the frontend, where almost all the features are being added, and a bit of Go on the backend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, that makes a lot of sense. So it&#39;s essentially using the same session key for the symmetric encryption and then encrypting that key with each recipient&#39;s public miniLock ID as a public key. Sounds great!</p>

<p>There&#39;s also another reason for that, it&#39;s that asymmetric systems are really slow and encrypting a large file with it is inefficient. Which is why every ransomware uses a different key for each file and encrypts it with their key.</p>

<p>I feel for the moderators...having to put up with unwarranted attacks of &quot;SHILL&quot; every time someone disagrees has to be annoying. Unfortunately none of those reported comments were removed. </p>

<p>Is it ok to stalk users and call them shills? I reported all three comments and none were removed?</p>

<p>The first is what do you think is going on with Wikileaks and Assange? I know you have been critical somewhat of his tweets, and the  change in the way they present themselves has been noticeable.    Is this reflecting the internal changes due to Gavin MacFadyen passing away? </p>

<p>My second question is concerning Matt Dehart. Are you familiar with his case and are you involved in any way? </p>

<p>Thanks again.  </p>

<p>The pursuance library will also provide access to written case studies submitted by users. These may cover a particular structure, pursuance, or settings configuration that the submitter has either developed or used, in which case they&#39;ll be visible in the library when one views the item in question in addition to being searchable by other means.

<p>What are you thinking for the Library structure for archiving, an &#39;ad hoc&#39; pop culture system, like Reddit, or a Scientific, Dewey Decimal type system, or other?</p>

<p>Personally I like 100 point scale systems by topic, coupled with &#39;by Author&#39; and &#39;sources of inspiration&#39;. Or something like that. What are you thinking?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have specifics on that yet, and I&#39;m not sure if our project developer Steve Phillips has thought more about it yet; there are a number of ways it can be done, of course. Incidentally, it&#39;s one of the more important aspects of all this, as it allows everyone to use pursuance in perpetual best-practices style rather than having to reinvent the wheel, and will foment continual evolution of the structures people use to accomplish their tasks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The Dewey Decimal system isn&#39;t really the best, but I do think &#39;100 point scales&#39; are very useful.</p>

<p>Granted, this is outside the realm of what you are tackling, Benjamin liked to organize literature into practical, useful disciplines. In such a way, his readers became better economic earners, leading to more societal power, eventually.</p>

<p>I think there are two aspects to human history. One being Scientific Study, which is somewhat random and subjective, and another being the &#39;study of humans&#39;, which is more evolutionary and can be replicated. It&#39;s very interesting to note how one progresses in life from a poor servant boy to a leader of men, to me, and to review their sources of inspiration, and so on. Many fall into the trap that either &#39;that person&#39; was born a god, or that &#39;they&#39; are born to be stupid, but in fact I&#39;d many of us have the power to choose whomever we&#39;d want to be : Leader or Servant, but the latter socially encouraged.</p>

<p>&quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; I think is a pretty good telling of how our past choices dictate our future, which is to say that one can not simply &#39;become a good person&#39;, but they must evolve throughout life to be one. The study of how others have evolved, including yourself, is a story which others should know.</p>

<p>Regarding 100 point scales for study, you can use broad categorizations, such as 10, 20, 30... and then merely add a digit for the next level of subcategory 101, 102, 103... 1011, 1012, 1013... and so on, the thus get near infinitesimal deep.</p>

<p>However, by limiting it to 100 points on a given topic (or something smaller) it doesn&#39;t become disorganized, and the time of study required for mastery becomes reasons, with large portions of society drawing from shared events and understanding. Likewise, it would encourage some forms of curation, which as the project expands becomes important, otherwise a torrent of crap drowns the scientific, or good. Good luck building your brave new world :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from accepting the basic premise of opposition to police state, drug war, and surveillance state, users will have a variety of opinions and approaches. The system is intended to allow anyone to create their own pursuance and expand it however they like, accepting or denying participation as they see fit, delegating power as much or as little as they want, and developing agreements and connections with other pursuances as desired. This will allow for a rich ecosystem of experimentation while also ensuring that those who don&#39;t want to work with others with particular opinions have plenty of options to do so. So, someone can set up a pursuance and let it expand indefinitely, allowing for majority votes on every major decision, but many of them will be structured in a more regimented way. It&#39;s up to each individual to choose which pursuances to be involved in (or to apply to, anyway) and to create their own on along different lines if necessary.</p>

<p>There are a handful of people in the world who now jointly control far more than 50% of the hashing power on the network.  Anyone with the capacity to hack into some computers, or co-opt a handful of people into fabricating transactions on the network, or convince others with this hashing power to join them in a conspiracy, could create  fabricated transactions -- transactions that say that the BTC you sent to your friend was actually sent to the attacker creating this fake transaction, for example.</p>

<p>The main disincentive toward doing this is that if everyone loses confidence in the Bitcoin blockchain, Bitcoins won&#39;t be worth anything anymore, in which case illegitimately minting Bitcoins for yourself would be self-defeating; having a lot more coins worth dramatically less per coin doesn&#39;t make you richer, it makes you poorer.</p>

<p>But notice that this means we&#39;re not trusting the math anymore, but incentives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right to state that the centralisation of mining is a major issue. However, the dangers you list are incorrect. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone with the capacity to hack into some computers, or co-opt a handful of people into fabricating transactions on the network, or convince others with this hashing power to join them in a conspiracy, could create  fabricated transactions -- transactions that say that the BTC you sent to your friend was actually sent to the attacker creating this fake transaction, for example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Miners have far less power than many people think. Mining just orders transactions. Miner&#39;s cannot create transactions that spend user&#39;s bitcoin. Not even a malicious majority. The worst they can do is either block transactions (missing out on those fees) or trick an exchange business into trading a national currency for Bitcoin and quickly causing a one or two block re-org. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main disincentive toward doing this is that if everyone loses confidence in the Bitcoin blockchain,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cost of miner attacks actually have huge, direct financial penalties as high as millions of dollars a day. And a low likelihood of success. And then the full node users boot them off the network which basically means bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Miner&#39;s that misbehave, even a malicious majority, are automatically recognised and ignored by full nodes under most circumstances. If necessary, nodes can nuke them by changing the proof of work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But notice that this means we&#39;re not trusting the math anymore, but incentives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you run a full node, you enforce the rules and are protected by the math And the incentives. If you don&#39;t, you are trusting incentives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: Bitcoin is in fact not trustless; you&#39;re trusting those who control the majority of the hashing power not to conspire to fabricate transactions in their favor.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is not trustless. It is trust-minimising via cryptography, game theory, and network architecture.</p>

<p>Like science isn&#39;t truth, it is error-minimising.</p>

<p>The distinctions between different classes of network participants is a fascinating and widely misunderstood area. It&#39;s crucial for understanding how Bitcoin works and if the experiment succeeds or fails into .</p>

<p>A full node verifies the full blockchain history, verifies that new transactions adhere to the consensus rules, and passes those transactions on. This is how Bitcoin provides individual economic sovereignty - full nodes are peers. When you run a full node, you choose which rules you will follow and enforce. </p>

<p>Mining bundles transactions into blocks and adds them to the blockchain. They do this in a way that makes it extremely expensive to try to rewrite history because to do so you must prove to full nodes that you burned more energy than the rest of the network combined.</p>

<p>If a miner produces a block of transactions, it must be accepted by the full nodes for the miner to receive their reward. Otherwise they have simply burned a huge amount of energy for nothing.</p>

<p>It is expected that miners will be running full nodes, but that is not always the case. It has become apparent that some skip doing this in some cases to increase profits (at the risk of greater loss due to lowered security).</p>

<p>Some confusion arises from the fact that in the Bitcoin whitepaper and in early discussions the term &#39;node&#39; was used to refer to both types of network participants. The overlap between miners and full nodes was extremely high. The distinction between the two became significant as mining became centralised and too burdensome for most network participants.</p>

<p>There&#39;s little doubt that Putin was behind these, and the Smolensk air crash, and the murders of Litvinenko and Politkovskaya and many others. But Putin&#39;s motives are always an quasi-altruistic &quot;what benefits Mother Russia&quot; and in that respect his actions can be construed as morally abhorrent, but they are always morally consistent.

    <div class="md"><p>Putin is a Russian patriot. By all accounts, he has greatly self-enriched himself as the Russian President from unclear (but obviously corrupt) sources, but his political actions are always aligned with defending and/or promoting a long-term Russian agenda. </p>

<p>His military intervention in the Crimea, following the US led coup d&#39;etat in Kyiv, is fully consistent with this, as a logical, necessary DEFENSIVE counter-measure:</p>

<p>a) protecting the majority population of Crimea who are culturally/ethnic Russians, </p>

<p>b) securing the Black Sea Fleet home port of Sevastopol, </p>

<p>c) preventing the US from seizing the the large offshore natural gas reserves in the Black Sea. </p>

<p>Putin&#39;s actions in Syria, are similarly a logical, defensive measure to protect Russian interests in the region. Syria has been Russia&#39;s regional ally for decades, and the port city of Tartus in Syria is now Russia&#39;s only naval base outside of Russia. </p>

<p>Now, if you look at the Bushes, the Clintons, the Obamas etc, their international military interventions have not been &quot;patriotic&quot; in essence, or in long-term US strategic interests. They have been motivated by <strong>short-term profit for the US elite, the military-industrial complex, and strategic wishes of teh Jewish-American pro-Israeli lobby</strong>. The interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria etc etc have have not benefited the US (its people, its strategic long term interests) in any way whatsoever.</p>

I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re just being strategic (trying to avoid alienating possible supporters) or if you&#39;re actually in the dark when it comes to 9/11.<br/>

<p>Personally, 9/11 is such a shit show. I hate to say that but it&#39;s actually quite obvious that because it&#39;s been twisted up in so many ways (<em>memorialized</em>, even) that I don&#39;t think the general population will ever really know what went down.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone is in the dark about it, either. Whatever repercussions seem to have resulted from 9/11 would&#39;ve come anyway.</p>

<p>You need to think about how powerful 9/11 is and how deeply rooted it is in American culture. It&#39;s literally become a icon. #NeverForget (NEVER FORGET, NEVER FORGET WHAT?)</p>

<p>It&#39;s just... if I were him I wouldn&#39;t mention it either. I&#39;m glad we&#39;ve got truthers for 9/11, but you guys seriously need to work on shedding the culture that celebrates it in the sickest way. </p>

I was contacted by one of the people who had run the Chanology campaign after I wrote a piece for Huffington Post in early 2010 predicting that it would eventually be capable of toppling governments. Later, when Anonymous involved itself in Tunisian uprising, he suggested I check out the server from which this was being done, and I started working with them.</p>

Right now, Russian propaganda outlets like RT and Sputnik promote my stuff because they know I&#39;m mostly the U.S.&#39;s problem, and rightly assume that we&#39;ll never gain any traction in Russia given that the populace there is essentially authoritarian anyway. That&#39;s a pretty common scenario, though; royal France supported American Revolution for similar reasons of sticking their chief enemy with troublesome internal uprisings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my question, I&#39;m not even sure we have a full understanding of the intelligence communities limitations based on their perceived resources.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t AES256 cracked by quantum computing? </p>

<p>Is it safe to say the survailence state has colluded with manufactures to build backdoors into the BIOS hardware? Is there any safe hardware now? I use Dd-wrt firmware on my routers, but Xfinity/Comcast doesn&#39;t allow me to put a custom firmware on my modem. VPN seems the only way to mitigate this, however I only went to college for 2 years and creating a fast stable VPN was complicated even for me and I have some training on it. Most home networks don&#39;t have resources or intelligence to create survailence state proof networks.</p>

<p>Microsoft&#39;s home group technology is garbage and it seems Active Directory is the way to go for home users, but the learning curve and costs prevent most home end users from using directory services to manage their home network.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a security expert, but I work for the health authority as network engineer. We spend a lot of time sandboxing data to see if it is compromised before we allow the end user to view it. But we have the resources to do it. Most consumer end users have no idea how to make safe data decisions with the consumer grade hardware.</p>

<p>How does the average end user begin building an anonymity set, how can they be sure their hardware hasn&#39;t been compromised?</p>

<p>its fascinating to think we can still maintain an anonymity set with limited resources.</p>

<p>TOR seems pointless if your the only one on your street (using it) as it can still be discovered via triangulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Barrett! Thank you for your sacrifice!</p>

<p>I have a question regarding Pursuance. I may be misunderstanding the fundamentals of your project, but it seems to be a platform for citizens to investigate, share, and discuss potential crimes not given proper attention (?). As I&#39;m sure you&#39;re familiar, Reddit was full of participation this past election cycle when it came to the story of <em>PizzaGate</em>, which had it&#39;s moments, but eventually faded to nonexistence, and is now labeled a prime example of &quot;Fake News&quot;. Now, as someone who actually looked into the topic in depth, and was quite surprised by the implications of past cases/coverups, I believe that PG8 actually has some merit to it, yet it is, in the public eye, a witch-hunt. My question is; would Pursuance filter potential &#39;investigations&#39;, and, if so, what would that process look like?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

I&#39;m still trying to figure out how they got to 900,000 in restitution. If you can&#39;t talk about this I understand. I&#39;m just really curious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Barrett, </p>

<p>I would like to know what you think about the Matt DeHart case and it&#39;s latest developments of trying to keep him in jail an extra year by discounting his time served in Canada.  Also, what can supporters do for those that are behind bars?  What did you wish you received more of (letters, books, cash at the commissary?).</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think this reasoning has any value Mr. Brown (I mean in the abstract as I personally have nothing against transgender persons--however, the ideologies used to prop up such phenomena do strike me as very redolent of Frankfurt School theorizing, in their reverse): To quote from this article on the &#39;White Horse Dialogue&#39;: &quot;To use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes is not as good as using a nonattribute to show that attributes are not attributes. To use a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to show that a horse is not a horse, Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand things are one horse.&quot; The non-woman is argued to be a woman, thus ultimately undermining the social reality of woman as independent biological reproductive existent and force, a phenomenon which still anthropologically translates into the coherent and operable concepts and units of womanhood that have so facilely, in conjunction with empirical scientific advances, materialized into the world&#39;s present human population dynamics and numbers.</p>

<p>&quot;The ten thousand [transgender etiologies] are one [woman].&quot;
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_a_white_horse_is_not_a_horse">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_a_white_horse_is_not_a_horse</a></p>

<p>The logical purpose of such illogicality would be natal population control wherever needed: control the logic, control the process, control the empirical outcomes. Traditionally defined biological women and men in their impoverished billions are thus rendered into an amorphous, pullulating blob or chaff called bare life, a human biological terra nullia; what Italian philosopher Agamben has called &#39;Homo Sacer&#39;: the barest human life, the intrinsic organization (and therefore rights) of which is unrecognized and/or unperceived by the advancing liberal ethos of transgender and related non-empirically-based illusory &quot;rights.&quot; Such are the future ghost people who will inherit the lands of the biological ones presently treated or declared as ghosts, inexistents, etrangeres in their natal lands; the same logical legerdemain that argues that the Palestinian people do not and never have existed is operative in the declarations that &quot;the ten thousand things are one horse;&quot; &quot;the ten thousand foreign origins of Israeli Jews is one single origin that surmounts that of the non-existent autochthonous Palestinians;&quot; it is the logic that seeks to make biological women strangers to/within their own bodies and social spaces.</p>

<p>So my question is about trying to dumb down Pursuance a little bit more.</p>

<p>So is it basically a social networking type platform where there is someone who creates a “group” and that group will have some sort of ID that will be set and able to give to others requesting permission to that “group”? Kinda like Discord but for face-to-face or is it IRC or voice chat? Also, to make it even more simple and dumbed down, will it be like Discord to an extent?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good criticism that we are taking to heart -- we need to explain Pursuance in simpler terms.</p>

<p>Pursuance will launch with these features: task management (you can assign tasks to people and give them due dates), chat, and file-sharing.</p>

<p>I talk about this, and much more, in my giant answer to many questions here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/742kz4/im_barrett_brown_journalistactivist_who_did_4/dnvf865/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/742kz4/im_barrett_brown_journalistactivist_who_did_4/dnvf865/</a></p>

I really like the concept of this, and can see that the need for this will be basically anywhere where there is file sharing and/or anonymity is a must, want, or need to spread or share information. I can see myself creating a Pursuance for a few different reasons, or even joining them as well.</p>

<p>Last question, very simple: One Pursuance can be connected with another to an extent, right? I think I saw it somewhere but just wanted to double check.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, soon you&#39;ll be able to create a task within one pursuance and assign it to another pursuance.  Participants of each of those pursuances who have sufficient privileges will be able to view/comment on/collaborate around that shared task and any sub-tasks it is broken down into.</p>

<p>Relatedly, the first people we invite to make accounts within our Pursuance System server will form a talent pool of activists, journalists, researchers, academics, and more that pursuances will be able to draw from.</p>

<p>We&#39;re always trying to think of more ways that pursuances can collaborate/share resources/etc in the future, so let us know if there&#39;s any other promising ways you can think of!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of our code is open source and free to use, and Pursuance is now officially a non-profit.</p>

<p>Our instance of the Pursuance System will be free to use.  We are thinking about becoming financially self-sustaining through support contracts, training sessions for non-profits and companies who want to use Pursuance to make their staff more effective, dual licensing (so that companies can fund our software development if they want to add features to Pursuance that they don&#39;t contribute back), enabling large nonprofits to directly take donations via their pursuance hosted on our server, setting groups up with their own Pursuance server for a small fee, a combination of the above, or perhaps some other ways we&#39;ve yet to think of (ideas welcome! <a href="https://twitter.com/PursuanceProj">@PursuanceProj</a>).</p>

<p>First we&#39;re doing a crowdfunding campaign in the next couple months so we can build out the full, epic vision of Pursuance, so stay tuned!</p>

One obvious way (that you probably already know) would be to make it so anyone can donate. Other than that I’m not sure right now. I will definitely be using this though for whatever reasons.

    <div class="md"><p>You have said this is the age of the nonstate actor. I believe you explained that you meant this is the age of individuals making changes.  </p>

<p>I however read it like a lawyer – this is the age of privatization.  </p>

<p>Not just outsourcing deep state intelligence to for-profit corps. but pretty much every other governmental function too, e.g., Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), which is slowly figuring out profits are higher from electronic monitoring and GPS devices than private prisons. </p>

<p>And federal courts are employing private collection agencies to collect things like, for instance, restitution.</p>

<p>The Department of Education is doing the same thing with student loans.</p>

<p>This makes lots of money for corps. and de facto removes constitutional protections for individuals since a private party can&#39;t violate your constitutional rights. (Well, there is some old case law that says if a private company is performing a government function they can, but appellate courts don&#39;t bother with it anymore). </p>

<p>So as far as I can tell we really do have a corporatocracy.  Will Pursuance end that?  Individuals making changes? </p>

But they can demand that phone providers do it and store it and give it to them on demand.  not only are they technically not doing this spying, but they don&#39;t even have to pay the private company to in effect do it on their behalf.</p>

<p>There really seems to be a running theme in these intelligence communities that what they are doing is so important it puts them above any sort of law and the constitution itself is just this pesky thing to be circumvented wherever it inhibits them from pursuing their secret agendas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, actually by the time they subpoena the ISP or  phone provider, in my experience, they have already used malware or some sort of illegal surveillance device to identify your IP address. From that they can find out your provider and then simply serve an administrative subpoena on the provider to get your identifying information. They then use this as probable cause to obtain search warrants for your phone or computer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually pretty impressed he was able to get enough Subs to last him the entire 4 years in prison. Quite honestly, if Subs were allowed in prison (monitored by a doctor), they wouldn&#39;t have such a big problem with people sneaking in Oxys and Heroin. There&#39;s really no way for someone to &quot;cheek&quot; suboxone as they are dissolvable strips you put under your tongue. </p>

This may have caused a vacuum of more left leaning voices on popular forums. Could you speak to this, and how has the popularity of these views affected people in your circles? Has it fractured any groups or created conflict?</p>

The questions to be asking are: What does it mean when the government professes to be protecting the public from terrorism while also spending over a billion dollars promoting al-Qaeda/ISIS in Syria while lying to the public about it through their colluding media? 
What does it mean when the government and media pretend to care about human lives here in the USA while encouraging their terrorists to take over half a million lives (kids, families, elderly people, gay, brown, white, all religions) in Syria? What faith should we hold in our government that they didn&#39;t do this? Why the cognitive dissonance? Is it possible that its all about control? Who benefits from all the deception and killing? Cui Bono? </p>
