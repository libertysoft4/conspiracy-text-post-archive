    <div class="md"><p>Let me explain this to you... This is a passage from the movie the Matrix. The protagonist Neo is having a revelation about the world he lives in, in the movie the Conspiracy is that machines have taken humanity and put them in a virtual prison that they can&#39;t escape because they don&#39;t know they are imprisone they don&#39;t know they are slaves to the machine. </p>

<p>This is a parallel to a known Conspiracy in our world, instead of machines we have banks , instead of robots we have people act as robots, we have mass media brainwash people to let them believe they are free, but like in the movies we are all slaves we are bound by birth to a country made to work for a system of control... Tell me can you live with out money? That is the cage that you can&#39;t see.</p>

<p>Alright.<br/>
It&#39;s not my personal idea of a conspiracy, everything being done is pretty deliberate and in the light of day, the people just don&#39;t care. Then you could say there&#39;s a conspiracy to not have people care, but I don&#39;t know where the line is between taking advantage of a system to their benefit and a conspiracy is.</p>

Example sombody planning a surprise birthday party and gets a bunch of people to conspire with them to surprise the birthday person is a conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>All great answers so far.</p>

<p>You simply stop taking most things at face value that you swallowed willingly in the past. Also, you tend not to reach conclusions quickly (if ever), and keep an open mind towards possibilities. It may seem like our minds are skewed towards the corrupt and negative (basically, the idea that &quot;everything&#39;s a conspiracy, man!&quot;), but most of the critical thinkers out there do not reach conclusions quickly and keep digging for answers. </p>

<p>That more individuals would realize their eternal-divine nature and live their temporal-physical lives in wholeness with their eternal-divine selves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first thing that would happen would be silence. Everyone&#39;s jaw would hang agape, because suddenly they would realize they have been lied to. Then they would dig, just a little open minded research, and realize they have not only been lied to, but that  they have also been played. Next would most likely be a crossroads, either anger and motivation to do something, or denial mixed with apathy. Change is so hard, especially if things are comfy and cozy. In a mass awakening, it would be easier to choose the path of action, since the group/masses are choosing that route. An instant support system of like-minded people helps spur an individual onward. It&#39;s harder when one is acting with no support system, and has no person to person contact with someone who is open to your views. Probably why some of us are here at the moment.....</p>

<p>In a mass awakening, I would hope for a clear vision of the truth. There are many conspiracies to delve into, some are crap and some have substance. It takes work to muddle through it all, and at the moment we seem gullible and lazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being awake is to give up attachment. Most conspiracy theorists, as most people, are not awake. They still go about their lives taking part in the consumption of resources in ways that are harmful to the very environment in which we live. Being awake is to leave that mindset and live a different paradigm. 
A much better question is what does it mean to be asleep? Or how do you become awake?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There would be no media virtual reality.</p>

<p>When a presenter uses a tone of voice like &quot;everyone else is thinking and saying this too&quot;, make a point of wondering why simple facts aren&#39;t enough to mention and take it as a sign of fudging narrative with reality, which is necessarily is. Then make a note how much of this fudge of bullshit and spin there is in the content of every outlet on all sides of politics, and that it plays the major role in defense and attack on literally every issue, and that nobody with their hand on its levers can avoid doing their utmost to game it.</p>

<p>Most of the bullshit does not cancel out since a whole range of agendas are excluded for the simple reason that they have no access to the mentioned levers. The result is that the masses get a distorted view of the world which is slanted against truth appreciated by national &quot;enemies&quot; as well as domestic truth unappreciated by the power classes.</p>

<p>If everyone woke up then the next day would not be a continuation of that nightmare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I personally wouldn&#39;t tell people they <em>need</em> to wake up, if the process is forced, it will cause issues. </p>

<p>Second, everyone will not wake up suddenly, it is an individual process, so I&#39;ll have to ignore the second part of your question.</p>

<p>The best answer I can provide is that; &quot;Waking up&quot; is an <em>individual</em> experience. It&#39;s meaning <em>and</em> process will vary from person to person.</p>

<p>For the most part &quot;Waking up&quot; has a few different stages. I&#39;ll try to give a brief, slightly half-assed rundown.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Sleep -The state most people start at in life. Believing most things you are told, and trusting your senses.</p></li>
<li><p>Realization - Starting to realize there is more to life/reality than &#39;meets the eye&#39;.</p></li>
<li><p>Pre-Awakening - Starting to actively learn more about &#39;the way things work&#39; </p></li>
<li><p>Awakening - This is the stage when you are officially &quot;waking up&quot; and you KNOW &#39;in your bones&#39; that there is more than &#39;meets the eye&#39;, whether that be political, metaphysical, spiritual, etc. It can be different for everyone, like I said previously.</p></li>
<li><p>REPEAT - The stages basically start over as you continue to awaken more/further/deeper. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I wish there was a one-size-fits-all answer. But there just isn&#39;t. Waking up is a personal and individual experience, although most people would agree; we would all be better people if we were more aware of the world around us, and within us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Realizing life isn&#39;t a cartoon with constant drama and entertainment, like it&#39;s presented. Realizing how FUCKING STUPID everything really is, like war, consuming products etc. It&#39;s so, so stupid. It only takes ONE moment to focus and think out loud: Why are people so quick to trust someone just because they&#39;re &quot;famous&quot;? Why do people see &quot;famous&quot; people as &quot;hot&quot;? All they are is carefully chosen regular humans that are filmed with an electric box, to be streamed into other electric boxes.
