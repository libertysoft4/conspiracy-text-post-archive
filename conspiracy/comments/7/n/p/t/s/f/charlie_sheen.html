<p>Seems like a logical religious person to me, albeit I only looked into him for 10-15 mins.</p>

<p>For instance, he renounces his part in Two and Half Men and claims television can be dangerous (and that Two and Half Men is subjecting yourself to &#39;filth&#39; and you shouldnt watch it)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The proliferation of abrahamic religions throughout history is probably the biggest conspiracies ever,  which makes its dissapointing to see so many people in a conspiracy sub still under the effects of the indoctrination. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was <strong>just</strong> talking to someone close about this and had a pretty good dialogue about the difference between literalism, inerrancy and a more logical approach to biblical text, and in general, the Abrahamic religion.  Although in all religion one will find a mix of interpretations...this is the field of hermeneutics</p>

<p>So the Noah&#39;s arc story is not literal and is like an allegory for something else....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Er.  You are missing the point.  Some interpret that as all allegorical.</p>

<p>After all most religious texts are just recast from earlier more ancient stories.  There seems to be a common source for this information / knowledge.  It&#39;s as if this knowledge was better preserved (in the past) through allegory rather than a bulleted list of lessons / virtues / whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I am the shallow minded one for not taking the bible seriously, despite it being riddled with contradictions and nonsense.</p>

<p>You on the other hand, are projecting your mental gymnastics onto me, who is truly trying to open your mind to the value of a book that contains ancient knowledge in the form of allegory.  It was written by many people, and is basically a clumping of stories recast.  You don&#39;t want to go through the trouble of doing any hard work it seems.

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes to bullshit, big-time, major league bullshit, you have to stand in awe of the all-time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims, religion. No contest. No contest. Religion. Religion easily has the greatest bullshit story ever told. Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people that there&#39;s an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever &#39;til the end of time! But He loves you. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He&#39;s all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can&#39;t handle money! Religion takes in billions of dollars, they pay no taxes, and they always need a little more. Now, you talk about a good bullshit story. Holy Shit!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quoting someone else&#39;s opinion on something = not critical enough to form your own thoughts....logic!</p>

<p>But I digress, let&#39;s summarise your current position for further analysis.</p>

<p>Organised religion is terrible,  but the bible itself is great and should be respected separately despite the fact that if emperor Constantine didn&#39;t use Christianity as a tool to control the masses, expand the Roman empire and make a fortune, you would have never heard of the bible.</p>

<p>Also Christianity is valid because the bible tells us the story of jesus&#39; life, how he is the saviour and the son of God and all the supernatural abilities he had (as mentioned before)....</p>

<p>...but everything before or after that is immune to criticism because it&#39;s all stories and powerful allegories and symbolism , and really it&#39;s deep and complex mystical ancient knowledge that is definitely relevant in 2018.</p>

<p>Ancient knowledge such as...</p>

<p>&quot;A bowl of vegetables with someone you love is better than steak with someone you hate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Don&#39;t imagine that I (jesus) came to bring peace to the earth! I came not to bring peace, but a sword.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Got hrough the city after him and strike, do not let your eye have pity and do not spare. Utterly slay old men, young men, maidens, little children, and women“</p>

<p>&quot;After having sex, both the man and the woman must take a bath, but they still remain unclean until evening&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;he took the foreskins to the king, and counted them all out to him, so he might become his son in law&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and touched Moses&#39; feet with it&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;she lusted after lovers with genitals as large as a donkey&#39;s and emissions like those of a horse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;so whenever he had sexual relations with his brother&#39;s wife, he would spill his semen on the ground to avoid fathering offspring for his brother. this displeased the lord so he was put to death&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a day of sabbath rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it is to be put to death&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If a priest&#39;s daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she disgraces her father; she must be burned in the fire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;and not to the people sitting on the wall--who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, he shall pay her father fifty pieces of silver. She is to become his wife, because he forced her to have intercourse. He can never divorce her as long as he lives&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No man whose testicles have been crushed or whose penis has been cut off may participate in the assembly of the lord.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The demons begged Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”&quot;</p>

<p>I stand by my original statement that logical religious person is an oxymoron. </p>
