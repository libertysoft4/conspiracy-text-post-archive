        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Bohemian Grove Owl = In Greek mythology, a little owl (Athene noctua) traditionally represents or accompanies Athena, the virgin goddess of wisdom, or Minerva, her syncretic incarnation in Roman mythology.[1] Because of such association, the bird — often referred to as the &quot;owl of Athena&quot; or the &quot;owl of Minerva&quot; — has been used as a symbol of knowledge, wisdom, perspicacity and erudition throughout the Western world.</p>

<p>Baphomet= In Greek religion and mythology, Pan (/pæn/;[1] Ancient Greek: Πάν, Pan) is the god of the wild, shepherds and flocks, nature of mountain wilds and rustic music, and companion of the nymphs.[2] He has the hindquarters, legs, and horns of a goat, in the same manner as a faun or satyr. With his homeland in rustic Arcadia, he is also recognized as the god of fields, groves, and wooded glens; because of this, Pan is connected to fertility and the season of spring. </p>

<p>The ancient Greeks also considered Pan to be the god of theatrical criticism and impromptus.[3] The word &quot;panic&quot; is a tribute to the god. Pan, God of nature, the wild, shepherds, flocks, of mountain wilds, and is often associated with sexuality Symbol-Pan flute, In the 18th and 19th centuries, Pan became a significant figure in the Romantic movement of western Europe and also in the 20th-century Neopagan movement.</p>

<p>Greek Goddess of Wisdom and War. Athena, also referred to as Athene, is a very important goddess of many things. She is goddess of wisdom, courage, inspiration, civilization, law and justice, strategic warfare, mathematics, strength, strategy, the arts, crafts, and skill.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minerval_insignia.png">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minerval_insignia.png</a></p>

<p>This is the original insignia of the Bavarian Illuminati. It pictures the owl of Minerva - symbolising wisdom - on top of an opened book.</p>

<p>Minerva was the Roman goddess of wisdom, medicine, commerce, handicrafts, poetry, the arts in general, and later, war. In many ways similar to the Greek goddess Athena, she had important temples in Rome and was patron of the Quinquatras festival.</p>

<p>In the mystery cults of the highly syncretic Hellenistic era,[18] Pan is made cognate with Phanes/Protogonos, Zeus, Dionysus and Eros. Accounts of Pan&#39;s genealogy are so varied that it must lie buried deep in mythic time. Like other nature spirits, Pan appears to be older than the Olympians, if it is true that he gave Artemis her hunting dogs and taught the secret of prophecy to Apollo. Pan is famous for his sexual powers, and is often depicted with a phallus. Diogenes of Sinope, speaking in jest, related a myth of Pan learning masturbation from his father, Hermes, and teaching the habit to shepherds.</p>

<p>Representations of Pan on 4th century BC gold and silver Pantikapaion coins</p>

<p>Athena, and Hephaestus are worshipped together. Athena as the Goddess of Wisdom, and War, and Hephaestus as the Creator of the great weapons of war for Gods, and Men. Hephaestus was the God of Fire and the Forge, the patron god of smiths, craftsmen, sculptors and artisans. He was the weapon maker of the Gods. In Greek mythology, Hephaestus was the son of Zeus and Hera, the king and queen of the gods. In another version, he was Hera&#39;s parthenogenous child, rejected by his mother because of his deformity and thrown off Mount Olympus and down to earth. As a smithing god, Hephaestus made all the weapons of the gods in Olympus.</p>

<p>Screen shot from the video &quot;Inside The Bohemian Club.&quot;</p>

<p>As one can plainly see by the above comparison, the owl statue, situated within the library at the Bohemian Club headquarters in San Francisco, is an exact replica of the one at the Acropolis – thus, there is no doubt that the &quot;Bohos&quot; (by duplicating a famous statue located at the chief temple dedicated to Athena) are alluding to Athena/Minerva, or the goddess of wisdom. Furthermore, the statue in the Bohemian Club has a plaque on its front base, stating: &quot;Replica of Ancient Athenian Owl&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/images/2009/MinervaOwl/bennettMinerva.jpg">http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/images/2009/MinervaOwl/bennettMinerva.jpg</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s also the tale of Minerva and Arachne (Greek for spider). It concerns a weaving contest between Minerva – also known as the goddess of the arts, needle work and weaving – and Arachne. The latter was turned into a spider after losing the contest. &quot;Weaving Spiders Come Not Here,&quot; the motto on the seal of the Bohemian Club, may well be alluding to the myth; the mere fact that it is accompanied by the owl, which represents Minerva, is significant and noteworthy (and too semiotically sound as to have been a mere coincidence).</p>

<p>Minerval Seals of the Illuminati: two of three known to still exist. P.M.C.V. stands for Per Me Caeci Vident (Through me the blind become sighted). An owl holding an opened book (signifying learning), surrounded by a Laurel wreath (a symbol of learning or graduation); Per Me Caeci Vident was a reminder to the Superiors of the class, whose responsibility it was to properly instruct the Minervals. These medallions were worn around the necks of Minerval initiates.</p>

<p>The class of Minerval was a relatively low rank in the scheme of things. However, it was the soul of the Order, and functioned as a sort of assembly line for recruits.</p>

<p>Candidates advanced from Novice to the Minerval degree, where they were properly vetted, scrutinized, and indoctrinated. The Quibus Licet notebooks were introduced, maintained and thoroughly kept (which eventually turned into a detailed history of yourself and those around you). You were admonished to gain wisdom from figures in ancient Greece and Rome; essays were required to pass the test; and the art of Scrutator (or Physiognomy) was elevated to a sacred science. The Minerval Superior – a Minor or Major Illuminatus – was given the code: Nosce te ipsum; Nosce alios [Know thyself; Know others].
Minerval Church SealA Minerval Academy was also known as a Church; its meetings marked on the Illuminati&#39;s calendar as sacred. To the right is the seal of the Freising Minerval Church. Instead of the letters P.M.C.V., they are replaced with S.E.M.T.: Sigil Ecclesiastic Minerva Thebes; or, &quot;Seal of the Freising Minerval Church&quot; (i.e. Freising&#39;s alias within the Order was Thebes).
Another layer of the owl symbolism, was to assure its initiates that the Illuminati does its bidding at night: nocturnal toil (see Perfectibilists: The 18th Century Bavarian Order of the Illuminati It harkens back to the tradition of night the &quot;mother of counsels.&quot; Desiderius Erasmus, for instance, recorded the Latin adage: In nocte consilium [Night is the mother of counsel]. Apparently, the lesson is to be cautious or prudent, not to undertake a thing impulsively (&quot;sleep on it&quot;). Indeed, for one of the maxims the Illuminati had given to the Minervals, was: Quidquid agis, age prudente et respice finem [Whatever you do, do cautiously, and be mindful of the end] (Perfectibilists, op. cit., p. 227 n. 33).</p>

<p>Pan is the universal agent known as phosphorus, that gives light and life to the world. In Lévi&#39;s writings, the Baphomet does not only express a historical-political tradition, but also occult natural forces that are explained by his magical theory of the Astral Light. Lévi called his image &quot;The Goat of Mendes&quot;, possibly following Herodotus&#39; account that the god of Mendes—the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt—was depicted with a goat&#39;s face and legs. Herodotus relates how all male goats were held in great reverence by the Mendesians, and how in his time a woman publicly copulated with a goat.</p>

<p>At several places in the Delta, e.g. Hermopolis, Lycopolis, and Mendes, the god Pan and a goat were worshipped; Strabo, quoting (xvii. 1, 19) Pindar, says that in these places goats had intercourse with women, and Herodotus instances a case which was said to have taken place in the open day. The Mendisians, according to this last writer, paid reverence to all goats, and more to the males than to the females, they call both Pan and the goat Mendes, and both were worshipped as gods of generation and fecundity. Diodorus compares the cult of the goat of Mendes with that of Priapus, and groups the god with the Pans and the Satyrs. The goat referred to by all these writers is the famous Mendean Ram, or Ram of Mendes, the cult of which was, according to Manetho, established by Kakau, the king of the IInd dynasty.Lévi called his image &quot;The Goat of Mendes&quot;, possibly following Herodotus&#39; account that the god of Mendes—the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt—was depicted with a goat&#39;s face and legs.</p>

<p>Baphomet is a term originally used to describe an idol or other deity that the Knights Templar were accused of worshipping and that subsequently was incorporated into disparate occult and mystical traditions.</p>

<p>33rd degree Freemason, Manly P. Hall had said in the Secret Teachings of All Ages;“Pan was a composite creature, the upper part–with the exception of his horns–being human, and the lower part in the form of a goat. ” According to Hall, the symbolism of the goat relates to the pre-Christian God Pan, Dionysius. </p>

<p>The Goat-God was accepted by the later Greek Mystery Schools as the symbol of the Temple Builders. In fact, the Dionysian Artificers was such a mystery school. They viewed practical Temple Construction as a source of understanding the mystery of Nature and God; thus being one of the early esoteric schools from which Masonry has inherited certain symbols and teachings.</p>

<p>Another famous 33rd Degree Scottish Rite Freemason, Albert Pike had written in Moral and Dogma, in describing the 28th degree; &quot;The Gnostics held that it [universal agent] composed the igneous [pertaining to fire] body of the Holy Spirit, and it was adored in the secret rites of the Sabbat or the Temple under the hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet or the hermaphroditic goat of Mendes.&quot; Pike further stated; &quot;&quot;... Satan is not a black god, but negation of God ... this is not a Person, but a Force, created for good, but which may represent evil. It is the instrument of Liberty or Free Will. They represent this Force; under the mythologic and horned form of the God Pan; thence came the he-goat of the Sabbat, brother of the Ancient Serpent, and the Light-bearer.&quot;
And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. </p>

<p>God bestowed upon Moses a copper serpent that was to be attached to a stick and used for curative purposes. The mythical Greek character Hermes also carried a serpent stick called the “Caduceus” that was divinely bestowed upon him, and which became the worldwide symbol of the medical profession. . But, of course, it is also true that Moses had another “serpent stick” that he carried on his missions to bring God’s messages to the Pharaoh.</p>

<p>We are told by Jewish sources such as the writer Eupolemus, who wrote about 150 BC, that the alphabet was invented by Moses while, according to Greek sources, the same alphabet was invented by Hermes. The Egyptian Hermes -- whom they called “Thoth” -- is credited with inventing hieroglyphic writing while the Babylonian Hermes, whom they called “Nebo,” is credited with inventing cuneiform writing. Nebo, a word that means the “Prophet,” was a common nickname for Moses, and when Moses died he was buried upon Mount Pisgah which is also called, no doubt in memory of Moses, Mount Nebo.</p>

<p>Needless to say Moses was a prolific writer of sacred texts. In this regard Hermes was apparently no slouch either. So-called Hermetic books dealing with the religion of Egypt were mentioned by Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Porphyry, and Jamblichus. Since Clement even says that the books of Hermes were carried by the Egyptians in religious processions, one surely wonders if they were kept in an ark like the law of Moses during the religious processions of the Israelites. However well known these Hermetic writings were in ancient times, it wasn’t until the middle of the 15th century that some of these previously lost Hermetic texts had supposedly been found in the libraries of the Byzantine Empire. Suspect though they are, these books are accredited to the semi-mythical figure named Hermes Trismegistus (thrice greatest) whom the Gnostics insist, while not being Moses himself, was a contemporary of his.
an ever present characteristic of any image of Hermes is his petasos, a cap which featured a wide circular brim. The fact that this petasos looks, even to the casual observer, remarkably like the halo of a Christian saint may be a clue to it‘s origin. For the corona of Moses, which is Scripturally attested to at Exodus 34:30 (&quot;and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him&quot;), probably was represented pictorially as a circle around his head and, therefore, more than likely served as the origin of the petasos of Hermes.</p>

<p>Hermes also had another form of headgear that was intended to hide him, known as the cap of darkness or the helmet of invisibility. We know this because, according to Hyginus from his Astronomica (2.12), he once loaned it to Perseus: “Perseus ... received from Hermes, ... petasos, and, in addition, a helmet which kept its wearer from being seen ... the helmet of Hades (the Unseen One)...” Moses also had a headdress that he wore for the purpose of hiding his face. His corona was frightening to people so he used a veil to conceal it, as explained in the book of Exodus at 34:33: &quot;And until Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.&quot;</p>

<p>Hermes is often depicted as wearing winged sandals, but the Greeks would certainly know enough not to take this literally. The Greeks would understand that traveling upon wings was merely symbolic and meant nothing more than going swiftly. Moses was sent to deliver the Israelites upon eagles wings as at Exodus 19:4: &quot;You have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles&#39; wings, and brought you unto myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Casting of Lots
Among the Greeks Hermes was considered to be the inventor of casting lots as a method of divination, but Moses also instructed the Hebrews, at a very early date, in the use of lots to divine the will of God. The iconoclastic Moses taught that no images should be made and, accordingly, there is some evidence that Hermes too was at first an iconoclast.</p>

<p>The name of Hermes originated in the Greek word “herma” meaning a “stone heap” -- probably from the custom of erecting a “herm” consisting of an upright stone surrounded at its base by a heap of smaller stones. These unpretentious monuments were often used as landmarks for travelers or to mark territorial boundaries. A mythical origin for these stone heaps may also be understood for, to quote from the Etymologicum Magnum, “when Hermes killed Argos, he was brought to trial by the gods. They acquitted him, and in doing so each threw his voting-pebble at his feet. Thus a heap of stones grew up around him.” </p>

<p>The point here being that the more recent images of Hermes result from apostasies of his earliest teachings, and that the original icon of Hermes, namely, the modest stone heap, was indeed one that would have been acceptable to even Israel himself. Notice Genesis 31:45-46: &quot;And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap.&quot;</p>

<p>Moses taught that one out of every seven days was to be revered as holy and called the Sabbath, while Hermes also took one day out of the seven, calling it Wednesday after his name.</p>

<p>I was not the first one to identify Moses with Hermes. In fact, this was noticed thousands of years ago -- at least as early as the second (some think that he could possibly have lived in the third) century BC -- by the Egyptian priest Artapanus who some think may have been Jewish. Eusebius (ix. 27) quoted from a lost book that was written by Artapanus and called Concerning the Jews that said of Moses “he was beloved by the Egyptians, who called him Hermes, (dia tên tôn‘ierôn gramattôn‘ermêneian).” The Greeks themselves seem to corroborate Artapanus by admitting that the Ibis headed Egyptian god Thoth was just another version of their god Hermes. The Greeks even tell a story of how Hermes had come up out of the land of Egypt where he once had lived disguised as an Ibis. Similar to the Hebrew Scriptures the followers of Moses, in the story told by Artapanus, were plagued by poisonous serpents. </p>

<p>However, the Moses of Artapanus (instead of the copper serpent) employed the Ibis to attack the snakes. This was the reason, Artapanus says, for which Moses/Hermes revered the Ibis so. If Hermes was Moses, as Artapanus states, and Moses was a younger contemporary of Inachus the father of Io, as cited by the ancient chronologists, then it is very conceivable that the Hermes in the story of Io’s wanderings is a mythic Greek version of Moses in the Hebrew story about the wandering Jews.</p>

<p>The earthly wife of god was in bondage, so god sent his serpent stick carrying messenger -- on eagle’s wings -- to lead her out of her captivity. The messenger of god smote the head of her captor and delivered the Earthly wife of god. Did he lead her directly home? No, this is when she went on her famous wanderings, known to the Greeks as the wanderings of Io. There was a mystifying cloud cover, a gadfly plague, and a miraculous water crossing. She gave birth to the &quot;Egyptian&quot; calf god, &quot;Epaphus&quot; (Apis). But, most telling of all, she approached the special mountain where the creator of mankind was bound, and talked to him. Prometheus told Io that she could expect the savior to be born to her, as one of her descendants, thirteen generations hence. After all this she finally returned to her homeland, Phoronea.</p>

<p>“Prometheus told Io that she could expect the savior to be born to her, as one of her descendants, thirteen generations hence.” This point, overlooked by many, is exceptionally strong evidence for equating the Greek and Hebrew traditions. A quote from Prometheus Bound (a play by Aeschylus, who wrote as early as 500 BC) runs thus: “PROMETHEUS: She (a future wife of Zeus) will bear to him a child, And he shall be in might more excellent Than his progenitor. IO: And he will find No way to fend off this strong stroke of fate? PROMETHEUS: None save my own self when these bonds are loosed. IO: And who shall loose them if Zeus wills not? PROMETHEUS: Of your own seed. IO: How says you? Shall a child of mine release thee? PROMETHEUS: Son of yours, but son the thirteenth generation shall beget. IO: A prophecy oracularly dark.” Is it not amazing how exactly -- down to the smallest details of theology -- that the Greek and Hebrew traditions match on this point? With the advent of this “savior” Prometheus would no longer be “bound” to the mountain.</p>

<p>How many stories do you know of where the creator of mankind will be released from his binding contract through the fulfillment of a prophecy predicting the future arrival of the son of god and the seed of a woman? (The story of Atlas is also remarkably similar but, as I hope the reader will come to realize, the two stories were intricately related.) The entire genealogy of the Greek savior -- all thirteen generations -- are known to this day as if it were the thirteen generations from Abraham to David! Can any other &quot;myths&quot; claim to pay such attention to the details of lineage?</p>

This is interesting as hell to me, because I don&#39;t really see Hermes/Thoth as evil, though I think the mystery religions have been hijacked for evil ends, a lot like most or all major religions.</p>

<p>Baphomet= In Greek religion and mythology, Pan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is nonsense. Baphomet is the name of the fictitious entity that the Inquisition forced the Knights Templar to confess to worshiping as justification for dismantling their order and seizing their wealth.</p>

<p>It was they reappropriated by Eliphas Levi in the 19th century in his occult writing as a representation of the source of occult knowledge, which he made up <em>whole cloth</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Albert Pike had written in Moral and Dogma, in describing the 28th degree; &quot;The Gnostics held that it [universal agent] composed the igneous [pertaining to fire] body of the Holy Spirit, and it was adored in the secret rites of the Sabbat or the Temple under the hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet or the hermaphroditic goat of Mendes.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pike is quoting directly from Levi, here, and in another section of Morals &amp; Dogma says, &quot;It is absurd to suppose that men of intellect adored a monstrous idol called Baphomet.&quot;</p>

<p>Levi is ultimately the root of all of this silliness, and to presume that anything he wrote had meaning outside of his own idiosyncratic system of symbolism would be entirely unfounded.</p>

<p>I seriously laughed out loud! That&#39;s the funniest thing I have ever heard! <strong><em>Albert Pike</em></strong> did not believe everything Albert Pike said. It would be impossible. He was fond of &quot;quoting&quot; (without attribution) many disparate sources, many of which were often contradictory. It would be logically impossible for anyone to believe everything Pike wrote, and on some points, I don&#39;t even agree with the sentiment that appeared to drive his points at a high level.</p>

<p>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to accept an idea without agreeing with it. I accept Pike&#39;s perspective, and I derive much from it that is valuable, but he and I do not always agree, nor would he have expected us to. If two people fully agree on all points of philosophy, then one of them is not engaging the material, but merely acquiescing to the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Crowley said pan is baphomet also.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Crowley said has no bearing on anything. Crowley relied on a fundamental principle of a specific style of occult teaching: that the meaning of the symbol is more important than the truth of its immediate form. That is, he was willing to literally lie, (one of his books drove this home, being titled, &quot;The Book of Lies&quot;) as long as the lie itself carried the meaning that he wanted to convey about what he considered to be important truths, and especially if the nature of the lie distracted those that he deemed unworthy of receiving the truth.</p>

<p>So... Crowley marks himself an unreliable narrator in all things, and I would represent that Levi was exactly where Crowley learned this, and he too should not be used as a source without very careful analysis of <em>why he presented something as truth</em>. You&#39;re taking a bunch of symbolic information, presented in order to illuminate ephemeral truths, and treating it as literal attestations of physical fact. Let me quote Pike quoting Plutarch to explain why this is a problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>says Plutarch, &quot;mistaking the sign for the thing signified, fell into a ridiculous superstition; while others, in avoiding one extreme, plunged into the no less hideous gulf of irreligion and impiety.&quot;</p>

Hymn to Pan by Aleister Crowley
Thrill with lissome lust of the light,
O man ! My man !
Come careering out of the night
Of Pan ! Io Pan .
Io Pan ! Io Pan ! Come over the sea
From Sicily and from Arcady !
Roaming as Bacchus, with fauns and pards
And nymphs and styrs for thy guards,
On a milk-white ass, come over the sea
To me, to me,
Coem with Apollo in bridal dress
(Spheperdess and pythoness)
Come with Artemis, silken shod,
And wash thy white thigh, beautiful God,
In the moon, of the woods, on the marble mount,
The dimpled dawn of of the amber fount !
Dip the purple of passionate prayer
In the crimson shrine, the scarlet snare,
The soul that startles in eyes of blue
To watch thy wantoness weeping through
The tangled grove, the gnarled bole
Of the living tree that is spirit and soul
And body and brain -come over the sea,
(Io Pan ! Io Pan !)
Devil or god, to me, to me,
My man ! my man !
Come with trumpets sounding shrill
Over the hill !
Come with drums low muttering
From the spring !
Come with flute and come with pipe !
Am I not ripe ?
I, who wait and writhe and wrestle
With air that hath no boughs to nestle
My body, weary of empty clasp,
Strong as a lion, and sharp as an asp-
Come, O come !
I am numb
With the lonely lust of devildom.
Thrust the sword through the galling fetter,
All devourer, all begetter;
Give me the sign of the Open Eye
And the token erect of thorny thigh
And the word of madness and mystery,
O pan ! Io Pan !
Io Pan ! Io Pan ! Pan Pan ! Pan,
I am a man:
Do as thou wilt, as a great god can,
O Pan ! Io Pan !
Io pan ! Io Pan Pan ! Iam awake
In the grip of the snake.
The eagle slashes with beak and claw;
The gods withdraw:
The great beasts come, Io Pan ! I am borne
To death on the horn
Of the Unicorn.
I am Pan ! Io Pan ! Io Pan Pan ! Pan !
I am thy mate, I am thy man,
Goat of thy flock, I am gold , I am god,
Flesh to thy bone, flower to thy rod.
With hoofs of steel I race on the rocks
Through solstice stubborn to equinox.
And I rave; and I rape and I rip and I rend
Everlasting, world without end.
Mannikin, maiden, maenad, man,
In the might of Pan.
Io Pan ! Io Pan Pan ! Pan ! Io Pan !</p>

<p>Well, for starters, neither Crowley nor Levi were Satanists. If you want to argue that Crowley wasn&#39;t a nice person, then I think there&#39;s plenty of evidence for that. If you want to argue that Levi was a bit unhinged, I think you could make that case reasonably. But just making things up isn&#39;t going to get you anywhere...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>admit to worshipping Baphomet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so that&#39;s absurd, but why do we care? If Levi made up his own deity out of scraps of lore from the inquisition of the Templars, then fine, let him! What does this have to do with anything?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The O.T.O. and others are connected to the Illuminati.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How, exactly? This is just arm-waving.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never even specifically brought Freemasonry into it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay... I mean, you did by talking about Morals &amp; Dogma and the 28th degree of the Scottish Rite, but okay, let&#39;s say you didn&#39;t. Why did you just bring it up now, then? I certainly didn&#39;t encourage it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Masons worship Lucifer/Prometheus, Apollo, Dionysus,etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sigh. No, they don&#39;t. First off, &quot;worship&quot; is something you do in Church. Freemasonry is a philosophical and initiatory order that teaches a set of moral lessons through symbolism and allegory.</p>

<p>Second, none of those characters are a part of the degrees. Not one of them.</p>

<p>The true name of Satan, the Kabalists say, is that of Yahveh reversed; for Satan is not a black God, but the negation of God. The Devil is the personification of Atheism or Idolatry. For the Initiates, this is not a person, but a force, created for good, but which may serve for evil. It is the instrument of Liberty or free will. They represent this Force, which presides over the physical generation, under the mythologic and horned form of the God Pan; thence the he-goat of the Sabbat, brother of the Ancient Serpent, and the light bearer or Phosphor, of which the poets have made the false Lucifer of the legend.”</p>

<p>According to the Kabalists, the true name of Satan is that of Yahveh reversed, for Satan is not a black god but the negation of Deity. He is the personification of Atheism and Idolatry. The devil is not a personality for initiates but a force created with a good object, though it can be applied to evil: it is really the instrument of liberty. They represented this force, which presides over physical generation, under the mythological figure of the horned god Pan, and hence comes the goat of the Sabbath, brother of the old Serpent, the light-bearer or phosphorus, converted by poets into the false Lucifer of the legend.”</p>

<p>a Satanist by definition, which admittedly is a term that varies widely, is a rebellious soul in defiance of everything that he or she opposes that restricts them. The only sin of a Thelemite is ‘restriction’ which is why I’ve always argued that we are in a sense a satanic breed. So, in my thinking, ‘Thelema’ and ‘Santanism’ are kindred souls, both questing for the same thing, i.e. Freedom from slave gods. So it would be redundant to use both terms together, no? However, if you define “Thelemic Satanist” as a person who thinks the modern Thelemic movement has sold itself out and gone wishy-washy-white-Light on us, then by all means use both terms to imply your defiance to those Thelemites who act more like closet Christians than soldiers of Freedom. In other words, “Thelemic Satanist” could then imply a rebellious Thelemite fighting against those who use the name (i.e. Thelemite) but act more like the slave gods imposing restriction on our Creed. The bottom line, to use the phrase or not – there is no law but do what thou wilt! 93 93/93.”                     -Jerry Edward Cornelius, </p>

You&#39;re taking a bunch of symbolic information, presented in order to illuminate ephemeral truths, and treating it as literal attestations of physical fact. Let me quote Pike quoting Plutarch to explain why this is a problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>says Plutarch, &quot;mistaking the sign for the thing signified, fell into a ridiculous superstition; while others, in avoiding one extreme, plunged into the no less hideous gulf of irreligion and impiety.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
