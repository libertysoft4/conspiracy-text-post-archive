<p>There&#39;s more to &quot;being a liberal&quot; than just wanting public services for yourself and legal weed. Wanting that stuff while still being a regressive shitlord just makes you a proto-fascist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, I was promised affordable Healthcare. If a comedian wants to make me laugh, they should bring up Obama&#39;s promises. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obamacare never promised to stop healthcare prices from rising, it promsied to slow down the rise, and it did. You&#39;ve been brainwashed to think either it promised more or that it failed to do that, probably from the same people who brainwashed you into thinking you&#39;re a &quot;liberal&quot; even as you use choice insults (&quot;libtard&quot;) that have only ever been the purview of the stupidest reaches of the right.</p>

<p>edit: I looked at some of your recent posts about the ACA and...yeah...other people did a fine job of explaining your misconceptions but the GOP propaganda (probably delivered by a &quot;centrist&quot; idiot like Joe Rogan so you could comprehend it) has apparently taken root deeply within your brain.</p>

<p>But hey, your guy won! Way to stick it to those LIBTARDS! Hur hur, they sure are crying, those snowflakes! You really showed them!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. It&#39;s not about him not supporting Trump. I&#39;m fine with that and wouldn&#39;t expect him to. It&#39;s just that his routine isn&#39;t funny because it&#39;s not congruent with reality. He said to give Trump a chance on SNL and used it as set-up for his new material where he paints a reality where after a year of Trump, he&#39;s a declared failure. Another perspective is that Trump has been wildly successful this year and your jokes are the real failure. It&#39;s not like Chappelle would even understand the politics of his fans. I don&#39;t want to hear Trump bashing anymore because it&#39;s become 95% of media. None of it is honest. None of it is funny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a difference.  I saw him live before he became famous and after he got back from Africa or whatever.  He&#39;s still funny, sure but the comedy is different.  Now that is huge on Netflix and they&#39;re pushing him, I&#39;m just kinda meh.. not a great comic these days.. Kinda like Sarah Silverman.. Used to be very funny.  Sold out to the elite.  Now her comedy is just shit and I&#39;m pretty sure she was using canned laughter in her last stand up special.  There&#39;s definitely something to be said for using entertainers to tell people what to think (stand up, family guy, SNL, etc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His style has changed for sure.</p>

<p>He&#39;s still funny, but it&#39;s pretty clear from &#39;The Bird Revelation&#39; that he&#39;s not as concerned with being funny as he is with sounding the warning and red pilling people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of strange that you&#39;re in a conspiracy forum and you&#39;re shitting on a dude with a huge audience who&#39;s spreading the message that it&#39;s time to stop being participating in a culture that turns all it&#39;s participants into Pimps, Prostitutes and Johns.</p>

&quot;Why does Dave&#39;s comedy seem different between ___<strong><em>&amp;</em></strong>____&quot; or some other way so people are not on auto downvote with your thread.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only seen one, but I thought it was refreshingly honest. I&#39;d go so far as to say that it was the only worthwhile standup set I&#39;ve seen in the past 5 years, as the current state of stand up comedy is at an all-time low. Unlike his contemporaries, Chappelle remains decisively anti-establishment, non-partisan, and anti-hypocrisy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I was taken aback by this latest show was how much he backtracked on his offending the trans community and his explanation of how he was mis-characterized as a Trump supporter.   He used to never give a shit but somehow, his tone has changed since his last Netflix special.  I don&#39;t know the reason for the change but I guess he got a lot of shit from the liberal media and critics.  </p>

<p>I only saw the first episode but the first half was genuinely funny.  The last half was just making sure people knew he voted for Hillary and that Trump is a dumb fuck.  And he ends with a story of how blacks overcame racism since the 50&#39;s and such.  Not exactly comedy.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about cloning and all that, but they don&#39;t allow you back in the mainstream after what he did and what he said when he came back (the Oprah interview, the Wesley Snipes comment on Letterman).</p>

<p>He had to pay a price to come back. Maybe they gave him an offer he couldn&#39;t refuse? His life, or selling his soul?</p>
