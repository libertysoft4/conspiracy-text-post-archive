        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m curious, because I think the shills and social engineers are aware of the voting psychology here. It&#39;s pretty simple, and unfortunately, I&#39;d be willing to bet a lot of people fall prey to this closed minded way of thinking;</p>

<p>-Id venture to guess many redditors think downvoted comment in the negatives automatically means it&#39;s a shit comment</p>

<p>-many people look at the vote tally first before reading the comment. If it&#39;s low, then they don&#39;t even bother reading</p>

<p>-inversely, anything upvoted must be a good submission that everyone agrees with.</p>

<p>Most of us I hope are able to understand that this is a extremely naive and stupid way of navigating reddit. <strong>astroturfing and paid dissent is not only present in this sub, it has become a part of it</strong></p>

<p>We need to be made aware of the irregular voting patterns/forum sliding tricks that the paid infiltrators use here. </p>

<p>Bottom line, read each comment before making a decision on how you feel about it. Don&#39;t just look at the vote tally and think,</p>

<p>&quot;Shucks! Everyone already did my thinkin&#39; for me! Downvoted!&quot;</p>

<p>Unless you constantly read/watch for content that is brand new, you&#39;re only getting to see what is allegedly popular. If it&#39;s been manipulated, they&#39;re making you think that you&#39;re seeing what is popular.</p>
