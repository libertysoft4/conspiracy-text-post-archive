They fulfill an agenda that runs so deep it has to reply on breaking the hopes and dreams of humanity in order to fulfill its own hopes and dreams.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This question what proof I would need is a problem. </p>

<p>I would i guess have to answer that in a way I would want said proof.</p>

<p>My MIND and Consciousness would have to be at ease i would say in order for what ever ( proof ) they would deliver. The proof in which they did however show/bring to our people? I don&#39;t believe it.</p>

<p>Why? My consciousness is uneasy and not convinced.
Sad but they the powers that be have made me this way.</p>

<p>Everything I knew as truth or was told as truth?
After 20 years of digging? Know to be a bad illusion of  his-story.
Someones else&#39;s truth or path.</p>

<p>The system teaches this everyday in our education system.
And it&#39;s a BLASPHEMY to ones inner core soul.</p>
