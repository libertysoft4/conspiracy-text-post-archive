    <div class="md"><p>So you consider sticking to the historical facts to be &quot;lefty&quot;? When you&#39;re among historians, your points need to be supportable with evidence and not just connecting dots that you&#39;ve made up...because then all you&#39;ve got are unsubstantiated theories which any uninformed person can come up with. There&#39;s a proper way to discuss the historical events that happened in Iran without unnecessarily going into your person opinion of Islam. Those opinions contribute nothing to the historical discussion and should be banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Asking why the women were free to dress how they wanted and not wear hijabs in the 50&#39;s photos of Iran compared to the photos of Iran today where women are forced to wear Hijab, is not bigotry and is entirely relevant to the sub.</p>

<p>They locked the thread because the left has sided with radical muslim Linda Sarsour who had the Pussy Hat women&#39;s march after trump one, and has been spreading a campaign that wearing a Hijab is empowering women. While women in Muslim countries feel that getting rid of the hijab is women&#39;s empowerment (As seen in the Iranian Protests where Women rip their Hijabs off for women&#39;s freedom)</p>

<p>So it makes sense the leftists who censor free speech locked the sub, because they are confused because they though Islam&#39;s Hijabs meant freedom, but it doesnt</p>

<p>because I used to be on the left, at occupy wallstreet, voted that way, and then watched in the last 5 years, the movement descend into some sort of anti-free speech, antifa terrorist, P.C. snowflake, 2000 genders, safe space, virtue signaling, feelings based, brain cancer of a movement.</p>

<p>If you you dig more into who is doing the deleting and censoring on Reddit, its leftists</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Wearing a hijab and telling women in the left to wear them too, in order to represent women&#39;s rights and women&#39;s power is the antithesis of what the Hijab stands for; an oppressive forced head covering imposed by radical Islamic sects.</p>

<p>She&#39;s also a terrorists Siraj Wajjah, co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, Islamist terrorist Rasmeah Odeh, Sami Al-Arian, Muslim Brotherhood, ISNA, CAIR, and many others.</p>

<p>Like WTF is wrong with the Left? How can anyone support a radical Islamist who actually supports terrorists, terrorist groups, and the Hijab which women in Islamic countries don&#39;t even want to wear and want to be free.</p>

<p>The Left is too far gone, so fucking sad man</p>

<p>Not because of a stereotype, but because of how I personally witnessed those around me descend into what I already described here:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This woman is a brainwashing propagandist tricking Millions in America. It is 100% in my heart to fight against these kinds of psyop agents that become a cancer in society, 100%. She is part of the further descent of the left. I would rather see the left rescued, become intelligent, independent, anti-gov, pro-constitution, kick out that radical elements and communist antifas, and so on.....so that they can evolve instead of the deevolution we have witnessed</p>

<p>Some of this is true, but to be fair, if its 100, then Obama and McCain wouldn&#39;t be making moves against Trump</p>

<p>On the other hand, someone like Sarsour, very well could be propped up and funded by whoever is behind the funding and spreading of Cultural Marxist movements, some say Soros. So in that case, its a legitimate concern and something that should be fought agisnt by the people </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fuck you on about tonight? It&#39;s an &quot;edit to add&quot; not an &quot;edit.&quot; As in, I asked a question then went and researched the answer for a bit as objectively as I could for myself, then came back to add to the discussion. Between that and the fact it&#39;s fucking New Year&#39;s Eve, which means there are other things occupying my attention, so sorry if my time stamps or whatever the fuck methodology it is you use to judge how much time I spend writing and editing my texts doesn&#39;t jive with your sense of what&#39;s kosher.</p>

<p>Dude, in all honesty, I didn&#39;t doubt it one bit when I first read Ops title and if it had been accurate with it&#39;s implication that would be pretty gross.  But I asked the most pertinent question I could think of, one that Op should have thought of and answered with his submission. Now that question still isn&#39;t answered and upon viewing the topic for myself it appears Op is at best karma whoring and at worst spreading bullshit that essentially equates to divisive propaganda.  </p>

<p>Happy New Years.</p>

<p>that&#39;s because it made the front page, and I was expecting it. Thing is, its not karma whoring cause I realy dont give a fuck about some made up internet points that I cant pay the bills with, so if that&#39;s the delusion you want to stick with and belief fuly, you are more than welcome to do that,</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you simply search on reddit or google previous threads that have been locked by r/history, r/worldnews, the front page, and so on, you will see this is a thing and has been a thing for quite a while, especially anything that has to do with Islam. Actually I dare you to make snarky remark about Islam in any of the posts in r/worldnews that has to do with M.E. Countries, Islam, Sweden&#39;s Malmo, etc and watch how fast you get banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s interesting is how much bullshit there is in that thread.</p>

<p>The Shah was a supporter of modernization and secularization.  He&#39;s why the women didn&#39;t have to wear hijabs.</p>

<p>And the US didn&#39;t put him into power in the 50&#39;s, the Soviet Union did in 1941 by forcing his father to step down.</p>

<p>The PM in question was a radical aligned with the violent socialist National Front.  One of his major policies was to force landlords to pay 20% of their revenue to their tenants.  He also manipulated a general election to stack parliament, and had them grant him 18 months of &quot;emergency powers&quot; to exercise unlimited authoritarian control, in which time he pushed laws through for even greater land confiscation and redistribution.</p>

<p>He then forced a referendum to dissolve parliament entirely, and manipulated the election process with blatant corruption and threats so that the referendum passed by over 99%.</p>

<p>Around August 16 of that year, 1953, like the Emperor in Star Wars, he suspended the Iranian parliament indefinitely.</p>

<p>The Shah (who had been the Shah for 12 years already) responded by ordering the dismissal of the PM.  This triggered protests and violence, and within 3 days the Iranian people and the military took sides with the Shah and arrested the PM.</p>

<p>That was the &quot;coup&quot;.</p>

<p>The radical socialist PM who had dissolved parliament through vote manipulation was finally fired by the Shah who had been in power for 12 years.</p>

<p>And now socialists say that &quot;the US overthrew the democratic PM and placed the Shah in power, and that&#39;s when democracy and secularism died in Iran!&quot;</p>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights_movement_in_Iran#Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi_era_(1941%E2%80%931979)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights_movement_in_Iran#Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi_era_(1941%E2%80%931979)</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s the real story of women in Iran.  You see any mention of that dictatorial socialist prime minister?</p>

<p>Whole thing&#39;s communist propaganda.</p>

<p>No wonder the <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a> mods love it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more that teachers are hyperconscious of how much propaganda there is in our curriculum so they tend to overcompensate in a futile attempt to make us have perspective.</p>

<p>Then as this go on for a few decades you have people indoctrinated by this unintentional slant which ends up with people pushing cultural Marxism in college.</p>

<p>I think it might start swinging in the other direction though. </p>

<p>School districts now tend to hire younger (and consequently more attractive lol) teachers who aren&#39;t as aware of the sins we committed and don&#39;t pass these down to the children. Many millennials are now more patriotic and politically active because they feel that sentiment is required to stop Trump. Many of gen-Z are increasingly right wing/libertarian (I&#39;d describe the stance as similar to Peter Thiel and that one ex FB exec, basically libertarian capitalists).</p>

<p>This could fuel patriotism for our next conflict, whatever it is. </p>

<p>I&#39;m predicting a space gold rush in the asteroid with monopolies protected by the space projects of the US, China and Russia always trying to violate the monopoly. That would be fucking great lol if I could right I&#39;d do a YA novel about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we&#39;re seeing right now is a large-scale shift in consciousness and our perspective of the world. If you&#39;ve ever played D&amp;D or similar, it&#39;s like the US&#39; generational intelligence is slowly moving from lawful neutral to something like neutral good. Our actions don&#39;t always line up with that, as a nation, but the average person is now much more empathetic to outsiders than they used to be. That changes how we process past, present, and future as a group. </p>

<p>So what used to seem right and natural in history, like the subjugation of less advanced peoples, suddenly strikes our collective culture as abhorrent. People flail around because they <em>very badly</em> do not want to return to a reality where a man can rip your baby apart with dogs and turn into an America folk hero (Columbus, AKA the first importer of bloodhounds to the Americas.) </p>

<p>On top of that, we&#39;re experiencing ecological, financial, and lifestyle stresses that can mostly be traced back to the same long-dead men who were promoting racism, sexism, genocide, etc. Makes it easier to be angry when it&#39;s personal. We also have the web to get around whatever high school textbooks told us. People really are just more &quot;woke&quot; and reacting to uncomfortable realities as they learn about them. </p>

<p>Of course we&#39;re humans, so we don&#39;t know how to do any of this gracefully. Every teenager has to learn the wrongs of the world, lash out at it loudly, and then get over it, but <em>everyone</em> has to do it to mature. There&#39;s always some angry kid ready to lecture you about hijabs or concentration camps in North Korea. You listen and forgive the cringe because it&#39;s a sign they&#39;re growing, not the end result. And that applies to us collectively. There is a lot of deep-down repressed shit in Western culture that needs to get aired out before we can move on from here. This will pass once we no longer need the catharsis from it.</p>

Other CIA-paid men were brought into Tehran in buses and trucks, and took over the streets of the city.</a></p>

<p>I agree that the common narrative isn&#39;t really correct, Mossadegh wasn&#39;t a saint &amp; the Shah wasn&#39;t particularly evil, but your narrative is no better. Keep in mind that the unrest that led to the events on August 16 was caused by literal years of British blockade &amp; CIA intervention. The Shah was better with social issues than people make him out to be, but he was still very much a western puppet &amp; dictator after 1953.</p>

<p>Dissolving was the last part on a long slippery slope, Iran and the Mossadegh government had been in a induced downwards spiral which brought him to this step. Was it the right thing to do? Naw.

<p>the Shah was a supporter of modernization and secularization. He&#39;s why the women in those pictures didn&#39;t have to wear hijabs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Shah doesn&#39;t get credit for that - the women of Iran were emancipated <em>before</em> he seized power. The Shah brought in miniskirts and Coca-cola, but public schools were still segregated under his rule. </p>

<p>But the real issue with the Shah was that his despotic rule led to a backlash. His SAVAK secret police had done a very good job of eliminating all the moderate political opponents, leaving only the mullahs in a position to exploit the power vacuum he created.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the US didn&#39;t put him into power in the 50&#39;s, the Soviet Union did in 1941 by forcing his father to step down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re obviously deeply familiar with the modern history of Iran - so you only discredit yourself by overly precious deflections like this. In 1941, the Shah assumed a largely ceremonial role, akin to Elizabeth II&#39;s constitutional ascension in the UK. In 1953 he assumed complete power as a dictator in a CIA-sponsored coup. Why pretend you don&#39;t know what people are talking about? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Shah (who had been the Shah for 12 years already) finally responded by ordering the dismissal of the PM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mohammad Reza Pahlavi did none of this. It was the CIA&#39;s work, as overseen by Kermit Roosevelt. Roosevelt was the one who came up with the spurious legal arguments via which the Shah deposed the government - a document so bogus they avoided letting even allies look at it. </p>

<p>And this was of course the second attempted coup, right? The CIA&#39;s biggest problem was that the Shah kept running away, because he was afraid of what they were doing in his name. He knew the coup was illegal. What he failed to appreciate was that this didn&#39;t matter. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He did nationalize the Iranian oil industry to block the UK who had helped build it, much like Hugo Chavez did in Venezuela</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mossadegh&#39;s initial goal for the oil industry was <em>not</em> nationalization. He asked BP for a 50/50 revenue split. This was the same deal that ARAMCO had agreed to in Saudi Arabia (after the Saudis <em>had</em> threatened to nationalize). This was the deal that caused Truman-era Americans to be adored in Iran as &quot;fair dealers&quot;. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the British refused to negotiate about anything. They insisted that &quot;one pound more in royalty payments would bankrupt the entire enterprise.&quot; They refused to employ Iranians in any capacity except for untrained labor. Instead of negotiating, they responded to a shutdown with an illegal blockade of Iran. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>The CIA spent about $8M in Iran in the leadup to the coup, bribing anyone they could get their hands on. They bribed mullahs to protest, and bribed police to crack down on the protesters (though it has never been established if they sponsored the slaughter of protesters). When Truman dispatched Averell Harriman to Tehran to assess the situation, the CIA paid protesters to chant &quot;Death to Harriman! Death to the USA!&quot; They destabilized Iran, with the express intent of spreading a fear that the country was going to the Communists. The CIA subverted President Eisenhower, who initially placed 100% of the blame for the chaos in Iran on British refusal to negotiate. CIA head Allen Dulles produced the exact same campaign to force regime change that his grandfather had proven to work in Hawaii, and which Dulles had used to great effect in Cuba in the 1930&#39;s. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And now socialists say that &quot;the US overthrew the democratic PM and placed the Shah in power, and that&#39;s when democracy and secularism died in Iran!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Nobody</em> says that the Shah ended secularism. He ruled as a secular dictator for a couple of decades, during which he outlawed any legitimate opposition. This eventually resulted in what the CIA called &quot;blowback&quot;. When the house of cards they had built in Iran fell, the only ones in a position to take his place were the mullahs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whole thing&#39;s socialist propaganda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even the CIA itself accepts its role in imposing the Shah. It&#39;s not propaganda - it&#39;s history. </p>

<p>He raised the minimum age for marriage to 18 to protect girls.</p>

<p>He gave women the right to divorce.</p>

<p>He banned most polygamy.</p>

<p>What is the point of a vote when it is bestowed by a dictator who is guaranteed 99% of the vote? You might as well also claim that he allowed women to join political parties (and then announced that <em>all</em> Iranian citizens belonged to his party). </p>

<p>But as I recall they were hopeful that the revolution would bring positive change. They viewed the Shah as oppressive. In retrospect I think they were much like the American kids who call Trump Hitler and talk about people being fascists. They may be pointing out real injustice or things that should be corrected, but they have no idea of scale or what real oppression can look like. </p>

<p>I think the same thing happened in Cuba. Castro denied being a communist and I&#39;m sure some of the people there believed him and thought they would see a positive change from Batista. </p>

<p>You know, like all the &quot;little nudges&quot; that the CIA used in Chile in 1973, installing <em>yet another</em> brutal dictator in place of a democratically elected Marxist (one who explicitly refused to go the typical Marxist route of armed revolution, he went the parliamentary route and look where it got him, American flags up his asshole). Which <strong><em>coincidentally</em></strong> protected the profits of American owned ITT Corporation. Just like AJAX <strong><em>coincidentally</em></strong> protected British Petroleum from being nationalized. </p>

<p>Just like all the &quot;little nudges&quot; in Guatemala in 1954, where we gave military support for <strong><em>yet another dictatorship</em></strong> in order to pretty transparently protect the profits of <strong><em>yet another American corporation</em></strong>- the United Fruit Company, who was threatened by land reforms...</p>

<p>But yeah no you guys listen to <a href="/u/JBlitzen">/u/JBlitzen</a> you guys, it was all about stopping the big bad socialists and the <strong><em>incredibly obvious profit motive</em></strong> behind it was all juuuuuust a coincidence.

    <div class="md"><p>What really gets me is this:</p>

<p>We get shills flooding in here, right? Corporate, government, secret societies if that&#39;s your big concern, shills of all kinds. And why wouldn&#39;t groups with a vested interest in how peoples&#39; opinions take form attempt to have a hand in their formation? Why wouldn&#39;t they pump money into astroturfing? It&#39;s low cost, high reward mass manipulation that the democratic, decentralized nature of the internet <em>necessitates</em> in order to maintain the control over the flow of information central ownership of traditional media formerly allowed. </p>

<p>But how can you stop it? The only real way is, as your post implies, to ban narratives like those and those who push them. In effect, we must define our own wrongthink and punish accordingly, because the nature of astroturfing means that we can no longer judge what is agreed upon by the appearance of a consensus and discussion. I&#39;m not saying that I support this course of action, but it is the most immediate and logical course of action to be undertook by those who perceive themselves to be attacked by an outside group or force attempting to manipulate a community&#39;s opinions against them. The alternative is to simply fight the narratives with argument, which is a losing battle when one is paid and has organized support and the other is organic. It&#39;s digital asymmetric warfare. </p>

<p>So here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> we are witnessing the same sorts of pressures, the same sorts of phenomenon that in my opinion were a great driving force for the trend towards authoritarianism in Marxist countries. And, strangely, even right-wing, anti-Marxist posters seem to react in the same manner as these left-authoritarians, supporting the idea of banning the ______ (Pedos/X-Gate denialists/etc). So it&#39;s not like they can&#39;t understand that sort of sentiment, right?</p>

<p>But nobody here seems to put two and two together. Nobody compares the astroturfing money dumped into the internet with, for example, the hundreds of millions of dollars the CIA dumped into Chile&#39;s <em>El Mercurio</em> to run anti-Allende &quot;news.&quot; Or the funding of right-wing, anti-socialist guerillas, or similar actions in other socialist regimes i.e. Nicaragua (Iran-Contra). Nobody sees the similarity in how those regimes reacted with how some people wish the mods would react here.</p>

<p>And because of that, the guy above just has to say &quot;The evil socialists wanted to dissolve parliament!&quot; and people already primed to react against socialism nod to each other in agreement. They don&#39;t think &quot;Well, is it perhaps the case that the parliament was bought and paid for by the British, and were part of the same colonializing forces the CIA/MI5 were brought in to assist?&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to defend authoritarianism, per se, but I&#39;m trying to point out that the actions of the CIA et al have placed innumerable people in an impossible position. How do you protect free speech and the noble ideals of democracy when a hostile force exerts overwhelming influence to manipulate your system against you? I haven&#39;t been able to figure out a solution to that problem, which is why it&#39;s hard for me to blame- as an example- the Sandinistas when they suspended habeus corpus and the right to free assembly. The best solution I&#39;ve been able to figure out has been to structure society in as decentralized and democratically a manner as possible, to disperse the tools necessary for authoritarian control, and to involve as many people in the political process as possible. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been posting about anarcho-syndicalism and parpolity. </p>

<p>Aye. Will have to google parpolity (I assume it is an equivalent to parecon?), but in principle, that is where the solution lies, IMO also.

<p>Yeah, it was intended to pair with parecon, I didn&#39;t bring up the latter because I&#39;m not very familiar with parecon. I should probably learn more about it, I&#39;ve just been trying to spread the word on anarcho-syndicalism (by which I mean basically I&#39;m trying to inform others that it&#39;s a thing at all- look at <a href="/u/ConcernedCanook">/u/ConcernedCanook</a> below, comments like his are something I see 1000 times a day even though stateless forms of socialism exist... I digress) because it seems to me an appropriate decentralized form of socialism to avoid the trend to authoritarianism we&#39;ve witnessed elsewhere, while simultaneously providing enough of a unified power structure to potentially affect political change through the current democratic system (assuming the bourgeoisie allowed a vote that strips them of their power...) via the trade unions. </p>

<p>But maybe organization via trade unions isn&#39;t necessary if parecon provides an alternative path to change. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you support systems of government control like Socialism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Socialism isn&#39;t &quot;a system of government control.&quot; Socialism refers to a wide range of economic and political ideologies, <strong><em>some of which</em></strong> could be characterized as you did, i.e. Marxism-Leninism/Stalinism/Maoism. Those socialist ideologies seek to implement social ownership of the means of production under a centralized state bureaucracy. </p>

<p>There are <strong><em>other</em></strong> socialist ideologies which <strong><em>don&#39;t do that</em></strong>. And, in fact, many of these ideologies were thought up explicitly to serve as an alternative to this Marxist-Leninist mode of ownership.</p>

<p>As an example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a> is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">libertarian socialism</a> characterized by the direct ownership of the means of production by the workers themselves, or via their trade unions, organized democratically into syndicates of workplaces under an overall federation. There is no elite political class of bureaucrats. There is no elite economic class of owners. An example of this in practice was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia">Revolutionary Catalonia</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m 100% expecting you to either not read this at all, or read this and not understand it and still persist with some stupid ass-backwards argument about how I&#39;m really wrong and socialism = government control even though I&#39;ve literally just illustrated that that isn&#39;t the case. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just gonna disable inbox replies btw because I have 0 interest in <em>yet another</em> such argument. Hopefully I&#39;m wrong and you&#39;re one of the rare anti-socialist reactionaries who can actually read and learn. </p>

<p>We get that all the time. Someone dissolving Congress? That’d be different.</p>

<p>Dissolving was the last part on a long slippery slope, Iran and the Mossadegh government had been in a induced downwards spiral which brought him to this step. Was it the right thing to do? Naw. Would it have happend (and would the religious front have overpowered first the socialists and then the conservatives) without british and US meddling? probably not. </p>

<p>The US has never seen &quot;nudges&quot; form a foreign power to that extend..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have a monarchy with a sovereign as head of state, dissolving parliament is often a built-in part of the system.  Parliaments are dissolved after a no-confidence vote as well.</p>

<p>Usually a sovereign dissolving parliament is a very formalized ritual and not undertaken outside of the ritual process, but on paper the sovereign often retains the right to dissolve parliament for a bunch of reasons which can be highly ambiguous.</p>

<p>The US congress is a co-equal branch of government which cannot be dissolved by the head of state, the President, whose branch is co-equal, nor by the Supreme Court. </p>

<p>The best solution I&#39;ve been able to figure out has been to structure society in as decentralized and democratically a manner as possible, to disperse the tools necessary for authoritarian control, and to involve as many people in the political process as possible. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been posting about anarcho-syndicalism and parpolity. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aye. Will have to google parpolity (I assume it is an equivalent to parecon?), but in principle, that is where the solution lies, IMO also. Everyone his own king, bank and military; all else must and will fail in the long run. True democracy is anarchic. Someone coined the word &quot;demarchy&quot;, and I really like it and the philsophy behind it. </p>
