        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>And the System is censoring Aaron Swartz in real time. Googling his name would get one video and only by misspelling his name would also get the other documentary with 2 million views</strong></p>

<p><strong>But that was a few hours ago and now none of the vidoes show up.</strong></p>

<p>In case you have no idea who he is and his relation to reddit, He merged his Infogami (both nascent YC projects) six months after Steve &amp; Alexis founded reddit in 2005</p>

<p>After hacking MIT to release educational information he was charged by the government for a maximum of 50 years in federal prison and $1 million in fines</p>

<p>It just occurred to me that they wanted him to take the guilty plea so that the media would make it look like it&#39;s actually immoral to share educational information outside of their indoctrination</p>

<p>Never forget the insidiousness of the System my friends</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a documentary for those interested</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpvcc9C8SbM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpvcc9C8SbM</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>OH and guess what. Google is censoring this documentary. It only shows up if you misspell his name</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what I was going to say when I was originally making this post. I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s algorithms or if Google is stalking me. The 2 mill video shows up seventh in videos after some nonsense. Well actually the nonsense is pretty par for the course for this subreddit sometimes lmao and it could be true for god&#39;s sake</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no doubt that EMF and RF radiation can adversely affect the body. In thousands of peer-reviewed scientific studies, researchers have shown that every-day levels of exposure result in adverse biological effects such as genetic damage, changes to important hormones and neurotransmitters, the stress response in cells, sperm damage, changes in brain wave patterns and sometimes breaches of the blood-brain-barrier. Some changes are consistent with cancer.</p>

<p>Governments and EMF-emitting industries generally maintain that these changes are not important for health and that only the heating effects of radiation cause health problems. However, many scientists disagree and believe that the long-term consequences of these sorts of changes could cause problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His crime was aiming to right the real crime that&#39;s ongoing. A huge proportion, I suspect the vast majority, of paywalled academic studies were publicly funded via government grants. Taxpayers pay for the research, researchers submit their work for free (or even for a fee paid to the publisher, if they want their work printed with colour figures, etc.), publishers profit from all that public funding and free (for them) expert labour, and the information remains accessible only to those who pay these for-profit companies or belong to an institution that does. It&#39;s sick. </p>

<p>(IMO, public research funding should be increased at <em>least</em> enough to allow all publicly funded research to be printed in open access journals, because anything else is theft of information from the public to pad the pockets of publishers.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right wing trolls tend to get blocked more because the right wing operates more on lies.</p>

<p>To give a couple of right-wing lies just within the last month:</p>

<p>The right wing made a big fuss about Melania putting up the nativity scene at the white house, claiming it&#39;s the first time it&#39;s been there in 8 years.  The truth is that it&#39;s been there every year, even while Obama was president.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve also been claiming recently that we could now say &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; again, as if we hadn&#39;t been allowed to.  Yet there was no law on the books banning those words, nobody has ever admitted there was was someone holding a gun to their heads keeping them from saying it, and Obama himself even said it.</p>

<p>And these are just the minor lies.  The right wing has enveloped itself in it&#39;s narrative so much that they can&#39;t even tell what the truth is anymore.  And they think that they need to educate others with these lies, hence why right wing trolls get blocked from sources like Wikipedia.  Funny....despite how much the right wing complains about &quot;rights&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot;....they really hate it when people have access to truthful information.</p>

<p>all I suggest is you look around closely, you put 2 and 2 together you will get 5</p>

<p>So if you look too closely, you end up with conclusions that don&#39;t reflect reality.  Right.. that&#39;s the problem, lol.</p>

<p>I think he refused and they watched him and put bogus charges on him to force compliance. Instead, he resisted and ultimately killed himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting this! Thanks for SAYING this! I cant to this day NOT TEAR UP just hearing his name because THIS SHOWS WHAT OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS TODAY. We eat or kill our young and our creative visionaries. The biggest sign of human decline. Im reading this on New Years day. Im embarking on a new mission to find a way to better educate and nurture discovery and SHARE IT OPENLY. Im a 65 yr old aspie who didnt know it&amp;  who was so inspired and made hopeful by Aaron&#39;s taking on the rotten self serving interests of academia in such an open , elegant way. I hope the evil pathetic DoJ career obsessed cunt of a federal prosecutor who literally threatened him to death is haunted to death for her deeds. Ill wager however, shes still out wreaking havoc and hunting for trophies to further her own federally funded career. Perhaps I should pray nfor those like her who seem to have no inkling or use for harboring a soul or who have made the deadly mistake of pretending that federal LAW has any positive relation to JUSTICE today. Aarons soul was manifested and lives on! And seeing this post and the comments here is reason enough to rejoice and not despair or succumb to it.WHAT A BEAUTIFUL POST TO FIND HERE ON NEW YEARS DAY RIPAaron. We who dream of better things will never forget you, even though we miss you. I for one will carry on shining the light in your name and spirit. Namaste, with an open mind, open SOURCE, open heart, open pollinators, and an open carry.  </p>

<p>Yes, research needs to be free to access. Paywalls fucking suck. </p>

<p>No, his weak ass isn&#39;t a martyr. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Xalli be prepared for the inevitable flak of system generated troll ballers. Yes. Your suspicion is on target. They have already infected the interwebz with their bots. More bots than humans interacting throughout it these days. S&#39;okay. We persist and will prevail. With diligence and intent. Be aware that if you are human and continue to act in the interests of altruism and self preservation, and  NOT in the interests of maintaining status quo for the system , above yourself, then you are already identified and targeted by their bots. Bots dont die, they degrade. The humies that program them however, still bleed, suffer and die.  So farthe laws of nature still prevail. Stay safe and aware freind. </p>
