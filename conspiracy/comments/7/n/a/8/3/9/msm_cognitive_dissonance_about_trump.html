        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Not a &quot;Trump supporter&quot; in any sense of the word nor does this have anything to do about Hillary so if you respond with anything about me supporting Trump or a weak strawman deflection about Hillary, Fox News, or anything else you have successfully pointed out to everyone that either you did not read this post or you do not have the critical thinking skills to analyze and respond coherently.</p>

<p>That said there seems to be a clear Cognitive Dissonance about Trump by much of the media. To be clear I am not arguing anything about the validity of these claims just repeating what I have seen popular opinion become from &quot;credible&quot; news sources and what many people actually believe. </p>

<p>One the one hand there is this narrative that &quot;Trump is a orange bafoon and doesn&#39;t have the iq to be in office&quot;, yet on the other hand you have the narrative that, &quot;Trump is this corrupt mastermind who not only managed to secretly collude with Russia and WikiLeaks to cheat his way to the election just to get him and his friends more rich, but also was able to convince millions of people he was there savior.&quot; </p>

<p>How can you reconcile these seemingly conflicting views. I have heard people say that &quot;Putin is using Trump&quot; but that makes even less sense especially now with the Ukraine and Iran situation going on both against Russia unless you are willing to believe that Trump is &quot;trying not to make it obvious&quot; which again goes against the narrative that he is an orange buffoon and actually ironically enough goes along with t_ds &quot;4d chess&quot;.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with this cognitive dissonance is the fact that many users come on to this sub claiming that we are &quot;crazy Trump supporters following only right wing theories&quot; yet ironically enough what they believe is an arguably even more insane conspiracy theory which they believe not because of evidence to support it but because of both who it comes from and because it validates there &quot;team&quot;.</p>

<p>The irony is outrageous.</p>

<p>I agree but the two I stated I consider to be &quot;popular opinion&quot; if you don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair feel free to correct me.</p>

<p>Your proving my point. You may not even realize it but your mind just went through some serious mental gymnastics to fit your worldview to the conflicting viewpoints without even considering actual evidence.</p>

<p>So what your saying is he actually isn&#39;t a bafoon, but that is a &quot;act&quot;? Doesn&#39;t that actually support the whole &quot;4d chess&quot; idea and that he is actually a genius? I don&#39;t understand what you are saying here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I generally don’t see the idea that Trump masterminded any part of the Russian collusion narrative.

<p>What do you think the pisstape is real? Explain.</p>

<p>The best part about this theory is that anything that Trump does that remotely supports Russia is immediately used as evidence and literally everything else is convienently ignored just like Ukraine and Iran.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe. I doubt something like that would have been sufficiently motivating, though. It just isn’t that bad except from an optics perspective.</p>

<p>I’d bet Trump is more financially troubled than he lets on, and access to Russian banks is the real motivator. We already know many international banks refuse to give him loans, due to his particular style of not paying people back. Between that and his bankruptcy he doesn’t have much fiscal credit.</p>

<p>What about Ukraine and Iran, specifically?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you imputed &quot;mental gymnastics&quot; on my point because it didn&#39;t mesh with your own worldview. I didn&#39;t say I KNEW anything. The statement was &quot;assuming there...&quot; (meaning I acknowledge there may not have been) and what followed was a theory based on that scenario. I fully admit I don&#39;t have a full grasp on the evidence for collusion but I have plenty of evidence that Trump is an arse-clown. </p>

<p>1) He and the GOP <em>loudly</em> complained about President Obama every time he played golf -- like he went on Fox &amp; Friends a dozen times in the 2010s to bitch about Obama golfing -- and he literally made it a campaign pledge that he <em>wouldn&#39;t have time for golf like that lazy Obama</em>, before turning right around and golfing more than any president in history;</p>

<p>2) Every time he plays golf he sends his aides out to claim that he&#39;s not golfing, and we shouldn&#39;t tolerate straight factual lies from the White House and should call them out -- if he didn&#39;t lie it wouldn&#39;t matter but because he lies it&#39;s the press&#39;s duty to disprove the lie.</p>

<p>Oh so on top of inheriting an economic crisis he isn&#39;t allowed to golf because of it?And then because its at his private club, we are paying one of his private businesses for him to golf there. Our tax dollars are literally going into renting his golf carts from his club. Not to mention using the coast guard to secure the shoreline of a building that was never meant to be used this way.</p>

<p>It&#39;s illegal for Trump to not take a salary and that is paid for by the taxpayer.  He is on the taxpayer&#39;s dime.</p>

<p>Obama golfed significantly less often than Trump.  The taxpayer does not cover entry fees to golf courses for president&#39;s leisure so Trump doesn&#39;t save the taxpayer a dime by going to his own courses but he does get to bilk the taxpayer for rental fees of golf carts and other facilities to his taxpayer funded security detail.  Not only does his golfing not cost less, the taxpayer is paying money to Trump&#39;s business for the privilege of having him play while lying to us that he&#39;s at work.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Putin was rooting for Trump never made any sense for one profound reason: The Soviet Union was brought down by collapsing the price of oil. Reagan negotiated a deal with OPEC to artificially depress the spot-price of crude oil, and the USSR--being overly reliant on this commodity--was destabilized and collapsed.</p>

<p>I was watching a Russian analyst talk about it. He said that the &quot;arms race&quot; tactic of collapsing the USSR was a myth. It wasn&#39;t weapons that made them implode; it was the collapse of oil prices.</p>

<p>Right now, Putin (who lived through the Soviet collapse) is fighting to stop fracking because it&#39;s destroying the price of oil. </p>

<p>There was an article about how all the anti-fracking propaganda in the US was coming from Putin-funded front companies.</p>

<p>So Putin would never, ever, <em>ever</em> be for the pro-fracking candidate [Donald Trump].</p>

<p>He would tactically <em>have</em> to be for there anti-fracking candidate [Hillary Clinton].</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but haven&#39;t you seen those two sketches of the Podesta brothers in Panama??? Think about it: the two sketches were of one person, so it can&#39;t have been both John and Tony in Panama. . . . UNLESS you ask yourself this: have you ever seen them in public together? Not a picture, but in real life, because pictures can be faked. Now do you see where I&#39;m going: Tony and John are one person, one super pedo. This solves all kinds of problems. It means that the pictures of two people were actually pictures of the Tony/John super-pedo in different forms. And it means that it actually is John that owns all of the pedo art, so people who have been claiming that are vindicated. And it means that it is John who operates the Podesta Group, so all of the people who have been claiming that are vindicated as well.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You missed the point. Probably intentionally. At least do two seconds of research before humiliating yourself. </p>

<p>&quot;The fact that Kremlin opposition to European fracking has nothing to do with environmental concerns should be clear even to the dullest among us, because Russia has massive fracking projects of its own underway in Siberia. The real goal is to keep Europe dependent upon Russia for its fuel supply. Natural-gas prices in Europe are quadruple those prevailing in the United States, and by maintaining a near-monopoly on overpriced European natural-gas imports, the Putin regime assures itself of a vast source of revenue. This allows it to rule and rearm Russia without permitting the freedom necessary to develop the country’s human potential. Furthermore, so long as Europe is kept critically dependent upon Russia for fuel, Moscow can paralyze and render ineffective any Western response to its plans for conquest, whose initial steps are currently being demonstrated in Ukraine. More, and much worse, is certain to follow so long as Europe remains helpless.</p>

<p>The Kremlin’s all-out effort to stop fracking in Western nations is not limited to openly broadcasting lies, hysteria, and propaganda through its official media organizations. It also engages in covert operations, behind-the-scenes lobbying and payoffs, and political manipulations using its agents of influence. Many of these are documented by former U.S. ambassador to Lithuania Keith C. Smith in a recent paper published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>

<p>The link I posted explained why Putin is anti fracking. His whole plan of dominance depends on it. I&#39;d say it&#39;s one of the single most important issues to him. Hence why he would never want a pro fracking president. And the link also explains the lengths he goes to with disinfirmation, propaganda, and even bribery to prevent fracking from gaining any kind of support. That&#39;s hardly pro Putin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is Forbes &quot;alt right?&quot; How about the NATO Secretary General? Is he alt right too? 
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently announced that the Russian intelligence service was covertly funding European environmental NGOs to support their campaign against fracking. The former Danish Prime Minister stated that he had “met allies who can report that Russia, as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations, engaged actively with so-called non-governmental organizations – environmental organizations working against shale gas – to maintain European dependence on imported Russian gas.”</p>

<p>The accusations do not seem too far-fetched. Russia is very keen on dissuading Europe from exploiting its shale reserves. Disregardful of their own massive fracking projects in Siberia, Vladimir Putin uses environmental arguments to push an EU-wide fracking ban. In a similar fashion, he tries to discourage the US from exporting of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to Europe.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bjornlomborg/2014/06/23/fracking-could-free-europe-from-putins-gas-monopoly/#1c27043959cc">https://www.forbes.com/sites/bjornlomborg/2014/06/23/fracking-could-free-europe-from-putins-gas-monopoly/#1c27043959cc</a></p>

<p>How about foreign policy.com? They &quot;alt right&quot; too?</p>

<p>Russia trying to maintain its energy stranglehold over Europe by backing movements across the continent to demonize fracking, the head of NATO alleged. It is part of Russia’s broader use of soft power and covert means to complement its more overt efforts to reassert influence in Europe and keep countries there from developing alternatives to an energy addiction worth $100 million a day to Moscow.</p>

<p>&quot;I have met allies who can report that Russia, as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations, engage actively with so-called non-government organizations — environmental organizations working against shale gas — obviously to maintain European dependence on imported Russian gas,&quot; NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said after a Chatham House speech this week.&quot;

<p>One the one hand there is this narrative that &quot;Trump is a orange bafoon and doesn&#39;t have the iq to be in office&quot;, yet on the other hand you have the narrative that, &quot;Trump is this corrupt mastermind who not only managed to secretly collude with Russia and WikiLeaks to cheat his way to the election just to get him and his friends more rich, but also was able to convince millions of people he was there savior.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard Trump critics accuse him of being a mastermind. Many legitimately are speculating on whether or not he has early stage dementia. All that &quot;15D Chess&quot; stuff comes from Trump supporters. </p>

<p>As far as convincing people. That&#39;s because Trump is a symptom, not the disease. He ran with a healthcare plan that was &quot;something great&quot; and a &quot;secret plan to defeat ISIS in 30 days.&quot; He also was just outed for running a fake school to rob people of their savings. If that&#39;s a bandwagon people wanted to get on, that&#39;s on them.</p>

If Trump is seen as dangerous due to his diagnosis of narcissism and a lot else, and people in the profession didn&#39;t speak out and suddenly he gets information that nk is about to launch a missile so he starts nuclear warfare because he thinks hes an expert in everything..the info he got was wrong but too late, men and women and children die, radiation spreads and so on and so on.
Those who knew he was unstable and not intelligence would have blood on their hands.  I&#39;d much rather have them analyze and warn us. Trump would get help and other trustworthy people would deal with nk.</p>

Look at how we catch serial killers. The body and surrounding evidence is examined. A profile of the killer is written up based on data banks of killers and their behavior. The FBI never met their subject. They catch him/her on the basis of information and the advantage of technology and skills of the profiler and team. They stop the subject from killing again.
Trump isn&#39;t a serial killer but he is in a position of killing millions. He sees it as a big thing, power. Look at me what I can do. He&#39;s a powder keg. Political party doesn&#39;t matter in this case. All human beings can die in a war.

    <div class="md"><p>Hm I think you’re misunderstanding what they’re saying. Trump isn’t a very smart individual. I think that’s pretty much mutually agreed upon by everyone besides his 30%. </p>

<p>Trump and the people he surrounded himself with tried to use Russia to aid his election chances very sloppily . He wasn’t the one who ordered Russia to hack the dnc nor did Russia care if he won or not. They were trying to cause chaos in America and weaken our democracy and ended up getting the perfect president for that which was just icing on the cake for them. </p>

<p>The reason the investigation into trump is even happening is he’s not a smart guy and doesn’t understand what is against the rules. At this point we know he knew about the Russian hack before Wikileaks’s leaked anything. All he had to do was stay away from the situation but he couldn’t because he thinks he’s above the law and smarter then everyone else and now he’s under investigation for conspiracy with a foreign nation to undermine an election.</p>

<p>I honestly don’t even think he wanted to win. It’s way more work to be President then he wants to do. I’d guess he wanted to use the election to boost his brand and then use that to open Trump media/tv and make a killing off of his 30%. Now his brands are losing money and credibility. His name is being dragged through the mud everyday and he might be impeached on basically charges of treason because he surrounded himself with idiots that wouldn’t stand up to him. </p>

<p>I do think the media coverage of his every move is getting silly. Just like I thought Fox News was with Obama.  Obama can wear a tan suit and Donald can eat all the McDonald’s he wants. Not sure how any of that’s news. But I guess it gets viewers and that’s all that matters to some. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here, let&#39;s unify the narrative:  Trump is an orange buffoon that allowed himself to be compromised by Russian interests long, long ago because it made him wealthy to do so.  His election was the result a well orchestrated campaign that divided and conquered the electorate through divisive issues and bombastic rhetoric that constantly dominated the news.</p>

<p>We have clear evidence Trump&#39;s campaign was meeting with Russia prior to the election.  We have evidence Trump wanted to develop property in Russia prior to running.  We have evidence Trump has had multiple Russian investors in projects for over 20 years.  We have direct evidence from Trump&#39;s son that they met with Russians to collude on the release of damaging information about Hillary Clinton in an effort to win the election and the evidence he posted on Twitter.</p>

<p>The cognitive dissonance is knowing all these facts, on top of knowing his litigious behavior, his narcissism, his pride, his own admission on tape of sexually harassing women, his 19,000+ lawsuits, his settlements for millions out of court to settle lawsuits of fraud, his stiffing of vendors, his verbal abuse of his subordinates and his authoritarian tendencies and still elected him President and think he cares about anyone other than himself.</p>

<p>This guy makes more off the US government vacationing at his own properties than he gets in salary.  He&#39;s managed to monetize campaigning and being President.  He&#39;s as corrupt as the day is long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On a similar note, was drives me up the wall is that there is so much truthful things you could say about Trump that make him look really bad, and yet the mainstream media still insists on spreading lies about him. I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s an intentional technique to confuse and divide people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re describing is postmodern neo-marxism.  It&#39;s about the destruction of any and all standards, and anything that doesn&#39;t represent the whole and the individual at the same time, which is why it ends up always being a self-destructive illogical but highly emotional mess.   And it goes beyond Trump, into all the other SJW areas.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair it&#39;s been the same way for the last two Presidents. The Tea Party argued that Obama was a buffoon who embarrassed America daily and was elected because of his race rather than merit, while simultaneously claiming that he made calculated decisions to push a NWO, anti-American agenda. Bush was apparently the dumbest man to ever be elected to any government position, yet helped engineer the greatest terrorist attack/government coverup in history. </p>

<p>Have you ever taken a journalism class? News is never &quot;just news&quot;. Any secondary source has its own spin of the truth. </p>

<p>Much of the nature of reality has been programmed to &quot;seem absurd&quot; to most people.</p>
