    <div class="md"><p>If there were nothing going on in their own country, then they would have no data of their own to verify it.</p>

<p>If it were a conspiracy, and if it included multiple countries, then at least some of the leaders in those countries would have to be part of it. Given that they all conspire to cover up WTC 7, doesn&#39;t that seem possible, and if that is possible, then wouldn&#39;t a human conspiracy be a more likely explanation than an alien invasion?</p>

<p>Lol The exact same footage? Over an over? </p>

<p>That would prove the opposite. That would tell me it was pre rendered footage.</p>

<p>Like the Vegas shootings. It was the same couple clips over and over. There should be a zillion different clips... Its in Vegas. Casinos like to see what people are doing.</p>

<p>Anyways I digress.</p>

<p>Youll probably never get me to believe in aliens. </p>

<p>Just because an elitist lackey goes on TV and interviews an &quot;invading alien&quot; and a high tech laser on an advnaced drone blows up a building does not mean I will bow to the whim of some cook in an monster suit with big guns.</p>

<p>I am thoroughly convinced that the common ideological portrayal of &quot;space&quot; aliens causing mass hysteria or some other world wide crisis has been injected in to our minds in order to sell the lie of a world wide take over of a fake alien race, or in reality, the usurping of free humanity by the new world order.</p>
