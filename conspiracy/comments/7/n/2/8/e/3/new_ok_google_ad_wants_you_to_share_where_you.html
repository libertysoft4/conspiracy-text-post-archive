        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Im bad with reddit so forgive me for not posting a link to said commercial. </p>

<p>I was watching a YouTube video and they have the five second ads beforehand and this one was from google. It was for its new smart home device where you can interact with it using your voice. The specific example chosen is what bothered me as it seems to be straight out of 1984. It was “Hey Google, please remember that i hid my passport in the top right corner of my sock drawer”.  It replies, “ okay, i will remember where you put your passport.”</p>

<p>The whole concept and sale point was “ oh geez im an idiot i should tell ‘Google’ where i hide my most personal documents because im such a forgetful person. Thanks google for fixing this issue forever.”</p>

<p>Google is the last thing i want to know where i keep my valuables and passport. This commercial was a wake up call and should be for all of us. No company should know where we keep our passports. Its 24-7 listening will also do that even if you don’t directly say it to it. </p>

<p>Thoughts, reddit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah, best idea is to not reveal to google where your valuables are but this was the example used in the commercial for why its a great product. They couldn’t figure out s better example than where one of our most valuable documents is kept? It just seems shady to me, and how blatant the invasion of privacy is. It was like, “this is so obvious you shouldn’t critically think about what we are asking you to do”.  </p>

<p>Pretty messed up if you ask me. Just thought i would bring it to peoples attention. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You absolutely did not dream it. Dead zone bags llc was one company, maybe faraday wallets was another different company but dead zone bags recently closed their doors and legally constrained from revealing why. They couldnt even offer repairs or replacements or warranties from existing purchases. However, the clever bastards posted their links to all the materials and instructions to make your own. It was on their website which may be down entirely now. </p>

<p>But yeah, faraday bags for wallets, laptops, etc are now illegal to sell, repair, or manufacture, so it seems. They weren’t allowed to say why. </p>

<p>If you dont know how just wrap your electronics in aluminum foil and plastic, and repeat. The deadzone bags used really fine stainless steel mesh and non cutting nylon fabric. Meshes work fine by the way. Just use fine mesh and conductive material which metals are. </p>

<p>Shady shit goin on i tell ya hwat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never heard of them before. Interesting product. That certainly does prove it is not illegal to sell or manufacture so i wonder why deadzones bags are gone and legally cant say why. Thanks for the info. </p>

<p>Dead zone bags did block literally everything and i havent searched to see if these also do the same or just rfid frequencies. </p>
