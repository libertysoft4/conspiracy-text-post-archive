        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It probably won’t be popular here, but those of you who are <em>read in</em> to the occult might understand what I’m getting at. </p>

<p>I think that part of our evolution, the next step, is veganism. Hear me out. </p>

<p>Before you say, “vegetables and plants are alive too” know that that is understood. They don’t have flesh and blood though. I think that is a step towards our ascension into the better version of humanity. </p>

<p>One theory in Alchemy actually suggests that man was originally part of the vegetable kingdom, which makes sense if you consider evolution; microbial life gave way to plant life which gave way to animal life which gave way to man; so on and so forth. </p>

<p>Isn’t it strange how dogs behave? What they must think of us, these odd two legged creatures who take care of them and ask for nothing but their presence in return. I think that is “of god” </p>

<p>What do pigs and cows think of us? We must seem like the most cruel of betrayers to them. </p>

<p>I have read much occult material, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages” by Manly P. Hall comes to mind. The goal apparently, is to eventually nourish ourselves with only our breath and the sun’s radiance. Monks in the east have achieved this, though fierce dedication. </p>

<p>I think that rejecting consuming flesh of any kind is the fastest way for an individual to become enlightened. It’s also of course healthier, to a degree. </p>

<p>If anything, I think we should care for the animals, they are our closest relatives on Mother Earth. They deserve our protection. An animal can’t decide to show love or hate. An animal just does what animals do. I believe humanity is behaving like animals. </p>

<p>The goal is to not cause any suffering. Perhaps switching to a vegan diet can be a big step towards that. </p>

<p>Just a theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don’t evolution and science describe God’s plan? </p>

<p>If God meant for the universe and life to be so complex, which we have to assume he did given how complex life and the universe are, what would someone assume that these aren’t God’s “building blocks” or designs? That seems almost arrogant to me personally. Put it this way: What makes you think you have the ability to understand or fathom on the same level as GOD?</p>

<p>Not trying to argue per se, I’m more curious as to why the belief in science AND God seem to be at odds for you (and others).</p>

<p>I tried again last year. I only lasted about four months, but I realied it’s the path for me. I’ve just been being lazy, it sort of took a backseat. I had an epiphany yesterday, that I was completely rejecting what I knew what was best for me. So I’m giving it another go. </p>

<p>Factory farming causes suffering all by itself. The amount of pesticides used for one. Also the loss of animal life that comes from the huge Combines that harvest vegetables. Many deer fawns, rabbits ground nesting birds etc. </p>

<p>To curb that suffering people would have to grow their own food.  Unfortunately not to many people would ever be on board with that at this stage of the human experience. So many like to be fat, dumb and entertained. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that so? Well, have you ever witnessed kosher or halaal slaughter? If not, you should retract your uninformed opinion.</p>

<p>The only reason they use the terribly slow and horrific method of throat-slitting is because according to their man-made guidelines (scripture) the soul of the beast is confined to the blood. And with this impeccable logic they conclude that eating blood pie makes you a beast. So much for wisdom and mercy. Look at some halaal/kosher videos and come right back here.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The only way we win this battle, and by we I mean humanity, is if we kill or suppress a whole lot of stupid people. I’m not going to play judge, jury, and executioner but part of me certainly wished someone would.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, it doesn’t really matter. I like this OP better. I’ve been looking for a compelling spiritual argument for veganism.</p>

<p>For the time being, I can’t help but seeing the traditional farm - whereby domesticated animals defecate and in turn feed the soil/plants, in which there is no gratuitous suffering - as being quite natural/righteous.</p>

<p>Also, veganism seems like a very luxurious lifestyle. Traditionally humans (who can’t afford eating food shipped from the other side of the world) have relied on animals for proteins, especially in winter time.</p>

<p>If one becomes sensitive to universal energy you can actual feel the removal of energy from yourself if you kill another living thing. </p>
