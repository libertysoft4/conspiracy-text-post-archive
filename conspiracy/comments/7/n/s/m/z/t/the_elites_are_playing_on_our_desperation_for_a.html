<p>They have effectively generated this cult-like following with him, and gave him good PR with conspiracy theorists. As a matter of fact, nearly all of the leading alternative media figures (Alex Jones, PJW) seemed to have flipped in unison in support of not only Trump as an &quot;outsider&quot;, but conservative and republican ideals as a whole.</p>

<p>This seems like a large scale psy op, pre-planned to &quot;merge&quot; conspiracy theorist culture with extreme conservative and pro-Trump/anti democrat values. </p>

<p><strong>This is to destroy the non partisan appeal that the conspiracy community has, which often draws in new lurkers and users.</strong></p>

<p>My insights and observations of the current administration have led me to this conclusion, and unfortunately it seems as if some parts of the truth movement have fallen prey to this dirty scripted trick.  </p>

<p>This is one of the most intellectually dishonest claims I&#39;ve seen Trump apologists make.  Don&#39;t believe your own eyes or thoughts, he&#39;s actually on our side but needs to make everyone else believe he&#39;s not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I wasn&#39;t accusing you of being a Trump supporter, I&#39;m just saying this is a claim I&#39;ve seen, mostly from Trump supporters, who are willing to look past blatant deviations from his campaign promises, and things they would normally criticize with any other president, and suggest that things aren&#39;t how they seem. That there&#39;s a secret hidden agenda that defies logic and common sense, and Trump is actually fooling everyone else but &quot;us&quot;, and he&#39;s actually on our side in a secret 007 kind of way.</p>

<p>4D chess indicates to me that we shouldn&#39;t believe our own eyes and have blind faith in Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re probably right, but I think it’s more complicated than that. </p>

<p>First (I’m sure I’ll gsf flak for this) you’re operating under the assumption that <em>all secret societies are bad</em> or <em>everything the NWO does is bad</em> but I don’t necessarily think that’s the case. </p>

<p>I think their are different factions and I think we are witnessing a civil war within the elite, else Saudi Billionaires wouldn’t be getting arrested and Canadian CEOs wouldn’t be getting iced at home. </p>

<p>The Zionist’s are bad news, and that’s who I think Trump works for, but we honestly can’t be sure. He’s acting like a real dictator, albeit a fat, stupid one. He’s not listening to anyone. I’ve been watching his moves, closely. I really think, for the first time in my lifetime, that we’re dealing with a real man. </p>

<p>Now, that doesn’t mean it’s a good thing. If anything, it’s <em>more dangerous</em> </p>

<p>It’s <em>not</em> scripted. We’ve gone off reservation. And maybe the media has completely pulled a fast one on all of the right wingers and maybe I’m just confused, but that Trump guy’s days are numbered. </p>

<p>When the Rothschilds are coming out of the den of snakes’ pit of hell they live in to confront Trump, and stick their reptile necks out in public, you know something is up. </p>

<p>My theory, some kind of elite turf war going on and Trump’s the muscle guy for a new group. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are partially right, but only in a very broad strokes.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re witnessing here is the war between the king (or Kings) and the usuper with his cohorts. Both side want absolute power and control, but comes from different grounds. The Kings, who while gradually loosing their grip on the serfs, still holds the church, the army and the land. Because the Kings still holds these things, the usuper has to breaking them one by one, while getting the serfs to follow and setting them up to die for him. So the fight ensured.</p>

<p>Now, Trump (as the usurper) are trying to took down the pillars of power one by one and took over, while the Kings (the shadow govt) are trying to pull his army off and took him down. So far, Trump has took down the church (the media) and the Kings are furious. So they have to employ their army (the Intel agency) to take him down. Which is why we see shit like this today since no side has full control yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what op says but I think Hillary was selected but trump was co-opted after a humiliating defeat for most of tptb. Trump is a text book narcissistic asshole, easy to control, all you gotta do is massage his ego a little or play chicken or dare him to do stuff, $ will work good too ofcourse, he&#39;s putty in multiple tptb factions hands. Perhaps both were selected, seems to me cock bros pick one side Rothschild&#39;s pick the other but if these guys loose they don&#39;t throw in the towel, they just salvage and readjust. Now trumps just being pimped out to who ever wants a turn , at least he&#39;s entertaining I suppose. </p>

<p>This is to destroy the non partisan appeal that the conspiracy community has, which often draws in new lurkers and users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Couple clarifying questions:</p>

<p>What do you mean by &quot;conspiracy community&quot;;  This sub, other sites like GLP, underground networks, or mostly independents connecting in some other way?</p>

<p>Can you demonstrate when or how said community, or communities, had a primarily non-partisan appeal in the past?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that any greater CT community has ever been non-partisan: every single one has been segregated by its own beliefs based on my experience of being in the CT game for decades.</p>

<p>Like, with Obama/Clinton’s group we were likely going to be killed gulag style. With Trump’s group, they want us alive so we can contribute to a amoral Nazi empire. </p>

<p>Just a thought </p>
