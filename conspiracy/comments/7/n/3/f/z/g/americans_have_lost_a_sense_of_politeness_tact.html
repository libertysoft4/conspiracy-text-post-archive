    <div class="md"><p>Your “best example” is answered in the second part of your post. Do you know any cops? I do, and trust me they don’t go out each morning putting their life on the line hoping to shoot someone. Your part about people being assholes is why cops act the way they do. Your question can be summarized in one answer; the breakdown of the nuclear family unit. That’s where conduct is supposed to be taught. Having respect for authority. Not arguing with cops and escalating the situation. I’ve been pulled over 6 times this year alone and not one time did I ever respond to the officer as anything other than “sir” or “ma’am” even when I didn’t think I had done anything wrong. Do you think cops want to spend the holidays working? Missing birthdays and stuff like that just to deal with piece of shit people who are just looking for confrontation? The problem isn’t the police, it’s the people who don’t respect any authority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are turning into a society of narcissists. It&#39;s what happens if we tilt too far left on the collectivism vs individualism scale. The latter(individualism) was always about everyone, as opposed to the majority, being guaranteed certain inalienable rights(dignity, freedom). That idea seems to have grown into the belief that now, individuals have carte blanche to act as they wish even at the expense of others.</p>

<p>It appears as though this was done intentionally as an act of social engineering in order to destabilize the nation and cause chaos amongst Americans. What better way to manipulate the masses through tactics like divide and conquer than to have a society of narcissists that only care about themselves?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you 100% on TV/movies being an absolute cesspool of human indignity and prostration before filth; nearly every character or plot glorifies one, more, or all of the seven deadly sins.  And that&#39;s why I don&#39;t watch any TV shows from after the early 60s.  I&#39;ll admit I watch a few recent movies here with friends, but try to suggest ones that are at least bit more &quot;decent&quot; when possible.  Even then, I try to watch from a bit of an intellectual and emotional distance so as to not be sucked in/brainwashed by the programming.</p>

<p>What really has irked me lately is how awful characters are to each other in general, but to their supposed &quot;friends&quot; in particular.  You have this group of friends in a sitcom and all they do is make fun and tear down each other.  Joshing around and friendly banter is what makes for good friendships, but these characters are just plain nasty.  E.g., have you ever seen that clip of Big Bang Theory where someone removed the laugh track?  Just terrible.</p>

<p>That show, and many others, have plots that are dependent upon one character doing something shitty to another and they magically &quot;fix&quot; it by act three, where in real life the friendships would be over and people potentially in jail.</p>

<p>As an aside,  I&#39;ve had numerous encounters with cops throughout my life and not a single one has been a dick/asshole or pulled rank.  I talk to them with the same respect and politeness I reserve for everyone IRL and they&#39;ve always done the same; I&#39;ve been in several situations where I should have received tickets, but they generously let me go.<br/>
One incident happened just three weeks ago.  Speeding 73mph in a 60mph zone.  </p>
