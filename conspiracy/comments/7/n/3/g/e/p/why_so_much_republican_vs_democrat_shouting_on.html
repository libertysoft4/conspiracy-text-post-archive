    <div class="md"><p>i guess you see what you look for.  i&#39;m not looking for it and i tend not to read the political posts because i feel they&#39;re divisive for the most part.  unless it&#39;s a divisive issue that affects me and i see manifested around me i try not to perpetuate what i perceive as a broken model.  you could be right.  it also could just be seeded there intentionally to wind people up.  this latest mod request for submission statements seems to have really decreased the amount of windy-up spam that was plaguing this sub for a while.  but maybe you&#39;re right.  i just wish people would converse accurately and avoid the broken model type arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what the original claim was, but if it was debunking the claims that this sub is &quot;a T_D circlejerk,&quot; then it was on the mark, but with shitty evidence, so here is some actual evidence. </p>

<p>There are a lot more than this, but this is what I could dig up from a quick search. Notice you never see anyone claim &quot;this sub is a T_D circlejerk&quot; in any of the anti-Trump threads. They just pretend these threads don&#39;t exist and continue with the anti-<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> propaganda, which is usually heavily upvoted in here for some reason. A lot of people in here hate this sub. </p>

<p>&quot;Drain that Swamp: Trump&#39;s Interior Chief&#39;s Hometown Friends Receive $300 Million Contract to Restore PR Power Lines - Company Only Has 2 Employees&quot; 5,340 points, 86 percent upvoted: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/78ffzd/drain_that_swamp_trumps_interior_chiefs_hometown/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/78ffzd/drain_that_swamp_trumps_interior_chiefs_hometown/</a></p>

<p>If you check the comments of supposedly &quot;pro-Trump&quot; posts, anti-Trump comments reign supreme. There&#39;s nothing really wrong with that, but the people claiming this sub is one giant pro-Trump conspiracy are deluding themselves. Some people try to claim all of this is explained because this or that post hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but that&#39;s complete bullshit. Posts that don&#39;t hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> are also very anti-Trump in the comments. Anti-Trump posts also couldn&#39;t hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> in the first place if they weren&#39;t heavily upvoted in this sub before they reached <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Donald Trump supposedly told House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) he supports cutting Social Security but will not admit it publicly because it would hurt his election chances.

<p>&quot;Dear T_D readers, Please read this post. <strong>I am ready for your downvotes.</strong> If you are a trump supporter who also visits this sub, here is a message for you. The_Donald is one of the most heavily censored subs on reddit. Try posting anything that questions the supremacy of Donald Trump. Your post will get removed and you will be banned.&quot; 1,200 points, 84 percent upvoted: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6chgbe/dear_t_d_readers_please_read_this_post_i_am_ready/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6chgbe/dear_t_d_readers_please_read_this_post_i_am_ready/</a></p>

<p>There are also a lot of posts that say &quot;Fuck both sides.&quot; Examples:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5xt35u/its_really_time_to_wake_the_fuck_up_hillary/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5xt35u/its_really_time_to_wake_the_fuck_up_hillary/</a></p>

<p>To the people who claim anti-Trump comments can be explained because some threads in this sub make it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, I&#39;ll show you a few threads that are below a 1000 with anti-Trump comments. In fact, many of the posts above never made it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but to be conservative, I&#39;ll keep the threshold under a 1000 to guarantee that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regulars are the ones making and upvoting these comments. </p>

<p>Check out the top comment on this 755 upvote anti-Trump post: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/76qr7j/just_a_friendly_reminder_that_trumps_labor/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/76qr7j/just_a_friendly_reminder_that_trumps_labor/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, wrong party. Won&#39;t get traction. Change the name trump to Hillary to get the conspiracy community to take notice&quot;</p>

<p>Also this thread. Just look at the comments and which ones are upvoted or downvoted. Pay attention to that from now on and the propaganda just doesn&#39;t make any sense anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sure isn&#39;t racial division.</p>

<p>If I put myself or someone I trust in power of distributing food, health care, housing, or education, I know that people will be treated fair and equally.  There is a human component of compassion and also a human component that deeply desires efficiency.  How else would we have strived to develop tools and make it this far?  How would we have come together tribally, then in villages?</p>

<p>People who want to put the power solely in individuals are corrupted by self-interest.</p>

<p>Simple as that.  You either feel compassion and the sanctity of human life and believe we can develop distributed human systems to care for our needs, or--based on your own self knowledge of corruption--want to keep things out of anyone else&#39;s hands.</p>

On reddit conversations arent just for the benefit of the people talking but others who see those posts.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Any decent conspiracy theorist knows two party system is just a puppet show - pseudo choice.</p>

<p>&quot;The chief problem of American political life for a long time has been how to make the two Congressional parties more national and international. The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can “throw the rascals out” at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy … [E]ither party in office becomes in time corrupt, tired, unenterprising, and vigorless. Then it should be possible to replace it, every four years if necessary, by the other party, which will be none of those things but will still pursue, with new vigor, approximately the same basic policies.&quot; Prof. Carroll Quigley in &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot; (one of Bill Clinton&#39;s political mentors)</p>

Threads from here could look like a mirror of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> or <a href="/r/conservative">/r/conservative</a>. I&#39;m not sure what that depends on, but maybe it&#39;s depending on which group of shills/trolls has brigaded a thread. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s one example, but there are many more if you pay attention: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7m921i/friends_theorists_countrymen_lend_me_your_ears/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7m921i/friends_theorists_countrymen_lend_me_your_ears/</a></p>

<p>If I find it, I&#39;ll edit in this one I remember with people defending snopes at all costs.</p>

<p>Look at what the comments say, which comments were downvoted, upvoted, and by how much. What was said and what went on in that thread would never have happened here a few years ago. It seems that people are prevented from figuring out that there is a lot of nuance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anybody left in this sub who still keep ties to any individual party is missing the entire point of this sub. Granted, it&#39;s a theory in the technical sense, but I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that the major parties in the US have different agendas from the party members they &quot;represent.&quot; The only way to remove corruption from politics in general, is to remove any material benefit from serving in office. Serving in office, in the purest sense, should be benefit-by-beneficial policy. In other words, the only reason/motivation to serving in office is the betterment if the citizenry. I believe in capitalism, when there isnt corporate interests holding the entire economy together; meanwhile the majority of Americans are just getting by. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just a byproduct of trying times. When things in the world get particularly precarious, partisanship rises. This is a natural reaction for human beings: when things get tough, people tend to fall in around their in-group.</p>

<p>The last few years are particularly bad because: 
* The internet amplifies voice, and provides the illusion of large scale support (internet bubbles).
* Governments, corporations, and political movements, utilizing AI and social media, have an unprecedented capability for propaganda and social influence (by hiding the provenance of information in the anonymity of the net).
*  Globalization is pushing very diverse cultures and diverse problems in those cultures together into one big mix. We are unequipped and too uneducated to deal with the problems of vastly different cultures -- yet we have the capability of interacting with them, regardless of our knowledge. </p>

<p>I think it is important people monitor their own behavior online. Try to be as cool as possible. No one will ever agree with everyone else. Say your piece, keep as cool as possible. Move on (preferably without saying so or why) if you feel nothing good is coming out of a particular dialogue or argument.  We can change the atmosphere only by demanding better of ourselves and engaging with each other respectfully.  Understand anger, but do not respond to it with anger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the right deify Trump as if he is some anti-globalist hero who will dismantle the NWO, drain the swamp, etc when he has done nothing but appoint swamp creatures to his cabinet, pass tax cuts for the insanely wealthy, continue the Zionist agenda, and working to dismantle government that helps the lower and working class.</p>

<p>Alex Jones is controlled opposition and poisons the well with pro-Trump propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took a short break from conspiracies when I was dealing with personal issues,  and then I came back 6 months later.  Immediately it was apparent to me just how much of t_d had bled over into this sub.  To the extent that i get partisan it&#39;s just too push back at what I see to be a disturbing number of Trump cheerleaders shitting all over the place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub is starting to look a lot like r/politics. All the dem vs rep bullshit. But also people really putting their trust in  NYT articles, and other mainstream sources that have been proven to be full of shit. People still pushing trump Russian collusion. I remember when this sub actually had some good discussions and not a bunch of partisan dick riders.</p>
