        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recently started trying to read more, specifically about the things that intrigue me, like consciousness, remote viewing, aliens. I read Russel Targ’s The Reality of ESP and I throughly enjoyed it. I then started reading The Twelfth Planet by Zecharia Sitchin and I was fascinated with it...until about half way through when I decided to look into it, realizing it’s pretty well accepted that the authors information is basically nonsense. So I guess my question is: what are some must read books that are factual and intriguing, relating to things such as consciousness, aliens, basically the things that are commonly ignored and looked at as the interests of loonies. Something that makes you sit there and wonder if what is commonly accepted as truth is, in fact, wrong. </p>

<p>Very empowering, about how modern &quot;christianity&quot; is nothing like Jesus preached, which you can see for yourself in the un-adultered parts of the bible and by testing his words for yourself. Basically: &quot;love is the answer, but don&#39;t trust me, see for yourself by acting in love&quot;. Very thorough, accessible, and convincing, but again: see for yourself!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a link to the CIA&#39;s recommended reading list in the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/stargate">STAR GATE</a> collection of their reading room.</p>

<p>Project Star Gate is the declassified remote viewing research program conducted by the CIA.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00789R003300210001-2.pdf">Project Star Gate Summary</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R002000240008-7.pdf">CIA Recommended Reading List</a></p>

<p>Out of that list I would recommend:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/376895.Stalking_the_Wild_Pendulum"> Stalking the Wild Pendulum: On the Mechanics of Consciousness
</a>by Itzhak Bentov.</p>

<p>Bentov was highly referenced in an analysis of the Gateway Project, which was a course created by Robert Monroe of the Monroe Institute for the purpose of accelerating progress towards altered states of consciousness.  Fun fact, Bentov also designed Israel&#39;s first rocket. <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Books/A-someone-to-love">Source</a></p>

<p>As for books, I have a ton I could recommend, but I would start with &#39;Penetration&#39; by Ingo Swann. Thats got conciousness, aliens, and Remote Viewing all in 1 amazing book, written by the man that coined the term &quot;Remote Viewing.&quot;</p>

<p>This topic is my bread, and butter. Feel free to PM me, and I can try to suggest the best books based on what you want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s got a lot of great books, and many can be downloaded for free as pdfs. &#39;Penetration&#39; is the best starter though. He also started a &quot;History of Remote Viewing&quot; online, but died before completing it. Still worth reading though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few more books, less about actual conspiracies, and more about the nature of perception and reality would be:</p>

<p>Reasons and Persons – by Derek Parfit (an in-depth look at psychological reasons for all manner of actions taken by man)</p>

<p>Modern Man in Search for a Soul, as well as Man and his Symbols – by Carl G. Jung (a study of psychological archetypes and symbols throughout time. Still highly relevant if you want to understand people&#39;s motivations and beliefs, as well as the stories we tell ourselves)</p>

<p>Ishmael, My Ishmael, and The Story of B – by Daniel Quinn (a story across three books about individuals with a genuine desire to save the world, and what such a journey may entail. The Story of B is particularly interesting, as it sheds some light on the Jesuit order and their potential motivations for deception)</p>

<p>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of The Bicameral Mind – by Julian Jaynes (discussing how man&#39;s mental dynamics evolved from automatisms to conscious self-awareness and choice through the &quot;invention&quot; or discovery of metaphor and other mental structures, leading to the death of our gods and the establishment of God within (something like that))</p>

<p>Siddharta – by Hermann Hesse (A must-read work on some of the eternal concepts of easter philosophy, as well as personal growth and spiritual realization. A great guide to life, along with all his other works, from Steppenwolf to The Glass Bead Game)</p>

<p>Meditations – by Marcus Aurelius (a principal guide on Stoic philosophy)</p>

<p>The Doors of Perception – by Aldous Huxley (describing his experience of an afternoon on mescaline, relating it to transcendental experiences of many kinds, from gold to fireworks, along the way)</p>

<p>Gödel, Escher, Bach – by Douglas Hofstadter (this is the next book on my reading list, so I haven&#39;t yet begun. It supposedly illuminates aspects of the recursive/synchronistic/or even holographic nature of reality by drawing parallels between Gödel&#39;s mathematics, Escher&#39;s art, and Bach&#39;s musical compositions, and extending those to DNA, computer code, and a range of other domains.) </p>
