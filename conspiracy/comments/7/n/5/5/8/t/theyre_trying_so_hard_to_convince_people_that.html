<p>Let me assure you, many Iranians are angry with the corruption within their government who aren&#39;t paid to protest.  </p>

<p>By the way...many many people who are fortunate enough to still be alive in Syria consider the FSA to be terrorists. Not that the FSA gives a shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Important to realize this. Regime changes are seldom grassroots. The protests that lead to them can be.   </p>

<p>The right questions, in my opinion, are the ones that look down the path at both the forces that want Iranian leadership t stay where it is and those that want it overturned, and see what, exactly,  those people think would be best in the region...and why. </p>

<p>The protests and the PR campaigns behind them are inconsequential in the long run. </p>

<p>The two questions are:</p>

<p>(1) What are the political and policy aims behind the main groups of protestors and;</p>

<p>(2) To what extent is a repeat of 1979 preventable, where very &quot;genuine&quot; protests against corruption were co-opted by radical theocrats who then took over the country for nearly 40 years now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people don&#39;t realize in the dynamics of Iran. The government is much more authoritarian and religious than the populace.</p>

<p>Curious note, being a chess player/fan following large tournaments. Iranian chess players automatically forfeit to Isreali chess players. This is sports wide I&#39;m told. Two Iranian expat masters broke this rule and got kicked out of the Iranian national team and forbid from playing any tournaments in the country.</p>

<p>Everything I&#39;ve seen and witnessed portrays a populace much less extreme than the oppressive religious government. These protests fit the bill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course Iranians are mad that their country is a pariah (thanks to israel and the US) and that the oil price is still in the gutter ( thanks US and Saudis). But anyone with a brain has the right to be skeptical of any &quot;popular uprising&quot; going back to at least the french revolution. Iranians need to know israel/US will NEVER accept them until they have a subservient quisling government whose main role is to SELL THEM OUT. Guys, the most hardliner Shia theocracy is preferable to what the zionists have planned for you.</p>
