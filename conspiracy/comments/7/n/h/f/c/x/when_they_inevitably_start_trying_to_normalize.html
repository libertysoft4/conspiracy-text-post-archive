Its a matter of getting people used to the technology and understanding it will be the only way to keep them  and their money safe.  Walk into the grocery store and walk out, no checkers, it just scans your chip and deducts from your account and sends you an email of your receipt.  The world will run much more efficiently, but there will be no privacy.

    <div class="md"><p>Yale prof. Dr. Jose Delgado was a mind control doctor who committed great atrocities. MKultra was said to be a limited hangout to distract from the more nefarious Project Bluebird. Delgado did a lot of work with brain implants he developed called &quot;stimoceivers.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://www.wanttoknow.info/bluebird10pg">https://www.wanttoknow.info/bluebird10pg</a></p>

<p>Later in his life, he conceded that microchip impants are now passe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Do you remember how we thought of Franco?&quot; says his wife. &quot;Imagine being able to turn off the Generalisimo.&quot; Delgado responds &quot;But who could have put the electrodes into the dictator? With electromagnetic radiation we could have controlled the dictator from a distance. We did some experiments at Yale where we influenced the brain from up to 30 meters away.&quot; </p>

<p>We take up Delgado&#39;s research on electromagnetic fields and their effect on people. &quot;I could later do with electro-magnetic radiation what I did with the stimoceiver. It&#39;s much better because there&#39;s no need for surgery,&quot; he explains. </p>
