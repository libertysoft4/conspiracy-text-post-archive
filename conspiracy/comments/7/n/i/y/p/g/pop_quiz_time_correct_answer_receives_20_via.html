<p>CIA has been very naughty, since they want to pull the amusing one headlight V2K trick on top of their endless helicopter flybys of me, I will pull this pop quiz.</p>

<p>Edit 1</p>

<p>Dead man switch is already in place, so if they try anything else funny, more than I alone will know the secret. I live in Dallas, Texas.</p>

<p>Edit 2</p>

<p>Also if you&#39;ve been having internet problems in Dallas lately... well it&#39;s not my fault CIA are psycho faggots and need to track me wherever I go by fucking with the DNS of everybody in the whole fucking city.</p>

<p><a href="http://downdetector.com/status/spectrum/map/">http://downdetector.com/status/spectrum/map/</a> Read the comments. Notice where the complaints are concentrated... also fyi one guy I used to talk to was based in Kentucky, another in Wisconsin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know his dad was involved with Operation Crossroads as well as a lot of research into nuclear science (submarines and medicine) but it&#39;s probably due to the last two years of his life.  He toured around giving lectures on UFO&#39;s and black budget projects by the government. If you&#39;re looking for a specific event, he revealed in 1954 the Greada Treaty which allowed extraterrestrials to abduct humans and implant them as long as they notified the government of who was a subject of their testing. He later stated that the extraterrestrials had stopped informing government officials and were now abducting people freely. Hopefully I didn&#39;t miss anything!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire DFW area is having trouble and they are continuing to lie to all of us about. I live in what I guess you would call a suburb of Dallas, about 24 miles north of Dallas. And EVERYONE in this city is experiencing horrible service, bad service, no service, DNS servers are down. And eventually it has gotten to where when you call them, they act like you&#39;re lying about your shit not working . </p>

<p>Another thing...</p>

<p>The city I live in there has been lots of grey colored helicopters that have been flying around in the early afternoon to rush hour. 
One day in particular, a friend of mine messaged me to tell me and about that time my sons ran it and told me. They also said it 
looked weird. So I do what I normally do, I go to a Facebook group where we all ask each other about weird noises, people, cars
you name it. Well I got a message from a 911 dispatcher that I have known since she was a little girl. And it said, &quot;That thing, that
thing you posted about, you don&#39;t need to worry about it.&quot;. She didn&#39;t say why, or anything. I thought that to be really fucking weird, 
I have not talked to her since. Well about 2 hours later. There is a post in all of groups like the one I was talking about on Facebook 
and that particular Facebook group, from one of our local newspapers. The post stated that the city I live in police department, was 
assisting the DEA in an arrest. This is quoted verbatim, I just left my city out:</p>

<p>___________________Police were in process of assisting federal agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration Friday night, Nov. 17 in several locations in the city.  The DEA had a helicopter involved in its surveillance mission that several people reported seeing in posts on social media, causing some alarm.</p>

<p>I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO POSTED ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!! YIKES!! 😳</p>

<p>And our internet to this day is messed up like so bad. I am setting here and it tells me on my smart tv &quot;there is no internet connection&quot; 
then I will watch my phone, my desktop, my other phone and a little laptop I use all lose connection. When I go to the internet settings 
on any of those. Our SSID is 100% completely gone even on the LAN connection. I will refresh refresh and it takes it a moment to come back . But out router shows no sign of any loss of connection. </p>

<p>Or my TV, phones and my kids tablets will say they have NO internet connection but do. </p>

<p>It is not just me it is A LOT of people in this town.</p>

<p>We use hella internet...</p>

<p>like in one day 61 GB we play lots of games, we stream, we youtube, netflix</p>

<p>And there is one week in Nov, it was Nov 15 to Nov 26 and we have no data usage NOTHING! 
I seen that shit and I called Spectrum.... They said the same thing, he asked me if we was on
vacation or something ?</p>

<p>2 days after I made that post! This shit happens? What in the actual fuck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the helicopter harassment, everything. Phone is tapped, laptop compromised, everything. The funny thing is all of this is over some obscure information that was posted publically online. I&#39;m not some foreign spy or anything. Just some random dude reading and linking shit online I find interesting.</p>

<p>And I am almost 100pc certain the CIA is behind the widespread internet disruptions in DFW, and seemingly throughout parts of the US. You can check Down Detector for all ISPs, people are reporting the same problems, so it&#39;s not an issue with any particular ISP. I know for a fact that at one point they even disrupted 911 emergency call services in a particular city here in DFW, which could have easily gotten people killed. National Security my ass.</p>
