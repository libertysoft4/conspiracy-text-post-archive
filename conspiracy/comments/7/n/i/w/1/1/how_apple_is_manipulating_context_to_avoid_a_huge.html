<p>The original complaint was that Apple was intentionally slowing down previous model iphones so people would want to upgrade sooner. </p>

<p>Apple wants to avoid a huge class action lawsuit payout so they spun the story to be that &quot;we slowed down phones to protect older phones battery usage!&quot; BULLSHIT. </p>

<p>They came up with this phony story so they could promote the &quot;goodwill gesture&quot; of replacement batteries that they get to also collect $29 per battery exchange so it essentially gets the upgrader to agree that they won&#39;t participate in a class action in the future.</p>

<p>IN NO WAY does that solve they problem of Apple intentionally slowing down peoples phones. It&#39;s a cover to protect them from making people&#39;s iphones feel obsolete in a faster time frame. </p>

<p>Total scam.</p>

<p>Except you <em>can</em> replace it yourself relatively easily (~$20) or pay a 3rd party repair shop to do it (~$30-70). Those are hardly &quot;exorbitant&quot; costs. </p>

<p>So lets be clear for a second: any device that contains a consumable component totally has a EOL (end of life) date. The question is how far out that date is, and what (if anything) a consumer can do to mitigate that date. This is true for every phone; LiIo battery tech is what it is. I hardly see how Apple is unique in their handling of this aspect of their phones. Like all other major manufacturers their batteries will eventually degrade and you can choose to replace your phone, or pay to replace the battery. </p>

<p>I also covered how they can easily take it in (to a third party or to Apple) and pay a relatively small price (relative to the cost of the phone) to have them replace the battery.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>making the design inherently anti-consumer, since its not that hard to design a phone that has a battery that is removed without needing special tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Easy on the hyperbole. There are plenty of reasons that basically the whole industry moved to sealed phone designs as soon as LiIo tech progressed to the point where it could support a  ~2 year life. (Vastly improved ability to waterproof, more efficient space utilization due to the removal of mounting hardware, etc). You&#39;re welcome to disagree with those reasons and argue a &quot;removable battery&quot; is more important, but acting like there aren&#39;t straightforward and valid reasons for the industry-wide shift is just silly. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You should read past click-bait headlines my friend. Apple doesn&#39;t want to outlaw third party repairs (and even if they did, such a law would almost certainly be overturned very quickly). They are lobbying against laws that require manufacturers to disclose and provide all diagnostics tools and software access to third parties/users. There are plenty of reasons for this. As Apple themselves notes in the quote from your article, one of the main reasons is biometrics. </p>

<p>Biometrics rely on UID entangled codes that link the sensor(s) to the secure enclave. In order to prevent hacking attempts, the enclave will recognize/reject any attempt to substitute a new sensor or hack around the security by messing with the hardware. If the sensor has to be replaced/repaired it has to be done with Apple so that the pairing can be re-validated. If they were prohibited by overly broad laws (like the one in question) from placing software restrictions on certain types of repairs (like biometrics) they would basically be forced to open a massive back door in their security architecture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn’t do it to “save battery life”. They did it to stop shutdowns.</p>

<p>A simple example - when you overclock your CPU, you can increase the frequency to a point that your power supply cannot supply enough electricity for the system to boot. It shuts down straight away.</p>

<p>When a battery degrades, in some situations it cannot provide enough voltage to the CPU so the phone shuts down.</p>

<p>What Apple did was for the phones with degraded batteries, rather than have the CPU complete all the work at once, requiring a lot of volts, it uses a series of peaks which require a lower frequency, this stops the phone crashing. </p>

<p>Now whether or not all of that , they have done on purpose so people upgrade their phones, I’m not sure of. </p>

<p>But one thing is for sure - if it turns out to be true that they have done this on purpose to brick older phones, they will lose 90% of their customers. </p>

<p>I mean there are many engineering reasons to make the phone sealed. (Vastly improved ability to waterproof, more efficient space utilization due to the removal of mounting hardware, etc). You can totally disagree with their decision and argue the benefits of a removable battery outweigh the cons, but its not like there aren&#39;t valid reasons the whole industry pretty much moved to sealed designs as soon as LiIo tech improved to a point where they could last ~2 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, let me explain again.</p>

<p>Firstly - yes, the CPU voltage is dynamic. Meaning, the frequency and voltage will only increase when required.</p>

<p>The problem was - when the CPU required this frequency and voltage, the degraded battery was not able to provide this and the phone crashed. </p>

<p>What Apple did was reduce the frequency and voltage required during these peaks so that the degraded battery was able to supply the required volts and the phone did not crash. </p>

<p>I have answered your question multiple times.</p>

<p>What they have introduced is software to monitor the health of your battery whilst monitoring all other aspects of your device, to dynamically adjust the frequency and voltage of your CPU to ensure that your phone doesn’t shut down. </p>

<p>That is why changing the battery fixed the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I understand it. You&#39;re just accepting their bullshit lie about it when they clocked the CPUs lower than nessasary to give the false impression of your phone slowing down. This is just the excuse the idiots buy. </p>

<p>No software update is going to magically make your phone run on less voltage. If iphones were crashing on peek performance when the CPUs weren&#39;t clocking back enough properly, which you say this update fixed. Then when did this start happening and what iPhones are affected?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I think I understand why you’re confused </p>

<p>Let me explain this </p>

<p>Your CPU CANNOT adjusts its own frequency or voltage depending on the SUPPLY OF POWER.</p>

<p>What it does, is it changes its frequency and power depending on its NEEDS.</p>

<p>If it needs 2.0GHZ and 1.3v it’s going to ASK for this. If it doesn’t get it, the phone crashes.</p>

<p>What Apple has done, is written code into iOS to allow the phone to calculate an “upper limit” of frequency and voltage that the CPU can request, depending on the current health of the battery. </p>

<p>Does that make sense now?</p>

<p>I cannot attest to the longevity of the current battery, I plug it in every night and do not use it while driving. Generally use it for shopping lists, navigation, phone calls in stores, texting, bubble level for woodworking, and for light photography. (None of these phones are really a camera) I honestly don&#39;t think I could get a full daylight of heavy use out of it, but I do have access to car/home and a portable battery pack (like you can jump a car, but about the same size as another phone)</p>

<p>Okay... so where is your proof of this? Nothing that has come out in this recent saga confirms this suspicion. It shows selective throttling in specific high-voltage draw circumstances on devices with degraded batteries. It isn&#39;t a wholesale &quot;slow down&quot; of all old devices. </p>

<p>Furthermore, why the heck would they even do that in the first place if their goal was to drive new phone sales? A central tenant of driving loyalty/repurchase behavior is providing a quality product experience for the duration of usage and <em>particularly</em> at end of life when consumers are considering their replacement/next purchase. Intentionally screwing with phones right when people are in this stage of purchase evaluation would be silly. </p>

If your device pulls too much power, you either have to reduce the power usage or increase the power you can supply.</p>

<p>Apple here decided to go the &quot;It just works&quot; route and decided to decrease the power usage when enough power cannot be supplied.
(And now they&#39;re discounting battery changes, which fixes the issue by increasing the power available to the device. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that this issue has nothing to do with battery life, it has to do with battery <em>health</em>. The problem isn&#39;t with phones getting decreased life. The problem is that aging batteries eventually reach a point where they can&#39;t supply the peak voltage that may be required in high draw situations. This can cause random sporadic shutdowns to protect the electronics. The throttling is designed to recognize degraded batteries and to spread peak performance request out over several CPU cycles so that they don&#39;t cause the phone to shutdown due to a overly high voltage draw. </p>

<p>I mean there are many engineering reasons to make the phone sealed. (Vastly improved ability to waterproof, more efficient space utilization due to the removal of mounting hardware, etc). You can totally disagree with their decision and argue the benefits of a removable battery outweigh the cons, but its not like there aren&#39;t valid reasons the whole industry pretty much moved to sealed designs as soon as LiIo tech improved to a point where they could last ~2 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that 7 years is at the outer limit of a laptop running modern current day software well &amp; updating the hardware is the only choice.</p>

<p>But Apple is slowing down hardware that should have at least 4-5 years of service at the very next iphone/ipad release.</p>

<p>I&#39;m opposed to that. I think about people who scrimp &amp; save to buy Apple should get at least 5 years of decent performance &amp; they don&#39;t because Apple is slowing down powerful modern processors so they lag. It&#39;s not &quot;to help save the battery&quot;.</p>
