    <div class="md"><p>Very nearly, I suppose.

    <div class="md"><p>Personally all I think that would be different is transparency. I think we are completely under the control of a world government.

    <div class="md"><p>True enough. I suppose it&#39;s less about Russia not wanting to sign up, more about them wanting a bigger piece of the action, join as partners rather than associates. Still, they&#39;re a sticking point.</p>

<p>Issue is transparency, as you say - but it cuts both ways. Even if the system is already fully in place, keeping it secret even partially means limiting its ability to act under its own legitimacy. Everything has to be done in backrooms and pushed out mob-style, with bribery and intimidation and the like - inefficient, and more than that impermanent.</p>

<p>Keeping it secret also means that anyone who is &#39;let in on it&#39; is free to do all sorts of counterproductive self-serving things, safe in the knowledge that the &#39;real&#39; authorities can&#39;t punish them, for fear of being revealed themselves.</p>

<p>The only way to make it legitimate, permanent etc. is to formalize it publically, or at least semi-publically. But they&#39;ve tied themselves in such ridiculous knots these past few decades, trying to rush to the finish line before the OGs start croaking, it&#39;s hard to imagine how that would be possible, at least without large amounts of violence, which could just as easily fuck up the whole thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair points. My personal belief is this. I believe the current system being used on citizens of the world is there to drive income equality.  Every year the middle class gets poorer and the top 1 percent get much more wealthy.  I believe the elites of the world benefit from the current system because they are bleeding the economy dry.  Once there is no more wealth to deplete from the masses they pull the pin toss the grenade and were in a martial law type of one world government.  That could take a hundred years or it could take 10 or it could 1000, but that&#39;s a personal theory I hold. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get where you&#39;re coming from. Tho when you say &#39;the middle class gets poorer&#39;, you&#39;re talking about the West - the middle classes in India, China etc. are getting richer at the same time, and for obvious directly-related reasons. Logical end result being a &#39;global middle class&#39;, equalized across all nations. Whether that&#39;s an explicit goal or just the natural result of globalisation (as a technological phenomenon as well as a socio-political project) - who knows.</p>

<p>As for pulling the pin, martial law and so on, I doubt it&#39;s a specific ambition, just the obvious fallback plan if/when all the gentler approaches fail.</p>

<p>Only other thing to mention (relating to your 10 years or 1000 comment) - I think we&#39;re looking at a much shorter time-frame, at least for the next attempt. For one, a lot of the turbo-globalist true believers are reaching the ends of their lifespans, for them personally it&#39;s now-or-never. </p>

<p>And for two, everything&#39;s falling apart, the sheer amount of lying required to keep the project chugging along is causing problems wherever you look. Trump and Brexit being the most obvious cases - both in globalist heartlands, both explicitly the anti-globalist option - and both shadowed on the other end of the political spectrum by anti-globalist lefties, Bernie and Corbyn. So long as the chosen tactic to actually promote globalism is to pretend it doesn&#39;t really exist and anyone who talks about it is a bad idiot, I can&#39;t see the scales tipping back in their direction any time soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent points especially about how a lot of Asian countries middle class is growing.  If I&#39;m being cynical I would argue they are on a course just like we were when the industrial revolution took off and the American middle class was doing unusually well.  If my theory were true the one world government would want to take those asian countries on the same paths that they took us.  If the middle class is doing well they are collecting a lot of income tax from those countries for the International banking cartel. </p>

<p>Where I will disagree with you is that you claim the system is falling apart.  I personally don&#39;t think we have ever been as controlled as we are today.  People slurp up whatever is FB trending, everyone not using a vpn is building a surveillance file on themselves, people are willing paying for spy devices to be placed into their homes, and microchips are a hotter conversation than ever before.  </p>

<p>I get that I am a bit out there, but I truthfully think the internet was a wolf in sheeps clothing.  The people get it and it appears to allow is us all to connect and share ideas, but the NSA has access to this information and computer algorithm could spit out a list of a majority of dissenters and they could be promptly rounded up by Military police.  I think things like brexit and trump exist simply to give people the impression that they have choice. </p>

The only hope to draw from them is that they show the old methods of information control don&#39;t work any more - or at least not as well as they used to, not well enough to win the day. And the new methods, the ones shitting up this sub on a daily basis, aren&#39;t working either - if anything they&#39;re making it worse, they let people see these arguments first hand, play around with them, contest them, see for themselves how hollow and synthetic they are.</p>

<p>Not to say the truth is winning out, mind you, nothing of the sort. Just that the age-old methods for propagating the &#39;noble lies&#39; are steadily failing, so for the first time in decades if not centuries if not millennia the truth is in with a chance. A Great Awakening - still a long shot, but closer now than it&#39;s ever been in my lifetime, and ~80% of that movement has been in the last 3-4 years.</p>

<p>All of which makes the violent option more likely in the end, I suppose. So much for optimism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most authorities, however, agree on the following account. The whole of Egypt was once plagued by a wasting disease which caused bodily disfigurement. So pharaoh Bocchorisnote went to the oracle of Hammonnote to ask for a cure, and was told to purify his kingdom by expelling the victims to other lands, as they lay under a divine curse. Thus a multitude of sufferers was rounded up, herded together, and abandoned in the wilderness. Here the exiles tearfully resigned themselves to their fate. But one of them, who was called Moses, urged his companions not to wait passively for help from god or man, for both had deserted them: they should trust to their own initiative and to whatever guidance first helped them to extricate themselves from their present plight. They agreed, and started off at random into the unknown. But exhaustion set in, chiefly through lack of water, and the level plain was already strewn with the bodies of those who had collapsed and were at their last gasp when a herd of wild asses left their pasture and made for the spade of a wooded crag. Moses followed them and was able to bring to light a number of abundant channels of water whose presence he had deduced from a grassy patch of ground. This relieved their thirst. They traveled on for six days without a break, and on the seventh they expelled the previous inhabitants of Canaan, took over their lands and in them built a holy city and temple.</p>

<p>:) think of passover. </p>

<p>Think of the splitting up of languages. Now, you have to realize that the jews are translators throughout history. They have learned how to cheat with words. The reason race mixing is bad is because it creates fake language, words within words, and you lose coherence. Burning bush was really meant to be bush of life, source of water, just like in the time of Aristotle virgin birth meant pure conception of spirit, one with Nature. Anyways, the lose of language allows for justification of sin to take place --&gt; Babel. </p>

<p>Back to egypt though, what was the disease? Genetic deformities from race mixing? Is that why they killed the first borns? If not was it inbreeding to the extreme? I would treat the above passage like a rosetta stone for reading the bible. The first known instance of the bible is 300AD, notice how the Christianity, the religion of the slaves is a lot like egyptian mythology... Wouldn&#39;t it be poetic to enslave the people you refuse to forgive with their myths? jews like to pretend to be ignorant... forgive them they know not what they do... They never realized their lie would lead to a bigger truth... and they have been doing damage control ever since. </p>

<p>And the kicker: wouldn&#39;t genetically deformed peoples <em>need</em> a goyim.... </p>

<p>Read the rest of what Tacitus had to say, I think you will enjoy how close you are to the truth:  </p>

<p>So what do you think the disease was? I know that Jews are susceptible to certain diseases, like Tay-Sachs and hemophilia, but not of deformities. I also haven&#39;t heard much about deformities being cause by race-mixing.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So what do you think the disease was? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea, yet. My hunch is that it was race mixing. Hemophillia and tay-sachs are more of inbreeding issue, but the origin of tay-sachs may be whatever this disease was. FYI tay-sachs is due to ashkanazi population being reduced to 350 or so, followed by heavy heavy inbreeding. While you can get high IQs from heavy inbreeding (Japan, China, etc.), there is a price (bi-modal distribution). Personally, I think jews mated with sub-Saharan africans (egyptian slaves). The extreme difference in genetic makeup would make their union very difficult. At the time, the egyptians may have tried to breed it out by killing hebrew men and mating with women. This is interesting for the context of the God asking abraham to kill his son... I intend to look into this aspect a lot more, and do not want to over reach my knowledge. </p>

<p>As for sources, look at race mixing stats, iq charts, all of it. This information is so taboo it is scattered. Anatomy of Violence by Adriane Raine, Steven Pinker books, Bell Curve good places to start. After that, you have to go to pre 1930s books. Sir Andrew Keane&#39;s works are top rated, explains the five origins of humans and that we likely did not all come out of Africa, he even has sections on the jews. Coon is also a good read, especially considering is brain size work has been validated by MRI. I forget the name, but there is also a human genetics book that talks about heredity of traits throughout society. Eugenics is also a good place to look. Medicine, Mind, and the Double Brain will shed light on physiological battle that reasonable people lost... Brocca was a die hard liberal, until he learned how the brain actually worked. Their &quot;racism&quot; was not a choice, but a fact. </p>

<p>Metaphors. </p>

<p>The only reason western civilization is what it is is due to the first inquisition. It was a selection process for kindness and faith. Was it all built on a lie, the jews trying to manipulate a perfect goyim? Maybe. But evil cannot hold itself together, God uses the Devil.  </p>

<p>But here we are. And now we have the chance to become something better. Our ancestors built the foundations of civilization... </p>

<p>Now we can build heaven and beyond. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for more links! I devour this info, I&#39;m really thirsty for the truth and you seem to have a lot of knowledge on this subject. I knew nothing about conversos, for example, until you mentioned them. A few more pieces of the puzzle are coming together for me, especially regarding the East India Company.</p>

<p>I have a somewhat random question if you don&#39;t mind. This morning I was reading about Andriy Biletsky of Ukraine this morning, and either he or someone else in Azov claimed that Putin is a crypto Jew.</p>

<p>I had never really considered this, and always sort of thought that Putin was probably looking out for the best interests of ethnic Russians. But maybe not? And maybe globalist opposition to him is manufactured in order to give him credibility? Or maybe there are more than one faction of Jews vying for power? Or maybe that&#39;s all disinfo? What&#39;s your take?</p>

<p>Look up what he did to the russian oligarchs, and soros. I doubt they endorsed that (unless this was a war of jews), but that is the problem with building on deceit... Distinguishing between the effects of the hive mind and the individual gets difficult, especially when they constantly hedge their bets. It is easy to see gravity work, but tracking the actual atoms is impossible. </p>

<p>The big help here is that Russia has a central bank, meaning their balls are and always will be in the jews&#39; hands. There is a reason Putin says the jews did the bolshevik revolution and is investigating the murder of he Tsar by them. Given Putin was also picked just before the information age, it is possible they did not realize his true character. Yeltzin did collapse rather quickly, so maybe they panicked, or maybe they needed a way to regain confidence of russian people.  </p>

<p>This game is a web of fuzzy logic.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>ashkenazi vs. sephardic. Look at US election results for jews. 75% - 25% democrat and republican, precisely the religious split. ashkenazi behavioral issues draw too much attention to sephardic, the sephardic use them as a scape goat for their egos and vice versa. My hunch is that all of this shit we are currently seeing is that battle. </p>

<p>jews jewing jews, jews jewing themselves... no one can tell who is jewing who anymore. That is honestly the biggest issue. That is also why they will fail. </p>

<p>there are ways to implement global governance without global gov.  firstly you need agreement on language that everyone can read.  this will probably mean the creation of a global language that&#39;s also machine readable and human readable regardless of what language you actually speak.  i think this will manifest as a set of idioms that can be mapped to the language of their choice, and those idioms will act as functions that take arguments.  it will somewhat lisp-y, because this is the best way to grow a design phi-ly.  and they&#39;ll phi design in their implementation.  i&#39;m expecting this language to show up by at min 2030 when people globally have realized that shit, they really need to work on this.</p>

<p>secondly any concept of global governance but not global gov has to allow for a spectrum of different local implementations.  there&#39;s no getting around this requirement.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually a really good question.</p>

<p>I think a the larger a government gets, the more unaccountable it gets. The people in government get more power and more ways to abuse their power.</p>

<p>Its actually why I think Federalism was a mistake. And the abolition of slavery was a great thing, but the Civil War fucked us for reasons that most people do not seem to take into account.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the best government would be a small, local one, where you personally know your elected representatives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats a good question, and the answer is simple:</p>

<p>all government should be as close to the individual as possible.</p>

<p>The farther removed sovereign individuals are in terms of layers of bureaucracy  the less that individual is represented, and the greater the chance of corruption and behind-the-scenes shadow control.</p>

<p>So if you are in favor of a global leviathan 1984-style dominating and all-encompassing big brother, then yes, one world government is what you want. Central planning. Also called Socialism and  Communism.  Any pretense of individual liberties would be just that, and illusion and a pretense.</p>

<p>This is how the EU works right now, in my opinion.  The elected member country parliament merely rubber stamps the proposed laws and regs from the <strong>APPOINTED</strong> &quot;commission&quot; from Brussells......IOW the average EU citizen is ruled over as a slave class from afar.  No accountability to the self-appointed rulers. They are kings with a different name.</p>

<p>The USA was FOUNDED on the principle of &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;.  A one-world government is EXACTLY that and why globalism should be avoided at all costs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would just throw out the diversification principal of investing for OP to learn about and then apply to the concept of one world government. You may also consider the increasing cooperation and reliance on fewer and fewer mega providers for any necessary service. </p>

<p>What if all the corn in the world was grown only in the best corn growing region in the world? Smart right? But the risk profile goes waaay up. </p>

<p>So there are potential benefits if it is done well, but it significantly increases the risk profile of humans as a species. We all become susceptible to being hurled back to the stone ages by one devastating event that impacts a critical resource, one bad leader, one superbug, etc.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for more links! I devour this info, I&#39;m really thirsty for the truth and you seem to have a lot of knowledge on this subject. I knew nothing about conversos, for example, until you mentioned them. A few more pieces of the puzzle are coming together for me, especially regarding the East India Company.</p>

<p>I have a somewhat random question if you don&#39;t mind. This morning I was reading about Andriy Biletsky of Ukraine this morning, and either he or someone else in Azov claimed that Putin is a crypto Jew.</p>

<p>I had never really considered this, and always sort of thought that Putin was probably looking out for the best interests of ethnic Russians. But maybe not? And maybe globalist opposition to him is manufactured in order to give him credibility? Or maybe there are more than one faction of Jews vying for power? Or maybe that&#39;s all disinfo? What&#39;s your take?</p>
