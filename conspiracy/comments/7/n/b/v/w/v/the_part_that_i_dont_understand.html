        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Zionist/Khazarian cabal I know is probably the most powerful force within the shadowy, worldwide network of secret societies. You can see it with the news outlets, the CEOs of corporations, the banks, Israel’s lobby, Trump, etc; its all there. You can also see evidence of it in Kabbalah, which has influenced numerous world changing people, particularly those who kick started the New Age movement. </p>

<p>But what about the Nazis? What about the Chinese? The Russians are very much intangled with the Jewish problem, as they are the descendants <em>of the Khazars and Sarmatians</em> who converted to Judaism, becoming what we know as Ashkenazis, or “Fake Jews”</p>

<p>They are white. </p>

<p>One thought I have is that Christianity itself is a LARP committed by the Jews. If you know your history (I do) then you know that from about 60 BCE - 100 CE there was a serious flirtation between the Roman and Jewish cultures. Jerusalem was occupied, colonized, and finally sacked multiple times. An exchange of culture took place there, in addition to heavy Greek influence. </p>

<p>If this is true^ than it can be seen that the last few thousand years of history itself has been a LARP. Did Charlemagne really exist? Did the Dark Ages last for four or five hundred years? </p>

<p>As a history teacher, you have no idea how difficult it is, to teach this ridiculous, watered down, ultra-biased form of history we spew in public schools. </p>

<p>I do not think that Jews are just villains. I theorize that something occurred between evil Jews and evil Romans around the time of Christ that has led to history turning out the way it has. </p>

<p>Think about it, things could have been very different. </p>

<p>If Hannibal had managed to conquer Rome, than the Mediterranean world might still be worshipping Baal to this day, or, we might have made many scientific discoveries a lot sooner? Who knows!</p>

<p>But history, barring China and Japan which serve as a wild card, has followed a beaten path. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it certainly seems like the Christian Bible benefits Jews by calling them gods chosen people and what not. Christians certainly love jews and I assume think they are all going to be in heaven together.  Do christians love jews because jews LARPd them into loving them and doing their bidding?  Interesting theory OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christians support the jews because in the Bible, Jews are Gods chosen people.  I’ve always found it curious and have never found an explanation of why they are God’s chosen people.  Not one that could be explained to me in a fashion that made sense anyways. </p>

<p>It makes sense that it was added to the Bible considering Jews translated the Bible from Hebrew. It very well could have been added as a means of controlling the Christians. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please include me when you dive into this subject.</p>

<p>Abraham was friends with God.  Abraham was blessed and the 12 tribes are his descendants.  However not all of the 12 tribes stayed loyal to our Creator&#39;s word.</p>

<p>10 tribes were taken away to Assyria, and are lost to this day.  History does not know who they are.  </p>

<p>2 tribes stayed in Israel and were taken away by Babylon.  The history of these 2 tribes is what our entire &quot;The Jews&quot; is based around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the Northern Tribes of Israel were black, why is this not recorded in the &quot;Book of Gates&quot; which details the known races of the world?</p>

<p>Furthermore, what does this do to the Ethiopian Kingdom, widely regarded as having Torah followers for more than 2,300 years, as well as having a rich Rastafari heritage which draws its line from Queen Sheeba and King Solomon?  </p>

<p>Is your proposed heritage instead of the Rastafari line, or in parallel to it?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not familiar with the &quot;Book of Gates&quot; I see no reason for it not to be parallel but i will have to look into that.</p>

<p>As for Blacks being hebrews there are several mentions in the bible</p>

<p>Song of Solomon 1:5 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</p>

<p>Revelations 1: 14-15 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</p>

<p>15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.</p>

<p>When the Hebrews were persecuted they fled to Egypt because they could pass as the people of the nation.</p>

<p>Look at a map where Israel is located.</p>

<p>You have to look at also who funded the slave trade..The answer the Jews. as prophesied in Deuteronomy 28 that isreal would go into captivity again.  </p>

<p>The bible speaks about Israel losing who they are as a nation and the identity being stolen. Look at black history who are black people what is there heritage what are their customs, we are told that Africans sold other Africans into Slavery. That is not the case Africans sold Hebrews who took refuge into slavery.</p>

<p>Relevations also speaks about the Synaguage of Satan and those that claim there are jews but are not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the first image does nothing to show they didnt have dark skin, and for Miriam yes she was an Ethiopian but that was another nation seperate from the hebrews looking in the bible there are many verses against taking wives from other nations, but many have done it, examples, Moses, David, Samson fell inlove with Delilah, Solomon, and many more. Also Leprousy turns the skin white how many Hebrews had it, it is a curse upon the skin</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what scripture and historians say.  </p>

<p>compare paleo-hebrew writing to proto-celtic writing.  Super similar, and the time frames match up too.  </p>

<p>Josephus the famous Jewish Historian wrote in his book &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The entire body of the people of Israel remained in that country; wherefore there are but TWO TRIBES in Asia and Europe, subject to the Romans; while the TEN TRIBES are beyond the Euphrates till now and are an immense multitude not to be estimated by numbers.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ancient historian Kitto states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;After the captivity we hear very little of the territories of the Tribes for Ten of them NEVER RETURNED.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<p>Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only. (2 Kings 17:18)</p>

<p>and </p>

<p>Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD. (1 Kings 12:24)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This event took place during the reign of Rehoboam, son of Solomon, approximately two hundred years before Isaiah lived. To finance his massive building projects, Solomon had taxed the people heavily during his reign. Following his death, the ten northern tribes appealed for relief from the heavy tax burden, but Rehoboam refused. The Israelites returned home in rebellious anger. Rehoboam sent the head of that day&#39;s Internal Revenue Service to either collect some overdue revenues or negotiate. The Israelites assassinated him. Fearing the northern ten tribes&#39; secession, the Jews raised an army and prepared to go to war against their northern brethren. At that point, God directly intervened by sending a prophet to deliver the message contained in verse 24.</p>

<p>God says He was personally maneuvering events to bring about His will. <strong>He wanted to divide Israel and Judah into two separate kingdoms with two separate histories—a situation that exists to this day. Israel was later scattered in captivity by Assyria. Judah followed Israel into captivity over one hundred years later but at the hands of Babylon.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This journey took the Israelites through a narrow gap in the Caucasus called the Dariel Pass or the Pass of Israel to the land of Arsareth in the steppes of what is now Southern Russia. Their gravestones are there to this day and we read, example: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I am Jehudi, the son of Moses, the Son of Jehudi the Mighty, a man of the Tribe of Naphtali, carried captive with other tribes of Israel by Prince Shalmaneser... to Halah and Habor, to Gozan and to the Chersonesus.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another Crimean gravestone reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Zadock the Levite died 785 years after our exile.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prof. Chirolson of Petrograd deciphered over 700 of these epigraphs in the Crimea where Lost Israel passed through. Therefore science and scripture both say they migrated across Europe into these areas.</p>

<p>and </p>

<p>And nations have seen thy righteousness, And all kings thine honour, And He is giving to thee a new name, That the mouth of YHWH doth define. (Isaiah 62:2)</p>

<p>and </p>

<p>A perishing flock hath My people been, Their shepherds have caused them to err, To the mountains causing them to go back, From mountain unto hill they have gone, They have forgotten their crouching-place. (Jeremiah 50:6)</p>

<p>and </p>

<p>I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment. (Ezekiel 34:16)</p>

<p>and </p>

<p>But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. (Matthew 15:24)</p>

<p>Fascinating stuff </p>

<p>&quot;2:17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In regards to Charlemagne, have you heard of this hypothesis? Interesting stuff.</p>

<p>&quot;The phantom time hypothesis is a historical conspiracy theory asserted by Heribert Illig. First published in 1991, the hypothesis proposes a conspiracy by the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and possibly the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, to fabricate the Anno Domini dating system retrospectively, so that it placed them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history[1] to legitimize Otto&#39;s claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence.[2] According to this scenario, the entire Carolingian period, including the figure of Charlemagne, is a fabrication, with a &quot;phantom time&quot; of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the Early Middle Ages.&quot;</p>

<p>One thought I have is that Christianity itself is a LARP committed by the Jews. If you know your history (I do) then you know that from about 60 BCE - 100 CE there was a serious flirtation between the Roman and Jewish cultures. Jerusalem was occupied, colonized, and finally sacked multiple times. An exchange of culture took place there, in addition to heavy Greek influence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But why would the Jews propagate the engine of their own persecution in the form of Western Christianity? Their non-assimilation within Christian societies, and their non-acceptance of Christ, led to countless pogroms and massacres over hundreds of years, as well as being relegated to second class citizenry in multiple countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allow my to theorize. The Jews are not a homo-geneuos group we think they are. Abraham himself, the founder of the Israelites, was a Sumerian from the city of Ur, according to the Bible itself. </p>

<p>When the Israelites were enslaved into Egypt, they were included intolerant group of “Semites”</p>

<p>Many of the “Israelites” who escaped with Moses may have been from other tribes. There must be a reason that tribes such as the Moabites, Amorites, and Arameans were kept around so long despite their constant (possibly civil?) wars with Israel. </p>

<p>But I digress, when the city of Jerusalem was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar the Jewish elite were taken in captivity to Babylon where many of them would elect to stay for some thousand years long after they had been allowed by Cyrus or Alexander to leave. They learned the dark arts and that is where they wrote the Talmud. </p>

<p>At some point during this thousand year period a shift occurred. Jews of the Babylonian variety rejected god and turned to Satan. They went into Russia, back then called Khazaria and forced its people to turn to Jews. Those people them spread across Europe. </p>

<p>What I’m getting at is that most Jews aren’t Israelites. They’re just people who are the descendants of Russians or Europeans who were forcibly converted and have been used as human shields throughout the ages. </p>

<p>It’s quite tragic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would assume so, but how inbreeding has gone on? Also I think the term “true Jew” is in bad taste. I wouldn’t refer to anyone as a true Jew, I would only refer to someone who I know is a false Jew, like the Zionists. Even Ashkenazi or Russian Jews are I suppose “True Jews” they believe in their faith. </p>

<p>The only “false Jews” in my book are the ones who manipulate their people into acting as victims so that they can do the same to the Palestinians, and eventually the whole world, out of some false sense of superiority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;False Jews&quot; are all the Jews who weren&#39;t a part of the original Covenant with God, or any their direct descendants which is where their claim to the &quot;Chosen Ones&quot; that they still nevertheless claim to be happens to come from. A claim that is patently false as are any claims they make about the Holy Land being in any way promised <em>to them</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also a claim that the original Jews themselves forfeited by breaking that Covenant. The Holy Land was indeed given to them once upon a time and it was also taken away from them for failing to live up to their part of the bargain. For that they were to repent, make amends and bide their time until God would provide the means for them to return on His terms, not theirs.</p>

<p>The vast majority of Jews of today are the followers of the Scribes, Pharisees, and moneylenders that Christ quite rightly accused of deliberately twisting, distorting, and re-interpreting the words and laws of God <em>as they were given</em> strictly in order to suit themselves and referring to them as the children of Satan for their profligate lies and deceits. </p>

<p>Those are the Jews of the Talmud, not the Torah. The Jews who obey God&#39;s laws only insofar as comes to other Jews and not all men or mankind as was intended.</p>

<p>Jews who actually and secretly believe all non-Jews to be lesser life-forms created by God to be their abject slaves to do with as they please and with absolutely no regard for violating any or all the laws of God in when it comes to how they can and should really treat them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Hannibal had managed to conquer Rome, than the Mediterranean world might still be worshipping Baal to this day, or, we might have made many scientific discoveries a lot sooner? Who knows!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t give much credence to the idea that David and Joshua did most of the killing of the Baal worshippers?  </p>

<p>It seems to me that the romans continued their worship in their pantheon of Gods, including propping up polytheism.  Also how much do you know about the Iberian celtic population and their potential relationship with lost 10 tribes of Israel?  If that theory is true, it would paint the romans as aggressively persecuting the lost 10 tribes during their spanish campaign. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They control both sides. Albert Pike said it himself, they invented Christianity and Atheism so that when the time is right they would destroy both and make way for their “Anti-Christ” and their dark gods to return. </p>

<p>There’s an element of truth in it absolutely, and I’m the furthest thing from completely secular.</p>

<p>I practice ammalgamation of Christianity and Buddhism; I just take out the unnecessary parts. I think spirituality is important and essential to our being, it is religion that is the problem. </p>

<p>In Greek, religion means “to be tied up or chained” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might have one or more nice point concerned with William Guy Carr and a WWIII plan and a secular lead-up to a religious deception or something like that, but do you have a source where Albert Pike claims freemasons invented Christianity? Even if he did, what should we expect him to claim if Psalm 2:1-4 and Luke 4:5-6 are true? </p>

<p>I joined a freemason message board in 2005 or so and there was a guy who got coveted feedback from someone who seemed to be quite respected and the someone was asked about what he expected from the future and something was mentioned involving a revealing of the stewardship of the planet or something like that maybe. Can I ask where you stand in regards to Genesis 6:4 and the Book of Enoch?</p>
