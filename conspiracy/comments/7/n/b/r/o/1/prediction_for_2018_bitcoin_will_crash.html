        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As usual predictions usually fail it seems, and this one is speculative so it&#39;s just a hedge just in case. The prediction is that Bitcoin has on purpose been designed to crash in 2018, either through the cryptography it uses becomes broken or its proof of work algorithm will stop functioning.</p>

<p>The purpose for the crash is to destroy the chance of currencies emerging as a competition and threat to the fiat currencies.</p>

<p>Notice that the NSA has already moved away from the kind of cryptography Bitcoin uses:</p>

<p>&quot;The National Security Agency has long cuddled up to Elliptic Curve Cryptography, swaying standards bodies away from RSA crypto and toward ECC in the late 1990s, as well as recommending it as a strong enough solution for sensitive government agencies to use in guarding their biggest secrets.</p>

<p>In August, however, the NSA let it publicly slip, in relatively hushed tones, that it was divorcing itself from Suite B, a 20-year-old public crypto standard that relied on ECC and was certified for top secret data protection. The agency suggests concerns over advances in quantum computing as the reason for its about-face in support of Suite-B. ...</p>

<p>Cryptographers, however, aren’t buying that reasoning.&quot; -- <a href="https://threatpost.com/nsas-divorce-from-ecc-causing-crypto-hand-wringing/115150/">https://threatpost.com/nsas-divorce-from-ecc-causing-crypto-hand-wringing/115150/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world currency the article talks about is already here and has been here for years, Bitcoin. It&#39;s not only until recently the MSM have pushed the agenda that there is some value in it due to it&#39;s scarcity. It&#39;s going to take at least another generation before TBTP really ramp up their push for this sort of currency through the MSM. This push won&#39;t be until the most of the baby boomer generation have died and Gen X are at their stage in life baby boomers are at now, where their millennial generation children will have to start dealing with their finances because Gen X&#39;ers <strong>don&#39;t understand and don&#39;t really need to</strong>. That will be when the global one world currency will be pushed beyond comprehension. But that&#39;s just my theory about how this global currency will be implemented, it&#39;s going to take a few more years for businesses to accept bitcoin/global currency just like the whole world jumped on the Facebook train.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going with this theory then the internet would also have to be  almost 100% controlled.</p>

<p>Even if bitcoin is NWOcoin 1.0, there are other coins out there that are much more capable and useable. And if we don&#39;t like those, we could just create another. As long as we have freedom of communication you can&#39;t stop or controll all cryptocurrencies; the same way you can&#39;t stop people from sharing music.</p>

<p>If we have no free communication, we&#39;re way past worrying about the pros and cons of a global currency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately if they tell governments to enact laws making it so that you can only pay rent/water/electricity/groceries/healthcare/taxes in currency X, that&#39;s what will largely be used.

    <div class="md"><p>lets see, communism works. Unfortunately, lack of control breeds terrible marketplace. </p>

<p>Historically, nazis almost took the world, USSR post ww1 came out of a backwards country into dominating superpower that rivaled US right until 90s and that was post ww2 where everyone was beaten up and had to rebuild. CHina was doing terribly, then it got help (chineese cant do shi themselfs, we have direct proof because anything they make, cars for example, on their own were terrible, but they copy and replicate well), in 40 years they are they went from nothing, to now being dominating manufacturing beast and future holds more cards. NK despite years of oppression and economic sanctions are doing just fine, even developing ICBMs (probably with help). Entirety of europe with their strict controls have stable economies (even if they are still in shambles) with universal health care, and they actually jailed their bankers for bad shit following the housing bubble from US. </p>

<p>So no, total control works. Its the ethics of such is another matter (and as we know total control, means when evil arises it will be bad, once again stalin, hitler)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how people use cryptocurrency as a one world currency when we have had at least 3 to 6 different versions of a one world currency since we have been using money. One is rocks, second was silver, third was gold, fourth was gold backed paper, then silver backed paper, sixth was nothing backed fiat, seventh we have credit card but could be argued they have on some levels existed in the past just under a different name but same principles and now cryptocurrency. It is all an easier to use system than the others and the individuals that created cryptocurrency say that it will never totally replace gold, silver or cash  it&#39;s simply another version of a means of transaction. </p>

<p>And I think a lot of people out there misconstrued a crash with a correction all of these cryptocurrencies have gone up exponentially since the start of 2017.  And with as much of a run up as we have had there needs to be a good pullback that reflects a healthy market unlike wall street. Just remember this technology is neutral it is up to the person using the technology that determines is course in history be it weather good or bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the way I understand it, the bitcoin transactions themselves will never be hacked because all they do is display SHA256 hashes.  It is impossible to go from a hash to the original data because there&#39;s just no data there to re-form the original content.  On the other hand, all wallets rely on RSA256 encryption which can be theoretically cracked with massive brute force attacks.  If that&#39;s a problem then simply moving to a RSA512 encryption wallet will make everything safe.</p>

<p>As far as bitcoin crashing, yes, I agree.  But what do you consider &quot;crashing&quot;?  50% drop in value?  80% drop in value?  Or do you mean it will go to zero value?  Considering it skyrocketed over 4000% in 4 years, I don&#39;t think 50% fall in price is unreasonable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean ECC, not RSA I take it. &quot;secp256k1 refers to the parameters of the ECDSA curve used in Bitcoin&quot;</p>

<p>SHA-256 is used in the Bitcoin mining algorithm as a part of the proof of work (PoW). NIST has released SHA-3, but not as a replacement for SHA-2 (which includes SHA256):</p>

<p>&quot;SHA-3 is very different from SHA-2 in design,&quot; says NIST&#39;s Shu-jen Chang. &quot;It doesn&#39;t replace SHA-2, which has not shown any problem, but offers a backup. It takes years to develop a new standard, and we wanted to be prepared in case problems do occur.&quot; -- <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2015/08/nist-releases-sha-3-cryptographic-hash-standard">https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2015/08/nist-releases-sha-3-cryptographic-hash-standard</a></p>

<p>A speculative idea I have is that SHA256 although it has shown to be an excellent hash function may have limitations in terms of functioning as a random oracle. Take a recent Bitcoin block hash:</p>

<p>00000000000000000029a3d6ecec0ecbba1abee375d5bd559cf489fd775a7354 -- <a href="https://blockchain.info/blocks">https://blockchain.info/blocks</a></p>

<p>What happens if SHA256 is only able to produce a limited number of leading zeros like that? Then what will happen when the Bitcoin difficulty target exceeds that threshold the Bitcoin mining algorithm will stop functioning, because no miner will ever be able to find a valid block.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa, ok, your post is way too full of technical jargon for me to make sense of.  LOL.  Just a layman here.  </p>

<p>Maybe I should have made my reply clearer.  What I meant was that Proof of Work is based on a SHA256 hash.  No matter how powerful or smart computers get, you can&#39;t cheat PoW.  Sure, if you have a computer from 2300AD, you&#39;ll probably be able to show the proof of work faster than anyone else, thus monopolizing the bitcoin market.  But this doesn&#39;t compromise bitcoins.  It just makes you a better miner.  </p>

<p>What can be compromised are wallets.  All wallets rely on a variation of RSA256.  You have a public key and a private key.  The private key is what&#39;s important.  So if you have a computer that&#39;s capable of trying 2<sup>256</sup> keys in a reasonable time, the wallet is compromised.  </p>

<p>What my post was trying to say was that maybe the NSA is moving to a higher bit encryption system simply because we are close to building computers that can crack RSA256.  After all, remember RSA128?  Yeah, it was suppose to be secure forever.  LOL.</p>

<p>Anyway, like I said, I&#39;m just a neophyte when it comes to encryption so if I&#39;m wrong about a point, please let me know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it looks like its being fed, THere is a trend for the rise of value of bitcoin, and you can see near identical inflations. It looks far too similar of a trend, i feel, this gut feeling that they will feed it a few more times and on the uplex of another leap in value they will dump all thier stock causing a market crash. But that can only happen if &quot;they&quot; can control the exchange, because a fall in value caused a shutdown of exchange due to falling value. </p>

<p>I also like a theory someone proposed. When the quantum computer is up and running, or a set of them, encryption will be a thing of the past essentially. So someone who builds this, also shorts the bitcoin and then profits when it crashes. </p>
