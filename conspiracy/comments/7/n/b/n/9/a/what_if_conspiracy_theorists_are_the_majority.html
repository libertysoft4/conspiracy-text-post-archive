    <div class="md"><p>It just takes a small question, all innocent like to see whats up.  Some will get into it.</p>

<p>I know for a fact that most people actually are conspiracy theorists.  You can make statements as clear and obvious as anything and they know they have to agree.</p>

<p>&quot;There are zero criminals in Washington.&quot;  People will laugh, because of course it cannot be true.</p>

<p>&quot;People never kill to stay in power.&quot; Same thing, it is a given.  It has been done and there is no reason to stop now.</p>

<p>&quot;Those same people would never manipulate you or the public in order to keep the status quo.&quot;</p>

<p>Prime your target, show them with concrete evidence there is no need to give them credibility and show them people need to be more skeptical and hope them accountable.  If they can&#39;t or think that is impossible, ask them how you can ignore those actions and live in that world without being the watchdog of some kind?</p>

<p>If you get that far and say that&#39;s the way it is, they are the one&#39;s who have been beaten.  Apathy has taken them.  They&#39;re surviving, so......I call them unsavable.  </p>

As things flow here - on the internet - it&#39;s effectively a safe space where debunking is only grudgingly tolerated. Crazy stuff is OK. It gets downvoted or ignored and we move one.  </p>

<p>In a culture where conspiracy theories dominate, the admission of a problem can never occur because the discussion of what that problem is will be so split between individuals/factions or so thoroughly off-base on a society wide scale (&quot;Dumping trash in the lake isn&#39;t what has taken our drinking water from us, it&#39;s the &lt;insert minority&gt; who are poisoning it!&quot;) that when you&#39;re in the mindset you can barely grasp the concepts behind the true cause.</p>

Looks very much like him, but not the same.&quot; I asked if that&#39;s why he was in jail, and he affirmed that they didn&#39;t want him blabbing off that his friend was still alive and not a terrorist.</p>

<p>YES, people. Very much agree with OP. We gotta talk to each other out there.</p>

<p>Bro, Star Wars prequels came out before 911. The CG we saw on 911 was so low tech.</p>

<p>Do some research before concern trolling people who understand how it was really done.</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick - only bad magicians use CG. Want proof that CG footage was used?</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay so there was no CG at the pentagon because there wasnt even a fucking image released from them.</p>

<p>pentagon was a cruise missile, full stop, no need for CG there at all because no images were released.</p>

<p>as for the towers, saying there was no CGI doesnt mean there were no bombs, planes hit the structure and broke shit, i dont think the planes that did hit, actually brought the building down at all though.</p>

<p>you can hit the building with a plane and still bring it down with bombs. again zero reason for CGI, in fact because of the hole in the building there had to be something striking it. again the plane imho did not bring the building down, it was there for the appearance it did.</p>

<p>you seem to think CGI is a nessecity for what played out, im saying that the CG side theory is bunk because it is not required for any of the rest of it.</p>

<p>they ran a real plane in to the towers, but those planes were not responsible for the collapses. this CG theory is needlessly complicated and stupid. its easier to run a plane in to a building than it is to setup a fake hologram and rig charges to blow a plane shaped hole out of a building.</p>

<p>like i said this CG angle makes the rest look stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re right there was no CG for the Pentagon, because the Israelis didn&#39;t have access to the security camera footage (the WTC HD security camera footage they just went up to the rooftops on the nearby buildings and stole it.

    <div class="md"><p>again real planes would not have been shot down due to the confusion, fighters were not even in the air when the planes hit the towers. oddly enough if you bothered to read my link you would see that.</p>

<p>93 wasnt an aircraft either, it wasnt shot down (they claimed the passengers brought that one down remember) and again its &quot;crash site&quot; had no engines present or any of the debris associated with plane crashes.</p>

<p>no matter how hard/fast an aircraft slams in to anything the engine blocks survive. no engines were found at the 93 site or the pentagon, and they claimed they vaporized...</p>

<p>you say CG, well the reality is the planes were seen from a bunch of angles at the same time and by people with their own fucking eyes. so the only way to fake a plane that way is a hologram.</p>

<p>you seem to be stuck on this CG thing like its a make-or-break part of the theory. its not, they stand on their own, and the inclusion of this CG stuff as essential makes it looks silly.</p>

<p>if you are going to bring down the largest building in the city, its massively easier to use a real plane flown remotely as opposed to secretly editing all of the potential footage that would be easily discredited by a luck cellphone video.</p>

<p>there was zero possibility of the planes that hit the towers of being shot down due to the cluster fuck at NORAD. you seem more attached to the CG angle being a necessity than any other part of the story. </p>

<p>When planes are shot down the debri is scattered over large areas.</p>

<p>They did find an engine at Pentagon which was identified as a missile engine, according to a Major General. Did you read my post?</p>

<p>Lying according to who? The 911 commission?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The two co-chairs of the Commission, Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton, believe that the government established the Commission in a way that ensured that it would fail. In their book Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission describing their experience serving, Hamilton listed a number of reasons for reaching this conclusion, including: the late establishment of the Commission and the very short deadline imposed on its work; the insufficient funds (3 million dollars), initially allocated for conducting such an extensive investigation (later the Commission requested additional funds but received only a fraction of the funds requested and the chairs still felt hamstrung); the many politicians who opposed the establishment of the Commission; the continuing resistance and opposition to the work of the Commission by many politicians, particularly those who did not wish to be blamed for any of what happened; <strong>the deception of the Commission by various key government agencies, including the Department of Defense, NORAD and the FAA</strong>; and, the denial of access by various agencies to documents and witnesses. &quot;So there were all kinds of reasons we thought we were set up to fail.</p>

<p>&quot; a service-woman said to be..&quot; so an unconfirmed source....</p>

<p>No watch the actual video, you see they actually interview the Lt. Colonel, and she says:</p>

<p>&quot;There was a second airplane approaching the pentagon ... we discouraged anything happening there&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many conspiracies.  A conspiracy is in function as long as 2 or 3 gather together to do soemthing that is against a system, and organization,  group of people or individual. With all the proven corruptions that the United States government has done to its own citizens it would be foolish to think they havent done more or are still doing it. 
As a Christian who reads his Bible Daily, its also a duty of Christians to be skeptical on almost everything.  To desern from the good and bad. For if you just type tge words , conspire, conspiracy and conspired, into the Strong Concordance,  you will see how many times conspiracies have rose up to go against Gods people and or just good men and women. We has humans have a low tolerance of patience and self esteem. If we feel threatened we try to find people who think like us to surround us and make us more comfortable. We all have conspired in something at one part of our lives whether it was small or big , good or bad. That is why again anyone who doesnt believe in conspiracies ever is trully the dumb shit for brains who is blind and deaf to reality in general. </p>
