        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last year something unbelievable happened. I [20M] was in the passenger seat of a car being driven by a girl [19F] who I was talking to at the time. My best friend [18M] was in the back seat, right behind me. We were driving around the local blunt roads, but little did we know that a very sketchy incident was to come our way. As we&#39;re driving through an intersection, me and my best friend look to our right to see a large 2017 Chevy Silverado flying towards us. In this moment, everything felt slow motion. Me and my friend look at each other with fear (and acceptance), and basically just braced for impact. The weird thing is, the truck driver seemed to speed up as he got closer to us. It would have been a perfect T-bone, but luckily, the girl driving us floored it at the last second. Me and my friend would have both been dead.  The truck was going about 40-50 mph, and slammed into the back-passenger side of the car where the rear wheel was. We spun out a few times and ended up about 25 meters up the road. The impact was unreal. But this is where the story starts to get sketchy. As soon as I got out of the car to go check on the truck driver, there was already a crowd of people standing around the truck. At least 10-15 people. Where these people came from.. I don&#39;t know. There were no cars around, and only a couple houses close by. I hid all the weed, and as soon as I was about to make my way towards the truck, a man from the crowd runs up to me. He said something along the lines of &quot;he&#39;s hurt,he&#39;s hurt!&quot;. This made absolutely no sense to me, considering the truck hit US, and appeared to have no damage. Mind you, we were driving a tiny little Hyundai, so why wasn&#39;t there a bunch of people checking up on us? When I get to the crowd, I start to ask people if he&#39;s okay. But no one will even look at me. Weird, huh? I raised my voice since no one would answer, and finally, a man says to me very rudely &quot;NO, HE&#39;S NOT OKAY!&quot; Another woman said &quot;He hit his head really hard&quot;. This frightened me, but then I looked in the truck to see a middle aged man putting on the worst act I have ever seen. Worse than any reality TV show. He was bobbing his head around trying to look dizzy, and he was pretending he could barely breathe.  It was comical to me and I didn&#39;t understand how people were even taking him seriously. I was so confused. At this point, my girl and my friend were still at the Hyundai, trying to relax and get their blood pressure back to where it should be. I went up to them and told them that nothing was making sense. A few minutes later, some cops and an ambulance showed up. As the cops were getting information from us, I look down the road to see the ambulance drive away.... without the &quot;injured&quot; man. The motherfucker then drives off like nothing even happened, and all the people vanished (I have no clue where they went). The cops left soon after and we were alone once again, confused and angered about the situation.  We had so many questions, but no one could answer them. Was someone trying to kill us? Where the hell did the people come from? Why did no one check on us? Why did they let the guy who apparently couldn&#39;t see or breathe drive away? To this day, me and my friend still wonder. We&#39;ve weighed out all the possibilities, but it remains a mystery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s extremely odd.  Was there no accident report from the cops?  no names or insurance information provided to you?  Was the man charged with anything?  Who was at fault?<br/>
So many questions, is there any answers?  As for all of the people that just showed up and disappeared, they are probable witnesses.  If there&#39;s no accident report etc and you have visible damage you should definitely contact a lawyer if this guy wasn&#39;t charged.   Maybe you suffered a concussion and some of your memory isn&#39;t accurate.   I really don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take back the Satanist nametag, let&#39;s face it there are a blend of bizarre reasons and Entities that a ritual seeking group would pull.
Could be a plain old hit job, too...but the attention on the driver and overly emotional response: &quot;He&#39;s Hurt&quot;, suggests attachment to 
&quot;Him&quot;. 
There is also a technique known as a School Play scenarios, which is exactly as it sounds
(poor acting) that covers hits as well.
When Sociopaths release their Psychos onto people, they often must accompany there feral human...to keep it &quot;listening&quot; and fixating.
Don&#39;t Panic
Psychotics aren&#39;t ever as killy as Sociopaths would like!</p>

<p>My first instinct is to say your memory of the event is wrong since you were just in a car crash and would be very disoriented and confused, but the car was wrecked right? So what happened to it and the insurance claim? </p>
