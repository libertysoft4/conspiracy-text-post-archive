    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard that the gossip in Hong Kong was that he died of an illegal drug overdose while with his mistress. They covered it up to save face (and legacy).</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t found any real evidence to support this, but at the same time, I think it&#39;s strange that one never hears this scenario proposed. The explanations are always accidental or insidious - both of which preserve Bruce Lee&#39;s legend. If he died of misadventure however...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s several theories. Another one is when Bruce partnered with Warner Bros, the Chinese film execs put a hit out on him. There were also silly theories like he died from an iron palm technique, but there was so much mystique around east asian martial arts that many people believe it. Joey Diaz just went in. A conspiracy theory podcast called Tin Foil hat about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah Joey is terrible for this type of podcast, great for cocaine stories and eating edible pot, but not well suited for talking about one set idea and elaborating on it. It&#39;s sad because his ability to recall dates, times, and locations of events 40 years ago is impeccable and would probably make the best conspiracy researcher ever. However he uses that brain power to remember snorting coke out of a strippers ass on December 16,1984 at 3:10am in a motel 8 in North Bergen,NJ</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many theories out there. I can’t get enough info on it to say either way for me. But as I look more into the entertainment industry I find it odd that I don’t feel educated, inspired or enlightened from movies like I did from Bruce Lee’s films. He spread his message and his ideas so well and had very little budget to do so. They were cult classics. I wouldn’t be surprised if the powers that be didn’t like the fame, attention and control he was getting. Just speculation on my part. But yeah. An interesting topic </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard that he used to smoke opium to relax, a habit he picked up from his father who was a rockstar-like thespian in the Honk Kong opera. He was having headaches and went to the doc who said it was because was allergic to opium and was advised to not smoke anymore, especially with his training regiment being so strenuous. Not tylenol, opium.  I recall a documentary where Linda Lee actually says it, but haven&#39;t been able to find it. </p>
