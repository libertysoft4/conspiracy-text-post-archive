        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Interesting article from Al-Jazeera includes this small statement. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/protests-iran-171231083620343.html">http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/protests-iran-171231083620343.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;Meanwhile, Habibollah Khojastepour, security deputy of the governor of Lorestan province, said on Sunday that the presence of &quot;agitators&quot; prevented a peaceful end to the protest, according to Mehr news agency. </p>

<p>He also blamed &quot;foreign agents&quot; for the deaths of the two protesters, saying that security forces did not fire on the crowd.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, it&#39;s impossible to know with any certainty who fired the shots at this time. We may end up seeing footage on social media proving that Iranian security forces did in fact fire on the protestors. (Once social media is possible again...in Iran...definitely a check mark in the &quot;against&quot; column concerning Iran&#39;s government)</p>

<p>I&#39;m just pointing out the &quot;possibility&quot; that snipers from another country who have a huge interest in seeing the government of Iran overthrown could be playing a part in the chaos.</p>

<p>If someone could link the stories about &quot;unknown snipers&quot; I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks u/Balthanos</p>

<p>Adding this comment from u/KiwiBattleNZ to post..the man in the crowd firing does so at the 25 second mark...I believe it&#39;s the 3rd video in the article.</p>

<p>Great place and time to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2573923/Estonian-Foreign-Ministry-confirms-authenticity-leaked-phone-call-discussing-Kiev-snipers-shot-protesters-possibly-hired-Ukraines-new-leaders.html">remind everyone</a> that the shooters (snipers) in Maidan (Ukraine) were actually <em>not</em> from the government, but from the US-backed opposition that took power after the coup. We wouldn’t know if it wasn’t for a leaked phone call between the Estonian FM and Catherine Ashton.</p>

<p>Here is a case btw where I’ll readily accept the information was leaked by the Russians. But insofar as it’s the truth, I’ll gladly accept it (when authoritarian propagandists rely on the truth to further their agenda you know the opposite side is quite the evil one).</p>

<p>In the video you see a man carrying a pistol raise the weapon in the air and fire two shots while standing in the middle of a crowd of apparently unarmed protesters.</p>

<p>This is another way they get police/security forces to fire on crowds. This definitely happened in Ukraine, with plenty of footage showing armed men mingling with unarmed protesters firing shots at police.</p>

<p>It may very well be that the police fired on the protesters, but that still doesn&#39;t mean that it was unjustified and unprovoked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great place and time to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2573923/Estonian-Foreign-Ministry-confirms-authenticity-leaked-phone-call-discussing-Kiev-snipers-shot-protesters-possibly-hired-Ukraines-new-leaders.html">remind everyone</a> that the shooters (snipers) in Maidan (Ukraine) were actually <em>not</em> from the government, but from the US-backed opposition that took power after the coup. We wouldn’t know if it wasn’t for a leaked phone call between the Estonian FM and Catherine Ashton.</p>

<p>Here is a case btw where I’ll readily accept the information was leaked by the Russians. But insofar as it’s the truth, I’ll gladly accept it (when authoritarian propagandists rely on the truth to further their agenda you know the opposite side is quite the evil one).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here&#39;s a few posts from my bookmarks about various instances of mystery snipers. Ever since this Iran business began I&#39;ve just been waiting for the rooftop snipers. Wish I had saved more links, I know I really went looking for these a while back, but oh well, I still have a few.</p>
