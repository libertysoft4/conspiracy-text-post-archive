Some funny things I&#39;ve noticed.   First, I didn&#39;t get even close in metal value to what the market price is and the market price is higher than it was then.  That was interesting.  Secondly, the places to sell it here require ID.   And not just any ID but something that has your address on it.  So first place I went to I didn&#39;t have ID on me and I walked back to get my passport, and second place I went to (to compare prices) wouldn&#39;t even take that.  This is in York Region, Ontario, Canada notorious mob hotspot.  Apparently it&#39;s a bylaw here.  So, no exchange today.  What&#39;s funny is that they need your address, and they take your picture.  It&#39;s as if they&#39;re profiling people to shake down.  Fascinating and not at all surprising.  </p>

<p>yeah this is a setup though.  it prevents people from buying/selling without official approval.  that would be acceptable if society was constructed in a way where there wasn&#39;t scarcity.  but as it currently stands, it&#39;s too authoritarian for me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Buddy, gold &quot;collector&#39;s&quot; coins peddled by the likes of Alex Jones and Glenn Beck are a scam. Alex Jones is a complete snake oil salesman charlatan. Hell, did we already forget Beck being caught in his scam? It doesn&#39;t matter if some 1933 eagle gold coin was the hottest thinkfor collectors when you purchased your marked up pieces under the assurance that gold never goes down in the long run. You purchased a collectable piece. The ideal for collectors changes. Quite often. You might as well by some Alex Jones endorsed baseball cards. It&#39;s pretty much the same idea. If you want invest in precious metals, invest in them on the markets. But, i ask you to consider two things when throwing your hard earned money into gold as a way to protect yourself from the economic sky that you believe is falling, 1) Is the person trying to sell you gold to protect you from the collapsing economy also the same person telling you that the economy is collapsing? and 2) If the economy does collapse into ruin, can you eat and drink that g</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You wrote a post about how you bought some gold coins off of infowars and when you tried to sell them you were unable to find someone to purchase them at a price satisfactory to whqt you thought you should be getting.Your title even highly suggests you think investing in precious metals is a scam. Myself and others alerted you to the fact that these gold coins being hawked to listeners of right wing radio hosts were pretty often, if not always, scams. I even went further to say that if someone trying to sell you something to protect yourself from the sky falling is the same person trying to convince you that the sky is falling, be wary! You replied that you didn&#39;t buy the coins to invest, but as safety in case a &quot;grid down&quot; aka &quot;the sky is falling&quot; situation happened and you only wanted what would be adequate in that situation. I asked why you would care if you couldn&#39;t get current market value then if what you were offered was adequate for a &quot;grid down&quot; situation. And now we are here so I ask, how did I distort what you are saying? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>calm down, chief. The fact that you started off your post going on about not getting market rate made me think that was a large reason for your post. My bad that I didn&#39;t realize your real post was about buyers wanted your contact info before buying, out of good faith, some coins you have most likely never had tested for purity. I didn&#39;t realize in that situation it made the consumer a fascist. My apologies. You know what, friend, you go buy whatever Jones tells you to buy. Someone will be very happy with the sale.</p>
