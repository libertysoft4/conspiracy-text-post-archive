        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This forced duality is a big fucking joke that needs to be exposed. So many people are caught in this little psychological trap that the left right dichotomy has created, and if we could break free of it, we could accelerate our awakening tenfold. </p>

<p>There are two sides: Those who are drawn in by the charm and the attitude, the &quot;character&quot; of the president, and those who pay attention to his policies and reject to his authoritarian style of ruling. </p>

<p>The people drawn in by the charm, are usually completely unaware of <em>anything</em> he has done, it&#39;s just blind support for someone that seems like a genuinely presidential figure to them. They have an almost &quot;cult-like&quot; attitude about their leader.</p>

<p>The people who reject the president for his actions, although perceptive, are often extremists and portrayed as outlandish. Therefore, when they voice their concerns over the authoritarian actions of the president, the other side can&#39;t possibly fathom why they would dislike their charming leader. This is a ploy to breed tension between the two sides. </p>

<p>Both sides are usually blinded by partisan devotion. Anti Obama folks called the dude a &quot;Muslim&quot; and were often seen as racist hillbillies, and pro Obama folks were seen as &quot;libtards&quot; and saw any criticism of their president as either racist or inhuman for rejecting his &quot;character&quot;. Inversely, anyone supportive of Trump is seen as racist, and I found that interesting how they often use racism as a way of demonizing one particular side.  </p>

<p>This breeds not only animosity/tension among the public, but it also keeps any <em>real</em> awakening to the truth in the middle; <strong>The president is just a puppet that the elites have selected to do their bitch work. He/she is literally playing a character, and has no autonomy at the position. Divorce yourself from the political theatrics and focus on exposing the conspiracy to establish a global government.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I&#39;m well aware of that. And actually, I&#39;ve been calling that out since before the election to my colleagues/friends. They will prop him up and give him positive PR to conspiracy theorists too.</p>

<p>They want to merge the conspiracy community with partisan right politics and pro trump support, the render is useless.</p>

<p>I saw this once Alex jones and cernovich and Paul Joseph Watson all started cheerleading for trump in unison during the election. These are guys who used to call out the two party system and fake elections.  All I could think was &quot;what the fuck are they up to now?&quot; </p>

Interestingly enough, he got divorced and embroiled in a nasty custody battle with his ex.  I can&#39;t help but wonder if this didn&#39;t play in to his transformation?    Some say he&#39;s been controlled opposition all along?  Who knows?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your post above, you railed against the NWO globalist agenda of having a one world government.  Hillary is a NWO globalist.  She is associated with the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations.  She is also associated with the Occult.   </p>

<p>Trump is not.  Doesn&#39;t it make sense to you that the American voters would support a candidate who is not a NWO globalist?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. There appears to be more evidence that Hilary is associated with the NWO and the occult than Trump.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t come across any evidence that supports the idea that Trump is associated with the NWO and the occult. Would like to see if anyone has some?</p>

<p>The idea that all presidents are &quot;controlled&quot; by the powers that be is, imo, fairly accurate going back to Wilson in 1913 (b/c Federal Reserve Act) and every president since. Now the thought that Trump isn&#39;t apart of the NWO and the occult and is actively fighting against these evil fucks is welcomed. But is there any truth in this? Is he actually fighting against the powers that be or is he simply a puppet? The reason people eat up the idea (trump fighting the PTB) at every chance and at every single post/article/video (on reddit, 4 chan, etc) is b/c this gives people hope. It gives me hope. As much as I don&#39;t like trump. This idea that someone in a position of power is actually using that power to help the people and not to further some sinister agenda is uplifting and inspiring. It feels good to think this thought.</p>

<p>One minor note: just because someone is a CEO of a wall street bank or a board member for xyz company doesn&#39;t automatically make them a bad person with nefarious intentions. Stop fucking making it seem like every CEO is tied to some conspiracy. There certainly are bad people with horrible intentions that got placed in a top position. But people who rise to the top of companies and hold positions of power are usually, USUALLY, the most competent people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been asking for that evidence for over a year now.  Trump&#39;s father was a Freemason, but that does not mean that Trump is.   Trump is associated with the Rothschild banker Wilbur Ross, who is a part of the Trump administration.   Other than that, I know of nothing.   </p>

<p>Bill Clinton is connected with Bilderberg, and Hillary is on video sucking off the Council on Foreign Relations.   I can find it if you have not seen it.   </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s stance on pedophilia and human trafficking tells me he is not a Satanist or Luciferian.   </p>

<p>I agree with your third paragraph.  Lincoln and JFK stood up to the bankers, but the bankers got America in amstranglehold in 1913.   Wilson betrayed us.   Trump gives us more hope than Hillary.  That&#39;s for sure.  I have told people that Trump can do good, or he can make his own noose.   So far, Trump appears to be fighting more than any other President since Carter.   </p>

<p>As for your last paragraph, are you calling me a faggot?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say that.  Is there some bot presence?  Yes.  But the &quot;left&quot; is should not be casting any stones in that regard.  There is a reason why Trump swept the electoral college and was very close to Hillary in vote count, and it wasn&#39;t because of one loud as fuck subreddit screaming &quot;MAGA.&quot;  Also, the RNC doesn&#39;t have groups of people correcting the record on social media sites.  </p>

<p>And please tell me how the RNC suppressed votes.  Did they have bullies posted in front of polling sites to harass any democratic voters?  Are they intentionally giving out false info of voting booth locations like what the DNC did during the primaries?  Is requiring an ID to vote to prove you are a citizen considered voter suppression?  Christ.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, for the most part. That said, the president could have power(s) via the organic constitution, he would just need to the full backing of the military and it would be a slippery slope into tyrannical dictatorship. I think this is why many people who support Trump truly hope he&#39;s is an outsider.</p>

<p>Both sides are usually blinded by partisan devotion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a facet of Cognitive Dissonance. Once most people have made up their mind about something they will defend it like crazy, regardless of evidence. Wether it&#39;s politics, religion, celebrities etc, it doesn&#39;t matter. Most people have been guilty of it at some time in their life. We can only hope that more and more people will wake up and smell the bullshit.</p>

<p>A quote on Cognitive Dissonance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The more committed we are to a certain opinion, the less likely we are to relinquish it, even if confronted with massive contradictory evidence. (Does the phrase &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; ring a bell?)  The theory of cognitive dissonance, originally developed by psychologist Leon Festinger, deals precisely with those feelings of discomfort that people experience when presented with information that is inconsistent with their beliefs.  Multiple studies show that to relive cognitive dissonance, in many cases, in stead of acknowledging an error in judgment, people tend for reformulate their views in a new way that justifies their old &gt;
opinions.</p>

<p>However, where we go after that is a lot of confusion, and because no one knows how to think, likely results in blood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course not. I have a habit of being sensational. But we&#39;ve been at this &quot;informing&quot; stage for a long time. I&#39;m not even an old man and it seems endless...</p>

<p>Transitioning to a life of self sufficiency is the start. If you can&#39;t afford where you live, move. If you have a family, you being the man, there is no alternative. That is grass roots.</p>

<p>If you can afford where you live, and can transition, do so. Being complacent and paying in to the scheme only makes you an accomplice and just as guilty.</p>

<p>If you have no kids, or even those young enough to still impression, do the right thing and raise them without outside help, or at least of your own ideology more than not, and by that I mean the truth. Work your 8 and make sure you give proper audience. Without the parents children are left seeking answers elsewhere, and that is from what is fought against.</p>

<p>This, that stage, is ever more present and I do not believe it is long before there will be scuffles to get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, this concept needs to be remedied. I&#39;m hoping a 3rd and 4th party become viable soon (unlikely). </p>

<p>I&#39;m a moderate. I think both sides have some good ideas and some bad, but the second I claim that an idea by democrats is good I&#39;m instantly labeled a liberal, communist, socialist etc... Same on the other side, if I claim that a republican idea is good, I&#39;m instantly a bigot, a racist, conservative Bible buster lol.</p>

<p>I like to think for myself... A mixture of ideas from both parties is most likely the right answer.</p>

<p>One thing I can say is that no matter what, the rich, powerful, and elite of this country always win. We are all down here fighting for scraps and blaming each other for our woes, while the rich and powerful are sitting back w their popcorn enjoying because it doesn&#39;t matter which party is in power,both parties cater to the elite.</p>

<p>In many ways, the powerful people in this country are to blame for the divisiveness among the lower and middle class. They probably orchestrate much of the divisiveness. At the very least, they inadvertantly cause it and propagate it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t like this post enough. You speak the truth when you say &quot;In many ways, the powerful people in this country are to blame for the divisiveness among the lower and middle class. They probably orchestrate much of the divisiveness. At the very least, they inadvertantly cause it and propagate it.&quot; And I like this next quote. &quot;A mixture of ideas from both parties is most likely the right answer.&quot; I agree with this opinion. </p>

<p>What does it take to make a 3rd and 4th party viable? They aren&#39;t viable now because they get shit coverage and bias from the fucking media that &quot;reports&quot; &quot;news&quot; &quot;about&quot; &quot;political&quot; &quot;elections.&quot; And another reason, may be related to the first one, is that people don&#39;t fucking vote for the 3rd/4th parties. Most people have heard that you&#39;re &quot;wasting&quot; your vote if you vote 3/4 party. The name itself is even meaningful. Why would you vote 4th party when you could vote 1st party? One thing is for sure: we need a few more parties to choose from because the current &quot;two&quot; fuck us over on the reg. Not all of them, but there is allegedly a group. As a Conspiracy subreddit how valuable and revealing would it be to create our own party which has actual benefit for humanity based off of nuanced principals? Seriously. It would probably be fucked up. But I would like to see what R/conspiracy could come up with, as if creating a new political party.  </p>

Bush Sr. likewise was treated as a respected head of state, not subjected to the kinds of attacks that came against the next president, Bill Clinton.  </p>

<p>As for Bush Jr, by and large, were his detractors wrong?  </p>

<p>Is hating Bush for how that election went down and then suspecting him (rightly as we now know) of lying the county into a war anything remotely like thinking the president is a secret Kenyan Muslim?  These are not the same things at all.  Not even close.  </p>

<p>Obama was a pretty ordinary president in his conduct and moderate and centrist in his policy yet his treatment was unprecedented and unlike even that directed at Bush Jr, yet also unlike that direct at W. it was so without substance or any real cause, they were resorting to Birtherism as their &quot;big gun&quot;.   </p>

<p>As for Trump, he led chants of &quot;lock her up&quot; about his opponent.  Is that normal in US elections or are the people who are shocked and disgusted to see that at a campaign rally the ones acting more consistently with US norms?  </p>

<p>The man stood on stage and insinuated his opponent should be assassinated if she won.  By default, pre-Trump, if this conduct was described without partisan identifiers, do you think most Americans would deem it remotely acceptable in a presidential candidate?   </p>

<p>Given his conduct, who is responding consistently with long standing American norms and who is radically departing from them?  The people who despise the candidate that insinuated at his rally that his opponent should be assassinated or the people who saw that and thought he was fit to president?  </p>

<p>This both sides bullshit is just denying reality.  Bush Jr. was the first Republican president since Nixon to be objected so strongly to and they weren&#39;t wrong about Nixon either.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, outside the US, everyone in the mainstream, left and right in other English speaking Western democracies, by and large treated Reagan, Bush Sr, Clinton and Obama like respectable presidents.  Bush Jr. was internationally controversial unlike any US president since Nixon, and negative reactions to Trump are pretty much the consensus.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a stable pattern; Clinton&#39;s treatment was less unjustified than Obama&#39;s yet significantly less intense, irrational and off the rails.  Bush Jr. was a really bad president, he is compared favorably to Trump.  This isn&#39;t cycling back and forth in a loop; it&#39;s spiraling out of control, and it&#39;s not both sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it doesn&#39;t &quot;scream,&quot; but it whispers. One must dig deeper. </p>

<p>What&#39;s going on is subtle, barely beneath the surface, so to avoid civil war. We are in a precarious time.</p>

<p>Easy example: he stopped the TPP.</p>

<p>Another example is human-trafficking. Look at the number of arrests since last year and compare to Obama years. Trump declared January to be human trafficking awareness month.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not the best source, but Robert David Steele on YouTube has accurate info. He&#39;s not a big Trump supporter either, but he&#39;s ex-CIA so there&#39;s that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this were an accurate argument, then there has been voter suppression done on both sides, from the second article itself:  &quot;The cleansing of America’s voter registration rolls occurs every two years and has become a legal battleground between politicians who say the purges are fair and necessary, and voting rights advocates who contend that they discriminate.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there was voter suppression or manipulation any more than &quot;normal&quot;.  Trump won because voters are hoping he was legit in his apparent disdain for the &quot;swamp&quot;.</p>
