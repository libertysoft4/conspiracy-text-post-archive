    <div class="md"><p>In general, what I have gathered from hanging around here over the years is that very few people believe that it&#39;s literally all fake. Most people you would be talking to here question details and motives due to the possibility that information was twisted over time through propaganda.  </p>

<p>For example, Stalin killed more people than Hitler, but most people don&#39;t refer to his war machine as a Holocaust in the same way even though millions died in concentration camps.  </p>

<p>Of course you&#39;ll find people who make extreme claims that it never happened, but I have a hard time taking that seriously because it&#39;s obvious that <em>something</em> happened.</p>

Promise ppl a home and land if they achieve it, especially after their homeland is still war-torn/ soviet occupied, you&#39;ll get em.  I say Rothschilds cuz they financed it in the begining, then made their hexagram the national symbol besides all the cries to make it the menorah. And 20 years after they illegally got nukes.

<blockquote>
<p>After 1945 the name was applied to the displaced persons camp established nearby, but it is most commonly associated with the concentration camp. From 1941 to 1945, almost 20,000 Soviet prisoners of war and a further 50,000 inmates died there.[3] Overcrowding, lack of food and poor sanitary conditions caused outbreaks of typhus, tuberculosis, typhoid fever and dysentery, leading to the deaths of more than 35,000 people in the first few months of 1945, shortly before and after the liberation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>personally i think the theory that they were work camps and that most of the starvation/disease was actually a consequence of the allies bombing supply routes.</p>

<p>the work camps were horrendous, and i dont think the necessarily knew the supply routes they were bombing supplied prisoners. but when they showed up and realized they were prison labour they had to spin the story to make them not look like the bad guys.</p>

<p>not to mention all the logical flaws in the idea these were expressly to exterminate people. it doesnt make sense to ship people all over the country by train to kill them when it would have been easier to just shoot them and bury them in each town they cleansed.</p>

<p>imho this line of logic makes even more sense when you read some of the insane and fantastical accounts of some of the survivors. my favourite being the roller coaster to the incinerator.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Stalin killed more people than Hitler&quot; </p>

<p>but this is a good example of potential US propaganda... &quot;millions died in concentration camps&quot; under Stalin? <em>what?</em> where does this come from?</p>

<p>the largest death toll under Stalin would be the famine in Ukraine. Commonly accepted numbers for both events still put the Holocaust at 7-10million more people.</p>

<p>Of course if you want to question those numbers, fine, but you naturally should then question the Holodomor&#39;s death toll too. </p>

<p>no, Stalin being an &quot;ally&quot; of the US for a short period is not gonna prevent the US from turning on him later. as we very well know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that it is clear <em>something</em> happened, although I personally do not believe in the most commonly trotted out story of the &quot;Final Solution&quot;. It is evident to me that it is likely that Typhus likely killed most of the people in these camps, likely along with starvation (especially towards the end of the war) and malnutrition. It simply does not make sense to me as to why the Nazis, who had wanted to move the Jewish people (and other &quot;undesirables&quot;) to Madagascar, would gas people that could have worked. I could believe them killing those that couldn&#39;t work, but I do not believe gassing could have killed millions within 1-2 years as the war looked grim for the Nazis, and they would begin to start prioritizing the soldiers. Along with this, Zyklon B, the agent that was apparently used to gas the Jews, is a delousing agent, and not a gassing one.</p>

<p><strong>(tl;dr)</strong> Many died, sure, but not of gassing. Conditions were deplorable, but likely not much worse than the concentration camps we had here in the U.S.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;At the trial, Dönitz was charged with:[27]</p>

<p>Waging unrestricted submarine warfare against neutral shipping
Permitting Hitler&#39;s Commando Order of 18 October 1942 to remain in full force when he became commander-in-chief of the Navy, and to that extent responsibility for that crime (his defence was that the order excluded men captured in naval warfare, and that the order had not been acted upon by any men under his command).
Knowing that 12,000 involuntary foreign workers were working in the shipyards, and doing nothing to stop it.
Advice in 1945 when Hitler asked Dönitz whether the Geneva Convention should be denounced. Hitler&#39;s motives were twofold. The first was that reprisals could be taken against Western Allied prisoners of war; second, it would deter German forces from surrendering to the Western Allies (as was happening on the Eastern Front where the Geneva Convention was in abeyance). Instead of arguing the conventions should never be denounced, Dönitz suggested it was not expedient to do so, so the court found against him on this issue; but as the Convention was not denounced by Germany, and British prisoners in camps under Dönitz&#39;s jurisdiction were treated strictly according to the Convention, the Court considered these mitigating circumstances.&quot; Wikipedia </p>

<p><em>Otherwise however, Dönitz&#39;s policies chiefly demonstrated continuity with the previous regime. The Nazi party was neither banned nor dissolved. Dönitz kept a bust of Hitler in his office; and the uniforms, insignia and protocol of the Third Reich were maintained, initially including even the &#39;Heil Hitler&#39; greeting. Following a plea from Speer, Dönitz on 2 May rescinded the infamous &#39;Nero Decree&#39; ordering scorched earth destruction of German infrastructure and industrial plant; but it was not until 6 May that counterpart destruction orders were rescinded for those territories, such as Norway, remaining under German occupation. Moreover, neither summary courts for civil punishment, nor military discipline by summary courts martial were abolished; with military executions for insulting the memory of Hitler being confirmed even after the final capitulation on 8 May.</em></p>

<p>It was obvious even to some committed Nazis that Hitler was a genocidal maniac by at least 43. Donitz was such a true believer that he was there to the end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some basic responses:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its illegal to question the official story in most of europe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Europe has very strict speech laws, for obvious reasons, you know, like propaganda being used to murder millions of people of all stripes). For example, a German comedian got in trouble for criticizing Erdogan in a lewd manner. In the US, it&#39;s easy to criticize that (it does offend my sensibilities about free speech), but it&#39;s their government. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6hmermann_affair">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6hmermann_affair</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Ever changing # of Death&#39;s</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is history. It&#39;s never clean-cut. We have inaccurate or varied numbers for all kinds of events from ancient history through the present, but we know they happened. Gee, an ethnic group that was routinely put outside of legal protection, had pogroms against them, etc, didn&#39;t have accurate census numbers. That&#39;s not shocking. They were also crimes, the Nazis weren&#39;t going to broadcast to the world that they were mass murderers; of course we don&#39;t have good numbers.</p>

<p>What does it matter? Aside from admissions over the years, we know what Hitler wanted to do, it&#39;s in <em>Mein Kampf</em>. He hated Jews, exterminating them from Germany is exactly what he would have done and we know targeted campaigns happened against them. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babi_Yar">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babi_Yar</a></p>

<p>If 600k died, it&#39;s still crime against humanity, like all other genocides. It doesn&#39;t eliminate the crime or the horror. The downplaying of numbers is one of the strangest tactics of deniers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Rothschilds &amp; Grandaddy bush Funded them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you had to deny historical events because they were connected to people with money or the Bushes, you&#39;d have to deny most of modern history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our History books are being manipulated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>History is always written with a slant, that&#39;s why it is important to get multiple sources. The weight of modern scholarship and a variety of sources are in the Holocaust-did-happen camp, the Holocaust deniers are often from a very fringe or intellectual inbred group. Holocaust deniers come from the same brilliant historical research community as those who thought that the KKK was a noble organization. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its used as a shield to protect Jews from any Criticism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and it shouldn&#39;t be, but the victims are still victims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It lead to the Creation of Israel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is undoubtedly true, but again, victims are still victims, regardless of the results of tragedy.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Insane amount of money Corporate has made from it</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Corporations make money off everything.</p>

<p>When you really get down to it, what it comes to is that Jews became popular in Christian and Islamic societies because they were allows to do things the other groups would not. This included being merchants and financiers and made some of them very wealthy. This had natural results of envy, but it also did not help that Jews did not assimilate, they kept their culture and customs. They were always other.</p>

<p>When things went bad in older societies (and unfortunately still today), people look for a scapegoat. The Jews due to their otherness and success were a natural scapegoat, there were multiple and numerous pogroms against them throughout Europe. For example, Jews were massacred in many German cities with the coming of plague in the 1340s onward. No serious historical scholar rejects this. If anything, the Holocaust was yet another program of massacre that had been committed against the Jews after the Roman Empire, not counting their national traumas from Babylon to Titus.</p>

<p>Jews ended up well-positioned internationally and especially the US in various industries which welcome them. Some misuse this power as do all people misuse power. They are easy to pick out because they&#39;ve been an unusually successful and hardy people. The envy and otherness explains the why behind the Holocaust denial, but when you get down to it, Holocaust denial consists of throwing a lot of things at the wall and pretending like they haven&#39;t been answered or the answer has been faked. I know that many HOlocaust deniers would pretend like your points are good reasons to deny the Holocaust, but like those points, they are surface level, slightly unrelated objections that don&#39;t get down to what the Holocaust was at it&#39;s core: a targeted program by Hitler and the Nazis to terminate European Jewry. Did that happen? The only reasonable historical statement is yes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disease rolled through the malnourished Jews in the concentration camps and a lot died.  The meaningful investigations just don&#39;t support that live people were being murdered off by the millions.  Six million dead, six million survived.  6 is their holy number.  They love the number 6.  If it was science you&#39;d call it 6.0 x 10<sup>6,</sup> which is only one significant figure (sig fig for short).  That means that it was rounded and that the extra detail isn&#39;t available or its irrelevant.  That is why its not 5,900,000 or 6,100,000, yet alone a number as low as 1,000,000.  Its insane how supposedly intelligent people have allowed themselves to be steamrolled by the Jew&#39;s holy number at only one sig fig.  The common people will always just go with the narrative of the power base so since its either illegal or poor company to say otherwise implies that the Jews are running things.  That is alone without investigating individual fields of endeavor and realizing that they are running things.  They are just the largest crock of shit propagandists that the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t literally believe that exactly 6,000,000 were killed. Of course it&#39;s rounded off, how would you know the exact number of a mass amount of people who were forced to live in ghettos and routinely persecuted by authorities and then secretly murdered? How would you have exact numbers? 6 million is an estimate. </p>

<p>Also for the record, the six million is counting those who died int he camps due to disease and starvation. If you lock someone in a room and don&#39;t feed them, you&#39;re still guilty of murder.</p>

Sure there are going to be some historians which are nuanced but can you actually refer me to a mainstream respected historian who has any clarification on the matter?  It seems to me that its a slippery slope that if it was only 5,999,999 then now we are saying that it was lovely and that that it would have been better if they were all killed.  I&#39;ve known countless people who won&#39;t touch the word Jew in a conversation with a ten foot pole because they are terrified of being perceived as being a bad person and to research anything or to challenge anything is bad form.  The public&#39;s mind in the entirety of Western Europe as well as North America have been captured by the narrative and it is unquestionable for so many reasons.</p>

<p>That&#39;s simply not true. 6 million was never a &quot;magical number&quot;. The number has been at times higher and at times lower in various sources.</p>

<p>No sane person genuinely believes that if 5,999,999 died instead of 6 million, it&#39;s not a massive tragedy. If you are hearing resistance it&#39;s because getting caught up over numbers (which we can never know) is something full out Holocaust deniers do.</p>

<p>How about the continued criminal 911Wars 16years and counting with 30 million dead or displaced, whole countries being used as pawns in oligarchic masturbation (Giorgi Schwartz)? </p>

<p>Take back your government, fire the batch of assholes in Washington, demand the Constitution be enforced and the foreign entanglements ended. We are not an empire. Start closing bases. Slash the military budget. Insane people are playing with an unfolding nuclear holocaust with their machinations and intrigue.

<p>There was a holocaust. Hundreds of millions died because of It, directly or indirectly. But how many of (((them))) actually died? And why? Were they being gassed? Or were they being denied crucial food supply? More likely than not both.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t deny It, but I do refute almost every talking point. How can one group claim victim when 20x the supposed figured died... by their good graces? No. It needed to happen. Such is a Holocaust. A sacrifice. But you won&#39;t find them sacrificing their own to achieve their goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not the previous poster but Fact 1 has no real meaning to me. WW2 was planned and organised by all 5 main powers(GB,USA,Russia,Germany and Japan) and the elites of the minor countries were also heavily invested in getting this show started for their own benefits.</p>

<p>Stalin planned to attack Germany/West late December 1941 but delayed the operation to July 1942 because of the German success in France. Their military was equipped for that offensive when Hitler has just started 2 weeks earlier.</p>

<p>This was documented by Bogdan Musial 2008, a Russian military historian, and also by Bernd Schwipper, ex NPA general(east german armee) in his book from 2015 with the help of Russian military archives.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s Hitler&#39;s secret <em>real</em> voice recording with Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, the Finnish political/military leader at the time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oET1WaG5sFk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oET1WaG5sFk</a></p>

<p>Extremely interesting recording.</p>

<p>P.S. Nobody ever taught these things during my higher school education and I had history as a selected course. Any recent history is always used for indoctrination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t know how anyone can think it’s fake, the base logic of the arguement of what many deniers have told me just doesn’t make sense and is riddled with double think. </p>

<p>Let me sum this up.
Holocaust deniers claim: the camps were not used for extermination, the numbers were exaggerated, and there was no intent. </p>

<p>So by their logic, I’m being told this </p>

<p>That the Nazis, who said a variety of nasty things about Jews. Things like: they betrayed us in WW1! We hate them! If we go to war, we will destroy them! They are evil and low! They are coming for our women and children! </p>

<p>That these Nazis who said so many vitriolic things about Jews, put them into nice camps where no extermination ever happened. Not only did they put them in nice camps, they spent extra resources to care for them with doctors and such. In a war against countries with 3-4x the manufacturing capability and many times the population. And no one died in these camps until the evil Allies disrupted their operations and supply lines. </p>

<p>All this effort to care for a people they disgust and loathe. I mean it reads to me like Nazi propaganda. </p>

<p>So why? Why expend all the extra resources to care for a people they hate when it costs so much less resources to systematically kill/work them to death. Not to mention it makes even less sense to continually move undesirables throughout the war as they could ill afford to waste the resources. But they did cause they wanted to kill them. No denier has been able to give me a straightforward answer to this that wasn’t a deflection or lie to this double think logic of deniers. And this isn’t even getting into the actual documented evidence that it happened. </p>

<p>Focus on actual theories that makes sense, that the government knew about 9/11, that the CIA helped kill JFK. Those have logical reasons and conclusions. At the very base, Holocaust denial does not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand. The Nazis gassed whole train cars at a time and presumably reused the cars after delousing. The question was why not leave anyone whom they wanted to kill on board and take them off after airing out the train? </p>

<p>As for bulletpoint 2, an integral part of the story is that Nazis used trains to forcibly relocate undesirables to camps for labor and execution. Why only say &quot;good luck&quot; to me instead of the people who claim Jews were loaded into trains whose interiors were painted with burning chemicals? </p>

<p>Also they did work them to death. With every able German being ground to dust fighting the Russians, someone had to work for the Fatherland. They took able bodied Jews, worked the ones they could to death and often killed the ones they couldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Also I&#39;m not and expert on industrial extermination but I would bet it would be easier to sort out those used for slave labor on site than to gas whole cars of unidentified people indiscriminately. </p>

Did they grind them up like they do when they cremate ppl? Then where are those tonnes of bone fragments at? And if &quot;250,000 bodies were cremated on site, this would have required vast amounts of firewood—something like 40 million kg, or around 43,000 tons.[49] This would have necessarily deforested huge areas around the camp&quot; these are just a few of the questions I have</p>

I suggest you do some research if you really are that curious.

<p>I&#39;m stating that the to say no one died at the camps and that there was no serious effort to kill the people Nazis considered &quot;undesirables&quot;, then how in any way does it make sense that the Nazis would expend so much effort to deport and move Jews to these camps, people that hated and were disgusted with by the way, only to take care of them in a time where literally every resource could of been used for that two front war they had going on just to take care of them? Which taking care of a group of people requires significantly more resources than systematically killing them and or working them to death does. Especially since millions went through those camps. </p>

<p>To expend so much resources caring for a people they hate is nonsensical on it&#39;s very face and that is essentially what Deniers claim. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t twist my words, I said they were worked to death. Why would they do it in the first place if not to kill them?

<p>I&#39;ve seen this Holocaust denial picture claiming death camps debunked and other versions with the same claims both on this very subreddit and else where. Dental clinics? Swimming pools? Soccer teams? That doesn&#39;t sounds so bad to me. It sounds like Deniers, at least some are claiming they were treated well. </p>

<p>Which goes back to my original argument. Why spend so much resources taking care of them? Why would people fight hard not to go to these camps if they were so nice? Even if they didn&#39;t give them everything the linked picture claims they do (which they didn&#39;t in reality but Deniers still tell me this) why go through all the trouble of putting them in camps in the first place when they could use every man on the front? You mentioned how illogical it would be to spend so much resources on extermination. Then why would they spend so many resources taking care of them so they could do nothing? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For your argument to have any weight you have to offer evidence that the pictures you supplied are fake. You cannot simply assert they are fake without evidence, thats not how an adult makes an argument. I could turn your point back on you and ask why were they given access to such things if they were to be killed? Again no one is claiming they didn&#39;t do anything, everyone agrees they were used for labor. Perhaps they were given such amenities because happy workers add more value than malnourished workers. Perhaps Germans aren&#39;t as cartoonish and evil as depicted in Hollywood movies which is where you seem to have gotten most of your education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is nothing but a strawman. The official story of this paryicular holocaust is wildly exagerated. The camps were not capable of the human extermination portrayed. Believing this does not mean I allign my beliefs with what you are portraying. The Nazis were very orderly and for the most part the living conditions were not as bad as what people are lead to believe for a long period. Im not saying it was great or even good, but the way history is written about it is false. If you don&#39;t believe me go visit them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So hold on, it wasn&#39;t that bad. Then it still doesn&#39;t make sense why the Nazis would spend all these resources making the camps with a decent living standard. Camps that Jews and Slavs alike fought real hard not to go too in numbers that were in the millions. </p>

<p>The Nazis did this All for a people they HATE. They made decent camps that people fought so hard not to go to, wasting resources that could easily be used to help fight their war. WHY? NO ONE CAN EVER TELL ME WHY THIS MAKES SENSE OR WHY THEY WOULD DO THIS? Why would thy go through all that effort to deport and take care of them? It just doesn&#39;t make sense. Unless they did it to kill them, which would be in line with their ideology and make sense. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not a strawman, that&#39;s a pants on the head logic hole. </p>

<p>And again, still not getting into the actual real documents that support the Holocaust, this is just a cursory logic hole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Productive for what? enslavement? Enslaving them, working them to death, and destroying their heritage is still genocide by most people&#39;s definition. and Then what about the people that couldn&#39;t work?

<p>Which again, comes around to my previous argument, why would the Nazis spend so much resources on people they hated unless they were trying to systematically kill/work them to death? Cause they can&#39;t make everyone work.</p>

have numbers,  the letter V stands for the number 6.  The 6 being absent changes the interpretation of the prophesy. It reads: “You will return, but with 6 million less.” To return to the promise land 6 million Jews must be sacrificed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand. I&#39;m not saying that believing that the numbers were lower than six million makes you an anti-Semite, it&#39;s just that those groups have a lot of overlap. It&#39;s a common tactic of Holocaust denial, because it&#39;s very difficult ot believably say nothing happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it anti-semetic to be anti-zionist and to despise that agenda? Is it anti-semetic to despise the actions of the  Israeli government in their gradual persecution, aggravation, illegal imprisonment and ongoing murder of Palastinians? Is it anti-semetic to disagree with the encroaching settlements on Palastinian land? Is it anti-semetic to disagree with the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel&#39;s capital? Is it anti-semetic to agree with the fact that Israel is an apartheid state? Is it anti-semetic to believe that the occupation of Palastine and the treatment of Palastinian people can be construed as what the Nazis started doing in Germany 70-80 years ago?</p>

<p>When you say there is a lot of hatred towards Jews, do at all recognize why this may be? Or is that anti-semetic too? </p>

<p>leuchter&#39;s testing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fred A. Leuchter Jr., a man who helped revolutionize capital punishment in the United States.  Because he has this knowledge about &quot;humanely&quot; executing others, he was asked to provide his opinion on the &quot;legitimacy&quot; of Auschwitz as an extermination site.  He damaged the site &quot;in the name of research&quot; (research which actual experts have said was flawed for various reasons).  Even though this man was not a historian, a scientist with experience testing for chemicals, or even a medical doctor, he became embraced by deniers much like yourself as an &quot;expert&quot; for no reason other than he knew how to &quot;humanely&quot; gas an individual prisoner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You act as if Leuchter is some credentialed scholar. His methods have been critiques throughly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The contents of the report, in particular Leuchter&#39;s methodology, are heavily criticised. James Roth, the manager of the lab that carried out the analysis on the samples Leuchter collected, swore under oath to the results at the trial. Roth did not learn what the trial was about until he got off the stand.[3] He later stated that cyanide would have only penetrated to a depth of around 10 micrometres, a tenth of the thickness of a human hair. The samples of brick, mortar and concrete that Leuchter took were of indeterminate thickness: not being aware of this, the lab ground the samples to a fine powder which thus severely diluted the cyanide-containing layer of each sample with an indeterminate amount of brick, varying for each sample.[3] A more accurate analysis would have been obtained by analysing the surface of the samples Leuchter collected. Roth offered the analogy that the investigation was like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber behind it.[3]</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>According to the scientists who tested Leuchters samples  himself, read here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html">http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html</a></p>

<p>This is according to James Roth, one of the scientist who tested the sample:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think the Leuchter results have any meaning. There&#39;s nothing in any of our data that says those surfaces were exposed or not.</p>

<p>He presented us with rock samples anywhere from the size of your thumb up to half the size of your fist. We broke them up with a hammer so that we could get a sub-sample; we placed it in a flask, add concentrated sulfuric acid. It undergoes a reaction that produces a red-colored solution. It is the intensity of this red color that we can relate with cyanide concentration.</p>

<p>What scientific literature is there to corroborate this statement?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, according to Roth himself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to look at what happens to cyanide when it reacts with a wall. Where does it go? How far does it go? Cyanide is a surface reaction. It&#39;s probably not going to penetrate more than 10 microns. Human hair is 100 microns in diameter. Crush this sample up, I have just diluted that sample 10,000; 100,000 times. If you&#39;re going to go look for it, you&#39;re going to look on the surface only. There&#39;s no reason to go deep, because it&#39;s not going to be there. Which was the exposed surface? I didn&#39;t even have any idea. That&#39;s like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber that&#39;s behind it. If they go in with blinders on, they will see what they want to see. What was he really trying to do? What was he trying to prove?</p>

<p>this analogy would be applicable if leuchter wasn&#39;t also sampling surface material. How could he not? You have to take off the surface to get material behind the surface. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Roth himself Leuchter did not tell him of any surface material  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>this criticism doesn&#39;t even apply as there was not any cyanide found at all. Even if it was diluted there&#39;d still be evidence of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was not found because Leuchter did not alert Roth as to which materials were surface samples as a result invalidating the test as Cyanide penetrates walls to the point where a surface cannot be tested the same as other simples. Leuchter failed to make this distinction </p>

<p>Just not the way you have been lead to believe, why you think It, or why anyone may possibly dispute it.</p>

<p>Definition of Holocaust:</p>

<p>Particular emphasis on the 2nd entry.</p>

<p>The alter being the world. It&#39;s stage. Or more, their stage. Because all the world is one.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t hear about the 70+ million dead from Russia. You don&#39;t hear of the 20+ million dead across Europe as innocent bystanders; be it happenstance, bombs, or famine.</p>

<p>But you know the figure proposed to you because It is the will of those persecuted. <em>Cough</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not so much that I think that it did not happen, as it is that I think that it may have happened in a different way/extent than we have been taught in school and on TV. The fact that you cannot question the official story in Europe is a big tell, and the details of the entire thing are up for grabs. Did exactly 6 million die? I don&#39;t know, but I doubt it.  Why are there holocaust stories playing on the BBC website on a regular basis even now? Why is the world stuck in the 1940s? I feel that it is because the Jews can&#39;t let it go and have control of the media and have to keep hammering on it. When I read about Jewish kids who are getting their grandfather&#39;s prison camp number tattooed on their arm, I really feel that they can&#39;t let it go. Nobody is tattooing them now, so they have to do it themselves to prove to themselves that they are being persecuted by goyim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yikes, I never heard about them getting the numbers of the deceased tattooed onto themselves. You&#39;d think that they wouldn&#39;t want that mark left on them.

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s a religion (retarded to believe analyzing the methods used to cover up and burn high millions of bodies with dozens of single overns on second - lol - floors for instance at Auschwitz) and as such I don&#39;t believe in the holocaustianity of the Jews. It&#39;s largely fabricated by communistic mass-murderers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying high tons of Jews were not exterminated at other camps or places. That might be true, especially after 43&quot; when the allies were terror bombing German civillians, average Jews were often scapegoated. As I have not analyzed all camps (just don&#39;t care). But those I did, looked like ordinary workers camps and most camop were simply worker camps with good facilities for something so pragmatically evil.</p>

<p>Also the Holocaust being largely horseshit. Doesn&#39;t mean that Hitler didn&#39;t start the war (he did) and that he wouldn&#39;t have mass-deported and killed a lot of Eastern Slavs in they way by colonizing Russia and Ukraine. That&#39;s all obviously true. I just believe it all would have been for the better of Europe in the end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it happened.  The camps, the photos, all the starving,dead bodies being bulldozed into a ditch.  The cremation ovens to turn the bones into ash, that they would then use as fertilizer.  </p>

<p>I had an elderly woman in college that was in the holocaust.  She taught about the holocaust, the camps, and her personal experience.  It was mostly nothing new.  They had pictures or relics of the different patches jews would were or the evolution of them as time went on.  </p>

<p>That same woman I would talk to casually after class or when I had to turn in a paper into her office.  I found out from her that she rescues cats and helps find homes for them.  She had like 70+ cats, and I think SEVEN litter boxes.  You can say she was just a crazy old cat lady.  But it seemed way more like she wanted to make a purpose of her life after surviving something so horrible that also killed most of her family and lost her home.  </p>

<p>The book keeper of Auschwitz is also a deal maker for me.  He worked there and saw most of the ongoings between the guards and other personal.  It&#39;s like a greater force made sure he survived so he could also tell his story.  &quot;The Holocaust did happen.  I know because I was there&quot;</p>

<p>Lots of other atrocities have occurred around then and since.  The purges in Stalin&#39;s Russia, Mao&#39;s China purges.  The Tiananmen Square massacre.  It wasn&#39;t 6 million but they wore machine gunned torn, mostly cut in half.  Had machine gunners gun down anyone escaping thru the street the Authorities ordered them to escape through.  Then they took the Amoured Personal Carriers and ran over the people until they were pie or paste.  Then washed down into the sewers.  </p>

<p>North Korea&#39;s Prison camps seem worse then Hitler&#39;s camps.  I also think people use it as a shield and are over sensitive about it.  Israel has turned into Nazi Germany with how they are treating the Palestinians.  Crimes against Humanity and stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, this is why I can&#39;t buy into the theory that it didn&#39;t happen. One of my favorite teachers&#39; grandparents escaped a camp and managed to survive. He told us their story and the entire class was in tears, including the teacher. There is just too much showing that they did indeed exist. The facts could definitely have been skewed, but it seems impossible that the camps were never a real thing. </p>

First the Germans just buried the corpses but later became problems with the rotting bodies due to gases and contamination of ground water. So most mass graves were opened again and those corpse remains burned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes i am familiar with the official story.
please correct me if i am wrong but 800k were buried in mass graves. when the nazis heard that the allies were getting close they exhumed the bodies and cremated then in open pits.</p>

<p>to get an idea of what 800,000 people looks like , it is 10x the number of people in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/2017_AFL_Grand_Final_panorama_during_national_anthem.jpg/1280px-2017_AFL_Grand_Final_panorama_during_national_anthem.jpg">this</a> picture.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t get me wrong, i believe that jews were murdered in WWII, but the Treblinka claim just seems to be a bit exaggerated. </p>

<p>Add to that there are no existing images of any burning pits when the allies were flying regular missions over the area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people died in world war 2. Many of them were Jews but Jews were not specifically targeted for extermination. They were welcome to stay in Germany but they had to learn to work instead of earning their living the normal Jewish way of lying, cheating and stealing. Working is unacceptable to Jews because according to Jewish scripture Jews don&#39;t work. Instead Jews enslave non-Jews through modern banking/slavery practices. The same practices that thrive today. You know, like your mortgage, car payment, debt, etc. So Hitler was going to put an end to Jews enslaving everyone through fraudulent banking practices but the Jews weren&#39;t having it. The new Hitler economy threatened the survival of the Jewish way of life (living off the fat of other people&#39;s labor) So the Jews, being highly skilled propaganda experts and liars started world war 2 because they had to get rid of Hitler before Hitler forced them to contribute something to society. So, yeah, the Jews turned everybody on Hitler and they destroyed Hitler and afterwards spread through the media that Hitler was a war crazed maniac and he started it and bla bla bla Hitler is pure evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes thank you. Someone had told me that the nazis were good with banishing all the Jews for a price to offset their economic value but Jewish organizations thought they could cash in on German Jewish oppression to make their case for a Jewish state in the holy land. Just maybe they didn&#39;t realize how bad it would get. From this Wikipedia though I&#39;m not so sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that it did not exist. Too black and white thinking there. If you were educated in the west than you have to understand a couple things. We have been served a very one sided view of the events and even when you understand an even handed look at what happened on the ground you then have to look into the motives of the powerful groups that operate at an elite level. Zionist congress, the crown, vatican/jesuits.</p>

<p>You have to understand the horror that was the NKVD. What was happening to Christians just to the east of Germany in Russia. 66 million deaths in and around. That horror cannot be understated, yet it is very much so. I have a few links.</p>

<p>Start with the uprising that was the Bolshevik Revolution.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyar0goYMdU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyar0goYMdU</a></p>

<p>You must remember that the Balfour declaration gave Palestine to Rothschild as payment for armaments word war 1. The Crown swore to uphold and defend Israel. Part of that was filling the new state with citizens. How to convince Jews around the world that it was time for the prophetic return.</p>

<p>Why we believed</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUcFPzzkuLM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUcFPzzkuLM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>Atrocity propaganda, how far it went, what has been corrected and what is still believed. The fact that historians can only work within a tightly restrained set of &quot;facts&quot;, which continuously are changing.</p>

<p>One of my biggest wtf&#39;s is the diary of Anne Frank. Every western school kid has read and written a report or saw the movie in school. Well it turns out her father wrote most of it. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v19/v19n6p-2_Faurisson.html">http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v19/v19n6p-2_Faurisson.html</a></p>

<p>So when the truth starts coming out that ball point pens weren&#39;t around and the copyright is ending they admit to it.</p>

<p><a href="https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/who-wrote-the-diary-of-anne-frank/">https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/who-wrote-the-diary-of-anne-frank/</a></p>

<p>think for yourself on that one.</p>

<p>Finally if you are not aware of Eisenhower&#39;s post war death camp look into it. As well as what happened to German women during and post war.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psicZ2LdrzE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psicZ2LdrzE</a></p>

<p>These youtube videos are meant as stepping stones.</p>

<p>I have my opinions as to what happened and i have some theories as well. Untill you get some factual information that has been hidden or obscured from us you will never be able to understand those opinions. None of them are hatred for Jews in any way. Everything is a rich mans trick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that the holocaust was fake: Jews, Gypsies, Freemasons, Slavs, homosexuals and the disabled, DID get persecuted and sent to concentration/extermination camps. The problem is the western narrative only focuses on Jews. It&#39;s the same with the Spanish inquisition. It&#39;s become a Jewish only narrative, despite the fact that Muslims were also persecuted. As well as Catholic &quot;heretics&quot;   </p>

<p>Yes the Holocaust did happen. The problem is, the Jewish aspect of the holocaust. Jews (I&#39;m Jewish BTW) are the only group who benefited from it, so we also took full control of the narrative. They say the victor writes the story, supposedly 6 million Jews died the holocaust, but for us it was a morbid victory. We got Israel, and centuries of persecution became a future of sympathy. </p>

<p>Because of this, it is forbidden to questions aspects of the story. Did Zionists collaborate with Nazis? Absolutely. Were the numbers skewed? For sure. Norman Finklestein&#39;s parents were survivors, and even he acknowledges it. Has the holocaust become an industry? No doubt about it. But it is forbidden to discuss this, and thus it is kept out of public and academic discourse. Lenny Brenner (An Atheist-Jew and Marxist) wrote two books about the Zionist relationship with Nazism. Nobody discusses his work. despite the fact it is in-depth and backed by sources (most Jewish/Zionist). </p>

<p>Yes the Holocaust happened. To deny it, is not just denying the: &quot;Jewish Holocaust&quot; but the millions of non-Jewish victims as well. The narrative needs to be open to debate and scrutiny. Jews need to not be allowed ownership of the history. But the western world has given it over, hook, line and sinker. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a reminder to the europeans here - it&#39;s illegal in most countries to deny or revise the holocaust, so make sure you write things like &quot;I&#39;m just making sure that...&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m just checking that...&quot; and so forth.</p>

<p>With that being said:
- This six million figure comes from a talmudic religious myth that says “you shall return to the land of Israel with six million less”, and WW2 birthed the state of Israel 1948
- It seems strange that the germans during a time of war would use precious metal and fuel to transport jews to camps to execute them rather then shooting them on the spot.
- I actually visited one of these camps. It seems really strange that they would make them &quot;shower&quot; to &quot;calm them down&quot;. Also strange that the ceiling in the gas chamber is around 140cm tall and is in the same building as the showers... It&#39;s almost as if they were being showered to be cleaned, and the gas chamber was being used to de-lice their clothing...
- Multiple holocaust survivors have been exposed as frauds
- The very fact it&#39;s illegal to question the holocaust is suspicious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The armenian genocide didn&#39;t happen!&quot;
OK.
&quot;The massacre at Katyn didn&#39;t happen!&quot;
No problem.
&quot;Less then 6 million jews died in the holocaust!&quot;
&quot;Come with us, sir.&quot;</p>

Now, I don&#39;t doubt that people died in the camps. It was war, there was shit like tuberculosis and other sicknesses in these camps, there wasn&#39;t enough food, there wasn&#39;t enough medicine, and so forth - but were they really systematically eliminated? One has to admit that the jews have milked it for everything it&#39;s worth. Even <em>Poland</em> is paying holocaust reparations still and it&#39;s not like we invited the Nazis here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>First.</p>

<p>You kill off free labor. You can have all the jews work until they die from undernourishment and/or exhaustion. They will cling on to the hope of survival which brings me to #2</p>

<p>Second.</p>

<p>Its just not economical. You have to build a Gas Chamber then create the chemical. Then have a very careful removal process. Wait till it leaves the air. Clean the chamber.</p>

<p>When I can put you all on a steel train say we going to free you then just light the whole train on fire and push it off some cliff.</p>

<p>Now i personally dont really feel there is enough evidence about the whole gas chamber narrative. Though I&#39;m sure many people died in the German Interment Camps from disease and malnutrition.</p>

<p>I just dont see why you would waste so much free labor and allocate so many resources to just kill someone when you could do it so much more efficiently.</p>

I&#39;m obviously not saying he definitely would do all these things, because if I were dead-set on that I wouldn&#39;t be asking about the other side of the argument, but it was almost as though he wanted revenge on everyone that resembled his father. Just running a train off the rails wouldn&#39;t be enough for the &quot;Kill &#39;em dead&quot; mindset, so he would have to go above and beyond to make sure they&#39;re dead. As for the economy, I&#39;m not so sure why he would do something that damaging. I can only guess that he didn&#39;t care too much about the country, just that as many people with traits he saw as distasteful died as possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How would you call the jewish People that fled the Nazi regime then?
If they would stay in Germany or the Nazi occupied territories in Europe then they would most likely to become victims of the Holocaust too. So they escaped the oppressive regime and already before this date ongoing imprisoning or deprotation of jews to concentration camps and survived.</p>

<p>So tell us, when you think the Holocaust started.
Was it with the Nürnberger racial laws? The Reichskristallnacht? Or with the Wannseekonferenz and Aktion Reinhardt?
It was a first slowly increasing process of systematic oppression, exclusion, expropriation and elimination which later reached an exponential curve and got more and more deadly.</p>

<p>1933 there were 510.000 jews in isrealite circles/synagoges in Germany. Until September 1939 270.000 to 315.000 
emigrated/fled. 
Also you forgot that in those numbers the austrian and czech jews that were after it&#39;s occupation part of Germany.
From the 200.000 austrian jews 65.000 died, the others could escape in the time between annexion and start of WWII.
Well also don&#39;t forget that in 1940 the Nazis already were in Poland from were also jews escaped/fled Prior to the start of &quot;Aktion Reinhardt&quot;.
From the 140.000 jews of the Netherlands 110.000 were deported and only 6000 survived.
Also there were different percentages of the jewish Population deported in Europe.
From Norway and Belgium 40% were deported, France 25%, Italy 20% and Denmark only 2%.
From the 75.000 deported French jews 3000 survived.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already told you when the Holocaust officially started: 1941. </p>

<p>Germany started enacting repressive legislation against Jews as early as 1933 (with the Nuremberg Laws)--but no one was being killed. (Interestingly, the Zionists actually lobbied <em>for</em> the Nuremberg laws, and the stripping of German citizenship from Jews. They wanted conditions in Europe to be so uncomfortable for Jews that they&#39;d want to flee to Palestine. (Up until then, it was a growing concern of the Zionists that Jews enjoyed too comfortable a life in Central and Western Europe; and that conditions would have to be changed to &quot;encourage&quot; them to help the Zionist enterprise by moving to the Middle East.) So in August 1933, the Zionists signed the Haavara Agreement with Hitler, which would channel Jews from Germany to Palestine. It&#39;s a dark and shameful chapter in Zionist history. But Google articles on how the Zionists actually lobbied to strip Jews of German citizenship, and even had a hand in the yellow star business. Sadly, I&#39;m not making this up.) See Jewish historian Lenni Brenner&#39;s &quot;51 Documents: Zionist Collaboration With the Nazis&quot;: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/51-Documents-Zionist-Collaboration-Nazis/dp/1569804338">https://www.amazon.com/51-Documents-Zionist-Collaboration-Nazis/dp/1569804338</a></p>

<p>At any rate, the first residents of concentration camps were <em>not</em> in fact Jews. But trade unionists, political dissidents, Polish resistance fighters (who were Catholic, etc.) When the Germans started tattooing inmates at Auschwitz, inmate Number One was not a Jew, but a Polish Catholic man [Stanislav Ryniak]. </p>

<p>It&#39;s sheer historical revisionism to create the impression that concentration camps = Jews. Or that Jews were the first imprisoned. In fact, they were near the end of the line of groups targeted and arrested. Poles predated them, as did union organizers, as did socialists, as did Gypsies. Stunningly, even Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses and gays were locked up before Jews were.</p>

<p>The Red Cross and other organizations visited the camps routinely (and documented the conditions, for anyone who wants to study the facts on the ground by the people who were actually there). But most people don&#39;t want to do that. They want the emotionalism of Hollywood fiction. </p>

<p>&quot;The . . . the . . . the Germans were making skin into lampshades and Jewish body-fat into soap.&quot;</p>

<p>(In fact, both of those narratives date from World War One. Not World War Two. And we know for a fact that they were fictions created by the British Ministry of Propaganda, run by Arnold Bennett. The first &quot;victims&quot; of these phony atrocity-stories were not said to be Jews, but Belgians in WWI.) Other gems from the Ministry of Propaganda were the Germans using babies for bayonet practice, the Germans crucifying Belgians, and (my favorite) the Germans rolling giant wooden rape-machines to violate the Christian maidenhood of Europe. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, Hollywood has been used as an effective propaganda tool to promote known falsehoods (such as these). Any modern history class (touching on the subject of propaganda) shows its students the propaganda films promoting the phony atrocities in World War One. The same narratives were dusted off and rehashed for WWII. But with the same basic narratives intact. </p>

<p>Even mainstream syndicated columns (like &quot;The Straight Dope&quot;) debunked the &quot;skin made into lampshades&quot; narrative. <a href="https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2511/did-the-nazis-make-lampshades-out-of-human-skin/">https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2511/did-the-nazis-make-lampshades-out-of-human-skin/</a></p>

<p>The reality is: Almost all the documented deaths at the camps were due to tuberculosis and typhus. And this because the Allies cut off supply lines to the chemicals that had hitherto been used for sanitation. </p>

<p>So is what happened a tragedy and a travesty?</p>

<p>Absolutely!</p>

<p>But it&#39;s so perverse and cruel that we don&#39;t need to add additional fake atrocities to try and amp up the emotionalism. Nor do we need to exaggerate the number of the people who actually died. (I think that, when one examines the statistics and census data, the initial Red Cross numbers of the dead (200,000) are probably the accurate figures. </p>

<p>What Hitler did was a despicable thing. And the part that many Western nations and corporations (like IBM and Ford Motor Company) had in the creation of concentration camps sickens me. And it&#39;s disturbing that not only did the Americans and British tacitly aid the Nazis in this monstrosity, but that the World Zionist Congress had a small (but chilling role in it as well). <a href="https://www.henrymakow.com/091202.html">https://www.henrymakow.com/091202.html</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: As Norm Finklestein points out, a lot of people have made a LOT of money off the Holocaust. And it behooves them (so they think) to exaggerate and fictionalize every element of it. I think, in the end, mythomaniacs do a great disservice to not only the dead, but to history. They end up trivializing it by &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; [a reduction to absurdity]. Like in the Talmud, where it claims that the Romans murdered 4 billion Jews at Bethar. (Billion, with a &quot;b&quot;). See the Talmud, Gittin 57b. Jews were big into numerology, and using numbers to stress importance. In an age before italics, it was the custom to exaggerate a number to stress its importance. So if three UN-important men died, it was related that &quot;three men died&quot;. If, however, 3 IMPORTANT men died, then the story was exaggerated to 3,000 men being killed. They have a long (and well-documented history) of doing this. But when they engage in this behavior OUTSIDE of their own culture (and Westerners, who are vastly more literalistic and analytical, get ahold of the inconsistencies) then it casts a shadow over the entire narrative. And people end up walking away, thinking [falsely] that the whole thing was made up. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, so how&#39;d they get all of these &quot;very poisonous&quot; dead bodies out of the showers? Where did they put these &quot;very poisonous&quot; dead bodies at? Did they just bury them? Cause that would contaminate the drinking water the guards and the prisoners used. Just the decaying bodies, not the &quot;poison&quot; left on the corpses. And with the supposed # &quot;killed&quot;, it would be contaminated for miles around. Did they burn them? If so, where are the bones that don&#39;t burn? Did they grind them up like they do when they cremate ppl? Then where are those tonnes of bone fragments at? And if &quot;250,000 bodies were cremated on site, this would have required vast amounts of firewood—something like 40 million kg, or around 43,000 tons.[49] This would have necessarily deforested huge areas around the camp&quot; these are just a few of the questions I have</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;At the trial, Dönitz was charged with:[27]</p>

<p>Waging unrestricted submarine warfare against neutral shipping
Permitting Hitler&#39;s Commando Order of 18 October 1942 to remain in full force when he became commander-in-chief of the Navy, and to that extent responsibility for that crime (his defence was that the order excluded men captured in naval warfare, and that the order had not been acted upon by any men under his command).
Knowing that 12,000 involuntary foreign workers were working in the shipyards, and doing nothing to stop it.
Advice in 1945 when Hitler asked Dönitz whether the Geneva Convention should be denounced. Hitler&#39;s motives were twofold. The first was that reprisals could be taken against Western Allied prisoners of war; second, it would deter German forces from surrendering to the Western Allies (as was happening on the Eastern Front where the Geneva Convention was in abeyance). Instead of arguing the conventions should never be denounced, Dönitz suggested it was not expedient to do so, so the court found against him on this issue; but as the Convention was not denounced by Germany, and British prisoners in camps under Dönitz&#39;s jurisdiction were treated strictly according to the Convention, the Court considered these mitigating circumstances.&quot; Wikipedia </p>

please correct me if i am wrong but 800k were buried in mass graves. when the nazis heard that the allies were getting close they exhumed the bodies and cremated then in open pits.</p>

<p>to get an idea of what 800,000 people looks like , it is 10x the number of people in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/2017_AFL_Grand_Final_panorama_during_national_anthem.jpg/1280px-2017_AFL_Grand_Final_panorama_during_national_anthem.jpg">this</a> picture.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t get me wrong, i believe that jews were murdered in WWII, but the Treblinka claim just seems to be a bit exaggerated. </p>
