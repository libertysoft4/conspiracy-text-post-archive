<p>Very frustrating.</p>

<p>It previously felt like the alt-lite was, well, a &quot;light&quot; version of the alt-right.</p>

<p>But somehow, a year later, that&#39;s been lost. </p>

<p>Name one substantial policy difference between Bush-era neocons and the generic MAGA base. I&#39;m struggling to come up with any.</p>

<p>The alt-lite are un-ideological Trump sycophants. They&#39;d shill for him fullheartedly regardless of how neocon or how nationalist his policies are.</p>

<p>These people are only after money and clicks to their websites. They&#39;re so blatant about this.</p>

<p>The MAGApede crowd, on the other hand, are just dumb. They worship everything Trump does and will fall for any scam by people who, ostensibly, support him.</p>

<p>Lol. Did you miss all the civilian deaths from the drone bombings too??</p>

<p>The air strike in Syria killed no one and was not precursor to a larger ground war. </p>

<p>Trump was <em>never</em> about mass deportations (though many of his supporters wouldn&#39;t mind [not me]), so it looks like you&#39;ve been reading a bit too much fake news. Border crossings are down significantly, as planned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is Trump a Nazi still? I’m confused with the Left.. you should start with them loons. Maybe that’s why Trump brought up his daughter was married to Jewish man.</p>

<p>Trump did bomb the shyt out of ISIS and probably killed their families too. What’s one thing terrorists would worry about while commuting their acts? Their families. So it’s probably not the dumbest negotiating tactic to say that their families are on the table now too if you go and blow yourself up in the name of Islam.</p>

<p>“Shut down the internet to stop ISIS”
Not sure if you just made that up.. Or if you’re taking a Trump quote out of context.</p>

<p>“Tax cuts for the rich”
90% of middle class families will be getting a tax cut.
Will the top 20% get more of the share from the 1.5 trillion tax cut (keep your own money)?
Sure, they also pay 90% of all the taxes so it makes sense they would see the most of the money.</p>

<p>Dismantling the over-regulated EPA so businesses can worry about less paperwork? Fantastic .. see stock market record highs</p>

<p>Yes, Trump &gt; Obama so far</p>

<p>Not really.  The missile attack on Syria was a ploy.  The missiles were outdated and reports after the strike indicated the base was barely damaged.  ISIS has lost a ton of land and that&#39;s good.  The decision on Ukraine was dumb but I have a feeling that was to direct attention away from Russia.  Now with the Iran stuff it really comes down to what you want.  I personally think Trump isn&#39;t going to do anything and is just tweeting out hints and small threats to move the situation in the direction he wants.  More time needs to pass before making a conclusion on Iran.</p>

<p>Platitudes without action on immigration</p>

<p>It&#39;s really hard to take action with a sluggish and unreliable Senate.  The House is probably fine but the Senate sucks.  I really think Trump wants to do more on immigration but he gets stopped at every turn.  The travel bans faced legal challenges, and his attempted moves on DACA were unsuccessful.  Hopefully he is able to get the wall funded and chain immigration out in a deal with Democrats but idk if it&#39;ll happen.  As much as anyone hates to say it, including myself, Trump needs the establishment to get anything done.  Of course, the establishment needs Trump to stay in office and get re-elected.  Look at McConnell.  He was opposed to Trump at the beginning of the year and now he&#39;s a huge ally.  Why?  Because he knew if he went against Trump that he wouldn&#39;t stand a chance.  </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s admin hasn&#39;t been perfect, and it&#39;s had rough times and he&#39;s made mistakes.  But I don&#39;t think any of the issues you brought up are really things that Trump himself is doing wrong.    </p>
