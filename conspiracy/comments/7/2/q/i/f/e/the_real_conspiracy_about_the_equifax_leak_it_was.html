<p>Take a look for yourself, after submitting to see if you were affected by the leak they offer their fucking ID protection program! This is absolutely insultive beyond any means that they would even do this to us after having a data beach and leads me to believe it was all a setup just to make more profits and that none of our data is actually truly leaked out to anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So wait, you expect them to have a massive data breach, and NOT provide people with some sort of means to protect themselves?</p>

<p>I mean I woudn&#39;t go anywhere near their TrustedID service, but them offering that up for free doesn&#39;t automatically mean that this was all a set up. I imagine that setting up a relationship with another Identity protection company so that they could give away someone elses service for free would have been expensive and time consuming. </p>

<p>To be clear, I do not support Equifax or the service they are offering, but I also do not believe that is definitive proof that this was an &quot;inside job&quot; to sell their own Identity protection. </p>

<p>The conspiracy about them offering their Identity protection to me, is that by agreeing to the terms of service to sign up for it, you are waiving your right to be part of legal action against them for the breach. In my opinion this is a much bigger issue that many people do not realize. I have read that it likely wouldn&#39;t stand up in court, but it at least proves that they are concerned about the recourse of what happened. A massive lawsuit will likely end up costing them a more than what they would bring in, in new TrustedID subscriptions AFTER the free year is up. </p>

<p>TLDR. Dont fucking sign up for TrustedID. </p>
