<p>So who is to say that around 1 billion years ago, there wasn&#39;t some mass extinction(and I mean something fucking crazy that we couldn&#39;t even imagine) event that occurred and wiped out the intelligent life at that time as well as all the other species and buried it deep deep down and we haven&#39;t discovered it yet (or maybe at all). And we are not the first intelligent beings to harbor this world? The Life before us could&#39;ve went through an entire evolution few hundred million years ago, even after the earth formed right for life, and we wouldn&#39;t even know because the earth takes everything back in that is manufactured from it. </p>

<p>Everything is of earth, so it will decompose back down into raw materials of earth, even if takes a long time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Newton&#39;s biography on Wikipedia doesn&#39;t make much sense to me, it calls him &quot;undistinguished at Cambridge&quot; but also says he discovered &quot;generalised binomial theorem&quot; there, clearly the bar was set much higher back then!</p>

<p>&quot;Newton&#39;s private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the subsequent two years saw the development of his theories on calculus, optics, and the law of gravitation.&quot;,so he NEET&#39;d it for 2 years while the Great Plague was going on and invented the Reflecting Telescope, 80 years after Brahe died, then got admitted into the Royal Society in 1699~. Right.</p>

<p>Your data only makes sense in the unlikely situation that Newton was a complete semi-isolated genius. Which he could have been.  </p>

<p>In many things, yes, but when it comes to science, sources and peer reviews decide the facts. The thing about most out of place artifacts is that they are either shown to be hoaxes, can be explained as natural products, or it can be demonstrated that a known civilization had the ability to make them (like the Nazca lines).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science readily admits that human beings, &quot;just like ourselves&quot;, have been around for at least 150,000 years and quite possibly even as much as 250,000 years based on what scant remains there are. </p>

<p>What little evidence we have regarding the earliest civilizations known to us goes back about 12,000 years with the progression that has lead to our own modern one starting about 3,500 years ago with the development of writing and being able to keep information that prior to that could only be kept alive orally and within human memory. A situation in which any accident, early death, or deadly disease, could have easily wiped-out all kinds of essential information before it could ever be passed on, some of which might never be recovered.</p>

<p>Clearly with all of that missing time about which we know nothing other than that &quot;humans just like ourselves&quot; were certainly around during them then they must have led lives that were organised and satisfactory enough to both survive and continue on throughout that inordinate amount of time.</p>

<p>As a species we are innately expressive, creative, and artistic which was what led to the development of writing at a relatively primitive stage and we have enough examples of separate and different languages arising and reaching that point in isolation from each other that such a development seems to be more likely than not whenever there is a stable and comfortable enough environment for a community to remain fixed and with enough of a surplus to permit some or even many of it&#39;s members to more thoroughly pursue and explore their innate creative, artistic, and intellectual abilities.</p>

<p>So I&#39;d consider the odds that there have been many major civilizations, perhaps even some more advanced than our own in different ways that have come and gone without a trace, to be more than likely. </p>

<p>Some of the archeological evidence we have shows that in many instances the societies and civilizations that were built on top of previous ones were less rather than more advanced than what came before them. Something we also know to be true about the builders of the great pyramid compared to all the inferior ones that were constructed well after it. More advanced and yet lost or supplanted by a less advanced one that apparently paid no attention to what was better and more developed about them than their own or unable to understand, replicate or incorporate them.</p>

<p>So we are left with some serious questions about the past that fly in the face of any notions of any steady or progressive line of human development over time. Civilizations that may have had great achievements in some areas that failed for the want of others that were replaced by ones that placed more or even all of their attention and emphasis on the missing aspects that led to failure and demise of what came before it. Perhaps more rough and ready with more practical and pragmatic aspects we merely assumed what think was more advanced before it would have known when perhaps they didn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surplus. The answer is surplus. The reason human civilization appeared so late is because humans lacked the means of having a surplus of food.  </p>

<p>For example, even to this day there are tribes that still have not advanced to civilization, for the simple reason that they lack a surplus mechanism.  </p>

<p>Why it&#39;s so important, is that a food surplus is the key that lets some people in a society focus on things other than just survival. It also allows sustaining stable settlements, a key for organized civilization.  </p>

<p>You would notice that the estimated beginning of civilization coincides with the advent of agriculture. Before agriculture tribes needed all hands on deck to survive, and thus there was no meaningful civilization besides rock paintings, simple shrines and such. Farming allowed the birth of cities, and civilizations, which is why it took so long.  </p>

<p>As for earlier civilizations, it&#39;s definitely possible (and even likely) that unknown civilizations existed between the birth of agriculture 10000 years ago, and first known civilizations like Sumer. However, there is no scientific reason to believe that any meaningful civilization existed before agriculture.  </p>

<p>There is simply zero evidence to indicate that. Not only is there no evidence, but this idea actively contradicts known evidence.</p>

We tend to move progressively slow as a species, with changes taking place collectively only after a few decades or a generation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;An absence of evidence is not evidence of absence...&quot; as I said in the beginning the normal workings of Mother Nature and the elements can obliterate and completely swallow the remains of any defunct society or civilization in a matter of few thousand years or less. </p>

<p>Our history isn&#39;t anywhere complete even in regards to ones we keep finding that have been lost and unknown within the 10,000 year window you suggest was the only one when there&#39;s no reason the entire process hadn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t have occurred countless times before at other times besides the ones we are aware of in which that same process happened in numerous places at different times giving rise to completely different human civilizations.</p>

<p>Satellite images of South America, for instance show what is believed to be thousands of acres that were irrigated at some point in time and that could have supported millions of people that have since been re-claimed by the jungle. </p>

<p>We also know that the Sahara Desert wasn&#39;t always a desert and that fossils of tropical ferns and palm trees have been found in the rocks on Baffin Island in the far north. </p>

<p>The Vikings prospered and raised enough food to support themselves and raise hundreds of valuable horses they shipped back to Scandinavia from Greenland before a sudden downturn in temperatures made it impossible for them to continue to live there.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t very well have evidence of a past civilization that was abandoned, or failed for reasons unknown that nature has had over 100,000 years to re-claim. Nothing that we have created ourselves is capable of enduring that amount of time without constant maintenance and re-building. Not enough would be left to even suggest what it was or that we even existed at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone seems to forget about Cetaceans, dolphins, whales, etc. They are highly intelligent, maybe more so than humans even. Who knows how long they have been roaming the oceans, which are two thirds of the planet. They probably know much more about the planet than we do honestly, just my opinion though.</p>

<p>As for intelligence, dolphins are exceptionally smart &quot;for an animal&quot;, but there is no scientific reason to believe that their intelligence parallels ours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, thanks! However, as humans we are incredibly biased towards our own intelligence being the pinnacle of animal intelligence. Obviously we cannot observe Cetaceans all the time and actually quantify their intelligence in terms we would understand. There are arguments to be made that they could be more intelligent as they don&#39;t wreck the environment they live in and or decimate the rest of the wildlife around them as we have. Of course &quot;intelligence&quot; is a pretty ambiguous term that only means anything to us as humans.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been quite a lot of research on dolphin intelligence, and all that&#39;s ever been found is that they are really smart for an animal species but that&#39;s it. That&#39;s just the fact of it. We can play with ideas all we want, but the facts tell the truth - dolphins are smart, but not <em>that</em> smart.  </p>

<p>Well that&#39;s just not how we define intelligence.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There are many fairly objective ways of defining intelligence. Self-awareness, problem solving, the ability to think ahead and plan. Again, dolphins are pretty good at all this, for an animal species, but nowhere near the ballpark we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right I understand what you are getting at but my only point is that we judge other animals &quot;intelligence&quot; based on what we think is important and what we define as intelligent, which is based entirely on our own cognitive capacities. I&#39;m not saying they are more or less intelligent than us just that they exhibit different forms of intelligence. But humans have massive ego problems as well which force us to see ourselves as the pinnacle of nature. Or we think we are so special and intelligent that we had to be created by some other ultra intelligent being like God. </p>

<p>Ya know, the human brain is the most complex thing in the universe... according to the human brain. See what I&#39;m getting at?? </p>

<p>Also I am willing to make the argument that &quot;intelligent&quot; creatures would not destroy the only environment they have to live in in exchange for short term gains such as humans have.</p>
