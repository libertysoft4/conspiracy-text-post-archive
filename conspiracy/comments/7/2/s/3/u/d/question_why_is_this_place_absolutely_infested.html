<p>You know exactly what I mean when I say ‘not allowed’. You choose to pick at that technicality instead of addressing the actual point.

    <div class="md"><p>His administration hasn’t been caught sending classified information over private email servers yet. Nor did they delete 33,000 emails when this was brought to attention. That’s a big difference. </p>

<p>No doubt Trump isn’t 100% clean but he’s not the one who fucked over Libya and Haiti like Clinton did. There is a lot of hard evidence for a Clinton being a shady person. No hard evidence against Trump yet despite heavy monitoring before the election. </p>

<p>Hillary received hundreds of millions of dollars in donations from fucked up places like Saudi Arabia... why would a country that doesn’t think much of women at all donate to a female presidential candidate if it weren’t for some expected political favours? The Ukrainian government which Obama helped put in after a coup was also trying hard to influence the election to help Hillary. We know Hillary’s team met with Chinese government officials before the election, no doubt they were trying to get some dirt on Trump too. That’s politics </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question: had those e-mails been between two non-Democratic politicians - say, between two normal, regular-ass businessmen somewhere - would the conversations contained in those e-mails, the ones that mentioned pizza - would they have bothered you at all? Would you have interpreted them to be about child pornography and pedophilia if the exact same words had been exchanged between politicians you didn&#39;t already dislike? Because it seems to me that, if you remove the imposed context of, &quot;these are  high-level crooked politicians discussing raping and murdering children,&quot; that much of the material in those e-mails that led to pizzagate were actually benign and straightforward. It seems like the only reason people thought that they had any sinister double-meaning is because they originated from public figures that people on this sub <em>already</em> hated.</p>

I won’t post the links here because they seriously are messed up. Look them up for yourself and try to make a sane explanation for them. Fair enough the $65,000 worth of ‘hotdogs’ Obama had flown in for a party could have been drugs, however the instagram posts are far less ambiguous</p>

Again, the only reason why this is even an issue is because Alefantis <em>is connected to the Clintons and Podesta</em> via this theory. Of course, <em>independently</em> of his connection to Clinton, no one would give a shit about Alefantis. Your rebuttal just bolsters my original point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Left know on some level that their arguments are rationally unsupportable, and as a result, they don&#39;t try.  The only tactics they have available to them are defamation, psychological abuse, and censorship.  The only real reason why downvoting has ever existed on this site, is to ensure that the radical Left are able to prevent people from seeing posts or comments which demonstrate the logical illegitimacy of their perspectives.</p>

<p>Cointelpro is an issue to a degree; but I think it&#39;s more often SJW brigading than the government or intelligence community.  It&#39;s mostly a combination of <a href="/r/Socialism">/r/Socialism</a> leaking, and/or permanent sleeper agents who have been installed here to run interference.</p>

<p>A big clue is to look at posting/comment history length and karma score.  If both of those are low, that is a warning sign about the legitimacy of the account in question.  I find that most promotional accounts don&#39;t bother trying to make them look like real users, so they&#39;re pretty easy to spot.</p>

<p>Another trick that the <a href="/r/Socialism">/r/Socialism</a> crowd have been trying in here recently, is to simply start submitting the sorts of threads that they&#39;d have in their own sub, in order to try and simply drown the rest of us out.  If you encounter threads in here about Chelsea Manning or minority politics, then that is what you&#39;re likely seeing.</p>

<p>Over the seven years I&#39;ve used Reddit, I have become much more angry with the Left than the Right.  The hard Right can be dangerous at times, but in my experience they are nowhere near as devious or indirect as Marxists are.  A conservative who disagrees with you will usually try and debate you, because they will be confident that they can prove their point.  A Marxist won&#39;t, because they have no confidence in the validity of their opinions, and they are also fundamentally motivated by malevolence.  </p>

<p>Marxists believe in operating by subversion and the complete destruction of their opponents.  They have no integrity, and no regard for anyone who is not part of their own groups.  If you&#39;re not one of them, then as far as they are concerned you are the enemy and may be destroyed with impunity.  Mercy is not something they believe in.</p>

<p>That has not been my experience at all.  I love a good debate.  And I&#39;m able to debate my leftist friends well.  My conservative friends?

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like the old people who make up our economic elite in North America have discovered (finally) that generations are growing up without corporate TV warping their minds. In their senile state of mind, they think they can turn up the noise / static and effectively silence our communications.<br/>
Meanwhile peer to peer communications are being developed that make the current internet look like the Gutenberg press. The ancient oligarchs can barely understand the current internet, let alone the future of decentralized networks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thought is power.  Proper thinking and accurately assessing what&#39;s <em>really</em> going on around you gives you a much greater ability to control the outcome of things.</p>

<p>This creates a stronger populace...and TPTB don&#39;t want that - so some hire paid shills and trolls to disrupt a natural, organic flow of information and divert it <em>away</em> from actual knowing.</p>

<p>There&#39;s that, and there are also individuals who are not paid by anyone, but are ignorant &quot;useful idiots&quot; as it were who troll the waters for free.  This is lamentable because they only detriment themselves by disrupting honest inquiry.</p>

<p>There is actually quite a lot of corporate and political astroturfing organizations all over the world that are active on forums and social media sites. The USA has the most registered organizations when measuring worldwide.</p>

<p>There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue (formerly Correct the Record) and Media Matters. They are all run by David Brock. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools. </p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>
