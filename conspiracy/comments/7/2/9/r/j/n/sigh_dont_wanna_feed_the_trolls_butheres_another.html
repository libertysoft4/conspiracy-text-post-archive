<p>Many things for sure.  Not everything, however.</p>

<p>Have you considered that &#39;flat earth&#39; is not so much the psyop for those who entertain it enough to ask questions</p>

<p>It might not be a psyop for <em>some</em> who entertain it enough to ask questions.  Many are indeed very much trapped in the psyop, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[no different than a thought experiment]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure - for those intelligent enough to entertain it as only that.  Too many don’t seem to be intelligent enough to do such, however, and are simply falling for the psyop hook, line, and sinker.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the psyop is where the people who develop superiority complexes and attack those who fell for it fully [who also developed superiority complexes].</p>

<p>Some who show flat Earth to be the falsity it is develop superiority complexes.  Sure.</p>

<p>Most certainly not all, however.</p>

<p>Rather it&#39;s merely another hegelian dialectic.</p>

<p>It certainly can be that.  Understood.</p>

<p>Either side is a psyop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost any and every side <em>can</em> be a psyop if it comports itself unintelligently.</p>

<p>Critical thinking seems to be the antidote, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems like the effective trolling is between both sides of &#39;believers&#39; who feel they know the shape of the earth, who feel the other side is dumber &#39;they don&#39;t&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, for those who comport themselves in a holier than thou manner, perhaps it’s a psyop on them.  Many who understand that the planets are most definitely <em>not</em> flat can refute and do away with flat Earthers without having to have any type of superiority complex, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without ever engaging in anything which would impart true knowledge about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s certainly the case with some people - in any subject really.  Most definitely not all, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Isn&#39;t the real psyop the need to believe in things?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The real psyop is TPTB’s ensnaring of impressionable minds with false paradigms and incorrect information.  The impressionable minds themselves aren’t the psyop.  Those who <em>manipulate</em> those minds with false information are the psyop.</p>

<p>More than semantics. The geoid within each geodetic frame is flat. So perceivably, to the observer within the frame (260km2 is the upper limit for plane surveying), everything is flat and it&#39;s a flat earth.</p>

<p>If you combine the geodesy which is explained by gravity potential, and the curvature of space time (which is the definition of gravity) there is no real measurement of curvature or the sphere except on the macroscopic scale, measuring difference in gravity which is said to be bending of space time.</p>

<p>E.g. the earth is flat when you are on it, and space-time bends to produce what is said to be the sphere on the macro scale. But the sphere isn&#39;t measurable in the traditional sense (which explains why pythagorean models do not mirror observations).</p>

<p>It&#39;s not semantics because it uses the official explanations but gives an answer which does not allow the hegelian dialectic. It states by deduction either claim [as an absolute] is false.</p>

<p>The sphere side of it is as much of a psyop as the flat side, yet it was engrained over generations - it&#39;s taught in absolute form to children. It promotes a belief system stored as knowledge without discovery.</p>

<p>This thread was created claiming &quot;don&#39;t wanna feed the trolls&quot; yet in action it&#39;s merely trolling those who believe in a flat earth. </p>

<p>If one believes in either without experimenting or seeking some means of measuring it, both are based in belief, no different than a belief in religion or ghosts or anything. Because of it&#39;s size it&#39;s nearly impossible to directly measure it, so even a somewhat concrete answer will always be limited to &#39;the evidence suggests&#39; - though the spherical triangle measurement would be probably the best method with very limited falsifiability - it has never been done, except the rumoured case by Gauss in 1855, which is declared &#39;myth&#39; today even though it was cited in textbooks for ~150 years..</p>

<p>The best means of discovery tends to be attempting to falsify [by unbiased experimentation] the obvious or perceived results of whatever conclusions are made. So in a sense, if &#39;flat earthers&#39; are actually measuring something or trying to falsify the globe model they&#39;re at least engaging in an attempt to discover.</p>

<p>What was the intent of the post? Did you expect a full-fledged &#39;flat earther&#39; to arrive and realize they were wrong, or come in and contest the footage (only to incite a verbal sparring match). How many options are available in the framing of the post?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a weakness in the premise. The footage was assuredly edited in a video editor / ps/ae. We see that with the names chicago/milwakee overlaid. Nothing proves the voice audio was made with the footage. It could be dubbed later.</p>

<p>In fact there&#39;s a moon video floating around on the moon missions where they are rehearsing and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCHG6uJH5L8">staging their record of distance and communications</a> - no claim being made about the overall mission or exactly what they were doing, but it shows another side to finished video.</p>

<p>What about the OP video provides any concrete evidence of anything? It doesn&#39;t because it&#39;s not an hard analysis determining anything. Simply a claim or challenge to others who believe <em>other things</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KS-ypy88fY">This video of a destroyed shuttle has the same camera pan movements</a> - Is that the indication of a &#39;real&#39; video, like in the OP?</p>

<p>You perpetrate a misidentification fallacy while thinking you’re making a valid point.  You do yourself zero favors this way.</p>

<p>Independent of this fault in thinking on your part, you further fail to realize that you yourself “go with other people’s data” just as much.  The only difference is that I’m aware of it in myself, while you’re apparently oblivious to it in yourself - making it far more insidious and dangerous in your case since you’re blind to it.</p>

<p>The rest of what you said is a reiterated parroting of your previous points, which were already heard and thereby fall empty upon repeating.</p>

<p>A fisheye lens is just a very wide angle lens. </p>

<p>Why wouldnt they use the widest angle lens they could? People who make that argument dont know anything about photography. </p>
