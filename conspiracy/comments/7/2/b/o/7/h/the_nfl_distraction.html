Something might be happening, and it&#39;s always good to keep your head up and look for them. Don&#39;t let the media distract us using their stupid and pointless news stories.</p>

<p>EDIT: Many people have stated it&#39;s more of a Trump centered issue rather than the media, but I personally view Trump as a part of media since the media is how he voices his grievances and concerns. As well, the media is what took Trump&#39;s statement and ran with it. Trump was the &#39;powder keg&#39;, I think someone in the comments referred to him as, but the media networks are the ones who are like stupid and annoyingly loud monkeys chattering.</p>

<p>Absolutely.  It became even more blatantly obvious when Trump stated as much himself, it&#39;s a conversation he is incapable of having, so he panders to his ever-shrinking base of supporters by dumbing it down to buzzwords like &quot;unpatriotic&quot; and &quot;disrespectful&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently you need to look it up, because slavery, &quot;radical&quot; abolitionists, laws like the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, slaveocracy fears, etc. all significantly contributed to heightened tensions between Northern and Southern states. </p>

<p>The outbreak of the Civil War was the result of a culmination of events and laws. It turns out many of these events and laws were related to SLAVERY. </p>

<p>Saying that states seceding from the Union had nothing to do with preserving the institution of slavery is incredibly dishonest. </p>

<p>The result of this propaganda is that now people might think you must either be 1) in favor of police brutality or 2) a statist who loves the <em>panem et circenses</em> idea of athletes competing in the name of a fake collective.</p>

<p>Same thing with Black Lives Matte during Obama: you either support the police state, or the violent/racist BLM thugs. Typical hegelian dialectic.</p>

<p>So rather than what&#39;s the media covering up, the question that should be asked is what&#39;s Trump trying to deflect?</p>

<p>Healthcare fiasco?
No commitment to Puerto Rico?
Manafort indictment?
North Korea threatening an above ground hydrogen bomb test?

He even managed to drag other sports franchises into this stupid debate that they originally had no part of. And what is the end result? More needless division. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re saying. I didn&#39;t do any personal attacks. I&#39;ve spelled this out for you multiple times, I&#39;ll try again---&gt; </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying the outrage is a fake(faux) outrage about the anthem. </p>

<p>The conservative media expressed the same outrage when black athletes wore SHIRTS that addressed police brutality. Called them cop haters, etc. </p>

<p>So after awhile athletes started protesting by kneeling during the anthem. Now all the outrage is about kneeling during the anthem. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is the outrage changes every time while the issue(police brutality) is never addressed.</p>

<p>Which that is the point of the faux outrage, to distract from anyone talking about the actual issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man so close, it&#39;s actually not to piss people off, even though it&#39;s understood that it may in fact piss some people off.</p>

<p>The issue of police brutality was so important to someone that they were actually willing to take a knee during an event that we all would traditionally stand for out of respect. Just to bring awareness to the issue. </p>

<p>I completely understand it&#39;s upsetting to watch someone take a knee during a time you may consider to be really sacred. But that&#39;s the point, this issue of police brutality is so important that people are willing to upset some because primarily blacks are being murdered by cops and they&#39;re getting away with it at an alarming rate. </p>

It makes it difficult for me (and millions of other people) to support a cause by making me hate the activists.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I am telling you why it&#39;s the national anthem right now, I am NOT dodging the question in any sense. </p>

<p>The national anthem was chosen because of its significance. Not to say fck America or <em>directly</em> disrespect our Veterans, but because other avenues had already been attempted and the issue was ignored. </p>

<p>And I suspect the same thing will happen with this National Anthem protesting just like last time. Everyone on the right is going to call the athletes unpatriotic, ridicule them, label as cop haters, etc just like they did w/ the shirts. </p>

<p>Then the right will never actually discuss the issue of police brutality, and by then another innocent black man has already been shot/killed for no reason.</p>

<p>Unless we try to understand both sides of the issue and not just your own, the issues we face today will remain well into the future. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t accept the premise.  I don&#39;t see it ignored at all.   I&#39;ll go one step further and say this is hurting the cause.<br/>
50 people trying to get home from a long day of work, freeway shut down by black lives matter.  Help or hurt the cause?<br/>
Choosing to disrespect the American Flag and the National Anthem, help or hurt the cause?<br/>
I don&#39;t see how pissing people off &quot;brings attention&quot;, any positive attention anyway.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then the right will never actually discuss the issue of police brutality,</p>

<p>But the conversation isn&#39;t about police brutality is it?  It&#39;s about the national anthem and the players.<br/>
Nobody is now &quot;more aware&quot;, net result is just a bunch of pissed of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you mention is a problem created by the right wing. Not the protestors. </p>

<p>Do I wish I had some perfect fucking answer where I&#39;m like hey black athletes go protest here and everyone will listen and be respectful and we&#39;ll all talk about it afterwards with solutions?!? </p>

<p>Of fucking course, but that&#39;s not reality. So if, at the very minimum, protesting is going to piss some people off just to at least make the issue relevant, then I say fuckin do it. </p>

<p>The only reason why the conversation isn&#39;t primarily about police brutality is again because of the right wing changing the narrative calling them unpatriotic, cop haters, etc. which admittedly works really well too. That&#39;s why we&#39;re here rn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many different psyops are happening with this NFL thing.</p>

<p>Overall, ratings ARE down, the game IS softer, and penalties do make the games unwatchable at times. </p>

<p>All major social institutions are beginning to wobble at the knees. Silicon Valley with the &quot;diversity&quot; blowback, finance with the massive bubble, Washington with the Awan scandal, Hollywood box office way down, etc. We&#39;re 2-3 years away from many institutions collapsing. Currently everything is in decline. All foundations will give out at the same time when the entire structure collapses (sound familiar?).</p>

<p>I see this as the beginning of the end for the power of sports in the USA. It is also the beginning of the end for the brainwashing of the flag on the US public. It&#39;s an attack on patriotism, and it&#39;s about damn time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These NFL players...</p>

<p>Every one of them is university educated and yet instead of thinking of solutions to the issues they&#39;re upset about and leveraging their fame to push these solutions to local and national politicians...</p>

<p>All they can think to do is disrespect the National Anthem.  Like that&#39;s going to lead to anything getting fixed.  But hey, at least it&#39;s a quick easy way to signal virtue to the other thoughtless people coming out of our &#39;educational&#39; system.</p>

<p>Seriously guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oooo I like your point too. And that&#39;s what is soo frustrating about all this. </p>

<p>I think everyone just needs to be more empathetic to someone else&#39;s viewpoint. And since Trump can be so divisive, it becomes difficult for people to actually talk about the actual issue. </p>
