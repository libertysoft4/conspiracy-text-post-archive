<p>Also, if they were to replace our jobs, capatalism, which is a big Ponzi scheme like Socialsm and Comunism, would have to be replaced altogether. There is no way for capatalism to work when 90% of the employees are robots. Now, if we didn&#39;t use money and let the robots simply serve society with whatever it is we need, all would be well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We would share it. Right now, the Queen owns 1/6th of all land and we all mostly pay rent (Mafia tax) to her sometimes in our lives. </p>

<p>Sharing is the name Of the game. We would, at first, stay where we are whether we live in a shack or a mansion. That will be our home but we can also move. All we would need to do is look for a vacant home posted on real estate websites. First come first serve. Many homeless people will be thrilled for this opportunity. When we get bored, we can switch homes. If need be, we can build more homes or tear down shacks and build real homes above them. There should be a 24/7 group of construction workers in every city doing this just to improve local wealth. </p>

<p>One thing I&#39;m looking forward to is an end of moving furniture. We can simply leave furniture in our old homes and use the furniture from our new homes or even order brand new furniture for free. That will save a lot of hassle which we all dread. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with sharing is that people don&#39;t value something that is owned collectively as much as something that is owned privately. For example whenever a government tries to have farmers farm on public land they tend to extract as much value in the short term and ignore long term consequences (depleted soil), while private farmers plan for the future because if the deplete their land they are screwed. There are other examples of this like public housing, public transport, etc. It seems to me that the only way a sharing economy could be sustainable is if was completely run by AI and I&#39;m not sure thats desirable. I&#39;m with you on the furniture thing though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problems that come with a sharing economy vs the &quot;every man for himself&quot; problems will be much lighter particularly because it is in all of our best interest to make a wealthy planet. If I went to my local liquor store and saw the owner drunk on the floor with a giant mess of a store, I would be upset because this store also belongs to me and it serves me and my community where I live. Other community members would also be upset and if the store worker isn&#39;t fixable, we would have to have him replaced with someone who can be a bit more professional. </p>

<p>These things won&#39;t happen often. A team is a team and by making everyone in the same team helps because we all watch each other and help each other. When the lady who runs the frame store went bankrupt, nobody could help her. She lost everything thanks to capatalism. If this was a sharing economy like Sacred Economics, she would never be under that kind of a risk. The thing that can happen in a sharing economy is that nobody uses her store so it gets converted into something the people need and she would have to go through the hassle of finding a new job which, to most, is way better than bankruptcy. </p>

<p>Imagine dropping all that stress once and for all. It&#39;s beautiful to even think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting video. I like what you&#39;re saying, but unfortunately I don&#39;t think its feasible. In the video the narrator says that money has use because it can be used in exchanges and to keep track of things, but what he leaves out is the importance of money to the price mechanism. Money is needed for prices to exist, and the information a price conveys (abundance, desirability etc) is necessary in preventing surpluses and shortages as well as to allocate resources rationally. Without this mechanism the value of everything becomes arbitrary resulting in scarcity and poorly allocated resources. Bread lines in the USSR were a function of this, in fact to get an idea of how to price things they would base their prices off of Sears magazine products. Money is information and if it is removed we are simply removing valuable information we would otherwise have in order to make rational economic decisions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you mean but what they aren&#39;t telling you is how they manipulate information to fool the public. Some examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They hide most of the oceans worth of resources they harvested to make us think we don&#39;t have enough for everybody and to raise prices on good using artificially low supply numbers. If they were to tell us the truth on how much resource we had, prices would drop by 90%. </p></li>
<li><p>They lie about how technology could make our economic lives easier. They hide this technology such as high tech 3D printers, zero-point energy (unlimited free energy), robot ai workers, and much more. They would rather keep us as slaves. </p></li>
<li><p>They lie about systems in the economy that are leeches or parasites on the system such as the Federal Reserve. Without these leeches, the economy would explode but again, they don&#39;t want that. </p></li>
<li><p>They lie to economic students in college. They don&#39;t give them working economic models because that defeats the purpose of keeping a shabby economy. </p></li>
<li><p>Plus a lot more. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Money does some good but it does a lot more harm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 100% with you about the artificial scarcity stuff. I think where we disagree is that the bad stuff you describe in your list, to me, is a function of government intervention in markets and crony capitalism causing problems like war, scarcity, the Fed, debt, taxes, not capitalism itself. It is the government that is suppressing these technologies, in a free market someone who created something like a zero point energy device would have every incentive to sell their product, while the gov&#39;t has the incentive to hoard the tech in order to maintain debt slavery, big oil, war etc. The other problems you describe, which are caused by extreme poverty, like prostitution, theft, gang activity, have actually been alleviated by free markets especially China and India as people can choose to work in a factory instead of selling their bodies. Anyway I commend you on trying to come up with solutions rather than simply pointing out problems. Keep up the good fight</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. One final point I&#39;d like to make is that my strategy is to NOT give the government a chance to screw us over. Without money, they have no chance. </p>

<p>Back in the day, Alexander the Great liberated the world economy by forcing the richest people to spread their wealth across the world. The world economy blew up for 50 years and then things began to revert for the next 50 years until the world was poor again and a few people were filthy rich. The moral to the story is that as long as we put value into small pieces of paper or rock, someone can hoard it all leaving the rest of us in shambles. It has always happened in history. Even if we change the laws and end the corruption, after years of thinking, the lowest scum of the earth will find another way to hoard it all. </p>

People always focus on skynet stuff when imagining AI scenarios, but there are alternatives that are much more uplifting. </p>

<p>In reality AI will be a mythical/constructed narrative that roughly sounds like AI to the masses but it is controlled by the same old PTB who will now be freer to conduct themselves as they see fit ie. more ruthlessly, violently, prejudicially, psychopathically and then conveniently blame it on AI when entire countries are nuked or have nano insect swarms unleashed on them that inject long acting drugs or burrow into your brain etc...</p>
