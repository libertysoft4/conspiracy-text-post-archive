    <div class="md"><p>We have automod set up to filter (which removes, but puts the link in our mod queue) any link to &quot;voat.co / v / pizzagate.&quot; This was done several months ago due to the admins taking action against several of our mods who had approved such links which the admins determined to be doxxing. </p>

<p>As the admins explained it to us, we&#39;re responsible for any content found on these external pages which is deemed to be PII in their eyes. Given that voat pages can be changed (edited or additional comments), we decided to take this perhaps overly cautious approach of removing all v/pizzagate links to defend this sub from the fate of r/pizzagate.</p>

<p>If you want to post the <em>content</em> of those links, and that content does not contain PII, we will not remove them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow this raises a lot of questions in my mind. First off, thanks Celine for the speedy reply, I truly do respect the mods here. </p>

<p>Second, is this the first time admin action has been taken against moderators of conspiracy for links/content posted on this sub? </p>

<p>Why are they so quick to jump to doxxing? These are all well known people, Podesta, James Alefantis, etc. How is this determined to be doxxing?</p>

<p>Has there ever been any concern over voat links before regarding other subjects or only in relation to pizzagate?</p>

<p>My apologies for the barrage of questions I just find it sketchy about their targeted interference with anything regarding pizzagate. Meanwhile other things slide right by them yet pizzagate always receives this kind of attention from Reddit Admins.</p>

<p>I understand the cautious need after the removal of <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> but something really is not adding up here and it makes me kind of sick to my stomach.</p>

<p>Any insight from a moderator&#39;s perspective is appreciated, and again, thanks for the speedy reply. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She seems to be saying <em>not</em> that the linked voat pages have personal information, but that pizzagate on voat is generally un-linkable because there have been doxxings on that part of that site historically.</p>

<p>Which would be pretty weak. And, if true, I can&#39;t believe really in the reddit TOS.</p>

<p>Whether the TOS is about doxxing on Reddit itself, or also prohibits links to pages that doxx, this seems beyond even that in kneejerk auto-removal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s reasonable from the perspective of the moderators trying to prevent the community from being shut down. It&#39;s indefensible from the perspective of the admins censoring information to protect powerful criminals.  </p>

<p>I think the only fair compromise is that the mods place a loud-and-clear sidebar or permanent sticky informing readers that the admins <em>really</em> don&#39;t want us linking to that particular subverse and that is the sole reason for the automoderation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about PG is that it is based on verified emails. These emails undoubtedly contain very strange things, things that are very suggestive of pedophilia and weird occult practices. So if these things are actually just totally innocent, why has there been no explanation, no &#39;oh, you silly people, this actually refers to this&#39; &#39;or this means that&#39; or whatever, so that people could go &#39;ohhhhh rigghhhht, that&#39;s what that means. Thank god, I was really worried.&#39;</p>

<p>Because people are genuinely really upset and worried about it, and you&#39;d think the people accused of these things would do more to prove the harmlessness of their communications if they were easy to prove to be harmless. You&#39;d think if they really had nothing to hide, the whole thing would have actually been genuinely debunked somewhere. But whenever you see the word &#39;debunked&#39; with relation to PG, that&#39;s all it is, a sentence saying &#39;it&#39;s been debunked&#39; and never any actual debunking, no going through all those seemingly sick images, or the weird emails and explaining at least a portion of them. No nothing. Just links to other articles that also say &#39;it&#39;s been debunked&#39; with no explanation, and perhaps a link to another article that just says &#39;debunked&#39; with no debunking and on and on. </p>

<p>What are the questions you ask that people can&#39;t answer and that elicit this default attack and insult response? You can ask me, I promise I am never an attack and insult type person and am very open to having my mind changed. In fact, that&#39;s how come I ended up realising that there was a significant amount of truth to the PG thing!</p>

Like my boyfriend ridicules me constantly and asks for evidence, and then refuses to actually look at any of the evidence I send him, and then continues to ridicule me! And anyhthing he has looked at that can&#39;t be denied, he responds to with &#39;why are you so negative, why are you looking at this stuff anyway, there&#39;s nothing you can do about it.&#39; Or, &#39;why odn&#39;t you go to the police?!

<p><em>The conspiracy theory has been widely discredited and debunked. It has been judged to be false after detailed investigation by the fact-checking website Snopes.com and The New York Times and numerous news organizations have debunked it as a conspiracy theory, including the New York Observer, The Washington Post, The Independent in London, The Huffington Post, The Washington Times, the Los Angeles Times, Fox News and the Miami Herald.

    <div class="md"><p>However, if you look for the actual debunkig anywhere, you can&#39;t find it. Nowhere is there a rundown of the evidence and the claims, and an explanation of why the interpretation is wrong. Because Pizzagate was based on actual verified emails from actual people in government and their employees and contractors. And people wre very concerned about what was in those emails. Yet nowhere has anyone gone through all those very strange, sinister emails and pointed out why they are actually innocent and nothing to do with pedophilia. </p>

<p>Even the police department - they said they&#39;d debunked it because they&#39;d investigated and found nothing, but an FOIA request for details of the investigation forced the police department to admit that they hadn&#39;t actually done any investigation. Why not? Because it had already been &#39;debunked&#39; apparently. They said that without saying who debunked it or where. All the claims of debunking are circular and lead to no actual debunking. Just saying something has been debunked does not mean it has been debunked. And it&#39;s not as though PG came from made up stuff, it came from real evidence. If people interpreted that evidence wrongly, then fine, but it needs explanation at the very very least.</p>

<p>And remember that anyone can edit Wikipedia. That PG article did include much more genuine information, but it kept getting deleted over and over again. Information with links to the Wikileaks emails, with links to historical articles from Wikipedia-approved sources etc. But they were deleted over and over. It&#39;s also a known issue with Wikipedia that it can get corrupted by people paid to edit it, by corporations, individuals, governments etc. And that&#39;s what happened with this.</p>

<p>This is from his website <a href="https://www.stallman.org/archives/2006-may-aug.html#05%20June%202006%20%28Dutch%20paedophiles%20form%20political%20party%29">https://www.stallman.org/archives/2006-may-aug.html#05%20June%202006%20%28Dutch%20paedophiles%20form%20political%20party%29</a></p>

<p><em>I am skeptical of the claim that voluntarily pedophilia harms children. The arguments that it causes harm seem to be based on cases which aren&#39;t voluntary, which are then stretched by parents who are horrified by the idea that their little baby is maturing.</em></p>

<p>RMS is very very intelligent, he know what words mean as demonstrated by all his writings so his choice of a wording is important as the word used to indicated sexual mature teenagers isn&#39;t the word he used.</p>
