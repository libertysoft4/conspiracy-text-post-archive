    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care enough to be spoon feeding someone who might just be taking the piss. I have presented a claim that goes directly against OP&#39;s claim, and now that I have people who actually give a shit about Hitler&#39;s eating habits are aware of these counter claims where only one side can be right. As far as I&#39;m concerened I have already done the absoloute minimum for the sake of keeping factual.</p>

<p>Hitler&#39;s favourite food was quail according to his autobiographer (IIRC). He had a lot of ingestation problems relating to food. Himmler designed the notion of Hitler being a vegeterian along with the idea that he didn&#39;t drink or smoke (also a fabrication).</p>

<p>If you <strong>actually</strong> give enough of a shit then research it yourself, it&#39;ll take 3 minutes through Google. This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, all claims <em>should</em> be independantly verified if there are claims in opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure going by your logic EVERYONE should do their research before they even post anything or research counter arguments but thats not going to happen.</p>

<p>If you care enough to make a comment about something being wrong - which is good because misinformation should not spread but be corrected - you could also invest the 3 minutes to look up a source or something because MOST likely the other guy wont do it himself.</p>

<p>If you dont care enough to do that, why even bother to comment in the first place. Sure as you said maybe you have people who give a shit about that now but most likely they wont give enough shits to look it up</p>

<p>Also as you said it was the absoloute minimum but IMO that wont achieve much</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey! You&#39;re right, I probably should provide sources and take the time to help people out. That would be the decent thing to do. I was posting under the assumption that this factoid beong a myth was commom knowledge, this is apparently not the case and so the burden of proof lies on me. Yet here I am, poised between caring enough to have this conversation and not caring enough to open up a new tab, google my sources, and present them here.</p>

<p>I actually still can&#39;t be bothered. So instead of deliberating as to if Hitler liked meat in his mouth I instead propose that we examine human laziness and the relative weight we place on rambling with our cute digital squiggles vs making an effort to sift through hyperlinks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay one city requires employers to use preferred pronouns, yeah that&#39;s a thing. But reading the statute it&#39;s not a fine for using the incorrect pronoun its a fine that results from “willful, wanton, or malicious” conduct, and not something that applies to interpersonal interactions. I&#39;d imagine if anyone actually were fined it would appeal up the ladder and the supreme court would rule on its status as <em>discrimination</em>, which is what that law&#39;s about, not speech.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m arguing semantics but that&#39;s not a limit on speech anymore than an employer can&#39;t refer to you with racial, homophobic, or sexist slurs. Honestly, that seems like a &quot;don&#39;t be a asshole&quot; law but you&#39;re free to interpret it as an attack on free speech. </p>

<p>1st amendment, right to freedom of speech - by saying or searching for keywords they don&#39;t like, you can be put on a list. Once you&#39;re on that list, they&#39;re allowed to experiment on you. I don&#39;t remember where that is but when I find it I&#39;ll try to remember to come back and post the link.</p>

<p>1st amendment, freedom of the press - they&#39;re pressuring alternative media outlets to shut down &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; alternative media</p>

<p>1st amendment, petitioning the government fo redress of grievances -- unless you&#39;re a targeted individual chosen as target practive for the new world order. No grievance redressing for you.</p>

<p>2nd amendment, of course the fake MKULTRA driven bullshit shootings are an attack on the 2nd amendment.</p>

<p>4th amendment, unreasonable search and seizures - they don&#39;t need a warrant for anything anymore, probably cause is assumed and there are no consequences when they accidentally shoot up the wrong house.</p>

<p>5th amendment - due process - they can put you in solitary confinement without informing your family or lawyer or asking a judge permission. It&#39;s horrifying.</p>

<p>6th amendment, right to fair and speedy trial. Not anymore.</p>

<p>7th amndment, trial by jury, when they took away any trial they took away the jury too</p>

<p>8th amendment, cruel and unusual punishment, because &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; makes torture so ok.</p>

<p>13th amendment, slavery - mind control victims are slaves</p>

Economically, globalism varies between free trade and lowering tariffs to Marxist proletarian internationalism. It is typically viewed as opposite of nationalism, and has become increasingly divisive in politics in many developed countries, such as the United States.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalism</a></p>

<p>Don&#39;t take my word for it. They admit to it themselves. </p>

<p>&quot;We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it. The only question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or consent.&quot; <strong>—Statement by Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member James Warburg to The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17th, l950</strong></p>

<p>&quot;We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries.&quot; <strong>--David Rockefeller, founder of the Trilateral Commission, in an address to a meeting of The Trilateral Commission, in June, 1991</strong> </p>

<p>&quot;Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an &quot;extraterrestrial&quot; invasion or Russians!!], whether real or promulgated [emphasis mine], that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.&quot; <strong>—Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberger Conference, Evians, France, 1991</strong></p>

<p>&quot;In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn&#39;t such a great idea after all.&quot; <strong>--Strobe Talbot, President Clinton&#39;s Deputy Secretary of State, as quoted in Time, July 20th, l992</strong></p>

<p>&quot;For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that&#39;s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.&quot; <strong>—David Rockefeller&#39;s Memoirs (Random House, New York, 2002)</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control.... Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent. <strong>—Congressman Larry P. McDonald, 1976, killed in the Korean Airlines 747 that was shot down by the Soviets</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical. What the Trilateral Commission intends is to create a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nationstates involved. As managers and creators of the system ,they will rule the future.&quot; <strong>—U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater in his l964 book: With No Apologies</strong></p>

<p>For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn&#39;t. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations-One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared &quot;ammunition&quot; in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support...... &quot;The UN is but a long-range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One-World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. &quot;The depression was the calculated &#39;shearing&#39; of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank. <strong>—Curtis Dall, FDR&#39;s son-in-law as quoted in his book, My Exploited Father-in-Law</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really.  Here&#39;s an example.  Let&#39;s say there&#39;s no borders anymore.  Anyone can move to any country.  Ireland has a population of 4.7 million.  India has a population of 1.3 billion.  India is largely poor.  Ireland is not.  Ireland&#39;s tiny population would get inundated by people from massive populations, like India.  </p>

<p>Sure, Irish people could move to India and spread their culture, but why would they want to?  And even if they did, there wouldn&#39;t be enough people for their culture to carry on in their own country, let alone somewhere else.  Ireland&#39;s culture would be eroded away to nothing in a matter of a couple short generations.  </p>

<p>Cultures are different because people are different.  Irish people have fair skin because Ireland doesn&#39;t get much sun.  People with darker skin are more likely to suffer depression in this type of climate.  People with fair skin are more likely to get skin cancer in a hotter climate.  At culinary school, people learn that different ethnic people have different palates.  This is genetic.  There&#39;s a reason food in the UK is known for being bland.  The people from that part of the world don&#39;t like heavily spiced food.  This is typical of people from climates with less sun.  The breeds of livestock, herbs and vegetables, clothing, music, all evolved together over thousands of years.  This is culture.  If new cultures and societies could just be mixed together to create new cultures, then there wouldn&#39;t be racial tension everywhere in the world where people of differing ethnicities and religions are mixed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried pretty hard to find a source and I can&#39;t find one.  It seems all the studies done on tolerance of spicy foods have been on only Caucasian people, I have no idea why.  I can&#39;t imagine it being due solely to nurture, because even if you take people of different ethnicities who all grow up in the US and have access to all different types of foods, those with fair skin will tend to like less spicy foods, and those who are from places closer to the equator will tend to prefer spicier foods.</p>

<p>There are always exceptions.  There&#39;s plenty of fair skinned people who love hot sauce, and plenty of black people who hate spicy foods, but the genetic component seems to be there.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s been studies showing that 70% of Caucasians have a gene that prevents them from tasting the bitter unpleasant component of kale and arugula.  This may be why black Americans joke about white people loving kale.  To 70% of us, its pretty good.  To nearly all of black people, its disgusting.</p>

<p>or maybe it&#39;s because of the unique quirks of human beings that has caused all this as we have advanced technologically.  maybe a society of a highly evolved version of elephants would be a different structure.  or a highly evolved version of crows.  or octopuses.  perhaps the unique quirks of each species, if combined with big brains, would create a different global societal structure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This does not remotely change the fact that you said it wasn&#39;t political activism, but it is a blatantly and wholly nationalistic. If you are framing nationalism as a solution to globalization, your vision is honestly less valuable and less meaningful than the elites you are quoting. The expressed concept that &quot;We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it,&quot; is more important and more real than any cockamamie visions of nation-states. </p>

<p>If you frame globalization as the enemy, you&#39;ve rendered yourself obsolete. The sheer fact of the matter is that there was a time before nation-states and there is going to be a time after them, and a political agenda based around trying to stave off globalized power and exploitation in favor of national power and exploitation is useless. We shall have a world government, whether we like it or not, because we are increasingly a global society, and that&#39;s honestly more good than bad. The ruling classes of a postnational world are a terrible foe, but no more terrible than the ruling classes of a westphalian world. </p>

<p>As ever, the only hope for humanity is a seizing of power away from these parasitic classes, and a deliberate and democratic restructuring of the economy in favor of all people. There was a time before high finance, before capitalist production, before bank ownership of the world, before the current enforced economic order, and there will be a time after, and we will create that time after together or it will be the end of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s quite a limiting perspective. To explain the actions of the elite by demonic possession and that their goal is that people go to hell is a Christian perspective. The fact is that human consciousness is one of the biggest mysteries there is. Saying the elite are possessed by a demon is simple but how could you be so sure? Maybe it&#39;s a higher dimensional creature, maybe they are spirits from previous ancestors, maybe it&#39;s aliens, maybe there is some highly classified technology that penetrates the consciousness , maybe it&#39;s all the same concept but different words for expressing that there is some external energy manipulating the elite or maybe there is no such thing and it&#39;s just internal motivations, self interest and lack of empathy. </p>

<p>There are of course many cults and spiritual beliefs including luciferianism, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the elite are all united in their belief and worship.
I do think there is a higher than average amount of pedophilia in the higher echelons of society and perhaps even cults which practice these kinds of things as rituals. And I think that&#39;s disgusting like most people do. Even Christianity isn&#39;t safe from this. </p>

<p>I think everybody should build a good moral compass and be able to love themselves and the people around them. Spiritual teachings provide a framework for these things. But I don&#39;t believe that God can be found in one book. God is universal and can be found everywhere. I&#39;m not even sure if there can be such thing as a devil or an opposite of god and think god is all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re perspective is limited if you assume a Christian perspective is automatically wrong or a product of indoctrination since I didn&#39;t believe in God/Jesus/the Bible/Lucifer until I spent over a decade researching. I&#39;m sure because if many reasons. If I name one or two or ten you&#39;ll say that&#39;s not enough but I&#39;m not willing to write a thesis right now. It&#39;s based on more than Reddit will allow me to type in ten comments. If I did write ten comments you&#39;ll say I haven&#39;t proven it true since I can&#39;t back up my experiences with physical evidence-although I took a photo that has a demon face in it. If you saw it you&#39;d say it was a digital artifact and not anything real. </p>

<p>So this is not the forum to prove anything to people. It&#39;s a place to share conclusions or experiences  but to convince someone of my point of view is impossible. You have to do the research yourself. But you already are basing your conclusion that my irrespective is limited in assumptions based on main stream media s stereotypes about Christians being gullible and simpleminded/closed-minded/brainwashed.  I already explained in a previous comment that I was agnostic for thirty years before concluding Jesus/Lucifer were real but you didn&#39;t read the whole comment or thread. </p>

<p>You&#39;re whole comment is based on the premise that I didn&#39;t do much research. It&#39;s based on assumptions. Your logic is flawed. You are the one who didn&#39;t do enough research if you think pedophilia is no more prevalent in elite circles. Ive already considered and investigated the other possibilities you mentioned. I constantly test all my beliefs and theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly I didn&#39;t say that the Christian perspective is wrong, I would admit I&#39;m quite ignorant when it comes to Christianity and perhaps should read the Bible sometime. That said I&#39;ve also done quite some research in many areas, including symbolism and numerology. I know about the monster energy logo representing 666 in Hebrew and there are indeed quite a lot of logos which contain mystical (sometimes satanic) symbols, yet symbols can be interpreted in multiple ways and it can be debated whether such symbols are deliberately chosen or just used because they look cool and edgy. You turn 6363 into 666 very selectively by adding the last 3 to the middle 3 which doesn&#39;t mean anything with such way of thinking you can literately find 666 or any other number for that matter everywhere. That demon face also doesn&#39;t really strike me and just looks like a case of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pareidolia/">pareidolia</a>.</p>

<p>That site about aliens and Christianity is interesting but it&#39;s just anecdotes and Christian interpretation of what aliens are. That your beliefs helps you with your sleep paralysis is a wonderful thing but still doesn&#39;t mean anything. To say I base my conclusion on mainstream media stereotypes is easy to say but I don&#39;t consume that much mainstream media. I read that you where agnostic for thirty years but that doesn&#39;t mean anything other than that you felt that you needed to. I myself have considered to make the as Soren Kierkegaard put it &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, but haven&#39;t because I think it&#39;s intellectually lazy. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much research you have done. I just said that I think that your conclusion comes from a limited perspective. You seem really defensive, you say that my comment is based on assumptions but you do the same. You didn&#39;t correctly read my comment because I said that I think there is a higher than average amount of pedophilia happening in elite circles.</p>

<p>Wow 9/11 must have been really personal to you if you&#39;ve worked at WTC.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the interview of Ronald Bernard it&#39;s indeed shocking, the only problem I have with the interview is that it&#39;s just anecdotal. He doesn&#39;t even says at which bank he worked and there is no evidence to be found that he indeed worked in the financial sector. </p>

<p>Again I haven&#39;t read the bible and probably should, but I think that you&#39;ve just become intellectually lazy and think you know it all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s endless evidence to back up my theory. Everything checks out whenever I analyze something new. It&#39;s so obvious what&#39;s going on.
I would recommend to check out Robert Anton Wilson and Discordianism, also read The Holographic Universe which might give you a framework to explain paranormal activities in an other way. Anyway I wish you the best of luck and may god be with us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m defensive because you are dismissive of my conclusions based on my lack of convincing evidence even though you provide no convincing evidence for your beliefs. I&#39;m also defensive because you continued to dismiss my conclusions in spite of my pointing out that I have not attempted to provide all the evidence here. So it doesn&#39;t make any sense that you keep dismissing my points as unproven when you haven&#39;t seen the evidence. What are you basing your conclusions about my claims on? You use a lot of generic arguments that I&#39;ve seen before from others who pretend that I&#39;m supposed to convince them in s comment and that they themselves don&#39;t have to meet any standards of evidence in their conclusions. You can&#39;t have it both ways. If no one is allowed to share an opinion on Reddit without providing a thesis to back it up than that includes you, too. Where&#39;s your thesis? Shall I dismiss each of your points as you do mine and say you haven&#39;t backed it up enough to convince me therefore you are wrong on every point? </p>

<p>As your link describes, Pareidolia (/pærɪˈdoʊliə/ parr-i-DOH-lee-ə) is a psychological phenomenon in which the mind responds to a stimulus, usually an image or a sound, by perceiving a familiar pattern where none exists (e.g., in random data).</p>

<p>How is a reptilian face a familiar pattern to me? I&#39;d never seen a reptilian before and didn&#39;t expect to see one looking back at me from a rear view mirror. It was months later that I saw a movie with reptilians in it that made me take a second look at that photo which I initially blew off my mind playing rocks on me. </p>

<p>Numerology is done in code. Therefore if a secret society wants to use it to embed 666 in something, they won&#39;t want to make it obvious. You claim you know numerology yet you think the final number represented is supposed to be what appears to the viewer. How is that secretive? If 666 is blatantly written everywhere, his are they supposed to explain that it&#39;s not luciferianism behind corporate branding? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a line from a page about <a href="https://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/01/11-examples/">Numerology. </a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami – supposedly “the deadliest tsnunami ever” – occurred on 12/26.   1+2+2+6 = 11.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t know that numbers can be addded together in numerology, 3 and 6 are the top numbers used in luciferianism. Also, the context of the numbers implies that it is meant to represent 666 since the decal has 666 and the plate says &quot;666 it&quot; if you add the threes up. &quot;666 it&quot; is easy to decide since it&#39;s common to 666 a corporate logo by embedding luciferian symbolism in it. </p>

<p>Anecdotal evidence is evidence. Modern medicine and psychology rely on testimonies. What does your doctor base his testing on if not your complaints? What does a therapist base a diagnosis on if not your testimony? Jesus&#39; name ending sleep paralysis is repeatable, testable, falsifiable and observable. I was able to repeat other people&#39;s experiences with my own sleep paralysis. If I was in a lab the choking and paralysis could be observed. My suddenly coming out if it by saying jesus&#39; name would be shown in the fact that I stopped choking. It can be tested with other methods of ending the paralysis to see if anything else works. The creatures seen in sleep paralysis are the sane creatures seen according to testimonies of many others and the sane demons described for thousands of years. It&#39;s noteworthy. You can&#39;t prove a theory right. You can only prove it wrong. scientific theories are based on assumptions and unproven. Half get proven false within ten years according to my biology professor and the percentage varies between 40-50% in my research. Science is agnostic in its stance in the supernatural. It can&#39;t test the supernatural. But it can use testimony to form theories. My theory that sleep paralysis is frequently a demonic attack and that jesus&#39; name can end it is backed by thousands of testimonies and that is valid evidence. It doesn&#39;t prove it true since nothing can be proven true in logic, but it hasn&#39;t been proven false either. So there&#39;s no valid reason to dismiss it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question is, where do Trump supporters stand on this issue?  Do they seriously think Trump is an anti-globalist when he clearly said after he bombed Syria that he&#39;s both a Globalist and a Nationalist.  You can&#39;t be both in my opinion, unless you&#39;re a Nationalist first, then just good at diplomacy second.</p>

<p>Trump is ready to go on all out nuclear war against NK and didn&#39;t think twice about bombing Syria and doing an actual investigation into the gas attack first.  From what I&#39;ve read NK, Syria, and Iran are some of the only few countries left in the world no controlled by a central Rothschilds bank.  If Trump is attacking those countries, I think that&#39;s a clear indication that he&#39;s a globalist.  Yet some Trumper&#39;s still manage to think Trump is some kind of genius and is playing 8d chess against the deep state.  Now do they seriously believe that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I think Alex Jones is a disinfo agent.  They&#39;ve given no reason, that I know of, to prove that he&#39;s playing 8d chess or that he&#39;s just going along with the globalist plan so he can later take them down.  That doesn&#39;t make any sense.  The country is even more divided than it was before.  </p>

<p>I actually gave Trump a chance but I see no sign that he has the people&#39;s best interest at heart.  I can see how people are deceived, when Trump fights the media; because the media does lie to us.  But it&#39;s like Trump uses that to his advantage and riles people up on his side against the media, keeping division up.  Why can&#39;t we have another president like JFK, who actually appears to have the people&#39;s best interest at heart?</p>

<p>The elites being at the top is definitely wrong.</p>

<p>And yet all countries uniting is the best thing for humanity tbh. I dont see any downsides?</p>

<p>On the other hand elites already have control over us ( One may control a country other may control a continent) but if Globalisation happens they all will have to give up power towards a single entity though. (Which is probably why there&#39;s a divide among elites but one side is weaker of course.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all depends on how  society,  power and the rule of law is managed. We could have global governance in a totalitarian way. If we centralize all power to one single global government, that would be bad because of the disconnect between that power and the differences between individual communities. This would probably never happen. </p>

<p>The thing with global governance is that everybody have to comply whether it&#39;s the debt based money system, copyright law, human rights, etc. and how would such a government act when a sovereign nation doesn&#39;t comply. Would there be a world police? How do we make sure that everything happens democratically? </p>

<p>Also progression doesn&#39;t always mean good. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve read 1984 and Brave New World (if you haven&#39;t please do) but they would give you enough reasons how a big controlling government (although not global) could progress to create a obedient mass of people with the illusion of freedom.</p>

I just say im more of a skeptic than a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; because I do believe theres something big and evil going on but I would never go deep like how I do believe the globalist are satanist who perform sacrifices. If i ever brought that up with someone who isn&#39;t open to such topics  I would surely lose some credibility AND friends.</p>

<p>I would disagree with this. Everyone has a common goal of satisfying their wants and needs. In our current paradigm, this correlates pretty significantly with needing to make more money, but that&#39;s just the way society has organized itself. And particularly, that current form of debt-backed money most of the world uses means it&#39;s always easier for someone with money to make more of it than someone without it. </p>

<p>There is no way to punch through their programming. Watch &quot;Deception was my job&quot; interview with Yuri Bezmenov, in the end he tells exactly how these people were made and how they think. Most of them are unable to see the truth.</p>

<p>I personally think that the collapse of society as we know it is inevitable. Universe works in cycles and we&#39;re heading downwards yet again.</p>

<p>It&#39;s because a lot of people got the the &quot;freedom&quot; and something given had no value. So they will make a hell for a of us and many upcoming generations, until next struggle to pull all up happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pedophilia and ritual sacrifice are real things that have happened and are still happening to this day (the later might seem a bit outdated). Of course not every person who is considered part of the elite does such things but there are multiple instances where that&#39;s the case. Human trafficking for example requires a huge coordinated effort. I like a lot of people went through the conspiracy rabbit hole and there are a lot of wild claims made online but pedophilia in elite circles isn&#39;t as far fetched as it seems.</p>

<p>What saddens me is that you feel like you aren&#39;t able to discuss your views because you see something you think is a laughing matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With respect, I don&#39;t think this is the &#39;BIG conspiracy, the only conspiracy that matters&#39;</p>

<p>The biggest conspiracy is our programmed beliefs about the fundamental nature of the reality we are currently experiencing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to get bogged down and depressed about the Satanic &#39;Elite&#39; that are running the planet and enslaving us but to be honest, I think this is a distraction to keep us in a negative state.</p>

<p>We should be asking the BIG questions. e.g. </p>

<p>What is the fundamental nature of reality? </p>

<p>Is the universe really just matter in motion, or is it a dream/simulation/maya? </p>

<p>Why are having this experience? </p>

<p>Why did we incarnate here? </p>

<p>Did we incarnate by choice? </p>

<p>if this is a school, are we attending class willingly, like a university, or are we children being forced to school by our parents for our &#39;own good&#39;? </p>

<p>Or is there a more sinister reason that we are experiencing life on this planet?</p>

<p>These questions concern me far more than the satanic pedophiles that control us because they are probably NPCs anyway.</p>

<p>Treat this like a game. If this reality is virtual and we didn&#39;t choose to be here, then how do we escape?</p>

<p>Liberation is the only game in town.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the feeling.  You can&#39;t make everyone believe or see the conspiracy that&#39;s going on.  You have to be an idiot and love lies or be completely delusional not to see something is wrong with the world.  Sometimes ignorance is bliss, but once you wake up it&#39;s hard to go back.  I don&#39;t know if youre a spiritual person or anything but it&#39;s good to take a break from the conspiracy stuff every once in a while.  You have to believe in a Higher Power and realise everything is in His hands (and I&#39;m not talking about Satan).  So knowing that there really isn&#39;t anything you can do to change all the evil in the world is reality.  But you can have peace knowing that everything is ultimately in God&#39;s hands.</p>

<p>But there is a true, BIG conspiracy of our time. It is this-- the current president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, was installed by a Putin-directed operation that has been in the works since at least 2006. All of the evidence has come out. The only remaining question is whether or not our President was a knowing and willing participant in the operation.</p>

<p>Some people can be convinced and some can&#39;t. Help where you can but don&#39;t cast your pearls before swine. And keep yourself strong goddamnit. </p>

<p>If you want to WIN you have to realize you&#39;re the infantry in this war. If you want to add weight to your arguments and make the biggest difference then embody the right way to live. And don&#39;t just do it for others, do it for yourself.</p>

<p>Love you, family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really is. People bait each other into arguments that don&#39;t even matter, and at the end of the day are just wastes of energy and time. So many people ready to defend and assert their position as left or right, when so few of them realize that they&#39;ve been had - caught up in left vs right ideology - caught up in human RACES and not just the <strong>human race</strong>. We are one - no matter our ideology or race - we are the human race. I want so badly for those people to wake up and see the big picture, but so many of them are looking at a portion of the truth as the whole truth. Sadly, I don&#39;t know if we can fix this. I want to believe in us, but at the same time, I am worried the damage is too much and the division is too great. No one is open-minded anymore, or open enough to entertain new ideas - especially ones that don&#39;t line up with their political ideology or philosophy. It makes me sad - I want us to unite. At the end of the day, I feel as though it will never happen. When the time comes, friends, that we face danger and a one-world government.. I hope you are all safe and drop your strongly held ideas to unite with one another.. I know I will try. Good luck to all of you when that time comes, friends.</p>

<p>I would disagree with this. Everyone has a common goal of satisfying their wants and needs. In our current paradigm, this correlates pretty significantly with needing to make more money, but that&#39;s just the way society has organized itself. And particularly, that current form of debt-backed money most of the world uses means it&#39;s always easier for someone with money to make more of it than someone without it. </p>

However I think we are already a part of a hidden global government controlled by a foreign central bank.  I mean the USD is the largest global currency.  And our military has the most global intervention.  And Trump looks like he&#39;s ramping up global tensions even more.  I don&#39;t see the pendulum swinging back very far to nationalism. When the president starts talking about fire and fury and totally destroying a country that is not controlled by a Rothschilds central bank, like we are, I think that&#39;s a problem.</p>
