        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On it&#39;s face some of the facts don&#39;t really hold much water in my opinion.  Let me preference this by saying as a voter who votes based off foreign policy and integrity, I didn&#39;t vote of either Hillary or Trump.  I&#39;m just skeptical of this news, and here&#39;s some of the issues I see with this story:</p>

<p>1) According to FB and the reports I have read, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-facebook-trump-and-russia/">the majority of the propaganda was in 2015</a>, a full year before the election.</p>

<p>2) Why would Trump have Russia pay 100k to manipulate FB in 2015, when he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/trump-campaign-pays-millions-overseas-big-data-firm-n677321">paid UK based Cambridge Analytics $5 million to target voters</a>?  Also, does no one have issue with a foreign company influencing our elections?</p>

<p>3) The media expects me to believe 100k in FB propaganda from Russia in 2015 had more of an impact than the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?cycle=2016&amp;amp;strID=C00578997">$9 million to CTR</a> and the $5 million from Cambridge Analytics.  </p>

<p>4) The main reason Hillary didn&#39;t win was because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/technology/facebook-russian-ads.html?mcubz=1">she failed in large city&#39;s like Detroit, Cleveland, and Milwaukee that were in swing states</a>.  Was that propaganda in 2015 able to still have an influence on voters in those regions a year later?</p>

<p>5) Lastly, I&#39;d be interested in seeing the propaganda that was used.  Does anyone have examples of what was actually pushed, like screen shots so we can take a look?  I have seen it described, but have yet to see the actual posts that were used.</p>

<p>The reason I question this is because of the new McCarthyism I see everyday.  Like I said I don&#39;t like Trump, I think he&#39;s no better than Bush or Obama on foreign policy at this point.  </p>

<p>1) Russia has been honing their information warfare ability since at least 2013. And for it to be effective, it has to be a continuous effort, during non-election years.</p>

<p>Do you have any source to back this up?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) Before last week, if you trusted Facebook on this Russia paid $0. This is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they wait 9-10 months for these new revelations, but re-framed from doing so before.  That also makes me question the validity of the claims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3) You seem very confused about how the propaganda campaign works. The $100K was to seed social media. From there, their army of bots and trolls amplified the message. This article explains it well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, a 100 in seeding propaganda a year prior doesn&#39;t seem like it would have that big of an impact.  Have you actually seen the propaganda that was pushed?  It would make things a lot easier to understand if I could see what was pushed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4) Hillary being a flawed candidate has absolutely nothing, ZERO, to do with whether or not Russia interfered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So he lose is blamed on Russian interference, but her flaws as a candidate has nothing to do with her lose?  Now I&#39;m confused.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5) Google fake news during 2016 election. My facebook feed was full of bullshit like Pope endorsed Trump. There are plenty of documented examples that can be traced back to RT/Sputnik.</p>

<p>That was during 2016, the majority of it took place in 2015.  Also, as much as I hate the term &quot;fake news&quot; it was everywhere in the US media as well.  It&#39;s a rampant issue not with just RT &amp; Sputnik, but in all facets of today&#39;s journalism. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t bother me that much, it happens.  I was a big Thom Hartmann fan and he&#39;s on RT.  Hell, RT&#39;s line up is pretty good.  They have <a href="https://www.rt.com/shows/">Jesse Ventura, Ed Shultz, Mike Papantonio, Larry King</a>, so it doesn&#39;t bother me when reporters go over to another Russian state news.  I just assume the amount of propaganda I receive here in the states is just as much if not more than I would get from RT or Sputnik.  </p>

<p>Great article and Breitbart is horrible, I completely agree.  In fact I&#39;m more than willing to say fake news as a whole had a large impact in general on this election. Groups like breitbart/infowars and the like all have there hands in this kind of stuff, and on the flip side, you had ton of stories made up about Trump as well. Although I think there are racists who support trump, most of the stories about trump supporters burning churches or attacking people turned out to be faked (maybe not all, but there was a large amount).  Even the story where they reported the Vermont Power grid was taken down by Russian hackers would be an example where I see this red scare tactic being used.  Fake news in the media isn&#39;t what I&#39;m arguing, the Russia propaganda through social media and it&#39;s influence is what I&#39;m doubting.  Just so we&#39;re clear, I&#39;m not a fan of Russia at all, but I&#39;m very skeptical of stories that affect our foreign policy, especially when it was so clear there were so many other influences besides Russian trolls.  </p>

<p>if it was true that refugees were raping and pillaging and high fiving over the deed it would be reasonable to want to protect yourself.

<p>What? Do you mean the story that accurately reported claims made by officials that computers belonging to Vermont Power had been compromised by malicious Russian software? You think a few local officials not knowing how computers work and making idiotic statements to the media somehow is the same as an entire propaganda industry deliberately lying to millions of people every day?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no “penetration of the U.S. electricity grid.” The truth was undramatic and banal. Burlington Electric, after receiving a Homeland Security notice sent to all U.S. utility companies about the malware code found in the DNC system, searched all its computers and found the code in a single laptop that was not connected to the electric grid.</p>

<p><strong>Apparently, the Post did not even bother to contact the company before running its wildly sensationalistic claims</strong>, so Burlington Electric had to issue its own statement to the Burlington Free Press, which debunked the Post’s central claim (emphasis in original): “We detected the malware in a single Burlington Electric Department laptop NOT connected to our organization’s grid systems.”</p>

<p>He was perceived as bad for the brand; in other words it was believed that he would detract more from from audiences across the network than he brought to the network.</p>

<p>MSNBC has broader concerns than the ratings for a single hour of television 5 times a week.   </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which was perceived as bad for the brand because MSNBC has more concerns than a single hour of television 5 days a week.  You&#39;re not making the point you hope to make here - you&#39;re just coming across as having never put much thought into the concerns of a content producer who has to produce content and pull an audience for many more hours than a mere one a day on merely 5 days of the week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a regular at r/politics, I&#39;m not surprised you aren&#39;t aware of this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find arguing by links all too often is the first resort of someone who cannot make an argument so just hopes if they post enough links no one will notice they don&#39;t actually support what they&#39;re trying to say, but I&#39;ll give you enough benefit of the doubt to try the first one....</p>

<p>And you didn&#39;t deserve that benefit because the first link is an instance of a &quot;real attack that the media reported which the perpetrator tried to place blame on others for&quot; exactly as I suspected and suggested in my earlier post.  I don&#39;t accept this is a competency thing.  No one is so stupid they cannot distinguish between the media not doing their job honestly or competently and the media not solving a crime between when they become aware of the police reports and getting the story published.  You are arguing in bad faith.  No one is so stupid they actually think the media is at fault for a criminal&#39;s attempts to frame others for their crime.  That&#39;s just fucking absurd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no “penetration of the U.S. electricity grid.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And determining that is the job of those responsible for that and it&#39;s not the media.  Equally, issuing public statements on behalf of the entity responsible for monitoring access to the electricity is not the media&#39;s job.  Their job is to report on such statements.  You are trying to make a case that because some officials involved with the electricity grid don&#39;t know what the fuck they&#39;re talking about, therefore &quot;something something media&quot; which is absurd and frankly too stupid for me to believe an honest mistake is being made.  When someone makes a public statement, they&#39;re responsible for the content of that statement, not whoever reports that they said it.  This is taking shooting the messenger far too far for me to believe you really believe what you&#39;re what arguing.  Stretching doesn&#39;t even come into it.</p>

<p>And again, the equivalency you&#39;re trying to make is to someone literally and knowingly making up lies and publishing them as news.  That&#39;s beyond pathetic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not really, depends if your not willing to look. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, really and if it were really otherwise why present these pathetic arguments that attempt to make that point by equating literally knowingly making up lies and publishing them as news with accurately reporting the police&#39;s currently publicly released information about unsolved crimes that the perpetrator was later found to have tried to pin on someone else?  There are not enough words for how fucking absurd it is to try to pretend those two things are remotely equivalent.  One of them is willfully dishonest and malicious and the other is honestly going about the job the way it&#39;s supposed to be done.   Seems you don&#39;t know where to look to find any actual substance for your argument either.</p>

<p>One way to find out if the Trump campaign helped Internet Research Agency would be to compare the targeting criteria the campaign used on Facebook to the targeting criteria the Russian propagandists used. If both groups targeted the same audience, that&#39;s worth looking into. Investigators could do the same with any further suspicious accounts Facebook unearths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t see it as odd at all.  Russia, like other developed nations, seems to have been practicing cyber warfare for a while so why would it seem odd they&#39;d attempt to use Facebook to sow discord among their rivals?  It&#39;s a smart move and it&#39;s likely going to be repeated in some form very soon because they know it works.</p>

<p>As for the link, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>How did the Russians decide which Americans to target with the Facebook ads?</strong></p>

<p>The short answer is we don’t know. There are suspicions that the Russians might have had help from the Trump campaign or its allies. But the Russians may not have needed more than the targeting tools Facebook offers to every advertiser.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>makes it seem like they&#39;re not seriously entertaining the notion, but because it&#39;s likely a question some readers might ask about the article(which I&#39;m guessing why those parts are bolded) they threw the hypothetical out there.  I admit I&#39;ve only read a few articles on the subject, but the ones I&#39;ve read don&#39;t link the two parties in a collusion aspect.  More like Russia was trying to exploit some weakness they discovered, or were just practicing.  Then again, we could easily be inferring different things from the same words so maybe I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>There is that as well.  I personally think the argument that Russia influence the election through FB is a hard pill to swallow.  I could be wrong, but it looks to me like an excuse for Hillary&#39;s lose and a witch hunt/red scare all over again.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m will to accept they may have even run propaganda, I&#39;d like to see some evidence of what the propaganda was though.  Even so I still doubt it has the impact on the election as everyone is making it out to be, especially if it was in 2015.  </p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m not here to defend Trump or his supporters.  I grew up out East and have known he&#39;s a shit bag since I was 10.

<p>And I agree.  I don&#39;t think they were specifically and only targeting Trump, but instead a certain kind of demographic.  Had Trump done poorly early on, they would&#39;ve continued in a similar manner without his name but still targeting the same demographics.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As you should with any story.  I&#39;m skeptical of Trump campaign involvement in this, at least at the start, but I wouldn&#39;t be totally surprised that someone attached to the campaign(like Bannon) could have been involved quietly on their own.</p>

<p>I definitely wouldn&#39;t put it past them at all, but in general from what I saw, this Russian propaganda story as being one of the main influences on the election seems ridiculous to me.  The idea that Hillary is saying she lost because of weaponize fake news by Russia seems like a stretch to me, then this FB story on top seem like it&#39;s all propaganda (modern day red scare).  I personally think the Anthony Weiner laptop causing Comey to re-open the investigation into Hillary did more damage than anything else.  </p>

<p>That one (October 2016) was simply strike three. The first strike was the revelation of classified emails on a private server in March 2015. The most damaging, imo, was the second strike, the release of the hacked DNC emails in July 2016 just days prior to the charade that was the DNC convention.</p>
