    <div class="md"><p>Actually I recommend reading the Biofeedback section as it is very interesting. What they are suggesting is to create a healing intention/thought in the right brain and then objectively measuring the results (in the area to be healed) with scientific equipment. When there is a positive change in the readings, try to do the thing that &quot;worked&quot; again until there is a sort of muscle memory for it.</p>

If you go on the Cia reading room and type in Monrow Institute than youll get alot on how the CIA was into remote viewing and the monrow institute patented Binaural beats which can sync up hemispheres in the brain to apparently move your consciousness out of your body. You are nore than physical matter.</p>

Instead of just breathing, they teach you tools that can help you to be more focused and to be more conscious of your energy and the energy systems around you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They talk about have a resonate energy balloon which a field of energy you generate around you. This resonant energy balloon is related to a &quot;Merkabah&quot; in ancient judaism. The tapes start with a energy converison box which your supposed to put your worries and anxietys in so the meditations arent effected by your worries. Each tape teachs you something than adds on to it. There about 35 minutes long so its definitely more a meditation than the 10 minute guided meditations ive done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just like that and hunterxhunter is a great show. Nen is a synergy between the mind and body and the whole point of the hemi-sync tapes is to create a synergy between both hemispheres of the brain. Overall meditation does teach you to observe yourself as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had an experience about two months ago, and I astrally projected to Venus.  I&#39;ve known of astral projection, and I definitely listen to the right kinds of music for it, but geez, I did not plan for it nor was I expecting it.  I felt like I was &quot;braced&quot; right below my knees with almost zero pressure, and there was a feeling of motion I got that was a whisking glide...you can definitely feel the &quot;air&quot; as you go.  Not only that, but I saw a huge space station or spaceship on the way, fairly close to Venus...maybe even in orbit.  I got to the atmosphere and then awoke, so not much detail otherwise.  </p>

<p>The actual sensation of it is worth the practice meditating in general, that is for sure.  As far as mystical experiences go, that is definitely in my top five.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m probably the worst person to ask, because I seem to have little control of the goofy stuff that happens to me.  I listen to a lot of music in general in 432 Hz in earbuds.  Bands like Enigma, Air, A Perfect Circle, Mars Volta.  I mean, I think there&#39;s good music in virtually any genre.  I simply got as relaxed as possible, which for me is tough enough, and went to lie down with the absolute idea that I was not tired enough to go to sleep and that I would try as hard as possible to not think of anything...that&#39;s my big problem.  Still, I literally just laid down on my bed, starting drifting in about three minutes, and felt a slight quiver and then it started.  Also, it felt like it took ten minutes or so, but I was only out for five minutes.  I was able to recount what happened to my brother, who luckily was around at the time.  </p>

<p>I will also say that it felt like it almost happened a second time, but that time I got the body quiver but while conscious, and then nothing happened.  It was still a cool feeling.</p>

<p>I do drink coffee, and smoke cigarettes and &quot;otherwise&quot; pretty habitually, so there&#39;s that.  I don&#39;t think it matters much, but like I said, general meditation and thought about things helps.  I have been reading a fair amount about Venus and Lilith, so I&#39;m not so shocked that it was Venus I went to.  But I am still shocked that Lilith is an astronomical concept.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind that during the Cold War and probably still today a big counterintelligence technique employed by the US was to personally have intelligence agencies pursue crazy projects to plant disinfo for spies and to hide actual cutting edge projects amidst a storm of useless bullshit.</p>

<p>To me, this reads like exactly that, it&#39;s literally discussing biofeedback techniques aka &quot;Mind over matter&quot; (the idea that meditation/intense focus can magically defeat all ills and even aging lol). This idea had actually been pretty popular (in a more moderate sense) in the 60&#39;s, with a lot of pop-alt-medicine focusing on &quot;healing meditation&quot;. The document also describes the use of &quot;binaural beats&quot; which have been publicly available for ages and yet have been repeatedly been debunked for being any more useful that for guiding ordinary meditation.</p>

<p>A ton of the biological explanations for aspects of neuroscience like consciousness are also absurdly simplistic and pseudoscientific.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what makes sense to me. Remote viewing could have been a cover for satellite, spies, or drone technology back then. They&#39;ve probably had drones with cameras the size of flies for decades, and I heard somewhere that, for a long time, we had a satellite capable of telling if a quarter at the bottom of a pool is heads or tails. The Russians would find out about remote viewing and put wasted money into it because they would question why the CIA knows very specific things going on in their country. </p>

<p>It sounds crazy, and it may be, but this was an extensive program researched by the CIA at one time. They had a full system of syncranizing the resonating electrical field produced from the brain, to techniques of tapping into the em field of the earth to use it as a channel for mental/psycic communication. Also many remote viewing projects with sketch&#39;s.</p>

<p>Not sure what to make of it but I&#39;ve researched alot of stuff from the Stargate project, and it&#39;s facsinating to say the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I recommend reading the Biofeedback section as it is very interesting. What they are suggesting is to create a healing intention/thought in the right brain and then objectively measuring the results (in the area to be healed) with scientific equipment. When there is a positive change in the readings, try to do the thing that &quot;worked&quot; again until there is a sort of muscle memory for it.</p>
