        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is it just me or do the mods give zero fucks now? Something is wrong in the new section of this sub. Is it brigading? Upvote downvote bots? New accounts shilling for the msm narrative? New accounts mucking up discussions? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been seeing a lot of well thought out comments only to get downvoted to hell for expressing the very themes (occultism, tbtb, HRC corruption, 9/11, etc) this sub has become known to discuss. Is it TopMinds posting shit to get a response? Or have too many people migrated from other subs to muddy the community here. Whatever it is, this sub is divided and the mods have done nothing to help that. </p>

<p>This used to be a place where partisan politics were understood to be a driving force for division; it was more or less understood. Now it is turning this place into a bitch fest with little to no constructive thought and a lot of skepticism towards actual conspiracy related content. Skepticism is good, I admit, but the downright dismissiveness of many of the new users is troubling. </p>

<p>Mods, what the fuck is going on?</p>

<p>Edit: thank you u/liverpoolwin for saying it down below; if anybody doesn&#39;t believe me, check the new queue at regular intervals and you&#39;ll see what I&#39;m talking about.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with asking for proof can be illustrated by a story....  this happened about 12 years ago.    </p>

<p>got into an argument over 9/11 being an inside job.  I start talking about how they used thermite to bring down the buildings.<br/>
&quot;bob&quot; says &quot;Thermite isn&#39;t an explosive, its an incendiary.  you can&#39;t use it to bring a building down&quot;.<br/>
This is where my research started.  Found a patent for using thermate (a kind of thermite) in demolition cutter charges.<br/>
Bob questions the authenticity of the document.  I point out that I hotlinked to the USPTO website.
Bob then says &quot;That&#39;s just a patent.  there are millions of those for devices that never get built.&quot;<br/>
So now, more research.  I found a video made by Controlled Demolition Inc.. (do not see this video up anymore, but probably still exists within 9/11 truth documentaries....  unless CDI DCMA&#39;d them).  It was a marketing video, showing them bringing down a steel frame bridge using thermite cutters, exactly like the one I found a patent of.<br/>
Bob says &quot;that&#39;s just a marketing video, that doesn&#39;t mean anything.&quot;<br/>
I point out that it&#39;s a marketing video in which they ACTUALLY TAKE DOWN A STEEL FRAMED STRUCTURE WITH THERMITE, proving that he is wrong in saying that thermite is not used in demolition.  I further point out that thermite cutters leave beams cut at 45 degree angles, and pools of molten metal, both of which were seen in the aftermath of the WTC attack.<br/>
Bob says he&#39;s never seen any evidence of steel beams cut at 45 degree angles, or any pools of molten metal.<br/>
time for some more research.<br/>
Posted 2 pictures.  One of the immediate aftermath of the collapse, with many beams sticking out cut at 45 degree angles.  One of a backhoe pulling a beam out of smoking rubble, with globs of molten metal dripping off of its 45 degree cut end.<br/>
Bob says &quot;those could be pictures of anything.  You SAY they&#39;re of the world trade center, but I don&#39;t see anything identifiable in the background to determine what these are even pictures of&quot;.<br/>
I point out that I hotlinked to FEMA&#39;s website.  I gave the link to the page in their 9/11 section that these pictures appeared in.<br/>
Bob suggested that the pictures were probably from months later, when they started using torches to cut up the beams and haul them away.<br/>
I pointed out that the pictures are dated on the FEMA page I linked.  I also pointed out that it wouldn&#39;t make sense to cut at 45 degrees, as that would be a longer length to cut.  You&#39;d cut the shortest length, 90 degrees.  45 degree cut only makes sense in controlled demo, where the beams have to slide over and down, which a 90 degree cut would prevent.<br/>
Bob asked me &quot;How do you know, are you a welder?!&quot;      </p>

<p>For a moment, I considered doing some more research to prove what seemed to me to be common sense...  But I realized the futility.  I don&#39;t even think his question made sense.  I had spent HOURS, across a few days, proving what seemed obvious, and this obnoxious twat had spent probably 30 seconds dismissively replying.    </p>

<p>I posted back &quot;PROVE THE SKY IS BLUE, NIGGA!&quot;<br/>
He of course replied with a picture of the sky.  I said &quot;How do I know that&#39;s Earth....  I don&#39;t see anything identifiable in the picture.&quot;<br/>
From there of course, it was all insults.  I&#39;m crazy.  I&#39;m a conspiracy theorists.  Do I pick up the FBI&#39;s transmissions in my fillings?  I need to adjust my tinfoil hat.<br/>
And as soon as the &quot;debate&quot; had been &quot;won&quot; by my opponent, everyone else had to pile on with the ridicule.</p>

<p>This is why I say &quot;FUCK YOU!&quot; to anyone who asks me to provide proof.  It&#39;s there if you want to find it, but you don&#39;t.  You just want to waste my time until I get sick of your little game, then ridicule me for losing.  Fuck off.    </p>

<p>.    </p>

<p>SIDE NOTE:  I spent a few minutes searching, and can&#39;t find either the patent, or video I mentioned above.  I guess google says they don&#39;t exist anymore.  Just like how google keeps telling me thermite doesn&#39;t exist when spellcheck keeps suggesting &quot;termite&quot;.  Fuck you google.</p>

<p>The world is full of people like your &quot;Bob&quot; - some of which are just assholes that are proud of their arrogant ignorance, and <strong><em>others</em></strong> who are on a MISSION - especially when it comes to certain topics that are of &quot;INTEREST&quot; to them. The latter will not only flatly deny and insult you, they will send you off on seeming &quot;wild-goose chases&quot;, they will also LIE THEIR ASSES OFF - repeatedly regurgitating the same shit, even when they&#39;ve had their faces rubbed in it multiple times. </p>

<p>These are the hard-core ideologues - they don&#39;t give a SHIT about what is true or false or &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;,  - they tell lies as naturally as they breathe. All they care about is WINNING, and for them that means that THEIR perceived interests prevail over &quot;the opposition&quot;, and there is ZERO moral compunction against &quot;dirty pool&quot; in their mindset.</p>

<p>THE GOOD NEWS is that when these fuckers deny and lie and ask for &quot;PROOF!!!&quot;, you start to <strong><em>research</em></strong>, and pretty soon you start to learn where to look (and where NOT to look), and you begin uncovering amazing facts about history and politics and <em>whatever</em> that you likely would have NEVER FOUND had it not been for these LYING ASSHOLES dismissing and challenging you at every point.</p>

<p>So after a while, you begin to compile a stock of irrefutable information from impeccable sources, then the pieces start falling together... Amazing.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s the trick: DO NOT expect the assholes you have been debating to back down or to <em>accept</em> any information you&#39;ve uncovered - that is NOT going to happen, because they aren&#39;t interested in facts or truth - <em>they never have been</em>. Their goal is to pimp <em>their</em> agenda to serve <em>their</em> interests, so in most cases, they will respond by simply dismissing or belittling your sources, no matter how original or authoritative, OR they will double-down by impugning your &quot;motives&quot; for researching such matters - launching ad hominem attacks, etc.</p>

<p>THAT, friend, is when you know you are moving in the right direction. Their level of anger and HATRED directed toward you is the best measure that you are moving in the right direction.</p>

<p>When you write, answering these ideologically-driven ignoramuses, remember that you are NOT addressing THEM, but OTHERS who might be following the conversational debate. </p>

<p>So your goal should NEVER be to convince the &quot;Bobs&quot; of the world, that isn&#39;t going to happen. Your goal should be to use the denial and the lies that the &quot;Bobs&quot; throw at you as springboards for further research, the fruits of which will not only enrich your own understanding, but educate, enlighten and edify the &quot;silent readers&quot; who lurk in the background.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Don&#39;t take things personally, or let the ASSHOLES get under your skin. If you play it right, these caustic bastards can &quot;help&quot; you to get an education that NO amount of money could buy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know that skeptic community folks suffer from an age old problem. It is the pride of the snobby egg head. Lots of us have been there before. I have been there. I mean no offense. It is really hard for very bright and very analytical people to call bullshit when they cannot cleanly follow through a problem.</p>

<p>There is an issue though. Not everything can be easily deduced like a math equation or a physics theorem. Sometimes there are topics where many holes exist and there is very little evidence, and most of it is circumstantial. Often these topics deal heavily in psychology, and many times also deal in morals and ethics. Sometimes you have to infer things, and even make hunches. This is not the best way of analyzing a problem, but sadly this is all we have sometimes. Problem with some skeptic types is they take joy in shooting down topics they only know on a surface level. It makes sense, because it is fun to challenge yourself and prove somebody else wrong.</p>

<p>Often though many skeptics think they have proven something false, or something patently silly, when they never even gave it a chance. When you ask them to have an open mind, they pull out and completely ruin that good Carl Sagan quote. </p>

<p>Come on man. You know as well as I do that skeptic types carry their own baggage. You do not have to be so coy about it.</p>

<p>Even your comment, &#39;instead of plainly accepting them,&#39; is loaded. Often &#39;debate&#39; of the topic itself never happens because too many people come in to &#39;debate&#39; whether it&#39;s an allowable or legitimate topic to debate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny that my quote didn&#39;t say that asking for evidence is shutting people down. I&#39;m surprised you still had the gall to pretend it did (jk I&#39;m not surprised). </p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to want to address the things I&#39;m saying about the difficulty of finding evidence about conspiracy theories. Further, what constitutes &#39;evidence&#39; can mean different things to different people, especially on a sub such as this. </p>

<p>Do you not understand this, or is it just easier to repeat the same talking points by ignoring it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone just assumes everyone elses&#39; theories are 100% true all day? Wouldn&#39;t that be boring?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sure would be. Good thing I&#39;m not advocating for that. I&#39;m not sure that reductio ad absurdum works on straw man claims, but kudos to you for trying. </p>

<p>Now I want you to read this slowly, because while I think it&#39;s a simple concept to understand, you seem to be (intentionally?) struggling with it:</p>

<p>It is possible to entertain ideas or conspiracy theories without first being provided with proof. Sometimes, there&#39;s barely even going to be satisfying evidence. </p>

<p>If that is a problem for you, save yourself some stress and stop reading up about this. Read more about cutting-edge science or geopolitical theory. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What else could figuring out how a theory works be, if not trying to figure out if it has evidence and its moving parts are real?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically the same answer as above. Does needing to believe a conspiracy is real before discussing it not seem to be a bit of a convoluted approach to you? </p>

<p>I could understand if we were publishing scientific papers, but we&#39;re not. My main point is that <em>your</em> need to believe something is &#39;real&#39; enough to be worth discussing is not a perspective other people need to follow. </p>

<p>Years ago this sub had tons of interesting conversations on topics both new to me and topics I <em>thought</em> I knew. Many of them involved accepting massive gaps in evidence and a total lack of proof. </p>

<p>Now, discussions of the substance are drowned out by ubiquitous demands for proof or hard evidence. What&#39;s the point of that?</p>

<p>Each individual submission is not expected to fully solve whatever political/metaphysical/existential/historical issue it&#39;s discussing. We can&#39;t even do that for non-conspiracy things. </p>

<p>Before substance on this sub was overwhelmed by rigid demands of proof, you could read interesting morsels of information that would lead you to another. And then another. All of a sudden a few months later you realize that while all of the original claims may not have panned out, they led you to information you&#39;d never have come across (or understood in context) without that path. </p>

<p>I understand your general desire to know if a topic is real enough based on existing (and more importantly, publicly accessible) evidence before discussing it further. But it&#39;s just not feasible for most <em>conspiracy theories.</em></p>

<p>So there&#39;s a big difference between asking for tangible evidence and asking why someone believes or is interested in a theory. </p>

<p>I love theories about the origins of humanity. Not only is there a lack of satisfying tangible evidence, but I also don&#39;t trust the honesty of many of the expert bodies that provide the evidence. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just the nature of the conspiracy game. Being a critical thinker doesn&#39;t just mean believing scientifically approved ideas, it means making your own determinations about topics.</p>

<p>For conspiracy theories, you&#39;ll always have to be willing to entertain ideas that have an unsatisfying amount of evidence or proof. That doesn&#39;t mean <em>believe</em> them, it means use your critical thinking skills to look for agendas, manipulation, omission, etc. Over time, we hone those skills. </p>

<p>But we&#39;ll never hone these critical thinking skills if we only entertain or discuss topics based on a level of evidence that satisfies our need to know it&#39;s real enough. </p>

<p>Especially when the institutions and people who control and determine what counts as real evidence are often implicated in the conspiracies themselves. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not &#39;trust, but verify&#39; it&#39;s more like &#39;listen, verify where you can, seek out more, repeat.&#39;</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t feel to me that you&#39;re interested in any sort of sincere discussion, but I&#39;m trying to have one in case I&#39;m wrong about that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now see that&#39;s a straw man. I said you want to stifle conversation, not that it affects me at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh my bad. I didn&#39;t realize it was just you knowing what I want. I&#39;ll let people read our comments and make their own decisions about who wants to stifle conversation about conspiracy theories. </p>

I will admit I often am more willing to be an opposing voice when the OP starts spreading conjecture as fact. I’m not saying there’s not people that are too demanding of proof and that can stifle discussion, but I also think if the OP states something is a fact (Podesta IS a pedophile being an example I often see, versus Podesta is a suspected pedophile) then we do need to start talking about proof and hard evidence. </p>

<p>This is a subreddit for skeptics.

<p>In other words, you&#39;re saying that anti-Trump posts don&#39;t get much traction. That&#39;s false. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xqt3e/dont_let_them_divide_us_brothers_sisters_of/dmizqfg/">Here are a bunch of examples</a>. Also, [the current top post on this sub is <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/72k3fe/a_handful_of_ultrarich_dynastic_families_are/">anti-Trump</a>. I&#39;ve seen this talking point pushed around on this sub way too many times and it&#39;s usually not called out. </p>

<p>This sub is full of many different groups. Some people here don&#39;t believe any conspiracy theories. Some people here support Hillary Clinton. Some believe Trump is just crazy enough to make waves. Some hate trump. Some believe the earth is flat. The list goes on. </p>

<p>If you check political posts, it&#39;s usually the anti-Trump comments that are at the top of the thread, upvoted into the hundreds, occasionally gilded, and sometimes those top comments claim they will be downvoted for being anti-Trump, yet nobody figures it out. </p>

<p>Some notable examples:</p>

<p>You have probably noticed that there are more Trump supporting posts than there are anti-Trump posts. That&#39;s obvious because conspiracy theorists tend to support politicians who market themselves as anti-establishment, such as Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Trey Gowdy, Bernie Sanders, etc. However, the actual number of anti Trump people in here is probably 50 percent at least because you have to account for anti-Trump comments hitting the top of those pro-Trump threads again and again. What we need to do is stop complaining about a non-issue. Anti-Trumpism usually dominates the comments in this sub. </p>

<p>What actually doesn&#39;t make sense is the huge amount of people in this sub who apparently don&#39;t believe any conspiracy theories. Skepticism is fine and healthy, but what we have are borderline trolls who parrot the official story on numerous topics. If I wanted the official story to be parroted to me, I&#39;d turn on Fox News or CNN. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>no constructive thought and a lot of skepticism towards actual conspiracy related content. Skepticism is good, I admit, but the downright dismissiveness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are lots of problems with the &quot;discussions&quot; that happen in here.  I personally am extremely skeptical of any conspiracy presented and typically ask for evidence or at least a location where I can learn more.  Unless I know the reddit user, I see no reason to trust them.  They could be anyone, and in order to verify for myself that the conspiracy isn&#39;t someone&#39;s agenda item, I need to know where it comes from.</p>

<p>To be honest, I have received quite a bit more condescending, dismissive rhetoric in response to reasonable requests for more information than I have ever dealt out.  People respond to requests for evidence or information with all sorts of accusations (like calling me various modfications of &#39;shill&#39;), or with insults, or even more frequently with deflection.</p>

<p>I think alot of skeptical people like me are also very frustrated when people post things in this forum that are demonstrably false.  Making claims about people and things that don&#39;t exist, or deliberately taking quotes or information out of context in order to paint those things as much more sinister than they actually are, that&#39;s the most frustrating thing, to a skeptic, and there&#39;s quite a bit of that going on in here as well. </p>

The upvotes/downvotes on comments are weird, but the good content is there if you uncollapse comments and ignore people trying to stir up emotional responses. 9/11 articles, historical articles, power structure, wealth inequality, propaganda articles have been at the top.

    <div class="md"><p>My first hypothesis is that this is partially the natural result of having fewer active moderators after removing Flytape, Drone_Puppet, and Sarah_Connor.  I didn&#39;t check the moderator log frequently, but Flytape in particular seemed really active.</p>

<p>Another thought is that the minority who made the discussions here so interesting decided to migrate to other communities, as many thought the admins getting involved to oust Flytape was a clear indication this community was now compromised.</p>

<p>The new queue has a bunch more spam that doesn&#39;t belong in this sub than it seemed to, but that could just be that the same amount is sticking around longer.  Also bizarre, were during the few weeks after the mod shakeup, quite a few submissions were really exaggerated in which the OPs would, as a rule, respond hostilely to everyone.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the emphasis on TMoR seems new to me.  Either they&#39;ve stepped up their activity towards this sub, or some group is utilizing them as a foil for this sub, attempting to waste our energy squabbling with them to no end.</p>

<p>In other words, you&#39;re saying that anti-Trump posts don&#39;t get much traction. That&#39;s false. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xqt3e/dont_let_them_divide_us_brothers_sisters_of/dmizqfg/">Here are a bunch of examples</a>. Also, [the current top post on this sub is <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/72k3fe/a_handful_of_ultrarich_dynastic_families_are/">anti-Trump</a>. I&#39;ve seen this talking point pushed around on this sub way too many times and it&#39;s usually not called out. </p>

<p>This sub is full of many different groups. Some people here don&#39;t believe any conspiracy theories. Some people here support Hillary Clinton. Some believe Trump is just crazy enough to make waves. Some hate trump. Some believe the earth is flat. The list goes on. </p>

<p>If you check political posts, it&#39;s usually the anti-Trump comments that are at the top of the thread, upvoted into the hundreds, occasionally gilded, and sometimes those top comments claim they will be downvoted for being anti-Trump, yet nobody figures it out. </p>

<p>Some notable examples:</p>

<p>You have probably noticed that there are more Trump supporting posts than there are anti-Trump posts. That&#39;s obvious because conspiracy theorists tend to support politicians who market themselves as anti-establishment, such as Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Trey Gowdy, Bernie Sanders, etc. However, the actual number of anti Trump people in here is probably 50 percent at least because you have to account for anti-Trump comments hitting the top of those pro-Trump threads again and again. What we need to do is stop complaining about a non-issue. Anti-Trumpism usually dominates the comments in this sub. </p>

<p>What actually doesn&#39;t make sense is the huge amount of people in this sub who apparently don&#39;t believe any conspiracy theories. Skepticism is fine and healthy, but what we have are borderline trolls who parrot the official story on numerous topics. If I wanted the official story to be parroted to me, I&#39;d turn on Fox News or CNN. </p>

<p><strong>Look at the bright side, bro!</strong> </p>

<p>The world is full of people like your &quot;Bob&quot; - some of which are just assholes that are proud of their arrogant ignorance, and <strong><em>others</em></strong> who are on a MISSION - especially when it comes to certain topics that are of &quot;INTEREST&quot; to them. The latter will not only flatly deny and insult you, they will send you off on seeming &quot;wild-goose chases&quot;, they will also LIE THEIR ASSES OFF - repeatedly regurgitating the same shit, even when they&#39;ve had their faces rubbed in it multiple times. </p>

<p>These are the hard-core ideologues - they don&#39;t give a SHIT about what is true or false or &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;,  - they tell lies as naturally as they breathe. All they care about is WINNING, and for them that means that THEIR perceived interests prevail over &quot;the opposition&quot;, and there is ZERO moral compunction against &quot;dirty pool&quot; in their mindset.</p>

<p>THE GOOD NEWS is that when these fuckers deny and lie and ask for &quot;PROOF!!!&quot;, you start to <strong><em>research</em></strong>, and pretty soon you start to learn where to look (and where NOT to look), and you begin uncovering amazing facts about history and politics and <em>whatever</em> that you likely would have NEVER FOUND had it not been for these LYING ASSHOLES dismissing and challenging you at every point.</p>

<p>So after a while, you begin to compile a stock of irrefutable information from impeccable sources, then the pieces start falling together... Amazing.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s the trick: DO NOT expect the assholes you have been debating to back down or to <em>accept</em> any information you&#39;ve uncovered - that is NOT going to happen, because they aren&#39;t interested in facts or truth - <em>they never have been</em>. Their goal is to pimp <em>their</em> agenda to serve <em>their</em> interests, so in most cases, they will respond by simply dismissing or belittling your sources, no matter how original or authoritative, OR they will double-down by impugning your &quot;motives&quot; for researching such matters - launching ad hominem attacks, etc.</p>

<p>THAT, friend, is when you know you are moving in the right direction. Their level of anger and HATRED directed toward you is the best measure that you are moving in the right direction.</p>

<p>When you write, answering these ideologically-driven ignoramuses, remember that you are NOT addressing THEM, but OTHERS who might be following the conversational debate. </p>

<p>So your goal should NEVER be to convince the &quot;Bobs&quot; of the world, that isn&#39;t going to happen. Your goal should be to use the denial and the lies that the &quot;Bobs&quot; throw at you as springboards for further research, the fruits of which will not only enrich your own understanding, but educate, enlighten and edify the &quot;silent readers&quot; who lurk in the background.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Don&#39;t take things personally, or let the ASSHOLES get under your skin. If you play it right, these caustic bastards can &quot;help&quot; you to get an education that NO amount of money could buy.</p>
