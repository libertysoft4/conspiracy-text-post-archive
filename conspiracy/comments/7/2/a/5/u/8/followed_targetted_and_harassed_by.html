        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Apparently, I got on their radar with this post: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/70fndy/which_reddit_matrix_level_are_you_in_if_you_are/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/70fndy/which_reddit_matrix_level_are_you_in_if_you_are/</a> which they linked and upvoted to their front page.</p>

<p>Today, I posted in a very small sub <a href="/r/punchableface">/r/punchableface</a> ( a smaller version of the similar sub with the plural name, it has less than 7,000 users and usually shows around 10 people online there ) and well, some characters showed up to attack me personally in that thread, then it was linked to topminds:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/72a1ja/rconspiracy_stalwart_and_top_mind_ventures_into/">https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/72a1ja/rconspiracy_stalwart_and_top_mind_ventures_into/</a></p>

<p>What I suspect in how this was possible, is there are keyword searches, for example &quot;Racist&quot; which was in the post title - and then it goes to the Reddit Community Team, who is in league with TopMindsofReddit.  Either that, or they have somehow followed my account to monitor anything I post so that they can give me that artificial miserable reddit experience of angry people and downvotes, a form of gangstalking and gaslighting.</p>

<p>How did ElCaminoSS396 find that post, and why would he put it on TopMinds?  I suspect that perhaps he himself was one of those alts who showed up to try to bait me etc - to provide more of theatre that he could then post on his sub.  Who told him I posted that?  How did he know?  Something is wrong here.  Even the only comment so far on the TopMind post is just basically saying they don&#39;t see the problem.  What is going on? </p>

<p>There has to be some recourse here, this stalking is abusive.  </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just happening to me.</p>

<p>Imo this is probably the case, but why? I&#39;m pretty certain I dislike Flat Earthers as much as they dislike the Conspiracy community and I know there&#39;s a lot of people here that are the same way, but I don&#39;t follow them around on reddit criticizing them for it, nor is there some kind of database on them as far as I know. It just doesn&#39;t seem like something that would happen organically to me. It&#39;s so much effort for no payoff at all</p>

But back before the site was a behemoth—when the most rudimentary version of Reddit launched, Ohanian and Huffman set up several fake accounts to submit content, just to make the site appear more active. &quot;How do you get people to look at your user-driven website when you don&#39;t have any users? You fake them, naturally,&quot; Ohanian writes.</a></p>

<p>There is, but it&#39;s against reddit rules, and indeed the law. Reddit admins are akin to the State; when the government is in bed with the very people they&#39;re supposed to protect their citizens against, the citizens have no other recourse than to enforce natural law (and seek justice) by their own unilateral means.</p>

<p>Frankly I hope this drama between r/conspiracy and the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/71qi7q/what_i_learned_from_trolling_rtopmindsofreddit/dndc84b/">frustrated</a> teenagers over at TMoR doesn&#39;t break into all-out war. Indeed that would entail great violence, and useless suffering on their side.</p>

<p>I know for a fact lots of good hackers hang on r/conspiracy. They are free thinkers by definition, and are thus attracted to this place. These people know what remote code execution vulnerabilities are, and have client-side exploit kits ready-to-use. Submitting links to unfamiliar people is similarly trivial.</p>

<p>Personally I chose to empathize; I realize how insecure and sad one must be to engage in such sterile activities. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/71tpkj/never_forget_rip_reddit_rpolitics/dnedvm9/">This is the kind</a> of reply I tend to prefer when one of those guys addresses me. </p>
