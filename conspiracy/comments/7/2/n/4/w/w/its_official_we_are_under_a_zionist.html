    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really not very accurate. The Globalists basically are the Zionists. Much more accurate to say Globalists vs. Nationalists, and this is a battle that has been going on since the founding of America, and long before that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought so too but the post was pretty good it stating what I wrote above.  Trump is a good example as a Zionist &amp; Nationalist.  Obama supported Iran and was a globalist.  Globalist vs. Nationalist is very easy to see, then just research were they stand on the Iran nuke deal to get your answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><sup><sup>^</sup></sup> this.  Theory is fundamentally incorrect, Zionists and globalists are part of the same exact group.  Trump is trying to appease both the military / nationalist factions (his base) and the Zionists / globalists to keep his head on his shoulders, protect his family and keep his job intact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s been reports that Trump may have blackmail through the Mossad or the CIA of sex / snuff tapes with an underage girl, but there isn&#39;t any real evidence to support it.  He&#39;s definitely doing some things that are questionable, but I think generally speaking he&#39;s working towards positive goals for the country.  The tax reform and how he handles the inevitable bankruptcy of the dollar is really going to define him, I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know they&#39;ve already tried to get him with the pissgate incident. Comey admitted to all of the facts consistent with it being used at blackmail: discussed it with president, said that the memo would be leaked. </p>

<p>Only thing he didn&#39;t say was whether he also told the president that the leak would be dependent on the president doing something, but it&#39;s not hard to connect the dots.</p>

<p>Then look at the fact that Priebus was telling him to basically shut down the campaign after the pussygrabber comment got out. It looks like that was some of the worst material they had. </p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m pretty confident the worst things about Trump are what&#39;s in the public domain: associated with Roy Cohn, womanizer, associated with Epstein and Clintons, and worked in New York real estate (implies bribes) and casinos (implies assistance to CIA drug money laundering). Attacking him with any of these is extremely problematic for a lot of powerful people.</p>
