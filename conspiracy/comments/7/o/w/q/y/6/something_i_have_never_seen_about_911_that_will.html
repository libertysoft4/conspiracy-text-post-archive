        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have never listened to Dr. Judy Wood because I assumed the building was rigged with demolition charges &amp; google her &amp; there is a ton of negative propaganda surrounding her &amp; the idea of directed energy weapons.</p>

<p>I like Jesse Ventura &amp; he interviewed her &amp; I finally got around to listening to it.
To my surprise, she seems intelligent &amp; perfectly lucid so I explored farther &amp; watched one of her lectures.</p>

<p>There was a section in that lecture where she shows two (2) photographs (before &amp; after) of a parking lot next to WTC Building 7 before it fell.</p>

<p>Here is the photograph of the lot before the cars are burned to a crisp:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/7ARDqoi.png">https://i.imgur.com/7ARDqoi.png</a></p>

<p>Here is a photograph BEFORE Building 7 fell &amp; THERE IS NO DEBRIS ON THE CARS that could have burned them AND THEY ARE burned so badly that there is no paint remaining on the cars. But trees/shrubs nearby are perfectly green &amp; unburnt:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/uL08cjY.png">https://i.imgur.com/uL08cjY.png</a></p>

<p>Plus notice that the burning virtually ceases at a very clear point.</p>

<p>Edit: So to clarify what I am saying is that hotel is near where Building 7 was &amp; it still HAD NOT FALLEN YET IN EITHER PHOTOGRAPH.</p>

<p>I AM NOT SAYING that the parking lot is right adjacent to Building 7.</p>

<p>What I am saying is that Building Seven is the closest building that could have dropped anything
on this parking lot. Sorry if I was imprecise with my wording.</p>

<p>2nd Edit for more clarity regarding timing:</p>

<p>I just want to point out that the before photo was taken well <strong>AFTER WTC 1 had come down already</strong>, so any damage to the cars would have already happened.</p>

<p>That means Building 7 would be the only building left to still fall &amp; do any additional possible damage which it did not do by proximity.</p>

<p><em>So what caused it?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to be extremely open minded &amp; even I have to admit that I closed my curiosity off to Judy Wood because there is so much negative information when you google her.</p>

<p>Somehow I thought google was giving a well rounded picture of her points. It wasn&#39;t until I heard her interviewed that I saw that she is
intelligent &amp; thoughtful.</p>

<p>I appreciated the fact that she was trying to look at what happened &amp; not try to shove a conclusion down my throat.</p>

<p>I feel Richard Gage is okay as well but we all bring our life experience to the table when trying to understand what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate how open minded you are! most people are not when it comes to what happened that day, its either thermite or nothing else for many people, </p>

<p>when I first found out about 9/11(this year) I looked a the different theory&#39;s that had been brought to the table, at first I thought of energy weapons being used was a crazy idea but then started to research it and realised how strong the evidence is</p>

<p>The book tells us alot of information that you would not be getting from other truthers.</p>

<p>Hurricane erin, the magnetometer readings, minimal seismic impact, Debris pile was laughable, 1,000+ toasted cars(cars that were also rusted within minutes), spire turning to dust, two other main bits of footage which show steel turning to dust with obvious dust trails in symmetry with the object, bizzare looking holes in the buildings after they &#39;came down&#39;, reports of people being levitated, reports of cars levitating and flipped over(there are also pictures that show cars on top of each other and bus&#39;s with cars on top of them), warped steel, just some of the bits of evidence I can think off the top my head the books has a hell of alot more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure! This is an excerpt from her book that I typed</p>

<p>Thermite is a substance made of aluminium powder and iron oxide(rust) the twin towers were steel structures with aluminium cladding,
steel is a term used for iron to which between 0.2 to 1.7% carbon has been added typical low-carbon steel (eg astm a36) contains 99% iron, </p>

<p>We know that a large portion of the towers was turned to dust , and iron dust in atmospheric conditions will immediately rust, so it is natural  and to be expected that materials that the buildings were made of would be found in the nano-dust of there remains, </p>

<p>the surprising thing would be if this nano-dust from the buildings did not contain &#39;thermatic material&#39;﻿</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t get why it has to be &quot;Just thermite!!!&quot; why not both?</p>

<p>Just because the govt doesn&#39;t keep the public abreast of all tech does that mean we should discount the burned vehicles where only certain materials seem to be affected in multiple disparate locations?</p>

<p>I mean there are some pretty strange &quot;straight line&quot; wildfire burn patterns going on in California lately we should at least consider it instead of sticking our heads in the sand.</p>

<p>Plus Judy Wood seems to have another reason for thermite being on the scene AND she admits that it is NOT THE ONLY reason it could be on the scene.</p>

<p>There isnt anything to test or measure so no matter how convinced you are, you cant prove it and thus cant have any demonstrable reason for a new investigation.</p>

<p>Try convincing a scientist in person or a lawyer based on your space weapon were involved in 9/11 arguments and want a new investigation.

Even Magnesium and Aluminum powder just left alone in atmosphere can spontaneously combust. This is an issue in many machine shops that machine these materials.

<p>Bullshit. &#39;Exotic accelerants&#39; didn&#39;t strip all the paint from a select group of cars. One of the cars was painted black &amp; it was stripped to where it looked totally white. &#39;Exotic accelerants&#39; didn&#39;t remove the glass from all those cars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps Gage has some information regarding Judy Woods that you do not retain?</p>

<p>Interesting story.</p>

<p>When r/rconspiracy had the fake Richard Gage AMA where an infiltrator made it passed mod vetting the fake Richard Gage was telling people that he thought Wood&#39;s evidence was of interest and worth looking into.</p>

<p>I always think of that when I see Wood&#39;s theories being pushed as fact. I am not new to this, I have seen the truth movement greats like Griffin and Chandler relentlessly attacked by the same people who hail Woods as the the answer to nothing. Which is what her talks and books ultimately lead to. Nothing.  You are more than welcome to cling to fringe that is your prerogative but you shouldn&#39;t act surprised when your voice is ignored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guarantee that the black car had white primer. So stomething stripped the the clear coat and the paint off it. If bare ferrite metal is exposed to low ph it will oxidize very quickly, like minutes or hours quickly. You can see this by wiping acidic flux on anything that sticks to a magnet except maybe nickel.</p>

<p>Like I said before I don&#39;t have issue with Dr Woods but there is not enough information.
Take the pillar that &quot;turns to dust&quot; I have seen highdef images of that thing that clearly shows it falling. So either the images of it falling were doctored after the fact or she was fooled into thinking she saw it turn to dust. I thinks she believes what she says I just think that extremely hot flows of gas and low ph could also explain the cars. Tempered glass will shatter with sudden temp changes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hoverbrothers.com/about/">http://www.hoverbrothers.com/about/</a></p>

<p>The evidence from 9/11 shows that Jeremy Rys is 20 years behind what already exists. Trashing Dr. Wood’s work then later presenting it as his own is bad form, at a minimum. </p>

<p>I wonder why Mr. Rys promotes Mr. Gage&#39;s disinformation? But then, the uninformed opinion of a two time felon is meaningless and irrelevant.</p>

<p>At 10:23 p.m., Jeremy Rys (Alienscientist), 1 Cherry St., was put in custody on an arrest warrant. Police went to his home at 9:15 p.m., and his family said he was not home. Police received a call from Rys who said he forgot his phone charger when he went to work, and will call his probation officer in the morning. Dispatch called probation who asked for Rys to be picked up by police.</p>

<p>It&#39;s what happens when cars start on fire. Also: fire kind of fucks with glass. <a href="http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/04/15/cars-go-up-in-flames-at-fremont-used-car-lot/">http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/04/15/cars-go-up-in-flames-at-fremont-used-car-lot/</a></p>

<p>Rusted cars = ones that started on fire. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/uk5SYdp.png">Either some crazy force is at play that caused this line to start on fire, or the fires spread.</a>. </p>

<p><strong>WOW WHAT?</strong> I might have actually just found something really fucking interesting.  </p>

<p>Also looking at the images, I just noticed what&#39;s <a href="https://i.imgur.com/lZo5dyK.png">probably the source of the fire!</a>. </p>

<p><strong>But wait, what the hell? I think I just found something REALLY interesting</strong></p>

<p>I tried to figure out what that giant black area was. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/sOAC3i5.png">It appears to be some kind of utility shed/building???</a>. In the before and after it&#39;s no longer there. Also it appears to be at the &quot;center&quot; of where the chain of cars started on fire. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/RQDv70F.jpg">Here&#39;s a ground view of it.</a>. </p>

<p>Building actually seems like it exploded. Wonder what the fuck was in it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you talking about the one that connects to that building with the glass dome thing? AKA the American Express Building - the two make up the World Financial Center. Otherwise I have no clue what building you&#39;re talking about then. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find a good picture prior to the cleanup of anything else in the vicinity really. I wish I got the building that&#39;s right of the glass dome, because that&#39;s closer to the parking lot in question - but it&#39;s the best I could do. </p>

<p>The point I was trying to make is that in most of the pictures, the cleanup has already begun. Debris did indeed stretch pretty damn far our. </p>

<p>That link is just a video of some cars on fire. They have shattered windows. The glass on these cars is eliminated NOT shattered. </p>

<p>How the heck can you even tell unless you&#39;re just making an assumption because &quot;you know&quot; based on what you saw on some website? The cars look damn near exactly the same, except the WTC cars had 2 of the largest buildings in the world also fall on them. The paint is stripped from those cars as well. </p>

<p>Yup, I don&#39;t believe anything was suspicious about WTC7, the twin towers, or the pentagon. I believe a plane was shot down over a field in Pennsylvania, I believe some very power Saudis funded 9/11, I believe Bin Laden was blamed for it, and I believe we used it to justify two unnecessary occupations. So yeah, I believe the official story ;) </p>

<p>The parking lot was on Vesey Street the point was that Building 7 was the nearest building that came down that could have dropped anything to burn those cars. </p>

<p>The question was what happened to those cars when the closest building hadn&#39;t even come down yet?</p>

<p>From her lecture she indicates that the Kingdome implosion showed a magnitude of 2.3 when it came down &amp; WTC1&amp; WTC2 showed virtually nothing when they came down meaning they were reduced basically to dust with very little intact pieces hitting the ground.</p>

<p>wow dude!  listen to yourself! &quot;she <em>obviously knows better</em></p>

<p>Yeah .. than you do and by a HUGE amount ... you&#39;re just parroting the thermite narrative becoz that&#39;s all you know about</p>

<p>where&#39;s the thermite <em>burning concrete</em> videos that must be there becoz You say it can? </p>

<p>link ONE!  And how MUCH of the stuff would it take to disintergrate 300,000 tons of steel?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t even destroy it&#39;s <em>own weight</em> when burning metal.</p>

<p>One of it&#39;s uses is to fuse train tracks together -- it&#39;s often put in a flowerpot as the clay wont burn but the thermite can melt the metal via the small hole in the base of the pot! </p>

<p>What&#39;s the &quot;melting point&quot; of concrete anyway? Does it even have one?</p>

<p>AND WILL NOT BURN CONCRETE! Not that there was much concrete in the WTC&#39;s, just 300k tons of steel in <em>each</em> tower ... and where the fuck did that go? Teleported to Mars with your reasoning?</p>

<p>How does it pulverize it?</p>

<p>The same way dynamite does. By being explosive. </p>

<p>Because it was engineered on the nanolevel.
When the surface area increases so does the rate of reaction, and you cant get any better than the nanoscale. </p>

<p>How is it made on the nanoscale?</p>

<p>By using very specialized equipment that can use many different methods to achieve it, precipitation or pyrolisis, etc. </p>

<p>thermite is NOT an explosive, it <em>burns</em></p>

<p>explosives go &quot;bang&quot; <em>becoz</em> they <em>burn so fast</em> they explode</p>

<p>thermite does not burn fast enough to explode</p>

<p>And IF it had, we ALL would&#39;ve heard it ... explain that?</p>

<p>I think thermite was used to &#39;cut&#39; the main steel columns as can be seen in the wreckage with those diagonal &quot;cuts&quot; through 18&quot; steel beams BUT that&#39;s NOT what caused the building to turn into dust</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used thermite several times and I can assure you IF it &quot;exploded&quot; there&#39;s NO way it would be used in those processes</p>

<p>You&#39;re stuck in your simplified beliefs.  And the best you can do is parrot other&#39;s opinions as if they are yours. And you&#39;re all wrong</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, where to start? </p>

<p>Firstly, fires jumping out spontaneously is a perfect example of thermite explosives going off that didn’t fire during the top-down style demolition of the two towers when they were likely suppose to. In fact, there is video evidence of small explosions going off in the wreckage/rubble after the towers collapsed. No need for space beams, just plain old thermite not going off when intended in a pile of rubble. That would lead to random fires occurring out of nowhere.</p>

<p>Secondly, we are talking about hundreds of tons of thermite and thermate (thermite plus sulfur catalyst) engineered on the nano-level. These highly refined particles of Iron Oxide and Aluminum are on average 100-1000 smaller than a human blood cell. That is already 1000 smaller than a human hair. When a exothermic reaction (releases heat) has an increase in surface area for reaction it quickens the rate exponentially. A normal thermite reaction can be tailored specifically to be explosive or slow burning. We are talking about the explosive kind engineered beyond anything anyone could make without highly specific equipment. In order to get that much thermitic material in place would have to have had insider help. The elevator shafts which are also key structural columns were modernized during the 9 months leading up to 9/11. Larry Silverstein, the owner of the WTC, has made over 5 Billion dollars off of his insurance on the towers specifically citing plane crashes. He owned the buildings for less than a year I think. </p>

<p>All of this and more can be learned in the link below. </p>

<p>anyway, who&#39;d use thermite on concrete, the shit <em>doesn&#39;t burn!</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is stating that concrete burns, we said pulverized, because the thermite was engineered on the nanoscale to be  explosive. </p>

<p>When you increase surface area, the rate of a chemical reaction increases as well. </p>

<p>Thermite engineered on the nanolevel is highly explosive and pulverized the concrete the same way used in controlled demolitions.</p>

<p>Intense heat focused on a small spot can be used to cut through metal or weld metal components together both by melting metal from the components, and by injecting molten metal from the thermite reaction itself.</p>

<p>The same way dynamite does. By being explosive. </p>

<p>Because it was engineered on the nano-level.</p>

<p>er, NO, that&#39;s NOT how it works. You never studied chemistry that&#39;s for sure</p>

<p>And yet here you talk about &quot;increased surface area&quot; which has SFA to DO with how thermite BURNS, and it does not &#39;explode&#39;</p>

<p>Show me a video of thermite making <em>anything</em> (except ice or a gas bottle) &quot;explode&quot; when exposed to thermite ... You CANNOT as it does not &#39;explode&#39;</p>

<p>The metal fence radiation barrier</p>

<p>Just like the metal grid at a microwave oven window, the metal fence made of wire mesh acts as reflecting radiation barrier:</p>

<p>due to reflection, even those cars that were located far away from the wire mesh got such a high radiation dose that they took fire</p>

<p>Cars behind the wire mesh fence are undamaged</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I have no answers, just here to give context as to &quot;what we&#39;re looking at&quot;. My argument is that the WTC1&amp;2 debris definitely reached that parking lot. </p>

<p>Also I think you are improperly sourcing the time when the 2nd picture was taken (before WTC7 fell - I&#39;m pretty sure that was DAYS later - which I&#39;ll get to). </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kiAcTj1.png">OK so, an easy to spot landmark is the squiggly line brick path, as seen here</a>. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3WiwoSZ.jpg">this image, the circled parking lot is that parking lot</a>. </p>

<p>To tie the two together and &quot;prove&quot; it&#39;s that parking lot, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LlgzJ2W.png">here we go</a>. The red brick where the arrow is = the squiggles marked. </p>

<p>Now notice I circled &quot;cleaned road.&quot; A lot of aerial 9/11 images were taken 10 days after 9/11. Why is this relevant? Because it looks like that parking lot is magically isolated from the debris pool. I couldn&#39;t find any images directly showing the intersection near the parking lot, but I did find this one of the pre-cleanup of the American Express building (AMEX). Thus take note of &quot;AMEX&quot; and &quot;Cleaned road&quot;. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/dpKzuGD.jpg">road look like near AMEX before the cleanup in the aerial photo.</a></p>

<p>Next we have proof WTC1&amp;WTC2 reached the parking lot and thus &quot;WTC 7 is far to the left&quot; probably doesn&#39;t matter, because that collapse HAPPENED and could explain the car fires. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a photo of (I believe, but I cannot say for certain) <a href="https://i.imgur.com/I6M8yCg.jpg">the second WTC to collapse collapsing.</a>. It appears the parking lot already has a dusting of white soot from the first collapse (hence I assume it&#39;s the 2nd). </p>

<p>Now your second picture says it&#39;s &quot;BEFORE WTC7 FELL&quot;, but that appears to be inaccurate according to the above site&#39;s images. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/hENBMcC.jpg">Here&#39;s what it looked like on 9/11 after both towers fell</a>. Here is the same image with squiggles as a landmark. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/SNd7Rzu.png">https://i.imgur.com/SNd7Rzu.png</a></p>

<p>Again, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mSz14oz.png">this is what your image claims is &quot;before building 7 fell&quot;</a> looks like. Notice the differences? That image is half covered in soot, half clean as fuck. The shrubbery/trees are somewhat cleared of debris. The road is clean. Cars are in different places. Cars are rusty. If you want the where&#39;s waldo edition, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/BzCzvOh.png">here&#39;s a few of the observations.</a> </p>

<p>Meaning, the second image was taken DAYS after 9/11. </p>

<p>How did the cars start on fire? I don&#39;t know, but [this firetruck] appears to be in the area, possibly to respond to the fire, before the second tower collapsed. I&#39;d guess that something that was on fire from the building (let&#39;s say a binder of papers from the top floors) landed in/on one of the cars (windows open on a sunny day?) and started a fire. When one car started on fire it wasn&#39;t responded to (cause like 5 other burning buildings) and it spread to other cars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just want to point out that the before photo was taken well AFTER WTC 1 had come down already, so any damage to the cars would have already happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think I have sufficiently debunked that with evidence of rust, pictures of the site after both WTC fell, etc., </p>

<p>Wait so the alternative is some magical top-secret energy weapon was used for the first time by the US government in their largest city to &quot;roast cars&quot; because collapsing two of the largest buildings wouldn&#39;t have been &quot;theatrical&quot; enough? </p>

<p>I&#39;d much rather my fairytale narrative about <a href="https://i.imgur.com/sOAC3i5.png">this shed</a>. This shed that had flames coming out of it that were larger flames than any car on fire <a href="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/ec/3ecc3d99-6f9f-57cf-a17b-9928fa67cd07/55b2e8415da93.image.jpg">and the char marks look oddly similar to a natural gas leak</a>. This shed that is at the hotel where a witness who never mentions the parking lot fire says he was shoed away from due to a natural gas leak. This shed that appears to have had its entire roof blown off of and its green, possibly <a href="https://i.imgur.com/RQDv70F.jpg">metal door missing</a>. This shed that looks oddly similar to a natural gas regulator station with an empty, closed off servicing road/gate leading directly to it. This shed that&#39;s damn near centered by all the cars that started on fire. </p>

<p>Accept anything? I don&#39;t know if anyone has ever even noticed that shed before. </p>

<p>You&#39;re the one who accepted OP&#39;s theory without doing ANY research whatsoever. To quote you again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The parking lot was on Vesey Street the point was that Building 7 was the nearest building that came down that could have dropped anything to burn those cars.</p>

<p>The question was what happened to those cars when the closest building hadn&#39;t even come down yet?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I provided clear evidence that the second picture was taken AFTER 9/11. It wasn&#39;t taken on 9/11. Or before building 7 fell down. It seems you&#39;re the one who is willing to accept any evidence that fits your own narrative. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/hENBMcC.jpg">THIS is what the parking lot looked like after both WTC fell.</a>. The trees are covered in gray dust. </p>

<p>This is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/BzCzvOh.png">the picture the OP linked</a>. </p>

<p>You keep posting the building (WFC 2)with damage closest to the WTC 1 when we are talking about the (WFC 3) next building up closer to the parking lot. That is cherry picking your evidence.</p>

<p>The next building up (WFC 3) only as very minimal damage to the side facing WTC 1 &amp; it is a tall building.</p>

<p>You instead show a WTC 2&#39;s collapse plume/dust &amp; assume a large amount of debris resulted in the parking lot.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t as evidenced by the different photographs in your other link references (Judy Wood&#39;s site?).</p>

<p>The WFC3 front side facing WTC 1 &amp; directly adjacent to the parking lot has dust on the front with very minor damage to it&#39;s WTC 1 side &amp; that&#39;s it. Which proves debris just didn&#39;t bunnyhop that last building &amp; arrive on those cars.</p>

<p>As far as whether or not that is a gasline in front of the entrance to Embassy Suites.....of course it&#39;s possible, but what ignited it? Probably the same thing that ignited those cars which OP points to.</p>

<p>I assume you&#39;re talking about <a href="https://i.imgur.com/dpKzuGD.jpg">this image</a> - which I linked <strong>once?</strong> If you can find a better pre-cleanup image that overlooks the parking lot I applaud you or the AMEX building I applaud you. I couldn&#39;t find anything. Thus I found the nearest pre-cleanup angle I could find.</p>

<p><strong>The reason I commented in the first place was to prove that OP&#39;s **&quot;Before WTC7 collapsed picture&quot; was taken days after 9/11, not before WTC7 collapsed</strong>. My original comment (before the edits) started with &quot;So I have no answers, just here to give context as to &quot;what we&#39;re looking at&quot;. When I dug for those images, I spotted the black spot near the parking lot <a href="https://i.imgur.com/sOAC3i5.png">here in the right image</a>. Then I noticed that black spot was both the area where the fire was burning AND was previously some type of shed of sorts. I did not know that going into this. I did not find anyone else on the internet EVER mention that building. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You instead show a WTC 2&#39;s collapse plume/dust &amp; assume a large amount of debris resulted in the parking lot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, that&#39;s evident from <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JMSOh2Q.jpg">this picture</a>. If you&#39;re asking me if I believe trusses and shit fell in the parking lot? It doesn&#39;t appear so. But did potentially burning paper that could have ignited a fire end up there? Possibly. Here&#39;s the best ground-level photo I could find of that area. <a href="http://wheredidthetowersgo.com/articles/DEW/dewpics/0076v.jpg">It&#39;s mostly dust and papers.</a></p>

<p>Like I said, I don&#39;t KNOW how that fire began. Again, the initial purpose of my post is to provide a timeline as to when the &quot;before WTC7 picture&quot; was actually taken. In trying to establish a timeline, I found the shed. And that shed seems to have had its roof burned or blown off with a fire that was pretty intense there. That shed is also almost perfectly in the middle of the line of burned cars. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as whether or not that is a gasline in front of the entrance to Embassy Suites.....of course it&#39;s possible, but what ignited it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who knows how it started. But there was a fire large enough to destroy the roof on that building. The aerial photos of those cars post-collapse seem to suggest that building was the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JMSOh2Q.jpg">most intense area of that fire.</a>. Regardless of how it started, something in that building was clearly very flammable. I think based on that image, we can both agree that there is something burning in there that resulted in fairly large flames. Maybe a valve failed when a natural gas line was damaged from the WTC1&amp;2 collapsed and that&#39;s where the pressure was released &quot;down the line.&quot; Maybe a there were electronics/a generator in that shed and outside air vented inside and the ventilation unit failed and they overheated. The book adds some merit to my argument as a witness claims authorities were shoeing people away from the Embassy due to a &quot;natural gas leak.&quot; That book seems to mention it in passing (vs detailing any explosion/parking lot fire) so IMO it adds a bit of validity to a potential gas leak. And I&#39;d say it&#39;s damn coincidental that the cars in the radius nearest to the shed started on fire. </p>

<p>You also have the chicken-egg dilemma. <strong>Did the cars cause the building to ignite or the building cause the cars to ignite?</strong> I cannot answer that question for you. And as far as I&#39;m concerned, it doesn&#39;t really matter in my mind. It&#39;s much more feasible that a second event happens with as much debris (NOT TRUSSES, but the dust/papers/other shit) as there was than there being some completely unheard of energy weapon. </p>

<p>Also if it was thermite falling that caused those fires (not saying you believe it, but because that&#39;s one theory I heard) you&#39;re assuming that falling debris DID start those fires. Why isn&#39;t it reasonable that another type of falling debris that&#39;s burning could also reach the same area and start it? </p>

<p>Either way, I think I added a neat little piece of evidence to the discussion. The shed leaves more questions as to what was inside it/why did it ignite. </p>

<p>Sorry that my information wasn&#39;t interesting enough for you to receive an immediate dopamine rush from reading some &#39;ground shattering&#39; revelation about how 9/11 was done by unknown energy weapons. Fact of the matter is, in an hour of research I provided a trail of images that conclusively debunk Dr Judy Wood&#39;s claim which states that image was taken &quot;before WTC7 collapsed&quot;. Considering that Dr Judy Wood is one of the more well-known conspiracy theorists, has a book published, and maintains one of the larger 9/11 conspiracy sites, I think I did a pretty good job.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a sad state of the world when a conspiracy theorist &quot;in search of the truth&quot; world chooses to believe the pet project of someone who peddles things that are blatantly misleading or a lie in search of book sales. If they&#39;re trying to mislead you on one fact, their other facts are probably trash, too. Solid/honest research is probably never going to give you some outlandish conclusion that&#39;s exciting. Most solid research is boring as fuck because it doesn&#39;t consider a narrative, it works in facts. I&#39;m not going to stop you from being misled by the most &quot;exciting&quot; answer. I can only place the breadcrumbs for you to follow. I can&#39;t debunk every single claim, because there is not enough time in a day and I am not writing a book. My answer might be boring, but I did everything I could to paint the full picture for you. It&#39;s on you to analyze that evidence and choose to believe it. It&#39;s my hopes that by seeing just one such example of Judy Wood misleading people, you may be able to critically analyze the pile of lies Judy Wood spreads.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another bread crumb for you. The police car stacked on the other car is from after the cleanup began. A reporter acknowledges the cleanup crew stacked that car on top of another car. Wood even cites that clip in her presentations, then later presents the car as &quot;being impossible to end up like that&quot;. </p>

<p><em>I came to discus one and only one matter.</em> <strong>Was the second picture in OP&#39;s post taken BEFORE or AFTER WTC7 fell.</strong> OP and Judy Wood claims it was taken BEFORE WTC7 fell.

Many were half burned, that is to say, from the back doors to the tag, burnt to a crisp, no paint, no seats, no glass but from the front doors to the hood ornament, clean and unaffected, not even from intense heat. That is a fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a completely bullshit thread.  I commented that this is not near Building 7 and it is in fact not even a picture of anywhere in NYC. My comment was down voted then deleted.   I have lived in NYC my whole life and was here for 9/11.  This picture of this parking lot is not, nor ever was in NYC.  There were no parking lots next to any of the buildings at the World Trade Center.  There was an under ground parking lot but that was it.  There is no area anywhere in Manhattan that has grass and bushes in parking lots.  This is a garbage thread and should be deleted.  </p>

<p>That link is just a video of some cars on fire. They have shattered windows. The glass on these cars is eliminated NOT shattered.</p>

<p>How the heck can you even tell unless you&#39;re just making an assumption because &quot;you know&quot; based on what you saw on some website? The cars look damn near exactly the same, except the WTC cars had 2 of the largest buildings in the world also fall on them. The paint is stripped from those cars as well. </p>

<p>So far you have just linked to a bunch of shit to tie your official story to. It&#39;s crap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, I don&#39;t believe anything was suspicious about WTC7, the twin towers, or the pentagon. I believe a plane was shot down over a field in Pennsylvania, I believe some very power Saudis funded 9/11, I believe Bin Laden was blamed for it, and I believe we used it to justify two unnecessary occupations. So yeah, I believe the official story ;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is NOT an explosive</p>

<ul>
<li>Thermite reactions have many uses. Thermite is not an explosive; instead it operates by exposing a very small area to extremely high temperatures.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Intense heat focused on a small spot can be used to cut through metal or weld metal components together both by melting metal from the components, and by injecting molten metal from the thermite reaction itself.</p>
