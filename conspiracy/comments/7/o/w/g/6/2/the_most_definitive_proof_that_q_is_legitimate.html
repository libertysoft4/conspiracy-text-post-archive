        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>By now, you may have heard that Trump tweeted some thing about a &quot;consensual presidency.&quot; Here is an article from NY Mag discussing it:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/T5PfJ">http://archive.is/T5PfJ</a></p>

<p>Later, Trump edited the Tweet: </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/950206338411499520">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/950206338411499520</a></p>

<p>Notice the new word? Not consensual, but CONSE<strong>Q</strong>UENTIAL.</p>

<p>With a <strong>Q</strong>. </p>

<p>All during this, Q began posting on the new 4+4chan site (I&#39;ll let you find it - we don&#39;t like to link directly to it but it&#39;s not hard to find from double chan). In helping us understand what have been at best cryptic messages from them, Q posted the following explanation of the Tweet:</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/YaIFp">https://imgur.com/a/YaIFp</a></p>

<p>Q also references the second half of Trump&#39;s tweet, stating that it was posted exactly 1 minute (7:24pm) after the first half (7:23pm). Note the times for yourself:</p>

<p>Tweet 1: <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/950206338411499520">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/950206338411499520</a></p>

<p>Tweet 2: <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/950206523690639360">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/950206523690639360</a></p>

<p>If you are new to this, Q has referred to the specific, to-the-minute time stamps between his posts on the chans and Trump&#39;s tweets. He says that the time stamp correlations will be the channel by which we, the anons, the PEOPLE, will authorize and confirm what Q is explaining when shit hits the fan and the Fake News Media won&#39;t be covering it, possibly due to a media black out:</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/5l5tM">https://imgur.com/a/5l5tM</a></p>

<p>Interesting timing, with the Fake News Awards being pushed back. </p>

<p>If you were still skeptical about Q, I&#39;d like to know what you think about all all this. If you believe Q:</p>

<p><strong>HOLY SHIT - SOMETHING MASSIVE AND UNPRECEDENTED IS TAKING PLACE.</strong></p>

<p><em>Added Bonus:</em> Q also alluded to the fact that when he posts &quot;[P-pers],&quot; he is referring to the President personally making a statement to the board.</p>

<p><em>Added Bonus 2:</em> Need I remind you that the official WikiLeaks Twitter account tweeted a post today soliciting a free copy of &quot;Fire and Fury&quot; in which they personally modified Chapters 6 and 10 to go from &quot;HOME&quot; to &quot;HQME&quot; and &quot;GOLDMAN&quot; to &quot;GQLDMAN&quot;? </p>

<p>Sorry, but thanks for putting this together. Regarding Q, I am a terrified optimist. Meaning, I love the idea of it all, but I rather think this whole thing is some mossad op and we are fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The chan boards are centered around anonymous posting - therefore, you don&#39;t need an account to post. You can post anything you want as &quot;Anonymous&quot; and it&#39;s (mostly) indistinguishable from any other Anonymous post on the site.</p>

<p>You can  also post with any name you want, but anybody else can too. So if I post with name &quot;OX&quot;, you can too and those would also be indistinguishable as being from separate posters.</p>

<p>Trip codes are for situations when someone wants to prove that they are the SAME poster across different posts without revealing an identity. On the chans, this is accomplished by giving a name for the post plus a password (of sorts). I might enter my name as &quot;OX##literallytherealone&quot;, and it would be shown as (essentially) &quot;OX#&quot; + 6 digit hash of my password.</p>

<p>Q was using trip codes on his posts on the different chans, but they change between sites (even between boards on a single site), making it impossible to verify that the 4ch &quot;Q&quot; posts were by the same person as the 8ch &quot;Q&quot;.</p>

<p>The idea of moving between sites is especially insidious, because a small/not well known site would be trivial to modify to mess with times and posts to fabricate evidence.</p>

<p>So, the fact that this &quot;shocking revelation&quot; is tied to a move to a completely obscure new site that just happens to finally have corroborating timestamps is, like I said, fishy at best.</p>
