        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Disclaimer: Since I will be accused of partisan hackery, I will state that I voted for Obama twice and supported Bernie Sanders in 2016.</p>

<p>For a sub about conspiracy, I&#39;m confused why the Steele dossier does not arouse more suspicion around here. I know there has been a migration of users from the politics sub that hate Trump and will defend anything anti-Trump, but this should not be a partisan issue.</p>

<p>What we know already is the Clinton campaign paid for the dossier and only admitted this after Congress had subpoenaed bank records and they knew it would come out. We know Steele met with reporters and briefed them on the information in the dossier, even though he had not corroborated everything inside. The reporters then published this unverified information.</p>

<p>While Congress has been investigating the dossier, we&#39;ve seen Fusion GPS obstruct at every turn. They tried to shield their bank records from Congress and the public, gave their testimony behind closed doors and plead the fifth numerous times. At the same time, the FBI has missed many deadlines to release their documents related to the dossier. Only under threat of contempt of Congress did they finally release the documents a couple days ago, at least six months after the initial request was made.</p>

<p>Which leads to the biggest question that isn&#39;t being asked here. Was the dossier used as intelligence in a FISA court to get a warrant to surveil the Trump transition team?</p>

<p>Maybe you dislike Trump and you don&#39;t care, but imagine it was happening to someone you support. If the dossier was used to get a FISA warrant, it&#39;s a very dangerous precedent to set. A politician can pay third parties (including foreign agents) to gather information on their opponent and then pass that information to the FBI to have their opponent spied on? This is not a partisan issue, this is about government corruption, the surveillance state and Republicans shouldn&#39;t be the only ones concerned.</p>

<p>During a night of heavy drinking at an upscale London bar in May 2016, George Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, made a startling revelation to Australia’s top diplomat in Britain: Russia had political dirt on Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>The hacking and the revelation that a member of the Trump campaign may have had inside information about it were driving factors that led the F.B.I. to open an investigation in July 2016 into Russia’s attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of President Trump’s associates conspired.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, because information received from someone who is drunk totally justify an investigation into a whole political team.   In case you missed it, this makes the intelligence community look worse not better, and all in a short sighted attempt to provide an alibi from messing up with the Steele dossier. </p>

<p>Concerning &#39;political dirt&#39; the Russians had.   Let us grant, for the sake of the argument, that this story is true.   What emails do you think are being referred to?  Do you think it was the DNC emails, which did the most harm, of which the last one is dated to MAY 25 2016?  You know, after this supposed conversation!  Do you think it might have been the 30,000 thousands emails that everyone was talking about during the investigation, no sorry, during that matter with Clinton? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>...Thus, the authors assure us, “We don’t believe the Steele dossier was the trigger for the F.B.I.’s investigation into Russian meddling.” Instead, the dossier that Simpson, Fritsch, and Steele were trumpeting as a smoking gun during the 2016 campaign is now portrayed as having merely “corroborated reports the bureau had received from other sources, including one inside the Trump camp.” That one source? Why, Papadopoulos, of course. (The op-ed here links to the Times’ blockbuster Papadopoulos report this past weekend.)  </p>

<p>Just one problem: What did the Justice Department and FBI do when the FBI received reports from these sources? They got a FISA warrant for Carter Page.  </p>

<p>If the FBI had such information about Page, it certainly did not get that information from Papadopoulos.  </p>

<p>As I explained in my aforementioned column, to get a FISA warrant to surveil an American citizen, the government has to show the FISA court probable cause that the citizen is engaged in clandestine activities on behalf of a foreign power (here, Russia), which activities may involve violations of federal criminal law. If the FBI had such information about Page, it certainly did not get that information from Papadopoulos — that’s clear from the Statement of the Offense filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller when Papadopoulos pled guilty a few weeks ago. To date, the only source we know of for such allegations against Page is the dossier. And at present, there is no basis to believe such allegations were ever verified by the FBI (wholly apart from the fact that they are highly unlikely on their face, and that Page has both vigorously denied them and filed a libel suit over them).  </p>

<p>In light of the significant questions that have been raised about the Obama Justice Department’s use of the dossier, it is understandable that the Fusion GPS founders who produced the dossier would want to downplay its significance in triggering the FBI’s Russia investigation. But that was not the tune they were playing at the time the FBI’s investigation was actually triggered. Back then, they couldn’t say enough about the Trump treachery Steele had purportedly uncovered, and with Election Day fast approaching, they wanted that story told far and wide.  </p>

<p>Now . . . not so much.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This.</p>

<p>The Washington Free Beacon paid for opposition research that eventually was directed towards Trump Org deals. Based on the discussions during the Republican debates, it is very likely that the Republican dossier dealt with Trump deals with the Italian mafia with a focus on his Atlantic City casinos. I don&#39;t remember any Republicans mentioning Felix Sater, Tevfik Arif, or Michael Cohen.</p>

<p>When the Republicans stopped the finance of the investigation, Fusion GPS was directed to take a better look into his business dealings. It could be possible that Fusion or the original investigators began investigating his business deals with the Russian mafia, such as Trump Soho, but that was left to Steele. </p>

<p>Russia was also not a focus of the election at the beginning of the election. By the time that Steele was hired, Russia was the main focus of the election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time will tell if the Dossier was used as the basis for the FISA warrant. What is disturbing, in my opinion, is that the two major things being used to justify the investigation behind the Trump/Russia election collusion claims are both based on potential fabrications. The DNC did not allow the FBI to their computers in response to the email hacks. The DNC used the company Crowdstrike who was started by an anti Putin Russian and they are the ones who concluded it was Russia behind the hacks. The other major item is the Steele Dossier which is political oposition research and not an intelligence report. Political opposition research is largely fabrication/ exaggeration and should not be taken as fact.</p>

<p>False.</p>

<p>Republicans paid for an investigation into Trump, <em>but</em>, and this is an important <em>but</em>, Steele wasn&#39;t hired to create the dossier until <em>after</em> Democrats started paying for the investigation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simpson, as fellow journalists remembered, smelled fresh red meat. And anyway, after all he had discovered, he’d grown deeply concerned by the prospect of a Trump presidency. So he found Democratic donors whose checks would keep his oppo research going strong. And he made a call to London, to a partner at Orbis he had worked with in the past, an ex-spy who knew where all the bodies were buried in Russia, and who, as the wags liked to joke, had even buried some of them.</p>

<p>You know what else has not been released after 6 months relating to Fusion GPS and the Steele Dossier? The 21+ hours of testimony that Fusion GPS gave to several committees. It shouldn&#39;t matter what your position of the Dossier is, everyone deserves to see those transcripts. Fusion GPS has stated publicly for months to release the transcripts. Committee heads have stated intent to release the transcripts.</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t they be released 6 months after they were recorded? What is being hidden in those transcripts?</p>

<p>You think Glen Simpson, Chris Steele or anyone in Fusion GPS would have access to FISA applications? The only people that would have access to those warrants would be the FBI, FISA courts, and the DoJ, and they are not going to release that info to the public.</p>

<p>From September 2015 to May 2016, Simpson was retained by a conservative newspaper, the Washington Free Beacon, to collect opposition information on presidential candidate Donald Trump.[6][7][8]</p>

<p>After the Free Beacon stopped funding the research, the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign&#39;s law firm, Perkins Coie, picked up the deal with Simpson’s company Fusion GPS.[7] In June 2016, Fusion GPS hired Christopher Steele, a former MI6 agent, to obtain information on Trump. Steele used his &quot;old contacts and farmed out other research to native Russian speakers who made phone calls on his behalf&quot;.[9] After November 2016, funding from the Democratic Party ceased, and Simpson reportedly spent his own money to fund further work on the dossier.[10]</p>

<p>On August 22, 2017, Simpson was questioned for 10 hours by the Senate Judiciary Committee in a closed-door meeting. The Committee did not release a transcript of the hearing. Simpson reportedly did not reveal the identities of his clients.[11]</p>

<p>This is false.</p>

<h3>Statement From 8/23/2017</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, Glenn Simpson spent the entire day answering questions of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee staff, pursuant to a written agreement from 
the committee&#39;s chair and ranking member that was reached some weeks ago. </p>

<p>Mr. Simpson told the truth and so far has been the only witness to fully 
cooperate with the committee. The transcript reveals all of Mr. Simpson&#39;s 
testimony based on the hours of questioning from staff.</p>

<p>The committee can release the transcript, if it so chooses. But after 
spending an entire day answering questions, and zero testimony from any 
other witness, calling Mr. Simpson to a hearing, I think he means an open 
hearing, serves no investigative purpose other than to try to find out the 
identities of clients and sources which are protected as matters of 
privilege and in the case of sources, protected as matters of safety.</p>

<p>We appreciate the opportunity to review the transcript and will do so. At 
the end of the day, that transcript is the committee&#39;s. It&#39;s not ours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is Simpson&#39;s public statement. He said one thing publicly while behind the scenes he was doing another.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Foy said Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson rebuffed the committee&#39;s request six months earlier to testify publicly and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination &quot;to negotiate for a closed-door interview.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Despite his public statements, Mr. Simpson and his attorney demanded during the interview that the transcript be kept confidential,&quot; Foy said. &quot;Mr. Simpson has refused to answer dozens of questions voluntarily, and has failed to provide the Committee with documents and responses to follow-up questions after the interview.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Committee’s invitation for Mr. Simpson to testify at a public hearing remains on the table,&quot; he added.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fusion GPS was up to some shady shit. They were involved with Manafort in his crimes. </p>

<p>The Podesta Group got so freaked out about Fusion GPS, they folded up shop and left town. One of the most powerful lobbying firms in Washington DC doesn&#39;t just close their doors out of the blue because they want to spend more time with the family.</p>

<p>Now that their bank records have been unsealed, the shit is about to hit the fan for Fusion and they&#39;re going to take a bunch more criminals down with them.</p>

<p>This is entirely false. Fusion GPS did no work with Manafort and did no work with the Podesta Group. </p>

<p>Fusion worked with HRGIF on behalf of Prevezon. I think this is what you are trying to recall if I am correct.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that can be true. </p>

<p>This still doesn&#39;t negate Grassley&#39;s promise to hold a vote to release the transcripts and his intent on voting for the release. This still doesn&#39;t negate Fusion&#39;s multiple requests to release the transcripts. We can never tell what happened unless the transcripts get released. I&#39;m sure you would love to see their transcripts to see all of the criminal activity they are involved in, right?</p>

<p>Do you want to see those transcripts? Wouldn&#39;t you love to see Fusion get exposed in their 21+ hours of testimony?</p>

<p>I think Fusion behind the scenes made a deal to keep those transcripts secret because of the names they named. The names they tried to keep secret by blocking access to their bank records.

<blockquote>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make any sense either. Podesta is much more likely to be afraid of relevations coming from Manafort and Gates. Fusion never worked close to Tony Podesta.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The names they tried to keep secret by blocking access to their bank records. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t want their bank records out because they were working previously for an NGO ran by Prevezon, which was accused of money laundering. They were previously working for what many would perceive as a corrupt organisation.</p>

<p>After the postelection publication of a dossier by a former British spy into those connections — which included some salacious claims — John Podesta met with Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the firm that commissioned the opposition research, to compare notes on Russia’s involvement, according to an associate of Mr. Podesta.</p>

<p>During the general election season, the firm’s research was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, though John Podesta has told congressional investigators that he had no knowledge of those payments. The associate said the meeting came as Mr. Simpson was considering whether, and how, his firm could continue its Russia-related Trump research. A spokeswoman for Mr. Simpson’s firm, Fusion GPS, declined to comment.</p>

Political opposition research was utilized by one political group to mobilize the surveillance apparatus against their political rivals.   That is easily the scandal of the century.  But it also implicates a lot of institutions that you simply can&#39;t criminally implicate in the US.  </p>

<p>I mean just think about this.  The dossier was compiled by an &#39;ex&#39; British intelligence agent, based on his &#39;Russian&#39; contacts.  This was shared with an FBI agent in Rome in July of 2016.   Last week you had Downer, an Austrilian diplomat come out, and say, no no guys, what really started this whole think was that drunk Papadopoulos said something about some emails that the Russians had. </p>

<p>The whole thing reeks like it is a 5-eyes operation to guarantee a particular outcome in the US election.  I mean we know that Clapper and Brennan acted politically against one political actor.  </p>

<p>The real scandal would implicate our own intelligence and the intelligence of Britain, and the rest of the 5 eyes basically running a domestic election op. </p>

<p>The FBI also had much more intel on Carter Page than what was included in the dossier.

We now know that Manafort was in constant contact with Kilimnik during the campaign about their debt to Deripaska and how they would be able to pay it off by selling Manafort&#39;s influence.</p></li>

<p>That is an allegation at this point that remains to be proven in a court of law.  Why are you bringing up Manafort now,  Manafort could be guilty of all of those things, but if he was indirectly busted by the surveillance warrant that was justified by political opposition research, Manafort is going to walk. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need a FISA warrant to get people&#39;s bank records. This doesn&#39;t make any sense. Nothing in Mueller&#39;s indictment on Manafort is from a FISA warrant.</p>

<p>You will eventually see more about Manafort&#39;s discussions with Oleg Deripaska and Konstantin Kilimnik over their $30 million debt and the events during the RNC platform change. That is where a FISA warrant would be useful. </p>

<p>Nope, I purely brought up Manafort&#39;s FISA warrant because it was relevant to the topic of FISA warrants. Very simple connection. I still stand by Manafort&#39;s warrant being entirely valid.</p>

<p>If the investigation finds non money laundering crimes committed, like influence peddling to settle a debt to Oleg Deripaska with help from GRU officers, would that be good use of a FISA warrant?</p>

<p>The dossier accused him of meeting with Sechin, you already know this, and that &#39;little&#39; detail is completely false, but let us see who he met and why.</p>

<p>Page:  I met Andrey Baranov, a long time friend who was at Gazprom and moved to Rosneft. He is in investor relations. </p>

<p>Quigley: Did you talk sanctions?</p>

<p>Page:  I don&#39;t recall, maybe, but in a broad context. </p>

<p>Quigley:  What were you dong?</p>

<p>Page: Watching the world cup.</p>

<p>Schiff:  Did you discuss with Brenov a potential sale of significant percentage of Rosneft?</p>

<p>Page:  I can&#39;t remember, maybe he mentioned it in passing because it was in the news at the time, but I had no involvement. </p>

<p>It claimed that Page met with Sechin. He didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>The dossier did not claim that he met with an old friend from investor relations, who is now the head of that department, and maybe they discussed the sale of Rosneft and maybe they discussed sanctions while watching a football claim. </p>

<p>Meaning Page had no idea that he was in contact with SVR. So why would you use this as an excuse for justifying further surveillance, illegally unmasking his name, and leaking it to the press.  I don&#39;t need to remind you that there were 2 additional Americans who were not unmasked. </p>

<p>Again, for people who can read. The dossier claims he met with Sechin, and that lifting sanctions and sale of Resneft shares was discussed. </p>

<p>Page did not meet Sechin, he met a long time friend who is in investor relations at Rosneft and they watched a soccer match.  The corroboration is contained in Page stating that maybe they discussed the sale of Rosneft in passing, it was in the news, he can&#39;t recall, but he certainly was not offered shares for a quid-pro-quo.  In other words the key facts of the dossier where false.  At this point the word corroboration is equivocated, and I suspect most sane people can see through the political chicanery. </p>

<p>Please post a detail from the dossier that is corroborated, because claiming that Page met with Sechin, while in truth he met with an old friend that woks in investor relations is not a small detail. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the events described occurred, barring a name change or a title change, then the dossier has had claims corroborated</p>

<p>You read it here folks.  I mean it does not matter Page does not meet with who the dossier says he met.   Keep it up. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah they were left alone because those 2 americans that were attempted to be recruited by the SVR never accepted their advances and gave them any documents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are just making things up now.  We have no idea the extent that SVR interacted with the female in the financial industry.  We do know that Page emailed back and forth and passed documents concerning the energy industry.  Not classified material, publicly available energy information concerning the energy industry of which he is a part of to someone he did not know was an SVR agent.  </p>

<h1>Kalugin Claim</h1>

In addition, State Department staff who dealt with Russia did not come across Kalugin, as would have been expected with a simple diplomat.

<ol>
<li><p>The claim from the dossier is that Kalugin fled (pre-dossier release) because Russia feared he would be caught up in the FBI counter intel investigation due to his role in the election meddling. There was no press release at the time of his departure, so there would have been no reason for the public to have known about this.

<p>No, I am saying that the dossier contains a claim, that Kalugin left, which is made is the middle of September.  He left in August.   That he left is not a confirmation of the dossier, I hope that is at least obvious, as the dossier is written after the fact.

    <div class="md"><p>The dossier again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MFA official reported that as a prophylactic measure, a leading Russian diplomat, Mikhail KULAGIN, had been withdrawn from Washington at short notice because Moscow feared his heavy involvement-in the US presidential election operation, including the so-called veterans? pensions ruse (reported previously), would be exposed in the media there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dossier could not even get the diplomats name right!   </p>

<p>I am getting it because the drama about Kalugin is only a result of the dossier itself.  But thanks for the link to the BBC piece which contained this nugget:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not clear if the American intelligence agencies already believed this when they got Steele&#39;s report on the &quot;diplomat&quot;, as early as May 2016. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Steele was feeding info way before July as alleged by NYT. </p>

<p>You are just making things up now. We have no idea the extent that SVR interacted with the female in the financial industry. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except we do. You yourself have said you read those wiretaps from the SVR.
The SVR agents admit they can&#39;t get anything from the female recruits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On or about April 8, 2013, IGOR SPORYSHEV, the
defendant, made the following comments to VICTOR PODOBNYY, the
defendant, during a recorded conversation in the SVR NY Office about
potential intelligence sources being targeted by the SVR.
The potential source referred to as &quot;Female-1&quot; below was a female
employee of a financial consulting firm in New York City.
The potential source referred to as &quot;Female-2&quot; below was another female
recruitment target located in New York City:</p>

<p>IS: With [Female-1], we started that I needed answers to some
questions, answers to which I could not find in open sources.
Due to that I am interested to find information from paid
publications and opinions of independent people who discuss
these topics amongst themselves behind closed doors .
There was a positive response without any feelings of rejection.
But there was a problem with [Female-2]
<strong>I have lots of ideas about such girls but these ideas are not actionable
because they don&#39;t allow to get close enough.</strong> And in order to
be close you either need to fuck them or use other levers to
influence them to execute my requests.
So when you tell me about girls, in my experience, it&#39;s very rare that something workable will come of it.</p>

<p>In addition you know that there where university students that  stated information was attempted to be solicited from, my point was that we DON&quot;T KNOW THE CONTENT of their interactions, and even if we did, IT WOULD NOT MATTER. Unmasking them in a case that is closed is illegal, and leaking their names to the press would have been wrong. </p>

<p>Which is neither illegal, nor rare, there are many Americans and American companies involved in the energy industry.  This on its own is not enough to justify either a FISA warrant, or an illegal unmasking. </p>

<p>And US intellgience, and Israeli intelligence, and international hedge funds, etc.  What is not disputed is that there is corruption in the Russian oil sector. What is disputed is whether an interest and business dealings in this sector are enough to justify surveillance, or illegal unmasking after the case is closed, and a leak to the press. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not enough on its, but having SVR agents possess that intel that you are very eager to join Russian oil projects would be used as further pull for them to recruit Americans to become assets. Even this still would not be enough on it&#39;s own, but US intel agencies would clearly see this as the SVR using Gazprom deals to recruit Page further.</p>

<p>The CIA also has the capability to spy on people like Igor Sechin and his associates, and would be able to intercept discussions they have about what Page was doing in Moscow and what he discussed with Rosneft executives. If they were able to determine from intercepts that an American was benefiting from the brokerage sale of Rosneft and was conducting secret negotiations on sanctions that involved Rosneft execs, then they could unmask Page further and legally place a FISA warrant on him.</p>

<p>The CIA would make the whole thing up to pursue a political goal.</p>

<p>To kind of wind down this discussion.  We have seen that my interlocutor can&#39;t back up his assertion that the dossier has been verified, when an attempt is made, we find out that corroboration means stating something completely wrong,  or making a claim about an event after the fact, and being quoted itself as evidence that the claim is corroborated. </p>

<p>This subject is where our investigative efforts should be.  How was the FISA warrant justified, and who is responsible.   There is a scandal underneath to make the laws tremble. </p>

<p>During a night of heavy drinking at an upscale London bar in May 2016, George Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, made a startling revelation to Australia’s top diplomat in Britain: Russia had political dirt on Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear. But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians’ role.</p>

<p>a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, made a startling revelation to Australia’s top diplomat in Britain: Russia had political dirt on Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>A startling revelation?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Clinton cache of e-mail correspondence in the hands of the Kremlin or other hostile intelligence agencies could represent one of America’s greatest intelligence disasters, giving Vladimir Putin the opportunity to determine the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election or, barring that, to cast a cloud over a Clinton presidency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The risks posed by Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while US secretary of state have been dramatically underscored by the disclosure of five attempts to break into her computer by hackers apparently based in Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was being talked about as a strong possibility in the media for months before this alleged &quot;startling revelation&quot;.</p>

<p>By the way, that last story is hilarious. In it, it mentions that Clinton was completely against the idea of Russians hacking <em>her</em> server and denied it... because that would have made her look bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><h3>Claim</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking in July 2016, a Russian source close to Rosneft President, PUTIN
close associate and US-sanctioned individual, Igor SECHIN, confided the
details of a recent secret meeting between him and visiting Foreign
Affairs Advisor to Republican presidential candidate Donald TRUMP, Carter PAGE.</p>

<p>According to SECHIN&#39;s associate, the Rosneft President (CEO) had raised
with PAGE the issues of future bilateral energy cooperation and
prospects for an associated move to lift Ukraine-related western
sanctions against Russia. PAGE had reacted positively to this demarche
by SECHIN but had been generally non-committal in response.</p>

<p>In terms of the substance of their discussion, SECHIN&#39;s associate said that the Rosneft
President was so keen to lift personal and corporate western sanctions imposed on the
company, that he offered PAGE associates the brokerage of up to a 19 per cent
(privatised) stake in Rosnett in return PAGE had expressed interest and confirmed that were TRUMP elected President, then sanctions on Russia would be lifted.</p>

<h3>Evidence Proving One of Carter Page Allegations</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Stephanopoulos pressed, &quot;It sounds like, from what you&#39;re saying, it&#39;s possible you may have discussed the easing of sanctions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Something may have come up in a conversation,&quot; Page replied. &quot;I have no recollection, and there&#39;s nothing specifically that I would have done that would have given people that impression.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MR. SWALWELL: Dr. Page, which individuals who did you meet with in
December 2016 in Russia?</p>

<p>MR. PAGE: I didn&#39;t I had a brief lunch with Andrey Baranov as well.</p>

<p>MR. SWALWELL: My direct question to you and the direct answer I want is, what
did you discuss?</p>

<p>MR. PAGE: Yeah. We talked about general markets and also -- you know, I was
planning to give a speech, you know, for New Economic School and the media the following
day, and so I asked them for Some thoughts about my speech.</p>

<p>MR. SWALWELL: Did you talk about the 2016 election that had just happened a
month earlier?</p>

<p>MR. PAGE: They expressed general -- yeah, it came up, and they expressed
general interest in it.</p>

<p>MR. SCHIFF: And when you met with Mr. Baranov, you met with him in July and
you had lunch with him in December. Is that correct?</p>

<p>MR. PAGE: Yes. .</p>

<p>MR. SCHIFF: And in July, did you discuss with him the potential sale of a significant percentage of Rosneft?</p>

<p>MR. PAGE: I don&#39;t believe so. He may have mentioned it in passing.</p>

<p>MR. SCHIFF: Did you ever express support for the idea of lifting U.S. sanctions on Russia with Mr. Baranov?</p>

<p>MR. PAGE: Yeah. No serious discussions about anything </p>

<p>MR. SCHIFF: But you may have had discuSsions that you wouldn&#39;t characterize as - serious?</p>

<p>MR. PAGE: The topic ?just like someone may have mentioned tax policy in
November 2017 in Washington, there may have been an analogous brief mention in
Moscow in July 2016. Briefly, yeah.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even understand why it would matter if the dossier was used to get the warrant. There have been 4 criminal indictments so far and the investigation isn&#39;t even over. The dossier was originally paid for by republicans and then the Hillary campaign took over when Trump got the nod. If Trump paid for opposition research and it led to taking down 4 criminals in Hillary&#39;s campaign, absolutely nobody here would be complaining. Like let&#39;s say after Trump paid Project Veritas to go after Hillary&#39;s campaign, imagine if they found criminal activity. Then imagine the FBI looked into it and criminally indicted 4 people, including her campaign manager. There wouldn&#39;t be a single person here complaining about how it all went down. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand why political opposition research being utilized to justify one of the most massive surveillance systems in the world was used against a political opposition party?

<p>NO, no they are not justified.  There are minimization rules in place for American citizens, just being caught up in a conversation is not enough to unmask.  And if anybody reads the actual transcript it becomes immediately obvious that it would not be justified.  Nor would it be justified to unmask the other 2 Americans that remained masked simply because they had unknowing contact with SVR.  It certainly would not be justified to unmask them and leak their name to the press.  It is an abuse, it is illegal, it is a scandal, and someone is going to be held accountable for it. </p>

<p>You are right, there are requirements, like <em>agents need to demonstrate probable cause to believe that the &quot;target of the surveillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power.&quot;</em> Manafort has lots of documentation in his indictment showing he was acting as an agent for Yanukovych&#39;s Ukraine and for Putin&#39;s Russia. There is also lots of documentation showing that Manafort was in debt $30 million during the campaign to Oleg Deripaska, someone who was shown to be paying for Manafort to represent Russia as a foreign agent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From CNN:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is CNN Fake News that can&#39;t be trusted? Or is it now gospel? If it&#39;s gospel, I can find a whole bunch of shit that will upset your feelings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI last year used a dossier of allegations of Russian ties to Donald Trump&#39;s campaign as part of the justification to win approval to secretly monitor a Trump associate, according to US officials briefed on the investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we now know that the dossier was just independent corroboration of evidence that was already used to start the investigation. Trump&#39;s foreign policy advisor set the investigation into motion by blabbing to (at least) the Australians.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is Abby Martin:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Who the fuck is Abby Martin?</li>
<li>Oh, she&#39;s a previous RT host (the Russian propaganda network that disguises itself as &quot;news&quot; so that Trumpists can muddy the waters in these types of investigations)</li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#39;s ignore the fact that nobody argued that Podesta hasn&#39;t performed lobbying activity. Paul Manafort was a lobbyist for the Russian government. It has now been shown that he is also a money launderer.</p>

<p>Let me guess: something something John Podesta satanic child pizza rituals, right?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>...unmasked appropriately! That controversy died as soon as it was shown that there was actually no wrongdoing. You just happened to gobble up Devin Nunes&#39;s deflection like a good boy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that you thought of T_D when reading our exchange, demonstrates that you are not capable of escaping partisan dichotomies.</p>

<p>Guarantee that there is an incredibly strong correlation between (1) every position you&#39;ve taken throughout this thread, and (2) the most frequently discussed trash on T_D. Taking the jump doesn&#39;t require partisanship, only the ability to do basic pattern recognition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure thing. Bury your head in the sand. It&#39;s worked pretty well in the elections since your papa won.</p>

<p>CNN is a tool of the national security state.  Start dealing with verifying claims and forget the notion of trusted sources. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And we now know that the dossier was just independent corroboration of evidence </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is like you folks are impenetrable to reading and comprehending what you read.  The dossier was not corroborated, nor did it corroborate previous claims, that were independently made previously.   The dossier is full of false information.   The NYT claimed that parts of the dossier where shard with an FBI agent in Rome in July, and per the BBC article, it states that Steele was feeding information to intelligence as far as back as May.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paul Manafort was a lobbyist for the Russian government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, Paul Manafort was a lobbyist for the Ukrainian government. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(the Russian propaganda network that disguises itself...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point my interlocutor really looses the plot.  Chris Hedges is a leftist, who got kicked out of the NYT for criticizing the Iraq war... you know made right judgments and was right about that foreign policy disaster.  Ed Schultz was kicked from MSNBC for being critical of the TPP, Larry King has a show, etc.  RT provides an outlet for the voices on the LEFT, that are not allowed in the corporate media.    But just so we have some points of comparison, here is Abby Martin on the Russian government activity in Ukraine.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZolXrjGIBJs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZolXrjGIBJs</a></p>

<p>Now you can post an anchor on a major MSM channel openly criticizing US foreign policy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...unmasked appropriately!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was unmasked from a case that already closed, (unmasked retroactivly), and it is clear from the transcripts, that there was no reason to unmask him. Folks, don&#39;t take my word on this. Read the transcripts.  Something my interlocutor has not done.  After, he was illegally unmasked, his name was leaked to the press, again in a case that was CLOSED!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That does not mean anything to either me, or people that care about inappropriate utilization of the surveillance apparatus, and they should not matter to you either.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Taking the jump doesn&#39;t require partisanship, only the ability to do basic pattern recognition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are not very good at pattern recognition, if you haven&#39;t noticed that last election and the year after basically boiled down to a 5 eyes domestic op. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s worked pretty well in the elections since your papa won*.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not a Trump supporter. He is not my Papa.   Strong pattern recognition skills you do not have. </p>

<p>Funny... Fusion GPS doesn&#39;t say that. They say that the dossier wasn&#39;t used to &quot;trigger the investigation&quot;... but what is unsaid is that the dossier might not have triggered the &quot;investigation&quot; but still have been used to get the warrant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But Papadapulous told an Australian diplomat that he knew Russia had dirt on Clinton months before wikileaks dropped it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. Australians <em>claim</em> Papadapulous told them that - coincidentally around the same time that Obama agreed to take the Australian&#39;s &quot;refugee problem&quot; off their hands.</p>

<p>But it is also false for another reason - prior to this alleged meeting, Hilary Clinton&#39;s personal server had been hacked, and there was indications that Russians had been involved.</p>

<p>Remember - &quot;dirt about Clinton&quot; can easily refer to <em>her</em> email server, rather than the DNC emails hacked later. We know that many of the emails on Clinton&#39;s server were intentionally deleted rather than being handed over to investigators. It is very possible the Russians have those emails.</p>

<p>In fact that was the big scandal at the time - Trump calling for the Russians to release the deleted emails.</p>

<p>This latest load of bullshit is an obvious attempt at &quot;retconning&quot; the reason Trump&#39;s team were subjected to surveillance because the &quot;dogdy dossier&quot; has been proved to have been a creation of the Clinton campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Hillary was now being investigated just as throurougly as Trump is being investigated and both of them are found very guilty. Then I&#39;m sure there will be this clusterfuk of people supporting their party and saying &quot;well the other side did illegal shit,&quot; and then both of them will be set free.  I can almost guarantee you this will happen just judging by how unconventional the whole Trump era has been.</p>

<p>This is why that these dumbass republicans should wait for Trump&#39;s to be done and ask for Hillary to be investigated with actual legit reasons. But they know what they are doing, there&#39;s a reason why people are claiming this is just them using it as a distraction. If Hillary did do some illegal stuff, and she walks free then no one can be blamed but the republicans.</p>

I&#39;d like to point out though that the US state security apparatus using flimsy or convenient excuses to justify surveillance and sabotage of political actors and moments is something that&#39;s happened repeatedly over the last century.  Leaving aside the specifics of this situation for a moment, its important to remember that these fears are not new, and state security intervention has had several profound impacts on our political direction, and as long as the US maintains such a massive, self-important, and uncheck security apparatus such intervention will be an ever present threat to our democracy.</p>

<p>Actually, more of it appears to be true than false.<br/>
Note that the dossier predicted a low level Trump staffer would travel to Russia to work on the sale of 19.5% of Rosneft. Low and behold, Carter Page, a low level Trump worker traveled to Russia and met with Rosneft. 19.5% of Rosneft traded hands.  Furthermore, at Trump&#39;s foreign policy dinner, all of the principles in the transaction were present, including Sessions, who lied about it under oath.
A second example is the pee-pee tape.
The dossier says Trump had 3 hookers urinate on the bed that Obama slept in.  Trump&#39;s bodyguard has testified that Trump was offered 3 hookers in the hotel, but that to his knowledge, Trump didn&#39;t accept the offer.</p>

<p>None of this is proof, but at some point, you have to acknowledge the surprising coincidence that this represents.  Even a Trump die hard supporter must acknowledge that his behavior is not that of an innocent man with nothing to hide.</p>

<p>Finally, the fact that a high percentage of the sources believed to be connected to the dossier have had unfortunate accidents is at least troubling, right?  The number of coincidences are remarkable in this story.</p>

<p>Rosneft/ Carter Page
This story is utter nonsense, not worthy of a wacky conspiracy theory of an alien invasion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To offer Trump either the entirety of, or a brokerage commission on, the market value of 19.5% of Rosneft shares—even a 6 percent commission on $12 billion worth of Rosneft shares would amount to an astonishing $720 million—would deplete the cash that Putin desperately needed for military spending and budget deficits, all in return for a promise to lift sanctions if—and what a big “if”—Trump were elected. Rosneft, as a public company, would have to conceal that the U.S. president was a party to this major transaction. This remarkable secret-of-secrets seems to be bandied about to an Orbis “trusted compatriot,” a senior member of Sechin’s staff, and disclosed by Sechin himself. I guess there are a lot of loose lips in Rosneft offices.</p>

<p>No. Among Americans, Trump is the least popular president in history. Among the Western World he is considered a total embarassment, a &quot;monster,&quot; has cost us our leadership position in NATO, and has the rest of the Western World wondering wtf is going on in this country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without acknowledging all dodgy stuff Trump and his people have doing to warrant the investigation, to claim this post is non-partisan complete bullshit. </p>

<p>If there was no corroborating evidence of Trump&#39;s aide contacting Russia and knowing about Russia having emails from the Clinton campaign, while another a known target for FSB asset recruiting, or that his campaign manager was a long time Russian agent who launder millions, the dossier would have the impact it does. Only in the full context of all the evidence can you judge whether the FISA warrant is justified or not. </p>

<p>We also don&#39;t want to set a precedent of Russia hacking into political parties and then releasing damaging information on just one of them to elect the other one, but most people who believe the narrative that the dossier was an elaborate plot setup in case Trump won (an outcome neither Obama, Clinton or Trump expected), just completely close off their eyes and ears to finding any truth to whether Russia was involved in hacking the DNC and helping Trump. Wikipedia was doing good by releasing damaging info (timed for political damage), Republicans using their position to investigate Clinton for years out if political motivation, these are supposedly exposing corruption. Documents that are the starting point to showing that Trump had many connections to Russia, showed that his campaign manager was working for Russia for years while laundering millions, his son met with Russian government lawyer to get dirt on Clinton and talked about sanctions and tried to lie to the public about it, his national security advisor was making deals with Russian and Turkish diplomats, his campaign aids talking to Russians about Clinton emails before the DNC even knew it was hacked - this exposure must be stopped because it&#39;s corruption!!!! Where has the OP acknowledged that the Trump administration is a dirty organisation that need to be exposed as much as the Clinton people? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying that Hillary Clinton paid Christopher Steele to contact the FBI and falsely accuse her political opponent of a number of very serious federal crimes -- many of which have been corroborated, and none of which have been proven false -- even though in doing so, Christopher Steele was putting himself at risk for lifetime imprisonment, minimum? How much does something like that cost?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that&#39;s not what I was said. It was when Clinton&#39;s money came into the picture that Christopher Steele became involved. To be honest I&#39;m not quite sure how the dossier was brought to the attention of the FBI. I have heard that McCain brought it to them, but again I&#39;m not quite sure. I do believe that those questions are being asked though.And despite the FBI&#39;s reluctance to answer such questions and submit related documents to the committee that oversees them, the threat of being held in contempt lit a fire under their asses and things are starting to be answered behind closed doors. Yesterdays referring of Steele to the DOJ for potential violations by Grassley and Graham is very interesting to me as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What we know already is the Clinton campaign paid for the dossier </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clinton paid for it <strong>after Trump won the nomination</strong> which was long after this FBI investigation was open. </p>

<p>Prior to that GOP opponents to Trump were paying for that. Why do you ignore that fact?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was the dossier used as intelligence in a FISA court to get a warrant to surveil the Trump transition team?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Potentially but it&#39;s been stated that the dossier only corroborated information the FBI was already receiving from foreign intelligence agencies. </p>

<p>From what I recall the FISA warrant wasn&#39;t issued until the summer of 2016 and we know that Australia had already notified the US in the spring. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe you dislike Trump and you don&#39;t care</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think there are a lot more folks <em>who like Trump</em> and <em>don&#39;t care if the dossier is true</em>. </p>

<p>Most of the non-Trump supporters see the dossier for what it is and assume that there is gonna be a lot more evidence than that to get anywhere.</p>

<p>If Trump is innocent, I hope we find that out ASAP. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>gather information on their opponent and then pass that information to the FBI to have their opponent spied on?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, but if all you had was <em>inaccurate info</em> the chances of you getting that warrant would be slim. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not a partisan issue, this is about government corruption</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please help me understand how this indicated government corruption? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are lots of questions unanswered about the dossier, but its really been blown massively out of proportion.  All campaigns do research on the opposition.  They all dredge up any dirt they can from any source they can in an effort to smear or otherwise discredit their political opponents.  Frankly the dossier was just another of countless pieces of oppo-research.  It was deemed so flimsy and unsourced that even the Trump-hating media outlets rejected it when Fusion GPS and Steele tried to shop it around.  It was only after Hillary-friendly intelligence agents in the government briefed Trump that it was deemed legit to report on because it was &quot;potentially blackmail&quot; (whether or not any of it was true or provable).  It was then in turn used by Obama admin officials as an excuse to &quot;unmask&quot; Trump campaign people in wire intercepts that the NSA vacuums up unconstitutionally.  </p>

<p>The real issue here isn&#39;t the dossier, its that the government and the media can act together to push propaganda that whips up massive segments of society to believe things.  We saw the exact same movie with the run up to the war in Iraq.  We see the exact movie with North Korea and Iran.  Unfortunately most people are empty vessels just waiting to be filled with propaganda.  Things that are otherwise completely unimportant and irrelevant suddenly seem worth slaughtering millions of people over.  Countless millions of Americans are locked in cages, sleeping on the streets, living in poverty, or one paycheck away from homelessness.  We&#39;re $21 trillion dollars in debt nationally and much more on every level.  The fact that a single American is concerned with Russia or North Korea or Iran or any country on the other side of the world when our own country is fiscally and morally bankrupt and our people are suffering horribly is a sickening indictment on our society and our population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why hasn&#39;t the government—the FBI—ever independently verified the hack into the DNC? They solely relied on the findings of a private entity that was paid by the DNC.</p>

<p>The Clinton&#39;s funded Steele and Fusion GPS to come up with the Dossier. We hear claims that parts of the dossier have been verified and when you actually look into which parts you find that none of the allegations about Trump have ever been verified—only that X person did meet with Y person on such and such date. That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>So many conflate the FBI investigation into Russian meddling—which started in July 2016—with Mueller&#39;s investigation into the Trump campaign and they are actually two separate things.</p>

<p>So you have the investigation into Russian &quot;meddling&quot; whose basis are findings the government has never verified and then you have the investigation into the Trump campaign revolving around a dossier in which no allegations against Trump has been verified.</p>

<p>It stinks of a witch hunt. </p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>IF the FISA warrant happened to provide information on US citizens.   Once you are listening,  how can you listen only to foreigners.    You listen to both.</p>

<p>Are they going to put Susan Rice on the stand?    Are all these hearings going to be in secret.</p>

<p>Because investigations in the US are partial,  a sham,  the real issues are never going to be clearly laid out.    Its just a very stupid circus of fools.</p>

<p>Well do a thought experiment and imagine if you are a democrat, and the republican party pays for some opposition research, by which they get the members of the DNC to be spied on, and then selectively leak and spin the findings of the investigation through the MSM.</p>

<p>If you are a democrat that runs an organisation that employs convicted Russian mafia associates, you deserve every single bit of scrutiny.</p>

<p>If you are a democrat that hires a campaign manager that only worked for extremely corrupt Ukraine and Russian oligarchs that contributed to a civil war that killed 1000&#39;s for the past 10 years, your campaign manager should be placed under a FISA warrant.</p>

<p>So is CNN Fake News that can&#39;t be trusted? Or is it now gospel? If it&#39;s gospel, I can find a whole bunch of shit that will upset your feelings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CNN is a tool of the national security state.  Start dealing with verifying claims and forget the notion of trusted sources. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And we now know that the dossier was just independent corroboration of evidence </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is like you folks are impenetrable to reading and comprehending what you read.  The dossier was not corroborated, nor did it corroborate previous claims, that were independently made previously.   The dossier is full of false information.   The NYT claimed that parts of the dossier where shard with an FBI agent in Rome in July, and per the BBC article, it states that Steele was feeding information to intelligence as far as back as May.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paul Manafort was a lobbyist for the Russian government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, Paul Manafort was a lobbyist for the Ukrainian government. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(the Russian propaganda network that disguises itself...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point my interlocutor really looses the plot.  Chris Hedges is a leftist, who got kicked out of the NYT for criticizing the Iraq war... you know made right judgments and was right about that foreign policy disaster.  Ed Schultz was kicked from MSNBC for being critical of the TPP, Larry King has a show, etc.  RT provides an outlet for the voices on the LEFT, that are not allowed in the corporate media.    But just so we have some points of comparison, here is Abby Martin on the Russian government activity in Ukraine.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZolXrjGIBJs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZolXrjGIBJs</a></p>

<p>Now you can post an anchor on a major MSM channel openly criticizing US foreign policy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...unmasked appropriately!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was unmasked from a case that already closed, (unmasked retroactivly), and it is clear from the transcripts, that there was no reason to unmask him. Folks, don&#39;t take my word on this. Read the transcripts.  Something my interlocutor has not done.  After, he was illegally unmasked, his name was leaked to the press, again in a case that was CLOSED!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Guarantee that there is an incredibly strong correlation between (1) every position you&#39;ve taken throughout this thread, and (2) the most frequently discussed trash on T_D.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That does not mean anything to either me, or people that care about inappropriate utilization of the surveillance apparatus, and they should not matter to you either.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Taking the jump doesn&#39;t require partisanship, only the ability to do basic pattern recognition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are not very good at pattern recognition, if you haven&#39;t noticed that last election and the year after basically boiled down to a 5 eyes domestic op. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s worked pretty well in the elections since your papa won*.</p>

<p>I am not a Trump supporter. He is not my Papa.   Strong pattern recognition skills you do not have. </p>
