<p>Our ability to measure is recent, however the mediums that we can apply those techniques are ancient. Ice core samples, for example, provide us with ancient levels of gases over a time period. </p>

<p>Try to think without thought terminating cliches.  No one thinks we know everything there is to know, but we know enough to make statements with different levels of certitude and accuracy.

<p>Okay so when comparing the Co2 (in red) to the temp (in blue) you can see periodic divergence between the proposed relationship.  It&#39;s most noticable during the peak periods but it&#39;s also present during the small ups and downs in minor glacial periods and minor interglacial periods.</p>

<p>While some sort of correlation is obvious between co2 and temperature, it&#39;s not obvious why temperatures would decline rapidly without a decline in Co2 first and especially if Co2 is being blamed for the warming trend we are currently in which has been happening for the last 12,000 years.</p>

<p>Its not really noticeable for the peaks except for the initial one, but I did notice how you did not answer the simple questions I asked.  </p>

<p>What were the measured peaks of CO2 levels in the Ice cores? What is the C02 level now?  How fast did the changes occur in the past, vs now?  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is immediately obvious... If the energy input from the Sun decreases, then even with the same CO2 levels, we would see a decrease in temperature. </p>

<p>Perhaps you don&#39;t have any curiosity about what the data actually states, but maybe other readers do.  I am sure by now they notice how the questions of CO2 levels and rates of change have been avoided.  </p>

<p>But here is Petit on what the actual data showed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sequence of events during terminations III and IV is the
same as that previously observed for terminations I and II. Vostok
temperature, CO2 and CH4 increase in phase during terminations.
Uncertainty in the phasing comes mainly from the sampling
frequency and the ubiquitous uncertainty in gas-age/ice-age differences
(which are well over 61 kyr during glaciations and terminations).
In a recent paper, Fischer et al.44 present a CO2 record, from
Vostok core, spanning the past three glacial terminations. They
conclude that CO2 concentration increases lagged Antarctic warmings
by 600 6 400 years. However, considering the large gas-age/iceage
uncertainty (1,000 years, or even more if we consider the
accumulation-rate uncertainty), we feel that it is premature to
infer the sign of the phase relationship between CO2 and temperature
at the start of terminations. We also note that their discussion
relates to early deglacial changes, not the entire transitions.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What the data actually states is that there is a correlation but causation isn&#39;t clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The causation of CO2 being a greenhouse gas is based on physics, not analysis of previous trends.  </p>

<p>Do you deny that CO2 is a greenhouse gas?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ike Al Gore&#39;s missing ice caps, the data isn&#39;t pointing to run away warming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You misunderstand, both the Gore claim, and what is meant by runaway warming.  Models predict a range of possibilities,   the fact that some models predicting an ice free arctic soon were wrong, in no way entails that all models are wrong.  Runaway climate change refers to initiation of positive feedback loops, which in turn initiate other positive feedback loops.  Increasing C02 in the atmosphere leads to increases in temperature, which in turn cause permafrost to thaw, releasing large deposits of methane into the atmosphere. Methane is a a lot more potent greenhouse gas.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have all seen the climate gate emails and the IPCC omitting data, and NOAA filtering out certain data sets for &#39;reasons&#39;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well we have certainly seen how the denier community distorts what actually occurs with the IPCC or insider disagreements on NOAA not having their data in a publicly verifiable database or using low confidence intervals.    The double standards are obvious.  Any mistake is taken as a confirmation climate change is not happening, but the large amount of lies, distortions and propaganda coming from the denier camp is invisible. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can look at the Vostok data ourselves and see that the Co2 theory which cap&amp;trade is built around is off the mark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that a particular policy is bad, or disingenuously presented does not mean that the actual science is not right. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can see the increase in solar activity but the climate shame just doesn&#39;t stop. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a false dichotomy.  Solar activity and greenhouse gases are factors in the climate.  The question is what is occurring now, why, and what should be done about it?   You can read the actual review of Solar Activity and its influence on the climate here:</p>

<p><a href="http://solar-center.stanford.edu/sun-on-earth/2009RG000282.pdf">http://solar-center.stanford.edu/sun-on-earth/2009RG000282.pdf</a></p>

<p>And here is their conclusion after, going over the data:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>here have been suggestions that twentieth century
global and hemispheric mean surface temperature variations
are correlated to longer
‐
term solar variations. Advanced
statistical detection and attribution methodologies confirm
that solar forcing contributed to the increase in global
temperatures in the early part of the century, but for the
latter part of the twentieth century they consistently find that
using realistic variations, solar forcing played only a minor
role in global warming, in agreement with the practically
constant mean solar forcing since 1980.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t confront the fact that their predictions just aren&#39;t holding water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One only needs to look at trends in sea ice volume in the arctic, or the frequency of extreme weather events to see how off base your statement is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if other readers are interested in the climate change consensus view then there are no less than thousands of resources which will spoon feed them with it, little cartoons and rebuttals to copy paste</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As opposed to graphs provided without context and reference coming from the oil and gas funded denier fronts. </p>

<p>I hope readers would notice by now that CO2 levels peaked at around 300ppm and the troughs were at about 120ppm, with the difference occurring over thousands of years. The average C02 concentration today is around 406 ppm, we were at 300ppm around 1910. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to be the conclusion that is entailed if one subscribes to neoliberal ideology.  I mean if you believe that the market is an information processor, and that those closest to it have better insight into what is true - that would be those who got wealthy.  Then climate change is just another problem where a market can be created, and different products (geoengineering techniques) can be attempted, and through competition, a product will be delivered... no more global warming.   That is the prize for all the libertarian think thanks, in the mean time they just push global warming denialism  to buy some time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are totally mistaken.</p>

<p>We have records of how much oil humanity has pumped.  60% of that amount was burned by us.  That amount exactly matches the rise in atmospheric CO2 to record levels of 400ppm from 280ppm in 1940s.  It is simple accounting and chemistry to verify that we have drastically changed the atmosphere.  There is literally no question about it.</p>

<p>Humans may be tiny, but we build machines that are more powerful than us and outlive us.  For example, nuclear bombs are made by humans and could change the climate permanently in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The idea that humans are inconsequential in the natural order is a complete delusion held by people who have certain cognitive limitations.  It&#39;s not really clear how to help people like yourself, but the best thing you could do for everybody else is not publish your opinions.</p>

<p>This is a common, completely false assertion. Climate change and global warming are two different things. Global warming refers to the overall, gradual, planetwide increase in average temperatures. Climate change refers to the effects of that overall warming, which are not uniform. It can be cold in New York while the Earth as a whole heats up. In fact global warming would absolutely result in harsher winters in some places.</p>

<p>This is a non-sequitor, as we act based on the knowledge we posses.  We don&#39;t say, &quot;I don&#39;t want a pacemaker for my heart block, because our scientific knowledge of cardiac physiology is going to change&quot;.   We act based on what we know.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming. A survey of authors of those papers (N = 2412 papers) also supported a 97% consensus. Tol (2016 Environ. Res. Lett. 11 048001) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science. At one point, Tol also reduces the apparent consensus by assuming that abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming (&#39;no position&#39;) represent non-endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would reject consensus on well-established theories such as plate tectonics. We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies.</p>

You could ask every one of them and their own thought on what constitutes change or not will be different.   </p>

<p>And even with this bullshit methodology, they STILL had to lie and use neutral opinions as &quot;agrees&quot;.   Fuck off with this shilling of lies.</p>

<p>Nothing is debunked, nor are there lies, well except the crap you deniers continue to peddle. </p>

<p>Here is Pew from 2015</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Views among these more narrow subgroups of AAAS members are quite similar to those for the 
sample as a whole. 
For instance, 87
%
of all the AAAS members in our sur
vey said they believe 
climate change is mostly due to human activity
, compared with 
88
%
of 
Working Ph.D. Scientists
, 
90
%
of 
Active Research Scientists 
and 93
%
of working Ph.D. 
Earth
scientists
who hold the same 
view

<p>Study after study show that those in the field do not doubt anthropogenic climate change. </p>

<p>Inserting fantasy and superstition into science is hilarious. That isn&#39;t how evidence works.</p>

<p>We do know with absolute certainty that no massive release of anthropomorphic derived carbon on even a single percentage point to the modern era has occurred in history. This is an incontrovertible fact. Humans in the modern sense have only evolved in the last 100,000 or so year. We know they didn&#39;t have automobiles, factories or coal-fired electric plants.</p>

<p>Doubting the current instances of anthropomorphic climate change is a political position promoted by natural resource exploitation industries and nothing else.

    <div class="md"><p>The argument is welcome by those that rule us. In actuality, you&#39;re right, the climate has always changed. It&#39;s fucking volatile when measured on a scale as long as the earth is old. However there are certainly changes we have been witness to that suggest that regardless if humans have anything to do with it the relative stability we&#39;ve enjoyed for eons is becoming less predictable. </p>

<p>Can we talk about what we are doing to proactively prevent massive casualties from happening in areas prone to these warm ocean sort of weather patterns? The Gulf coast? The SE coastal regions? And potentially the whole eastern coastal united states? Or do we just want to whip our dicks out and see who can piss the furthest?</p>

<p>How about a constructive conversation about protecting these problem areas like other countries have done on a massive scale? Maybe huge projects the likes of the hoover damn in scale? Because in my opinion these are the kinds of discussions we need to be having now instead of the fucking incessant bickering.</p>

<p>Natural disasters have always happened and always will.  The earth is a living, breathing organism that changes all the time.  But, it has always sustained life and likely will till the sun goes out.  </p>

<p>Something like the aftermath of Katrina should have never happened, not because a hurricane shouldn&#39;t happen, but maybe because building a city below sea level that close to the coast isn&#39;t a great idea, and then electing corrupt officials who instead of fixing and updating the antiquated levee system, passed the buck or pocketed the money and allowed it to fail.  It was a human error, but not human caused.  </p>

<p>Of course we should do anything we can to curb pollution, improve air quality in major cities, and alllll that stuff, but to pretend that global warming is #1 on the list of things to worry about like Obama said, is ridiculous.  </p>

<p>The ratio of forests to non forests is decreasing, and is doing so at increasing rates.   Perhaps an analogy would be helpful to show why your statement really does not say much.  If humans grow the most food they have ever grown, it does not mean that they don&#39;t starve.  All they have to do is consume more than they grow. </p>
