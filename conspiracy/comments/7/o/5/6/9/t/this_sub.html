<p>I don&#39;t feel that way at all.  I love smoking weed and talking UFOs.  I think politics have become popular here for a number of reasons.  Right now a lot of people think it&#39;s very important, so that&#39;s what gets upvoted.  I would probably enjoy a sub called r/conspiracyforlaidbackstonerdudes  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not about the weed and the ufos it&#39;s more about the takeover if this sub and the anger portrayed. It does not seem human to me and it most certainly does not seem like the people submitting for years in the past. It is just pure anger and messaging that is instantly portrayed in the headline. It is angry and it portrays a position in the headline always. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are on a conspiracy forum, I&#39;d be more worried if it didn&#39;t spark any emotion at all. Cause if it didn&#39;t no body would give a shit. People should be angry to certain degrees and express that anger in a healthy manner. Such as sharing your points of view with people. Freedom of speech and of expression is something that is great for society. Because if this outlet were to be taken away it doesn&#39;t magically take away those feelings. Then people will start to express their disdain in a more unhealthy manner. </p>

<p>So turn your gaze away if you can&#39;t bare the sight of it. But don&#39;t you dare try to silence it. That goes for who ever has something to say. SO long as they aren&#39;t inciting criminal activity. You battle words with words. You fight idea with idea. You don&#39;t try to bury the idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is this.</p>

<p>There appears to be an entitity or group of entities controlling not only this sub but the entire media spectrum for the sole purpose of creating fear and turmoil amongst people. It has reached the point ow where you would not even know if this games were designed by an AI or not.</p>

<p>All I am saying is that this sub used to be real and we used to just have gps and look at weird things like ufos(for example) </p>

<p>Now, things are angry. Headlines are angry. Headlines explain their whole argument within the banner. It is almost corporate and too professional. All the top posts have the same in your face writing style with capital letters for each word, all the headlines explaim the argument succinctly in one sentence, all the comments follow suit.</p>

<p>This is why I believe its an AI</p>

<p>I touch on a lot of weird topics like drugs and the Mandela effects and typically post when I&#39;m drunk and or high. So I delete my account after because I don&#39;t care about accounts and would much rather be anonymous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is the recognition of the brainwashing that I am trying to show you. Creating a &#39;new sub&#39; to &#39;drown&#39; out the anger isn&#39;t the answer.</p>

<p>What I am trying to do is show you that you are reinforcing the fear by seperating yourself from your common man by creating a hidden subset of opinions not allowed to be spoken.</p>

<p>Why is that an answer. Branching off, hiding, scared to speak your mind you create a small fraction where you can speak your mind at ease without fear. This is what I am showing you. Branching off into your own world where your precious opinions cannot be attacked and you are free from repurcussions in the off chance you could be thrown in jail or bombarded with an entity who wants to keep you in this state of mind is what i am saying.</p>

<p>This is the issue. In my opinion there are 2 possibilities</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You are afraid to speak your mind due to fear and want to branch off to no longer be scared or more likely</p></li>
<li><p>You are following an AI script designed to make you branch off due to fear.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The third option is to observe and reflect on this forum and the responses free of emotion and once there ask yourself why is this happening right now? </p>

<p>We absolutely can shape our reality with our mind and that is what your mind is. There is no one other than  you and you are creating reality for yourself. They just don&#39;t want you to learn this because it either allows them to gain from your pain or they don&#39;t want you to learn what you have. It is all designed to scare you but for what? Who are you scared of? What are you scared of? Has anything not worked out for you? It&#39;s a test. Or it&#39;s a chain but whatever it is and whoever is doing it they are creating a world of hate and fear that is not who you are </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been here for years as well, while it is different... going through the way back machine (looked at about 15 snapshots) the content really isn&#39;t all that much different, there was tons of political posts about the Obama administration conspiracies, 9 11 was consistently there as well which it is now... I think people are just narrowing in on the real conspiracy. We don&#39;t talk alot of the supernatural these days because it&#39;s like beating a dead horse,  how often do you want to go over that case of spontaneous combustion 30 years ago? How often you want to debate a blurry loch ness or sasquatch pic? Arguably these aren&#39;t even conspiracies since a conspiracy is a group of people acting together for a common cause... that other stuff is paranormal , and while suppression of paranormal info may be a conspiracy..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. However, the new York times article a bit the ufo was justification for all of the work of those of us crazy bastards who saw them over the years.</p>

<p>That article should have been celebrated as the holy grail that proves we were right. I have seen many ufos and know something is up, but the fact that the one article that supported all the years if research and being told I&#39;m nuts is just glossed over. It&#39;s not us man. I saw the ndaa act cause shit, the Panama papers the Boston bombing 911 all this trash... And the one story that shows that we were right about something in the front page of the new York times... No one was there... We were just alone.</p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s the lesson. But I have faith that the true lesson the true answer to all of this is that there is only you. And if you give in you are gone. But if you continue on and don&#39;t give in even in the face of an enemy of seemingly infinite power. That&#39;s the only way we can win. The answer all along is right here. We are in control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% my friend, from all the releases we&#39;ve had the last  few years from cia foia reading room where they themselves confirm half the the modern day conspiracies , the wikileaks stuff, UFO proof is a daily occurrence it seems.  Where&#39;s the media? Where&#39;s our representative in government? Obviously not sitting down and reading this stuff, I could speculate on a million reasons why they don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I feel like humanity is reaching a point though, where that chunk of humanity which has ignored all this information for whatever reason, is going to need to catch up in a bad way or else we will continue the cycle. Frankly the beast that has been created is immense, but it&#39;s constituents are all individuals.</p>

<p>I think a new philosophy has the potential to make it melt relatively fast, service to others has exponential net benefits I think we are only beginning to realize,  why might this be? Because this philosophy is a realization of oneness with the world, it&#39;s based on a bed of science which has been ridiculed for years and it&#39;s all converging with what philosophers have said through the ages it seems from Nikola tesla, Nassim Harriman ( r/holofractal ) ,Michael talbot, david bohm,  dan winters, marko rodin,  hermetics,  gnostics,  shamanism, hinduism (the bhagavad gita ezplains quite well) law of one, philip k dick, hell the CIA foia reading room has dozens of docs where their own scientists confirm themselves the non local oneness of our universe and I&#39;m using that term loosely and forgetting a thousand names, they just all seek to be pointing in the same direction</p>

<p>The fact is we&#39;ve been taken over by an entity and it turns us on one another and wants to create only anger fear loneliness etc the worst emotions and as soon as we try to come together and say hey fellas remember when we used to laugh and shit and be friends everyone gets all upset and angry</p>

<p>My question is to what end? To what end do you want to take this reality? I am happy hanging put and smoking weed and talking ufos and things but the second I even say such a thing I am immediately labeled as a phony or a dick or an idiot etc.</p>

<p>Why is that okay? Why is that the new norm? If you look at it it almost seems as though that is what they want and you know what fuck that man. We create reality. I create reality and u ain&#39;t going anywhere for a loooooong time</p>

<p>I am just trying to show people that even mentioning the possibility that some entity is dividing or creating false anger or fear or that this sub has changed in itself creates an onslaught of division and anger. </p>

<p>Why is this happening is my question. I have proven that this is a subject that brings out ALL of the angry people and I just am trying to show people that it is a true issue. Whether it is AI or not is another matter but I only ask why does it attack like this? To what end? And in my opinion it is AI and in my opinion the purpose is to instill the emotions of fear hate anger betrayal jealousy. The reason in my opinion is because we cannot manifest our reality properly under this diruess and allow the people with the knowledge of how to manifest with positive thoughts to take us down this path. </p>

Selling crack supplied by the government and going to jail for life? For life? The people that can do this to us by all means would take over this entire website. They would make us hate each other. They would make us feel pain. This is how they are.</p>

<p>But why is the question? We have established the fact that they will ruin us. But the real secret is why? What do we really have? Manifestation of reality is what we have</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read most of the comments. I&#39;ve been around reddit, oh since probably a good decade now. I&#39;ll make a new account if I get hounded by pests, so this one&#39;s recent. </p>

<p>I was wondering when I started checking conspiracy. Somebody mentioned the wayback machine. Checked there. Not much front page upvote activity until about 2012. For some reason I recall it was less over-ridden with politics but no it&#39;s pretty bad in the wayback. I guess it was always like that. And then you get the scrutinizing terrorist events. I thought I recalled there being more other types of conspiracy stuff. Not so much of this politics and terrorism. This is where all the negativity comes in. So much bickering about politics. Meanwhile, whoever&#39;s in charge, nothing changes, most countries will probably eventually go bankrupt. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve sort of tried to look into what&#39;s going on behind the scenes in the world with the conspiracy stuff, for a couple decades now. Things you don&#39;t hear about in mainstream news. How you&#39;d find out about things, might have been people who worked in top secret projects who&#39;d let you know what&#39;s going on. In recent decades, not as much of that happening.  </p>

<p>Some of these conspiracy nuts go at this part-time, and if there&#39;s nothing new, they still want more. So what do they do, they dig into whatever&#39;s going on. Meanwhile, there&#39;s not as much new material to uncover. So all you get is this bickering and negativity. No real proof about anything. Terrorist activities and they keep trying to dig into it for months later. They always think it wasn&#39;t how it was told in the news. Some kind of other nefarious motives. Who knows. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t seem to be too much new in recent years. I have a fair idea of what might be going on behind the scenes in the world. But none of it has concrete evidence. If there was, it would violate national security so it would be removed. You&#39;ll never find a youtube video. How I got informed was text files. Nobody has the attention span to look into that in recent years. They all want instant gratification. Better have your conspiracy evidence proof in a 15 sec gifv or they&#39;ll click next. </p>

<p>There&#39;s not that much new material but people want more. They want to upvote anything.. So what do you get, bickering. Not so much, &quot;substance&quot;. </p>

<p>Probably time for you to, &quot;tune out&quot;, like I have in recent years. You&#39;re informed, and won&#39;t find proof with more surfing youtube videos. What needs to be done, is somebody has to get big money and get power. Then they can get boots on the ground and uncover the truth. But, that would probably violate top secret classified national security material and you wouldn&#39;t be allowed to get it out there. If you&#39;d get deep too, they&#39;d easily snuff you. </p>

<p>So what do you want here.. Them to stop bickering about politics and terrorist events? That&#39;s all they have to go on these days. Nothing to dig up. </p>

<p>What you&#39;d need is some way to get minuscule audio and video recording devices behind closed doors. Nano technology. Cloaked so you can&#39;t see it. Little insect sized devices which could be waiting by the top of a door and when somebody opens it, it goes in. Then you could eavesdrop what these illuminati and political guys laugh about behind closed doors. But then, that would be against the law. Seems like any proof you&#39;d get, would be against the law. </p>

<p>How about other stuff.. You hear these nuts wonder about if there&#39;s a flat earth. In the news the other week, some guy had a rocket and was gonna check it out. Didn&#39;t hear what happened there. But, hey that was at least somebody who&#39;s trying to get boots on the ground and trying to see things with their own eyes. We&#39;d need more of that. You&#39;re wondering about something, you need big money to get into it and see what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>More research surfing around online won&#39;t find you the proof. Any actual evidence could easily be removed by &quot;them&quot;. Yet, this is all conspiracy enthusiasts try to do to try and figure things out. Surf around the internet. You&#39;ll never find evidence. So maybe it&#39;s time to shut &#39;er down and work towards how you can get big money instead. </p>

<p>As for this negativity everywhere.. Check google news. It&#39;s more like, what&#39;s the body count now? Scroll down and spot the negative keywords. In recent seasons I&#39;ve tuned out from even checking the google news. I know how it&#39;ll be. Always highly pessimistic. </p>

<p>I threw out my TV over a decade ago. Same hogwash going on there. Much better with less distractions. What else got the axe.. I don&#39;t have time to sit around and watch stupid sitcoms. How about those who watch sports, part-time. Even movies can take a good chunk of your time. I&#39;ll keep up with a few per season, that&#39;s it. I notice something with movies in recent years. Highly violent. I don&#39;t know what the deal is but it sure seems like what&#39;s going on with the google news. </p>

<p>And then you get dealing with people from the public or even those you know. They&#39;re all like they&#39;re at a funeral in recent years. This started with 9/11. Just kept getting more &quot;blah&quot; since. Then you give them &quot;smart&quot; phones, they&#39;re click zombies searching for a little dose of dopamine. Forget it trying to deal with anybody these days. They don&#39;t have the attention span and you&#39;re taking time away from their dopamine clicks. </p>

<p>The internet.. where do people go, less and less sites as time goes on. It seems like it&#39;s headed towards how that 2006 movie, Idiocracy was. Dumb as posts. Just check comments on youtube or soundcloud or anywhere. They&#39;re fucking retarded. With those smart phones you can barely grunt an emoticon, so I don&#39;t blame &#39;em. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but who cares about AI. Dealing with whoever from the general public is already like dealing with retards. Fuck it all, the whole internet, already. Shut &#39;er down like the TV. Enough fucking around with dumb shit like social networking, that&#39;s for sure. Walking on fuckin eggshells so you don&#39;t insult somebody and have your account disabled. Screw it, all those sites, and well here too. Everybody&#39;s so stuck-up and uptight. Take a look at any new tab. It&#39;s all fuckin 0&#39;s around here. Everybody&#39;s like they&#39;re &quot;on the rag&quot;. </p>

<p>Fuck &#39;em all, man. What you need to do is work towards how you can get big money. That&#39;s where the key is to all this. Then you can fix problems in the world. What you need to do is think, what would I do if I was a billionaire. Write &#39;em down, your business ideas. I&#39;m a couple decades in. Got 370 ideas now. And working on how to eventually get a few M and be able to get one going. Then I could do more. Sitting around being a fan of others won&#39;t get you there. So you have to shut off the addiction to distractions. </p>

<p>This surfing conspiracy shit is a part-time job. No new shit, so this has gone by the wayside as well. Politics.. whichever way you vote, the titanics will sink. What needs to be done is a new 3rd political party that actually fixes shit. Not this losing everywhere and inflation run amok. How about house prices. Nobody cares. Your grandkids will be fucked. Meanwhile, what are they busy doing, bickering about whoever&#39;s voted in like they did the previous ones. Nothing gets solved wasting your time complaining about politics. But, that&#39;s all you see going on around here. So fuck &#39;em all, everybody. lol. Shutting this down too. </p>

<p>ok so there&#39;s you clue of what you can do about this shit. Yeah this subreddit is fucked but the whole site is. They&#39;re retards. It&#39;s all gifv&#39;s. Dumb as posts. It&#39;s like a fuckin imgur. Any other site is inactive. So fuck the internet. Better do something soon because your grandkids will have less power and money will be worth less. So it&#39;ll be even more difficult for them to get out of the hole and stop the bad guys. Shut this shit off and work towards how you can stop the bad guys. ok. See ya. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Powers That Be have become so smug and sure of themselves and that the fix is so solidly in the bag, that they no longer hide in the shadows or worry about covering-up their tracks. </p>

<p>How can anyone not be angry when very real evidence and not just any suppositions about the possibility or ordinary people being lied to, manipulated and exploited to no end, start turning up all over the place?</p>

<p>Or that despite all the ridicule and heaps of abuse thrown our way that we were far more right and correct in our logic regarding our suspicions about that than we ever could have guessed?</p>

<p>We have been completely vindicated on any number of fronts and there is no denying that very real conspiracies against the public and it&#39;s best interests have been carried-out and covered up for decades on end by people in high places and there is now conclusive evidence to prove it.</p>

<p>What the present anger reflects is the desire for &quot;Justice&quot; and penalties that are equal to all the harm and damage that&#39;s been done and some indication that proper steps are being taken to prevent any more of it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be scared and even if you are don&#39;t admit it. We are all scared. The world is a bad neighbourhood. The only one coming to save you is you. The only one dieing with you is you. You are alone. You always will be alone. There is only you and you can&#39;t be scared.
