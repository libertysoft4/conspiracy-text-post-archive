    <div class="md"><p>Which begs the question why it is illegal to question the Holocaust in multiple European Nations. This is always a dangerous water to dip your toes in, but there are eye opening points made on the denier&#39;s side.</p>

<p>That being said, I still see the Catholic Church, Freemasons, and Knights Templar, Jesuits, etc. as being equal or greater threats to a progressive society. I used to argue that we should send all Abrahamic religious orders to some island, to <em>cough cough kill off</em> &quot;share their love&quot; for and with one another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gnosticism is not right. The thing I discovered over the 6 month obsession I had with reading the gnostic gospels is the fact that these books contradict with the rest of the bible. I believe they are false doctrines.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I don&#39;t have a problem with anybody taking Israel off the map. They are a terrorist state, who has concentration camps to this day, and even though I currently identity as Christian, I must admit that all three of those religions have been exploited to the point of having no dignity or right to hold any authorative power left, and need taken out of all control over any government or army.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4 In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has <strong><sup><sup><sup>not</sup></sup></sup></strong> overcome[a] it.</p>

<p>6 There was a man sent from God whose name was John. 7 He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. 8 He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.</p>

<p>9 The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. 11 He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. 12 Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— 13 children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.</p>

<p>14 <strong><sup><sup>The</sup></sup> <sup><sup>Word</sup></sup> <sup><sup>became</sup></sup> <sup><sup>flesh</sup></sup></strong> and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then I guess I&#39;ll have to risk offending you by saying I don&#39;t believe Jesus is literally the flesh and blood word of God, that needs to be worshipped. I just believe that there is a God, and God occasionally blesses mortals with higher knowledge- but they are still just vessels to pass the teachings. </p>

<p>I need to look up the actual Nag Hammadi scripture verse, but Jesus says something to the effect of, &quot;I am merely the vessel the wine (word of God) was poured into. We are here to talk about the wine, not the cups that we drink it from.&quot; Meaning don&#39;t treat him as special, only what he says as special. There is a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course the Nag would contradict Jesus own words in the bible. And this is the kind of doctrine of demons I am talking about. Believing in a God is not going to get you anywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This discussion is about to veer off into pissing you off at me, b/c you can probably be offended, and I cannot. </p>

<p>For starters, no one is going anywhere. There is no literal promise of mortals going to Godly heaven when they die. It is inferred from interpretation of multiple scriptures in multiple places. All we are promised is an <em>earthly</em> heaven, <em>after</em> Jesus comes back to make it.</p>

<p>People preach fire and brimstone, and loved ones being in a better place in heaven as left over medieval scare tactics. If you can&#39;t bait the horse with the carrot, break out the whip.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be the one getting upset here. I am simply responding to you. You can believe what you want but I don&#39;t see how you can believe that &quot;all we are promised is an earthly heaven...&quot; when you don&#39;t even know which passages of scripture you believe. And if you are referring the earthly heaven to God recreating the earth a 3rd time and bringing the new Jerusalem down from heaven to the new earth. Then sure, an earthly heaven is just fine with me. If you don&#39;t believe that being separated from God would be &quot;hell&quot; then okay, I do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pick and choose, and cherry pick- just like virtually every other person who picks up the book, for one reason or the other. </p>

<p>The irony I see right off the bat is that, that results in most Christians really living lives more akin to the Gnostic Christianity teachings anyway. Most take medicine when they are sick, as is believed in the Gnostic text, compared to more of the faith healing that is actually taught in modern Christianity. It&#39;s like a double edged sword. Heal the body and the soul independently but together. Faith, plus God given medicine (herbs) gives real healing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The investigation was almost 2 years later, under funded, only given the go ahead after families of the 9/11 victims started to make too much of a fuss, no one was ever convicted, no &quot;terrorists&quot; were ever photographed in any airport, on those flights.  We&#39;ve never been shown but a few frames of what hit the pentagon.  Many in high positions of power just happened to take a day off or be away from their posts, on the most important day of their careers.  Rumsfeld himself was out &quot;helping&quot; for hours instead of you know, running the country.  So helpful to have a geriatric when a base full of military were also there.  War games sent fighter jets into inexplicable places, unable to respond, just coincidentally for something like 2 hours.  There are literally thousands of coincidences, big ones.  The stock market, puts were way off normal levels.  Some leaving the trade center breaking leases, just before.  Ehud Barak just happened to be in London telling the world what the narrative needed to be, before the second tower even fell.  WTC power outages, security changes, etc.  Bush family members with strange close connections to security at the airports and the towers...  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not at all afraid to speak up about these things, but people don&#39;t listen or care. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;d require the debatee&#39;s definitely arguing in good faith and from a guaranteed factual position. </p>

<p>The opposition facing 911/Holocaust includes everything from honest questions regarding material properties and anomalies regarding involved parties; to claims regarding a world-wide jewish supremacy that urgently needs eradicating and any number of lurid descriptions of satanist atrocity.</p>

<p>Debating a part legitimizes the whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a counterexample: creationism. There&#39;s something that has no evidence to support it, and mountains and lifetimes of evidence to contradict it. Yet because some political interests value a belief in creationism, there are hundreds of millions of dollars spent on teaching this bizarre pseudoscience. Much more people today believe in young earth creationism than did fifty years ago. That&#39;s not because of evidence, that&#39;s because of effort.</p>

<p>While I agree with you that I&#39;ve seen people overreact to denialism, the truth is not as compelling as it should be. People with an agenda will always be able to brainwash others. </p>
