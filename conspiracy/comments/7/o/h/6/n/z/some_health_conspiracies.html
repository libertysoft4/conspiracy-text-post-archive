        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I posted some of this on a vaccine thread and the OP said it should have its own post so here goes.</p>

<p>Mercury isnt, and probably never was, the real problem with vaccines.</p>

<p>The problem with vaccines that i have never heard mentioned by those who want better vaccine safety, who are not actually anti-vaccine, but are always mislabeled as such is this:</p>

<p>Vaccines are immunomodulatory substances by design. Their introduction into the body causes an immune response, which should only be to make the immune system recognize the specific pathogen in the future.</p>

<p>However, some of the adjuvants and the fact that many vaccines are given simultaneously with others causes feedback loops of immune response which can disrupt the microbiome and the proteome.</p>

<p>This disruption of the microbiome and the proteome is characteristic of many autoimmune diseases. </p>

<p>I suspect that there is a link between the drastically increased incidence of autoimmune disease and chronic illness(something like 1/2 of all those over 18 have at least one in the US) and four things, which include unsafe vaccines and vaccine schedueling.</p>

<p>Unsafe vaccines and too many at once leading to microbiome and proteome dysregulation and pathogenesis of the microbiome itself.</p>

<p>Biosolids fertilizer used on food crops. Most people dont know what this is, but it is lightly treated human sewage with everything that gets flushed in addition to literal human shit: cleaning supplies, prescription drugs, pathogenic viruses and bacteria of all kinds, radiotherapy, chemotherapy that is excreted and flushed. Heat treating it may inactivate the  bacteria or viruses in it but they are still immunomodulatory like the inactive vaccine pathogens and have uncontrolled immune effects.</p>

<p>If you have never heard of biosolids fertilizer and dont know what it is, be prepared to be grossed out when you find out what gets sprayed on your food, including &quot;organically grown&quot; food.</p>

<p>GMO crops that include cross kingdom genes which express novel proteins like plants that have bacterial genetic material that could never occur in nature for example. Which is why there is a problem with a lot of current GMOs. </p>

<p>GMO technology is not inherently bad, like vaccines arent inherently bad. Its like any other product: there are good versions and shitty dangerous versions. Current GMOs make the food better for the people selling it by allowing it to be sprayed with carcinogenic Glyphosate or they have genes that cause food crops to produce their own pesticides.</p>

<p>These chemicals dysregulate the microbiome which leads to immune system dysregulation downstream. Specifically look at the increases incidence of bowel related autoimmune disease since the introduction of GMOs in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Food additives that would have to be labeled as powerful drugs if it werent for a loophole that allows toxic chemicals to be labeled as &quot;spices&quot; or even &quot;natural flavor&quot;. A lot of these are basically addictive drugs designed to get people hooked on eating shit quality food that maximizes profit margin at the expense of the people eating said food, like current GMO tech does. Google neurological food additives for more information.</p>

<p>Those four things i just listed were all introduced in the late 80s to early 90s. </p>

<p>Is it coincidence that people are sicker now than ever since those four things have been unleashed on the unsuspecting masses? I really fuckin doubt it!</p>

<p>I also dont ascribe pure evil to the people who are behind this. It makes them rich, and getting rich at the expense of others is hardly far fetched tin foil hat territory.</p>

<p>Also consider what happens once people are indoctrinated into this anti health lifestyle. They end up sick and then drug companies can sell them chemotherapy infusions that suppress the symptoms of their Chrons or whatever and eventually give them cancer, giving them another opportunity to sell them treatments and seldom cures. And lets not forget how this leads to depression, allowing the sale of drugs that are worse than placebo at treating depression, but have a good chance of making the victim dependent, fat and unhealthy.</p>

<p>Its another form of slavery like debt slavery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to add that the vaccines on the CBC schedule are NOT tested for safety in conjunction with each other. Again, the childhood schedule as a whole is not tested for safety. </p>

<p>So like you said, vaccines might not be inherently bad, but when you put eight at one time into a baby, along with all the other environmental factors you mentioned, it could be a problem for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be very difficult to do a real assessment on the effects of mixing all the pathogens and adjuvants with each other, combined with the variations in microbiota from person to person.</p>

<p>People should realize that the microbiome, the innate immune system as well as just the functioning of the human body itself is an incredibly complex system that has inbuilt feedback and feed forward loops which if dysregulated can have amplified negative outputs. When there are too many variables to accurately model the interaction of, such as multiple pathogenic organisms interacting with adjuvants, interacting with the microbiome and proteome in vivo, its best to err on the side of caution.</p>

<p>It also means that the behavior of these things studied in vitro will have very little commonality  with their behavior in a living individual. You can &quot;prove&quot; something is safe by setting up your experiment a certain way, even if it is incredibly dangerous in a real world use scenario.</p>

<p>That is always the go to defense for pro vaccine pro GMO &quot;religion of science&quot; but clueless about actual science types. They scream &quot;correlation is not causation!&quot; and back up their claims with data dredged bogus &quot;studies&quot; that cant be repeated. There is a massive replicability crisis happening in the scientific community right now. I am pretty sure someone recently posted about it actually.</p>

<p>Good point about evil not necessarily being the intent. There might be evil in there, maybe even at the top, but it&#39;s a fair bet that most people are driven more by optimization of profit than anything else.</p>

<p>I have to say, I was definitely in the camp a couple years ago. I knew nothing about vaccines or GMOs, but MSM &quot;science&quot; said it&#39;s so and I unquestionably went along with it.

    <div class="md"><p>Wash your produce with filtered water for one. Try to research the companies that you buy from and see if they use it. I could write a book on things to avoid when it comes to food. </p>

<p>To mitigate some of the issues it causes, you need to have a healthy gut microbiome. Having a compromised gut microbiome often means increased intestinal wall permeability, which allows stuff to get into your bloodstream that shouldnt.</p>

<p>Specific probiotic bacteria can help decrease gut permeability. Lactobacillus rhamnosus is one of the best for this purpose, and is well researched. Its a human strain probiotic, as opposed to a soil borne organism probiotic. I should emphasize that specific probiotic bacteria are beneficial for gut health, but it is inadvisable to indiscriminantly take &quot;probiotics&quot; because taking the wrong bacterium can be detrimental to your microbiome. </p>

<p>Certain strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacteria are beneficial, and found in the human gut naturally, but the balance of these bacteria in the gut can be thrown off by illness, diet, antibiotic use, etc. When the good bacteria are depleted, it allows pathogenic bacteria to colonize the gut, which itself causes a feedback loop of bad bacteria producing conditions that are conducive to pathogenic bacteria thriving in the gut, with inflammation and increased intestinal wall permeability.</p>

<p>Reintroducing good bacteria in sufficient quantity over sufficient time can help reverse those conditions as well as preventing some of the bad stuff from biosolids fertilizer from getting through your guts natural defenses.</p>

Again, if we look at any traditional diet, we will see unpasteurized vegetables consumed.

I would have to try to find the efficacy study, but from memory Culturelle and Jarrow were both good. They contained viable bacteria in the advertised quantity and had good quality control. Jarrow is also one of the companies that makes probiotics in capsules that survive the stomach acid and only dissolve once they get to the small intestine, releasing their payload where its supposed to end up. I personally alternate between both coated and normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a biologist, I can say that nothing in your post has been proven false except</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unsafe vaccines and too many at once leading to microbiome and proteome dysregulation and pathogenesis of the microbiome itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t have access to databased except public ones like pubmed and ncib, but there have been many studies trying to correlate vaccination with autoimmune disorders including Crohn&#39;s and all have come up negative or inconclusive. And vaccines are one field where failure to find a correlation actually gets published.</p>

<p>So far as biologist can tell, nothing we vaccinate for should be in the gut microbiome, and there&#39;s no shared markers between what we vaccinate for and healthy gut microflora. </p>

<p>Now, you can and do postulate that over activation of the immune response causes inadvertant identification of healthy gut microflora by the secondary immune system. This is a workable hypothesis but again, the studies on this topic have not shown a correlation.</p>

<p>If it sounds like I&#39;m defending vaccines it&#39;s because I am, in general. Vaccines play a key role in preventing antiviral and antibiotic resistance, and all the research I&#39;ve ever seen has not correlated them to any health problem. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying &quot;vaccines are free of complications&quot; is a false statement. What I&#39;m saying is that &quot;vaccines have not been shown to have complications&quot; is a true statement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Vaccines have not been shown to have complications&quot; is a true statement? I do believe that there is a conspiracy to make that seem like it is a universal consensus even though its not.</p>

<p>As i said before, i am not anti vaccine. Vaccination is a great technology, but the state of medicine for the masses is piss poor, even in developed countries. Vaccines are no exception.</p>

<p>With the state of technological advancement in terms of computing power, medical analytics and AI, doing studies on the hypothesis i put forth about the downstream effects, which could take years to manifest and would likely go unnoticed in a conventionally done study, should be verifiable.</p>

<p>AI and graph analytics are getting quite good at finding patterns and correlations in unstructured data that would otherwise go unnoticed. </p>

<p>Its not like doctors or experts have ever said that something was safe that turned out to be unsafe... right?</p>

<p>Like cigarettes or asbestos or any of the drugs that get recalled constantly with those annoying &quot;did you take x drug? Well we found out its deadly, so call 1800 sue the shit out of them now!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Add one more item to the growing stack of published medical literature linking vaccines to the current explosion of autoimmune diseases from skin afflictions to neurological disorders. A paper published in October 2015, the journal Pharmacological Research is an international team of immunologists’ roundup of current findings on vaccine-induced disease&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;“Vaccines and autoimmunity are linked fields,” state the authors led by Luísa Eça Guimarães of the Zabludowicz Center for Autoimmune Diseases in Tel-Hashomer, Israel. Just as natural infections can sometimes induce autoimmune disease, so can vaccination induce autoimmunity that “may be severe and fatal.”</p>

<p>Autoimmunity can manifest acutely, as encephalitis for example, or in a wide range of disfiguring and debilitating immune-mediated illnesses from alopecia to multiple sclerosis. These are soaring globally and together affect as many as one in five Americans today. Officials like those at the National Institutes for Health and the Centers for Disease Control claim some mysterious unidentified “environmental” factors must be responsible for the epidemic, but they obstinately refuse to look at the ever-increasing schedule of injected drugs that target the immune system.</p>

<p>In the paper, the immunologists review current research and case studies of vaccine-induced autoimmunity in light of the new the concept of Autoimmune Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants introduced by leading immunologist Yehuda Shoenfeld in 2011. The ASIA model explains adverse events that have been linked to vaccination since it began according to new understandings of the mechanisms by which vaccine ingredients called adjuvants take effect. Adjuvants are designed to stimulate the immune system but in some individuals can trigger a cascade of immune reactions and symptoms (ASIA) that can eventually manifest as overt autoimmune disease.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the same cited paper, emphasis mine:</p>

<p>&quot;In conclusion, there are several case reports of autoimmune diseases following vaccines, however, due to the limited number of cases, the different classifications of symptoms and the long latency period of the diseases, <em>every attempt for an epidemiological study has so far failed to deliver a connection</em>. Despite this, efforts to unveil the connection between the triggering of the immune system by adjuvants and the development of autoimmune conditions should be undertaken. Vaccinomics is a field that may bring to light novel customized, personalized treatment approaches in the future.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The studies for the correlation are there, they are far cheaper and easier to perform, whereas at epidemiological level it&#39;s very hard to prove, and huge sums of money would be required to fund it even for just once substance of the vaccine such as Aluminum.  The pharmaceutical industry doesn&#39;t want to fund this for obvious reasons, as they would be likely shooting themselves in the feet.  Fortunately experts are now crowdfunding for half a million US dollars to get the studies on Aluminum done.</p>

<p><a href="https://patientdanmark.dk/private-forces-to-raise-funds-research-into-aluminium-in-vaccines/">https://patientdanmark.dk/private-forces-to-raise-funds-research-into-aluminium-in-vaccines/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Private forces to raise funds for research into aluminium in vaccines</p>

<p>Aluminium salts in vaccines are suspected of causing a range of side effects. This is particularly true for the newest generation of salts.</p>

<p>Authorities and pharmaceutical companies have yet to shed light on the problem and do not seem interested in doing so. For that reason, a private, global crowdfunding campaign is being set up in Denmark to collect the funds necessary to facilitate independent research into the effect of aluminium in vaccines, including the debated HPV vaccine.</p>

<p>A new committee composed of national and international experts, as well as affected individuals, has been set up under Patientforeningen Danmark. In addition to believing that the subject has not been properly illuminated, the committee fears an increase in the number of affected individuals if we are kept in the dark.</p>

<p>Amongst others, the committee consists of the English professor and aluminium specialist, Christopher Exley, the French top researcher and neurologist, Dr Roman Gherardi, the Danish actress with a son affected by vaccine side effects, Lone Hertz, and the initiator, Mette Kenfelt, whose daughter came within inches of death in what was presumed to be the side effects of the HPV vaccine.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.factcare.dk/en/factcare/">http://www.factcare.dk/en/factcare/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Let us attempt to restart the debate about vaccines&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is about the fact that aluminium might be poisonous to the body.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is about the fact that it is not obligatory to test aluminium adjuvants in vaccines.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We wish to create a neutral overview of our current knowledge of the consequences of using aluminium as an enhancer in vaccines, including HPV vaccines.</p>

<p>A  group of prominent researchers within the subject area have come together to go through the international literature on the subject in a systematic manner. This will include all trials and articles within the field. No research has carried out a systematic review of international literature on the types of aluminium salts used in vaccines.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you&#39;re gut is part of your immune system. How it would be unaffected by activating test immune system by vaccines seems impossible.</p>

<p>&quot;Until recently, if most people thought about those bacteria at all, we tended to think of them as fairly separate from us. They help with digestion, but otherwise they stay on their side of the intestinal lining, and we stay on our side. But, in fact, there is a lot of interaction between the body’s immune system and bacteria in the gut. Researchers at Johns Hopkins are now in the early stages of figuring out how the composition of the gut changes in different diseases, how the body’s immune system interacts with these tiny hitchhikers and particularly how that relationship may function in disease.&quot;</p>

<p>And science is still in the early stages of understanding this interaction:</p>

<p>&quot;A huge proportion of your immune system is actually in your GI tract,” says Dan Peterson, assistant professor of pathology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “The immune system is inside your body, and the bacteria are outside your body.” And yet they interact. For example, certain cells in the lining of the gut spend their lives excreting massive quantities of antibodies into the gut. “That’s what we’re trying to understand—what are the types of antibodies being made, and how is the body trying to control the interaction between ourselves and bacteria on the outside.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i probably could have added wheat and sugar, but specifically high fructose corn syrup, to my list. I hear &quot;wheat is only bad if you have Coeliac disease&quot; repeated constantly.</p>

<p>The processed wheat that people typically eat is loaded with gluten, which is poorly hydrolyzed by humans. That causes inflammation in the intestine and increased permeability when the poorly hydrolyzed gluten interacts with the intestinal tissue. Theres apparently evidence that Type 1 Diabetes can be related to gluten consumption as well. Onset of T1D also correlates with a profound reduction in diversity of intestinal bacteria.</p>

<p>The best evidence for high fructose corn syrup being a conspiracy was the agribusiness companies&#39; own bullshit &quot;its the same as sugar and ok in moderation&quot; commercials. No one would need to make such bullshit commercials if it was actually a safe product. </p>

<p>Oh shit those commercials remind me of the other repackaged industrial waste that is sold as food: Canola. Someone did a thread about Canola oil on here recently.</p>

<p>So far, widely publicized conspiracies have been exposed (as in mass-media, government hearings AND peer-reviewed journals ) 
for all the risk factors we have mentioned - sugar, wheat, canola, margarine, antibiotic-treated meat and dairy, industrial vegetables (salmonella, etc) industrial grown salmon  and tilapia, etc. etc. The FDA and any other mass health expert have completely discredited themselves.
Then again, intermittent fasting is an outstanding existing method of cutting inflammation and extending the lifespan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but on the other hand, that feeling you get by giving the finger to the system by dropping out is indescribable. 
I protest vote just for le shits and giggles, but the bigger difference I make is not buying their narrative. 
Dropping out sure saves a lot of energy.
I just have to not talk to echo-chamber people, politics and mass-media dictated conversation is pointless, which is easy enough, sooner or later they ask about why I am skinnier and in better shape than them, and sometimes their eyes do open after hearing what I DO not consume.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and others have shown that biosolids can contain measurable levels of synthetic organic compounds, radionuclides and heavy metals. USEPA has set numeric limits for arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and zinc but has not regulated dioxin levels.</p>

<p>Contaminants from pharmaceuticals and personal care products and some steroids and hormones may also be present in biosolids. Substantial levels of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) polybrominated diphenyl ethers were detected in biosolids in 2001.</p>

<p>The United States Geological Survey analyzed in 2014 nine different consumer products containing biosolids as a main ingredient for 87 organic chemicals found in cleaners, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and other products. These analysis detected 55 of the 87 organic chemicals measured in at least one of the nine biosolid samples, with as many as 45 chemicals found in a single sample.</p>

<p>In the United States the USEPA mandates certain treatment processes designed to significantly decrease levels of certain so-called indicator organisms, in biosolids. These include, &quot;...operational standards for fecal coliforms, Salmonella sp. bacteria, enteric viruses, and viable helminth ova.&quot;</p>

<p>However, the US-based Water Environment Research Foundation has shown that some pathogens do survive sewage sludge treatment.</p>

<p>EPA regulations allow only biosolids with no detectable pathogens to be widely applied; those with remaining pathogens are restricted in use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s go through this, try to separate reality from fantasy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mercury isnt, and probably never was, the real problem with vaccines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is true. The real problem with vaccines is morons who convince themselves they are dangerous and endanger themselves and people who cannot get vaccines for medical reasons, wasting time, money, and potentially lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem with vaccines that i have never heard mentioned by those who want better vaccine safety, who are not actually anti-vaccine, but are always mislabeled as such is this:</p>

<p>Vaccines are immunomodulatory substances by design. Their introduction into the body causes an immune response, which should only be to make the immune system recognize the specific pathogen in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, that is how vaccines work. Not really sure how vaccines working as intended is a problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, some of the adjuvants and the fact that many vaccines are given simultaneously with others causes feedback loops of immune response which can disrupt the microbiome and the proteome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t find anything supporting this, so I suspect OP made it up because it uses big words so it sounds plausible. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This disruption of the microbiome and the proteome is characteristic of many autoimmune diseases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is true, but once again, vaccines do not disrupt the microbiome, so it is irrelevant to the topic of vaccination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I suspect that there is a link between the drastically increased incidence of autoimmune disease and chronic illness(something like 1/2 of all those over 18 have at least one in the US) and four things, which include unsafe vaccines and vaccine schedueling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe you should have listed the four things, but let&#39;s see what they are. And just so we are all clear, chronic diseases include things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and depression. It is pretty much a catch-all term for long-term health issues, so claiming they are all caused by four things would be impressive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unsafe vaccines and too many at once leading to microbiome and proteome dysregulation and pathogenesis of the microbiome itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t find anything supporting this, so I suspect OP made it up because it uses big words so it sounds plausible. I am sure there is a made-up link to chronic diseases as well, but fortunately for us, our health is not made-up, so it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Biosolids fertilizer used on food crops. Most people dont know what this is, but it is lightly treated human sewage with everything that gets flushed in addition to literal human shit: cleaning supplies, prescription drugs, pathogenic viruses and bacteria of all kinds, radiotherapy, chemotherapy that is excreted and flushed. Heat treating it may inactivate the bacteria or viruses in it but they are still immunomodulatory like the inactive vaccine pathogens and have uncontrolled immune effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lightly treated is a stretch. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/biosolids-laws-and-regulations">There treatment is heavily regulated by the Clean Water Act</a>, <a href="http://www.virginiabiosolids.com/pdf/Pathogens%20in%20biosolids-2010.pdf">here is a study showing the regulations are effective at removing contaminents</a>. I don&#39;t see why this would cause any chronic diseases, or any diseases in general actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have never heard of biosolids fertilizer and dont know what it is, be prepared to be grossed out when you find out what gets sprayed on your food, including &quot;organically grown&quot; food.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is literally nutritious dirt. It goes through the same decomposition process as dirt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GMO crops that include cross kingdom genes which express novel proteins like plants that have bacterial genetic material that could never occur in nature for example. Which is why there is a problem with a lot of current GMOs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t find any examples of cross-kingdom gene transfers. Usually traits are taken from similar or the same species to ensure they work as intended. I don&#39;t know what &quot;problem&quot; you are talking about, maybe you should clear that up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GMO technology is not inherently bad, like vaccines arent inherently bad. Its like any other product: there are good versions and shitty dangerous versions. Current GMOs make the food better for the people selling it by allowing it to be sprayed with carcinogenic Glyphosate or they have genes that cause food crops to produce their own pesticides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not seeing how GMOs are harmful to people. Even if glyphosate was a carcinogen, <a href="http://www.who.int/foodsafety/jmprsummary2016.pdf">(it isn&#39;t)</a>, that would be harmful, not the GMO itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These chemicals dysregulate the microbiome which leads to immune system dysregulation downstream. Specifically look at the increases incidence of bowel related autoimmune disease since the introduction of GMOs in the 1990s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t find any evidence that chemicals created by GMOs change the microbiome, although it is perfectly reasonable that changing the microbiome would lead to IBS. A much more reasonable alternative hypothesis would be the increasing amount of sugar in our diet and overuse of antibiotics is leading to increasing rates of IBS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Food additives that would have to be labeled as powerful drugs if it werent for a loophole that allows toxic chemicals to be labeled as &quot;spices&quot; or even &quot;natural flavor&quot;. A lot of these are basically addictive drugs designed to get people hooked on eating shit quality food that maximizes profit margin at the expense of the people eating said food, like current GMO tech does. Google neurological food additives for more information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I googled neurological food additives, and found out that I shouldn&#39;t eat aspartame or things that are illegal to put in food. I am aware that there are some dangerous and potentially addictive substances in food, but their presence in food has nothing to do with GMOs. GMOs do not allow apples to make aspartame or carrots to make MSG. I am not seeing how GMOs lead to chronic disease.</p>

<p>I think those were your 4 things. None of them cause chronic disease. You make connections from vaccines, fertilizers, and GMO crops to things that do cause chronic diseases which do not exist. Big words an hand waving does not make it any better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those four things i just listed were all introduced in the late 80s to early 90s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its true that vaccines modern usage came about in the 80s. The 1880s, that is. Of course, they were a lot less safe back then compared to now. Biosolids fertilizer has been in use for as long as agriculture has been in use.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it coincidence that people are sicker now than ever since those four things have been unleashed on the unsuspecting masses? I really fuckin doubt it!</p>

<p>people are sicker now than ever</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN">That is the exact opposite of reality. Humanity is the healthiest it has ever been.</a> Also, you haven&#39;t demonstrated any link of your 4 things to chronic disease, so even if people weren&#39;t getting healthier, you couldn&#39;t blame your 4 things for that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also dont ascribe pure evil to the people who are behind this. It makes them rich, and getting rich at the expense of others is hardly far fetched tin foil hat territory.</p>

<p>Also consider what happens once people are indoctrinated into this anti health lifestyle. They end up sick and then drug companies can sell them chemotherapy infusions that suppress the symptoms of their Chrons or whatever and eventually give them cancer, giving them another opportunity to sell them treatments and seldom cures. And lets not forget how this leads to depression, allowing the sale of drugs that are worse than placebo at treating depression, but have a good chance of making the victim dependent, fat and unhealthy.</p>

<p>Its another form of slavery like debt slavery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, whatever. </p>

<p>Although you do bring up some real, evidence supported, science, they are usually unrelated or actually contrary to the points you are trying to prove. You make up links which don&#39;t exist and provide no evidence. This is as scientific as Harry Potter, and a lot less interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Despite the fact that you are obviously part of the cult of bad science and data dredged fantasy studies masquerading as legit research, ill actually bother replying, knowing it will go nowhere. Im bored atm.</p>

<p>First, i never said there is a problem with vaccines working as intended. I did not use any &quot;big words&quot;. If you consider a plain English description of dysregulating the immune system through the careless administration of immunomodulatory substances &quot;big words&quot; then you are out of your depth and googling your argument.</p>

<p>Our health is not made up? Yes, because people are generally so healthy now compared to a few decades ago before all this shit was in their food and being injected into them?</p>

<p>No, actually the incidence of chronic illnesses has skyrocketed in the last 30 years, obesity is a huge issue, and people are handed out prescription drugs like they were safer than eating properly and exercising. </p>

<p>Here are but a few of the cross kingdom GMOs that took a few seconds to google up. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.scidev.net/global/gm/news/gm-potato-uses-frog-gene-to-resist-pathogens.html">https://www.scidev.net/global/gm/news/gm-potato-uses-frog-gene-to-resist-pathogens.html</a></p>

<p> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_engineered_potato#NewLeaf">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_engineered_potato#NewLeaf</a></p>

<p>The problem with a lot of current GMOs is that they do in fact cause health issues. But enough data dredging and careful omission can make u healthy garbage like Canola oil seem healthier than olive oil in a bullshit study.</p>

<p>Glyphosate isnt a carcinogen if youre paid by Monsanto. Otherwise, it probably is.</p>

<p><a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i27/California-list-glyphosate-carcinogen.html">https://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i27/California-list-glyphosate-carcinogen.html</a></p>

<p>We all remember this guy too...</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ovKw6YjqSfM">https://youtu.be/ovKw6YjqSfM</a></p>

<p>Sugar and antibiotic over use are definitely also related to the amount of chronic illnesses as well.</p>

<p>You are(purposely?) conflating the use of manure, or herbivorous animal feces, and biosolids fertilizer, which is actual sewage. Sewage has not been used as fertilizer until recently. When it has been used, it has spread diseases.</p>

<p>Nutritious dirt my ass. Normal dirt is not sewage treated with chemicals and baked. It takes healthy soil much longer to form than that, and it is not derived from sewage filled with heavy metals and hazardous chemicals that get flushed, nor is it composed largely of the feces of omnivorous animals like humans.</p>

<p>Soil is largely the product of decomposed plant material, not the excrement of animals at all. Manure from cows has been used because it is relatively free of pathogens when handled properly and is plant based. Cow turds are fine fertilizer as long as the cows are eating clean grass, but human feces fertilizer has already been the cause of Hepatitis outbreaks among other things. Suspecting that all the pathogens that cant be completely broken down in the short treatment time before being sprayed directly on food, combined with the hazardous chemicals, might be causing microbiome and immune dysregulation is far fetched why? I suppose the Hepatitis outbreaks from sewage fertilizer are false?</p>

<p>TLDR fix your microbiome, avoid GMOs, inflammatory foods, flame grilled meat, wheat, soy, any produce from third world countries like China, factory farmed food and especially fish.</p>

<p>Eat a high quality unprocessed diet thats nutrient dense but low in calories. Also make sure your vitamin is safe and doesnt use industrial waste like the racemic form of vit E(dl-alpha tocopherol). </p>
