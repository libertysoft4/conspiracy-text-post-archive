<p>They choose Trump because Hillary Clinton had zero chance of winning unless her opponent was also a hated scumbag. <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/hillary-clinton-2016-donald-trump-214428">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/hillary-clinton-2016-donald-trump-214428</a></p>

<p>He&#39;s on the side of Israel, but so is his old friend Hillary. Either would forward a pro-Israel agenda, so they were covered no matter what. But Trump was pushed in to the general to make Hillary look more attractive by comparison, not because they actually intended on having him win. They covered their butts in case their semi-controlled opposition managed the win, but they weren&#39;t trying to make him win. </p>

If he really dropped the charade riots would ensue. His part like every presidents part is to be the face everyone either hates or loves while all the moves are being made behind closed doors by other people. He’s just there to keep a calm face and the funny thing is he can barely do his job as a puppet because he’s so incompetent. It shows in everything he does because he himself can barely contain it. He makes bush look like a rocket scientist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole &quot;friend&quot; thing is really interesting and you should ask yourself how one country came to be perceived this way?</p>

<p>Part of the answer is religion. When they set themselves up as a nation back in 1948, they could have chosen any name they wanted. But they picked &quot;Israel&quot; for some very important reasons. One, the most powerful nations on Earth (in 1948 as now) were mostly Christian.</p>

<p>This means most of the population is familiar with Israel from the Bible. Call your new country Zionistan and nobody gives a damn. Call it Judea (after the Roman province) and it&#39;s quaint. But call it Israel and suddenly Biblical history comes to life.</p>

<p>This is important for a couple of reasons. One, it gets religious people thinking emotionally instead of rationally. Two, it gets political leaders to fall in line because they know that (strong, unquestioning) support for Israel guarantees votes from religious conservatives during an election.</p>

If you where you&#39;d know as a kid, and adult if you stay with it, you learn a ton of history of the Jews and the region.

    <div class="md"><p>We’ve always hated them. We hated the Soviet Union right from the start due to their anti-capitalistic message. </p>

<p>Soviet Union as a country wasn’t fairing well from the start. Their implementation of communism was not working. They also had left a bad impression when business tried to pair up with them and were overly ambitious in their want to expand communism. </p>

<p>Stalin wanted more land to buffer western powers from harming the east. Russia had been involved in trouble for what? 100 years? He expanded prematurely and the west, primarily the U.S. opposed. </p>

<p>They expanded anyways and fought back against the us over the course of the Cold War through proxy wars and the ‘nuclear’ threat. </p>

<p>They held east Germany and disliked the west’s occupancy in Berlin due to it being rightfully within the easts territory. There was obviously hella tension. High members of the easts population fled to the west. Millions of civilians defected which is why the Berlin Wall was erected. </p>

<p>When Russia began, all the conflict had resulted in a loss of power and left the country and its people devastated. They started producing petroleum and natural gas at some point and regained stability. That’s p much all they were good at. </p>

<p>Soviet Union went poof. Russia centralized their industry to combat world banks to hinder transparency and still failed. No one wanted to get involved with them for trade or investments, America already had that covered. Then Putin rose to power and convinced businesses to invest and Russia now has steady growth. </p>

<p>America still hates Russia. They oppose any economic platform that doesn’t promote capitalism and used the tensions/maltreatment and misery of the Russian population under previous leaders to further the anti communism message and maintain world power. Keeping those tensions allows for public opposition to be low and for them to continue their agenda. </p>

<p>Israel was a great buffer state during he proxy wars for the U.S. and we have given them over $100 billion since we partnered up with them. They allow us to maneuver within the Middle East, promote capitalism, and a lot of people feel for the Jewish population. </p>

<p>We also push a primitive and discriminatory anti Muslim agenda to maintain power in the Middle East so furthering Israel as a power works for us too. </p>

<p>Why would America focus on something that benefits us when we could focus on the possibility of our ‘enemy’ doing scandalous things. It’s disinformation. It’s a control tactic. A distraction. </p>

<p>Hey guys, focus on this thing here and don’t pay attention or believe anything else. Come on guys. Look! We’re totally not doing anything ourselves. Wow did you hear what x did? How could they. We did that not even a year ago, but that’s not the point. They just did it and it’s so awful. </p>

<p>Like?? Idk. That’s my opinion from what I know about our allies and tensions with Russia. I don’t get it. </p>

<p>Like, okay everyone and every government does bad things to further their progress and benefit the country,  You can’t stop corruption or greed, esp in the world state we live in now. </p>

<p>Even if what they’re doing is not ethical it’s tech within their right with the social contract we all enter into for them to pursue ventures to secure our national security and economic prosperity. The other country has a just right to oppose and declare war, but they’re not powerful enough to make a difference. </p>

<p>Great. America is now #1. But the leaders and corporations don’t exactly provide us with enough of the countries entitled benefits to get away with this. And that’s why a lot of people are catching on and starting to notice things like you just asked. It also plays into how our taxes are being used, the excessive defense budget and how unequal our country is. </p>

<p>The majority of republicans who aren’t politicians want financial reform in regards to how our taxes are used, reforming social welfare programs, and privatizing certain industries bc they feel the government is not using their tax money efficiently and is wasting their hard earned money will accomplishing nothing. </p>

<p>Our roads are trash. Are public transport is trash. We owe trillions and a lot of the social welfare burden falls on taxes and the system keeps taking money that we don’t have and increasing our debt through the federal reserve. </p>

<p>A majority of democrats feel underrepresented, have to rely on those social programs to survive due to the wealth inequality and hate the corporations that make millions while investing overseas or within themselves instead of the economy. </p>

<p>They feel betrayed and left out and realize not only the disparity between classes within this country, but start to lose trust. Then they start forming different opinions and looking into things. We then find out a lot of information bc we want to be educated and understand why things are the way they are and then begin to question our leaders actions and motives.</p>

<p>Russia is heavily corrupt and that’s why they centralized, but their economy is growing and the population for the most part is happier than ever before. Their happiness raising is only like 3 points below America’s. Plus socialism is working in a few countries. </p>

<p>We push the anti Russian involvement narrative and ignore Israel and other governmental meddling bc Russia is a threat. Why incriminate yourself? No one is going to openly admit anything, but focus on who else is doing the same things to take the focus away from them. </p>

<p>Instead of America having to defend itself, we merely ignore the issue at hand and divert attention until it’s cleared up and say ‘hey look we did good. We are a better country now and we won!’ </p>

<p>TLDR; p much bc we need a distraction from our own policies and involvements and use Russia as the tensions from our proxy wars to further assert our control and punish Russia for being anti capitalism and causing so much trouble in the past. They’re a scape goat that we also can not trust.  They’re seemingly corrupt and not transparent so we don’t know what is going on and that bothers the western powers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your points about the US being against communism is completely and utterly false. Our Establishment, primarily the Council on Foreign Relations, were actually <em>pro</em>-Communists, secretly at least. They actually <em>helped</em> Communism take hold in the country, because to them, it was the perfect boogeyman to jumpstart their New World Order. </p>

<p>They helped Mao rise to power in China and GREATLY helped Stalin. When China was murdering millions of its own citizens, they extended actively promoted trade with them. </p>

<p>Another prime example is Vietnam. In the 1960&#39;s the Establishment was under heavy fire by the populace. Works such as <em>The Invisible Government</em> by former FBI Dan Smoot and <em>America&#39;s Unelected Rulers: The Council on Foreign Relations</em> by Kent and Phoebe Courtney started to expose what the CFR was and how much power they held (and still hold, if not more than they did in the past) in the US Government. They needed a distraction, one that would &quot;prove&quot; they were &quot;hard on Communism.&quot; What they gave us was an endless, dragged-out shit-show of a war in Vietnam.</p>

<p>I agree with the rest of your points however. It&#39;s just that the &quot;fight against Communism&quot; was a manufactured farce.</p>

<p>Highly recommend James Perloff&#39;s <em>The Shadows of War</em> if you want to know more.</p>
