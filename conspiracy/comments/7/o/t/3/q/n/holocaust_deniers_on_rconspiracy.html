<p>Really funny stuff there.  First, it&#39;s spelled &#39;Israel&#39;.  Second, they aren&#39;t suffering in any way that matters.  Just usual whinging.  They are the spoon fed babies of the entire planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until recently realizing how absurd it is, I had an ocean of sympathy.  At some point your sympathy does come to and end though.  You realize many genocides have happened throughout history, right?  For some reason, we are <em>only</em> to feel sorry for <strong>one</strong> group, because they make major motion picture after major motion picture.  9/11 used up all of my sympathy personally, and I don&#39;t care if you&#39;ve got a problem with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel did not exist during the holocaust, and furthermore, the holocaust is an emotional plea for nationhood and not a logical one.</p>

<p>There really is no Israeli suffering. They have it pretty good as the front-organization for some really rich men. Look at all the data. </p>

<p>It&#39;s GDP, size, population, and income distribution. It&#39;s essentially a prop. It gets paid to the tune of billions in aid, has rival competitive tech and weapons manufacturing subsidized, and then has total media relations control over narratives: Poor Israel. ..yeah, right.</p>

<p>This is how I saw though the rhetoric. </p>

<p>a) You&#39;re not aware Israel became a state in &#39;48, and the camps were liberated in &#39;44-45.</p>

<p>b) You&#39;re making emotional pleas for Israeli statehood based on the holocaust alone - Zionist dont need anymore help with this tactic.</p>

<p>-While virtue-signaling about holocaust denial. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Assuming all facts about the holocaust are accurate, given even academic discrepancies; a product common to all aspects of historical narrative meeting later historical research.</p></li>
<li><p>C) how did this suddenly become about Israelis? That&#39;s like you asking in regard to this question about Palestinians, &quot;why such disdain for Nazi suffering&quot;?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Think about the logical-structure of the conversation, and your question: </p>

<p>He asked about the Palestinians, likening their suffering to the aforementioned Jews of the holocaust, and you ask about the Israelis . . .who are the culprits of palistinain genocide (your words), much like the nazis to the holocaust victims.</p>

<p>What?!?!?! haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The worst part of the plight of the Palestinians is how antisemites use their struggle in attempt to gain some sort of momentum for themselves. Also antisemites seem to think of anti zionist&#39;s as their peers. It&#39;s such a mess. Its all so convoluted and avoided on msm so it just seems to get worse and worse. The worst part though, is how little the average westerner knows on this topic, or how they blindly take the side of the zionists because of how horrible the holocaust was.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is very true.  As I&#39;m trying to explain to these guys, I am very much pro-Palestinian.  Their houses to razed every day, they are shot indiscriminately.  I shouldn&#39;t even have to write these words but just so you all know, I am not anti-Palestinian.  I just don&#39;t understand how they deny the Holocaust.

    <div class="md"><p>For me it wasn&#39;t the fact that they denied the holocaust, it&#39;s just that there are a lot of people on here that seem to be certain that it didn&#39;t happen. That bothered me for a bit, but then I realized the consensus on almost every conspiracy that is talked about on here is believed, and in many ways I prefer it that way. Having a large community of people that are always skeptical or deny what is portrayed on msm is actually good because it makes me think more critically. I&#39;m sure many other people on here are the same. Everything should be questioned, including the holocaust, to get a sharper understanding of the world we are living in. Unfortunately most people explore the theories to prove it didn&#39;t happen or they don&#39;t explore the theories because they are certain it did. Both of those attitudes are extremely dangerous in my opinion. The other thing is that Israel is fucking weird and their behaviour and mistreatment of Palestinians is just going to increase the number of holocaust deniers over the years. </p>

<p>From what i&#39;ve researched, the majority of deaths (and killings) started later half of the war when the Nazi lines were stretched.  This would explain those photos. </p>

<p>From research into survivors and from the photos available, it very mouch looks like things went real bad from 41/42 onwards.</p>

<p>This does coincidentally tie in with the Nazis stretching their lines.. I would imagine the two could be connected.</p>

<p>To trigger your cognitive dissonance, yes...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you think Jewish people were using the pools and theaters?</p>

<p>Sure, why wouldn&#39;t they? We have pictures of all of these things, even guards playing soccer with inmates...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Am I really going to nr forced to even write that maybe they were for the Nazis entertainment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering that there were far more people than guards, that logic does not make sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is the evidence of gas chambers? Jesus man. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, evidence please? Because what you said was not evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People survived by being strong enough to walk 20 miles a day with half a bowl of watery soup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you see that in a Holly Wood movie, and automatically assume that was true, or something? How did they escape <strong>death camps</strong> <em>with soup</em>? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those that didn&#39;t were gassed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, where is the evidence for &quot;gas chambers&quot;. We have evidence for delousing rooms, but not for the former...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t believe this you are believing a lie. </p>

<p>Mmm, <em>methinks you are the one believing in a lie.</em></p>

<p>It doesnt affect intelligent discourse to hold an opinion. Infact without opinion, intelligent discourse cannot happen.</p>

<p>You&#39;re bringing emotion into a debate on fact. I dont care if it was the best or worst of humanity, that is just immaterial BS that&#39;s best left to Op-eds.</p>

<p>Because the deaths attributed are incidental to the purpose they were built for. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to claim that I&#39;m minimising it again. But from my point of view, you&#39;re looking at it through a cloud of emotion.</p>

<p>like, should i assume you are &quot;bat shit crazy&quot; for believing men walked on the moon, or would it make more sense to assume you are simply gullible and/or stupid for believing that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;if we can&#39;t agree on fact&#39;</p>

<p>The whole point is to not universally agree in the facts as presented to us. If that sometimes leads to some bad ideas or theories, or silly conclusions such as a Flat Earth than that&#39;s okay. It&#39;s the cost of freedom of thought and speech and the upside of them two things is well worth accepting the downsides. You can&#39;t have one withiht the other. If you don&#39;t think something is appropriate or well thought out downvote and move on. If you&#39;re not willing to even read it or accept that it&#39;s okay and allowed, then just skip to moving on.</p>

<p>Putting people in jail for questioning the events surrounding the Holocaust is much, much more of a crime than question the events surrounding the Holocaust itself it. (this isn&#39;t just in the case of outright deniers and anti-semetics, also those who simply exercise a capacity to question official narratives.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You started by saying that in a post the other night, questions you consider valid about 9/11 were being raised about the Holocaust, which you seem to consider invalid. I think that is a wrong way to look at things in a conspiracy sub. </p>

<p>There is a lot of misinformation, disinformation, and outright lies put out by everybody involved in WW2. I can&#39;t think of a single group/country who hasn&#39;t misrepresented activities during the War to either hide their evil deeds, hide the fact that they looked the other way, hide the fact that they helped the &quot;bad guys&quot; to profit in some way, misrepresent their efforts to do the right thing, or misrepresent their losses for whatever reason. I think I understand your frustration that there are many books on the subject that corroborate the official stories. I personally find it impossible to refute the photographs of the dead/dying, and the personal statements given by people who were actively involved in the events. I will say that for me, personally, I cannot wrap my head around the numbers thrown out there for specific groups. I do know that the numbers for some groups were supposedly ratified/estimated by some of the Nazis themselves. I also know that prosecutors and tribunals will lie. I know that people on trial will often confess to anything if they think they might get a deal. Finally, I have seen how the 5 million or 6 million + numbers have been used by certain groups to benefit themselves even to this very day. This combination of stuff might makes some people question the official narrative.   </p>

<p>Perhaps some people think none of the atrocities happened at all. I haven&#39;t seen the post that you&#39;re referring to, but I have no reason to doubt that some of the 1/2 million people subscribed to this sub have the views that you described. I simply hate that anyone who questions the official number of the official story is declared an anti-semite, a bigot, or whatever else. </p>
