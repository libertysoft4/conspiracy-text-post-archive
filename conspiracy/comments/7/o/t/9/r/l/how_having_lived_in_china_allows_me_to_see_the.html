        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I lived in China for 9 years, moved back to the US in 2017. Here are some obervations:</p>

<p>In China if the govt. doesnt like a website they block it, making the web site inaccessible without a VPN. If they dont like a movie they dont approve it and it never makes it into production. If its a western film, they block it from theatres and major online platforms. Same for books, news, and bloggers. For people, at best you get blacklisted which means you cant get a job or do really anything, at worst you go to a work prison.</p>

<p>There is only one major news channel ,CCTV, but it has 10 or so channels with different things.</p>

<p>To maintain control of this massive censorship they have a massive army of ppl, the largest and most complex firewall in existance, and almost complete control of all instituions.</p>

<p>The govt. rewards people who become party members through access to career opportunities and advancements both within state-owned enterprises and for private companies. Private companies that do not kowtow to the govt. get extorted via targeted regulations, fines, and corporate sabotage. Most go bankrupt or eventually give in. Although in recent years it has not been as necessary to be a party member to ensure career advancement, it has def been necessary to have strong party afilliations. The govt. rewards people and companies who have shown to be aligned with the party interests, as demonstrated through their own investments into supported industries and official commitments in the media. Rewards are things like access to investment funds, invitations to lavish banquets, and favorable regulations.</p>

<p>The education system in China teaches rote memorization of whatever teachers want, including a lot of political brainwashing. Most ppl there think Tibet decided to rejoin China to help itself develop. Marxist ideology courses are mandatory for all universities in China for several years. People have all sorts of crazy understandings of history and the West.</p>

<p>While living and interacting with people on a daily basis, the general attitude was either completely brainwashed or they kind of knew that there was more to the story than they were being told, but believing anything else would be unpatriotic and they believed that that is bad. Or in many cases ppl like taxi drivers and blue collar workers just feel that talking about stuff like that is just not worth the trouble.It never ceased to amaze how strong some beliefs were about Taiwan being part of China or how Mao Zedong was a great man. Poking holes in some of the political narratives, I learned, was not an acceptable topic of discussion, nor was anything in opposition or different than party rhetoric. Of course when you have close friends that are open minded you can be more open, but its fairly rare.</p>

<p>I found it frustrating that people did not want to accept new ideas from individuals even when they made a lot of sense, preferring instead to do things through emulating past examples of something being done sucessfully. There was always a drive for people to take or copy what others had done instead of just thinking through it and doing it yourself. </p>

<p>Years of strict control in the education system and Chinese style companies makes ppl&#39;s critical thinking abilities weak or totally atrophied. In a company, when working with a colleague if you dont explain something exactly or show an exact example of what you want, he or she will never get it. </p>

<p>Now that Im back in the US...</p>

<p>Having spent years reading in between the lines to find truths in Chinese mouthpiece news sources, it makes it easier to see what is going on  with MSM in the US. At the same time, having experienced China (in many ways, China is the way the US will go if we dont do something about it) it is easier to see some of the methods of control and social programming going on in the US.</p>

<p>The US media has always had a problem with paying attention to the wrong thing with the argument that murders and gossip were what the people actually watched, saying international news and topics with more depth bored ppl. But now, its fuckin ridiculous how shamelessly all MSM channels are committed to one thing above all else, and that is being critical of Donald Trump. I hear their ratings have been better than ever through all this Trump reporting, but its pathetic how little else gets reported. This is either a massive concerted attack, which means their is a group behind it with an agenda, or they are 100% ratings whores. Personally, I think there have been too many examples of MSM shamelessly pushing an agenda to consider the latter option seriously, but it is a small possibility. </p>

<p>I have a lot to say about the level of depth and complexity in the psy ops and smokescreens being used by both Trump team and MSM, but Ill save it for the discussion if some one brings it up.</p>

<p>I have several of these, but heres and observation on a specific recent event:</p>

<ol>
<li>Charlottsville riot-Aug 2017
I wasnt paying this much attention initially as I was focused on North Korea &#39;war of words&#39; from Trumps Fire and Fury comment. Same comment Truman made threatening Japan btw. I saw Trumps brash words to Kim within the context of korean culture. Now, Korea is def not China but both countries are what I consider Face-based cultures. &#39;Face&#39; is very important in China and Korea, including North Korea. By making these comments to Kim which were very obviously and directly a challenge, Kim not accepting would undermining the authority of the &#39;supreme leader&#39; diminishing his power over his citizens resulting in a massive loss of face. Now if you think Chinese media is controlled, North Korea is a whole other level. North Koreans prob have no idea even what twitter is. However, enough media pointed at them and maybe the message will make it through to some extant. Undermining and challenging leadership would be a first step in destabilizing the society and waking ppl up.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyways, the outcome of the &#39;war of words&#39; is that Kim backed down in classic indirect way, but very significant in face-based cultures. Right when it could have come out in the media as a big victory for the administration, the Charlottsville riots happened. </p>

<p>Im sorry, but the timing of this staged riot was too much to be coincidence. Im open to counterevidence, but from what I know about rent-a-protesters or in this case rent-a-rioters, is that they are very real. Paid protesters are used extensively. This event just seemed to me like people were paid to protest as skinheads to distract from Trumps N Korea victory. Im sure there were real protesters too involved too maybe even the majority, but I would not be at all surprised to find out some of the organizers and more boisterous participants of the skinhead/neonazi riot were paid by the deep state. the key is who set the date for the riot and when did they set it?</p>

<p>Anybody has leads on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>got some other  &#39;comprehensive interpretations&#39; like the charlottsville riot example above for later posts if there is interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your observations. The way I see it, is that the US practices a lot of what China does, but we have to do so within our own context- meaning Corporations and Capitalists have a large say in the apparatus of State and in creating the Propaganda. That&#39;s why our News is still Corporate Propaganda but not as smooth as China&#39;s. Its why our Education doesn&#39;t teach critical thinking but also why we&#39;re trying to privatize it further with charter schools. It&#39;s why our government is dysfunctional and filled with Oligarchs. Tyranny mapped onto a different system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would not call the China method of information control smooth at all. Imagine driving home past a huge street riot that takes up a large portion of a crowded slum. Yet nowhere on the internet, radio, tv does anyone mention the riot or what caused it. You can see the smoke from your apartment building, but it goes completely ignored by the local and national media. Only to find a video a few weeks later from a satellite news channel you come across. That local party officials hired thugs accidentally shot a man who they tried to arrest and send to a mental hospital for writing anti-government propaganda. Over time it completely illegitimaties the news and government information even when that information is clearly true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the strength of the Chinese method comes from the &quot;Social buy in&quot; factor. The Chinese People seem to tolerate this madness as long as economic growth continues. Even though they are technically now a non-religious society, millennia of the concept of the &quot;mandate of heaven&quot; seems to have embodied itself in the Chinese consciousness. As long as the CCP manages to keep the economy moving and the wheels on, the People seem to be willing to support it, even with its stupid bullshit that you highlighted. The real test will come with a full on economic slow down/collapse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chinese history seems to imply that it would have to be a particularly disastrous scenario, and that a new option would have to emerge. The Chinese don&#39;t like chaos, and as you said, they&#39;ll still stick with it unless amidst that catastrophe another viable option presents itself as a possibility for taking control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>a lot of the Chinese economy is tied up in real estate. ppl have been talking bubble for years but it keeps going up. A lot of overall economic growth in recent years can be attributed to increase in real estate value versus increases in priduction or efficiency. If it does pop and the Chinese govt. isnt able to stop it, it could be quite disastrous. </p>

<p>although I would add, the many ppl who have financially benefited from China&#39;s rise are incredibly happy with the govt. These ppl generally live in the major cities.</p>

<p>You have to look at the muslim groups and people living in the rural areas to see the discontent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>US has its own style of this as well. Peaceful protests get zero coverage even when massive, or a tiny amount cast in the worst light in order to demoralize current members and hamper recruitment. If this doesn&#39;t work, agent provocateurs are utilized and then anyone who questions authority can be painted as immature, reckless, violent idiots until the next event. </p>

<p>My perspective is that the only significant difference between chinese and american methods of social control is that the american populace is far more effectively, subtly, and comprehensively brainwashed. </p>

<p>As William Casey, CIA Director 1981-1987, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Chinese know that they are being controlled, while Americans know that they are free.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had one class in high school that helped inspire critical thinking, the main focus throughout the course being cognitive dissonance. I graduated last year, and that was Junior year of high school. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad the teacher was able to work that sort of discussion into our (American History) class. Even though most of the students were drooling from boredom and simply didn&#39;t take the chance to connect the dots from past to present society, I definitely vibed well with the material and was thankful for his approach. I think classes like that need to be introduced to students at a younger age.</p>

<p>When we read 451, my teacher didn&#39;t use the opportunity to question today&#39;s society at all, which comes to me as a bit of a shock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I know with mid to higher level cadres in China there was a sort of rule that the party needed to have dirt on you they could use as blackmail before you could advance to that level. If they didnt already have dirt on you they would take you out to all sorts of brothels, maybe cut you in on some illegal deals that you profit from. The goal is to have a means of controlling you if they need it.</p>

<p>been looking at there being something similar in the US  and on a global level done by deep state, secret societies, or whoever. In the case of the US  the theory would be that they have been using satanic rituals and/or pedophilia as the blackmail piece. </p>

<p>Anthony Weiner, the known sexual deviant intentionally selected because he can be blackmailed. HRC brought Huma into the picture to either keep his sexual deviance under wraps or to further an agenda he was pushing on her behalf.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;everyone with half a brain or an IQ above room temperature knows that both segregation and Apartheid WERE the correct response to the presence of blacks in our countries. Blacks should never have been admitted, but once they were, they certainly didn&#39;t deserve citizenship just because of their presence.&quot;  You are correct in asserting this doesn&#39;t match my beliefs. I don&#39;t know how you can interpret this as <em>not racism.</em> there are also comments that lament Nazis being &quot;demonized,&quot; along with plenty of holocaust denial. I am not diminishing the fact that I found the author&#39;s viewpoint interesting, however it was clear from the comments that those reading it felt it helped support their racist/discrimnatory agendas.

<p>The US media has always had a problem with paying attention to the wrong thing with the argument that murders and gossip were what the people actually watched, saying international news and topics with more depth bored ppl. But now, its fuckin ridiculous how shamelessly all MSM channels are committed to one thing above all else, and that is being critical of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Pretty simple explanation here, GHWB lied about getting the CIA out of the media, they still have control over major outlets.</p>

<p>Im sorry, but the timing of this staged riot was too much to be coincidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do think that they&#39;re capable of faking a riot and an attack but I fail to see how they&#39;d gain anything from doing so. The vast majority of people don&#39;t know that Trump&#39;s &quot;fire and fury&quot; remark was a good thing, and most people wouldn&#39;t care either way. The Charlottesville riots, while distracting, didn&#39;t accomplish anything in that distraction. </p>

<p>The problem with the allegation of false flag attacks in the last few years is that we are entirely numb to them, we don&#39;t give a fuck about any of this until a friend or family member is hurt. So all this would be a waste of time and money on the part of TPTB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s crazy to think that even though the propaganda and sick insanity is so prevalent in the West, countries like China (not to mention North Korea)...etc. still have it even worse. My God, to think if even the majority of the West with all it&#39;s ability to look behind the curtains (relatively uncensored Internet...etc.) can&#39;t wake up, then how will the Chinese do it?</p>

<p>Imagine if the cabal decide to prop up China and their military and turn it into the next US? (this theory is based on the idea that there are a select ruling financial &quot;elite&quot; that prop up countries and use them totally for their own benefit, then allow them to collapse - like Rome, Germany during WW2....and now the US of course).</p>

<p>If this were to happen, with the even farther brainwashed populace, it would be very difficult to wake them up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still optimistic though, with our combined efforts we can still make the difference even now, as the US is the head of the world (militaristically speaking of course) and is likely the main hub from which the cabal&#39;s activities are coordinated.</p>

<p>Thanks for the post btw. Very insightful.</p>

<p>I think that they have already decided to do this. You could see the turning point when the UK joined the Chinese Development Bank. The City is the real financial center of the world, not wall st. They are betting on China for the future. Looking at Trump et al. it makes sense to me.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main thing I can think of is people are told that Tibet, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are historically Chinese and that supercedes any other claim of sovereignty or otherwise.</p>

<p>mostly you just get a very pro china anti captialist slant on everything as far as the official textbooks go and whatnot.</p>

<p>They do a lot of tricky stuff like for English class the lesson text will be a story that makes foreigners look bad, maybe be a propaganda piece.</p>

<p>The result is ppl often have really exaggerated impressions of some of the negative aspects of society they see on the media.</p>

<p>for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>ive been asked how many women I had raped</p></li>
<li><p>ppl have asked me several times if I carry a gun to work or school and if I used it to &#39;solve conflicts&#39; on a regular basis</p></li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, in general ppl treat westerners very well, much better even than they would their fellow chinese in many instances. A lot of people see americans as being very business-minded, although often very self interested. </p>

I&#39;m sure once they get to know you and who you are better they would more likely see that it&#39;s not what they have been reminded of. Great post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>China and the US are basically two sides of the same coin. Both are tightly controlled but in different, cuturally different ways that work best for those particular countries.</p>

<p>I agree living abroad for any amout of time gives you a better perspective of what is going on back home. I split my time between the US and Thailand and much of what was mentioned about China by the op is similar to what goes on in Thailand. Corruption is much easier to see in a simpler country. Most of the country is made up of poor farmers and they are mostly clueless about everything except farming just like it is planned.</p>

<ol>
<li>The thing about Trump&#39;s comments to Kim is that he was successful--but it was incidental. The guy acts and talks like he tweets on twitter, all the time 24/7. While he&#39;s made comments that have made Kim stand down, let&#39;s also remember he made comments that made him look like a child/idiot and NK has repeatedly called him out on it. Trump swings at every ball thrown at him--even imaginary ones. So yeah, the guy&#39;s going to hit something eventually.</li>

<ol>
<li>You say &quot;rent a protestor&quot; are real and have been used extensively...I&#39;d love to see this evidence you&#39;ve gathered if there&#39;s a lot of it as you claim. And then, that SKINHEAD protestors have been paid is an even grater claim because there are people that have been going to jail who were in that crowd and we&#39;d find out pretty fast if people were paid and were arrested. Unless you&#39;re claiming there&#39;s a corporate media conspiracy that has infiltrated and has systematically paid off our police and justice system...?</li>

Problem is, not is, is that very few people will search for it because of all the distractions we have, which, to be honest, I&#39;m guilty of too. There are exceptions to this rule though; There is still tons of incriminating information that our governments hold from us, and the MSM will censor or direct the public away from a conspiracy theory by dismissing it as a fraudulent story, in extreme situations. </p>

<p>Great post OP.</p>

<p>Most of &quot;us&quot; already suspected Charlottesville was an OP. I did not think NK had much to do with it and attributed most of it to Democrats using race to rile up their base. I went to the rally in Boston a week later with a keen eye for this but saw very little. Mostly undercover feds/cops everywhere, no neo nazi&#39;s whatsoever.</p>

<p>been thinking of the EPA as a similar organization that uses it funding for other things than protecting the environment. Come on, its the perfect &#39;hide it in plain sight&#39;. There was a little hubub when Trumps budget proposal was announced. Huge cuts to the EPA. I was looking for an exaggerated pushback response from environmentalists + shills, it met some resistance in the house panel, but didnt seem to have any momentum in MSM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you said about China is spot on. I don&#39;t think the Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville had anything to do with North Korea, however, you are probably right about fake Nazis i.e. Richard Spencer and a lot of the alt-right do seem to be deep-state (or SPLC) actors. But this is just intelligence gathering.</p>

<p>As for the media, yes Trump Derangement Syndrome infects most of the media. It is at pathological levels. However, the root of the problem (like most problems in the Western world) is a power vacuum i.e. when there is no sane alternative media to watch, the power vacuum gets filled by all sorts of freaks and lunatics and opportunists and careerists. The same could be said of the political system.</p>

<p>&quot;One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics, is that you end up being governed by your inferiors&quot; -- Plato.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Very nice of you to comment about your experience in China. Very interesting.</p>

<p>I agree with you about the co-ordinated paid infiltrators and agitators in Charlottesville. Sometime there is just TOO much to be real. I believe that there is a great deal of this going on in America right now. I think we should expect more.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of co-ordinated &quot;ANTIFA!&quot; going on to distract and an attempt to create a &quot;thing&quot; around it that did not fly then. All of a sudden &quot;ANTIFA&quot; disappeared. Expect this nonsense to be used again. They will need to marginalize progressive action. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whereas it can be argued that Mao did a lot of things that were ultimately very good for China such as banning foot binding for women, uniting the country under one language, and setting the foundation for the growth of china,</p>

<p>there is significant evidence showing that Mao took enjoyment out of personally murdering his enemies and believed very strongly that he derived power from having sex with virgins, which he did a lot of with underage girls while he was chairman. he gave a lot of them syphillis and other STDs he had. Can you imagine an underage girl being told she was very lucky to be meeting the &#39;supreme leader&#39;, and then walking away raped and with STD?</p>

<p>At the same time his decision to ban foot binding was bc he wanted more workers. He actively silenced anyone who opposed him, often time with violence, including ppl high within his own ranks. When zhou enlai got cancer Mao denied him treatment so he could more quickly eliminate  him as Zhou had become too popular. These are just a few examples.</p>

<p>Mao was very good at propaganda and manipulating his own ppl into believing bs. He destroyed massive amounts of ancient chinese cultural objects, and destroyed a lot of ancient traditions by banning them outright and punishing violators with brutal force. His &#39;great leap forward&#39; movement resulted in millions of preventable deaths of his ppl. Mao forced everyone to drop what they were doing so they could build military weapons for Mao&#39;s new army.</p>

<p>This meant farmers werent tending their crops. The resulting famine killed millions of Chinese ppl. This is where the original &#39;there&#39;s starving ppl in China so eat your vegetables&#39; expression came from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s a great point in the OP, namely about the Asian face-based cultures. From what I know, it&#39;s really true that Asians put a lot of weight on person&#39;s braggadocio and when Trump replied with &quot;I&#39;ve got a bigger button&quot;, this was the first time ever that a Western politician really defeated Kim Jong Un in the public arena, merely by using boastful words.</p>

<p>Trump actually knows how to get under the skin of Asians, probably because he dealt with them in business for decades. He&#39;s cunning like a fox and always follows his gut instinct (read Art of the Deal).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main thing I can think of is people are told that Tibet, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are historically Chinese and that supercedes any other claim of sovereignty or otherwise.</p>

<p>mostly you just get a very pro china anti captialist slant on everything as far as the official textbooks go and whatnot.</p>

<p>They do a lot of tricky stuff like for English class the lesson text will be a story that makes foreigners look bad, maybe be a propaganda piece.</p>

<p>The result is ppl often have really exaggerated impressions of some of the negative aspects of society they see on the media.</p>

<p>for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>ive been asked how many women I had raped</p></li>
<li><p>ppl have asked me several times if I carry a gun to work or school and if I used it to &#39;solve conflicts&#39; on a regular basis</p></li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, in general ppl treat westerners very well, much better even than they would their fellow chinese in many instances. A lot of people see americans as being very business-minded, although often very self interested. </p>
