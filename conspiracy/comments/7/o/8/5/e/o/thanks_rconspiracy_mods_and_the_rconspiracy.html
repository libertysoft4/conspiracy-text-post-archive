        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As I said in my title, I am not a natural &quot;conspiracy&quot; person. There are some conspiracies I believe in, others I don&#39;t. More often than not, I am looking for a non-sensational explanation.</p>

<p>I am somewhat left-centrist in my political views -- not in terms of the politicians in power, but in terms of where most Americans poll on issues like health care, taxes, drug legalization, immigration, social services, free speech, etc. -- and I realize that being left-centrist on this particular subreddit is a death knell for being respected. Well, so be it!</p>

<p>BUT, years ago I thought this subreddit was a joke. It was nonsense. However, similar to this <a href="https://youtu.be/ofXxinOtPiQ?t=1m25s">Norm MacDonald opening SNL monologue</a>, either I changed my mind, or the rest of reddit got REALLY bad.</p>

<p>Because right now, this subreddit is the only place I&#39;ve found that reliably allows me to discuss issues, present facts, and get upvoted when I do myself proud, and downvoted when I screw up. The voting tallies on this subreddit have something to do, unlike many other places, with the quality of my submissions and replies.</p>

<p>That is REALLY valuable.</p>

<p>A lot of that is due to the work of the mods. A lot of that is due, I will say, to people I can&#39;t <em>stand</em> who also post on this subreddit, who nevertheless call me out when I have holes in my arguments, or what I&#39;m trying to say. I hate it sometimes...but it works.</p>

<p>Thanks to the mods, thanks to the community here. </p>

<p>Keep it up, please.</p>

<p>Facts, sources, common sense, questioning...</p>

<p>I honestly think most of us are pretty close to you in that regard.  A lot of us grew up in the era of GWB and the Patriot Act, the Iraq War, the emerging surveillance state, the rise of for-profit prisons, the deregulated banks that blew up the economy.  All of those things are very &quot;right-wing&quot; in nature.  </p>

Those people are definitely the loudest here, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re the majority.

<p>I&#39;d argue everyone is a natural conspiracy person. People have been forming groups with like minded intent to strengthen their bidding for years. The only way you could believe there aren&#39;t any conspiracies going on in our world is if you believe there is no black market, and there is no crime. </p>

<p>I even watched a few flat earth videos that were posted here. Haha. </p>

<p>One of my favorite quotes ever: &quot;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment was reported and I&#39;ve approved it and ignored reports.</p>

<p>It&#39;s becoming increasingly clear that the report button is being abused and used instead of the downvote button.</p>

<p>At least it&#39;s a useful tool to see what comments trigger those who are drowning in the cognitive dissonance of the hive mentality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That guy is all over threads about Russian collusion, trump negativity and Hillary Clinton posts gatekeeping. Here he is again gate keeping. </p>

<p>So he ran on an anti-establishment platform to dupe these morons. Bernie ran anti-establishment, too. Why do you think they all chose to support trump? It’s not because he has a track record of helping people. He straight spoke to the racists,  nut jobs and “marginalized” whites. </p>

<p>Well, now what? </p>
