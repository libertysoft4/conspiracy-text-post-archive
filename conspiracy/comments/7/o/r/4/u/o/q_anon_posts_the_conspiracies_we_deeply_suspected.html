<p><strong>If GS is not paying for ANTIFA and the money comes from tax payers, WHO is directing these funds? If the funds are from slush funds, which dept because then we can narrow down to who give these orders</strong></p>

<p>Also, Q posted the <a href="http://prntscr.com/hx8ayx">7th floor</a> is no more. Sounds like Q is in total control of gov. Maybe even Deep State is dead. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the recent Q Anon post </p>

<p><a href="http://prntscr.com/hx86rq">http://prntscr.com/hx86rq</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>US taxpayers are paying for it all.</p>

<p>Paris accord = scam (trillions) </p>

<p>Red Cross = scam (billions)</p>

<p>Foreign Aid = scam (trillions)</p>

<p>WAR = scam (trillions)</p>

<p>………on…and….on……..</p>

<p>Who audits where the money actually goes?</p>

<p>Who actually receives the money?</p>

<p>The US taxpayer is funding the very people we are engaged in taking down.</p>

<p>Slush funds everywhere.</p>

<p>Think GS pays for Antifa out of his own pocket?</p>

<p>The hole is deep.</p>

<p>Feel sick yet?</p>

<p>Q</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a huge push against Q because it makes Trump look like a savior. Yet it encompasses almost every dark reality we have imagined here and ties it together in a nice bow. Q doesn&#39;t &quot;give answers&quot; because it&#39;s open in plain sight. Each question is relevant to the rest. There is way too much coincidences and predictions to simply dismiss this all at once without taking a second look. You&#39;d think the &quot;free thinkers&quot; on this sub would think a little harder. We are seeing either the biggest disclosure from a government to the people in the history of the world. I cannot see any possibility where this is some troll attempt or LARP. High level insiders do not waste days and hours to pull some elaborate prank on a very select group of individuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a litany of trump tweets and comments that directly call back to what Q said the night before. He also called Frankens resignation along with other CEO/congressional retirements/resignations. Bear in mind one of the first things Q said was &quot;disinformation is necessary&quot;. Why? Because if everything he said was true it would leak too much in the general mainstream. He wants the hive mind to be the ones in the know not normies. They cannot handle it. People like you are necessary to the cause. Regardless, like the other guy said predictions aren&#39;t the point. He&#39;s painting the picture we have been trying to paint since 9/11 and JFK. The geopolitical climate of our world right now becomes much clearer if you read the Q map from the beginning. </p>

<p>If you want to dismiss this then do it in solace. I don&#39;t comment on every flat earth thread because I don&#39;t believe it. Focus your energy on something worthwhile and productive because you&#39;re not going to dissuade anyone who believes in this stuff by making disparaging comments to the people that do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who ever this guy is, he&#39;s having a lot of fun. Thousands of people tuning in to a guy that never really even says anything. He asks questions about buzzwords in the conspiracy community. He&#39;s made plenty of hints and predictions about democrats getting in trouble or going to jail and so far none of it has come true. But people still read every word and hope it means something. If he was actually an insider, he could easily prove it by actually telling you things. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the point in leaving hints so people can just say &quot;ooooooo cool that could be this other thing.&quot; What is the point of Q?  Nobody has ever guessed something would happen based on anything he&#39;s said. Its just a fun little game to play and connect the dots you want after things have already happened. </p>

<p>If you want to use his game to Google some stuff you don&#39;t know much about then go for it. But there is no method to the madness. It&#39;s just a game. </p>
