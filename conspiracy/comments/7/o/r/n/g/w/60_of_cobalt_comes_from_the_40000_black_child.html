        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To match the power generated by fossil fuels or nuclear power stations, the construction of solar energy farms and wind turbines will require:</p>

<ul>
<li>15 times more concrete</li>
<li>90 times more aluminum </li>
<li>50 times more iron</li>
<li>50 times more copper </li>
<li>50 times more glass. </li>
</ul>

<p>Wind and solar energy only provide 2% of total global demand.</p>

<p>Solar energy uses much more aluminum than fossil energy. It uses as much as 1 gram/ kilowatt hour. Iron, nickel, aluminum and copper are the top fossil energy emitters. Wind power requires 10 times as much nickel as we use now if we want 100% renewable electricity. But, don&#39;t forget, 100% renewable electricity only makes up 20% of the world&#39;s total energy demand. Which means we would need something like 50 times more nickel again, if we converted 100% of total world energy demand to renewables. Check for yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/renewable-energys-hidden-costs/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/renewable-energys-hidden-costs/</a></p>

<p>But since wind and solar are intermittent, we would need 10 their rated power output to close one equivalent. It takes 10 Gigawatts of solar and wind power to close one gigawatt of natural gas.</p>

<p>To help offset this, we need billions of tons of batteries. </p>

<p>These batteries require tons of graphite, cobalt, nickel and lithium. </p>

<p>Graphite mining is so dirty, it&#39;s only done in China. In 2008, they shut down several graphite mines to lower air pollution just for the Oplympics. Graphite dust is a fine silvery sparkling dust that covers everything. It gets in the water, covers the leaves and crops. The reason it&#39;s done in China is because human life is cheap there.</p>

<p>Cobalt is the other weak link in our green hyperdrive fantasies.</p>

<h2><strong>60% of cobalt comes from the 40,000 black child slaves in the Congo!</strong></h2>

<p><strong>THE COBALT PIPELINE</strong></p>

<h2>This is why we need electric cars</h2>

<p>Graphite can be made, but costs tons more. Cobalt can also be mined as a byproduct of copper and nickel mining. Rare Earth Elements, what I call erotic minerals, are not mined alone but are also the byproduct of other base metal mining operations. The byproduct output is a small fraction of the base metal output. In other words, you need to move a lot of base metals to get very little erotic minerals. And what better place to sell heavy metals than in electric cars? You cannot mine erotic minerals unless you can sell all the base metals that go with it. You have to sell more steel, aluminum and nickel to get the exotic minerals a hi-tech world demands. </p>

<p>People try to sell you Green Growth. The idea that we can grow into a globalized green economy of economic justice. They try to make you think all the slaves in China are going to sit on their asses collecting a Universal Basic Income while a new army of robots mine minerals and make cars. This model is so stupefyingly idiotic, it is only sold in liberal arts and climate science classes where students think life is a set of menu choices you either like or mute.</p>

<p>There are also safe nuclear reactor designs (liquid salt reactors / thorium) that we should develop into working power plants.</p>

<p>We should stop shutting down working reactors prematurely out if political pandering (German atomic exit), while reevaluating the safety of all reactors independently, shutting older stations down if necessary. And safer, cleaner methods of nuclear fission should be incentivised, rather than shunned.</p>

<p>Thorium promises to be safer, cleaner, cheaper and more abundant than any known energy source. Ever wonder why we haven&#39;t developed it after first being proposed a century ago? I do.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a disingenuous question. Acute fatalities from radiation exposure are really easy to count--what&#39;s much harder, or impossible to calculate, is how many life-years are lost.
