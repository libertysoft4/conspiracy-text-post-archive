        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Internet is beautiful, sometimes is a silly drama (a cospiracy?)</strong></p>

<p>So, internet is beutifil becuase you can meet new cultures. Nekochan is one of this subculture of old 90s UNIX. Their website is a small island in the cyberspace dedicated to retro hw/sw like old SGi machines. There is a ond fashion forum there, and a bazaar marketplace where you can buy and fill a request for a wanted gear.</p>

<p>A good interesting place, I believed, but I was wrong. It&#39;s more interesting HOW they can be obnoxious in distorting facts! </p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Registered on Nekochan as Ivelegacy; posted for a while, tried to write interesting things, got insults, tried to sell workstations and parts, got banned with the <strong>formal accusation of being dishonest</strong>! Without explaining what was wrong, and without giving the possibility to clarify. </li>
<li>It was not acceptable, so I sent some emails to forum members to discuss the reason for the given ban, because it was an <strong>IP-ban</strong></li>
<li>And I got answered by someone that Dexter1 was the reason, and he should have been removed from the mods. Got tons of these emails by those have no attributes to repeat the concept in public</li>
<li>Sent an email again to a member to intercede to mod to remove the IP-ban (mods said &quot;fsck you&quot;). IP-ban means you can access the forum not even in read-mode because everything is obfuscated, that means you can&#39;t follow links when you came across them by googling</li>
<li>I abbandoned my projects, but I didn&#39;t stop to sell machines on ebay (it was my second core business, done for living ... litteraly to pay the rent)</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>More than one year later came back with a new nick, Y66999<br/></li>
<li>when they figured it was me, I got a lot of new insults under the same concept  <em>&quot;you are still dishonest in the same way you were dishonest&quot;</em>. I assume due to my eBay activity.</li>
<li>I was giving some criticism on &quot;O2 used for space missions&quot;, because I happen to have a degree in Electronic Engineering, but instead of listing to my points I got accused of spamming, trolling, and got banned again</li>
<li>so, started writing articles on Reddit to tell people what happens on Nekochan, because it was not acceptable, and because the Admin has never replied to my request for clarification</li>
<li>Did mistakes, of course, like contacting four forum members via email again, this time to clarify the reason why they had written things on the forum. Got new insults, especially from RaionFox, who is very aggressive and arrogant.</li>
<li>Registered on irix.pw with the nick name Ivelegacy, because RaionFox wrote that it would be a fresh new start. New big mistake, because he han never stopped himself from insulting on Nekochan, and, even if he wrote that I would have allowed me to clarify some points, but, when I started writing, he deleted my posts dragging my name, surname, and email in public without authorization</li>
<li>asked to remove it, and got a ban by RaionFox.</li>
<li>start posting links to Reddit&#39;s articles on Dodoid&#39;s YouTube channel, just to redirect people to Reddit, a place where I can reply because I am banned from Nekochan and RaionFox&#39;s site</li>
<li>got new insults got called &quot;retard&quot;, etc etc, a lot of embarathing insults with no chance to have a civial dialog or discussion, they find it &quot;funny&quot;. So it&#39;s really &quot;funny&quot; to give insults to someone who can&#39;t reply. What a shit!</li>
<li>opened my own forum &quot;Wanderland&quot;, without mentioning Nekochan, because my purpose is selling/buying/trading stuff for IRIX without the silly presence of mods like Dexter1</li>
<li>and <strong>I have been experimenting tons and tons of cyber-attacks against my website, with fake-users who are only made to post offensive material and drag porno-videos as post&#39;s attachment with the porpose of putting MYSQL into crash</strong> (I am going to inform the authorities for that. Everything is logged)</li>
</ul>

<p>And now, someone there is claiming that that THEY have a thread &quot;discussing things&quot;. </p>

<p>Discussing WHAT? To discuss should imply my presence there and a civil way of clarification, instead of putting insults and bullshit in order to drag a person down their silly cliche&#39;! Look at facts, there is no single attempt, no single post, no intention, to have a critical analysis, and IP-ban means that! &quot;We don&#39;t want to discuss anything, you just must go fsck you up&quot;. They are bigger, smarter, and that is a way to harras someone who is less talkative in English!</p>

<p>In fact, what has been written starting from the first page of their topic against me? Tons of insults! Pointing out that my English is &quot;shitty&quot;.</p>

<p>And who did gave me the accuse of being dishonest for giving the same workstation on both ebay and their bazaar? And when/where did it was discussed? No dice, never it happened, and never it will! Take insults and shut the plug up.</p>

<p>There is also a lot of xenophobic attitude against foreigners (i.e. <strong>try to constantly degrade to &quot;retards&quot;  for grammatical errors</strong>). Nekochan should be quoted in a court case for the violation of human being&#39;s values. Kidding. But, can you really accept a place when they-they-upper-class feel allowed to insult in this way?</p>

<p>What a shit! I am disgusted! I lost faith in that kind of people. </p>

<p>Also, what is that? A cospiracy against my little website? There are currently only three active users in my forum, and resources are limited, do they really need to put the server down? Yestarday MYSQL got corrupted again, and we lost a few posts and attachments.</p>

<p>I am angry, anyway. Because I have to fix the database of my website, cleaning it out the garbage. Again! I am angry because it&#39;s a silly way to use the personal free time. And I am going to fly to norway soon to run a new job. If they don&#39;t stop, I won&#39;t have free time to fix the MYSQL database of Wonderland, and I will simply be put offline =(</p>

<p>Yes, this silly sentence gives me a flashback to a sentence written in Nekochan, so you are probably a member of that website. Who? RaionFox&#39;s sockpuppet, I suppose. Maybe I am wrong, anyway, and unfortunately, here you can&#39;t hide your ass behind a clicky group of suckup users.</p>

<p>Look at the status of my website: do you see? Corrupted again by an idiot who needs to put his shit into my website, and I have to lock the whole server to find the vulnerability. SHT I can&#39;t spend so much time for babysitting people like your mates!</p>

<p>So, tell your mates that you are really a group of disgusting person, only able to offend at a different level of increasing annoyance, and, considering that you are all grown men, that is a shitty shame!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a Nekochan user. I&#39;m simply pointing out how your obsessively stalkerish behavior of what is likely just a group of old men and a few young guys who are virgin nerds indicates that you are just as much a part of the issue that you seem to be against.</p>

<p>There are other vintage boards you cab go on. Vcfed.org, amibay.com etc. Are other boards that allow sales of software since that seems to be a major sticking point with you and this site. As for RaionFox, I don&#39;t know the guy, but I would have to ask for his side before he judges. </p>

<p>Either way, this is definitely you being paranoid and taking the actions of a few trolls so seriously you want to call the police? Most of these trolls probably live in another country (you seem to speak Spanish or Italian, I can&#39;t tell, so I&#39;m gonna guess you&#39;re in Europe) and most of your enemies are in America. How do you propose to prosecute them?</p>

<p>Seriously, what is the alternative? Should I put my server offline? Because of their attacks? Do you know they tried to doxx (= extract emails) my users by attacking the userprofile-module? This because on PHPBB this module has some vulnerabilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vcfed.org is not Amiga focused. It has a subsection for your interests. Basically go for larger, more international focused places for your discussion. Vcfed.org is good.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t recommend reusing any usernames that someone may know. I.e they know ivelegacy for sure.</p>

<p>You&#39;re understandable in English, but I can see where you would have some issues interacting with a mostly American audience. The US is quite homogeneous when it comes to English speakers, the number of Hispanics (like myself) is tiny compared to overall. So it&#39;s common for Americans to be not aware of how to deal with misunderstandings in language barrier, as opposed to Europe where lots of tiny countries are side by side with many different languages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ah, okk. This makes sense for me. In fact, I was asked if I preferred a job in California (hot and sunny) or a job in Norway (cold and snowy). I am a beach-boy, I really like the sea, and the company that is employing me is a multinational corporation with a lot of offices around the world. Unfortunately, the office in Australia was already assigned. Anyway, even if I need to learn the Norwegian language to operate there, I instinctively sent my preference to the office in Norway. They speak English, but in the contract, it&#39;s written that I need that they prefer dialogs in Norwegian. Of course a minimum of survival Norwegian for the first three years, anyway, so you have a soft curve for learning.</p>

<p>I was surprised of my choice, taken instinctively, therefore surprising since I have always admired the USA: big streets, big towers, big cars, also I have always watched the Baywatch series, as well as other television products made in the USA. And I flew there a couple of times, but it was for vacation. </p>

<p>So, I am a European-man, I&#39;d best stay in Europe =P</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>When someone made it just a notch worse on eBay</h2>

<p>I think a bit of clarity is in order. Not playing the blame game, but googling around for forum-alternatives, I still cannot see any mention in their Bazaar-area&#39;s rules that states that you’re not allowed to try and sell elsewhere as well. I can imagine many people listing on eBay, and also giving a heads-up on forum&#39;s bazaar too. The rules on some forum (including Nekochan) do clearly state no software sales, and I fully appreciate why that is the case (because it’s legally a very dodgy area seeing as a lot of EULA’s don’t permit the re-sale of licensed software – despite a lot of IRIX software being fairly abandoned these days). However, I don’t personally see why offering it on eBay with software would be a Nekochan violation. If eBay want to police that, I’d say it’s up to them – so long as the Nekochan sale does not include licensed software. Anyway, the crazy part is that nobody cared about WTF happened, not even if … it caused an extremely unpleasant situation with eBay, because <strong>someone ( I don’t know who ) wanted to be “so kind” to inform them about a “probably suspicious software” included with one of my auctions … and Ebay, suspecting it was something of illegal, reacted suspending my account for verification!</strong> It happened more than year ago, but it happened, and of course there was absolutely nothing wrong with my auction, the machine with the harddrive was picked up by me from a design studio, cleaned from the dust, checked by diagnostics, ram-maximized, refurbished and offered for sale! I was able to prove it and the problem was sorted out in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>But it caused two weeks of stop, and ~100 euro wasted in the production of the document to prove it was not illegal software! My acknowledgments to those &quot;nice nice nice guys!&quot; (sarc)</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>Probably the cause</h2>

<p>Probabily means that it&#39;s my opinion formed on the basis of incomplete information.</p>

<p>The admins don’t care, so there’s no higher authority among that 
tiny community, and nobody replied. May be it was a “blanket ban” by those guys with Bad-Cops-badges to ensure they can’t be touched by any US issues, and the crazy part is, even in the US, licensing on SGIs was never tied to the physical media! Those guys with badges are paranoid Bad-Cops, very paranoid for ancient software, and people in the forum won’t help (especially in public) because they’re too scared of getting jerked around by admins who are overly paranoid about someone coming after them for ancient software. They aren’t also usually prone to listen (especially if you are a foreign) as well as they aren’t usually prone to give explanations, not even if you are a new entry.</p>

<p>Nobody had never told me that the admin has gotten “Cease and Desist” orders from law firms representing various hardware and software manufacturers. Details completely unknown when facts happened along a shallow communication between mods and users.</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>Last, not the least, the recent embarrassing episode </h2>

<p>Again my conjecture (yes, I am becoming paranoid), but ..during my presence in Nekochan I happened to offer a couple of PowerPC boards in bazaar. They were Arm System On Module soldered on backplane, I designed and made a few boards, offered for the purchase in Nekochan&#39;s bazaar. Someone noticed them and I was contacted by a couple of companies, interested in collaboration, and of course, I was interested in collaborating.</p>

<p>Due to my “special arrangement” with some special customers (whose software heavily involves Autodesk’s products, i.e. EagleCAD is now Autodesk&#39;s as well as Autocad), I then got a phone call by some men in black with Autodesk-badges, who wanted to verify a few things about the software I was using for the collaboration. </p>

<p>formally I was a freelancer, paid on demand for projects collaboration.</p>

<p>On Nekochan there is a “your last purchase” topic where I wrote that I had bought a second-hand laptop where I found EagleCAD installed on the harddrive with a professional license, of course, registered to the name of the laptop’s owner, and there must be some relation with the recent embarrassing experience triggered on what I had claimed to use to support my business.</p>

<p>We all had a long talk, during the inspection, about – “hidden costs of using unlicensed software” – because, as you (‘d best) know – ” using pirated software, even unknowingly, can cause system failure, endanger your personal data, and negatively affect your business productivity” – So kind, guys! Their software is the fourth most pirated software in the world, according to a study by the Software &amp; Information Industry Association. Including my copies of EagleCAD.</p>

<p>The academic personal edition they found installed on my laptop comes from my University, the license is registered in my name, while the professional edition comes from the purchase of a secondhand laptop, and the license is not registered in my name. And that was what the wanted to verify: original, or pirated? Where does the laptop come from? Let&#39;s contact the original owner!</p>

<p>No problem. But the attitude is irritating embarrassing!  They justify telling that - <em>&quot;one of the most frequently pirated software from CadSOFT (now it’s Autodesk) obtained through torrents or cracks&quot;</em> -. </p>

<p>Oh, About that there was also a funny misunderstanding that needs to be clarified: on the forum I had written that – <em>” the autorouter program was modified to suit my needs “</em> – and someone must have thought that it was a &quot;sneaky attempt to fool the license&quot; while all of my researching activities (where I need to modify the autorouter) are done on gEDA, an opensource application installed on my HP-RISC/linux workstation. Thus, what got modified to suit my needs is a couple of source files covered by an opensource license. </p>

<p>Nothing wrong with it!</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>Some remark of vulnerabilities (Italian)</h2>

<p>Written by a friend. It contains some links to articles that tell about insecurities. Good lecutures.</p>

<p>PHP e&#39; una [schifezza](url=<a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/</a>) quando si cerca di fare qualcosa di minimamente sicuro; aggiunto a MySQL che a mio avviso è uno dei peggiori RDBMS*, rendere sicuro un sito PHP+MySQL è un&#39;impresa titanica. A questo si aggiunge il fatto che phpBB non è proprio il campione di sicurezza.</p>

<p>E&#39; quindi facile introdurre per sbaglio delle vulnerabilità anche gravi: basta dimenticarsi di fare un escape su un parametro di una query e bam hai aperto la porta al mondo.</p>

<p>Ricordo che la prima versione di commodorefangazette.com era fatta in PHP, e cercando di seguire tutte le best practices e controllando i parametri uno a uno veniva fuori uno schifo di codice che non finiva più. Quando abbiamo rifatto un sito simile in Python(web.py) + PostgreSQL, avremo praticamente scritto 1/3 del codice, in quanto psycopg2 (la libreria per connettersi a Postgre) già di suo convertiva i parametri alla query evitando possibili injection, e il motore di template faceva escape dell&#39;HTML così era impossibile, di default, avere delle vulnerabilità XSS.</p>

<p>Se devi ripartire da capo, ti consiglio di lasciar perdere phpBB e passare a qualche altra soluzione; se vuoi rimanere su PHP+MySQL c&#39;è Simple Machines Forum, altrimenti in passato ho provato <a href="https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB">nodeBB</a>, che come indica il nome gira sopra node.js, altrimenti ci sono <a href="https://flaskbb.org">FlaskBB</a> e <a href="https://github.com/rafalp/Misago">Misago</a> che sono in Python.</p>

<p>Installalo su un VPS fornito da un provider attendibile e che ha una protezione contro i DoS (come Digitalocean o Linode), fai un filo di hardening, ovvero rimuovi TUTTI i servizi eccetto HTTP/HTTPS, e cambia la porta SSH a qualche altro valore non standard (o togli SSH del tutto e usa la console del provider per fare manutenzione, o fai uno script che ti avvia SSH e dopo tot tempo te lo disattiva nuovamente).</p>

<p>Potendo inserire codice javascript arbitrario in un post, hai inserito una vulnerabilità che si chiama <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</a>.
Se dovessi fare io un exploit, sarei partito dal provare a catturare il tuo cookie di sessione, iniettando un codice JS che legge il cookie locale e in qualche modo me lo trasmette ad esempio facendo una chiamata a un qualche endpoint HTTP su un server di mio possesso. In questo modo, quando tu (amministratore) visiti la pagina con il codice iniettato, il tuo cookie di sessione viene inviato a me e lo posso usare per &quot;loggarmi&quot; con il tuo utente (in realtà non passi per il codice di login perchè phpBB riceve già il cookie valido e ti lascia passare). A questo punto sono dentro come amministratore (di phpBB) e provo a vedere se c&#39;è qualcosa che posso usare per rompere ulteriormente, o sfruttare una vulnerabilità di qualche funzione di amministrazione per inviare comandi alla shell di Linux.</p>

<p>Se non riesco a prenderti il cookie (perchè magari è impostato Http Only), posso sempre farti eseguire codice mio però nel tuo contesto, quindi posso eseguire qualsiasi call GET/POST in un contesto da amministratore; l&#39;unica scomodità è che devo pensare alla sequenza di azioni in anticipo per codificarle tutte nel codice che vado ad iniettare, ma posso sempre usare questa tecnica per crearmi un mio utente amministratore che poi posso usare come descritto sopra.</p>

<p>Questa tecnica è circa un <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">Cross-Site Request Forgery</a>, con la differenza che grazie al XSS posso fare le chiamate direttamente dal tuo sito, bypassando limitazioni date dalla same-origin policy (tutte tecniche che comunque credo phpBB non abbia).</p>

<p>So, the db is gone damaged with no chance to be repaired, and I haven&#39;t yet understood what caused the corruption; a friend has recently pointed out some links to articles that tell about insecurities: good lectures that I want to share to those want to open a forum!!!</p>

<ul>
<li>PHP is a <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">bad design</a></li>
<li>MySQL is not a good RDBMS*</li>
<li>PHP+MySQL is hard to be hardened </li>
<li>Python(web.py) + PostgreSQL is better</li>
<li>PHP+MySQL atlerantives: { <a href="https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB">nodeBB</a>, <a href="https://flaskbb.org">FlaskBB</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rafalp/Misago">Misago</a> }</li>
<li>Javascript open vulnerabilities if your website allows HTML code injection (1)</li>

<p>(1) Wonderland was written in PHP+MYSQL, and &quot;HTML code injection&quot; was implemented and Javascript allowed: a triplet of bad ideas that I wouldn&#39;t suggest you to repeat.</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>The Psychology of Insults</h2>

<p>The desire to put others down may be as old as...chickens.
Posted Nov 21, 2016, by Nigel Barber Ph.D. Nigel Barber Ph.D.</p>

<p>Motivated by Anger?</p>

<p>Chickens are famous for having a pecking order, in which the bottom chicken in the hierarchy is pecked by everyone else and the top chicken is not picked on by anyone. The chicken hierarchy is settled by physical aggression.</p>

<p>In a verbal society, such as the human one, physical aggression is less often used to settle issues of status: These are mostly deferred to verbal interactions. An insult can thus be interpreted as an attempt to reduce the social status of the recipient and raise the relative status of the insulter.</p>

<p>If that logic is correct, we can assume that insults are often motivated by anger surrounding issues of status insecurity. Many insults are reactive: They are responses to real or imagined slights from others, such as a person accidentally cutting in front of someone else in a line.</p>

<p>We live in a period of extreme concern about how we are perceived by others; social psychologists are charting a steady increase in narcissism among college students.1 There is little consensus about why this is happening, but some scholars believe that the more children are measured on evaluative scales—aptitude tests, IQ scores, and GPA—the more sensitive they are to threats to their social rank.</p>

<p>Of course, this narcissism trend is only accentuated by social media, where participants are subject to unrelenting evaluation by other network members who encourage participants to inflate their egos, often at the expense of others.1 Concern with how one is perceived creates social insecurity that may be relieved by lashing out at other chickens (or people) in the area. Social networks are replete with individuals who deliver stinging rebukes because they enjoy doing so, and because they are mostly exempt from the reprisals that one might expect for real-world put-downs.</p>

<p>Content: Status, Competence, Sex, and Hygiene</p>

<p>The purpose of a put down is to reduce someone else in the imaginary status hierarchy. So it is hardly surprising that insults will often refer to a person&#39;s social status in terms of ancestry, lack of prestige, or membership in a despised out group; for example, Nazis or vagrants. Otherwise, the content of insults across the ages is monotonously predictable: Many insults feature a sexual component, refer to sexual organs, or bring up shameful or ineffectual sexual behavior. In addition to status and sexuality, insults inflict shame by mentioning unappealing traits—fatness, shortness, baldness, spottiness, and contagious diseases.</p>

<p>Another way of taking a person down is by questioning their intelligence or general mental competence; for insult purposes, recipients are invariably &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;crazy.&quot;</p>

<p>The pecking-order logic of insults means that if the recipient is shamed, then the insulter rises in status relative to the victim: The insulter is the one doing the pecking rather than getting pecked. Not all insults are equal, of course: Some pecks miss their mark and have no impact upon relative status.</p>

<p>Aim: An Arrow Shot Over the House That Hits No One</p>

<p>We live at a time when insults are dispensed so freely that they threaten the financial viability of social media platforms like Twitter. Indeed, Twitter recently issued a code of conduct for users designed to exclude the worst offenders; other sites like Facebook have quickly followed suit.</p>

<p>For those who enjoy distributing insults, the internet is a perfect environment, one that can offer a shield of anonymity and an absence of consequences. The larger question is whether the frequency of ill-motivated personal attacks will ride the wave of increasing narcissism or succumb to social controls?</p>

<p>Is There a Future in Insults?</p>

<p>Effective communities maintain solidarity by keeping direct insults to a minimum. Hence the elaborate traditions of politeness and respect found in real-world communities of the past; people behaved that way to avoid unnecessary anger, disputes, and violence.</p>

<p>Online communities are becoming more concerned about the destructive consequences of tolerating the flamers, trolls, and vandals in their midst and are instituting mechanisms for group punishment in which those who violate codes of decency are identified and excluded.</p>

<p>Such mechanisms are already ingrained in applications such as Uber and Airbnb. Soon social media will also be regulated—and it&#39;s about time. The only problem is that users may ultimately receive an online civility score that will boost collective narcissism—and make us want to peck our neighbors even more.</p>

<p>The chickens are restless!</p>

<p>You&#39;re understandable in English, but I can see where you would have some issues interacting with a mostly American audience. The US is quite homogeneous when it comes to English speakers, the number of Hispanics (like myself) is tiny compared to overall. So it&#39;s common for Americans to be not aware of how to deal with misunderstandings in language barrier, as opposed to Europe where lots of tiny countries are side by side with many different languages.</p>
