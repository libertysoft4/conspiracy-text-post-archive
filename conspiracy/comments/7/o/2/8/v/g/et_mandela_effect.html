        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Recently my mum read an article on why M&amp;M’s decided to drop the opportunity to be in the film E.T and she started to call absolute bullshit on it. The scene M&amp;M’s would’ve been featured in is at the beginning of the movie, where Elliot tries to entice E.T out of his hiding spot, using what is now clearly a bag of Reese’s Pieces. My mum says that she absolutely clearly remembers it being M&amp;M’s (not Reese’s Pieces) since M&amp;M’s weren’t a thing you could buy in England until the success of the movie, when everyone wanted to suddenly buy these sweets. She absolutely did not believe in conspiracy theories before this either, which is why I’m inclined to think she may have something here. Another thing about this is that Reese’s as a brand only came to England VERY recently which I find strange for such strongly received product placement from one of the most successful movies of the 80’s.</p>

You think originally M&amp;M’s were in the movie, but then they later changed it to Reeses or something?

<p>I would not call this the Mandela Effect, because that would require numerous people who share the same false memory. I have never heard this mentioned before. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting!! That makes a lot of sense! The thing that got me very confused about this was the fact M&amp;M’s were non existent before that movie, so this does clear that up. Like I’ve said before, this was nothing to do with me and everything to do with my mum, so it’ll be interesting to hear what she says about this! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;the fact M&amp;M’s were non existent before that movie&quot; -wut?</p>

<p>ET released: 1982</p>

<p>M&amp;Ms originated: 1941</p>

<p>What is more believable:</p>

<p>Timelines are fracturing and intertwining, and this is causing a chaotic shift in the way information in pop culture is represented on the holofracal cave wall...</p>

<p>Or, We the People suck at remembering things, and it gets worse with age.</p>

<p>Hug Your mom and just agree with her. Soon You will forget that Han Solo shot Captain Kirk first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well what I actually said was they weren’t a thing you could buy in England. As I can clearly tell you’re not from England, I’ll continue to look for what my ‘mum’ was questioning about else where. Thank you for your comment, a foreign insight is always interesting! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I quoted you word for word.</p>

<p>You ever play a game called broken telephone? one kid wispers to another a &quot;word&quot; and by the end of the chain, the word is borked. (wrong)</p>

<p>Your moms broken telephone is between her ears. She saw the product placement on the show and something broken in her head says the powers that be have changed it out for another.</p>

<p>Free tip. Stay clear of people who believe in Mandella effect or Flat Earth. True sign of mental illness.</p>

<p>You know the kicker? Nelson Mandela? guy this illness is named after....</p>

<p>anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist...</p>

<p>Everyone forgets the Racist, Terroristic, Murderous beginnings. Its all puppies and flowers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what you said, but the Mandela Effect actually is a real thing. It is just a term for when a lot of different people share the same false memory. It was named the Mandela Effect because a lot of people used to think Nelson Mandela was dead like 10 years before he actually was. </p>
