<p>Apologies if this is a re-post.</p>

<p>Thoughts on this youtube video from David Icke?</p>

<p>For me its very thought provoking if a little far fetched at times. Also the first time I&#39;ve seen any conspiracy documentary taking a pop at Bill Gates.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>David Icke has woken up more people worldwide than anyone in history. I am currently re reading all of his books. It amazes me how moronic people make their petty statements and know nothing about the incredible work done by David Icke. He has very bad arthritis, yet does 10 hour lectures on a regular basis, because he ACTUALLY CARES. </p>

<p>Anyone that actually spends one hour actually reading one of his books will significantly expand their knowledge base. Calling David a &quot;cunt&quot; or a &quot;schizophrenic&quot; helps no one. It also shows the person putting forth pathetic insults is actually extremely stupid.</p>

<p>David Icke was getting literally spit on by the public decades ago for saying Jimmy Savile was a savage molester and necrophiliac. </p>

<p>David Icke was sworn at and threatened by the public decades ago for exposing the Satanism and Pedophilia of the Global Elite. </p>

<p>David Icke has done significantly more than anyone in the world to wake up humanity. He continues to do so. </p>

<p>I have done non stop research for decades. Much more than most people on this entire planet. I have read all his books numerous times. I have watched his ten hour lectures and other videos numerous times. Anyone else who has put in substantial effort to examine the incredible research of David Icke would agree with me that:</p>

<p>David Icke is a GREAT HUMAN BEING and a true HERO OF FREEDOM...</p>

The easiest way to explain this is get a low priced used copy of &quot;Tales From The Time Loop&quot;. David Icke goes into massive detail on this covering hundreds of pages of detailed information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As absurd as it sounds to your average bloke Icke&#39;s explanation is really the only one that makes sense..... I mean look at everything that&#39;s going in the world today. Humanity is definitely being manipulated and controlled by an outside force that&#39;s not even human and most people are too dumbed down to even think about or look into it. Even it they did their conditioning and cognitive dissonance would have them reject and ridicule these ideas just like they we&#39;re socially engineered to do it&#39;s astonishing. We should always be challenging our own beliefs, most of them were given carefully sanctioned by governing bodies that can not be trusted in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your hypothetical there are two options: Kill 3/4 of the planet, or do nothing and let the human race go extinct.</p>

<p>In reality, you will never be tasked with such a ridiculous moral dilemma. First, you can&#39;t know the future with much accuracy, and secondly, you always have many competing, viable choices. With all that said, does it really matter if humanity becomes extinct in 50 years? The universe itself has an expiration date, no? Mankind will eventually become extinct anyway, and if it doesn&#39;t, that is perhaps scarier. There is no inherent value in survival, we simply attribute this value because it is a biological imperative. Truth be told, I don&#39;t think either choice presents itself with more ethical value than the other, so the answer would be relative to the person being asked. If I were 60+ years old, and humanity had 50 years left, I&#39;d say let it burn. I wouldn&#39;t have my quality of life hindered by that decision, I&#39;d get to grow old and hopefully die peacefully in my bed. If I were 20 years old, then yeah, I&#39;d want to wipe out 3/4 of the population, because if not, I would certainly be dying with the rest of the human race in those 50 years time at the conclusion of which humanity&#39;s extinction was certain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does that matter? Eventually we must go extinct anyway, why does it matter what happens in between now and then? Whatever happens is what will happen, and none of us will be around to witness it. Of course we all hope humanity will have a beautiful future as we should, but when the choice is between extinction and butchering a majority of the population, I think all considerations about humanity&#39;s hopes and dreams fly right out the window.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m not, but when we&#39;re talking about hypothetical ethical dilemmas where the choice is between two shit outcomes, to me, the ethical merits of those choices become largely nullified. If I had the choice between society living in a dark ages style feudalistic society for a billion years, or a star trek NG style utopia for a million years, I&#39;d go with the star trek civilization to be sure. I just don&#39;t particularly place the value of the human experience primarily in how long it lasts. 50 years of the way things are now, until an eventual extinction event, or wipe out 3/4 of the population and have a chance to continue on past those 50 years. They&#39;re both pretty shit. I can&#39;t imagine either outcome being particularly desirable for the human race. The prospect of merely surviving doesn&#39;t really establish value to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s good to have all segments of a population involved in decision making. I&#39;d wager, rather, that it is the disproportionate power of older populations that results from an age based wealth gap. Typically, rich people don&#39;t lose their wealth as they get older, it just keeps growing, so naturally over time, when you average it out, older people will have more money and thus more power to buy representation in our moneyed politics. If you really wanted to get to the root of political problems, it&#39;d be money in politics, seeing as the over representation of certain groups has historically disenfranchised other less represented groups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The global cabal of U.N. Agenda 21 is behind global warming, regionalism, zoning, land and water use control, wealth redistribution, weakening and eventual replacement of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, global warming, cap and trade, Smart Grid, Smart Meters, carbon taxes, high gasoline prices, global citizens, IB World Schools, Common Core nationalized education standards, biofuels, Marxist advancement across the globe, food control, water access control via the Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST), gun control, health control, the Arab Spring/Winter, unchecked illegal immigration, and they are unstoppable.’</p>

<p>You mean the non binding action plan of the U.N. that was signed decades after all of these things were already in full force?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have three theories on David Icke.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He is genuine and has to live through the hell of being the one of the only people who knows of the existence of lizard people ruling the world. (Why is he alive, then.)</p></li>
<li><p>Seeing as he worked for the BBC before his &#39;awakening&#39;, he is controlled and/or compromised in some fashion by the powers that be. Perhaps they fucked his head up on purpose, and sent him out in the world to mix truth with fiction so the truth gets hidden in plain sight, so to speak.</p></li>
<li><p>He worked at the BBC as a sports journalist, couldn&#39;t handle the publicity and had a mental break down. Upon getting better, realised he had fucked his life up with that infamous interview, so decided to go balls deep with it and write semi-factual conspiracy books and use his negative publicity to his advantage.</p></li>

<p>Personally, number 3 seems the most likely for me, but believe what you want to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have thought about number 1 and 2 numerous times. With regards to no.1 I always think the same thing about what you put in the brackets. If his intentions where really good then why would they let him live. I mean yes he&#39;s no Michael Jackson or someone else who has power to influence large numbers of people but he still does &#39;damage&#39; to their agenda considering he interacts with many people. I mean other people have said less yet they where killed/silenced within a heart beat so why does he get to keep on going..... right?</p>

<p>After thinking about 1 I ended up thinking about 2. I remember reading somewhere that in the past it was easy to get rid of anyone that stood in the way of the agenda but now with technology and the internet etc The elites realised it would be hard to keep on extending the hit list. So they devised the plan to actually start informing the masses with the truth but the truth shrouded in some lies. Therefore it would become harder for people to distinguish between truth and lies fuelling the fire for conspiracy In a way.
TBH that&#39;s what I believe. I feel as though there is definitely some truth in what he says and not too say that he has some lies mixed amongst it all, but simply put, It just shouldn&#39;t be that easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you can plainly see attacks on anything involving human reproduction. Promotion of homosexuality and transgenderism. Destruction of marriage and family units through legalese. Encouraging women to divorce themselves from gender roles, pursue careers, and work through their reproductive years. Stimulating population growth through immigration instead of reproduction. There is just so much it&#39;s impossible to list it all. It&#39;s an obvious agenda and it&#39;s working. I personally think the normalization of homosexuality and transgenderism will have a massive impact as I predict the population of these people to grow at an insane degree once normalization truly kicks in. </p>
