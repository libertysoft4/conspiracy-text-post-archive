    <div class="md"><p>Pretty hard to shield yourself from criticism if Trump if you use reddit.  Any positive mention of him on any of the popular subreddits gets you downvotes.  </p>

<p>95% of articles about Trump on Worldnews and News are negative.  People who like Trump like his results.  Instead of pretending they don&#39;t exist i read about them.  I for example listen to right and left wing media and then develop an opinion for myself (I&#39;m not American but your politics is entertaining as hell).  He&#39;s easy tò criticize, he doesn&#39;t watch his mouth and is used to being able to say whatever he wants to whoever he wants.  </p>

<p>Also, since Russia failed liberal media is now trying to get him impeached with amendment 25.  If that doesn&#39;t scream fishy nothing will.  Please tell me how your &quot;Alzheimer&#39;s afflicted&quot; president is conspiring with Russia?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That statement is a little bit of a reach.  </p>

<p>When half the country is pushing for arrests, there is a good chance there will be an arrest.  It doesn&#39;t matter if it was a minor crime or it is barely related.  That&#39;s what happens in these massive government criminal investigations.  I&#39;m actually more then pleased that nothing substancial was dug up on Trump and his family considering his involment in global affairs as one of the richest people in the USA.  More reason to offer my support.  </p>

<p>Like i said, attack my opinion all I want, but I just do this as a hobby.  I&#39;m an outsider, non-american.  I have no reason to support Trump or his narrative aside from his policy and his actions.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I feel like no matter what I say, you&#39;re going to say that I&#39;m being controlled by the media.</p>

<p>I just wonder... why do you think all this? Have you never considered that he&#39;s a bad president? Have you never looked objectivelu at his presidency and seen the ups and the downs?</p>

<p>Heres my opinion that I&#39;ve gleaned from statistics and news: he&#39;s good for the economy. However, there is definitely some shady shit going on behind the scenes that i dont like that ill delve into more if you want me to. He&#39;s also making an embarrassment of us globally with his attitude.</p>

<p>Finally, I consider my most important political value to be the environment. Trump has done only bad things for the environment (selling public land, drilling oil, withdrawing from paris, etc.) so i don&#39;t like him.</p>

<p>Now, do you still believe I&#39;m being controlled by propaganda? Can&#39;t everything I say be backes up by objective fact?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The choice was between Hillary and Trump. An informed voter choosing Hillary is a psychopathic one. </p>

<p>This pretense of playing nice before the cameras as the standard for how a politician is to be perceived is why this procession of soulless weasels continue to line up for a chance to win the faux popularity contest of public acceptance.</p>

<p>A tough talking jocular personality rose to the occasion after a long drought of creepy nerds still hung up on being a dork in high school, with their repressed emotion propped up on neo Marxist, feminist creep thinking, trying to manipulate the ordinary thought processes of those normies they so hate.</p>

<p>They undermined democracy by ousting Bernie. They undermine it by colluding with media. They undermine it still now manipulating the people against who won the public acceptance contest.</p>

<p>The creepy dorks were rejected once more. And they didn&#39;t grow up playing sports to appreciate fair play and learn how to lick their wounds and walk away like adults. They&#39;re stuck in their adolescent perception of reality with their Marxist fantasies of government imposed equality, AKA slavery.</p>

<p>No wonder they&#39;re pedophiles!</p>

<p>Weren&#39;t there 4 supreme court rulings from the late 90&#39;s to like 2015 or something?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea, but in a way we&#39;re both right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2015, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, under Mr. Obama, issued a contrary ruling, deciding on a vote of three Democrats to two Republicans that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was illegal. That ruling, which was reviewed by the Obama administration’s Justice Department, did not formally bind the federal courts, although courts often defer to federal agencies when they interpret laws that come under their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In its brief, the Trump administration’s Justice Department said the E.E.O.C., which had also filed court papers supporting Mr. Zarda, was “not speaking for the United States.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it wasnt official, but recommended. And considering gay marriage is legal now, it really should be a protected class.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is the bakery different than the Seattle coffee shop owner (Ben Borgman) and why isn&#39;t he getting a court case?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the article you link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Members of the group had been inside of his business distributing a disturbing flyer (see here if you must) depicting blood-covered rainbow hands letting go of an aborted fetus, which has no place in any public setting, let alone a coffee shop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If straight people came in and ordered a coffee and he banned them, then sure. But they were disrupting his business and handing out disgusting fliers: he had every right to send them away.</p>

<p>The CO Baker case could be a landmark for gay rights, and add lgbt to the civil rights act officially. This case is just a guy sending people out of his store, and a court case wouldn&#39;t really be a landmark decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your answer.   Thanks.</p>

<p>&quot;it [LGBT] really should be a protected class.&quot; - agreed</p>

<p>I linked the article I did specifically because the source called him a hero more than anything else.  I do believe they had handed out some stuff in the shop previously and he told them that would not be allowed.  I do believe that on this day, the religious group was outside handing them out and they came in for a beverage.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see it as simply someone sending people out of their store.  His own words say as much</p>

<p>The coffee shop owner kicked out a protected class.  So lets say we make LGBT a protected class tomorrow.  If you set the precedent that being a protected class by law doesn&#39;t actually afford you protections, then what would stop a business owner from discriminating against LGBT in our hypothetical tomorrow?</p>

<p>&quot;he had every right to send them away&quot; - OK, so a private business has the right to refuse service unless the class is a protected class.  Or maybe not since the Christians got kicked out?  And maybe you don&#39;t need to be a protected class since the bakery saw their day in court? </p>

<p>Do you feel the pamphlet was inappropriate?  Was his language inappropriate?  Don&#39;t each have the right to express themselves freely as long as they are within the law? </p>

<p>OK, so according to you, a protected group can be kicked out using language such as this because they handed stuff out in his business.  So let us use that logic.  If a non-protected group such as LGBT came into a coffee shop and handed out fliers for something, the owner is perfectly fine to unleash an expletive laced tirade and kick them out and &quot;all their fucking friends&quot;?  I don&#39;t think you would agree.   What exactly are you saying here?</p>

<p>This whole thing really makes no sense.  If there was ever any clarity on this issue, it is now gone.  </p>

<p>Maybe instead of creating endless classes of people and putting them in many unique boxes each with their own flag, we should protect human rights under one flag.  </p>

<p>Surely a measurement for the charge of objective falsehood would be met with the supplementation of objective measurements for the charge. But not in Weasel World, I guess. Objectivity and subjectivity are interchangable in FANTASY LAND, at least if you&#39;re asking a Marxist transgender who will profess gender to be optional, though it is a concept of inherent and pure abstraction that has no substance for objective measurement, and therefore no basis on which it can be objectively proposed to be objective whatsoever.</p>

<p>And so the drawing of the line in the sand is pressed upon by the hand of one who envisages himself entitled to the false reality of being free from experiencing insult. </p>

<p>...but that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing to ME. YOUR suggestion is insulting <em>this</em> direction just the same! </p>

<p>Driving is a privilege, not a right. Right? Why? Because we don&#39;t all magically function in accordance with a pre-ordained system. It&#39;s called FREE WILL. And with it, sometimes we CRASH.

Generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America, with half a billion solar panels installed by the end of Hillary’s first term.
Cut energy waste in American homes, schools, hospitals and offices by a third and make American manufacturing the cleanest and most efficient in the world.
Reduce American oil consumption by a third through cleaner fuels and more efficient cars, boilers, ships, and trucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Paris Agreement was based on the exact same study debated in my first link. There is a political agenda attached to it just like everything else. The agreement would have cost an avg. of $7,000 per citizen annually because of the manufacturing restrictions. These restrictions wouldn’t hurt corporations in a negative way or reduce the emissions though. They would just outsource the production to countries such as India and China for half the cost with little to no restriction. China is exempt from the Paris Agreement until at least 2030 even though their emissions are the largest in the world outside of volcanoes. Did you know over 1500 private jets to shuttle people into last year’s summit? Clearly there is a lack of consideration such things are having on our planet by the major players involved. Until the people pushing this bullshit down our throats start living like it’s a threat, remain skeptical as fuck. </p>

<p>Whether or not Trump is a bigot is a personal opinion. It&#39;s one that I agree with, but it&#39;s an opinion. To then turn around and hate on everyone who voted for him or showed support for him makes you a bigot. You are placing a label on a large group of people who it may or may not relate to. I bet some people who voted for him or agree with his policies are nice people.</p>

<p>May 31, 2014 “Unemployment is a totally phony number.”</p>

<p>June 16, 2015 “Our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don&#39;t believe the 5.6. Don&#39;t believe it.”</p>

<p>Aug. 11, 2015 “Then you hear there&#39;s a 5.4 percent unemployment. It&#39;s really — if you add it up, it&#39;s probably 40 percent if you think about it.”</p>

<p>Aug. 30, 2015 “They show those phony statistics where we are 5.4 percent unemployment. The real number, I saw a number that could be 42 percent, believe it or not.”</p>

<p>Sept. 28, 2015 “I hear 5.3 percent unemployment, that is the biggest joke there is in this country. That number is so false.”</p>

<p>Sept. 29, 2015 “The number is not reflective. I have seen numbers of 24 percent. I saw a number of 42 percent unemployment. … That number is so false.”</p>

<p>Oct. 9, 2015 “They say 5.3 percent employment. The number is probably 32 percent.”</p>

<p>Oct. 11, 2015 “Nobody has jobs. … It is not a real economy. It is a phony set of numbers. They cooked the books.”</p>

<p>Jan. 17, 2016 “Look again, you hear these phony jobs numbers? People that gave up looking for jobs? They are considered employed.”</p>

<p>Feb. 9, 2016 “Don&#39;t believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. As high as 35 — as in fact, I heard recently, 42 percent.”</p>

<p>March 12, 2016 “The numbers are phony. These are all phony numbers. Numbers given to politicians to look good. These are phony numbers.”</p>

<p>May 24, 2016 “You hear a 5 percent unemployment rate. It&#39;s such a phony number. That number was put in for presidents and for politicians so that they look good to the people.” July 7, 2016 “The phony 5 percent numbers that we hear about with the unemployment.”</p>

<p>Aug. 8, 2016 “The 5 percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.”</p>

<p>Nov. 4, 2016 “The terrible jobs report that just came out … you can see phony numbers, 5 percent.”</p>

<p>Regardless, you&#39;ve succeeded in boring me.  Keep insulting, repeating yourself and telling the world what a captain of industry you are.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s so vitally important that you win this argument with an old man you will never meet and don&#39;t know a thing about.</p>

<p>Your generation takes itself much to seriously.   There was a time when people could disagree and it was called conversation.  You should try it sometime.</p>

<p>(And now you will rail about how you can&#39;t do that because Trump is literally Hitler and THE WORLD depends on everyone knowing that.  They said the same thing about Reagan and Bush Senior. Guess what - those were some pretty good times to be alive.)  </p>

<p>Given that my mother is dead and never to my knowledge owned a basement, you have again made the common white nationalist response to everyone who doesn&#39;t follow the politically correct line.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a time when people could disagree and it was called conversation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Were we discussing baseball teams or blues musicians, then we could agree to disagree. You have supported a fascist pretender and continually spouted white nationalist talking points. There is no room for compromise with right wing authoritarian politics. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>those were some pretty good times to be alive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is always the line from those who profit. Ahhh, the good old days when women were pussies to grab and gay was a word that meant happy.</p>

<p>But Trump isn&#39;t &quot;literally Hitler&quot;. Trump isn&#39;t smart enough to even read a book about Hitler much less emulate him. And Hitler wasn&#39;t actually that smart of guy himself as most authoritarians suffer from major psychological and emotional disabilities throughout their lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;White nationalist.&quot;  I will have to tell my wife that tomorrow AM.  She will be shocked.  She&#39;s known me for 40+ years and would likely identify me as neither.  </p>

<p>You seem very angry about this whole profit things and men who seek profits.  Fascinating.</p>

<p>An odd thought pattern for a captain of industry such as yourself.   Here&#39;s a secret - most people who made a real difference in this world had profit and power in mind.  </p>

<p>I proudly say I worked my butt off for decades to make money for myself and my family.  I&#39;m sure that must horrify you.  I also ate beef jerky, wore leather shoes, and used petroleum products.</p>

<p>Again, with the insults disguised as fact, but here&#39;s the real fact. Trump is in the White House.  You are not.   So call him whatever you want and he won&#39;t care.  Frankly I don&#39;t either.</p>

<p>Sorry about your mom.  You really should have kept that basement door locked.  Walking in on you like that - hard on the heart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That statement is a little bit of a reach.  </p>

<p>When half the country is pushing for arrests, there is a good chance there will be an arrest.  It doesn&#39;t matter if it was a minor crime or it is barely related.  That&#39;s what happens in these massive government criminal investigations.  I&#39;m actually more then pleased that nothing substancial was dug up on Trump and his family considering his involment in global affairs as one of the richest people in the USA.  More reason to offer my support.  </p>

<p>Like i said, attack my opinion all I want, but I just do this as a hobby.  I&#39;m an outsider, non-american.  I have no reason to support Trump or his narrative aside from his policy and his actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Paris Agreement was based on the exact same study debated in my first link. There is a political agenda attached to it just like everything else. The agreement would have cost an avg. of $7,000 per citizen annually because of the manufacturing restrictions. These restrictions wouldn’t hurt corporations in a negative way or reduce the emissions though. They would just outsource the production to countries such as India and China for half the cost with little to no restriction. China is exempt from the Paris Agreement until at least 2030 even though their emissions are the largest in the world outside of volcanoes. Did you know over 1500 private jets to shuttle people into last year’s summit? Clearly there is a lack of consideration such things are having on our planet by the major players involved. Until the people pushing this bullshit down our throats start living like it’s a threat, remain skeptical as fuck. </p>
