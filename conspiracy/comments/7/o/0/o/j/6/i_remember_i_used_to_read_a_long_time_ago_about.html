<p>Russia has government money buying up Bitcoin</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency could already be the path to an authoritarian state as every transaction is publicly viewable. People think that it&#39;s a way to conceal your identity but it&#39;s the exact opposite. </p>

If you notice, you can&#39;t buy bc with cash, you sign up to an exchange whereby you send them a copy of your id. From there you buy some crypto and transfer it to your hardware wallet. That&#39;s totally traceable.</p>

<p>Precious metals do pretty much exactly what Cryptos do but they are truly anonymous, and while they have drawbacks, at least they don&#39;t promote further enslavement</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I&#39;ve been wanting to by some crypto currency with cash for a few weeks. I keep finding scam site after scam site according to Reddit, and still haven&#39;t found a site that I can use cash to buy crypto. Maybe someone will come along here to tell me how though.</p>

<p>But this is the big problem. It&#39;s not accessible. Until that happens, it is still a pipe dream. Once it is accessible, easy, and quick to use (like I can buy stuff at a store instantaneously like I do with my credit card), it won&#39;t take off and will just be the currency people use to do illegal stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. I doubt it. America is like the banks it bails out. Too big to fail. We can say what we want about the government and the world stage but we are not going anywhere. Especially in two years. Unless theres a catastrophe on a global scale. Every generation thinks they are the doomed ones. Infrastructure will be rebuilt and new great companies will be made with great new inventions across all fields. Have you ever asked yourself where does all the money go people use to buy these crypto currencies? All the fees to trade it go in whos pocket? What happens when there is no more buyers and  every one is left trying to sell it back to fantasy land ? Once taxes and laws are implemented we will see who the winners and losers are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take you up on that challenge.</p>

<p>The FACT is that when they print more money, the value of your dollar goes down and my btc goes up. </p>

<p>Simple economics bud. I&#39;m not saying the &quot;end is near&quot; I&#39;m just tired of working for something that gets constantly devalued by TPTB. </p>

<p>How many years have you studied finance, economics, worked in the financial industry and or crypto industry? Because it doesn&#39;t sound like much at all.</p>

<p>You could make the same argument about no more buyers of gold, but gold only goes up compared to the dollar over time because one is scarce and the other isn&#39;t. It&#39;s not that difficult of a concept for someone who actually studies this stuff on a daily basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me start buy saying who ever makes money with it god bless. But as a long term thing its not resonable. You can study it all you want. Its brand new and you cant compare it to anything else besides maybe the tech boom in the early 2000s and how many companies made it out of that bubble. You never answered my queation either...what happens when governments demand identity and want taxes? Besides the fact you can do shady shit with it wheres the actual value? It will only take one &quot;terrorist organization&quot; or extreme money laundering and the whole thing fails. Countries having their own markets is what keeps the balance. Why would the entire planet want to use only j.p morgan bucks ,walmart dollars, or amazon coins? It doesnt make sense when you look at the whole thing amd what it could turn in to. Thats why it will fail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just saw this one - you&#39;re all over the place.</p>

<p>Btc just celebrated its 9th birthday.</p>

<p>The tech crash was an amazing buying opportunity. I would be ecstatic to see btc at $100 again. </p>

<p>If the govt demands ID, then either give it to them or move to another country. I&#39;ll deal with that when it happens.</p>

<p>You can do shady shit with cash. We sent tons of cash to Isis.</p>

<p>How would money laundering or terror groups using btc cause it to crash? It&#39;s happened before and btc only gets stronger.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a currency or an asset. It doesn&#39;t mean counties could have their own market and there are other cryptocurrecies out there. Plus we live in a very globalized market that has only increased productivity, not hindered it. Not many counties have their own secluded market.</p>

<p>Most of the world uses USD as the base currency. Which is basically &quot;FEDbucks&quot; and pretty close to a jpmorgan coin.</p>

<p>It actually makes a lot of sense when you study finance and economics. That&#39;s why I was more than giddy to buy my first btc in 2013 and never looked back.</p>

<p>It could fail, but so could the US dollar. If I had to bet, it obviously won&#39;t be on the dollar. But time will tell. Best of luck to us both!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apples and bananas are not scarce assets. That&#39;s why. Apples and bananas are actually a lot closer to the dollar than gold, silver or btc.</p>

<p>I actually do study this every day. I went from being a stockbroker to working for a crypto exchange last summer. So to answer your first question, the money goes to whoever is selling the asset. It&#39;s how markets work. An asset is traded and the seller keeps the profit. When you buy a car or house, who gets the money? The seller who purchased the asset earlier in time.</p>

<p>Who gets the fees for trading on the exchange? The people who build and/or work for the exchange that people are willing to pay to use. So essentially I receive some of that money.</p>

<p>Any other questions? This is fun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin is not a store of wealth. It is a medium of exchange. You should not “invest” in it IMO, but rather hold it for the purpose of spending it. </p>

<p>Thus are the 2 functions of money; we have forgotten it in the West because the dollar (and dollar-backed currencies) have (more or less) been fulfilling both roles.</p>

<p>But go to the third-world and you’ll see people trade with the legal tender, and save in dollars (or gold).</p>

<p>After we separate money and State, it is my estimation people will trade in p2p crypto-money (superior to precious metals as a medium of exchange) and save in gold or silver (superior to digital money as a store of wealth).</p>

<p>Look into FOFOA’s freegold exposé for additional insight on this.</p>

<p>One another thought: crypto-enthusiasts should <em>welcome</em> the demise of a given crypto-currency, as that would mean the emergence of a better one. That’s what it’s about: competition and trial-and-error. Thus it doesn’t make sense to hold large amounts of it for long periods of time (unless you’re a gambler).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d have to disagree. Yes, money is just currency. But you can use this stuff that is printed from nothing, and create real value from it. 
For example, to pay for weapons to be made (cost money), in which case you secretly send (cost money) them to your proxy army (who you pay money) whom helps sow discord across the planet, which in turn gives you a reason to keep creating and giving more funds to your miltary or nation. Over time, you can acquire whole nation&#39;s from this meaningless paper (if you know what you are doing). Or another example is, over time you can acquire what you want people to think, by using money to pay for people to sow discord via the MSM and throughout the internet.<br/>
And the rich more or less generate limitless funds due to the interest their money (debts) earns sitting in the bank (instead of trickling down into the economy).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I believe it is the opposite. It is more than just bitcoin. There are a bunch of promising cryptos. All of them decentralized. Not a single world cashless currency issued by a central bank of the world to enslave everyone. The people decide which coins they believe are valuable by owning, trading and using them.  I see it like the dotcom bubble.. a bunch of ideas that are in their infancy most of which are crap and won&#39;t amount to anything but some will survive and become legitimate. Now it is all totally unregulated and you have manipulators like John McAfee running pump and dump scams so it&#39;s a far cry from the libertarian dream of sound currency. The exchanges are always overloaded and the sites go down all the time so it&#39;s a wonky system but everyday there are more options to spend your coin online. Overstock accepts several. If it comes together the right way it could be the death of the banks. Sadly I&#39;m sure it will all be used against us but until they figure it out it&#39;s fun to gamble on and hope for the best. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say over half if not 3 quarters of the people who invest in crypto simply follow the gains and mcafee type hype, they have no idea about what they are investing in apart from the basics.</p>

<p>A clever marketing and shill campaign can very very easily swing &#39;the people&#39; towards and coin (((they))) chose. Out of all the search engines why is google pretty much the only one people ever use?  Did the people choose it or were they led to it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, there&#39;s room in the market to pump and dump shit coins AND hold onto coins that actually have some decent tech behind them. You&#39;ll see both proliferate in the short term. In the long term, if a coin is solid, people will stick with it and word of mouth will spread, with them eventually overtaking the pump &#39;n dumps, which will slowly fizzle out as people realize their technical flaws.</p>

<p>Bitcoin requires too much electricity. That&#39;s bad for the environment. I&#39;d prefer a coin that can secure the chain without using so many resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe it will become a one-world currency or some variation of it will. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I don&#39;t like it because of <strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/14/7546669/silk-road-trial-bitcoin-tracking">how very traceable</a></strong> it is.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at Puerto Rico right now. As of 5 days ago, they have restored power to 55% of the population months after the hurricane. Imagine if you were in the group of the 45% who don&#39;t have reliable power sources right now. Trying to use your BTC would probably be pretty damn difficult. Most likely not impossible but not easy.</p></li>
<li><p>A bit more nefarious but it latches on to my example above. What if someone didn&#39;t like you so much. Maybe your name is Julian Assange or Edward Snowden. I&#39;m not so sure your money couldn&#39;t be taken very easily making life pretty hard on you. People go on about how secure it is if you are careful but I&#39;m not so sure. We don&#39;t even know who invented it. That&#39;s a bit weird.  </p></li>
<li><p>It is insanely volatile. I keep a notebook next to my computer and I just jot things down. I am taking these numbers off the top of my head because I discarded that page but a week or so before Christmas I was watching some of the crazy price movements so for 3 days when I&#39;d think about it I would look up the price and then jot it down with the time/date. At one point I watched it swing about $500 in an hour and over the 3-day period, I saw swings as wild as 2k per 1 BTC. In theory, you could check your BTC balance, make a quick shopping list then drive to the store, find the items you want and then have lost $500 in value (<em>or maybe more</em>) when you go to pay for things with your magic money.</p></li>
<li><p>An all cashless society can be a dangerous one. Take a look at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/mar/29/10-lessons-cyprus-bailout">this list</a> that was pulled together after Cyprus decided to bail out their banks by making the questionable move of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/29/bank-of-cyprus-depositors-lose-savings/2595837/">taking a high percentage of money from people&#39;s accounts</a> to help the government and very banks who created their financial problems. </p></li>
<li><p>And a final point on the move to an all cashless society which is tied into number 5 above as well. Take a look at what happens when countries start implementing <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative-interest-rate-policy-nirp.asp">negative interest rate policies</a>. At that point, you are paying the bank the pleasure to have your money. If the government needs a little juice the central bank and deflate interest rates some more because they are trying to encourage spending which just drives down your savings and increases debt. You don&#39;t have a choice in the matter. If all money is electronic and your country goes negative you are screwed. If we maintain a system of every country having a central bank of their own but a one world currency your bank is making float (<em>they do it anyway but this just feels even more wrong</em>) off your money as they do overnight lending to other banks in other nations.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> There are a lot of f&#39;d up reasons why people should not want this. Sorry my list is so long but it is actually pretty hard to summarize it down because there are so many bad things about this.</p>

<p>LOL... everyone is an ignorant investor except when they are not.</p>

<p>I hold hard currencies, precious metals and stocks across industries. Raytheon made me a lot this past year because I saw what was coming with Trump and I went heavy on defense stocks whether I agree with the morality of it or not. I was also an early BTC investor but jumped out because I&#39;m pragmatic. </p>

<p>Let me put it to you this way. My work heavily involves sales. Things coming in and things going out. Every quarter I&#39;d rather stand in a QBR (quateryly business review) with sales people who are going to tell me the truth about what their projected sales are rather than those who inflate numbers because of perceived job security. I need to know if the business is forecasting at 5% growth or 5% decline so I can make smart decisions on what to do next. Don&#39;t worry about saving your ass... worry about sharing the truth so the right choices can be made for everyone. </p>

<p>BTC is kind of the same way. When it swings so rapidly and no one can predict where the hell it will end up I&#39;m not interested because it gives me no clear picture to the future.</p>

<p>If you all make a bunch of money off it I&#39;m happy for you but don&#39;t get butthurt when others raise valid concerns.</p>

<p>sure... keep the stories floating in &quot;person X made amount Y with bitcoin!&quot; -- doesn&#39;t change the fact that nobody can use it effectively. i assume they gained some form of control of it (sooooo much invested in bitcoin mining) and because of that it is lately hitting mainstream outlets.</p>

<p>we have enough other cryptos. cryptos are here to last. bitcoin can be honored as a pioneer, but i doubt it will remain at &quot;the top&quot; for much longer. the market spread and doesn&#39;t channel into a single crypto.</p>

Where it will require a computer of some sort (smartphone), an account, and of course electricity and connection to the internet in order to buy and sell. ALL transactions can and will be tracked. And your ability to buy and sell can easily be shut down.</p>

<p>I would say so far it&#39;s been a rousing success. The Alt Media is complicit in it&#39;s introduction, from those who are knowingly pushing it (like Andy Hoffman, who accidentally exposed himself and the &#39;agenda&#39; at SGTReport) to those who are just following the herd, and those motivated by greed (which I would say is the majority). Remember Alt Media is NOT Truth Media. There are some Truth seekers and tellers in the Alt Media, but not near as many as you might think. And every day the Alt Media becomes more and more polluted by those who either want to control it, or destroy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin cannot be created at will, like fiat.</p>

<p>Bitcoin cannot be seized by TPTB.</p>

<p>No one can ever be denied access to their Bitcoin.  </p>

<p>Banks, governments, and corporations have no special treatment, they all must play by the same rules as you or me.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is good, but there is nothing stopping TPTB from cloning it and making a new private blockchain under their control.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would think r/conspiracy would have been all about something that took so much power away from TPTB, but instead of supporting the change we&#39;ve always dreamed of, they bash it.</p>

<p>No wonder taking down the TPTB is so hard, the ones who constantly talk about it are nothing but talk! If they really believed in half the shit this sub constantly complains about, they would have been supporting btc since the first day they heard about it. Instead they just want to complain more. Without doing any research of their own.</p>

<p>Looks like r/conspiracy and Jamie Diamon have a lot more in common than they think!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the 4% own 95% of BTC statement, that’s quite false.</p>

<p>This is like saying the bank owns all money it keeps instead of the people who use it. Yes, 95% of BTC is kept at banks (like Coinbase.com) but it’s allocated to users.</p>

<p>All this is really saying is only 5% of Bitcoins are kept in hardware wallets or cold storage, which isn’t really too surprising.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d have to disagree. Yes, money is just currency. But you can use this stuff that is printed from nothing, and create real value from it. 
For example, to pay for weapons to be made (cost money), in which case you secretly send (cost money) them to your proxy army (who you pay money) whom helps sow discord across the planet, which in turn gives you a reason to keep creating and giving more funds to your miltary or nation. Over time, you can acquire whole nation&#39;s from this meaningless paper (if you know what you are doing). Or another example is, over time you can acquire what you want people to think, by using money to pay for people to sow discord via the MSM and throughout the internet.<br/>
And the rich more or less generate limitless funds due to the interest their money (debts) earns sitting in the bank (instead of trickling down into the economy).</p>

<p>Remember IBMs &quot;Watson?&quot; That was year&#39;s and year&#39;s ago. I am not saying it is skyrocketing forward like most technology but it&#39;s for sure moved ahead and maybe even in the black budget areas is even further ahead (speculation) but AI is a thing.</p>

<p>Hell Google uses a form of AI. The phone I&#39;m typing on has an even more archaic form in it&#39;s autocorrect as it learns words from repetition or from manually being added to its dictionary.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying we have Turing test capable AI but it&#39;s a large spectrum with, afaik, a pretty amazing yet dated example having been showcased by IBM through Jeopardy years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take you up on that challenge.</p>

<p>The FACT is that when they print more money, the value of your dollar goes down and my btc goes up. </p>

<p>Simple economics bud. I&#39;m not saying the &quot;end is near&quot; I&#39;m just tired of working for something that gets constantly devalued by TPTB. </p>

<p>How many years have you studied finance, economics, worked in the financial industry and or crypto industry? Because it doesn&#39;t sound like much at all.</p>

<p>You could make the same argument about no more buyers of gold, but gold only goes up compared to the dollar over time because one is scarce and the other isn&#39;t. It&#39;s not that difficult of a concept for someone who actually studies this stuff on a daily basis.</p>
