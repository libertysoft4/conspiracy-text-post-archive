<p>Unlike the initial reports suggested about Intel chips being vulnerable to some severe ‘memory leaking’ flaws, full technical details about the vulnerabilities have now been emerged, which revealed that almost every modern processor since 1995 is vulnerable to the issues.
Disclosed today by Google Project Zero, the vulnerabilities potentially impact all major CPUs, including those from AMD, ARM, and Intel—threatening almost all PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, regardless of manufacturer or operating system.</p>

<p>30% won&#39;t be relevant for end users. This effect will almost only be felt by cloud providers that use kernel heavy applications across multiple VMs. The performance impact for endusers is in the 1-5% range. </p>

<p>This is wrong. An attacker can&#39;t take over you system. He can &quot;only&quot; read the content of your RAM. This exploit can&#39;t execute code on your system. It can sniff out your credentials and data though.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually a very well documented exploit by the researchers. Check out <a href="https://meltdownattack.com">https://meltdownattack.com</a></p>

<p>Disclaimer: Fuck Intel for downplaying this issue. It&#39;s a massive security issue for cloud and hosting providers. The biggest I&#39;ve seen yet.</p>

<p>There are actually MULTIPLE flaws being released January 1st, 2nd and 3rd. And has caused CHAOS across the security spectrum (CIA/NSA specialty)</p>

<p>Basically multiple vulnerabilities, some zero day, some are just memory leaks, all released the last 3 days, and not one article asking how it is that for 2 DECADES many of these &#39;flaws&#39; were not known?</p>

<p>The issue arises if multiple users share an infrastructure. The consultants will likely feel slow down if they use a centralized host, yes.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak for other exploits or zero days. Those might very well compromise systems.</p>

<p>How it wasn&#39;t found earlier is a very good question though. Even more so because 4 groups separately researched the same bug. I&#39;d very interested in the background that prompted the research. </p>

<p>Damn... was afraid of that. At least I&#39;m only vulnerable to the other one.</p>

<p>And, I&#39;m not that concerned about the fix. I really only use that rig for gaming so, yea, nbd. Regarding the security side of things.. I mean, anyone with that many resources and that much willpower to fvck me could probably find an easier way. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that severe for the end user since the software for the exploit has to be run locally can &quot;only&quot; read information and not execute code itself. The information gained (user/ password for instance) might be used to run code though.</p>

<p>It&#39;s speculated that it is possible to use this exploit through Java script on web pages though to gain the memory data of your browser, like credentials and key strokes. But this isn&#39;t confirmed yet afaik. </p>

<p>The Primary concern here is Meltdown, and that is an Intel only bug. <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/00a5ae218d57741088068799b810416ac249a9ce#diff-678874d00bf0df04f6f427f16f1dea36R926">Proof:</a> </p>

<p>I am truly concerned with NSA spying and backdoors. But ignorant posts like this do more harm the cause than good. We have plenty of real issues to be upset about like ME and PSP without having to make up fairy tales to attack the NSA.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t true, this is a true compromise of the system, the ability to load and execute undetected, these are kernel level exploits to the processor not RAM.</p>

<p>There are 8 vulnerabilities, 7 require physical access and no administrative credentials, and 1 can be exploited remotely but requires administrative credentials.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000025619/software.html">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000025619/software.html</a></p>

<p>What complicates this even further is the amount of remediation required, it is a combination of hardware specific firmware updates, OS specific updates, and hypervisor updates.</p>

<p>AWS underlying infrastructure was relatively unaffected because of the hardware they predominantly use and addressed the issue several weeks ago, Microsoft Azure on the other hand is doing hard reboots tonight across their entire infrastructure to address the vulnerability.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t OS patches still needed to be done for AWS and Azure instances that customers own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>K, I just read the meltdown paper.  I see why you are concerned.  From my perspective, this is nothing new.  Their exploit uses either an exception handler or a TAX.</p>

<p>Here I am disclosing to the public for the first time a vulnerability I have known for 7 years.  Exception handlers are called from the kernel and return using an iret instruction.  You can change debug registers and control registers in the call stack and the iret will clobber those system registers.</p>

<p>This is why MS instituted safe exception handling, but they never explained it to the public.</p>

<p>In short, at least on Windows (I haven&#39;t checked elsewhere) exception handlers let you inject code into the kernel.</p>

<p>Thanks for correcting me on this, it was more nuanced than I though.  But it is time to fix exception handling, it&#39;s been a decade now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I appreciate that.  Since we&#39;re talking:</p>

<p>NSAKEY is completely benign.  It allows DoD to replace the password prompt with things like retina scanners, without MS being involved beyond storing that key.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>K, I just read the meltdown paper.  I see why you are concerned.  From my perspective, this is nothing new.  Their exploit uses either an exception handler or a TSX.</p>

<p>Here I am disclosing to the public for the first time a vulnerability I have known for 7 years.  Exception handlers are called from the kernel and return using an iret instruction.  You can change debug registers and control registers in the call stack and the iret will clobber those system registers.</p>

<p>This is why MS instituted &quot;safe exception handling,&quot; but they never explained it to the public.  It isn&#39;t mandatory and it&#39;s security is based on obscurity, anyway.</p>

<p>In short, at least on Windows (I haven&#39;t checked elsewhere) exception handlers let you inject code into the kernel.</p>

<p>Thanks for correcting me on this, it was more nuanced than I though.  But it is time to fix exception handling, it&#39;s been a decade now.</p>

<p>&quot;Fixing&quot; the TLB cache seems like the wrong fix.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t read kernel memory with this vuln, only locate a target to read.  If there are actual vulns allowing code to read arbitrary kernel memory, those are serious, and the TLB issue makes them more efficient, but that&#39;s it.  As a sysadmin, you should be concerned about the actual vulns, not a side piece that accelerates them.</p>

<p>Kernel developers aren&#39;t usually impressed with sysadmins, fwiw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I have stated, 3 major &#39;flaws&#39; were released in the last three days which affect ALL 3 major consumer OS platforms.</p>

<p>I agree with you though, The Management Engine is yet another NSA backdoor, and it&#39;s not new, since researchers have been pointing this out for years.</p>

<p>THE IMPORTANT THING you need to keep in mind, is that the NSA isn&#39;t dumb, they don&#39;t approach this issue with 1 or even 2 backdoors and tools at their disposal.</p>

<p>The NSA takes a, for lack of a better term, Broad Spectrum Star Trek shield modulation approach.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hard Drive Hardware Firmware</li>
<li>On Chip Hardware Backdoors and Indentifiers</li>
<li>Software Based Attacks</li>
<li>Encryption security hijacking</li>
<li>Transport layer </li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, we&#39;re fucked. And it&#39;s not even the NSA per se that scares me it&#39;s the &#39;after market/black market&#39; for all these built in security flaws that results after the NSA is done with it whereby they sell the info and tools to police, private investigators, data aggregators, etc etc etc..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The TLB issue that is dominating the news isn&#39;t an actual vulnerability, it&#39;s merely a weakness of defense in depth, because it decloaks kernel ASLR.  ASLR itself is a defense against vulns, but not the first line defense.  And the TLB cache doesn&#39;t even fully weaken it.</p>

<p>So the TLB issue is a total non issue.</p>

<p>If anything it&#39;s being treated as a major issue because it might also decloak NSA kernel injections, so fixing it might make us worse off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the patch IS the backdoor lol.  the performance hit is related to the hidden services that provide a real-time feed to the spooks.  it&#39;s an upgrade to an existing backdoor.  just speculation, but the move to get the fix out seems kinda pushy...</p>
