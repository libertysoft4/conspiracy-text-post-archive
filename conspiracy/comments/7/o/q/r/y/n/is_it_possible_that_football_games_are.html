<p>Intentionally is a stronger word than necessary here.  They fielded a cheaper team made of younger players for years, seasoning the young players and getting good draft picks in the meantime.  Eventually, seasoned players and good drafting yielded a championship.  That script is not unusual.</p>

<p>Basketball and kinda football will have teams &quot;tank&quot; towards the end of the season to improve draft position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only the Pats and NYGiants have repeated in the past 15ish years.  Winning multiple SBs is hard business.</p>

<p>So, are the huge disasters picking cities with very good teams already in place?  It takes years to build a decent team, and, stunningly, a big disaster just happens to hit a city with an elite-level sports team poised to win it all.</p>

<p>How did Katrina know to hit NO?</p>

<p>How did the Houston floods know this was the year?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently justing winning one Super Bowl is tough buisness. The only time the Saints ever won, as talented as they have been, was after Katrina. Thats definetly an undeniable coincidence. Im not taking away anything from them, they had talent and won their way there, but theres no denying the coincidence.</p>

<p>Maybe its just as simple as the players having extra motivation; after such a disaster to play extra hard for their forsaken city and fallen comrades. Maybe its partially pity from opposing players, who have the disasters fresh in the minds and feel empathy for their opponents. Maybe its some sinister tech thats hidden from the public eye that makes these disaters happen or maybe its fate and god making these things happen. But there is something to it. </p>

<p>But that wasn&#39;t OPs assertion.  OP is saying no coincidence, that the games are fixed pending natural disaster/terror events.  I am saying none chance, and if there IS a connection there, it&#39;s from HAARP aiming their weather at cities with teams favored to win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right.  I allowed the factually inaccurate anti-NFL posters here to mislead me on the timeline.  I looked it up this AM, Brees and Payton arrived in 2006, a year after Katrina.  They&#39;ve been relevant since then.</p>

<p>Either way, zero connection.  Or... Katrina hits, conspiracy to now build a great team there so in 3-5 years they&#39;ll win it all!!!  Seems unlikely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sport in the U.S is a complete sideshow. It&#39;s not really even sport compared to how most other countries see/play it. It&#39;s all &quot; franchises &quot; rather than organically grown teams, with no relegation or promotion. It&#39;s just a merry go round of teams given their shot at winning.  A lot of U.S businessmen are to co-opt the English premier league to make it this way as well but it just doesn&#39;t work here. Fans are too tribal, you can&#39;t get away without investing huge amount of money each year on new players, unless you&#39;re Arsenal lol.</p>

<p>Well last night, the rams are trying to come back. Goff throws an inside slant to watkins. Gruden says, &quot;I was wondering when they&#39;d finally go back to their out digs.&quot; Well, the play was an inside slant so wtf. I had a brief moment of confusion. Well the next play comes immediately while gruden is finishing his atatement, and wouldn&#39;t you fucking know it? It was a fucking out dig.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lotsa people throwing around lotsa definitions in this thread.</p>

<p>Define fixed?  Typically, &quot;fixed&quot; is something Vegas does, it&#39;s a gambling term.</p>

<p>Influence games is something the refs do, with or without league instruction (NFL says keep game close, NBA says let stars play).</p>

<p>So, no league is going to announce a fix, nor would Vegas.</p>

<p>I do not doubt people are conspiring to fix games.  That, however, was not OPs assertion.  Of course people fix games, there are movies about it, and the shadowy figure on a college campus offering money for point shaving is a trope.</p>

<p>The OP assertion is the league, the NFL, is fixing games.  And that is comical.  Vegas would CRUSH the NFL if there was shenanigans (outside the realm of currently accepted sports shenanigans)(like home field advantage, stars get better treatment, etc).</p>

<p>People on this sub are so sure that <em>Reddit</em> is used by higher powers to influence public discourse, but OP is an idiot to assume the same is happening with sports?  Okay...</p>

<p>A post at the top of <a href="/r/All">/r/All</a> or an army of shill bots still can’t influence discourse like a professional athlete with a household name can.    You can spread a message to more Americans via Monday night football than you can with Reddit.  It would literally make more sense to use the NFL as a giant propaganda tool than Reddit, thanks to its level of exposure.  Seriously, guys, how many of your friends and family actually know anything about Pizza Gate or other major conspiracies discussed here, and then how many of them know about deflate gate?  </p>
