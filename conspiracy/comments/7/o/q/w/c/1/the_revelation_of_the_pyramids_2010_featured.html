<p>New Voids have been discovered in the pyramids just two months ago. We don&#39;t know what they are yet and can&#39;t look inside. The Egyptian authorities disagreed with the scientists so it looks like they won&#39;t get a permit to drill a small hole to shove a robot in the void.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the gatekeepers are the ones who refuse to look into the possibility that &#39;ancient history&#39; as we have been told it is all a fabrication.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6oTXmt4w70">see pic related</a></p>

<p>Ask yourself, how much <strong>primary source evidence</strong> have any of us seen to support claims about the lives of ancient figures of history?</p>

<p>If we are being honest, the answer is: none. Few of us have even read books more than 100 years old.</p>

<p>We simply take the authorities&#39; words for it: they <em>must</em> know, they are &#39;experts&#39;.</p>

<p>Why do so few of us stop to wonder how we could possibly know so much about what happened 2,000 years ago if none of the original material actually survived?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Such a great point.  How much do <em>we</em> <em>know?</em></p>

<p>The answer is: not much.  We can pretend though, and if there is one things humanity is great it it&#39;s pretending.  </p>

<p>We can have the &quot;experts,&quot; come in with their carbon dating machines, and papyrus records scribed thousands of years ago, with a culture that had a language with concepts that don&#39;t even exist in the modern age, yet we can still translate these texts near-verbatim...</p>

<p>Then, ever so slightly, over time, the story changes.  It shifts.  The goalposts are moved, yet again a few feet further.  First slaves built the pyramids.  Then well-paid workers.  </p>

<p>They have no fucking clue, at best they make ill-informed educated guesses against a backdrop of a society in the modern era.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I choose to believe that the Pharos built the pyramids through slave labor. They got the massive amount of work accomplish by brain washing the slaves with religion.</p>

<p>If people know this, then they will wonder if the same is true today, which it is.</p>

<p>The same blood lines that controlled Egypt never went away, instead they migrated across the world and established Babylon, Rome, the Khazarian empire and all other empires. They likely own today’s power structure as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans evolved from simpler species of ape (while homo sapiens specifically may have been genetically manipulated)<br/>
Physical matter is fundamentally not physical (energy in flux)<br/>
There are about 7 billion humans on earth today (earth isn&#39;t overpopulated, but many cities where the majority of humans are concentrated are)<br/>
Earth is spherical in shape (possibly hollow) and orbits the sun, which in turn orbits the galactic centre.<br/>
Humans have sent objects into space and walked on the moon (but they also faked some footage too because sometimes the genuine footage contains evidence of ET presence on/around earth and the moon)<br/>
Intelligent life exists on other planets.<br/>
Dinosaurs (not &quot;lizard-birds&quot;) existed millions of years ago.<br/>
Carbon-based life which existed millions of years ago eventually decomposed to form what we recognise as oil today (this includes dinosaurs, though the majority of oil is composed of decomposed ancient plant matter)<br/>
Earth&#39;s climate is changing (humans have influenced the current change in carbon within the atmosphere to a relevant degree)<br/>
Plato and Strabo were real people<br/>
The stories of the new testament of bible were collated together and written between/around 1,500-2,000 years ago, while the stories of the old testament were collated together over the previous ~2-12,000 years.<br/>
Mental illness is <em>due to</em> chemical imbalance in the brain, though causes vary from genetic to social reasons.<br/>
Some cancers can occur by chance, though most cancers have causes based in particular environmental exposure and chemical intake. Some can be treated by radiation, but most would require some chemical treatment.<br/>
State-funded education existed to benefit and educate the populace (though in many countries today that intention has been subverted in attempt to control the flow of information to the masses)<br/>
Taxation can be beneficial to the population (in theory, and in practice when applied relevantly)<br/>
Weapons exist that have the potential to destroy millions of humans very quickly in the right circumstances (the disinfo on this one is saying &quot;magical weapons&quot;)<br/>
Some of the &quot;leaders&quot; of some countries have opposing intentions to other &quot;leaders&quot; and so see each other as enemies.<br/>
A terrorist network exists (though it is funded and propped up by deep state entities)<br/>
Twice last century many countries went to war with one another in order to take control of the people.<br/>
A decent portion of pop culture content exists primarily to entertain the masses (though obviously some exists to control the flow of information to the masses)<br/>
In the 60&#39;s the counterculture movement started organically (though it was subverted for nefarious means by deep state entities once it began to gain traction)<br/>
Humans of different races are similar enough that they entirely have the potential to live together (though when different cultures have been brainwashed en mass to believe fundamentally opposing ideas this doesn&#39;t work)<br/>
Miscegenation is natural/normal generally.<br/>
Men and women are similar enough that they entirely have the potential to study and work together in mixed environments (though this doesn&#39;t work well in certain scenarios/areas of study and labour where one sex clearly has a natural advantage at the task at hand than the other)<br/>
Sexual promiscuity is normal, generally speaking, and can be beneficial in relevant scenarios.<br/>
General access to medical centres dedicated to aborting pregnancies can be beneficial to society when applied relevantly and with relevant education on the topic to go alongside it.<br/>
Homosexuality is normal/natural and is generally caused by biology.<br/>
Homosexuals generally live similar lives and have similar health outcomes to non-homosexuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you&#39;re misrepresenting what I&#39;m saying there by claiming &quot;you believe everything on the list&quot;, because that&#39;s wrong. Don&#39;t try that.<br/>
I see where they&#39;re coming from, but I do not believe everything on the list as it is written. I do not believe anything on that list is absolute truth. I see them as distorted versions of aspects of truth through the lense of limited human perspective. They may have merit within their own rights, but reality is infinite and complex. I can obviously generalise given that most relate to the human experience, and within a certain time and space.. but time, space, and the human experience change. I know that these perspectives of mine in regards to everything on the list will then, too, change over time, as the circumstances and environments in which each thing on the list refers to changes, respectively.<br/>
You&#39;ve gotta be joking if you want me to go source every single one of my opinions and perspectives. I not going to do that. Are you a robot who requires a solid source on anything to even consider it as a possibility? Or are you human? Did you go to school? Use your own intuition and analysis against everything you&#39;ve learned and further seek out the information yourself to come to understandings on each point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes!! And if you follow that thought all the way down the road and start researching local area cemeteries and grave markers the situation grows highly interesting.... (ex. 1 name (highly unusual and same birth and death years) has a grave marker in 6 towns in area. There are TONS of these. If you go through and assume every one of those grave markers if also elsewhere it more than halves the # of deceased and does make u ask- why the fabrication and lying? </p>

<p>How many generations REALLY came before us?</p>

<p>Edit- I know people can have markers in more than one place. What I’m saying is this is almost common practice and also a ton of high strangeness with this stuff would take a book to explain but if you’re wondering about anything —- look into it! You never know what you’ll find!! 
Ps. Why are there no “John the IV” or “William the XI” now? Shouldn’t there be SOME families that kept naming boys down the line?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really much to say. It&#39;s speculative, just kind of like asking, &quot;If you don&#39;t see something first hand ....how do you know it happened?&quot; Like if I was told that I am related to Cleopatra. Was that a story that my GGGG grandma was told somehow and just passed on but it was bs and really she was the 1st seed of humans here? I mean, it&#39;s not impossible, it is just weird to imagine.</p>

<p>As for the graves thing- findagrave.com and other grave sites, and then graves I have checked in real life at local small cemeteries in PA and NY will have a name like: Bruno Q. McWerndster 1723-1802 (I made that up lol) but that weird- and then you check other states graves and you&#39;ll see this:</p>

<p>Bruno Q. McWerndster 1723 -1800
B.....Q...McW....... 1722 - 1801
B......Q..McW.....1723 -1803
B....Q...McW....1723-1802</p>

<p>And on and on and it&#39;s like... clearly there weren&#39;t that many of that name AND for all to be born within a few years and die with a few years? No. It&#39;s not just poor record keeping because there are tons of them. </p>

<p>Just cruise around websites that show old obituaries and grave markers but instead of thinking that it&#39;s all true, and wearing a &quot;trust everything&quot; cap on, put on your &quot;hmmm I am skeptical&quot; cap. Everything takes on a new tone.</p>

<p>this was actually so interesting to learn. especially after being taught in school that pyramids in Egypt only have 4 sides. how could there be such a huge oversight?</p>

<p>Check out Graham Hancocks documentary and lectures in regards to those exact sites (Easter Island Teotihuacan, Nazca, Angkor Wat and more) and how they align to star/constellations and other celestial landmarks from 10,500 BC (~12,500 years ago).  It&#39;s quite amazing.  </p>

In the earliest periods of Egyptian history, they were able to create literally impossible vases (which the later period of Egyptian history could never replicate, kind of like the Great Pyramids).  Carved dolomite, granite and other extremely tough and difficult-to-carve rocks to make gorgeous curves and lips that are incredible.  There were many &quot;OOPart&quot;s (Out-of-place Artifacts) throughout the Louvre that pulled my attention.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it has something to do with &quot;Ley Lines&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;Ley lines are hypothetical alignments of a number of places of geographical interest, such as ancient monuments and megaliths. Their existence was suggested in 1921 by the amateur archaeologist Alfred Watkins, whose book &#39;The Old Straight Track&#39; brought the alignments to the attention of the wider public&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/leylines.htm">http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/leylines.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The clear link between megaliths and astronomy can also be said for megaliths and ley-lines, as they are often found to be prime ley-markers, and intersections of several ley-lines (i.e., Arbor-Low, Avebury, Stonehenge etc).</p>

<p>One of the largest Leys in England, the so-called St. Michaels Ley, is aligned along the path of  the sun on the 8th of May (The spring festival of St. Michael) and can therefore be considered astronomical.</p>

<p>early megalithic builders were aware of both astronomy and geometry, and combined them deliberately into their constructions. At the same time as this reasonable astonishing revelation, we are able to see how many ley-markers may have been introduced along pre-existing alignments, and it is important to know the origin of all the markers on  ley in order to accurately determine its origin and purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this, I&#39;ll be watching tonight! I&#39;ve always wondered if humans went back further than we&#39;ve been told. Like if something crazy happened and we were all wiped out and tens of thousands of years later someone dug up a cd or flash drive, what the hell would they think it is? I don&#39;t think we really know what the pyramids are or were. I&#39;ve seen a few Joe Rogan podcasts with Graham Hancock, which are super interesting to me, and he&#39;s pretty clear that there are only a handful of Egyptian scholars who pretty much refuse to consider any other theory than the one they&#39;ve endorsed. In any case this is a super fascinating subject to me, so again thank you!</p>

<p>When they divided the height/width of a block, as measured using fucking <strong>metric measurements</strong>, I just turned the damn thing off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this documentary &quot;la révélation des pyramides&quot; have been one of the best on the subject BUT, Jacques Grimeau the man who made it, has stated that this documentary was the first part of a bigger one who will reveal MORE things. But to have this second part he started calling for money and some of the &quot;statements&quot; he told us were false.
No shilling here, just a french guy who&#39;se interested in pyrimds and has been following this documentary since the beginning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just under 26,000 years.  25,900 is what I see most often.</p>

<p>Spez:  the bigger cataclysms happen at the begin/end point, and the middle point.  These are marked on the Great Pyramid by the fixed stars in Aquarius and Leo (begin/end), and Scorpio and Sag (at around 12,900 years later) as shown in the video.  The Younger Dryas was the most recent, and it happened about 12,500 years ago as the Sphinx clock ticked into Sag (I think).  We juuuuust went past the Aquarius marker in Aug, marking a beginning point for the 25,900 year cycle... and in theory jacking up the likelihood of cataclysm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too think there is a correlation between Planet X/Nibiru and cataclysms here on Earth.  Perhaps that celestial body is what causes the magnetic pole flips, etc., and that happens to be when the Sphinx calendar enters/exits these cross-points.  We mark the procession of the Equinox, but that itself merely marks the Planet Xs transit/orbit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great summation, and an even better primer for the newly curious.  A few questions for those beyond primer:</p>

<p>How do these megaliths align with ley lines?</p>

<p>What is the point on earth directly opposite Giza?  Per my analog globe, it&#39;s in the South Pacific.</p>

<p>Why is the &quot;Equator of Megaliths&quot; different than the earth&#39;s equator?  Is there something to the 30-degree angle?  Are we 30-degrees off the galactic equator?</p>

<p>Would continental drift account mess this up over time?  </p>

<p>Easter Island is the outlier here, a tiny speck of land as remote as possible.  Did the builders get lucky there was a landmass in the Pacific along the Equator of Megaliths?  If there was no Easter Island, would they have skipped the Pacific all together or shifted their Equator?</p>

<p>I know a lot of that can only be theorized.</p>

<p>Do the megaliths align with specific celestial bodies in some sort of 2d earth-map of 3d space?  ie:  is Nazca underneath, say, Venus, at any specific time?  </p>

<p>My thinking here is the Equator of Megaliths runs through a lot of ocean that maybe wasn&#39;t ocean back then.  If the known sites align with known stars/planets, then unknown sites may align with other known stars/planets.  Like, say, in the middle of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Spez:  this is not meant to be a Q-like format.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I buried my true question in a wall of text.</p>

<p>Do the megalith sites align with stars or planets?</p>

<p>The Giza complex mirrors the Sirius star system... but so does Teochican (spelling, yea).  Does perhaps the Nazca lines mirror a different celestial system?</p>

<p>If so, celestial systems may point to submerged megaliths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing stuff.  The big implications at the end resonate with a lot of scenarios described by myths, ancient sites and religions (as stated in the documentary).  The Great Year is such an important ingredient to add to your mind stew.  A ~26,000 year cycle based on celestial alignments that civilizations across time and space pointed out/made important.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not some thing one should gloss over so easily.  The cycle is said to be broken up in multiple sections - many saying it lasts 24,000 years, other&#39;s 26,000, and even more precisely, 25,800 years.  It is also divided in half giving ~ 12,650&#39;sh years.  The ancient sites in many of these videos (Pyramids, Angkor Wat etc) relate to the stars as they were at 10,500 BC (~12,500&#39;sh years ago).  It is my belief that these sites were (as said in the movie) are warnings across time and space to tell us of cyclical forces that will come.  We are very near to these times as is stated.  I know some dislike Sitching, but one of his last works, &quot;The End of Days&quot; has some fantastic bits about what others calculated the end of this Great Year cycle was.  </p>

<p>I love the inclusion of the magnetic north pole in this movie, totally opens up so many thoughts.</p>
