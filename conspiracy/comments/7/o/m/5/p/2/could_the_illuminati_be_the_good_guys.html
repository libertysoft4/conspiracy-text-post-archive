<p>Could the demonization of such a society in itself be a conspiracy to smear its name and ideals? Given the fact that it&#39;s almost become a household name shrouded in malevolence, would such a propaganda campaign not be considered incredibly successful? </p>

<p>Even if Luciferian, have we maybe all been raised to think Luficer is the bad guy, when in actuality those ideals are what lead to true freedom?</p>

<p>Could a borderless NWO with one language, one currency, and in essence one united people not be a utopia rather than a totaliterian nightmare? I mean, on paper it sounds better than what we have now </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Luciferianism has a couple different ways of being practiced I believe. As far as I know you are correct about the group which does not actually worship Satan but instead most seem to be atheists using the luceferianism name as a way to piss off/scare christians. I&#39;m obviously biased as a Christian but I believe their pseudo-religion can do no good if they act in the name of lucifer. That&#39;s the antithesis of anything which is good for the mind and soul.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though there are differences between Luciferianism and Laveyan Satanism, they are really only surface differences from what I have come to understand. Luciferianism believes in Lucifer as described in the Bible, but still choose to worship him as they believe he is worthy of worship and a &quot;friend&quot; of mankind. Laveyan Satanism is ostensibly &quot;non religious&quot; in that they claim that neither Satan nor God exists, but when you read the questionnaire that needs to be filled out for entry to the church, that doesn&#39;t seem exactly truthful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But once again, Lucifer represents enlightenment and self-rule, he is the light bringer after all. </p>

<p>That is completely at odds with the idea that have been drilled into all of us for thousands of years: God is good and all-powerful, obey the dogma or suffer for eternity. </p>

<p>Maybe demonizing (lol) Luciferian ideals is the biggest conspiracy of the age and the greatest surpression of the human spirit.</p>

<p>Remember, the church was the one pushing the idea the idea that Lucifer is the embodiment of evil.</p>

<p>Absolutely, but what if they actually aren&#39;t true Illuminati and their actions being tied to the group are simply to further scapegoat the society? It just seems like a few elite controlling the world is the exact opposite of what the illuminati stands for. </p>

<p>On the flipside, I can definitely buy into the idea of infiltration and the fact that the power of a once-noble society would be manipulated to serve a few individuals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t just one way to illuminate it&#39;s easier to go the negitive route. Lucifer is the light bringer and Is a part of every person the light is filtered through the ego and ends up being Satan in pretty much everyone it is a tempter but in doing so is a teacher. The &quot;Illuminat1&quot; is actually doing us a favor in a way by showing you your desires it&#39;s us that choose to feed them. The serpent tempted Eve but she choose to eat. We have to raise a serpent on a brass Pole as Moses said to free us from suffering. The symbols are right in front of us. The modern medical symbols true meaning, The caduces of hermes, Kundalini, mercury, the fire of the pentacost,these people telling you otherwise are speaking from ignorance no offense.

    <div class="md"><p>There are many different groups, they work like nation states. Remember that these secret groups are ALL engaged in one criminal activity or another, that&#39;s how they try to get one over on the other&#39;s.</p>

<p>Take the oath, or take the plunge (again, no less). Your choice, bruv. </p>
