        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am going to give you everything I have collected up to this point. I am doing this because I think we are at a breaking point and after 2018 a lot of this information will be irrelevant. I am also doing this because I believe an conspiratorial brain is a unhealthy brain, I have spent a lot of time collecting this information, since I was 10 in fact (I am 23 now). I see a lot of people on here chasing ridiculous theories and rabbit holes that will take a great deal of your time only to find out its bullshit. I believe this time line is accurate so I will know lay out what I believe as my commitment to this topic has to cease in 2018. I should probably start with why I started falling down the rabbit hole in the first place. </p>

<p>I was raised in the UK, white, middle class and innocent. The countryside was home and the city was big and scary. I went to a primary school with classes of 20 students max and an overall student total of about 150.
I was in year 4 (age 9-10) when my teacher told me to go to the library and pick out a book. Any book at all. Embracing this little glint of freedom in a otherwise regimented schedule I hopped off to the library. There was a company I was familiar with at the time called Dorling Kingsley who made books for beginner readers that went up in colour coded levels. 
I always enjoyed these books because they held your hand slightly but as you got better at reading they backed off more and more letting your natural inquisition take over. So I started browsing and managed to find DK Eyewitness: Invaders from Outer Space. </p>

<p><a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51s-sM1Y6%2BL.jpg">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51s-sM1Y6%2BL.jpg</a>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/25GcL">https://imgur.com/a/25GcL</a></p>

<p>At the time I thought nothing of this book other than intrigue. It didn’t strike me as odd that this material was presented to me in the same as the history, science and mathematics books were. To be honest I’d never questioned anything in life before so why start now as a nine year old. I grabbed the book and read it cover to cover. It was a collection of famous cases and sightings(Roswell, Betty and Barney Hill ect) laid out in a easy to read fashion with helpful fact files on different types of craft (disk, cigar shaped ect triangles not mentioned interestingly) and creatures (grays, elves, nordics and one mention of a single legged metal alien with trunks for arms seen in Brazil I can’t find any mention of anywhere). I’m not claiming I was running around at aged 10 telling all my class mates about greys and flying saucers but along with repeated listens of a song called “Aliens Exist” (by a certain pop punk group I’m not going to name at risk of triggering this entire thread) I had these materials in my brain. </p>

<p>Around about the same time the Internet was really starting to blossom. No centralised social networks trying to box anyone in with labels just a multitude of badly but together websites with piles of information. A true digital Wild West. I was discovering all the pros and cons of anonymous internet. Flash animation, eBaums world and the black vault had teenage me excited, scared but inquisitive. </p>

<p><a href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/21/1371814971187/The-Roswell-Incident-001.jpg">http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/21/1371814971187/The-Roswell-Incident-001.jpg</a></p>

<p>I remember the first time I saw the above picture. I was in a friends brothers bedroom and had been browsing the web doing all of the above and then boom. I remember the fear run through my body. Outside of the cinema I had never seen anything this scary. I will never forgot seeing it. At this point in time I highly doubt the legitimacy of the image but at the time it shat me up no end. Again after a couple of days I moved on and forgot all about Roswell and the cadaver lying on the cold metal table but the seed was there growing slowly in my brain. 
I was well into my teens now and the anti bush movement had been made well aware to me through different forms of media (family guy, the simpsons, green day, american idiot ect), I did not know what the man had done and I did not understand politics for the life of me but I knew everyone fucking hated him. For 3-5 years or so I went on with my life rarely questioning anything to do with this topic. I had no reason to. Everything seemed to be normal and make sense. I had fallen out of touch with Tom Delonge after he has left blink. It seemed he was trying so hard to be/say something but at the same time as saying nothing. As a fan it was infuriating. Mark and Travis had +44 which was much more straightforward and reminiscent of blink. I pretty much agreed with this interview at the time.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060901221936/http://www.b182.com/askmark1.php">http://web.archive.org/web/20060901221936/http://www.b182.com/askmark1.php</a></p>

<p>At this point you are probably wondering why I am telling you all of this and not just posting a link to a unsourced article about a pizza shop in DC that is the headquarters of a international child trafficking ring. Well I feel that the reason my narrative needs to be laid out is that in this topic it is incredibly easy for people to take one look at a man like Steven Greer or Tom Delonge and think they have been brainwashed or are stupid for believing what they are being told. These guys didn&#39;t just hit the black vault, saw a picture of a disc and starting preaching, from what I can gather they have spent the best part of their lives trying to put puzzle pieces together only to be ridiculed by the entire community. I am trying to avoid this by laying out the logic steps I have taken in my research and in doing this as a community we can stop throwing every but of information no matter how ludicrous or fact based. 
Something I have witnessed that I believe is relevant to what is currently happening is Tom Delonge&#39;s progression through different businesses. He started his first company just as blink&#39;s breakthrough album Enema of the State came out. It was a company called Loserkids and specialised in skate and music clothing.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020726013200/loserkids.com">https://web.archive.org/web/20020726013200/loserkids.com</a></p>

<p>He set this up with Mark Hoppus, his bandmate from Blink. Alongside Loserkids they both set up two clothing companies called Atticus and Macbeth respectively. As a fan you were aware of all of these companies because at any opportunity the band were covered in different items from each company. When blink split in 2005 Mark sold all his shares of the companies so they were left entirely to Tom. This is important to mention because it is the beginning of Tom&#39;s journey to To The Stars began. As he conceptualised his new band Angels and Airwaves he noticed that the music industry was changing in a drastic way. As I mentioned earlier the internet was blossoming in a big way and this was a big factor for the music industry. I am sure a lot of us on here have fond memories of this screen ( <a href="https://i.imgur.com/7W1SWdO.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/7W1SWdO.jpg</a> ). Along with iTunes and iPod&#39;s the music industry manifesto of men in suits giving massive advances, TRL and cocaine had burst and the consumer was taking what they thought was theirs for free. Tom had noticed this too and had began to build a platform called Modlife. I guess he thought the reason consumers were taking what they wanted was that they did not feel a personal connection with the artist and therefore had no problem stealing from them. With Modlife he planned to bring live streams, podcasts, chat rooms and exclusive releasers to the consumer, things we all now take for granted. Back in 2006 this was quite exciting to hear and although I did not care for Tom&#39;s new music I alway bared in mind what he was attempting. </p>

<p>I did not properly &quot;wake up&quot; until 2014 but the first thing that really got me thinking was the Zeitgeist documentaries. It question religion, 9/11 and the financial system. The idea of all the religions being correct and based upon one another appealed to me and once I was made aware of tower 7 I was sold. this led to many arguments over the dinner table with my farther who was of the mindset that to question the narrative was to be disrespectful. His disdain of my research only spurred me on. I started to look into the idea of the 5th dimension which began to ease in the idea of what a mind is capable of.  In 2009 Tom got back together with Blink which in turn renewed my interest in his actives. I noticed he has a new range of guitars and each one had a freemason symbol on it. This led me to look into what a freemason was and what the publics perception was regarding them. But it did not distract me from the fact my favourite band was back. Tom was singing and acting like he just did not want to be there. He was carrying on Angels and Airwaves alongside Blink which was a point of contention from day one. One thing that did interest me was a new website he had built using Modlife, Strange Times. It was a collection of stories from fringe topics, it sold merch related to the topics and seemed harmless. Although I had not enjoyed Tom&#39;s music I was very interested in this new endeavour so I kept an eye on it. I actually ended up meeting Tom and was wearing a Strange times shirt at the time which he picked me out of a crowd and commented on the shirt, it was raining and he told me to go inside, get dry, get some pussy. 
Strange Times disappeared from the Web and this brings us to the beginning of where we are now. A american relative had made me aware of Coast to Coast and just by coincidence Tom was scheduled to be on for the first time just a month after I got back from the US.
From here I was introduced to the Phoenix Lights, Skunkworks, the idea the phenomena is inter dimensional, Jacques&#39;s Vallee and a lot more, basically brought me up to speed of where the average redditor on r/conspiracy is now. These interviews interested me but I still held off committing to crazy Tom and his new agenda. I was angry. I missed Blink, it was not the same and could not understand why he was doing what he was doing. Mind you this was before the first book had even come out in 2016 so no one was really paying attention to what he was doing as he had not left blink again yet. I did not buy Sekret Machoines Vol 1 until the November of 2016. I just could not get down with tom not doing blink and following aliens. I had a holiday booked for Jan 2017 and needed a read for the journey and thought fine, I will give it a shot. </p>

<p>2017 I spent collecting data to convince everyone around me I had not lost my fucking marbles. I think after 2018 no one will need convincing. I am presenting it all to you now, please read, look and listen. Please follows things that intrigue you. Please live your life and do not let this consume you. Fuck all the smoke and mirrors of right now. You will have forgot the headlines next week. Look back, find new things.</p>

<p>Biggest Media Outlets Speak What Truth They Can</p>

<p>Follow the money always. Biggest Film maker ever. Steven is the most well known film maker in the world. What a coincidence he manages to tackle UFO&#39;s, paranormal entities, Nazi&#39;s, world government, time travel, inter dimensional science, zero point energies, human connection, friends with Kubrick (realised what Stanley was doing was admirable but not family friendly thats why all spiel bergs films are criticised for being too wholesome and predicable BIG TOPIC easy to swallow), military mentality, holocaust, dinosaurs and overall the nature of humans and how we react to things we do not understand. Look at everything Amblin Entertain meant has ever done. Look at everything Steven has ever attached his name to credited or uncredited. This to me is one of the biggest indications this is all legit.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto V and Call of Duty</p>

<p>GTAV literally portrays the UFO phenomenon as it is. Black craft we made with bad intentions, silver craft they made with all intensions. Also shows craft being underwater.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Nazi Zombies gives you all the keywords you need to research this topic, pair the lore of the game found on the call of duty wiki or the zombies subreddit with the secret machines narrative and you will see that the ambitions hitler had for finding the origins of the human race stemmed from occult research. </p>

I think the public will find in the end he was trying to protect children as he knew about all the actual pedophiles. this case is a smoking gun that something is being held from the public which is what elicited the ridiculous response and backlash.  Michael departed hollywood life to Saudi Arabia for a period of time, watch Joe rogans interview with tom delonge and he talks about Saudi Princes being able to bend spoons with the consciousness, why did Michael go there? Michael is also friends with Spielberg. Gellar says 2018 is the year he can talk about his powers so watch this space)</p>

<p>Roswell was the Nazi&#39;s</p>

<p>This is the narrative that is laid out in Sekret Machines Vol 1 and that Tom has hinted about in his Fade to Black interview linked about and his previous Coast to Coast interviews. The army found out the disk that crashed at Roswell was over Argentinean/German origin. The war was still fresh in the public consciousness so this could never be mown by any one. Government did not care if the public thought it was aliens or a weather balloon. Neither was correct.</p>

Filmed in a Rothchild mansion. Touches on pedo rings, symbology, blackmail, the face one has to put on in public, masks Rumoured final cut hidden from public kubrick&#39;s daughter becomes scientology&#39;s after release. What more can I say…) </p>

<p>American Beauty ( Show&#39;s failures of the system, monogamy, divorce, consumerism, what is socially acceptable, perception. Kevin spacey literally plays self.)</p>

<p>Animaniacs Seasons 1-3 (Direct critique of Hollywood, where everyone takes themselves 100% seriously, talks about abstract world views and science) </p>

<p>Futurama (Show&#39;s why our millennial lifestyle is holding us back from the possibilities that science has to offer)</p>

<p>The Simpsons (Direct mirror of a typical american family, over exaggerates certain situations based on writers assumption of a situation, this leads to some predictions coming true)</p>

<p>Mullholland Drive (Whilst things can seem quite odd at times everything is perception which is a false reality) </p>

<p>Twin Peaks seasons 1-3 + films (VERY IMPORTANT, Lynch practices Trandesental Meditation. First looks like a cute sitcom/crime drama. Litterally documents the CIA&#39;s handling of the UFO phenomenon and the inter dimensional/consciousness connection, this series can be connected to everything on this list and <em>SPOILERS</em> and the episode in the third series regarding atomic bombs literally explains how we stumbled across the world beyond our own)</p>

<p>Indiana Jones (Ark of the Covenent, Amber Room, Nazi holds)</p>

<p>All Star Wars Films (First order literally based on operation paperclip and officers that dodged the american sweep.

TOO MUCH SPIRITUAL MUMBO JUMO ;)</p>

<p>Twelve Monkeys (Again shows how public perception can wrongly incarcerate people the opinion of the zeitgeist can change at the drop of a hat)</p>

<p>Jim &amp; Andy (One of the worlds most successful actor literally channels deceased actor to reprise roll in autobiographical film, footage not released because public do not believe spiritual abilities and thinks actor is being disrespectful and rude)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, you&#39;re clearly passionate about this. There&#39;s less traffic on weekends, so that&#39;s likely why the discussion didn&#39;t take off immediately.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say so. </p>

<p>Whenever subjects like mysticism or &quot;Gnosticism&quot; go invoked, it&#39;s no more than falsehoods, misconceptions, and disinformation that soars with upvotes. I&#39;m convinced that r/Conspiracy only exists to muddle, divide, and discredit any and all conspiracy theories, along with any valid investigations into human mythology and history, ala the Nephilim or Giants (who were not 100 feet tall, but &quot;purified&quot; in a Soma ritual). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the sources, I will definitely save this post so I can peruse your book list. I was expecting to see Black Mirror on this list - have you seen it? It&#39;s a Netflix series and I believe the larger themes we should be taking to heart...</p>

<p>I was a big Blink fan as a kid (we must be around the same age) +44 was good, never did care for A&amp;A. As a young teen I always saw him as a &quot;Jackass&quot; type character, not a serious scholar. There are many who call him a government shill or a state actor. What do you have to say about those claims? He is working with some big-name donors for his project. This makes me think twice about believing anything he does or says. I&#39;ll give your sources a look when I have time to dig deeper. Kudos!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grouped him in with the jackass type for years but being loosely aware of his attempts at amalgamating business strategies for releasing music and other media content and his passion for ufology has led me to believe he has just consilidated his hobby into his professional life, along with the need for a new space age it makes sense this is happening. When people talk about him being used I agree to an extent that the UFO topic is something the needs a controlled release. Like say we were a slave race to a reptilian race, if the announced that on the 6 o clock news people would be fucking blasting their ass everywhere. A strategy of sorts is needed and i think delonge is not the only card at play here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geller was a proven faker. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you what man I&#39;m 30 years old and when I was your age I spent as much time researching these same topics.</p>

<p>I kinda believed it then, however after years and years and more information I&#39;ve come to realize non of it is proof, and I even significantly doubt UFO&#39;s are ET.</p>

<p>There&#39;s really no evidence. </p>

<p>Unless you think the same evidence for fairies, vampires, spirits, ghosts, jinns, leprechauns, etc is convincing for ET and UFO too. </p>

<p>The government/cia was scammed into investigating remote viewing, just as how MIT was initially tricked into thinking Geller had abilities. </p>

<p>What that forray revealed is that the capacity for humans to design objective tests is always slightly bested by the ability to bypass them. </p>

<p>The recent Pentagon program was also almost certainly a clever scam by Bigelow...Who&#39;s been involved in trying to monetize &quot;phenomena&quot; for years. Look up fake industries or fake businesses like Solyndra, Tesla, etc. </p>

<p>The idea is you trick the government into funding a program or a business. </p>

<p>The nazi ufo stuff was just a dude trying to sell books</p>

<p>The rest of the UFO phenomena is some combination of that, paranoia, the same thing that accounts for werwolfs, angels, ghosts, etc through the ages and rare aerial phenomena. Look up the UK/ MOD Unidentified Aerial Phenomena report and it&#39;s Annex. You&#39;ll be amazed at all super rare atmospheric phenomena that can account for UFO sightings.</p>

<p>It should explain how the increase in dust / exhaust fumes from the bombings over Europe would lead to the foo fighter sightings by Air crews.</p>

<p>Not to mention how it wasn&#39;t until the 40&#39;s that people in general had a reason to look into the sky&#39;s for objects and hence the corresponding increase in &#39;UFO&#39; sightings... Along with paranoia, psychological/social/military type experiments, and or military industrial complex faking it for more funding... </p>

<p>Or it was purposely encouraged... You never mentioned the documentary on Netflix about how the government put out fake ufo info as cover for projects and to mess with people...</p>

<p>Either way man I&#39;m still always interested in this subject so if you got a specific link or a specific something that you think is the best evidence let me know... I looked through as many of yours as possible but didn&#39;t come across anything new or substantial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The summarian tablets/seals and myth are kinda interesting and convincing at first glance...however it might just be a coincidence on a tablet or two. Just because the sky had 10 objects in it or whstever doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the sun and planets.  I&#39;ve only seen one presentation at a UFO conference about it and tbh I&#39;ve been meaning to verify it / look into it more.</p>

<p>The tribe in Africa that &#39;apparently&#39; knew of Cirius 9 or whatever... The star you can only see with a telescope so the question is how do they know...they even said a visitor told them... Well turns out there was a European explorer interested in astronomy that came through there at the turn of the century or whstever and he told them about it.</p>

<p>As for Brian Forester or whatever his name is... The guy who does the hidden Inca tours and talks about ancient aliens, etc... Their argument basically settles to &#39;this stone work is too nice &#39; but when you realize the stone work isn&#39;t too nice it&#39;s just very nice and completely possible it&#39;s like so what...</p>

<p>The star child skull... Debunked as a genetic diseased child... All those sculls in Peru and stuff that those crazy religious people think are pre flood nephilim or fall angels / giants or whatever are just the result of board binding / skull binding or genetic disease.
Crystal skulls was a big thing 20 years ago but that&#39;s been debunked too. Just more people trying to sell books, tours or guilty of fantastical thinking. </p>

<p>Pretty much any of the stuff you look into when you get down to the facts it is never convincing. </p>

<p>The sad thing is I keep looking, hoping for something lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean there is a list of about 25 films and 25 books a recommend reading if you want to understand my point. That’s my whole point. It’s not as cut and dry as people assume. I think there’s a massive part of life people are not acknowledging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t summarize it at all. All you did was post about a bunch of movies about aliens and nazis and implied they&#39;re trying to say something, but you can&#39;t seem to discern what that is, and people here are eating it up like sheep because it fits into their narrative, but it only does that because you didn&#39;t offer any actual conclusions. If you can&#39;t succinctly explain your findinga, you don&#39;t understand them yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am amazed....I am in US from Oregon but now live in AZ. White was raised pretty innocent and a product of the 60s and 70s&#39;. I actually did not even start to really notice the world until I got sober in 89&#39;. Since then I have been running to catch up. I wish I would have tried to figure this out sooner. Kudos to a job well done. I am with you now.</p>

<p>Whenever subjects like mysticism or &quot;Gnosticism&quot; go invoked, it&#39;s no more than falsehoods, misconceptions, and disinformation that soars with upvotes. I&#39;m convinced that r/Conspiracy only exists to muddle, divide, and discredit any and all conspiracy theories, along with any valid investigations into human mythology and history, ala the Nephilim or Giants (who were not 100 feet tall, but &quot;purified&quot; in a Soma ritual). </p>
