    <div class="md"><p>So it sounds like he didnt predict shit. Like OP said, seems like there was some vague connections. And the fire was in a secret service facility, not like it was Hillary&#39;s room. </p>

<p>The day before David Rockefeller died, I said, on this sub, on this account something along the lines of &quot;that old fuck just wont die&quot;. Did I predict his death or get lucky?</p>

<p>He said &quot;We will however light a FIRE to flush them out&quot; </p>

<p>As in someone else setting a fire to flush someone else out of their home.</p>

<p>As in specifically implying it was going to be a fire started elsewhere forcing her out of doors.</p>

<p>&quot;I said, on this sub, on this account something along the lines of &quot;that old fuck just wont die&quot;. Did I predict his death or get lucky?&quot;</p>

<p>How do you not know? Do you often get leaks the day before about future deaths and publish them online and then have amnesia? </p>

<p>If you said &quot;I&#39;m kickedinthedick, I&#39;m gonna be here for a few years and nearly everything I say is going to happen. Tomorrow Rockafeller dies&quot; and then he died you&#39;d gain a following right away, 100% certain.</p>

<p>If you made it vague as fuck and said &quot;Old crow D.R. FLIES tomorrow&quot; you&#39;d still probably gain a following of some people thinking you predicted it.</p>

<p>If you said &quot;RKFLR DOA2MRW&quot; and spammed a bunch of threads with just that and then David Rockafeller died the next day you&#39;d still get a following.</p>

<p>It would go on until people stopped reading the headlines and thinking &quot;Oh kinda like that cryptogram from KickedInTheDick yesterday&quot; so all you would have to do would be to stop cryptically predicting events with a strange accuracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is not even remotely involved for starters. No idea how you got the word Trump in your mouth there.</p>

<p>It gave investigators access to their house 1 day before 2 of Hilarys FBI investigations officially began. Hilary and Bill could not have been allowed back on their property until it was certain that all buildings were up to firecode giving the government control of their house for a day.</p>

<p>This means FBI investigators got a slight head start. Has nothing to do with Trump and it really seems like you&#39;re just a troll.</p>

<p>Anyways, even if Hillary is evil, isnt it kind of mean to set her house on fire to flush her out? And whats the advantage of her leaving her house for a couple hours?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Dont use the word &quot;specific&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes Master.</p>

<p>&quot;There was nothing specific about this&quot;</p>

<p>You said it not me, yes there was. A fire was lit and Hilarry and Bill were flushed out of their home.</p>

<p>&quot;Anyways, even if Hillary is evil, isnt it kind of mean to set her house on fire to flush her out?&quot;</p>

<p>Hillary and Bill were barred from the house all day, 2 investigations were set to start the following day so the investigators potentially had time to get evidence that hadn&#39;t been destroyed yet using the fire as a certain way to gain access to the house before Bill and Hilary were expecting anyone.</p>

That said I personally don&#39;t know what the Q thing is about but their praise of Trump concerns me, I&#39;m not trying to be inflammatory, but there&#39;s a good chance he cannot read over a 5th grade level and his ghost writer who wrote Art of Dealzeolio explicitly said that he couldn&#39;t get the dult  to focus on the interview for longer than 15 minutes at a time.
He also said he regrets writing it  It pained Trump as an intellectual in any of his supporters minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q may or may not be bullshit, but it&#39;s apparent you don&#39;t understand what Q is.  It&#39;s not a prediction.  It&#39;s not a magic 8 ball.   It&#39;s a way of dissecting an issue.  A way of showing you the general landscape and a sort of lexicon to understand so that you can make your own conclusions to what is going on.  Can it be a bit leading?  Sure.  But this guy&#39;s just saying what he believes in, same as anyone else who has a YouTube channel.  What are you interested in?  Anyone can do it, right, but where are you going with your questions?   Where is the remote and who the fuck keeps shitting without flushing are very important questions, but only important to you, and anyone who might want to take a shit or watch TV.</p>

<p>I would challenge you try it with a &quot;conspiracy&quot; that interests you.<br/>
For instance with 9/11:
Who owned the buildings?
Who made money off the insurance?
How does a plane&#39;s nose cone make it fully intact when crashing through a building?
Can a plane&#39;s nose cone remain intact after crashing through a building to the other side?
Who was in the building that day?
What government offices were in the building that day?
What affiliation did the terrorists have?
etc etc.</p>

<p>If you can make one that actually illicits a genuine curiosity in people, like hey, &quot;Who DID own the buildings, I wanna know!&quot;, then you&#39;re on your way to being Q.  Isn&#39;t that why we&#39;re in this sub?  To possibly learn the truth, or for others to spread what they think is the truth?  Is it going to have your OWN spin?  Your OWN theories and viewpoint?  Of course it will.   How could it not? </p>

<p>The people who blindly believe everything they see from Q (or more accurately, what they see other people&#39;s interpretations of what Q might have meant), that might be what you&#39;re actually annoyed with.  </p>

<p>Personally I&#39;m enjoying the show, especially that first week he started posting, just wow it was quite literally the best form of entertainment I&#39;ve probably ever experienced.   I was on the edge of my seat!   Maybe Q is bullshit, maybe not.  I&#39;m not here to challenge you on that one way or the other.  If it&#39;s a LARP, hands down best LARP ever, and I&#39;m a fan.  If not a LARP.  Well.  I&#39;m sure you know.</p>

<p>The questions you&#39;ve posed are mockeries so of course they sound ridiculous. But there are other questions that can be asked that don&#39;t sound so ridiculous, such as, but not limited to:</p>

<p>Who actually colluded with Russia?  </p>

<p>Why were those flight diverted?  </p>

<p>Where is Julian Assange?  </p>

<p>Why such forceful disdain for an anon posing questions about sensitive topics?</p>

<p>WRONG</p>

<p>The USM is practically controlled by the deep state, and essentially sucks it&#39;s throbbing cock at every turn.</p>

<p>Mind you a lot of Soldiers end up becoming &quot;enemies of the state&quot; due to their (depending) knowledge, and work with that agenda.</p>

Im not the kind of conspiracy theorist who believes the world is flat, but after looking into Q&#39;s word choice and timing, I&#39;ve determined it would be impossible to be that accurate that many times without having some inside knowledge.</p>

<p>How do you predict the ATL airport blackout? How do you predict a kid from Bangladesh is going to create &quot;fireworks&quot; in a false flag attack made to look like its from ISIS? How do you say all this shit about Saudi Arabia and only THEN the purge happened? </p>

<p>Its not Nostradamus saying &quot;Two sisters will fall in the west&quot;, and then you being like &quot;Oh its the twin towers&quot; .. its &quot;this is going to happen here at this time or today or this week&quot;, and then said thing happens. and it ALWAYS happens. None of the real Qanon posts have been even slightly off with their connections.</p>

<p>You dont get to say Q is full of shit, when he posts &quot;Blunt and Direct Time&quot;, &quot;enjoy the fireworks&quot; and &quot;False Flag&quot;, then 2 hours later a kid from Bangladesh (BDT is their national currency abbreviation) is in a news for blowing himself up at a train station in NYC, and what looked like fireworks shot out of his backpack hurting no one else only himself, oh and he supported ISIS, lol, like... ya just dont get it do you?</p>
