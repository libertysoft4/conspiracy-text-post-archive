    <div class="md"><p>&quot;IMO this sub is about 50/50 ratio on Trump supporters to non-supporters. Saying half of us are shills basically means you believe everyone you disagree with is shilling.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that how that math works out. If half of each side are shills, he&#39;s likely to agree with the shills that are arguing from &quot;his side.&quot;  So only half the people he disagrees with are shills, the other half are genuine. As such, only half the people that agree with him are genuine, while the other half that agree are shills. Shills work both sides.</p>

<p>&quot;Anecdotally that is how I’ve seen shilling accusations play out here.&quot;</p>

<p>Just cause that&#39;s how the accusations fly doesn&#39;t mean they hit their mark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think you’re disagreeing with what I said—just elaborating on it.  Too often, the level of discourse on this sub stoops to “you’re speaking in support of Trump, must be a Russian shill” or “you’re speaking against Trump, obvious Shariablue Soros shill”</p>

<p>It’s juvenile, and frankly idiotic.   It gives anyone here an easy out to avoid debating from a position of honesty, logic, and evidence and instead summarily discount any position against the opinion they already hold.  </p>

<p>If you believe in something, bring your conviction to r/conspiracy and use your brain to convince us why you’re right.  Don’t just call everyone who disagrees a shill.  There are many decent people here with viewpoints from a variety of sides—very few of them are actually bots or shills.  Make an actual fucking argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Missed that post but it’s pretty self-evident if you come here regularly.  IMO, it makes this a very worthwhile place of discussion.  All of the other major political subs are ban-happy echo chambers too consumed by hatred of the other side to have any sort of fully rational discussion. </p>

<p>If, for instance, you hate Trump but also think Hillary was an awful choice, are liberal in many ways but are a huge 2nd amendment supporter—this sub is by far the best place to talk politics. </p>

<p>You do realise surely that r/politics isn&#39;t particularly ban happy and that the users there only ever grudgingly supported Hillary. The only thing that it&#39;s missing from your list is 2nd amendment support, which it is actually more moderate on in average than you might think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chill dude I was just saying I haven’t seen that study but agree with the premise just based off guesswork. </p>

<p>Check out my other post on this thread to see how fully I agree with how toxic shilll accusations are on here. </p>

<p>As far as r/politics, I agree and give them full credit that they do not ban for dissenting views.  However they also will not upvote or consider them even if polite and well-reasoned.  I strongly disagree about Hillary though—the majority of that sub worships her and views her as a near-perfect candidate with few flaws.  Just try mentioning Bernie and the DNC rigging the primaries and be prepared to be called a Russian shill.  </p>

<p>It may not be the case overall for liberals IRL, but r/politics is also strongly anti-gun.  They stoop to emotional “think of the safety of the kids” arguments and go full nanny-state.  The infamous Hillary tweet about “think of how many more he could have killed if he had a silencer” was hugely supported there, showing complete lack of basic knowledge that consumer suppressors do not silence guns like in James Bond movies.  Again, try to explain that basic fact politely and you will be met with “Sandy hook bro, you are literally Hitler and want 5 year olds to die”</p>

<p>Reddit benefits from having subreddits with homogeneous demographics/interests/etc.  Advertisers pay a premium to reach a targeted audience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absoulutely right. Reddit benifits from us, and we&#39;re supporting their actions through our continued usage and participation. IMO knowing what we do, if they won&#39;t change, continued support is at least a partial of a lapse in moral judgement. The forward-thinking, ethically diciplined choice is to leave completely (though ideally not before writing a post to make you intentions clear widely heard and understood). Besides the sort of inline-advertizing, data-mining and product pushing that <a href="/r/HailCorporate/">/r/HailCorporate/</a> catches on to, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7oykux/eric_weinsteins_4_quadrants_how_disconnects_in/">&quot;First principal thinkers / Contrarians&quot;</a> are also actvely shunned on this site. If those thinking critically just packed up and left, this site would lose all credibility and devolve into CTR/MMFA/ShareBlue echo chamber. Blatant organized astroturfing is allowed, and supported by the admins. Reddit&#39;s an arm of the mainstream media, with deep pockets, and rich connections to the establishment. They should get exactly what they deserve and desire.</p>

<p>The dilemma is that no significant portion of the user base wants to actually pay for a reddit replacement.  Any other &quot;free&quot; reddit replacement will eventually be plagued with the same issues and conflicts.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what happened to Digg.  They sold out hardcore, the site sucked, and everyone migrated to reddit thinking it would be neutral.  A few years and HuffPo acquisition later and we are back at the same spot.</p>

<p>Well I&#39;d say that a significant portion of users <em>have</em> say donated to Voat.co. I get your point though that more funding of could be massively helpul. With how prolific internet crowdfunding is, funding is an entirely solvable issue. You don&#39;t nessisarily need a huge investor nowadays, especially if you get crafty. Some useful reccomendations to heed from the now defunct youtube alternative vidme: <a href="https://medium.com/vidme/goodbye-for-now-120b40becafa">https://medium.com/vidme/goodbye-for-now-120b40becafa</a></p>

<p><strong>Insights for newcomers</strong></p>

<p>If you’re considering building your own video platform, here are a few suggestions:</p>

<p><strong>Monetization </strong>— Plan to operate at a loss for an indefinite period of time, and/or be operated by a deep-pocketed business with multiple revenue streams and touchpoints with consumers. Give users of your existing products incentives to engage with your video platform, and be wary of monetizing with advertisements prior to achieving massive scale.</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure costs </strong>— Explore emerging technologies, such as peer-to-peer storage and delivery to further reduce infrastructure overhead. Consider restrictive storage policies, and own as much of the physical infrastructure as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Audience building</strong> — Leverage an existing audience, and/or incentivize all platform participants by issuing a native currency (e.g. blockchain) to equitably reward contributors.</p>

<p>Capitalization adds emphasis. I want to emphasize <em>Corporate Centrists</em> as a proper noun, and as a proper, defined group of people.

<p>And? Sorry that Corporatists have co-opted both Parties and the entire US political system. It&#39;s a term that <em>must</em> be used to identify the problem. Words have power.

<p>Ah yes, Mueller. The FBI Director during 9/11, them an who is bringing on known partisans to his investigation, people who have worked with both HRC and Obama, and who has had to let some of them go after it came out publicly that they were vehemently anti-Trump.

<p>I&#39;ve been following this story since the beginning. If they honestly had evidence that the President of the US directly colluded with the Russian to steal the election they would never have allowed him to become President. But go ahead and claim &quot;that&#39;s just now how things work&quot; or &quot;due process&quot;.

<p>No, just asking. It&#39;s a weird way to communicate as far as I see it.</p>

<p>He or she thinks I&#39;m saying they are in cahoots with OP here too, but I don&#39;t see the point in that.</p>

<p>Well I&#39;m not making that accusation so I guess it is surprising...</p>

<p>The corporate media shat on near-centrist Bernie (just a little left of center).
The elites are extremely right wing and extremely authoritarian.</p>

<p>They&#39;re NEOliberals (extremely deregulated markets and banks) and NEOconservatives (warmonger foreign policy). Obama/Bush/Clinton are all NEOlibs and NEOcons simultaneously, just different shades of the same
establishment model of corrupt politician.</p>

<p>Lib vs con is just bullshit to keep us psychologically chained to the corporate duopoly, like marketing.
&quot;I&#39;m a proud lib/con, so I&#39;ma vote muh Dems/Repubs&quot;</p>

<p>Dems and Repubs:</p>

<p>Libs and Cons:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally believe the Dems can reform. It has to be a grassroots movement.
Either that or somehow removing the very right wing NEOlibs and replacing them with legit left wingers and centrists. Also removing money from politics would greatly help.</p>

I would imagine people who appreciate TD don&#39;t see an issue, just like Bernie supporters didn&#39;t mind when Bernie spam got real bad.

    <div class="md"><p>Except, how do you, a non-admin, go about proving this claim?</p>

<p>I think its legitimate question given that Reddit maintains a very biased socio political narrative toward the general userbase and makes changes to the algorithms to specific filter out and suppress views the admins disagree with.</p>

<p>Whether or not the sub engaged in such activities is an equally valid question, but the site&#39;s previously documented incidents of suppressing opposing views and silencing dissention should be taken into consideration. Simply throwing out the word brigading and botting on a matter that already caters to a bias you hold simply adds nothing except to further your perceptions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no different than when FPH got shutdown; claims of brigading, botting, harassment, etc were thrown about, but no actual evidence was provided because <em>everyone already assumed it to be true</em> and solely on the merit that certain groups found the sub to be offensive to them, popularizing unfounded and unsubstantiated claims that simply sounded plausible.</p>

<p>I agree with <em>user-initiated</em> filtering; let the user make the choice. That&#39;s a smart decision; you don&#39;t want something on the front page, then it shouldn&#39;t be there for <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>Forcibly changing an algorithm to favor or suppress views is not.</p>

<p>People claimed left and right that there dozens of posts calling for brigading in the FPH and they were right; they just left out the part where the mods shut those posts down because they knew what would happen if they didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Using one of the examples above, if somebody posts the Harvard study in to fluoride on Reddit and states it is proof that governments the world over are deliberately altering my state of mind by putting fluoride in the water I will have a genuine interest in that conspiracy theory. If I then go and read the Harvard study and discover that it is not proof of that at all (it isn&#39;t), then I guess all future posts of a similar ilk will have an element of &quot;shits and giggles&quot; about it for me, yes.</p>

<p>They then analyzed possible associations with IQ measures in more than 8,000 children of school age; all but one study suggested that high fluoride content in water may negatively affect cognitive development.</p>

<p>The average loss in IQ was reported as a standardized weighted mean difference of 0.45, which would be approximately equivalent to seven IQ points for commonly used IQ scores with a standard deviation of 15.*  Some studies suggested that even slightly increased fluoride exposure could be toxic to the brain. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. </p>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While the impacts of these fluoride concentrations in the pineal are not yet fully understood, studies have found that calcified deposits in the pineal are associated with decreased numbers of functioning pinealocytes and reduced melatonin production (Kunz et al., 1999) as well as impairments in the sleep-wake cycle.</p>

<p><a href="http://fluoridealert.org/issues/health/pineal-gland/">http://fluoridealert.org/issues/health/pineal-gland/</a></p>

<p>Then we have:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland#Society_and_culture">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland#Society_and_culture</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seventeenth-century philosopher and scientist René Descartes was highly interested in anatomy and physiology. He discussed the pineal gland both in his first book, the Treatise of Man (written before 1637, but only published posthumously 1662/1664), and in his last book, The Passions of the Soul (1649) and he regarded it as &quot;the principal seat of the soul and the place in which all our thoughts are formed.&quot;[7] In the Treatise of Man, Descartes described conceptual models of man, namely creatures created by God, which consist of two ingredients, a body and a soul.[7][58] In the Passions, Descartes split man up into a body and a soul and emphasized that the soul is joined to the whole body by &quot;a certain very small gland situated in the middle of the brain&#39;s substance and suspended above the passage through which the spirits in the brain&#39;s anterior cavities communicate with those in its posterior cavities&quot;. Descartes attached significance to the gland because he believed it to be the only section of the brain to exist as a single part rather than one-half of a pair. Most of Descartes&#39;s basic anatomical and physiological assumptions were totally mistaken, not only by modern standards, but also in light of what was already known in his time.[7][59]</p>

<p>The notion of a &quot;pineal-eye&quot; is central to the philosophy of the French writer Georges Bataille, which is analyzed at length by literary scholar Denis Hollier in his study Against Architecture. In this work Hollier discusses how Bataille uses the concept of a &quot;pineal-eye&quot; as a reference to a blind-spot in Western rationality, and an organ of excess and delirium.[60] This conceptual device is explicit in his surrealist texts, The Jesuve and The Pineal Eye.[61]</p>

<p>In the late 19th century Madame Blavatsky (who founded theosophy) identified the pineal gland with the Hindu concept of the third eye, or the Ajna chakra. This association is still popular today.[7]</p>

<p>Rick Strassman, an author and Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, has theorised that the human pineal gland is capable of producing the hallucinogen N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) under certain circumstances.[62] In 2013 he and other researchers first reported DMT in the pineal gland microdialysate of rodents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pineal Gland has an ancient history of having a Spiritual purpose, being the seat of the soul, and being responsible for the spiritual development of people for thousands of years now from Indian and Tibetan cultures, as well as Celtic, Christian Mystic, Judaism, and many others.</p>

<p>Studies showing that it lowers IQ, cognitive impairment, and pineal gland calcification have a number of connections to what Conspiracy Theories have been saying is true for decades now. So in actuality, you are wrong</p>

<p>That&#39;s just putting up a straw-man argument, it&#39;s easy to gather a few outlandish stories and then suggest that the entire fruit basket is rotten. People forget that the very same can be said about the mainstream media, most of it are lies and half truths as a form of indoctrination, sources spreading actual information to the people are few and far between.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the entire crux of this discussion, some people believe that they adhere to this moderate and widely accepted source of news when they flick on their TV and read their newspaper, and then treat the crazy bunch who get their ideas on r/conspiracy and alternative sources as gullible fools who&#39;ve lost track of reality. </p>

<p>Truth is that the alternative media is largely a result of the people losing trust in the old media, and to find out what is actually going on in the world, you can no longer stick to watching 30 minutes of evening news, you need to rely on alternative sources, you need to start applying critical thought and figure out what&#39;s going on. Of course, that has its own problems, since critical thought is not really taught in schools it is now somewhat of a lost art, which leads to people falling in traps of outlandish theories. That doesn&#39;t mean you should throw the baby out with the bathwater. If you do not spend a good amount of time reading things outside of the mainstream media, you&#39;re largely oblivious to what&#39;s going on in the world, on the other hand, if you only stick to the fringe, then you&#39;ll lose track of reality just as well.</p>

<p>We talk about stuff before its proven to be true in this sub all the time. When the NSA spying on its citizens came out via Snowden, the posts on the front page of r/all about this topic had many replies saying &quot;I guess the folks at r/conspiracy were right&quot; leading to a flood of new users coming here to check us out.</p>

<p>Same deal with the T_D&#39;ers when they saw how biased the leftist media was, they learned about CIA/Washingtonpost/Amazon Servers connection, Operation Mockingbird, rigged primary, wikileaks dumps, so that also sent a lot of users from there over here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peculiar how things can go from &quot;fringe&quot; to &quot;widely accepted&quot; in the span of a few minutes. Ask yourself what it is that you think is fringe. Perhaps it&#39;s just your assumption of what people think about chemtrails?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s be honest here, &quot;all about the condensation trails&quot; is a pretty vague statement, and so is &quot;warfare simulations&quot;. I mean, where does one end and the other start without applying actual scrutiny to the details? They flew planes across the country for decades and sprayed the population with things that in some cases made them sick. You&#39;ll have to admit that&#39;s a pretty good match for a chemtrail description, so why would you now state that it doesn&#39;t fit the chemtrail story? Perhaps you formed and idea about chemtrails in your head that was so outlandish that it could never be true, to the extend that when you&#39;re faced with evidence, you can&#39;t but disconnect the two.</p>

<p>If you understand how the truth is buried, then you understand why you shouldn&#39;t look at the most outlandish version of a story and then discard the whole topic because it&#39;s too crazy a story for you. There is a very fine line between &quot;fringe&quot; and &quot;widely accepted&quot;, sometimes, it&#39;s just a matter of wrapping up the story in a neatly written article.</p>

<p>Oh and...the very title of this post is whining on behalf of t_d and you say it has nothing to do with t_d.  You talk about finding truth to lies when trump is one of the biggest liars in modern american political history. That is very typical of the complete lack of awareness of your average Trump supporter.</p>

<p>About ruining this sub...i think it is obvious who turned it from talking about cia and ufos and bigfoot-ish stuff into a non stop anti hillary political witchhunt day afyer day. Again, a lack of self awareness propels your thought process</p>

<p>13 users with bots could easily do that.</p>

<p>And what would be the motive for bots upvoting this post?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To keep pushing the idea that t_d is unfairly persecuted, to deligitimize left leaning opinions as brigades instead of people actually expressing opinions.</p>

<p>Logic would back my original assessment, that the brigading started <em>after</em> the thread got traction. Just think about it.</p>

<p>Also, accusing bots of manipulating threads is a really weak line of argument. Do you have any real evidence that T_D users have ever used bots, or is that just you&#39;re own way of justifying things that don&#39;t match your own views?</p>

<p>Where does that excuse end, do you think bots voted Donald Trump into power?</p>

<p>Considering 50% of the country will disapprove of him no matter what he does, those are actually really strong numbers. It just so happens that most of the 50% that will never support him waste all their time on reddit as well.

<p>Surely you see that is true of every President in history. Are you going to tell me that Barack Obama&#39;s low of 38% were some &quot;really strong numbers&quot; because &quot;50% of the country will disapprove of him no matter what&quot; ?</p>

<p>And yes I post regularly on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. I am a left-leaning centrist. I used to post on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> until they banned me after making comments that were negative about Trump&#39;s cabinet choices (largely financial/banking industry guys). So yeah I&#39;m well aware of how dangerous &quot;echo chambers&quot; can be, and feel that way particularly strongly about <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. I&#39;m full aware of how silly <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is, but if <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is silly, <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> is downright scary.</p>

<p>And r/the_donald is definitely an echo chamber, but it doesn&#39;t hide that fact like r/politics does. Just read the rules, it&#39;s literally a fan page for Donald Trump, whereas r/politics pretends like it&#39;s objective even though they ban users for supporting Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>42% is low. The difference is that you&#39;re making excuses for it, and I&#39;m not. Furthermore you&#39;re not seeing the connection between a low approval rating, and uptick in negative commentary and discussion about a candidate. You&#39;re looking for bots and shills when you should be reading polls to better understand what elements of Trump&#39;s behavior have caused the most recent sub-50% numbers.</p>

<p>As for your defense of <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>...it&#39;s not really worth it to go into. If you think echo chambers have ANY place in a critical thinkers life (fan page or otherwise) then it&#39;s a waste of my time to discuss it with you. <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> is not simply a &quot;fan page for Donald Trump&quot; as you state, and I think you know that deep down...otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be drawn to a place like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with other people who spend a lot of time trying to unravel the truth from all the bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been starting to believe that the users of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> share a lot of similarities with users of t_d. Maybe it is wishful thinking, but I just can&#39;t think that the views of these subs are a reflection of of the majority of users on Reddit. I think both subs are mostly comprised of trolls, very young people who don&#39;t fully get it yet, and of course shills/astroturfers. For me it can get really depressing seeing these extremely polarized users knock each other down to new lows in front of us, and that being the biggest voice on Reddit.</p>

<p>What gives me hope(? I guess you could say) is lurking on this sub and seeing the number of subscribers slowly increase by almost a thousand every day. I&#39;ve been keeping track and since about august this sub has increased by at least 90,000. That has to mean at least new people are coming here and willing to get a primer on &quot;waking up&quot; and are getting tired of all the obvious bullshit going on in our mainstream pop culture.</p>

<p>Logic would back my original assessment, that the brigading started <em>after</em> the thread got traction. Just think about it.</p>

<p>Also, accusing bots of manipulating threads is a really weak line of argument. Do you have any real evidence that T_D users have ever used bots, or is that just you&#39;re own way of justifying things that don&#39;t match your own views?</p>

<p>Where does that excuse end, do you think bots voted Donald Trump into power?</p>

<p>Oh and...the very title of this post is whining on behalf of t_d and you say it has nothing to do with t_d.  You talk about finding truth to lies when trump is one of the biggest liars in modern american political history. That is very typical of the complete lack of awareness of your average Trump supporter.</p>

<p>About ruining this sub...i think it is obvious who turned it from talking about cia and ufos and bigfoot-ish stuff into a non stop anti hillary political witchhunt day afyer day. Again, a lack of self awareness propels your thought process</p>
