    <div class="md"><p>Though I tend to agree with your support for the LGBT community, and have myself cautioned people against taking hatred for certain Cabal leaders of Jewish descent from spiraling into hatred for the whole group, I can explain why it&#39;s looked on distrustfully here. It has to do with the family- a lot of people see gay rights, transgenderism, and attacks on traditional masculine and feminine roles as an attack on the Family, and the Family is the absolute most important building block of society. I agree that the Family needs to be defended, I just disagree that allowing gays to marry each other really harms the concept in the end. But many disagree with me, and it&#39;s because to them LGBT rights etc. is an attack on the fundamental building blocks of society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except traditional “masculine” and “feminine” are very Eurocentric ideals and a lot of societies don’t adhere to them and everyone turns out fine. </p>

<p>Also the attack on “family” aspect can be disproven too. I know plenty of straight parents who were awful to their children, neglectful, and abusive and plenty of gay parents who were amazing and gave their children everything they needed. Of course it goes backwards too. The genders of the parents have nothing to do with their ability to raise a family. </p>

<p>And I know you disagree with the hate here, so the statement isn’t towards <em>you</em> specifically, it’s mainly generally for the people who do think that way.</p>

<p>Second, this is a conspiracy sub.  I disagree with more theories I see than I agree with, but for the most part the people who post them are people I rely on as solid sources of information.  I don&#39;t want to speak for anyone but I suspect that most, because they are open to many ideas, are fine with LGBT, or whatever labels ignorami wish to put on people. </p>

<p>Also, while I see some bias against Jewish people in general I consider it ill informed noise.  However, in the same way that I didn&#39;t dislike South Africans in the 1980&#39;s I absolutely despised the apartheid state that people were forced to live under, so if you are picking up an anti-apartheid Israeli state vibe please rest assured the conspiracy isn&#39;t in a religion it is in the suppresion of human beings. </p>

<p>Is the fear justified? Maybe. Maybe not. Depends on the theory itself.</p>

<p>This is, in turn, why there are so many right-leaning individuals interested in conspiracy theories; the American right in particular being a fear-based belief system.</p>

<p>The foundation of the anti-LGBT theories rest on the conceit of “cultural Marxism”, itself a dramatic misinterpretation of the source material you are welcome to google for the phrase. The anti-Jewish (Sorry, anti-Zionist) theories also have this basis.</p>

<p>Add in the oddly large number of religiously-based conspiratorial beliefs; and the oddly religious idea that is an all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful Illuminati conspiracy and you have the perfect conditions for fear of anything not straight white middle class America.</p>

<p>Did I say that?</p>

<p>I make that assumption based on a lot of arguments and interactions with them. Mostly I base the conclusion that a non-zero number are hiding antisemitism with anti-Zionism on how they frame their arguments; it is never “a Zionist faction” or “Zionists in Israel”, it is always “Israel” and “Israeli intelligence” and calling me goy and shit.</p>

<p>There never seems to be any gradient to their arguments differentiating Jews and Zionists <em>except</em> when they get called on it. Like now. <em>Then</em> there is suddenly a total difference and how could I possibly not see that before, etc. </p>

<p>Let me ask you this why is &quot;it not going so great&quot; right now? You can look all you want externally but the answers really lie internally.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to be a victim and but your perception of your world is your reality and only you have the power to change it. So why think of world or this sub or this &quot;masculine macho man&quot; as the Boogeyman out to get you?</p>

<p>We are all searching for the same thing love, peace, and unity. Why create this illusion of separation through your thoughts and actions? Your expectations will eventually become your reality if you believe long enough and have enough energy so why expect hated towards you? What you search for with your thoughts you will eventually find so instead expect and search for acceptance rather than having the &quot;masculine macho man sit down&quot;.</p>

<p>You can choose to see those extremely rare posts as the norm or you can choose to see it for what it is a single person who is misguided. Your choice of how you react to it internally will control how you see things externally. The choice is yours</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, saying things like “transgenders” gives me some potential information already about your level of familiarity with the topic.</p>

<p>Gender dysphoria is the mental illness <em>resulting</em> from the decidedly not mental illness of having a neurological makeup that is not consistent with your biological makeup.</p>

<p>Gender dysphoria =/= transgenderism.</p>

<p>Ascribing LGBT folks being “normalized” in the media as a dastardly plan to change the populace already seems to presume that any of that is objectively a bad thing, and nearly always ignores that you cannot turn somebody gay or trans. It is fundamentally an inability to recognize that these people have always existed in these numbers, but have been suppressed by the same kinds of attitudes that believe in “cultural Marxism” as an actual force dissimilar from normal cultural transmission in the modern age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry transgender folks, does that offend your sensibilities less? Schizophrenics, as well as people with other mental illnesses like depression having different neurological makeups, that doesn&#39;t mean its not a mental illness. I don&#39;t care if the media &quot;normalizes&quot; LGBT, I care that people like you ignore science to placate the delusions of the mentally ill who should receive treatment instead of having surgeons make a science experiment out of them. I care that people like you seek to ruin childhood by teaching kids that they might be the opposite gender and should consider hormone treatment because it makes you feel enlightened and progressive.

<p>Fact is, there is a great deal of nuance in my opinion of transgender folks and the future they have in society; but you wouldn’t know that because you presume I advocate for children making transitional decisions at young ages. This lack of nuance seems to be extended to your own understanding of the subject, in general.</p>

<p>Listen, man, I know it’s hard to see that maybe I just have strong beliefs about LGBT people (you know, my <em>friends</em>), and would thus want to espouse ideas about them that are true and make sense as opposed to bullshit. I know it’s hard for you to understand a person might be capable of doing something without trying to get anything for themselves out of the equation.</p>

<p>I’m not a brainwashed CIA pawn pushing my agenda to persecute the masculine macho man. I will say to such men, you’ve run the world for a hot minute now and it’s not going so great, so sit down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me ask you this why is &quot;it not going so great&quot; right now? You can look all you want externally but the answers really lie internally. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to be a victim and but your perception of your world is your reality and only <em>you</em> have the power to change it. So why think of world or this sub or this &quot;masculine macho man&quot; as the Boogeyman out to get you? </p>

<p>We are all searching for the same thing love, peace, and unity. Why create this illusion of separation through your thoughts and actions? Your expectations will eventually become your reality if you believe long enough and have enough energy so why expect hated towards you? What you search for with your thoughts you will eventually find so instead expect and search for acceptance rather than having the &quot;masculine macho man sit down&quot;.</p>

<p>The problem IMO is conspiracy is subjective.  One person thinks the liberal media is the big conspiracy, another thinks the military industrial complex propped up by conservative politicians quest for endless war is the big conspiracy.</p>

<p>Both of these folks may agree completely that 9.11 was a fraud, but differ in the details of those behind the curtain.  </p>

<p>Here is one solid post </p>

<p>And there is hatred scattered in random comments. It’s not just me, read the thread and you will see other people were experiencing it too. I’ve never gotten hate <em>directed</em> at me here, I’m mainly a lurker, and I don’t usually discuss my sexuality unless it’s relative to the convo.</p>

<p>I will admit there is more hatred to the Jewish people than there is to the LGBT community, but both are prevalent</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i remember when i was just starting to get into 9/11 truth and a troll attacked me and said i was a jew hating anti-semite</p>

<p>i knew i didn&#39;t do anything to deserve that, so it was shocking to hear </p>

<p>what this troll assumed was that i was looking at suspects, when in fact i was merely looking at evidence. </p>

<p>after i was done looking at evidence, then i started looking at suspects</p>

<p>and thats when the trolls allegations against me started to finally make sense </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t calling you a shill or alluding to you being one. I&#39;m just saying what a shill proved. One post out of <em>nine days worth of posts</em> hardly seems like something to be upset over. And to bring it up nine days after the fact? Your post could&#39;ve gained more traction had you not stewed for nine days. I respect the point you&#39;re trying to make, but I think it&#39;s just one post among many that are clouding what a conspiracy sub could be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is that anti semitism is an emotional factor behind one of the most popular conspiracies - the new world order, one world government. I am new to learning about the history of this conspiracy but there is always some evil mastermind group behind the plot, and it&#39;s usually attributed to jews. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think conspiracy theorists are necessarily anti LGBT in that they usually advocate for less government restrictions and general social tolerance. But the recent alt right movement is nostalgic for tradition including traditional gender roles. They&#39;re concerned about declining white birth rates and focused on white only families. So in that context there&#39;s some anxiety about LGBT whites hurting their race by not reproducing. Or they think LGBT people have fallen into the multicultural snowflake trend, which again gets somehow linked back to a Jewish plot.</p>

<p>I think that <em>used</em> to be the case - but the new generation of conspiracy theorists (Alex Jones era) have definitely bucked that trend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Captain Apollyon&#39;s comments are true. Fair enough people can&#39;t help being gay, but the &#39;LGBT&#39; issues, and transgenderism particularly, seems heavily influenced by both propaganda <em>and</em> chemical pollutants. Doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to realise why you would want a male population who are passive with a low sex drive.</p>

<p>And the Jewish thing is difficult. I don&#39;t want to single out an entire ethnic group as being evil, and for the most part they aren&#39;t, but they did kind of start it by saying they were God&#39;s chosen people, and by starting the main source of monotheism which has murdered millions over the course of thousands of years. Additionally, over history from Rome to present day, they have shown themselves to infiltrate, subvert and profiteer off the destruction off of a host nation.</p>

<p>Strange how they&#39;ve been kicked out of so many countries over the course of a thousand years. Yet its everyone else who has the proble, right?</p>

<p>Now if I walked into an anti LGBT hate group, that rhetoric is expected, and yes, I would defend their rights to say it. </p>

<p>But people just mindlessly attacking people when it’s not appropriate, spewing hate just because, isn’t something I stand for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not a brainwashed CIA pawn pushing my agenda to persecute the masculine macho man. I will say to such men, you’ve run the world for a hot minute now and it’s not going so great, so sit down.</p>

<p>Let me ask you this why is &quot;it not going so great&quot; right now? You can look all you want externally but the answers really lie internally.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to be a victim and but your perception of your world is your reality and only you have the power to change it. So why think of world or this sub or this &quot;masculine macho man&quot; as the Boogeyman out to get you?</p>

<p>We are all searching for the same thing love, peace, and unity. Why create this illusion of separation through your thoughts and actions? Your expectations will eventually become your reality if you believe long enough and have enough energy so why expect hated towards you? What you search for with your thoughts you will eventually find so instead expect and search for acceptance rather than having the &quot;masculine macho man sit down&quot;.</p>

<p>You can choose to see those extremely rare posts as the norm or you can choose to see it for what it is a single person who is misguided. Your choice of how you react to it internally will control how you see things externally. The choice is yours</p>
