<p>Theory: 
FBIAnon and Q have been feeding this forum&#39;s content for months. Someone knew there was ready evidence of election interference  (both the DNC and the &quot;Russian&quot; hackers) and set this &quot;oh look at these crazy accusations of malfeasance&quot; game in place. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying there&#39;s pedophilia rings, but the conspiracy with the Clintons isn&#39;t about CPP. I don&#39;t think the FBI or CIA planned on so many liberals voting 3rd party or not at all. The plan was for a Clinton win and the Pizzagate scandal a way to crack down on internet anonymity and censorship. And likely gun control.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like me saying that I wish flat earth theory was fake news. I have no evidence for flat earth theory either.</p>

<p>So the question becomes, why do you want to believe something so bad, yet has zero evidence, and at the same time, wish there was no evidence? Is it not weird to you that you can&#39;t reconcile these things? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Lolita Express has been never been a (primary) part of Pizzagate canon for one reason - that would force Pizzagaters to include Trump in their group of elite &#39;pedophiles&#39; that they routinely talk about wanting killed.</p>

<p>The fact that actual evidence of powerful politicians engaging in pedophilia or other illegal behaviors is ignored in favor of people getting enraged about social media posts that have nothing to do with them (or illegal acts) or emails they are willfully misinterpreting is PROOF that Pizzagate is nothing but a bullshit partisan attack.</p>

<p>Instead of focusing on non-existent evidence of made up crimes by democrats, why don&#39;t we focus on real, provable crimes by people of all sides? You know, actually fight against pedophilia and sexual abuse while also punishing corrupt people on both sides of the aisle?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My original comment mentioned Pizzagate/Pedogate.  I did it because the terminology confuses a lot of people.  It is why I asked you to define Pizzagate.  That way, I know better how to respond.  </p>

<p>I think it is not a partisan attack.  Both Democrats and Republicans are involved.  In fact, the whole Democrat and Republican labels are a distraction.  They are mostly New World Order globalists who practice a certain religion.  I don&#39;t mean Christianity...  </p>

<p>Like I said, Republicans are also involved.  Have you not researched any of this?  I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but it seems that you would know that both Democrats and Republicans are involved if you researched it.  In fact, Republicans are some of the worse.  </p>

<p>As someone who&#39;s been molested, and called out the actions of molesters, abusers and rapists in real life, this theory is despicable. I also think accusations of pedophilia deserve the respect to be DOCUMENTED and PROSECUTABLE. Anything less than that respect is dangerous to the victims.

    <div class="md"><p>You have a rather unhealthy sense of entitlement and poor reading comprehension.

<p>No they fucking didn&#39;t. What&#39;s the proof of that?</p>

<p>You have none at all. What police looked into it?</p>

<p>The DC Police? The DC Police admitted that they did NOT look into it.</p>

<p>Also - why in the fuck are you bringing homophobia into this? Why are you bringing up drag? Are you getting confused with the number of threads you are making excuses in?</p>

<p>AGAIN - what police &quot;looked into it&quot;???</p>

<p>You say it without evidence. I&#39;ve already told you that they haven&#39;t created any documents that was produced by the FOIA request.</p>

<p>So which is it you question avoiding sycophant?</p>

<p>That&#39;s what is fucking absurd.</p>

<p>I think you are purposely missing the point. I&#39;m not talking about the DC Police assessing threats against Comet Pizza. You are hilarious.
I am talking about the DC Police investigating the allegations against Alefantis et al.</p>

<p>Uhhh what the hell does this have to do with anything? This is irrelevant. I am talking about the DC Police actually investigating, not individuals bringing in photos.</p>

<p>Jesus fucking Christ. You can&#39;t really be this daft.</p>

<p>Who has properly investigated the allegations against Alefantis and others?</p>

<p>You know the answer is NO ONE.</p>
