        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys, it&#39;s (almost) the first time I post actually (not that much of an English writer so please excuse errors). Also I don&#39;t consider myself a conspiracy theorist per say, but nobody cares about that. I think you should be able to theorize. I agree there&#39;s something fishy about 911 though. And also I think the attacks you&#39;ve been subjected to are a conspiracy (just see the couple of threads on your sub right now about the holocaust, and how they are being brigaded).</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought I&#39;d bring something to your attention.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been following the way <a href="/r/TopMindsofReddit">/r/TopMindsofReddit</a> (and other pastures) have been attacking you. It used to be <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, so nothing new under the sun. I understand people don&#39;t like whining girls, and I tend to agree, but I still side with the girls on this one (I understand the very few females among you are the main targets).</p>

<p>I was browsing <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a>, and I found this: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/7olbwg/the_trench_war_between_topmindsofreddit_and/">https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/7olbwg/the_trench_war_between_topmindsofreddit_and/</a></p>

<p>Here is the archived link the poster referenced:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.fo/PFhBe">https://archive.fo/PFhBe</a></p>

<p>Not sure what to think about this. It sure seems a bit extreme. Do you think it is serious? Is it a false flag? Do you think it could endanger this community (or other communities), if the threats are actually real? Can something be unethical and exciting at the same time?</p>

<p>That&#39;s it. Downvote if irrelevant. Bye from Germany.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Playing their game, you may now have something that actually ignites but your just using fear of exposure against them which is not cool, and I am pretty sure in this day and age of fake callers, hackers, etc, will land them in jail (Not a friendly one) real quick. </p>

<p>Not supporting TMoR, they are scumbags, but these tactics are just as dirty, if not more extreme.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This stuff will bring you up to date on 911 at least ..</p>

<p><strong>The official lie says &quot;nineteen Moslem hijackers under the direction of Osama Bin Laden, attacked the United States!”</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://fromtheleft.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/panam103.jpg">OBL denied responsibility</a> as a Moslem, while the campaign against him began in an interview between <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nVFWevtIyk">Jerome Hauer and Dan Rather</a> at CBS News, in New York on the morning of the attacks!</p>

<p>There were no hijackers the planes that struck the WTC Towers were piloted by remote control, using hardware developed by <a href="http://100777.com/node/1836">Rabbi Dov Zakheim</a>, who with Zionists <a href="http://rense.com/general80/key.htm">Jerome Hauer</a> and <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-11-chertoff-side_x.htm">Michael Chertoff</a> engineered the whole project!</p>

<p>The 911 attacks were carried out by Jews who have infiltrated the US social and political order at every level, along with traitors in the CIA and in the halls of Government.</p>

<p>The under 3000 dead line is one of the mainstay falsehoods of the entire conspiracy,  <a href="http://cnparm.home.texas.net/911/911/911b.htm">2:48 PM September 11, 2001,</a> estimates of 50,000 dead in New York were bandied about.</p>

<p>NIST Engineer Sunder said, &quot;on 911 there were between 8,500 and 9,000 occupants in each building,&quot; ABC News Anchor Peter Jennings while the drama was still unfolding said, &quot;the normal total of workers at the WTC Towers was around eighty thousand.&quot;</p>

<p>Sunder&#39;s total of between seventeen and eighteen thousand in the Towers, makes some sixty two thousand or so absent using Peter Jennings figures.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.publiceye.org/frontpage/911/Missing_Jews.htm">Evidence of Mossad Treachery at the WTC, by Ed Toner</a> .. Nearly 500 foreign nationals from over 80 different nations, were killed in the World Trade Center. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>As a center of world trade and finance this is not surprising, it is known many Israelis work in the field of international trade and finance.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The laws of probability dictate there should have been a considerable number of Israelis dead.</p>

<p>Alon Pinkas Israel’s Consul General in New York, confirmed one Israeli dead in each of the planes that crashed into the towers, and one more who had been at the WTC on business.</p>

<p><a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/9110210.PDF">Lt Richard Smiouskas FDNY, 27 November 2001</a> .. after the North Tower air strike &quot;an engineer got me onto the roof of WTC 2, I saw people in the windows they weren&#39;t jumping they were being forced out.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dockersunion.net/vb/showthread.php?6-The-Most-Shameful-Act-on-a-Day-of-Shame!">The NYPD refused to attempt helicopter rescues</a> for those trapped in the burning towers, while the official death toll of some under three thousand is to fit the four hundred dead Jews on the official list.</p>

<p>Who were the ones who stayed and threw others from windows according to Smiouskas testimony, who were sold out when NYPD choppers never showed up.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://911review.org/img/SIPA-N0116740.JPG">The shots of the Pentagon taken after impact</a> and before the facade collapsed showed a hole about the size of a suburban garage, no sign of a plane at all..</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/0deae06d81.jpg">no plane in Pennsylvania</a> despite assertions the Happy Schmooligans blasted <a href="http://www.dockersunion.net/vb/showthread.php?14-Flight-93-on-911-No-Boeing-757-crashed-near-Shanksville!&amp;amp;p=24#post24">Flight 93</a> out of the sky, plenty of paper littering the landscape and burn marks in the trees but no plane.</p>

<p><strong>The American Securities and Exchange Commission says Israeli citizens sold short a list of stocks, that could reasonably be expected to fall in value as a result of the attacks.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>They operated out of stock exchanges in Canada and in Germany, while their profits were specifically stated to be in the hundred$ of million$ of dollars. Christopher Bollyn.</p>

<p>It was via the buddy system on Odigo software, which allows one to communicate to a large group of people that share a trait such as the Hebrew language, that thousands of Israelis were warned not to go to the twin towers on 9/11. RBN News</p>

<p>Odigo and Mossad are based in Herzliya north of Tel Aviv, after 9/11 Odigo was taken over by Comverse Technology another Israeli company, within a year five executives from Comverse were reported to have profited by more than $267 million from “insider trading.” Rumormillnews. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we need to take a look at the &quot;<a href="http://www.dockersunion.net/vb/showthread.php?498-911-Australia-TerrorGr%FCppe-Kurzberg-Pizza-Woodledoodledoo&amp;amp;p=1148#post1148">Celebrating Jews of 911</a>&quot; Yaron Shmuel and Sivan &amp; Paul Kurzberg, who were arrested in New York on 911 filming the attack in their words to &quot;document the event,&quot; all of whom were residents of Brisbane Australia.</p>

<p>I intend to jump about in glee as they, the entire Mossad cell in Brisbane that spawned them and the Australian political hierarchy that grants them free passage, are brought to just trial and legal execution under the same US laws were breached on the day!</p>

<p>Finally moving the goalposts. Excellent. Be careful with your word choices from here on out. You&#39;ve already had to change your words now.</p>

<p>Now - why do you think moderators <em>own</em> subs? Why is it <em>your subreddit</em> (that exists to mock and target harassment at users, might I add)? Is it really just you moderators yucking it up on alts making fun of us or is there an independent thought in that armpit of a sub?</p>

<p>It makes sense if you think subs are just little digital armies of users (I guess?) but that just seems so toxic. And petty. </p>

<p>Not confused at all. You were the only unable to discern that your twisting of the truth is an attack.</p>

<p>Why do they need to be separated? One spends time mocking the other - and the other goes about it&#39;s business and defends itself when it can. One exists without the other - one is simply sad and parasitic.</p>

<p>I would argue the community owns those subs and you are twisting the social contract you have with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They’re now accusing me of being one of the accounts of the doxxer. It was almost certainly a false flag, the first comment advocating doxxing also advocated swatting, which is just far too controversial and topical right now to believable as sincere.</p>

<p>Additionally, I was the person who first pointed out these comments and said that the commenter should face legal punishment for incitement, which he absolutely should.</p>

<p>Also, I cross-posted TMoR on this thread here, because I want to hear their take. Hopefully they won&#39;t downvote the thread too much (or attack me as they attack you because I said &quot;I side with the girls&quot; (I&#39;m female myself)).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about all those banned accounts in the list on TMoR. How do you know those accounts have anything to do with a guy that made doxx threats of site. Y&#39;all have no proof at all why any of these accounts were banned or if they are at all affiliated or who they belong to. </p>

<p>It is nice to hear that a TMoR user agrees that &quot;threatened doxx&quot; should be bannable, though (hi CNN!) because I agree. </p>
