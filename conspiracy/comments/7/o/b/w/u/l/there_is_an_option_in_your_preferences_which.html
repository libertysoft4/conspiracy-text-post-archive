        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have noticed in the comments that many, even those that have been here for years, are unaware that a change can be made in your settings which unveils comments that have been &quot;hidden&quot; by coordinated downvoting.</p>

<p>Under comment options, you see:</p>

<p>&quot;don&#39;t show me comments with a score less than ____.&quot;</p>

<p>Removing the number there and leaving it blank now enables you to see comments which have been brigaded into oblivion by paid interests.  </p>

<p>Viewing Reddit within their box of, &quot;oh, you shouldn&#39;t be exposed to that comment&quot; isn&#39;t acceptable on this sub.</p>

<p>The obvious Paid Brigade here results in fully valid comments (comments which BELONG in a conspiracy theory sub) being buried under an avalanche of inorganic downvotes as the coordinated brigaders attempt to form a narrative here that benefits their employers. They are working together (against the rules of this sub) to &quot;remove&quot; comments from the discussion by exploiting this default preference setting and burying them beyond the public view.</p>

<p>I want all of the organic r/conspiracy users to be aware of this default setting and how it is being exploited here by outsiders just trying to earn an unethical payday.</p>

<p>Edi: u/DontTreadOnMe16 has another extremely important setting change to add that I didn&#39;t mention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An equally if not more useful setting to change is to show &quot;controversial&quot; posts with a little red cross. Then you can see which comments are heavily challenged/supported, even if they are only at +1. Still not as good as the days when we could see total upvotes AND downvotes, but still better than nothing.</p>

<p>Thank you, u/DontTreadOnMe16</p>

I suppose your opinion will not count on those comments, because reddit shielded the lurkers from your unpopular thoughts on those subjects.

<p>When I browse comments, I will decide if the voices are great or not. I don&#39;t need a nanny or groupthink. At any rate, I&#39;d prefer if voting on comments altogether is abolished. Let each comment show up in the order it was posted, and let people use their brains for once.</p>

It really depends what kinds of topics you&#39;re in, I think. Not necessarily the OP, but the comment threads. Some of them lend themselves to jokes and trolls, some of them lend themselves to accidents or misunderstandings, but some of them definitely contain meaningful dialog from opposing sides of a position, and sometimes that dialog gets silenced.</p>

<p>That may apply to other subs of Reddit, but not here. If something has -50 votes, it was most likely hidden intentionally by a brigade.  My post fully explains this. Comments don&#39;t &quot;naturally&quot; get down to -50 votes in this sub. They NEVER DID until David Brock&#39;s Bitches swarmed in here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good advice. On that subject....</p>

<p>I suspect most of you already use RES (reddit enhancement suite), but if not, it is an unofficial browser extension that is well worth looking at. It is a very useful tool to help you keep track of other users, because remembering usernames in a large subreddit is well nigh impossible.</p>

<p>RES allows you to tag those users who you think provide value to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and those who appear to....have other agendas. It also keeps a score of all your up/down votes for other users, which I find very helpful (both as a long-time conspiracy user, and as a mod here).</p>

<p>Disclaimer (since the very fact that an <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod is recommending RES will make some of you suspect it&#39;s a trick): I have no connection or affiliation with RES. I have no idea who or what is behind RES. If you are worried about the security aspect of RES knowing your preferences, don&#39;t use it. However, it goes without saying that reddit already knows everything RES knows about you anyway and much more, though not as much your smartphone does, so ditch that first. It&#39;s a question of weighing up pros and cons. For extra security, you could use a VPN. </p>

Then you can see which comments are heavily challenged/supported, even if they are only at +1. Still not as good as the days when we could see total upvotes AND downvotes, but still better than nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My comment pointing out the vote manipulation in a particular thread here got &quot;hidden&quot; by vote brigading, exactly as I described in the post. I&#39;m re-postimg my comment because it shouldn&#39;t be hidden by brigading cunts.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The comments still show up, it just says &quot;This comment is below the score threshold. Click to show comment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re actually advocating that people do manually, every time, something that could be done automatically after changing the setting just once.</p>

<p>How very inefficient, and quite a strange suggestion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And far more than not it&#39;s downvoted for a good reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That may apply to other subs of Reddit, but not here. If something has -50 votes, it was most likely hidden intentionally by a brigade. My post fully explains this. Comments don&#39;t &quot;naturally&quot; get down to -50 votes in this sub. They NEVER DID until David Brock&#39;s Bitches swarmed in here.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;d like to point out the brigade currently occurring in this thread. Look at that one comment that advises against making hidden comments visible. That comment has the most upvotes in this thread, in a conspiracy sub. Mainstream ways of thinking are suddenly &quot;popular opinion&quot; here in r/conspiracy. Fascinating!!</p>

<p>Take note: 2 hours in, the top comment advocating intentional and willful ignorance of vote input has 17 votes, the most upvoted comment here.</p>

<p>TL;DR I made a post explaining how to make vote manipulation more obvious, and the most upvoted comment in this thread is advising against it and advocating groupthink in a conspiracy theory sub. You do the math.</p>
