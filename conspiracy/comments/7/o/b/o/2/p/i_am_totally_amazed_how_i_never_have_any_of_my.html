    <div class="md"><p>Some people, whom I know personally in Illinois, do use this stuff for medicine. I am a huge advocate for this because my mom and my step dad died from prescription painkiller overdoses. If they had medical marijuana I know for a fact they would still be alive today. It may not be the best thing to do all of the time, but as far as medical applications, it outweighs prescription painkillers by far. Plus alot of people in here are usually for individual rights. So it kind of falls hand in hand with advocation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say anything about legalization. I&#39;m just concerned that marijuana is being peddled as a completely benign wonder drug. There are posts on The Daily claiming that marijuana cures cancer making it to the front page of this subreddit. That doesn&#39;t even make any fucking sense. It is like alcohol, and doesn&#39;t necessarily 100% impede your ability to succeed. But it&#39;s going to definitely be a major roadblock for people who don&#39;t have that extra bit of determination. I know people who run businesses that are afflicted with all sorts of disorders using drugs and everything else. But they are definitely the outliers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are 100% correct. And I speak from personal experience. It absolutely is part of the control system, and not ironically one of it&#39;s hooks is that it &#39;frees&#39; your mind. It does change your perspective, but blinds you from the fact that the regular user is has become even more controlled than before they partook. I also am 100% convinced that specific Media content is designed to work in concert with the altered state of the regular user. I would say this reality pertains to all drugs, whether legal or illegal.</p>

<p>Marijuana does have legitimate medical uses, but so do many other natural plants. And for the record I don&#39;t believe ANY substance should be illegal to consume. What a person puts into their body is their own damn business and right. By making a substance illegal you actually create a criminal underclass (see: Prohibition and the Mob) and thus connect this community with the real criminal underworld of; murder for hire, organized crime, human trafficking(slavery, underage prostitution), child pornography, snuff films, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t agree at all. There are plenty of extremely successful people who are notorious stoners. Obviously there are people who get high and are just lazy bums but that has more to do with the person than it has to do with pot. Marijuana also has a lot of medical potential. I personally use CBD oil and smoke in order to treat my colitis and I’d never go back to using traditional medications. I’m in college and marijuana allows me to live a normal life and if anything allows me to live a better and more productive life because of it. Also have a friend who’s younger sister uses CBD oil for seizures and it’s changed their life too. People can abuse anything and there are concerns with every drug but comparatively Marijuana’s dangers are minimal. I just believe there are way more serious threats to people’s lives than marijuana. </p>

I love who I am, but I know I’m in a hole because I love to stimulate my reward centres. I’m not freeing my mind or getting spiritual, I just like how it feels.</p>

<p>Funny how the overwhelming response here is anecdotes of some millionaire you know who blazes daily. That’s hardly scientific. think of how many poor and demotivated individuals you know in your life who blaze vs success stories who blaze. Overall, I smoked myself retarded... i know this. I wish I hadn’t, but I guess I like myself more when I’m a retard than when I was a judgemental asshole.</p>
