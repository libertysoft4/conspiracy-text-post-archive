<p>I, like I&#39;ve been doing for years and years, sent him some type of documentary or something about 911 seeing an inside job.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been pointing out that there wasn&#39;t the proper engines for the plane that hit the pentagon and that the impact doesn&#39;t look like a plane more like a cruise missile and to top it off they won&#39;t release that frame that shows the impact </p>

<p>He says bullshit </p>

<p>Then he turned around and said oh but there is something weird going on in Vegas. </p>

<p>I almost flipped my shit but caught myself and realized this is the chink in his bootlicking armor I&#39;ve needed for years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t ever remember being told that &quot;myth&quot; in an educational setting; I was in elementary school in the 90&#39;s. </p>

<p>I think its more of a Mandela Effect. </p>

<p>Basically what I was taught was CC was trying to find a quicker route to the Far East and just proposed it could be quicker sailing West and not East. </p>

<p>I think the &quot;myth&quot; everyone was &quot;taught&quot; was just our young minds&#39; seeing a flat map on the classroom wall and his linear path on it. </p>

<p>Its just like how we are taught CC &quot;Found&quot; NA, when it has been widely accepted that the Vikings found it first. They just had no ongoing historical impact or spark surrounding the event, so its just easier to say it was CC because that&#39;s when things started heating up rather than getting into little details that an 8 year old doesn&#39;t need to be concerned with yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a painting, a poetic license on something that was known not to be true, they weren&#39;t used as an educational graphic portraying reality during that time.</p>

<p>Also, the &quot;fall off the edge&quot; was just a carry over from the lack of understanding of Newtonian physics, which <em>were</em> new during that time, and the hyperbole the paintings depict. </p>

<p>The common man knew the world was round. What perhaps they didn&#39;t understand was how you would stay glued to the &quot;bottom&quot; part of the globe.  So a commoner might think, &quot;Hmmm were gonna sail over the curvy part... are we just gonna, &#39;fall off&#39; at some point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think you are missing the point </p>

<p>yes, we know they took liberties with reality in crafting our education. </p>

<p>the reason i am aware of the stories, and the paintings, is because thats what we were taught in school</p>

<p>which is the topic of this article </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The common man knew the world was round.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if that was the case, how did &quot;flat earth&quot; ever become a thing, in the years after CC? </p>

<p>and why were Columbus and Magellan featured so prominently in our education? </p>

<p>those two men, among others, were used to help craft a narrative about flat earth. </p>

<p>in particular, how CC and FM were the visionary geniuses who knew the earth was round, in an era when the common man believed something else.  </p>

<p>same story with Galileo. GG was a visionary in an era of Artistotle&#39;s dogma. </p>

<p>and Newton...</p>

<p>i think my education, in particular, and this lesson, in particular, were crafted as a way to deceive me, not as a way to educate me</p>

<p>i think that those responsible for creating the curriculum for my education must have at some point, after they educated me, decided that teaching this particular lie was not worth it. </p>

<p>i suspect that they noticed that in spite of trying to introduce &quot;flat earth&quot; to young, impressionable minds, they were still introducing the idea to curious, inquisitive minds who might look into it further. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s right though. All my life growing up I was never taught that the Golf of Tonkin incident was a false flag, for instance. There are MANY MORE examples of this in the American education system. I wouldn&#39;t blame the teachers, though. They teach us what they themselves were taught and believe in their hearts that they are RIGHT. So in there eyes, it makes no sense to try and fact check an educational textbook. Especially if it appears that all of the info contained within is information they themselves have learned. </p>

<p>Besides, history takes a MAJOR backseat to &quot;the curriculum&quot; which is whatever is going to be on state mandated tests. So math, science, reading comp, and writing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never taught in either direction is different than being taught a lie. Especially with something of more recent history like the GoT.</p>

<p>I asked my high school history teacher why all the text books seemed to lack in-depth chapters after the 1950&#39;s, basically just listing earmarked events, but not giving much detail, despite the books being pretty new. </p>

<p>The answer he gave was pretty insightful. </p>

<p>He said that for something to get into a non-biased history book and to be written at length, it needs to have happened AT LEAST 1 generation ago, i.e. all the people up to the ones born during the event have died. Preferable 2 generations later and 3 is better. </p>

<p>This way when it is written about in detail, the authors or researchers have more perspective on on the event, and the outcomes it had and thus would be less likely to bias writing.</p>

<p>The essays and articles that are being published now, on say the GoT are what will eventually be their primary sources, with the added perspective of being a few generations away from the people alive during the event, and the people that start publishing the real truth about the event. </p>

<p>Damn well looks like a cyclops skeleton, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>It’s just a fossilized dwarf elephant. But it is another example of a similar claim about giant cyclopses being real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was it? Your bullet proof evidence?</p>

<p>Every single one of those bones that were pictured in his video were recreations of bones who&#39;s measurements were taking 50+ years ago, with no trace of the real bones. They were most likely misidentified or was a tabloid article. Just because something was in the paper 50 years ago doesn&#39;t mean it was legit. Back then tabloids and legit papers were often one in the same. </p>

<p>Also, most of the more believable claims seemed to average around 7-9 feet tall, which doe occur within our species. </p>

<p>Discovering ancient bones from the last 10,000 years, statistically you are going to come across people who suffered from giantism, that doesn&#39;t mean there was an ancient race of giants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Than what is it? A cube?<br/>
Did you even read my comment? It&#39;s &quot;nasha&quot; not &quot;nasa&quot;. Go look it up if you don&#39;t believe me.  </p>

<p>It would be stupid to call an agency &quot;Municipal Active Veracity Enforcement Team&quot; because that doesn&#39;t mean anything. On the other hand, it makes perfect sense to call a national administration that oversees aeronautical and space research the national aeronautics and space administration. It wasn&#39;t even originally called that either. It was the &quot;National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics&quot; (NACA) until 1958.  </p>

<p>Even after all this, it doesn&#39;t mean anything. The fact that is similar to the Hebrew word for deception means literally nothing. It&#39;s called a coincidence, and there are a lot of them. You can &quot;prove&quot; anything if you go off stupid coincidences and wordplay. If you want to actually debunk something that they have done, feel free. Unfortunately, you won&#39;t.  </p>

<p>I mean, it would be very strange for some shadowy Jewish organization to use a former Nazi who used Jewish slave labor to design their rockets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you say the concord never saw curvature? In <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YoWyqN4.jpg">this image</a> there is a very apparent curve. It was definitely harder to see it because the Concorde&#39;s windows were about the size of your palm, but it was there.  </p>

<p>The question is answered different by everyone because different people are answering it. If you just google the question, 35,000 - 40,000 ft is the typical answer and it is the correct one based off my observation. Obviously different people with better or worse eyesight are going to see it at slightly different altitudes, but it quite clearly becomes apparent at around that altitude.</p>

What is the first one trying to say? It&#39;s just the same picture of the same flag from 2 opposite sides? There isn&#39;t anything wrong with either photo. It even says they are both from Apollo 11 in the url for the pictures.  </p>

4. No. The answer is no. You don&#39;t need to continuously provide thrust to a baseball to make it fly after you hit it. The baseball starts with X amount of vertical kinetic energy, and as it moves towards the peak of its trajectory that kinetic energy converts into potential energy. I think you learn this in high school.<br/>
  5.  No. There is (basically) no air resistance. There isn&#39;t anything slowing you down. You don&#39;t need to continuously burn fuel to stay in orbit. Once again, high school.<br/>
  7. It&#39;s effecting it in the exact same way. Gravity does not magically disappear when you reach orbit. There is still plenty of gravity. The only difference is that the orbiting object has enough <a href="http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2001/08/newton_s_cannon/9208778-5-eng-GB/Newton_s_cannon_large.gif">horizontal velocity to basically &quot;miss&quot; the earth</a>. Objects in orbit are continuously falling.<br/>
    9. No. Once you get enough speed, you will just keep going. There would have to be some magical external force that&#39;s slowing you down for you to continuously need to burn fuel.<br/>
  11. No, because the spacecraft it is carrying is significantly smaller at that point, and because kinetic energy is proportional to mass you would need FAR less than 1/6th the fuel.<br/>
12. Yes, it sure does. Wtf kind of a question is that?<br/>
13. It&#39;s relative speed to the vehicle it is docking with at the time of docking would be almost zero. Docking at that point would be just as easy as parking a car, you would just need more precision. Idiotic and loaded question.<br/>
21. Another loaded question. The vehicle simply obtains enough velocity that it will simply continuing going away from the earth forever. Once gain, I&#39;m pretty sure you learn the escape velocity equation in high school.<br/>
22. Once again, kind of a loaded an inaccurate question. Same reason as the one before.<br/>
24. No, because whoever wrote this is either severely mentally handicapped, in middle school, trolling, or intentionally manipulative.  </p>

<p>Dude, maybe try to learn about some of these things instead of blindly following some idiots ramblings on the internet. I&#39;m telling you, I did not need to look up a single thing to debunk that nonsense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lol, here we go.</p>

<p>What is the first one trying to say? It&#39;s just the same picture of the same flag from 2 opposite sides? There isn&#39;t anything wrong with either photo. It even says they are both from Apollo 11 in the url for the pictures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if you were able to follow directions, you would have noticed that the flag is not merely photographed from different sides, but that the folds of the flag, and the shadows the folds, make it obvious that it is merely an &quot;image flip&quot; photo manipulation technique that probably seemed high-tech in the 1960&#39;s but is child&#39;s play in 2018</p>

<blockquote>

<ol>
<li>No. The answer is no. You don&#39;t need to continuously provide thrust to a baseball to make it fly after you hit it. The baseball starts with X amount of vertical kinetic energy, and as it moves towards the peak of its trajectory that kinetic energy converts into potential energy. I think you learn this in high school.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>yes. what you learn in high school is that the baseball comes back to earth. when you finally get into calculus 1, you can actually regurgitate the mathematics of the curve of a thrown baseball for a grade</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>No. There is (basically) no air resistance. There isn&#39;t anything slowing you down. You don&#39;t need to continuously burn fuel to stay in orbit. Once again, high school.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>so, according to your high school level of understanding, none of the other processes going on during the trip would require energy? things like communications, life-support, etc</p>

<p>the reason 5 is included is to mock the idea of the so-called &quot;sling shot effect&quot;, where a rocket would magically acquire energy </p>

<p>this so-called &quot;sling shot effect&quot; would be akin to creating a pendulum that would swing higher than its initial starting point. this is not possible according to our understandings, yet features prominently in science fiction. </p>

<p>so if we really analyze 5, we see that orbiting the Earth a few times would cost the rocket far more energy than it would ever gain back.  </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>It&#39;s effecting it in the exact same way. Gravity does not magically disappear when you reach orbit. There is still plenty of gravity. The only difference is that the orbiting object has enough horizontal velocity to basically &quot;miss&quot; the earth. Objects in orbit are continuously falling.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>the rocket is not merely &quot;in orbit&quot;, or maintaining its elevation. </p>

<p>the rocket is heading toward the moon, increasing its elevation, and thereby increasing its gravitational potential energy, relative to earth, for the entire time. </p>

<p>you should&#39;ve learned about the conservation of energy in high school </p>

<li>No. Once you get enough speed, you will just keep going. There would have to be some magical external force that&#39;s slowing you down for you to continuously need to burn fuel.</li>

<p>&quot;magical external force&quot;; the Earth&#39;s gravity will slow you down anywhere between the Earth and the moon, regardless of how fast you are going. </p>

<p>&quot;escape velocity&quot; and &quot;sling shot effect&quot; and &quot;rocket equation&quot; are all concepts borrowed from the realm of science fiction. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law</a></p>

<p>basically, the lay people tend to believe that gravity goes to 0 very quickly between earth and moon</p>

<p>but the inverse square law informs us that gravity is plenty strong all the way to the moon and beyond, and that it never really goes to 0. </p>

<p>so that means your &quot;uphill&quot; journey to the moon will be &quot;uphill&quot; all the way. you will never travel in a plane where the slope of the effect of gravity is 0, anywhere between earth and moon</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>No, because the spacecraft it is carrying is significantly smaller at that point, and because kinetic energy is proportional to mass you would need FAR less than 1/6th the fuel.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>it can be argued that the mass of the moon is only 1/100th that of Earth</p>

<p>however on the other hand, you would still have to account for the fuel consumption required to control the decent. otherwise the lander would crash into the moon at max speed </p>

<p>also noteworthy is the fact that you can&#39;t actually find any credible video of the lunar lander launch and/or docking with an orbiter. </p>

<p>then, the lunar orbiter would have to have enough fuel to go back &quot;uphill&quot; toward the LaGrange Point</p>

<p>if this was basketball, they would have us believe that they made 100% of their free throws, without ever taking a practice shot. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>do you think it would be a remarkable feat of STEM to launch a lander off the moon, and have it intercept an orbiter? </p>

<p>you claim that the relative speeds would be zero, but that is false. </p>

<p>the lunar lander is on the surface of the moon, not moving at all, relative to the moon </p>

<p>and the lunar orbiter is in orbit, moving relative to the surface of the moon.</p>

<p>supposedly the lander would have to launch from speed 0 and dock at speed 3600 MPH</p>

<p>its not a loaded question. its a real story problem that you would have to solve if you had actually gone to the moon. </p>

<li>Another loaded question. The vehicle simply obtains enough velocity that it will simply continuing going away from the earth forever. Once gain, I&#39;m pretty sure you learn the escape velocity equation in high school.</li>
</ol>

<p>unfortunately, you quit studying math and physics in high school. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity</a></p>

<p>&quot;escape velocity&quot; is the myth that if a rocket attains a speed of 25,000 MPH, then magically Earth&#39;s gravity will quit affecting the rocket. </p>

<p>since lay people tend to have trouble grasping large numbers</p>

<p>(example: the L curve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woIkIph5xcU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woIkIph5xcU</a> )</p>

<p>ill break it down into smaller numbers, much like those presented in the original. </p>

<p>lets say a car is planned to travel at 25 MHP uphill for 200 miles</p>

<p>if you killed the engine once the car reached 25 MPH, would you expect the car to travel an additional 200 miles? or even an additional 20 miles? or even an additional 2 miles?</p>

<p>of course not. you would expect the car to coast to a stop very quickly. if you have ever run out of gas, you will learn that you won&#39;t get far on &quot;sail boat fuel&quot;</p>

<p>you will of course argue about the rolling friction of the tires, the air drag etc</p>

<p>but the biggest force at play will be gravity. and in our example, the car would actually be going &quot;uphill&quot; at 90 degrees, which is what you see a rocket do during launch (90 degrees to gravity)</p>

<p>&quot;escape velocity&quot; is science fiction. you have never experienced it. nobody you will ever meet has ever experienced it. nobody ever will experience it. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>why is this a loaded question? because cognitive dissonance? </p>

<p>this question reiterates the absurdity of the science fiction of &quot;escaping gravity&quot;</p>

<p>you cannot &quot;escape gravity&quot; anywhere between the earth and the moon, since the gravity of the earth and the moon are both present in the space between the earth and moon. </p>

<p>going faster than 25,000 MPH does not change this fact. </p>

<p>would traveling 25,000 MPH on Earth somehow make the gravity of the moon less strong?</p>

<p>yes. what you learn in high school is that the baseball comes back to Earth. when you finally get into calculus 1, you can actually regurgitate the mathematics of the curve of a thrown baseball for a grade  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? And the rocket would come back to earth too if it slowed down enough.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so, according to your high school level of understanding, none of the other processes going on during the trip would require energy? things like CPU, control, communications, life-support, etc  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? When did I say that? Stururn V had fuel cells for power, but it did not need to burn fuel to physically stay in orbit. As it was claimed.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the reason 5 is included is to mock the idea of the so-called &quot;sling shot effect&quot;, where a rocket would magically acquire energy  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you want to read about the gravitational slingshot effect? It&#39;s not magically gaining energy from nothing. I&#39;ll just copy and paste something from your own link:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The spacecraft&#39;s speed increases as it approaches the planet and decreases while escaping its gravitational pull (which is approximately the same), but because the planet orbits the Sun the spacecraft is affected by this motion during the maneuver. To increase speed, the spacecraft flies with the movement of the planet (taking a small amount of the planet&#39;s orbital energy); to decrease speed, the spacecraft flies against the movement of the planet. The sum of the kinetic energies of both bodies remains constant (see elastic collision). A slingshot maneuver can therefore be used to change the spaceship&#39;s trajectory and speed relative to the Sun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so if we really analyze 5, we see that orbiting the Earth a few times would cost the rocket far more energy than it would ever gain back.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How could you have possibly come to that conclusion?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the rocket is not merely &quot;in orbit&quot;, or maintaining its elevation.
the rocket is heading toward the moon, increasing its elevation, and thereby increasing its gravitational potential energy, relative to earth, for the entire time.
which as you know, would require energy from some other source (fuel) to be converted into this increased gravitational potential energy.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The energy came from the fuel. It&#39;s already there in the form of kinetic energy when the engine shuts off. I am well aware of this concept, and you are the person denying its existence. When the engine cuts off the rocket has kinetic energy, and that kinetic energy is converted to potential energy as it moves away from the earth. It&#39;s literally the exact same thing as throwing a baseball in the air.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;escape velocity&quot; and &quot;sling shot effect&quot; and &quot;rocket equation&quot; are all concepts borrowed from the realm of science fiction.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are concepts with hard math behind them. Did you even read what you linked? The one on gravity assist specifically states that it came from a scientific paper. The equation for escape velocity is derived from the equations for kinetic and potential energy. The wiki page for the rocket equation specifically says that it was derived by mathematicians.   </p>

<p>Even if it came from ideas from science fiction writers, how does that prove anything? The idea for the nuclear bomb came from a science fiction book and that ended up working pretty well.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but the inverse square law informs us that gravity is plenty strong all the way to the moon and beyond, and that it never really goes to 0.  </p>

<p>Yup, but at some point the moons gravity exceeds the earth&#39;s.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>it can be argued that the mass of the moon is only 1/100th that of Earth  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s about 1/81st, but yeah.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Of course you do, but once again, the lunar descent and ascent vehicles weigh almost nothing in comparison to the entire rocket. Just to give you an idea on the ascent figure, the lunar ascent module weighed about 4700kg. Doing some math and throwing in a bonus for a lack of air resistance and slightly more efficient engines, and you are looking at needing around ~4000x less fuel for the ascent. If you want to go do the math for it, feel free.  </p>

<p>What do you mean no credible video? According to who? There is plenty of video.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>this is a matter of opinion. an exercise in critical thinking.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I can conclude that it can fly back up and dock. What about the design indicates that it can&#39;t? If you asked a genius scientist from 200 years ago if they thought a 737 could fly, they would probably say that notion was ridiculous. Doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t fly.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Lunar Lander is held together with tape  </p>

<p>They are industrial adhesive strips, and not really. They are just holding the thermal insulation in place.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(try not to laugh, ok. i know it looks fake af, but its totally real!)  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How exactly does it look fake? The lunar ascent vehicle burned hypergolic propellants, which burn clear. The addition of it being in a vacuum makes it even clearer.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you think it would be a remarkable feat of STEM to launch a lander off the moon, and have it intercept an orbiter?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but it&#39;s not too hard. You just time the launch at the right time and go after it.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve done a docking in a simulator before. It&#39;s definitely difficult, but clearly not impossible.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you claim that the relative speeds would be zero, but that is false.  </p>

<p>I claimed the relative speeds at the time of docking would be almost zero. Why do you have to lie?  </p>

<p>And they did solve it. It was definitely not the first docking of 2 vehicles.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;escape velocity&quot; is the myth that if a rocket attains a speed of 25,000 MPH, then magically Earth&#39;s gravity will quit affecting the rocket.  </p>

<p>Did you read that wikipedia page? It gives a very thorough explanation of it.<br/>
Of course gravity will always be influencing it, but you can get enough energy to continuously travel away forever.  </p>

<p>You clearly do not understand how it is possible to escape, so I will try to explain with numbers. You argue that because gravity will always be acting on it, then it will always be slowing down and eventually fall back to earth. That is not true.<br/>
Let&#39;s take an infinite series for example. The classic is the series 1 + .5 + .25 + .125 + .0625 etc.....<br/>
Despite the fact that that series goes on forever, it still has an end. It still has a very definite value that the series adds up to. And that value is.... 2.<br/>
By your logic, the sum of that series is infinite.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>why is this a loaded question? because cognitive dissonance?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, because it&#39;s laced with an incorrect assumption. If I asked you the question &quot;Why did you kill Abraham Lincoln&quot;, that would be a loaded question because obviously you didn&#39;t kill Abraham Lincoln.  </p>

<p>Your refusal to try and understand how escape velocity works and your baseless denial of it&#39;s existence based on your own flawed logic does not mean you are right.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you would continue your math studies, you will encounter this math in Calculus 1  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which you clearly did not complete. I believe you learn the sum of an infinite series in precalculus.      </p>

<p>I also want to point out one fact that you are missing:<br/>
<strong><em>NONE OF THE APOLLO MISSIONS EVER REACHED ESCAPE VELOCITY</em></strong><br/>
Apollo 10 got the closest, but even it was off by a pretty decent amount.</p>

<p>I encourage you to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_loUDS4c3Cs">this video</a> explaining how the moon landing could not have been faked with film technology at the time.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care to click on your links because they are simply parroting the normal arguments that have all been debunked and I have already spent time looking at and debunking myself. So many of these videos are filled with blatant lies and moronic ideas that they are not worth watching. You seem to be smarter than the normal hoaxer and I am very disappointed that you fail to try and look at any of these videos critically. I admit that I have in the past been intrigued by arguments that the moon landing was faked, but I was able to dispel those ideas. You, instead of actually looking into it at all, simply lap it up. </p>

<p>If you want to give me anything new here, feel free to put it in writing. I&#39;ll be happy to debunk it.</p>

<p>the reason i was able to craft the 24 questions, is because i understand the arguments. why do i understand the arguments? because I&#39;ve been debating the math and physics of the moon landings for over 20 years, with all sorts of people from all sorts of backgrounds</p>

<p>i can tell you that your video is one of the most popular videos cited as evidence, </p>

<p>and i always debunk it with the same wikipedia link</p>

<p>i can tell you that your next argument will be that if it was faked, then surely some Russians would have told you...somehow...</p>

<p>there is at least one blogger who took my 24 questions to task on his blog. google is your friend, not really</p>

<p>most people do not put any effort into debunking the 24 questions</p>

<p>so i applaud your effort, and your temperament</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yup, but at some point the moons gravity exceeds the earth&#39;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point</a></p>

<p>it is no accident that Lagrange Points were deliberately left out of your math and physics education </p>

<p>because the existence of a single point where the effects of both gravities cancel each other out, </p>

<p>debunks the myth of the &quot;flat space&quot; that is alluded to in the moon landing myths</p>

<p>in fact, it is &quot;uphill&quot; all the way to a Lagrange POINT, and then downhill to the moon on the other side </p>

<p>all that wikipedia stuff i cited, is called &quot;techno-babble&quot;</p>

<p>like when Scotty says &quot;Captain the Flux Capacitors are...&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technobabble">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technobabble</a></p>

<p>the point of 24 questions is not necessarily to convince you that i am right and you are wrong</p>

<p>the point is to introduce some ideas in a logical order, and let the person think about them for a while</p>

<p>the answers are actually irrelevant, because it is the questions that are the payload, so to speak. </p>

<p>once you have thought about these questions, they will nag in your mind until they are resolved</p>

<p>like, you may think you are standing fast, but the future is already set in motion</p>

<p>ask yourself this simple question</p>

<p>why didn&#39;t they teach you about Lagrange Points?</p>

<p>i suspect the reason is because you can&#39;t be aware of the existence of a Lagrange Point,</p>

<p>and still believe that a rocket can coast uphill for 200,000 miles</p>

<p>and back thru the same on return from the moon... </p>

<p>&quot;it doesn&#39;t add up&quot; as they say</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A childhood friend of mine became a flag earther after I lost touch with him for a year or two. We had 5 or 6 very long talks about it. He was all in.</p>

<p>Not sure how much I influenced him, but he came out of it about 6 months ago. He didn&#39;t want to talk about to, but said he was embarrassed to bring it up anymore, and that was that.</p>

<p>I found out recently he was smoking 3-5 joints a day during the flat earth time, and experimenting with mushrooms. He just kinda lost it for a year or two. Video games and YouTube for 10 - 15 hours a day probably didn&#39;t help either. He went to the bottom of that rabbit hole </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get why people think this. I hate the whole censoring of anyone especially a conspiracy theory but those flat Earth videos on YouTube can really mess someone up if they watch a few but somehow they never present actual evidence </p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAHAHA. That&#39;s not how rockets work man. Rockets and jet engines don&#39;t &quot;push&quot; on anything.  </p>

<p>Have you ever heard of newton&#39;s third law of motion? Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. If you expel 1 ton of fuel out of a nozzle at 5000mph, there is going to be one hell of a kick in the opposite direction. It&#39;s the conservation of momentum man. I&#39;m pretty sure they teach you this and the math behind it in 11th grade.  </p>

<p>In fact, rocket engines actually work BETTER in a vacuum. If you look at the wikipedia page for pretty much any rocket engine, you will not two different efficiency and thrust figures, one for the atmosphere and one for a vacuum. You will also note that the one in a vacuum is larger. See the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pJRagmK.png">SSME</a>.</p>

<p>As I have already said, you have full access to the upper atmosphere. Just buy plane tickets that take you on a higher flight path.

<p>We have been able to observe that the earth was round for quite a bit longer than we&#39;ve had planes. We&#39;ve known for well over 2,000 years. Eratosthenes measured the circumference of the earth with extraordinary accuracy in 200 BC (he was off by 0.16%).</p>

We dont have access to satellite levels of altitude, not without government approval and disclosure agreements.
Al those old round earth hypotheses can be explained by other frames of reference, for example, Eratosthenes could have been fooled by a closer smaller sun....  but most importantly, about the egyptologist and archeologists, NO they dont want to discuss anything about it Zahi Hawass vs Graham Hancock on significance of Gobekli Tepe ...

<blockquote>
<p>We dont have access to satellite levels of altitude  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, you do. You can buy the equipment necessary to track and steal images from satellites for relatively cheap. It&#39;s hard as hell to do, but people do it for fun all the time. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RTLSDR/">There is an entire subreddit for it</a>. This guy grabbed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RTLSDR/comments/7oc229/meteor_m2_image_of_winter_storm_grayson/">a nice shot</a> from a Russian satellite. You can listen to radio chatter on the ISS and stuff like that too. You can talk to astronauts sometimes too if you&#39;re lucky.</p>

<p>I also fail to see  why you need to be in space to see that the earth isn&#39;t flat. You keep moving the altitude that you need to be every time I counter you. Stop running away from it and face the facts. I also want to point out that you failed to counter any of those points in previous comments.  </p>

<p>Ahh yes, the famous sun on a flat earth. Something that clearly makes no sense, but you lap it up anyway. A sun that magically only shines on one side of the earth at a time, and quite obviously goes over the horizon yet still magically maintains a high altitude, circling around the earth.</p>

<p>One or two people not liking a new find does not mean the entire scientific community is against it. Try again.</p>

<p>People think America went 6 times in 4 years but the USSR was like &quot;ah fuck it. They already went.&quot; Right, that&#39;s about the dumbest concept in a series of dumb concepts that have to be believed to <em>still somehow</em> think man went to the moon. </p>

So you fall down a never ending rabbit hole and are left with the question, what IS real? So to me anyways its understandable.

To think that there are people like you out there that actually believe this shit, and you can vote! Even have kids! Holy fuck. Blows my fucking mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole thread is another perfect example of people getting crazy just because somebody might have a different point of view. I&#39;d wager that every single person who has made a comment mocking the tiniest possibility the earth could be something other than round knows somebody who is open to the idea of the FE theory. Let me repeat, I said &quot;open to the idea&quot;, as in having a civil back and forth discussion without it turning into a fist fight.
The responses here prove that bringing up the subject at all can turn on the fingers-in-your-ears switch. 
The question shouldn&#39;t be &quot;anyone ever met a flat earther&quot; but why does the slightest hint of FE talk make people so angry? Why is it that even bringing up the subject makes people mock and curse and accuse others of being out of their minds? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t understand why there even has to be an edge. If you imagine a 2d video game where the world “wraps around” when the player gets to the edge of the screen, is there really an edge from the player’s perspective?</p>

<p>I’m not making fun, nor am I a flat earther, but there are many widely accepted theories out there that are accepted based on the same math that could also explain a 2d earth. Yet those theories are not ridiculed as the flat earth theory is. </p>

<p>Suppose Elon Musk is right and our reality is a simulation of some sort. That would essentially mean that the earth could be flat, in the sense that it’s shape would obey the rules of the simulation. Like how google earth is actually flat but gives the user the illusion of roundness. </p>

<p>Anyway, I’m not debating the merits of either theory so much as pointing out that both have equal merits yet only one is ridiculed for some reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOFL. The &quot;theory&quot; of gravitation can&#39;t be explained on spinny-ball earth. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a theory. I can derive the constant for acceleration due to gravity. I can tell you how long a ball you throw will stay in the air. Even Newton said he could describe what gravity does but not say what it was. It&#39;s just the measurable effect we experience that what goes up must come down. Flat earth or spinny-ball earth, either way we have a mystery on our hands. </p>

<p>Except for with spinny-ball earth, you have to believe you&#39;re in an elliptical orbit going faster than the speed of sound while spinning at 1,000 miles an hour but water looks like <a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/711/22877015597_aea3767756_o.jpg">this</a> rather than <a href="http://betterphotography.in/wp-content/contest_uploads/11/0000186/11_0000186_015694.jpg">this</a>.</p>

<p>Should be darn easy to disprove then. Show your work for the Nobel.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s why it&#39;s a theory&quot; is a laughable comment. At a minimum, go to Wikipedia and read just a little bit about &quot;Scientific Theory.&quot; Obviously you haven&#39;t taken (or can&#39;t remember after the head injury) a single undergrad science class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I can&#39;t go that far, but back in the 90&#39;s I had some written contact with them (keep in mind this was very early days of or even pre internet). </p>

<p>Because of my interest in The Church of the SubGenius I had read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Weirdness_by_Mail">this book</a>. It mentioned The Flat Earth Society and had a photo of a flat earth map they produced. I really wanted a copy of the map as a wall decoration. </p>

<p>At that point there only real exposure to the public had been that book and a mention on a show like That&#39;s Incredible (or some similar show). </p>

<p>So I wrote them and they wrote back asking some pointed questions about where I had heard of them and why I was interested. They specifically said something along the lines of &quot;If you saw us on That&#39;s Incredible and think this is funny please do not reply&quot;. I don&#39;t think they were even aware of the High Weirdness book, but were very sensitive to people laughing at them even in the age when everything was done by mail.</p>

<p>From corresponding with them I got the impression the entire Flat Earth Society could hold a meeting in one, at most maybe two booths in a diner. I think it was essentially a man and wife and a very few scattered other members.</p>

<p>Also everything they wrote was based first and foremost on their reading of scripture. They did attempt to make physical arguments that seem to be more popular with the current incantation, but everything flowed from their reading of The Bible. Very similar to young earth creationists. They will try to use their version of science to argue, but The Bible is the starting point of their beliefs.</p>

<p>I am not sure if the current Flat Earth folks are direct descendants, but I suspect everything has been blended in with trolls and people ironically having fun, and it&#39;s probably very hard to tell who is real and who isn&#39;t.</p>

All our daily existential travel comes from the ability to locate the magnetic north. North pole directly in the center, Antartica is the huge circular edge, everybody going east to west or vice versa goes in a circle. </p>

<p>In the movie (think Independence day, truman show, they live) the entire world grew up conditioned to believe in things they have never seen backed by equations no one has ever checked. (Most people you know don&#39;t understand the math behind black holes, supernovas, planets spinning, endless black space) </p>

<p>In this movie the pinnacle of science basically figured out how to get unlimited funding while basically indoctrinating everybody in a religion that they created (cosmos and spinning planets).  For fans of&quot;  they live&quot; hypothetically if you had the sunglasses on and looked at a picture of the computer composite of earth it would reveal DO NOT QUESTION YOUR HISTORY OR ENVIRONMENT</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The effect described by the holographic principle is independent of consciousness, so it isn&#39;t your mind &quot;tricking&quot; you. Rather, it&#39;s just that the full 3D spatial information  in the universe might be encoded in a 2D surface. It&#39;s more of a proposed unusual property of space on a quantum level rather than something explicitly linked to human perception. And there isn&#39;t exactly overwhelming evidence for it, it&#39;s just an idea that&#39;s attracted a lot of attention because quantum gravity may be easier to describe within such a framework. General relativity still works well on macroscopic scales.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think it’s possible to know whether reality is truly independent of consciousness, because it’s philosophically impossible for an individual to know whether anything is independent of himself. </p>

<p>In other words, I have no way of really objectively knowing that you are not just a vivid hallucination of mine, or that I’m not just a vivid hallucination of yours. Or that we are both just NPC’s in a really good video game. </p>

<p>But. </p>

<p>I’m of the opinion that I’m better off taking your word for it.</p>

<p>That’s really the compelling argument in favor of round earth, or anything else we consider to be objective fact— We’re better off just believing it’s round. In other words— Even if it’s not round, it’s better for us individually to act as though it is, so therefore it might as well be. And if it might as well be round, then it’s effectively round. </p>

<p>Also, he sucks at driving because both vehicles have body damage.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s an entertaining part of our city, unless you&#39;re driving, I guess.</p>

<p>I was listening to him have a polite debate with someone the other day and I felt sorry for him.</p>

<p>His whole identity is wrapped up in FE theory.<br/>
It reminded me of KISS.
When they got famous there had to be a dejected moment when they realized that they would always and forever have to wear that makeup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah so one day I was playing poker at my fraternity house in college. All of the sudden Waka Flocka Flame comes in with a camera crew and asks us if we want to be on his upcoming tv show. The show was about conspiracy theories and was suppose to air on MTV. We were all shocked and giddy to be on the show so we signed the forms and he sat at the table. He asked us what we thought of stuff like the moon landing and 9/11. Then he blatantly said that he was a flat earther and we just like burst out laughing and tried to get him to elaborate. </p>

<p>No idea what’s become of the so called tv show or whatever. I do have a video and maybe it has the quote on it. I’ll have to go check </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>ive never seen such a concerted effort to say Flat Earth theory is fake</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are all sorts of conspiracy theories against all sorts of known facts and just mainstream stories in our world. However, the flat earth conspiracy theory runs against one of the most known facts on the planet: That our planet is in fact a globe.</p>

<p>No other conspiracy theory out there runs against such a massively well known fact. That&#39;s why there&#39;s a lot of backlash to it. That, coupled with the fact that &quot;the earth is flat&quot; was in fact the mainstream accepted idea (when people back then used only simple local observation, and did not know of proper scientific reasoning and experimentation) that baffles the average person of today even more, on how someone in this day and age can latch on this archaic false notion.</p>

<p>These are the top reasons why there are so many is speak out about the flatters and how dumb their ideas are, given what we know in this day and age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly yes. Two of the 10 ish guys I work with are flat earthers. </p>

<p>May explain why they&#39;re working decent, but dead end jobs in their mid 30s and bitter/spitfil towards everyone they work with.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a way to make themselves feel smarter or above those who don&#39;t &quot;know the truth&quot;. Had a few intense arguments when I first started working with them but quickly realized there&#39;s no helping them. Gravity is bullshit, the earth is flat, NASA is a sham, it goes on and it&#39;s fucking embarrassing.</p>

<p>In reality they are both just simple minded dolts with no ambition, and this is what you get from that.</p>

However, I&#39;m not taking the word of people stealing $52 million a day in taxes from us, that &quot;destroyed&quot; the telemetry data to go back to the moon, that only have a little over 500 people claim to go into &quot;space&quot;; 23 of those have actually been to &quot;outer space&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. They exist and aren&#39;t even crazy. Ask them why they believe not what you believe. You&#39;ll get very interesting YouTube&#39;s to watch with lots of historically conspiratorial subject matter. My whole thing with FE is look at the &quot;proof&quot; flat earth believers use and some of it is really weird. Doesn&#39;t have to do with &quot;the earth is legit flat&quot; its usually a video demonstrating nasa using cgi or other nasa fakery. Why would nasa need to lie. Flat earth also kinda jives with another conspiracy &quot;we never left low earth orbit/never went to the moon&quot; which is one I believe wholeheartedly, seeing as the Van Allen radiation belts would have cooked old the armstrong gang. </p>

<p>Always look at &quot;why&quot;. I swear for being a place where we often talk about magic and government supression, flat earth isn&#39;t even that crazy. Holds more water than Katy Benet Ramsey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome thread guys. Very interesting and stimulating reading. TIL at least 1 flat earther has reverted back to sanity snd reason. If there&#39;s 1...then there&#39;s more. Gives me hope. I really looked into the whole FE thing, first out of horror then amusement. As someone who has been interested in astronomy my entire life, as i would look at the sky, i would try visualizing the movements of the sun moon planets and stars to try to understand it. Mind boggling but possible if you do it a lot. I am also fascinated following the changing angles of the sun and changing seasonal hours of daylight. Knowing what i know, FE makes absolutely no sense, but if you are completely ignorant of astronomy, and can&#39;t visualize what you are seeing in the sky in real time to understand it, i could see how someone could be taken in. There are a lot of really good videos debunking FE. You guys are all really awesome...i love reddit!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your question. Gravity is only a theory. In our model the earth is not spinning, but stationary. Buoyancy and density of objects are what makes things fall.In the Round Earth model, terminal velocity happens when the acceleration due to gravity is equal to the acceleration due to drag. In the Flat Earth model, however, there are no balanced forces: terminal velocity happens when the upward acceleration of the person is equal to the upward acceleration of the Earth.</p>

<p>re &#39;gravity is only a theory&#39;, if I throw a ball up in the air it becomes less dense and more buoyant so it goes up, then it gets more dense and less buoyant on the way back down. correct?</p>

<p>What force causes the ball to become more dense and less buoyant at the apex of the ball&#39;s throw so that it descends?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>or is it that because I personally believe in gravity and we as a society collectively believe in gravity that allows gravity to exist as a physical construct? This would be a logical extension of the two slit experiment from physics in which the observers expectation of a light particle being a wave or particle actually influences whether or not it becomes a wave or particle.</p>

<p>However, in ancient times people didnt believe in gravity, yet historical accounts before gravity was discovered do not show there being any difference than today re gravity. At the same time we have geologic and other features on earth that show they have been effected by gravity in roughly the same way for millions if not billions of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think you are missing the point </p>

<p>yes, we know they took liberties with reality in crafting our education. </p>

<p>the reason i am aware of the stories, and the paintings, is because thats what we were taught in school</p>

<p>which is the topic of this article </p>

<p><a href="http://washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/busting-a-myth-about-columbus-and-a-flat-earth/2011/10/10/gIQAXszQaL_blog.html">http://washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/busting-a-myth-about-columbus-and-a-flat-earth/2011/10/10/gIQAXszQaL_blog.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The common man knew the world was round.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if that was the case, how did &quot;flat earth&quot; ever become a thing, in the years after CC? </p>

<p>and why were Columbus and Magellan featured so prominently in our education? </p>

<p>those two men, among others, were used to help craft a narrative about flat earth. </p>

<p>in particular, how CC and FM were the visionary geniuses who knew the earth was round, in an era when the common man believed something else.  </p>

<p>same story with Galileo. GG was a visionary in an era of Artistotle&#39;s dogma. </p>

<p>and Newton...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What perhaps they didn&#39;t understand was how you would stay glued to the &quot;bottom&quot; part of the globe. So a commoner might think, &quot;Hmmm were gonna sail over the curvy part... are we just gonna, &#39;fall off&#39; at some point?</p>

<p>The abrupt &quot;edge&quot; depicted in most of the paintings is a way for the artist to illustrate that notion in the confined space of his canvas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i think my education, in particular, and this lesson, in particular, were crafted as a way to deceive me, not as a way to educate me</p>

<p>i think that those responsible for creating the curriculum for my education must have at some point, after they educated me, decided that teaching this particular lie was not worth it. </p>

<p>i suspect that they noticed that in spite of trying to introduce &quot;flat earth&quot; to young, impressionable minds, they were still introducing the idea to curious, inquisitive minds who might look into it further. </p>

<p>...Conditioned? Just because I dont watch TV and Im not a fan of watching my information means im conditioned? How does that even make sense? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also lots of academics put their presentations on YouTube as I&#39;m sure you know.</p>

<p>Thats fine. I still dont like to watch my media. </p>

<p>Any luck with a paper or written info?</p>
