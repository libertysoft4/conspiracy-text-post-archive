        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are <em>many</em> events Q Anon predicted and has proven his legitimacy time and time again.  But if you&#39;re the type of low level thinker that requires:</p>

<p>Apples = Apples | Los Angeles = Los Angeles</p>

<p>but cannot believe:</p>

<p>[RR-out] = Reference to the Ronald Reagan tweet.  Posted before the tweet.</p>

<p>BDT fireworks = Reference to the Bangladeshi New York subway bomber who thankfully failed at killing anyone.  BDT is the Bangladeshi currency abbreviation.  The post came a day before the event. </p>

<p>then you will not be satisfied with anything Q Anon is saying or is going to say.  These are only two small examples, but the newest wave of Q Anon discrediting post come off like FAKE NEWS cnn spouting about Russiagate.  These post only say Q Anon is bullshit, a LARP, a PSYOP, etc, etc. Q Anon is not here to telegraph the administrations next move, but he or she is keeping the public informed that the administration is in the know, and is winning the war behind the scenes.  If the United States had a real MSM, they&#39;d be covering Q Anon linking timestamped post to POTUS&#39;s tweets, but instead they&#39;re working hard but failing at destroying the POTUS further diminishing their own reputation in the process.  <em>All</em> of MSM (including Fox) are just mouthpieces for the Deep State.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really dislike when people say that. Whenever I had an argument, I presented evidence along with it when I made the claim. You’re the one who wants to stop people from speaking. You can say whatever you want, but until you prove what you claim, you’re the larper, like Q. I’m not going to do research for you. I have more important things to do than substantiate baseless claims and stop free speech. </p>

<p>I’ll summarize this for anyone reading this thread: larper like larpers. Won’t prove his claims that there are hundreds of instances of “Q” spiting truth. Most likely shouts from the rooftops that msm is the devil, yet feeds right from an anonymous teet. </p>

<p>I know all of the “researchers” here have been trained by the highly reputable hacker 4chan, yet a lot of us asking for truth aren’t shills. We are people who have actually spent hundreds of hours researching like adults do. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Add substance, add why you think this whole thing is fake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the whole thing is fake because anyone can claim anything they want to on an anonymous internet message board.  If I were to go on 4chan and say that I was a Trump campaign aide and I had proof of Russian collusion, do you think that this sub would be as receptive to my story as they are Q&#39;s?</p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s fake because the entire narrative that Q presents is a Trump fanboy fantasy in which the President is the heroic protagonist who bravely vanquishes all of his villainous enemies.  Certain posters on this sub are eager to believe and defend it because it falls perfectly in line with their pre-conceived political biases.</p>

<p>Finally, I think that Q is fake because he&#39;s made several predictions that were blatantly, flat-out wrong.  He declared that the Podesta brothers, Huma Abedin, George Soros, etc were going to be arrested months ago and this never came to pass.  Curiously, Q believers seem to avoid discussing this major discrepancy.</p>

<p>Is this enough substance for you?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand the fundamental aspect of Q&#39;s posts.  You don&#39;t just take them at face value.  He never said they would be arrested.  In fact as far as Huma goes, he typed (first name only) HUMA in all caps.  HUMA is the Harvard University Muslim Alumni group...Obama belonged to it.  </p>

<p>As for the others, how do you know they&#39;re not under house arrest?  There are thousands of sealed indictments right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my problem:  We&#39;re backfilling with bias to these Q-anon posts.  Things happen, <em>then</em> we look at Q anon posts and see if any of them fit.  We&#39;re giving no pause to the ones that don&#39;t have an event applied, and we&#39;re ignoring events that don&#39;t fit a Q-anon post.  Top this all off with the <em>vagueness</em> of it all when it comes to the shit he says.  Why?  Why post &quot;BDT fireworks&quot; instead of &quot;A Bangladeshi dude is going to bomb the NYC subway&quot;.  No, instead he puts BDT fireworks because... why?  Is he being charged by the letter to make these posts?</p>

<p>Just one comment that makes us look in a single direction and see an event occur as predicted.  &quot;Hey everyone, look at NYC tomorrow.  Pressure cooker bomb in a taxi.&quot;  Then when it happens he&#39;d be fully legitimized.  But no, all we have is a string of shit words and we&#39;re applying events to them like we&#39;re testing answers in a crossword puzzle.  What&#39;s his game if all of this is legit?</p>

<p>The political enemies of the side of Q Anon are so arrogant they stay in disbelief of Donald J Trump being elected as the 45th President of the United States.  Evidence of this shows in MSM, r/politics, r/worldnews, and other blogs of the like.  I can&#39;t speak for the Q team, but this arrogance is a colossal weakness begging for exploitation and a place you&#39;d want to keep your adversary.  Therefore your messages must be vague, and your enemies will overlook them reinforced with the notion that Q Anon is just a LARP.</p>

<p>Secretly though the Clinton&#39;s, Rothschild&#39;s, Obama&#39;s, and other members of elite are following Q Anon fearing what he might say next IMHO.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist myself and I&#39;m honestly not trying to be rude but I&#39;ve caught myself in this situation many times. It&#39;s human nature to be subjective. When we believe something we seek out all evidence to confirm what we believe and throw out anything that negates what we want believe.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we will invent any excuse to explain away why things don&#39;t make sense. Such as, Q has to be vague so his enemies won&#39;t be on to him or, Q is waiting to release the video as suspense in the public builds. ( since last November) </p>

<p>The NSA metadata collection program collects everything. The NSA employs codebreakers that are smarter than you and I will ever be. If you think Q speaks in code and riddles to fly under the nsa&#39;s radar so that you may receive codes that will take down the deep state maybe it&#39;s time to take a step back and breathe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right; I respect your opinion.  But the point I&#39;m making is not only are there negative post about Q Anon in r/conspiracy, but believers whom post pro-Q comments are being attacked and downvoted.  This is what seems suspect; somewhat coordinated.</p>

People generally listen to insiders because they&#39;re spilling the beans on information that their superiors don&#39;t want released. Q is just telling Trump supporters what they want to hear.</p>

<p>As a long time conspiracy theorist and internet researcher I can assure you that if you want to believe something you will find evidence to support what you want to believe. Even a low-level thinker can play connect the dots and if you look hard enough you will always find dots.</p>

<p>Your condescending attitude is early developed being you&#39;ve only been here since November.  And for you personally to call others (especially those who believe the Q Anon (person or group) is part of a system working to free the minds of the enslaved around the world) low-level thinkers is pathetically ridiculous.

<p>You don&#39;t understand the fundamental aspect of Q&#39;s posts.  You don&#39;t just take them at face value.  He never said they would be arrested.  In fact as far as Huma goes, he typed (first name only) HUMA in all caps.  HUMA is the Harvard University Muslim Alumni group...Obama belonged to it.  </p>

<p>As for the others, how do you know they&#39;re not under house arrest?  There are thousands of sealed indictments right now.</p>
