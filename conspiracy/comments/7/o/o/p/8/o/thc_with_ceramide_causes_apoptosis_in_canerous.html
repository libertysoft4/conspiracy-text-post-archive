<p>When THC connects to the CB1 or CB2 receptors in the cancer cell, it causes an increase in ceramide synthesis that controls against cell death. A normal, healthy cell does not produce ceramide, if the THC is present, and is therefore not affected by the cannabinoid.</p>

<p>The cancer cells die – not because of cell poison – but because a small shift in the cells mitochondria. Mitochondrias are cell’s ‘power center’. quoted from (<a href="https://www.cbdforme.eu/cbd-thc-kills-cancer/">https://www.cbdforme.eu/cbd-thc-kills-cancer/</a>)</p>

<p>chemo is a dangerous method to to rid cancer with horrid side effects and very costly. i hope more research can be done.</p>

Their claim that it was &quot;testing Germ warfare because Russia&quot; sounds more like a standard cover story for a full-on eugenics campaign, or silent war against people they deem &#39;useless eaters&#39;.  Thanks to their studies they learned how to accurately lay out chemtrails to fall where they want the particulates dispersed.

<p>I am a microbiologists / pharmacologists, cancer cells in flasks are very sensitive. The cells essentially are lacking a ton of regulatory feedback, filtration, metabolizing abilities, cofactors from immune cells, ect. It is worth investigating this, however I can assure you that if THC does work as an effective cure in people the major pharmaceutical companies would find the binding region, and modify the side chains to have better pharmacokinetics and sell it under patent. (They have been doing this with Herpes drugs for decades, modifying it slightly to have slightly better pharmacokinetics so they get a new patent). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would buy that it possibly slows/shrinks growth, or somehow inhibits or hinders new growth, allowing your body a better chance at recovery though. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched things like the Rick Simpson documentary, linked below, and there are patients who can attest to being cured. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also people who can attest to be cured from other things as well, like a lady named <a href="https://youtu.be/vwnRMp3JU4c">Sandy Rog</a> who claims she cured herself with &quot;B17.&quot; </p>

<p>The conspiracy that modern cancer treatment is just a way of making money off of euthenasia still stands though.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This, and many types of cancer can be stopped or slowed by shifting into a very strict ketogenic diet. The cancer cells are &quot;stuck&quot; in the fermentation phase, and cannot utilize ketones for energy. Once the body completely switches over to ketosis, the cancer cells won&#39;t have any more sources of energy and begin to die off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typo here..think you meant ceramide induces the apoptosis Cascade, not controls against.</p>

<p>Also be careful about saying something cures cancer just because the mechanism is proven in a cell....10,000 things prevent cause cancer cell death in the lab that don&#39;t go on to have an effect on cancer cells in human body..for every one thing that actually works on human cancer. That&#39;s the main reason that THC/cancer link isn&#39;t investigated heavily, not because of some grand conspiracy</p>
