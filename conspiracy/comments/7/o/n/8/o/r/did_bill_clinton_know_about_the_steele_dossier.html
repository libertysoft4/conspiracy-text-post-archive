<p>Pay to play is the now legal,  but corrupt practice employed by politicians to shake down donors for huge speaking fees,   huge donations,   and other &quot;favors&quot; (bribes) in order for these donors/corporate sponsors to be able to have access to politicians and input into the creation of new legislation.    In other words,  the  rights citizens are supposed to have are being sold off to the highest bidders,  and citizens do not have input.    Citizens United gives &quot;free speech&quot; status to money in politics.</p>

<p>Oh,  bs.    Now you are splitting hairs when we know that either way you say it,  its the same damn thing,   the FBI having a political agenda to stop Trump from interfering in the deep state agenda.    </p>

<p>What really needs exposing is how the US was using ISIS against Assad.    What really needs explaining is how the US has been eliminating secular states in favor of Islamist regimes that are taking over.</p>

<p>Trump needed to have some guidance,  that&#39;s what it came down to.    Lynch and Bill Clinton were seeing to it that it would be there,  whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p>The &quot;insurance policy&quot; was for if Trump got elected, the dossier was released <strong>before</strong> Trump got elected. Their &quot;insurance policy&quot; was plans for keeping the investigation alive after Trump won so he couldn&#39;t just trash it. </p>

<p>What&#39;s wild is how nefarious you believe that is. What would you say if the FBI had plans to protect an investigation into Clinton from a President Clinton, had she won? Would you object with the same scenario if it we&#39;re just reversed? Do you believe a President is above the ability to be investigated for potential crimes? </p>

<p>Its dated a week before the Bill Clinton meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch,  it was commissioned by Bill Clinton&#39;s wife&#39;s campaign,  surely with her knowledge!</p>

<p>I am all for putting Trump in jail,  but these clowns are making a mockery of the justice system,  which is going to come back and haunt all of us.</p>

<p>Also look at the FBI guy that Mueller had to fire because of conflicts of interest.    The credibility of this kangaroo court is laughable,  when the people doing the investigation are so incompetent and such political hacks.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t care,  do you?    Would be fine with Obama or Hillary continuing the genocide and war crimes in your name as long as its Democrats,  huh?    I am done with both corrupt parties.   These needless wars are why there are millions more refugees now than any other time in history including WWII.   Oh,  and what they did to Bernie,  all the pay to play,  what a sham of scum.

<p>They&#39;re two different things. The dossier wasn&#39;t the &quot;insurance policy&quot;. The &quot;insurance policy&quot; was the FBI having plans in place to continue investigating Russia if Trump won and tried to shut them down. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh,  bs.    Now you are splitting hairs when we know that either way you say it,  its the same damn thing,   the FBI having a political agenda to stop Trump from interfering in the deep state agenda.    </p>

<p>What really needs exposing is how the US was using ISIS against Assad.    What really needs explaining is how the US has been eliminating secular states in favor of Islamist regimes that are taking over.</p>

<p>Trump needed to have some guidance,  that&#39;s what it came down to.    Lynch and Bill Clinton were seeing to it that it would be there,  whatever you want to call it.</p>
