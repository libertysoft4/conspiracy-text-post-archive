    <div class="md"><p>I think it has to do with the fact that even just 100 years ago, a food allergy was a death sentence. Modern medical science has allowed those with these allergies to survive and thrive, rather than die when they are children. Same with asthma and other conditions. I&#39;ve had asthma since I was 3, and I damn well know that if I was born 100 years ago I would have died that day when I was 3 years old and I had my first asthma attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve pondered this concept for a bit, and I came to the realization that natural selection actually has a &quot;meta game&quot;. </p>

<p>NS logic follows exactly as you describe. Negative trait kills organism before it can reproduce -&gt; organism doesn&#39;t pass on negative trait. Positive trait allows organism to reproduce better -&gt; trait proliferates. </p>

<p>This system thrived for a very long time, until it produced a being that could &quot;meta game&quot; natural selection. What I mean by that specifically is that if an organism reaches a state of self awareness, it can outright defy natural selection. Food allergy proliferation is a great example. We have developed such an extreme degree of self awareness and ailment avoidance that we are becoming immune to the system that conceived us.</p>

<p>Intelligence isn&#39;t some kind of magical gift; it&#39;s the pinnacle of what natural selection can produce. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was never attempting to present evidence. I was just stating my belief that, if you think about it logically, people with food allergies before modern medicine would have died very young...and often in unexplained (for the times) circumstances. So the natural way of human life would have eliminated these people before they ever became adults, meaning that with modern medical science, we see more of them live into adulthood, and therefore think it is more prevalent, when in the past they would have contributed to the massive amount of childhood deaths. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. One can relatively easily compare people living in &quot;indigenous&quot; conditions vs. &quot;modern&quot; conditions. I&#39;ve seen it in my own family. The previous generation grew up in 3rd world conditions, but were relatively strong and healthy, old folks living to their 90&#39;s. Coincidentally, just as the man came in to vaccinate all the kids, they all came down with terrible allergies and had to move into the city. In the newer generation you see a lot of problems that the older generations didn&#39;t have: crooked teeth, needing glasses, diabetes, chronic skin problems, all kinds of autoimmune problems. The difference is stark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, because that has nothing to do with the fact that indigenous cultures don&#39;t have access to several allergen containing food. If I&#39;m deathly allergic to peanuts but live in a place with no peanuts, then I&#39;ll live my entire life thinking I have no allergies.

<p>I spent a number of years playing in mangrove swamps and estuaries with a lot of of different bacteria that most people aren&#39;t exposed to ever, I very rarely get ill, have no detectable food allergies and my immune system is able to shake off pretty much anything I am exposed to in day to day life.

<blockquote>
<p>The so-called &quot;hygiene hypothesis&quot; quickly took off, but in recent years a growing number of scientists have said the picture is more complex. The rise in allergies and inflammatory diseases may not necessarily be caused by a general lack of microbes in hygienic environments, but rather by a lack of certain organisms that have, over the course of evolution, trained our immune system to be more tolerant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Leaky gut syndrome is a real thing, and it ain’t easy to reverse. I have spent the last two and a half years cleaning up my diet and lifestyle, and after having quit drinking, gone Vegan, stopped eating gluten and legumes, taken daily l-glutamine and probiotic supplements, I’m finally getting back to better health. But I still can’t believe the things that give me trouble these days when I used to just eat whatever whenever, before I had damaged my gut so badly. Oh well, I’m glad I started having health issues because it was the thing that ultimately woke me up and led me down a new path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Similar story here. I use organic bone broths instead of supplementing with glutamine.</p>

<p>Look into methylsulfonylmethane or MSM supplementing to help heal leaky gut. High doses help considerable. Works as a binder for toxins and helps seal the gut.</p>

<p>Look into Spirulina for detoxing as well.</p>

<p>I’m still working on my own GI issues, I’ve also been making progress since trying medicinal mushrooms like Reishi, and lions maine to boost the immune system. Olive leaf and cats claw have been helpful as well. </p>

<p>I think I’ve figured out my GI issues are actually a symptom of Lyme disease.</p>

<p>Anything else helped you recover? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I use spirulina! And I also take chaga mushroom and lions mane. I think the biggest factor has still been food, and focusing mostly on vegetables as main part of diet. No bone broth for my own ethical reasons, but I know it helped my friend tremendously (she is full GAPS diet, and was in a way worse state than me, having suffered from Lyme).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I’ve done GAPS for over a year. It helped a lot, I’ve been able to reintroduce some foods and seem to be handling some carbs again. But still consume organic animal proteins, they’ve been surprisingly healing with all the bone broths. Supplementing just wasn’t the same, as I need the healthy fats and everything else in the broth. </p>

<p>I’ve tried chaga as well but unfortunately it gives me a fever. I know this is a good thing and it means the chaga is working but unfortunately I can’t take it every day. I’m looking into trying a comprehensive immune mushroom blend with low doses of a wide variety of mushrooms. It will probably herx me at first, but if I can tolerate it long term it should help my immune system. </p>

<p>Been taking cordyceps, lions maine, reishi separately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Acid reflux is stomach acid coming up through the pyloric spincter. Leaky gut syndrome is what i have heard people call the chronic inflammatory intestinal permeability associated with a lot of autoimmune conditions.</p>

<p>For &quot;leaky gut&quot;, you would want to take lactobacillus rhamnosus and other human strain probiotics that decrease permeability.</p>

<p>Avoid irritant foods like wheat, soy, too much dairy etc. Dairy can contain a bacterium called MAP(mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis) thought to cause Chrons and inflammatory bowel issues lile &quot;leaky gut&quot;. I put scare quotes around leaky gut because its not really a recognized illness from what i know.</p>

<p>Pathogens to get checked for are MAP or klebselia pneumoniae. Also Epstein Barr virus can cause immune system dysregulation and dysfunction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great summary. It’s not recognized in the same way chronic fatigue wasn’t recognized for thirty years, IMO. Having seen from my own experience my sensitivities get worse, and my symptoms fall right in line with those discussed with leaky gut, it seems to be pretty accurate. I have a friend who spent tens of thousands working with modern medicine only to get diagnosed with three autoimmune diseases. She is finally on the mend after working the last two years with a former surgeon turned functional practitioner who helped her detoxify and rebuild her gut health. Modern medicine did nothing for her, but this guy has saved her life.</p>

<p>For me, I think a number of factors contributed to my health problems. One, I drank heavily in my 20s, combined with lack of sleep and overwork. Two, I had an exercise eating disorder for over a decade which majorly stressed my system. Three, I suffer from recurrent UTIs, which require antibiotics. These bomb out my gut flora and always give me bad side effects, including yeast infections. It’s been one helluva ride getting on top of this, but I’m doing far better now than two years ago.</p>

<p>Even after a year of anti-fungals and an anti-Candida diet I couldn’t get rid of it. Only thing that worked was switching my focus to boosting my immune system with things like reishi mushrooms, olive leaf, cats claw, and breaking up biolfilms with harataki powder.</p>

<p>Once I boosted my immune system my Candida rashes and Candida GI issues including SIBO mostly went away.</p>

After looking at all the different types of filters and softeners i went with a normal but high end charcoal filter as opposed to the bone charcoal type that gets rid of fluoride.

I dont know how much fluoride gets through but its probably reduced enough along with all the other stuff like metals, drugs, microbes.

<p>You don&#39;t need a phd to figure out chlorine is not going to help your gut flora. I used to do road construction and have tapped into many a old water main. These water mains are 80 years old in some areas and are failing. I also know how these municipalities hire people. Usually whole families work for small towns. It is who you know that lands you a nice job for the town. Means having Cletus the yokel dumping fluoride and chlorine into the tanks. Town i live in does an annual water report. For example they test for flouride. The test range is between 1ppm-4ppm. It is always 4ppm, not because it is actually 4ppm fluoride but the test only goes that high so in reality it is way higher. Really fucked up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just wheat either, it&#39;s a crapload of products that have poisons used on them, for example, many root vegetables are sprayed to prevent them from sprouting.  Tomatos are picked green and &quot;ripened&quot; with ethylene gas, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the first place the &quot;food&quot; isn&#39;t what it used to be. Big Agra cultivates for uniformity, maximum water retention, visual appearance, ease of cultivation, harvesting, packaging and a long shelf life and uses various cheap and artificial ways of ensuring that which have all compromised the nutritional value of most of what we&#39;re getting and eating as a consequence. </p>

<p>You may see a lot of obesity but what you&#39;re also seeing at the same time but not recognising for what it is are countless people that are all suffering from malnutrition, over-eating because their bodies are actually starved for vital nutrients they have to eat more in order to try and get them and quell a natural urge that&#39;s beyond their conscious control. </p>

<p>You actually need to consume five ordinary potatoes to get the essential nutrients that one would have easily provided thirty years ago. To get them, however, you also get five times the fat producing starch that happens to come with them. </p>

<p>The same thing goes for most other fruits and vegetables. Not everything in what we eat is good for us and we are unwittingly getting more of that and less of what is good for us on our dinner plates.</p>

<p>We&#39;re dealing with varieties that have been created in a lab to grow in lifeless soil beneath plants that are doused with cheap chemical fertilizers and pesticides. In all truth there&#39;s not much life in them to conceivably give back to us.</p>

<p>The same is true with the mass production of birds and animals for meat that aren&#39;t given anything like a real or natural life to acquire any of the genuine and vital elements of life that they used to normally provide. Pumped full of growth hormones, fed poor and low quality food in cramped and unhealthy conditions that are offset by dosing them with antibiotics to keep them from getting sick before their unnaturally shortened and miserable lives are ended. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t stop there, either, as the meat from them is injected with water and artificial chemical stabilizers to retain it, artificial dyes to enhance it&#39;s color or lack of it and preservatives to give it the longest shelf life possible before it goes &quot;off&quot;.</p>

<p>We&#39;re all being compromised but none as much as the children who were born after that all started to become commonplace. Those of us born before that who grew to adulthood with both better food and a far more active and outdoor life-styles simply have stronger bodies and systems all-round to say nothing of the far fewer vaccines we got and childhood diseases that we did get that gave us a very real immunity to those as well as various other environmental things we&#39;re simply far less susceptible to. We have a natural and lasting resistance to numerous natural things that no artificial means can&#39;t ever match or achieve. It also comes with all kinds of toxins that can create a whole host of unpredictable health problems in and of themselves.</p>

<p>Strictly my opinion, but at the root of the problem is a fundamental disconnect with &quot;life&quot; and any true respect or understanding of what it is and how the &quot;quality of it&quot; must be cultivated and maintained at all levels for it to be had and enjoyed at all levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop drinking tap water for starters. If you must drink tap water let it sit uncovered for 5-7 hours so the chlorine will dissipate.
Whatever you do not let mothers give their infants formula made from tap water. Water that has been filtered with reverse osmosis from my research is the best. I use a Berkley gravity system that has arsenic/flouride/heavy metal filters on it. This not only filters but allows the water to sit long enough to address the chlorine.
Other users here have better information than I but the tap water is goddamned bad. Chlorine will wreak havoc on you.</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>recommenting because I blocked a pain in my rear end and can&#39;t see it anymore. Apologize for doubling up but I think my advice is sound.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because mass produced food is loaded with toxins? Because before they harvest wheat and corn, in particular, they spray it with Roundup (Glyphosate) to kill the plant, thus making it much easier to harvest. Which means we are consuming a dead food laced with poison. Couple this with toxic vaccines, pharmaceutical drugs that create more problems than they supposedly help with, the regular spraying of heavy metals in the atmosphere, ...</p>

<p>Wheat is not inherently bad for us, but this mass produced, low nutrient, harvested dead, and laced with Glyphosate wheat is. It is so nutritionally deficient they have to add nutrients back! It is called &#39;Enriched Flour&#39;, look at an ingredient label of your favorite wheat based product.</p>

<p>Our environment has become toxic. We are largely what we consume. What are you putting in your mouth? And your Mind? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember Michelle Obama&#39;s fitness campaign,&quot;Let&#39;s Move&quot;</p>

<p>It used to be focussed on diet.</p>

<p>The First Ladies whole shtick was eating well and limiting your intake of unhealthy foods. She went on Ellen, Sesame Street, Oprah, and numerous other media outlets advocating for healthy diets.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no coincidence that it didn&#39;t last.
She pissed of major food corporations.
And to no surprise, they &quot;changed her mind&quot;</p>
