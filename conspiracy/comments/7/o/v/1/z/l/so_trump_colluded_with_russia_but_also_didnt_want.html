    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. He just assumed he couldn&#39;t win. Foreign interference insured he did. Why would a &quot;billionaire&quot; ever want to have the responsibility of being President? He lifestyle got flipped around after winning and now he is miserable. If he would have lost, he could be raking in the cash making the media rounds touting the same old fox News bullshit rhetoric that went on the previous 8 years. He can&#39;t quit because it would be admitting another one of his long list of scamming failures of his life. He is a con man, that is all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He colluded because Putin forced him to.</p>

<p>That’s the whole reason you get blackmail, you know? To make people do shit they don’t want to do. You compromise them and use them to your own ends.</p>

<p>Putin wanted sanctions lifted. Putin wanted Trump to win the whole time, evidenced by the stupendously large operation Russia effected upon America and Clinton’s zero percent chance of lifting those sanctions.</p>

<p>Putin did not tell Trump the extent of his attempts to swing the election in Trump’s favor. Putin simultaneously told Trump he’d have access to Russian funds for future business endeavors (the carrot) while guaranteeing Trump could never do business normally again if kompromat was released (the stick).</p>

<p>Putin did not allow Trump to realize he was being played. Putin probably didn’t realize how crazy this election cycle would be.</p>

<p>Putin is generally a master tactician and a poor strategist. Putin didn’t anticipate how incompetent Trump’s people could be, and Putin won’t get his sanctions lifted.</p>

<p>One of the alluring aspects of counterintelligence is that very complex cases can turn on very small, sometimes minute, pieces of information. And years of getting to the bottom of an operation can be swiftly overturned when one tiny—and possibly very inconvenient—fact comes to light. This is particularly a possibility when what exactly happened in a case proves hard to pin down. As most cases involving the Russians are.</p>
