        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: People will disagree. All I ask is that you do so respectfully, for I respect each and every opinion I hear. </p>

<p>Whenever I think of a &quot;revolution,&quot; I think of riots in the streets. I think of angry mobs throwing bricks through windows. I think of militia men coming up from the sewers and shooting guns. But are those days over???</p>

<p>Humanity as we know it is digitalizing all aspects of life. I fear that my generation, as well as the next, is in great danger. Danger of forgetting what life is, and what life is about. Most of us are &quot;safe&quot; in the fact that we won&#39;t get killed by savages. But we aren&#39;t safe from the ever-changing world around us.</p>

<p>On to the title, what kind of revolution will be had? I ask this because of the digitalization of the world. The global dependency on the internet. There is currently a revolution under way, lurking in the shadows of the internet. We the people are assembling against the government on computers and smartphones. </p>

<p>The new revolution will not be fought with guns, explosives, vehicles, gases, or anything of the like. The new revolution will be fought with the corrupt, disgusting evidence of the dirty lives our government officials live. It will be fought with photographs, confession tapes, perfect coincidences. With this exposure of the government, and even the people who run them, there will be death. </p>

<p>If a dirty politician is in danger of being found out, then the people working to save our country will be found, and then lost forever. Mark my words, I believe dark times are coming. </p>

<p>We the people must assemble and overcome. We mustn&#39;t be afraid.</p>

<p>&quot;When government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I completely agree. People need to, almost literally, wake up. It&#39;s just so entirely controlling -- the deception, the delusion, the propaganda, the lies, the enslavement of the mind! -- that I now constantly wonder what what will it take for people on a large scale to realize that their rights are being stolen from them amd it&#39;s entirely up to them to win them back. And what will it take to get us to organize, en masse, and work together in strategy for a <em>hopefully</em> peaceful restoration and protection of our rights. Once the people, who in unity truly wish to be free, regain control of their government, they must maintain control over their government! </p>

<p>I am also guilty of it, and I admire your honesty to admit it, too.</p>

<p>very few on this sub want to take responsibility for their own situation. This is why they blame various boogeymen such as the &#39;illuminati&#39;, the &#39;luciferians&#39;, the &#39;elite&#39;, or whoever. Any group, no matter how little they might know about them, to whom they can shift responsibility.</p>

<p>You are 100% correct, in my opinion. People looking for excuses and boogeymen.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is human nature: few people will ever take responsibility for themselves, and will therefore look for demons/shills/aliens/illuminati to blame instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, but it is not the only way. I would say in my own opinion, but I have experience myself. I’ve never taken a psychedelic drug, unless you consider mdma or thc. </p>

<p>Give psilocybin or lsd a try, see if it does anything for you. </p>

<p>Psychedelics would be great for everyone imo (provided that they&#39;re in a sound mental state), regardless of their predisposition to &quot;thinking outside the box&quot;. But I do agree that it&#39;s a big proposition for a lot of people.</p>

<p>A drug free choice imo would then have to have an impact similar to the shock in consciousness that psychedelics gives for any real change to occur. </p>

<p>It’s all about how each individual experiences life. We truly have no way to express accurately and authentically what’s truly going on inside of our own heads. </p>

<p>That’s part of the unity is knowing that people are going to differentiate lifestyle wise but they still can be equal. For example, yourself and I, we are looking at it little differently, but in grand scheme of it all we have a general understanding still of the root issue.</p>

<p>A Constitutional Convention would be <em>disastrous</em>. Once it convenes, it is out of the control of Congress, the Courts, or anyone else. It is solely in the hands of the State delegations. Could you imagine the army of lobbyists, donors, and special interest hacks that would descend upon such an event? The Republic would be destroyed by whatever &quot;agreement&quot; was reached. Lets just start with enforcing the Constituion we have rather than giving the Elites the perfect opportunity to destroy it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A constitutional convention basically couldnt contain any career politicians, lobbyists, ex Illuminati presidents, or -- quite frankly -- any members of secret societies/mystery schools who have taken secret oaths that could defy in principle the our Constitution, laws, and public proceedings. I agree with you and would much rather prefer a simple restoration of the document, includingthe removal of federal income tax; and ideally ammend some civil rights to the Document. (I&#39;ve always considered adding liberties such as the right to freedom of personal consciousness, or something explicit along those lines that would maybe end the drug wars, torture, and goverment propaganda, or maybe limit lobbying entirely on a federal scale, would be decent topics of discussion in a sane and rational society.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am just incredibly skeptical about the lack of corruption at a Constitutional Convention...like you said, a &quot;sane and rational society&quot;...unfortunately that doesn&#39;t exist in the Republic right now. I just fear that the Elites (the nature of which concerning bloodlines and Magick I agree with you) would find some way to subvert and destroy it. We need to <em>demand</em> our current government actually enforce the Constitution we have rather than give them a chance to destroy it. A Constitutional Convention should be the last, desperate attempt at fixing things imo. </p>
