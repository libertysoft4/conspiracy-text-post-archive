<p>We live in a reality crafted through bullshittery; one scripted deception after another. We are duped by the concept of <em>democracy</em> into choosing between our <em>misleaders</em>, with our votes displaying our <em>devotion</em> to the system of free-ranged slavery. Each face scraped of any sign of individuality, raw to the neck-flesh. Every neck sutured with a suit and tie; the collar and leash we brandish with pride of our slave roles, display our <em>team colours</em>. </p>

<p>This is <em>all bullshit</em> and we <em>all know this</em>. It begins with what we <em>call things</em>, the definitions we accept. We call the <em>misleaders</em> leaders. We call the <em>enemy building the gates</em> big brother. We call the willfully soulless <em>successful</em>. We <em>know</em> this is all bullshit. </p>

<p><a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>, for all it could <em>potentially</em> be, is one institution guilty of gutting itself of any sense of <em>semiotic consonance</em> in the very definitions it accepts. We can begin with the statement of intent of the sub itself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public&#39;s imagination...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a <em>bullshit</em> statement that begins from an emasculated position of uncertainty and subservience. None of the prime topics of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> <em>occur</em> in &quot;the public&#39;s imagination,&quot; but in the very <em>real</em> world that we collectively inhabit. <em>Conspiracies</em> do not concern subjective interpretations on &quot;imagined&quot; events, but concrete malefactions for which we have ample evidence in the public sphere, and yet are never prosecuted or investigated for whatever reason. <em>Conspiracies</em> refer to the conspiracy to maintain the illusion itself, and almost <em>always</em> involve the parties or &quot;authorities&quot; responsible for exposing such misdeeds. </p>

<p><a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> <em>deserves</em> a statement of intent befitting of the goals of <em>exposing the lies and semiotic dissonance</em> at its core. I propose:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <em>inversion</em> that we live within has many lines of defense to maintain it, and many useful idiots who see that it is maintained. <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> is a place <em>designed</em> to be able to discuss and expose the intricate nature of such malefactions, regardless of the perpetrator. In order to create the conditions necessary for the goal of shining a light into all hidden places, respect is expected on all sides of any discussions. Our goals are a fairer, more transparent world and a better future for everyone. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, I feel that all of the <em>rules</em> would be better framed in terms of <em>goals</em> or <em>mission statements</em> that have conditions which provide the grounds of their possibility. I propose:</p>

<ol>
<li>We overstand that we are all in this together, and as such, expect certain community standards that can be summarised by the <em>Golden Rule</em>: Treat others with respect and avoid debates devolving into insults; personal insults or attacks of any variety will not be tolerated.<br/></li>
<li>We overstand that <em>they</em> are <strong>all</strong> corrupt, and we are not interested in your petty professional wrestling. We are interested in shining our light on those <em>behind the curtains</em>, pulling the strings. Partisan political posts will not be tolerated.<br/></li>
<li>We overstand our role – each and every one – in creating the world <em>we want</em>, and we ask the same of everyone who participates in this community. As such, we expect a certain measure of quality of all contributions, explaining your position clearly and without prejudice. Link posts will no longer be accepted without an accompanying submission statement (as per the recent sticky post). We ask that you search for topics before submitting a new post, in an effort to foster debate that will move us all forward. We are all in this together.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately, we need to <em>flip</em> the entire <em>ethos</em> surrounding the idea of <em>conspiracy theorists</em> to one of – not private – but public, open source investigators. This should begin from a position of acknowledging that our <em>regulators</em> and <em>misleaders</em> are simply doing a shit job, and should all be fired (from artillery), and offering specific proofs or indications pertaining to each issue that is being ignored by those whose responsibility it is to address. We begin, instead, from the position of: <em>&quot;Since those in charge of exposing these issues are clearly complicit, if not outright involved, it is up to us as individuals to expose both the crimes and those responsible for covering them up.&quot;</em> </p>

<p>We define what is worthy of public open source investigation based on bipartisan evidence as the first test of legitimacy. 
The second required direction is in <em>tying it all in to the larger picture</em> for others. This would require considered and considerate comments left on every post, explaining the players and history involved, and how this <em>fits into the larger systemic deception</em>. </p>

<p>Example: a user makes a posts concerning narcopharma/poisons in food/makeup/household products. A top comment to this would include a summary of publically recorded legal payouts for victims by the same or related industries (as <em>proof</em> of the legitimacy of the investigations which are being stifled), followed by a summary of <em>why</em> this is being done to people. In this instance, they are <em>knowingly</em> poisoning us with various natural and industrial waste products, with the intent to keep everyone sick for life, with the same families, fraternities, companies and financial interests responsible for both the poison and the &quot;cure.&quot; It does not suit the interests of our misleaders that we are healthy, or of sound body and mind: they wish to keep us sick and confused – just smart enough to make the mcnuggets and just stupid enough to eat them. Another example being that it has been common knowledge since the 1920s that hydrated magnesium silicate (talcum) is <em>always</em> found co-located alongside deposits of asbestos, with the same metamorphic geological conditions necessary for creating <em>both</em> mineral composites, and that virtually <em>all</em> talcum powder and derivative products contain asbestos. </p>

<p>In doing this, we are assisting people in understanding the larger narrative in which these events (these <em>conspiracies</em>) take place within, while simultaneously laying the grounds of expectation for surrounding discourse, and further investigations. The cumulative result would be exposing the <em>grand deception</em> in full, through its pieces. The direction of discourse to follow would naturally call into question the legitimacy of all of our regulators, courts and related institutions, in an exceedingly targeted fashion, whereby people are publically held to account for crimes they have committed. </p>

<p><a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> would (quite quickly) change from a cesspit of bickering and competing voices into a continuously building <em>resource</em> exposing <em>everything</em>.  I admit, this would be a right pain in the arse to do this for every post in /new, but after doing it for even a few days I imagine it will inspire others to begin doing this for themselves, as a part of their OP (and as they understand it). Of course, there will always be differences of opinion as to <em>why</em> things are happening, and even <em>who</em> is really responsible, but this is where we insist on <em>evidence</em> based reasoning, and where partisan political scripts would be obvious and out of place by the very nature of their intentions. </p>

<p>There is a great deal of power in being able to define the narrative and determine the boundaries of discourse; hence why the mind kontrol machine spends so much effort to such ends. Medicine and technology have largely not improved in well over seventy years now because in that time, all legitimate research has been focused solely on various forms of structural-functionalism, social engineering, and the creation of a false and unnatural culture fed to us through militarised propaganda technologies. </p>

<hr/>

<p>The way I see it, we have a choice – each and every one. We <em>always</em> have a choice, in spite of what your <em>misleaders</em> may tell you. For my choice, I&#39;m going to start <em>taking back</em> certain things which have been stripped of me, beginning with accurate definitions of <em>everything</em>. </p>

<p>The reality – unmediated by the influence of attempted thought controllers – is that <em>conspiracies</em> are an intimate aspect of human societies and culture. Every single marital infidelity in human history involves a conspiracy, by definition. The official history that we are fed is itself a litany of conspiracies – of groups and individuals vying for dominance and <em>keeping secrets from one another</em>. To the victor go the spoils, to be sure, but more importantly; to the victor go the story rights – the winner gets to write history. Every detective, every public prosecutor, is by definition a <em>conspiracy theorist</em>, as every investigation of a crime involves the assumption of a cover-up. And somehow we have been led to believe that such <em>secrets and lies</em> are only possible when the stakes are so low. While a man may cheat on his wife, one in office would never betray his nation. While 19 religious zealots with box-cutters, led by a man on dialysis from Afghanistan using a laptop and satellite phone can overpower the largest technological and military force in human history, demolishing three buildings with two aluminium airplanes, the possibility of the largest military force in human history successfully pulling off something <em>similar</em> is simply <em>crazy talk</em>. This is the psychology behind (what has been attributed to Hitler, in the supposedly dictated Mein Kampf, though there is very good reason to doubt the authorship of that particular text; 1925: ch X) what is termed <em>The Big Lie</em> (Große Lüge). <em>The Big Lie</em> suggests that if one is going to lie, that with a &quot;big lie there is always a certain force of credibility,&quot; as for the great masses of the population, &quot;it would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously.&quot; It is easier to believe a big lie than a small one, and it is easier to cope with the idea of a small-time criminal than it is to accept that the real criminals are <em>in charge</em>.    </p>

<p>So I am taking back the term from the <em>misleaders</em> and their theatre. The semiotic dissonance ends here; consider that a threat if it threatens you. <em>Conspiracy</em> is not a dirty word; it is simply the thread that can be pulled to unravel <em>all of it</em>. </p>

<p>So who is with me? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we are going as far as you seem to wish to go (fundamentally questioning language, etc.), then it seems patently obvious that conspiracy needs to create an independent website and forum that is wholly under the control of the collective members of conspiracy. I&#39;m not saying r/conspiracy should be shut down, as it attracts many people from the main site, but a parallel forum where the display and organization of information (ie the language of presentation used in the conspiracy community) is actually controlled by us. Reddit is designed as a click-bait feed-pusher, which is antithetical to organized discussion around topics which seeks to build knowledge. The case of many different threads covering the same ground is a perfect example. </p>

<p>TLDR: r/conspiracy needs to gently pull away from reddit and fully control its means of presentation through a cooperatively run, fully democratic website. Just my two cents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>right</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Logical positivism and logical empiricism, which together formed neopositivism, was a movement in Western philosophy whose central thesis was verificationism, a theory of knowledge which asserted that only statements verifiable through empirical observation are cognitively meaningful. </p>

<p>Logical positivists culled from Ludwig Wittgenstein&#39;s early philosophy of language the verifiability principle or criterion of meaningfulness. As in Ernst Mach&#39;s phenomenalism, whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience,[2] verificationists took all sciences&#39; basic content to be only sensory experience. And some influence came from Percy Bridgman&#39;s musings that others proclaimed as operationalism, whereby a physical theory is understood by what laboratory procedures scientists perform to test its predictions. In verificationism, only the verifiable was scientific, and thus meaningful (or cognitively meaningful), whereas the unverifiable, being unscientific, was meaningless &quot;pseudostatements&quot; (just emotively meaningful). Unscientific discourse, as in ethics and metaphysics, would be unfit for discourse by philosophers, newly tasked to organize knowledge, not develop new knowledge.</p>

<p>can one empirically verify that the past truly occurred? How can one empirically verify that only empirical observations are meaningful? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;can one empirically verify that the past truly occurred?&quot;</p>

<p>Do you mean the past like history or like yesterday? Either way you wade into semantics. Mark your calendar, check it tomorrow, that&#39;s empirical enough for me. As for the story of how we came to be, I take everything with a grain of salt as should any person who truly understands the comings and goings of scientific theory.</p>

<p>&quot;How can one empirically verify that only empirical observations are meaningful?&quot; </p>

<p>You can&#39;t because they&#39;re not the only kind of observations that are meaningful. Even if you get loose with the definition of cognitive. The philosophical elements in the words and definitions you quoted damn near prove my contention in and of themselves.  That&#39;s my opinion anyway, but I had to Google a couple different words before I answered so wtf do I know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, those points go right to the heart of the problem. To be more clear, what I&#39;m <em>not</em> saying is that empirical observations do not or cannot produce knowledge. I <em>am</em> saying that this sort of dogmatic empiricism cannot justify or verify itself and that this must mean that minds are more than bio-processors of empirical data; logical positivism is self-refuting by its own axioms (ie, the points you make in your last two paragraphs). </p>

<p>Or to make this philosophy even more apparently absurd, imagine if someone argued that man has only developed knowledge about mathematics over the millennia through this sort of empirical verification: if it were not written down (or represented through objects, or whatever) would 1+1=2 cease to be true?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly - and that&#39;s just it: setting aside the concept that it objectively occurred whether we know it or not (and the different disciplines that can provide information, like archaeology), is it not true that without historical information we cannot know the past? </p>

<p>This is why some information is occulted, and why we all have a tendency to cling to what information we are given. It&#39;s incredibly intimidating to look out at the vast oceans of information and realize one has to personally analyze it to build real knowledge.</p>

<p>say you want to know what is the most dangerous thing to mankind, and you throw in all these crazy algorithms to figure it out, account for disinfo/fakenews, unverifiable facts, and find the best possible data to support its conclusion. itll spit out X with a billion reasons why. you still need to know all the other possible things it went through to see all of that in context and KNOW: yeah, this thing is fucking right- X is fucking going to kill us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We define what is worthy of public open source investigation based on <strong>bipartisan</strong> evidence as the first test of legitimacy. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure if this was a slip or an intentional use of the word for a certain effect, but to me &quot;bipartisan&quot; implicitly accepts the notion that what both <em>sides</em> of the one party wants or agrees on is good. My experience has been the direct opposite. But if you mean nonpartisan, I think this is a good starting point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The second required direction is in tying it all in to the larger picture for others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is something the sub has been failing to do, and something the submission statements have attempted to address, at least in part. It&#39;s easy to forget that many people reading this sub, and certainly the larger reddit/human community, are not particularly well-versed in the history of conspiracy. When such a person sees an argument or piece of evidence against one person/institution, they implicitly read that as an argument <em>for</em> that person/institution&#39;s chosen (read: controlled) opposition.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t personally subscribe to one of the &quot;single-cabal&quot; theories, its evident that all of <em>this</em> connects and extends both spatially and temporally. And none of us really need to know what the whole puzzle looks like to see what pieces fit in with others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> would (quite quickly) change from a cesspit of bickering and competing voices into a continuously building resource exposing everything. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bickering is killing this sub, choking out any real <em>collaboration</em> towards compiling and documenting the very real crimes and misdeeds that our institutions carry out against the people. It looks like a football game: every time one side has the ball in the other&#39;s territory, that side&#39;s <em>fans</em> (look up the origin of <em>that</em> word) jeer and get positively giddy, while the other side defend these fucks who wouldn&#39;t give any of you the time of day, and certainly don&#39;t care about you or your well-being. It&#39;s dopamine-driven schadenfreude and cortisol-driven Stockholm Syndrome mixed into an orgy of reactive neurochemistry. </p>

<p>Pointing out the bickering only adds to the shitshow, at least within the non-meta threads. Without some direction like you&#39;ve laid out — evidence-based reasoning and connecting dots in a larger picture — we&#39;re always going to be sloshing back and forth in Overton window only barely larger than the mainstream&#39;s. We can&#39;t just call out the partisans and sliders; we need to make the <em>positive</em> arguments, based on evidence, that shows how all these people, organizations, and events intertwine.</p>

<p>T_D folks arent too bad. They came here because they literally witnessed a shit ton of conspiracies come true just before their eyes, plus Alex Jones was on board.</p>

<p>In my exchanges, they have been not too bad. On the other hand, the influx from r/politics the last month or so has been strange AF because they usually see us as tinfoil nutters and brush us off. So its definitely felt like some sort of concerted brigade.</p>

If anyone actually read the post, it pretty much read like <a href="/u/Putin_loves_cats">/u/Putin_loves_cats</a> paraphrased. People were making threads left and right, thinking it was an admin action, and he made that post (and those of us online agreed) to let them know that we have very different rules here.</p>

<p>Also, T_D had been in this sub (as had the other side) long before he made that post. I doubt that post had any appreciable effect on the number of T_D users here, certainly not any more than T_D going private did anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; &#39;The second required direction is in tying it all in to the larger picture for others.&#39; </p>

<p>&quot;This is something the sub has been failing to do, and something the submission statements have attempted to address, at least in part. It&#39;s easy to forget that many people reading this sub, and certainly the larger reddit/human community, are not particularly well-versed in the history of conspiracy.&quot; </p>

<p>Then this will include the &quot;reminder&quot; posts that so many like to put up. They&#39;re great for reminding people, countering the memory hole and putting it out there for noobs. But they are very often partisan. It&#39;s the old dig of &quot;whataboutism&quot; which I think is an overused criticism anyway. But often times someone sees a headline, &quot;Politician A lied to congress&quot; or &quot;Politician B is running for re-election,&quot; which is invariably followed by a reminder of this person&#39;s past transgressions. These posts will always be viewed as partisan. You can&#39;t force people to be non-partisan or even to limit them to arguing from a non-partisan view. It&#39;s not gonna happen and it&#39;s too stifling, it eats at discussion. I think you agree with me when you say:</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s easy to forget that many people reading this sub, and certainly the larger reddit/human community, are not particularly well-versed in the history of conspiracy. When such a person sees an argument or piece of evidence against one person/institution, they implicitly read that as an argument for that person/institution&#39;s chosen (read: controlled) opposition.&quot;</p>

<p>So do you want to allow new eyes in the sub and new voices to the discussion or limit it to old salty dogs who have agreed not to argue from a partisan viewpoint? </p>

<p>In <em>1984</em>, Orwell wrote explicitly about fake wars and even fake military technology. Many people on this sub reference <em>1984</em> and seem to want others to believe that they have read the book. If this is so, why do so few people on this sub discuss the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad1iCYcdyiM">absurd images</a> we are shown by our telescreens about &#39;war&#39; and &#39;military technology&#39; <em>today?</em></p>

If the force of the propellant exceeds the force of gravity, what the fuck need is there for lift? They are firing a missile from an aerial vehicle down to the ground.

<p>Most of the people who talk about <em>1984</em>, I can tell they either haven&#39;t read the book, or were only flipping through the pages when they &#39;read&#39; it. Orwell explained so much of what is going on today (and was going on then), but all people ever seem to talk about is the trivial stuff like &#39;Big Brother&#39; or &#39;surveillance&#39;.</p>

The connection I mostly make is the concept of newspeak--except that internet newspeak was created semi-socially for convenience. Part of me believes that language is devolving by design though---From Adbusters Magazine: &quot;Klemperer describes the language of the Third Reich as no longer drawing a distinction between spoken and written language. Everything was “oration … exhortation, invective.” Fanaticism became a virtue. We can see this same kind of blurring happening today, but the arena has changed from rallies and talk shows to—where else? —the Internet.&quot;</p>

<p>Edit: if you supply sufficient thrust you only would need to steer the object in the direction you desired. I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s why they only have fins in the back. I&#39;m also going to go out on a limb and say the fins near the center of gravity or near the &#39;head&#39; of some of those other missiles are not for generating lift but for adding control surfaces. Those missiles may need to make more precise maneuvers to hit their target (planes, vehicles, etc), where the missiles with only read fins may be directed at stationary targets. I don&#39;t know anything about what missiles are used for what and what they look like.. but I know a bit about aerodynamics and flying. The canard fins add a great deal of maneuverability to a rocket or even plane. </p>

<p>What disturbs me with this explanation is that the air flow would then cause the upward-pointing tip to point even more upwards, and eventually the missile to rotate upwards out of position.

<p>Try to draw a vector diagram where this could possibly work.

<p>In other words, if that is the <em>best</em> attempt at an explanation the commenters can come up with, then thousands of viewers have been bamboozled by this video.</p>

<p>Which is no surprise to me because I suspect that Orwell was telling us the truth.</p>

<p>You&#39;re forgetting to account for the thrust vector of the rocket motor.</p>

<p>Back fins create drag, which causes the nose of the rocket to tilt up.</p>

<p>This the drag-induced rotation of the rocket&#39;s thrust vector away from perpendicular with respect to gravity introduces a vertical component to your thrust vector.</p>

<p>It is this y-component in the thrust vector that overcomes the force of gravity and obviates the need for dynamic lift. No need to generate lift because the rocket motor is literally pushing you up.</p>

<p>The tricky bit is balancing/trimming the missile so that the drag induces just enough rotation that the y-component of the thrust vector exactly cancels out acceleration due to gravity. That&#39;s what aerospace engineers are for.  </p>

<p>Because of where the rocket motor is located in relation to the missile&#39;s center of mass and because it is providing continuous acceleration, a rotation is produced that counters the drag-induced rotation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just about getting your vectors to cancel such that the y-component of the thrust vector cancels gravity while the acceleration induced-rotation cancels the drag-induced rotation and produces level flight. It&#39;s fiddly, but not at all mysterious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You want me to directly attack the video itself instead of arguing against your defense of it, hm? Ok.</p>

<p>The video&#39;s entire premise is &quot;many missile designs shouldn&#39;t get enough lift from their wings/fins to fly.&quot; The video is correct in this, they don&#39;t. Nearly none of them do, including the ones that he thinks may actually be to do so. Any lift they manage to provide is just a bonus, though a helpful one that makes the missiles job much easier.</p>

<p>The purpose of the fins is much more akin to the feathers on an arrow then the wings on a plane. The feathers don&#39;t keep the arrow in the air, they keep the arrow facing the same direction that it is moving, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The actual reason missiles &quot;fly&quot; is because of the fact, as a previous person mentioned, that they can produce more much, much more thrust than their weight and they can either rotate themselves either using control surfaces or thrust vectoring (Most use the latter) to point above the horizon enough so that the vertical component of their thrust is greater than their weight.</p>

<p>The only other hurdle in the video is his claim that using thrust vectoring to point the missile upwards will cause the engine to actually push the missile down towards the ground. The amount a missile can actually &quot;vector&quot; is generally less then 10 degrees, which means that if you pitch more then 10 degrees, or however much you&#39;re vectoring above the horizon you&#39;ll no longer be technically thrusting toward the ground.</p>

<p>The only other thing I&#39;d like to mention is that he&#39;s concerned with the fact that the center of lift is behind the center of gravity, but that&#39;s actually true of many aircraft, as it promotes stability. It does indeed tilt the aircraft downward, but the increased stability resists this downward turning at the same time, making just a tiny bit of upward steering required to compensate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>he explains the answer to his question with thrust vectors coming out of the back. that totally explains how they fly through the air. you dont need them to fucking break the heliosphere and go into space. theyre not designed to have crazy ass lift. just enough to hit another plane within, say, 1 mile above their plane.</p>

<p>the idiom goes: well, it isnt rocket science.</p>

<p>such a phrase exists for a reason. there a lot of factors and math that goes into these things. they are not easily explained, or understood in a 17 minute video.</p>

<p>imma try to explain this as best i can, i dont know if its right, but, im no rocket scientist either.</p>

<p>imagine youre holding a hose and water is coming out. it has decent force, propelling each water molecule out of the end of the hose.</p>

<p>you see your friend walking nearby. you want to spray them, but damnit, the water wont reach them with the tiny amount of force it comes out.</p>

<p>so what do you do? you apply a force vector, to the water coming out of the tube, with your thumb.</p>

<p>this changes the force behind the water molecules from straight (assuming you are holding the hose parallel to the ground) to a more arched path. go try it outside if you want.</p>

<p>sure, the smaller opening creates more force and that helps as well, but, watch the water. it will show more arch than before.</p>

<p>missile is kinda reverse of this, but the same theories apply.</p>

<p>plus, he readily admits that the weight probably isnt dead center in the missile, but then throughout the rest of the video he ignores this.</p>

<p>i always love new ideas, and thank you for sharing this one. it was cool to learn about missiles and how they work. this guy is wrong tho. i dont think he truly understands how physics works. this is how we get flat earthers lol. learn more, do more math, experiment yourself. youll find the truth better that way anyway.</p>

<p>btw, if this guy really wanted to prove it, he could go to walmart and buy some bottle rockets. he could weight them at various points to prove his theories, and, mess with the fins on the back as well. i think hed see that he is wrong.</p>

<p>lastly, i do totally agree that blue beam and other things prove that there is some exaggeration to certain military technology. that said, remember that keep all the good new tech to themselves. we are probably a good 50 years behind the best and baddest stuff they have. remember gps? they had that shit for fucking years and years. we use that shit every day. the blackbird was made in the 50s, but kept secret until the 80s (or whenever they released it). technology growth is also not a straight line, but a parabolic curve. so, if they were 10 years ahead in the 40&#39;s, theyre at least 50 years ahead now. at least.</p>

<p>PS. thank you for sharing this video, and i do think that guy did a good amount of research. he just doesnt quite get how it works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can easily make a bottle rocket that goes up. It isn&#39;t so easy when you want something that can stand being shot out of a airplane at mach speeds, add further speed, and still accurately hit another vehicle more than a mile away going at a different mach speed. Tons of math, both straight physics and material sciences (the drag and the propellant creates heat that makes various components of the rocket slightly change shape or size).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i really liked my water analogy. if that doesnt make sense, idk how to help you. thats just for force vectors tho, not rocket science as a whole. remember tho, force vectors and not weighted at the center totally make his arguments null.</p>

<p>the deal with bottle rockets (they dont use water btw) is that you can see that IRL, and you dont need all the math and things that BETTER explain how these rockets work. you can just go fuck with them IRL and tweak what you want.</p>

<p>like putting the weight in the middle, or putting it in the back. IIRC, theyre totally back weighted tho. just like those missiles!</p>

<p>oh, and for the record, i never said it was too complicated to understand. i understand some basics, but we didnt even bring up atmospheric pressure, or wind shear, or how the weight changes as fuel is expelled... etc etc.</p>

<p>so yeah, maybe too complicated for you and that guy who made that video, but NASA, and space X and all those guys totally do it every day.</p>

I didn&#39;t watch the entire video you linked, but it seemed to be focusing on center of gravity and the aeronautics of missile flight. I get that these concepts may be difficult to wrap one&#39;s head around, but the core concepts of missile flight are the same concepts involved with launching an arrow. Maybe I&#39;m missing something, but I really don&#39;t see anything impossible about missiles, seeing as we&#39;ve been launching them for 10,000 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Arrows do not generate lift</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well for one, yes they do. It&#39;s a very small amount of lift, but the surface area of the shaft does generate lift. But this is beside the point. Arrows and missiles don&#39;t need to generate lift. Rocks don&#39;t generate lift, but they can be thrown really far and launched using machines even further. The initial thrust gives the object the force needed to overcome gravity. A missile has an engine which delivers sustained force. This force is enough to defeat gravity, the missile trades downward force for forward momentum. So there is no need to generate lift. The little wings on missiles are not wings at all, they are canards</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canard_(aeronautics)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canard_(aeronautics)</a></p>

<p>They are used for control and stability not lift. Exactly the same as arrows, the feathers are not used to generate lift, they&#39;re used for stability. </p>

<p>Indeed these two propositions are not mutually exclusive. A great many scientists were platonists. Look into the Kybalion and the hermetic paradox if you&#39;re interested. And finally here is something you might find interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about the atoms this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together [...] We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Spirit. This Spirit is the matrix of all matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m bothering with you, but I&#39;m hooked now, and I think I can prove it to you. </p>

<p>If you seriously want to understand this concept just do this experiment with me. </p>

<p>Get a standard piece of paper. 
stand up to where you can move around in your room.
drop the paper to the floor. </p>

<p>Observe that gravity has overcome the paper and it drops to the ground freely. </p>

<p>Ok now pick the paper up again.
Place your right hand out flat as if your telling someone to stop, the tips of your fingers should be pointed straight up. 
With your other hand place the paper flat against your right hand, not on top of your hand, but flat against your open palm. </p>

<p>Now at the same time, begin to turn in place, not walking in a circle, but rapidly turn your whole body in a tight circle.</p>

<p>I realize that these are not the best instructions, but if your doing it right then the paper will stay flat against your hand and it wont fall to the ground. There is NO lift being generated by anything involved, and yet the paper is held up against your hand, partially by wind resistance, but also by the force of your hand BEHIND the paper. Now imagine that your hand is a rocket engine. Your hand is pushing the paper through the air without holding it up, the rocket engine is doing the same thing. The real life missile is being rapidly pushed trough the air, without the need to generate lift. </p>

<p>I know it seems silly, but seriously, stand up and try it. There&#39;s at least 4 other people in this thread telling you that the video you linked to is wrong, and trying to explain this concept to you, many of us are having difficulty explaining it, because it&#39;s not something very many people have to deal with. But I promise you that Missiles are real, and they fly through the air without wings. </p>

<p>Uh, do you mean to tell me you don&#39;t understand the physics of... missiles? I figured this would be military laser defense weapons or Gauss turrets or something. Missiles are proven physics. They&#39;re rockets designed to detonate. They don&#39;t need much lift surface because of their tremendous speed and low drag coefficient. </p>

<p>Edit: Before I get the &quot;Real missiles would look like airplanes.&quot; argument, missiles are basically like self powered bullets. Have you seen a bullet fly? It works pretty well without any type of wing. Missiles work on a similar principle but employ engine thrust and something known as <em>thrust vectoring</em> in order to maintain constant speed and stability. </p>

<p>Absolutely false. Perfect example of a bullet that does not &quot;drop&quot; out of the barrel is the 223/5.56 round. First 100 yards it actually hits higher than point of aim before dropping: <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XvtsqAx8TQs/UiDAAs5s9OI/AAAAAAAABZQ/Tz6A7OSmaeg/s1600/Zero1.png">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XvtsqAx8TQs/UiDAAs5s9OI/AAAAAAAABZQ/Tz6A7OSmaeg/s1600/Zero1.png</a></p>

Because, after reading your entire missile thread, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re a real live living breathing functional adult who is being serious right now. I agree with the guy above, I almost certainly thought you were going to point to the new gauss cannons on our latest greatest navel destroyer or the sniper rifles that can shoot accurately over multiple miles, not something as simple and well understood as a missile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry man, that video you linked is garbage and I&#39;ll say why.  Missiles aren&#39;t designed to stay in the sky forever, they are long range HUGE bullets.  He keeps pointing to an airplane, something that has continued use in and out of flight, to something that is designed for a one way trip.   </p>

<p>Also, at 11:30 he says that some rockets have vector thrusts which is true, but he fails to understand that a missile is traveling MUCH faster than an airplane, so even if it was using vector thrust it would still gain upward momentum.  It&#39;s the same reason you can pop a wheelie and then pop another one when you&#39;re close to returning to the ground from the first one.   </p>

<p>Some  strategists  are  concerned  that  seaborne  robotic swarms  might  do  the  same  thing  for  enemy  nuclear  submarines  by  allowing  states  to  more readily  track  and  target  their  movements. If  any  of  these  threats  materialised,  states  would face  severe  use-or-lose  incentives.  But,  even  if  they  did  not  materialise,  the  very  possibility  that they  seemed  likely  to  could  cause  states  to  undertake  destabilising  action,  such  as  heightening alert  statuses  or  delegating  nuclear  launch  authority.  This  theme  –  that  a  threat  need  not materialise  for  it  to  be  destabilising  –  is  true  for  all  the  technologies  discussed  here.  As  long  as  a state  perceives  itself  to  be  under  threat  –  whether  it  is  or  not  –  it  may  be  incentivised  to  behave in destabilising ways. </p>

<p>I have time now, r-e-l-a-x. Going through the OP, still could have cut everything down to 3-4 sentences. Also, I was the nice guy and and put you onto to r/C_S_T where folks there regularly write novels about a topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This and these discussions are similar to that which I used to drag my friends through. My friends are not especially gullible fools but they are skeptical. After all when we&#39;re taught the belief system of the material science it&#39;s  hard to recognize that actual real magik has been mobilized in maliciously intented plans to keep us from owning our own intrinsic glory...
Things have changed though.  Enough that the control systems have been rattled and their flaws exposed.  Last election in particular demonstrated especially to the Bernie/Jill crowds just how, and just how much the supposed most important office and the competition to it is a puppet show, and how when <em>they</em> select their candidate they will go to extreme lengths, under all of our noses to make sure their will is done. 
If anyone feels the need to interject &quot;There you have befooled!! For it was Hitlary that <em>they</em> chose!&quot; To that I assure, they are the same.  She has better education but the masters don&#39;t change. I might suggest tbe only risk Trump personally poses the &quot;big 150&quot; is that he might struggle to read the sript they had prepared for him or say too much during some off script performance.
These days my allies too are wary of the narritives spat out by the news, they too question why certain symbols and suggestions hit the pop culture at curated times.
With each passing day the cracks are revealed and hidden,  revealed and hidden.  All it really takes now is to pay attention, people will wake up faster now than ever.
We are all connected in this.
It is my sincere belief that the future </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The march towards &quot;freedom&quot; or emancipation for the &quot;common person&quot; is a long road fraught with potholes.  That which constitutes frredom for one individual, will lay the foundations for anothers prison cell.</p>

<p>Gloucestershire is just an illusion.</p>

<p>To talk today as if the majority of individuals in the western world and beyyyyyoooond are no more than wage slaves is an insult to those in the past who have stood up to demand the right to representation.</p>

<p>It is the sound of privilege wetting a bed.</p>

<p>Reality is what you can get away with.</p>

<p>Whilst of course we are all prone to be buffeted by the waves of socio-political forces that course through our communities, we alone have the power to make own worlds as free or as helpless as we wish.</p>

<p>I suggest giving up all your possessions and going to live in a community with little material wealth whose language you do not speak.</p>

<p>Perhaps then, you will find what it is that truly enslaves us, and in relief, discover also that which sets us free.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we need to flip the entire ethos surrounding the idea of conspiracy theorists to one of – not private – but public, open source investigators. This should begin from a position of acknowledging that our regulators and misleaders are simply doing a shit job, and should all be fired (from artillery), and offering specific proofs or indications pertaining to each issue that is being ignored by those whose responsibility it is to address. We begin, instead, from the position of: &quot;Since those in charge of exposing these issues are clearly complicit, if not outright involved, it is up to us as individuals to expose both the crimes and those responsible for covering them up.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with some of what you said in spirit, and all do respect to a well written and thought out post, but you are being a touch too authoritarian. Take rule #2:</p>

<p>&quot;We overstand that they are all corrupt, and we are not interested in your petty professional wrestling. We are interested in shining our light on those behind the curtains, pulling the strings. Partisan political posts will not be tolerated.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;overstand&quot; or how it might relate to a requirement for submissions and posting, but I for one, do not think &quot;they&quot; are all corrupt, just mostly. I also try to be independent and non-partisan, but that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t want to hear somebody else&#39;s partisan arguments, especially if they are well thought out and polite. People ally themselves with political parties because they feel those parties represent them overall better than the others. If they are making a good point, I want to hear it, if not, especially if they are spewing brainwashed bullshit, I want a chance to tear into their contentions. I personally care little for changing the opinions of &quot;normies&quot; but if you do, you&#39;re gonna have to let them have their say and their counterarguments.  If that means putting up with shills and brainwashed mainstream assholes then so be it, let the best theories win, shine that light. Otherwise I welcome &quot;normies&quot; to the conversation and I do not expect them to be anything other than mainstream. I don&#39;t go to other subs looking to &quot;redpill&quot; ppl. Tried once or twice maybe, fuck that, let them come here and join in and we&#39;ll see what they are made of. But I don&#39;t think you can have it both ways, either allow partisan arguments or concede you will turn-off a lot of potential n00bs by disallowing it.</p>

<p>Free speech and no censorship in spirit...taking down the most egregiously offensive posts in practice.</p>

<p>Otherwise, develop your built in filter and if somebody does say something you don&#39;t like either argue against it or down-vote and move on.</p>

<p>I do want to limit spam, as with the new submission statement rule.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should explain exactly what is meant by &quot;partisan political posts.&quot; Does that only include US politics? For example there are a whole lot of partisan political posts and fabricated titles here clearly in support of the arab/Palestinian movement and against Israel. </p>

<p>Overall, I don&#39;t see this as a real improvement. There still is <em>no community</em> because of a lack of any knowable objective values. Accounts are going to continue shilling and dissenting opinions are going to keep being trolled and buried. </p>

<p>My suggestion would be for respected users of the sub to participate in crafting a statement of beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a fan of ppl intentionally using words like &#39;semiotic dissonance&#39; that they know most ppl will have to look up without explaining it in the post. The English language has things called synonyms and metaphors to make language accessible and precise without having to do that.</p>

<p>heres an example:</p>

<p>semiotic dissonance= when you are told an apple is an orange and u believe the apple is an orange</p>

<p>I speak Chinese and Spanish in addition to my native English. I dont post in Chinese on reddit. That would be stupid. could go into a much longer rant here about how the problem is ppl have been programmed to expect politicians, business leaders, and public communications to always be producing &#39;polished turds&#39;  in their speech and behavior that have the perfect vocabulary and sound professional, however, when u look into the substance, is 90% bullshit. This is pure social conditioning. Happens in many cultures. </p>

<p>Interestingly there are a lot of studies about how class and language are used in the US. Basically insecure ppl trying to move up in social class intentionally use language others wont understand the most.</p>

<p>response to points made in the post:</p>

<ol>
<li> &#39;Consider it a threat if it threatens you&#39; </li>
</ol>

<p>got to be really careful with this one. Ppl have to have a high level of self understanding to truly understand if something is threatening them.</p>

<p>-Some one saying you are wrong is not a threat.</p>

<p>-Some one who does not like you is not a threat.</p>

<p>-some one who is prettier or smarter than you is not a threat.</p>

<p>-some one who says u r wrong because their facts are different than your facts is not a threat</p>

<p>-some one who unintentionally makes you look bad is not a threat</p>

<p>The above may seem super obvious but, if you have really invested time in understanding yourself, you definitely know how often petty motivations can creep into our consciousness without you being aware of it. That said, fear of not fully understanding your own inner motivations should not ever silence you. Way better to be wrong on interpreting something you are feeling than to just go along with what everyone else is beleiving and saying as chances are that is even more wrong.</p>

<p>Humans are all logical and emotional beings. Emotions provide access to the most powerful of internal in sights in the form of intuition. THIS SHOULD NOT EVER BE DISCREDITED. Logic allows us to connect the two things together. intuition sets the direction, logical research builds the framework.</p>

<p>One of the biggest lies being fed to us is that emotional truths are lies. Actual powerful intuitive insights have mistakenly been grouped together with petty emotional responses.  The two are very different, but it is hard to tell the difference within yourself and in others without a considerable amount of training.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>an emotional truth is an ineffable truth that taps into your deeper subconscious knowledge. Additionally, If you believe in stuff like remote viewing as I do, it would also mean insights extracted through meditation or other method of focusing at targets.</p>

<p>emotional response would include social emotions like anger, fear, jealousy, pity, compassion that motivate your actions. At the same time, however, emotional response can also be emotional truths. The trick is gaining enough self understanding so you can learn to tell the difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a website that is filled with people that many times have very little contact with the conspiracy world or any topic deemed too fringe by the mainstream narrative. </p>

<p>Of course many other places exist where one can talk about conspiracies, fringe subjects,...etc., even many smaller subs on this site. However r/conspiracy is a unique way to spread awareness about issues that matter. And if this can be done in a well argumented, detailed and concise, yet still easy to understand way, those unaware could be &quot;red-pilled&quot; so to speak, which could make a more significant difference than people with knowledge of topics not covered in the mainstream  (conspiracies...) remaining only in closed off and unknown subs, groups and sites.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my take on it anyway.</p>

<p>But yes, the brainstorming and researching should perhaps mostly be done off-site and in the smaller subs on specific topics. But it should always be presented here as well, since this place has a lot of eyes on it (which is why various provocateurs are so rampant here).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I know this isn&#39;t going to be popular, but there is no way to fix conspiracy. Everyone seems to think it is only outside pressure that fucks this sub. It&#39;s not, a great deal of the stupidity is caused by the people that post the most. They use alt accounts and proxies. Happens on every single conspiracy site, I used to run one of the early ones and while it didn&#39;t see the numbers some places see (less people on the net back then) I saw it happen there and some of the sysops of contemporary sites admit this as well.</p>

<p>Conspiracies attract nutters, sorry but that&#39;s the truth. No not everyone here by far is a nutter, but it only takes a motivated few percentage points worth to mess it up completely.</p>

<p>AND then you add the outside pressures.</p>

<p>There is nothing to fix, you live in the information age, if you cannot navigate for information with EVERYONE else trying to obfuscate, then you are lost already.</p>

<p>Everything is simply data, some is not true, some is, but it is all data and when they lie they reveal important things about themselves. Learn to rise above the argument and become competent in the information age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, the key is not to believe anything. Just accept it as data, eventually that data will correlate with other things and become useful to you, or it won&#39;t. We cannot be lazy anymore, gone is the false dependence we had on institutions we could &quot;trust&quot;. Now we have to think for ourselves.</p>

<p>Communication used to be very, very costly and time consuming. Books used to be only affordable by the aristocracy. When communication is so expensive the demand is for the highest quality information possible. </p>

<p>Now communication is accessible and so cheap most don&#39;t even consider the cost. This drastically changes the signal to noise ratio. There is no way to fix this as it is not broken. It&#39;s billions of people expressing themselves and people trying to get ahead by marketing, lying (but I repeat myself), obfuscating etc. Get enough people to agree and you have some power, many people seek power.</p>

<p>The main information that really ground this into my mind was just looking at ancient history and looking at modern events. Nothing has changed and it has not changed because human nature has not changed and will not just because we think we&#39;re all advanced. We&#39;re just a very successful omnivorous predator, a killer ape. No more, no less. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting you (inclusive) don&#39;t dig and learn. If that is what motivates you, then do it. Just my two cents worth after decades of digging ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you fix it with education. if someone posts something factually wrong, you take the time to correct them. like i attempted to do with the missile guy above.</p>

<p>another guy that posted above said something like: remember when this place wasnt just baiting?</p>

<p>the problem isnt just this place, or its education level. its with the whole of society. when fucking jersey shore is the news (lupe!) no one wins. society is now focused on clicks, bait to get those clicks.</p>

<p>just because the problem is daunting, doesnt mean we shouldnt try our best to wake up every single person we can.</p>

<p>the cool thing is: if theyre on this site, they already recognize there is something wrong with the world. thats seriously like 75 percent of the battle. the problem with bait is that people fucking like it! so if you get a rat that sees the cheese and says: wait a minute, that shit isnt right. pounce on that fucker and try to get them to see the light. theyre almost there anyway.</p>

<p>now, people with mental illnesses do exist. one of the unintended consequences of the internet is that these people get a chance to connect wayyyyy more than they normally would have in the past. so they can influence each other, and, wreak havoc for sure.</p>

<p>but, sane people can totally recognize crazies. i do it every day at work, if you work with people at all, you can as well. some people you can know that you just cant save. no matter what.</p>

<p>as far as society goes, i think there is rehab or a pasture environment would be best; but, that wont work on here. you do the best you can until you realize its a crazy. once identified, you try your best to educate and sway them. if it takes too long, or is too trying, let it go.</p>

<p>theyre the crazy. you and everyone else, that is sane, knows you are sane. its all good. cant win them all. duality and such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well put, balanced approach.  I left a cult some years ago and have dealt with the repercussions of my family looking down on me, thinking I&#39;m a stupid idiot and deceived by the devil, etc.  I wanted so badly for them to wake up and see that they are the ones in a mental prison, but finally I&#39;ve come to a place of acceptance, more or less, that they are on their journey and I can&#39;t really do much to change that.  </p>

<p>And now I just see that as a microcosm of society at large, so many of us are in a dream state, walking around half asleep, believing that the construct which has been given to us is &quot;reality&quot;.  Everyone is somewhere along the continuum between fully asleep and fully awake.  I feel as though I&#39;m closer to awake than others, but I&#39;m not so proud as to think I have it all figured out, far from it actually.  And, I hope that I can help others along the way, if by nothing else but living as authentically and honestly as I am capable of at any given point, and sharing what I know when given the chance.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re splitting a lot of hairs man.</p>

<p>For the first part, it doesn&#39;t sound like you&#39;re wanting a solution. All we can do is lead the horses to water; we can&#39;t make them drink.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say: keep going till they believe it as the one truth. I implied: do your best, throw out truth, whatever happens after that is up to them.</p>

<p>To your last point, for sure. There are some impressive crazies. Psychology/psychiatry in general is pretty subjective.</p>

<p>That said, there are things that are facts. Proven science. If people can&#39;t deal with that, then they&#39;re crazy. It&#39;s pretty simple. I&#39;m not saying fucking diagnose them. &quot;You&#39;re sociopath!&quot; It&#39;s more like: know when you&#39;re fighting an un winnable battle and move on.</p>

<p>Lastly, I work in the medical field. I didn&#39;t believe this for the longest time, but, it&#39;s totally a real thing. You can sense all kinds of things about people. Craziness is one of them. Sure, there are those that slip through, but, for the majority of people: you can tell. You may not be able to say,&quot;oh, they&#39;re bipolar.&quot; But you can tell they &quot;aren&#39;t quite right.&quot; However, there isn&#39;t science for it. Rather, there&#39;s &quot;pseudoscience&quot; that provides answers, but, nothing that any random physics professor would approve. For the record tho, I was totally with you. I called bullshit on my gf. Then I got into the field myself, and, sonofabitch, she was right.</p>

That is one thing I wish newcomers could understand, disinfo is 95%+ correct. if it wasn&#39;t it wouldn&#39;t do them any good as propaganda. First they need enough stuff panning out that people say, &quot;Hey this person really knows their stuff!&quot;. Then when is suits they chuck in a bit of disinfo and it gets gobbled right down.

    <div class="md"><p>I love everything you&#39;ve said, but face it, this sub is dead and it was doomed from the start. Reddit&#39;s voting system is too susceptible to manipulation. The truth of the entire universe could be buried under artificial downvotes and nobody would take it seriously. The vast majority of Redditors have a somewhat neutral perspective on a given topic until they see what the hivemind has upvoted/downvoted. It is the perfect propoganda machine, just look at r/politics and the mindless drones that inhabit it.</p>

<p>Trying to turn r/Conspiracy into the vessel you&#39;ve proposed is folly and will be flipped upside-down with artificial voting and algorithims designed to derail open discussions. I&#39;ve come to believe that sites like 4Chan, anonymous message boards in which EVERYONE has an opportunity to be seen free of a &quot;hivemind&quot; influence, is the best way to reach the truth coupled with an archive of important information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last year (now I have a new user id) I already wrote a comment on a similar subject. I am not sure if I see it the right way but, in my opinion the very terms &quot;conspiracy&quot;/&quot;consiracy theory&quot; are continuously being misinterpreted and used in wrong or distorted contexts and due to being overloaded with spooky tin foil stuff they tend to attract people who are not necessarily interested in real discussions and investigative work, in sensible conclusions and directives. Maybe I am completely wrong - but I wonder if it might be useful to find a new term for this work and open up a new subreddit with strict rules and high demands on quality and depth of the stuff people post. I am a Reddit and also an investigative newbie, and furthermore I am not a native english speaker and therefore sometimes miss the details. But from the first day I joined Reddit <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seemed to me as the place where the tin foil hats meet. When I tell people in my environment something like &quot;you know.. I don&#39;t necessarily believe in all that stuff they tell us on TV&quot; they often respond &quot;oh, you believe in those conspiracies!?&quot; The people mix up terms and concepts. It may be time to introduce some basic concepts into &quot;our&quot; work. Just like OP did. When I started digging into this stuff 18 months ago I soon realized that the most important thing is to understand some basic psychology (of masses) and learn the grammar and vocabulary of deception and.. maybe most important: the reason why we (yes, all of us, sometimes) deceive. Furthermore I am pretty sure that enslavement, deception, fraud, manipulation and abuse must have a counterpart or counterweight. This must be the reluctance of people to, think for themselves, to evolve, to take responsibility, to communicate, to act decisively when things go wrong and to just say &quot;no&quot; when they don&#39;t agree. 
I think we should not focus on &quot;conspiracy&quot; but on investigation of things that just don&#39;t make sense or that are harmful. This work should have a scientific foundation and it should have a focus on understanding and solving problems. </p>

<p>I get it, language makes a difference, but surely we can avoid resorting to such fake sounding words??</p>

<p>Normally I would recommend <em>comprehend</em> to replace understand, but seeing as it’s being used in a format of ‘we understand that x’, I instead propose the word <em>commitment</em>, as in ‘we are committed to each other, we are committed to fighting and exposing corruption, and we are committed to our role [as truth seekers]</p>

<p>Language is important, but humans exist above language. Refusing to use words like understand and replacing them with nonsense words like overstand, in my opinion and view, is essentially putting humans below language, which is not where we belong. </p>

<p>We overstand that they are all corrupt, and we are not interested in your petty professional wrestling. We are interested in shining our light on those behind the curtains, pulling the strings. Partisan political posts will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>I believe that for every corrupt figure of no integrity, there is a true patriot of high integrity. I have confidence in this because I believe I am one, and for most people reading this, you will also know that you are one. It is okay to question others, but it is not okay to ignore the evidence and create our own narrative.</p>

<p>As an extension of this, I strongly believe that right now in the US we are seeing a significant imbalance of corruption, dishonesty and danger in the US political system and it is <strong>okay</strong> and even encouraged to acknowledge this.</p>

<p>It shows me I&#39;m not the only person here that has an appropriate &#39;critical thinking&#39; world view, who would prefer to talk about genuine definitions instead of paradigms, who would prefer discussion of ideas over statement of opinions.</p>

<p>I make a lot of effort to talk to people. To cut passed the arrogant, ego-driven BS that developed in this internet age and attack at the core of the problem - how people think.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good start, all this, the problem is, how many people actually read this whole post? One of the problems anyway...</p>

<p>taking back <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taking back from who? The people who you can no longer mention (rule 10) are implementing censorship in a effort to control the subs narrative..</p>

<p>Hence the rule 10 and massive rule 10 shift these past few months. Not to mention long time contributors getting site wide bands. The Rule 10s are complacent with Reddits leftist agenda.</p>

<p>Any censorship. Any walls. Anything that hinders free discussion is terrible. Even in the name of <em>gasp</em> spam.</p>

<p>How many post have been removed due to the new rules.. A lot.</p>

<p>Any comment that doesnt suit their narrative is an attack now and insta removal. Per rule 10.</p>

<p>Same for the thread wall submission. Pre screenimg thread submissions LMFAO.</p>

<p>Wait until midterms. This sub is going to flip like politics did in 2016 after the Brock boys got their funding..</p>
