    <div class="md"><p>the first thing ANY gov has to do is implement a system by which its rules can mutate, and roll back.  that system HAS TO be a narrative structure.  the modes of mutation HAVE TO be limited and clearly defined.  it&#39;s appending single responsibility rules.  and you need this in a language everyone can speak so that everyone can both understand the rules and they can contribute suggestions on rule improvements.  the complexity of gov is a monster that needs to be tamed.</p>

<p>hmmm.  we don&#39;t have anything yet that&#39;s human and machine readable, or written in a globally understood language.  we don&#39;t have it so that it can be modelled easily such that it&#39;s testable and predictable.  we don&#39;t have any of that shit.  really at a fundamental level our designs suck.  the single best social design we currently use (and btw it&#39;s still broken) is the legal system - which understands at a basic level the need for narrative.  but it&#39;s still written in its own domain specific language and it&#39;s not available to the average citizen, and as a result it&#39;s been corrupted (because the cohort is one of our checks and balances).  so that&#39;s a problem.  we have the means and the nerds to rewrite all that shit and we should.</p>

<p>you&#39;re throwing slogans around.  tell me how you can have accurate communication <em>without</em> agreement on terms.  you simply cannot.  </p>

<p>so that removes your language critique.</p>

<p>on the others, i haven&#39;t said anything.  so you&#39;re pigeonholing my statements into a model that you have no idea based on what i wrote if that&#39;s what i&#39;m saying.  you&#39;re just pushing that model, which btw is not representative of what i wrote or even think, for what reason?  if the only way you can conceive of things is thru pre-packaged models that have been provided to you, then you&#39;re probably gonna have a bad time.</p>

<p>what you want is a way in which you can have a spectrum of different ideas for how to live and have them not bang against each other, particularly when they are diametrically opposed and irreconcilable.  so you need to allow self-selection so that people can choose the rules they want.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s The $64,000 Question! Start by &quot;draining the swamp&quot; as much as you can to expose the horrible slimy things which lie just below the surface, they&#39;re ambush predators like alligators!</p>

<p>And so far DT&#39;s making some heavy weight moves <em>which are not being reported in Any way by the MSM</em> but that doesn&#39;t really matter as DT doesn&#39;t <em>rely upon</em> the MSM like the Cabal have for the past century so he DGAF and communicates directly to the people with his tweets ... and Q. Who imo is someone <em>very close</em> to him. The guy&#39;s a fucking enigma and few people have a solid &#39;handle&#39; on him and what <em>really is motivating him</em> to do this. IMO he&#39;s a rich Patriot who wants to leave both a historical legacy for not just his kids and fam in general, he <em>really wants to</em> STOP all these fucking pizza and pasta enterprises from continuing, and he&#39;s not alone, <em>far from it</em> in fact ... there are many world leaders completely UNconnected to the Luciferian Illuminati Cabal and who would like nothing better than to see it eliminated</p>

<p>How else do you explain the incredible displays of foreign leaders to him when he visits them? They <em>know</em> the backstory and are <em>happy</em> to help, as for most of them, they aren&#39;t in the position of power to deal with such high profile people, BUT the Don sure is!</p>

<p>He&#39;s been dealing with the mafia trying to shake him down <em>forever</em> and to survive that takes some quality street smarts</p>

<p>and never forget he has a few dozen <em>extremely competent</em> advisors (in their own fields) including the top NSA and the military people, including Supreme Court judges, of which he&#39;s appointed ~20 since he became POTUS</p>

<p>and last but not least, he thinks Assange should be pardoned! What does that suggest to you about him? It&#39;s the opposite of what the DNC <em>tried very hard</em> to achieve, extradite him and lock him up</p>

<p>What any dictator  does with &#39;dissidents&#39; no?</p>

<p>And the D&#39;s no dictator, narcissisistic sure but evil? No.. He&#39;s a fucking Boy Scout compared to the likes of the Bush&#39;s, the  Clintons et al!</p>

<p>I&#39;d seriously doubt that your &quot;TPTB&quot; love me, again you have no understanding of ?balance? and ?truth?, which is fine because it shows that you can at least learn much more from your own willful ignorance.</p>

<p>And that too is the way of ?truth?. It takes a while to learn that because learning the way of truth, studying it is a very intense process. You&#39;ve got to have a love for it or you won&#39;t last a day.</p>

<p>Your above comment has all the symptoms of a person that is limited in his will to fully want to understand the world and way of truth.</p>

<p>I have this feeling that  you might be one of those who believe that Trump is a guy that is taking on the &quot;NWO&quot; and stuff, right?</p>

<p>Allow me to quote you, in reference to Trump:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7nu0va/a_quick_reminder_what_the_real_conspiracy_is/ds6sol7/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7nu0va/a_quick_reminder_what_the_real_conspiracy_is/ds6sol7/</a></p>

<p><em>IMO what&#39;s he&#39;s trying to do is a very difficult thing, he&#39;s taken on TPTB except I think he was asked to run by a group of Patriots</em></p>

<p>The fact that you talk in this fashion about a known corrupt person shows that you haven&#39;t found the way of truth yet.</p>

<p>Or what about this one, also from your mouth (or fingertips):</p>

<p><em>Becaoz the Truth hurts when you acknowledge you&#39;ve been believing LIES for so long ... when they could just eat some humble pie and move on But most people a stubborn dumb cunts</em></p>

<p>When you feel you&#39;re ready to come to terms with ?my opinions?, just let me know. I&#39;m right here building something really ?amazing?.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have always been authoritarian rulers throughout history. Because some people feel the drive to dominate and control others. That&#39;s a part of human nature, it&#39;s baked in to society. There will always be some who seek to dominate their peers. The struggle to free the individual&#39;s will from the collectivist authoritarian society will never end so long as you want to keep living in a society with made up of human beings.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean we should abide those who seek to control. We&#39;ll never &quot;exterminate all evil&quot;, but we should still fight it when we see it. You make it sound like we should just accept that authoritarian pressure. Just because we&#39;ll never defeat it completely doesn&#39;t mean we should submit to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You make it sound like we should just accept that authoritarian pressure. Just because we&#39;ll never defeat it completely doesn&#39;t mean we should submit to it. &quot;</p>

<p>I never said that people should submit to oppression and authoritarian regimes. I point out that there is a natural balance between good and evil that will never go away. It can&#39;t because it is part of the natural system. Light and darkness, good and evil, male and female, up and down etc</p>

<p>That is where it starts when we want to solve this dystopian problem, by first acknowledging that this balance exercise is real and will always be with us.</p>

<p>Then we have to move on to containing the evil, the oppression and darkness so that we can harness it to stay fit, alert and sharp.</p>

<p>As much as I too would like to have no evil and no oppressive regimes it simply is not realistic. We can want it but that doesn&#39;t mean we can ever get that.</p>

<p>There is a difference between accepting that evil will always be there and trying to contain it and submitting to the rule of a tyrannical World Regime.</p>

<p>That is also what I mean with the way of truth. If we can&#39;t be honest about the fact that we need to balance out good vs evil then we are not being honest with ourselves, and then we will never get to the actual balancing out of the forces that fuel us.</p>

<p>If that is supposed to make me feel bad, hurt me or frustrate me... it doesn&#39;t. Sorry, your efforts are in vain.</p>

<p>The more you respond like this, by insinuating things that are not even part of the reality - not the truth by far, the more you make a fool out of yourself. I&#39;m not even going to refute any of your insinuations because it is more fun to let you live in your bubble. THAT is super entertaining, <em>sunshine</em>!</p>

<p>Just look at how you completely derail an honest thread, good people don&#39;t do that. Clearly you are not a good person and it is YOU who willingly rape the way of truth.</p>

<p>And whether I am a feminist bitch or a stunning hunk that you would envy is quite frankly none of your business after posting the way you did.</p>
