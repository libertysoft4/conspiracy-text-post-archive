        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s ironic how people will say of conspiracy theorists, &quot;You&#39;re gullible, easily manipulated...you believe everything you read.&quot;</p>

<p>They read the news without questioning or fact-checking the official narrative, believing the words of major outlets to be the voice of God, and they have the nerve to say I believe everything I read. </p>

<p>All because I do my own research and find the facts, search for truth. </p>

<p>Pizzagate is a hell of a phenomenon. The term &quot;fake news&quot; began with Pizzagate, when Brock&#39;s Media Matters decided to censor any mention of the conspiracy theory. When I bring it up, the most common response is, &quot;You&#39;re gullible, easily manipulated.&quot;</p>

<p>But Pizzagate didn&#39;t come from &quot;fake news&quot; sites. It came from people doing their own research, finding source information straight from the horse&#39;s mouth -- instagrams, emails, real-life court cases -- and yet it&#39;s always &quot;you believe in bullshit.&quot; </p>

<p>What baffles me about Pizzagate deniers is their complete lack of knowledge on the subject. They will say, &quot;It&#39;s not real, it&#39;s debunked,&quot; but if you bring up names like James Alefantis, Jeffery Epstein, or quote any of the Podesta emails, they will say, &quot;Who&#39;s that? What&#39;s that?&quot;</p>

<p>It would be like if I said, &quot;The Big Mac does not exist.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, have you ever been to McDonald&#39;s? &quot;Nope, never heard of McDonald&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p>I believe everything I read. I&#39;m gullible and believe in bullshit. But if CNN says something is debunked, there&#39;s no need for you to do the research or find out WHAT is being discussed. </p>

<p>How the fuck can you say something is false if you have no fucking clue what it is?</p>

<p>We have to be silent as conspiracy theorists. Any time we bring up the truth we are shut down and called crazy, or gullible, easily manipulated etc. There&#39;s no point in even bringing things up, or even trying to troll a brainwashed discussion. We just have to hang out in our little cliques so when the truth eventually comes out, we just sit in the back row and nod at eachother. But we never get to say, &quot;I told you so&quot; to the people who called us crazy.</p>

<p>I just wanted to rant. I know you guys understand exactly what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will never not be called crazy, even when you&#39;re right.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the perception of being a conspiracy theorist, you&#39;re locked to the fringe talking about issues that most people would rather let slip into Oblivion because it makes them think uncomfortable thoughts.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t want their problems solved, people don&#39;t want their messes cleaned, because then they&#39;ll have nothing left but the big ole abyss to stare at.</p>

<p>The sooner you get used to being perceived as lesser than most, the sooner you&#39;re able to realize how this sick game is really being run.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just our curse, which often just ends in depression, anger, and suicidal thoughts. We aren&#39;t going to be hailed for anything, just look at Bill Cooper. Only people talking his name used to be here, but that&#39;s even fading for this vapid ideological battlefield that is post election America where we decided to take up keyboards instead of a guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there certainly is a point to bringing these points up! people need to have their eyes opened to what has been going on around us our entire lives. we have been conditioned for so long to think anyone who comes forth with the truth is crazy...
those of us who know the truth are not bothered by anyone thinking we are insane lol.
pizza-pedo gate is a place to start digging...it goes much deeper and comes from a place of pure evil.
when people finally connect the dots... from the gov. to pharma, Hwood, tech, food industry, military, MSM, etc their minds will be blown and life will be forever changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. None of us here started out as &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;. We all used to believe exactly the same bullshit as everyone else, trusted the mainstream media etc etc. At that point, we did &quot;believe everything&quot; we read, without questioning.</p>

<p>The fact that we have changed our minds is because we looked beyond (through) the official narrative and saw that there is so much information deliberately hidden. We have seen both sides, whereas others have only seen one.</p>

<p>Accusing conspiracy theorists of &quot;believing everything they read&quot; is ignorant and hypocritical in equal measure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand where you&#39;re coming from. It&#39;s a thankless task doing your own research.</p>

<p>I followed pizzagate as it was initially breaking.  The bizarre comments on Comet Ping Pong&#39;s instagram by a DC human trafficking prosecutor among others.  The distasteful artwork collection of Tony Podesta.  John Podesta and spirit cooking.  The Fatherhood video feat. Skippy.  Initially there was enough smoke there to keep digging.</p>

<p>However, I was never convinced that any of the frequently referenced Podesta emails were related to cp or trafficking.  Also, while the CPP instagram was inappropriate for a family-friendly pizza shop, apart from the #caris posts, it seemed pretty standard for an afterhours indie band venue/gay culture hotspot.  It reflected degeneracy plus a sense of humor that crossed multiple lines, but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve stopped following pizzagate because wherever people ask for specifics they&#39;re presented with the pieces of the conspiracy I didn&#39;t find convincing.</p>

<p>My advice, drop the pizzagate label.  Focus on each part instead of trying to piece it all together.  Show how fucked up spirit cooking is and the connections Podesta and other big names have to it.  Talk about the pedophile rings that have documented mainstream evidence to convince people it happens much more frequently than they think.  Bring up the Clinton Foundation and Haiti, pay-to-play, etc.  I could be mistaken but, in my opinion, pizzagate itself is a poisoned well without enough tangible evidence to gain much traction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree while Pizzagate isn&#39;t debunked, but many people think it is. It&#39;s also political linked which is messy.</p>

<p>But there is enough evidence if we look at global elites, that they are involved in crimes of trafficking. That&#39;s an easier focus for most individuals. Any powerful establishment has been corrupted by this sickness.... Religion, Sports and Hollywood, why would politics be any different?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that questioning some ones mental fitness should be a bannable offense. I doubt any other sub will allow you to mock cancer patients or people with other health problems why do shills get a pass when the poke fun at crazy people. Not that they are crazy, this is just a complete moron&#39;s way of feeling superior over people.Eg. The Dunning Kruger effect. If you have never heard of it look it up immediately. This literally describes every person that is in Top minds, well all the ones in there that arent getting paid to be there. The people there under their own volition have a false perception that they are far superior in mental capacity, their cognitive bias is veiled to them because of illusory superiority. So anybody that isn&#39;t completely trusting of known liars is crazy, and because they can point out critical thinkers by calling them crazy, somehow that makes them the smart ones. Good luck getting these window lickers to understand any of this. They are either bots ran on a commador 64, or someone who barely made it through the most basic of learning disability classes in the public school system which happens to be spinning the educational drain and ranked near and below third world countries. Mental giants I tell you.</p>

<p>Its way worse then you got drowned in bad science from the some jet fuel kooks. I mean you are still pointing to the word Hotdog being a code for boy prostitute.

If Satan truly run this place what makes you think he isn&#39;t fully in charge of the government???  Not a single person in the government has a reason to come out and say well shit you guys were right about 9/11 (You pick your conspiracy) Can you imagine even Trump saying that?? I can&#39;t.  Governments don&#39;t petal in Truth it&#39;s there job is to give you a narrative and anything that doesn&#39;t go with that narrative will be denied.  I delved into flat earth at first I thought it was a joke and I made fun of it....a lot.  Then I actually did some research on it and I stopped laughing and started freaking out.  See I love SCI-FI 90% of my book library is Space related. Loved Firefly Babylon 5 Star Trek, Star Wars freaking star anything.  To say the least becoming a flat earther was the second most painful ordeal that I&#39;ve personally gone through.  Then to have other christians say well you just want to be special....FUCK special fucking hate being special, like flat earth for most people is equal to special ED.  I don&#39;t believe in it because I want to look like a retard, I feel strongly that it&#39;s the truth and not a happy got ya truth either.  I had to give up loving space because the 2 don&#39;t really mix now do they. Well that&#39;s my rant and I totally know I&#39;m going to get shitted on for it.

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me that pizzagate was a lot of sound and fury ultimately signifying nothing. When it became clear that there was no substance to it, pizzagaters tried to justify its existence by talking about it in the same breaths as actual elite pedophile cases, like Epstein. </p>

<p>Does Epstein have any connection to Comet Ping Pong? </p>

<p>Demand answers about cult members caught red-handed trafficking children (who knew food only as a reward, didn&#39;t know what toilets were, and had been sexually abused. They also lived in a cult compound where a studio was found for making child sex videos, documents were found of them being involved in ceremonies of live goat sacrifices, documents were found detailing how to avoid the authorities when moving children internationally, documents were found concerning buying and selling children internationally), </p>

<p>The MSM reported all this and it was dismissed from up on high as a &quot;CIA internal matter.&quot; The Finders Cult. The MSM links are on my website: <a href="http://www.unitedagainstmindcontrol.wordpress.com">www.unitedagainstmindcontrol.wordpress.com</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s so many verifiablle nefarious things that demand answers. The Finders have nothing to do with pizza, but spooks sexually abusing and trafficking kids? Absolutely. </p>

<p>If one tenth of the energy was put into legit conspiracies that is put into 4chan spawned &quot;Pizzagate&quot; we might actually get some things done. </p>

<p>Epstein, Aquino, The Finders, Franklin Cover-up, The Presidio child sex abuse scandal- these are all real and all go unanswered for while more (and it doesn&#39;t even deserve this phrase) &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot; is churned out about a pizza parlor. </p>

<p>Get it together, people,</p>
