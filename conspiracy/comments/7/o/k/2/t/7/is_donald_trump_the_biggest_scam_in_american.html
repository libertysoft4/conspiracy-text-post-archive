<p>He didn&#39;t keep away illegal Immigrant invaders.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t prosecute Hillary which was literally making herself unelectable via a series of fiascos, including pizzagate.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t purge the controlling forces of Obama and Soros from his office and employs Goldman Sachs employees onto his office.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t expose the 911 false flag and deep state secrets and instead acts obediently to Deep state plans.</p>

<p>He was waging war against North Korea, Syria and Iran in an accelerated pace similar to Obama who destroyed Egypt, Libya, Syria, Ukraine and crippled Hong Kong in just 4 years.</p>

<p>After his election he follows and bleches out the same lies that Obama said during the United Nations annual conference.</p>

<p>And at last, his voice became completely different from before he was elected, dull and boring, mind controlled maybe?</p>

<p>This is defintely a scam where you were choosing between a quick death (Hillary) and the slow death (Trump) which the slow death always wins as intended.</p>

<p>Another proof that president elections are scams that tried to keep the peasants obedient to their masters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do your own research and then trust your gut. That&#39;s all you can do. </p>

<p>And listen, if you choose- there is <em>nobody</em> at that level you can trust. <em>Nobody</em> gets there without either some blind luck (not Trump&#39;s case) or without compromising their morals to some extent. Trump has always had an angle beyond making America great again. The moment you stop believing he simply loves America and start considering his real goals, they become fairly obvious. He&#39;s a shallow, self-serving guy who skates through life by not caring about any wreckage he leaves behind him. It&#39;s not hard to be successful with an inheritance and those particular traits.</p>

<p>But I could easily be wrong. Like I said, trust your gut and always examine the motives of the people you&#39;re measuring. Nobody in power is a saint, and all of them have branding consultants. </p>

<p>It’s also true that the number of deportations had been on the rise throughout Bush’s presidency. I believe they peaked in 2016.</p>

<p>I don’t know if the lower number of deportations from 2017 has anything to do with Trump, but the number was lower. It was.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>The Clinton Foundation</em>*<br/></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>The Hill reported on Thursday that the FBI has launched a new investigation into the Clinton Foundation which focuses on whether the Clinton’s engaged in any pay-to-play politics or other illegal activities during Clinton’s time as Secretary of State in the Obama administration.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><strong>Clinton’s Use Of A Private Email Server</strong><br/></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>On Thursday, The Hill published a report from John Solomon which featured former FBI director James Comey’s original draft on the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. The draft showed that the term “gross negligence” was used multiple times and specifically said that there was evidence to conclude that Clinton committed a felony. Anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok, who texted about having an “insurance policy” against Trump’s election, softened the language in Comey’s draft so Clinton could avoid possible criminal charges.  </p>

<p>A senior law enforcement official told Solomon that the DOJ “was exploring whether any issues from that probe should be re-opened but cautioned the effort was not at the stage of a full investigation.”  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>3  <strong>Uranium One</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered federal prosecutors at the DOJ in December to begin interviewing FBI agents about the evidence they collected during a criminal investigation into the controversial Uranium One deal, which directly involved the Clintons.  </p>

<p>There are multiple aspects at play in this investigation, from the Obama administration threatening a witness to stay quiet because they did not want him testifying to Congress because it would impact the 2016 presidential election, to the Russian officials who were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering directly connected to the Uranium One deal.   </p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><strong>The Obama Administration Ending Investigations Into Hezbollah</strong><br/></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>In December, Politico published a bombshell report about how the Obama administration ended a massive federal investigation, dubbed “Project Cassandra,” into the Iranian-backed terrorist organization Hezbollah. The Obama administration’s decision to sabotage the investigation so it could secure the Iran nuclear deal allowed Hezbollah to traffic hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cocaine into the United States and allowed them to operate “the largest material support scheme for terrorism operations the world had ever seen.”    </p>

<p>A little over a week after the report came out, congressional leaders announced that they were launching an investigation into the Obama administration’s efforts to end the Hezbollah investigation. This could include investigating Clinton because she was Obama’s Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013 and the State Department was involved in the Obama administration’s efforts to end the investigation, according to the report. Politico reported, “Further complicating the picture was the role of the State Department, which often wanted to quash both law-enforcement actions and covert operations due to the political backlash they created.”    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what you consider a scam.  Obama is a muslim and non-American puppet installed by cia would have to be the biggest fraud perpetrated on the US people.  Trump being a nationalist/populist is going to be up there though.  He&#39;s a Zionist and likely wasn&#39;t supposed to win, but was controlled opposition from the start.  His family is Jewish, his partners are Jewish and <a href="https://imgur.com/gDdV9U3">everyone in his cabinet and appointed positions are jewish</a>.  Everything he does benefits Israel and Israel first.  His position on Syria and the fake gas attack benefitted Israel.  They are literally naming streets and buildings after him and its only been a year.  Acknowledging Jerusalem as the capital and pushing for it hard has no benefit for America and makes no sense as the supposed mediator between the two states and with everyone else staying neutral and ignoring how Israel has made all these land grabs in their apartheid state.   But they still did it.   </p>

<p>So, no, its not the biggest scam, but he isn&#39;t the man portrayed by media or his campaign either.   </p>
