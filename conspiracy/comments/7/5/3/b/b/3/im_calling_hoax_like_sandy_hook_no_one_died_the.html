Machine guns at that rate would have left a trail of smoke, blood, bodies and guts that would still be smoldering. The blood and guts would have caused a stampede unlike anything close to what we saw. People standing around in a war zone? Give me a break.</p></li>
<li><p>The brother, Eric Paddock. Clearly acting. No question. So if he is an actor, then the idea of his brother being involved is simply part of the play. The idea of being set up as a patsy is a false narrative. It was a hoax.  </p></li>

<p>I dont know a whole lot about guns. Ive shot hunting rifles but nothing else. </p>

<p>But my common sense tells me that with the fire rate that a bumpstock adds to a rifle, we literally should have seen people shredded.  </p>

<p>If you take one in the stomach, at the kind of fire rate you&#39;re going to take a few more with it surely?</p>

<p>Another guy who is supposed to be the usual &quot;Iraq vet hero&quot; of the event says he knew that the trucks used by concert officials should have the keys still in them, so the <em>first one</em> he tried just happened to have the keys in the ignition and he was able to drive 30 people to the hospital by stealing a truck. </p>

<p>People are getting carried away with multiple shooters and all that when it&#39;s being promoted by the very crisis actors who are being broadcast on MSM networks:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anXdfUUDfzI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anXdfUUDfzI</a></p>

<p>They are frantic to make people believe at the very least that people were shot when there&#39;s no reason to even think that anything was shot. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had what must have been 10 people tell me they know someone who died, yet no one can even show me a picture of bullet damage.</p>

<p>One commenter even told me he had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74w7fk/multiple_people_in_the_crowd_saying_the_gunshots/do1o63a/?context=3">5 friends</a> who died.</p>

<p>No one died; this is staged hoax bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok let me put it this way, it wasn&#39;t a hoax. There are lots of videos of it, lots of witnesses of it, police responded to it, the f.b.i. responded to it.

    <div class="md"><p>I didnt see any drum magazines in the pics.  Regular 30 round mags.   </p>

<p>If this guy shot for 10 min as reported.   And shot 6k rounds as reported , tgat means he would have had to reload 200 times.  In 10 minutes.  Plus squeeze off 6k rounds.   My finger gets tired after 60 rounds with a stock .40s&amp;w handgun.</p>

<p>Even with 100 round drum mags, which i do not believe are a thing, but hypothetically, he would still need to reload 60 times to shoot 6k rounds</p>

<p>Numbers just dont seem to add uo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you have them post pictures of the entry and if there was an exit wound. also if it was still in them, did the doctors collect the bullet? Bullets sound like evidence to me. If the round matches a AR15 round i&#39;ll buy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing you wrote touches on a topic that interests me. </p>

<p>Are you an actor? Are you a director? What is your experience with acting? I mean, are you experienced in the theatrical arts?</p>

<p>Due to the popularity of movies and TV, many Americans watch a lot of acting. But acting is very different than real life. </p>

<p>What we think is real is often what we think best emulates what we see on the screen. But the truth is that what we see on the screen is &quot;acting,&quot; and in real life people&#39;s raw emotions and reactions come off as &quot;bad acting.&quot;</p>

<p>So I am very skeptical of the entire &quot;crisis actor&quot; rhetoric. It&#39;s interesting when one crisis has a witness that looks close, maybe even identical to another witness, named differently, of another crisis. That to me could indicate that there are &quot;crisis actors.&quot; But then you have a couple of problems. First, there are people that look very similar to each other. Second, wouldn&#39;t these low-paid &quot;crisis actors&quot; have an incentive to do AMAs on Reddit and otherwise let the cat out of the bag. </p>

<p>How about someone doing a request for an AMA on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> -- crisis actor, with verification (pic from an actual crisis). Open it up to actual witnesses from a crisis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, sloppy sniper. I looked a bit at your comment history. I think we have a lot in common. I was not woken up by Sandy Hook, as you were, but it was early on in my journey and was the point where I discovered that hoaxed events were a thing. Like you, it shook me up. But it turns out it&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. And no I&#39;m not just talking about Boston and Paris and London and Brussels and San Bernardino etc etc. There is so much about the world around us that is hoaxed and managed and has been for centuries. If you&#39;re interested to learn more, first [read this paper.] </p>

<p>Then go here:</p>

<p>Scroll down to the paper from 10/18/13 called &quot;Theosophy and the Beat Generation,&quot; and then read the subsequent papers in chronological order (well you can skip is art reviews and poetry if you want). It&#39;s important to read them in order, because he makes discoveries along the way and later papers build on earlier ones. </p>

<p>What makes you say hospital staff saw injured people after the &quot;Vegas shooting&quot;? </p>

<p>The fact that the <em>media</em> <em>claimed</em> it? You&#39;re relying on accounts from the <em>media</em>? </p>
