    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s assume the bullets were real and many people died. They have to use crisis actors anyway to control &quot;the narrative,&quot; e.g., the story is that Paddock acted alone, so we can&#39;t have real witness saying that there were shooters in the crowd or perched elsewhere. We can&#39;t have them giving descriptions of other people and events within the event that don&#39;t match what they&#39;re trying to sell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a firm believer in government bullshit and I suspect conspiracies exist all around us, but I have never been able to get on-board with the notion of crisis actors. Honestly, can somebody explain when this idea originated? It seems to me to be too far fetched to believe. I tend to think that conspiracies are not possible when too many are involved...it becomes to complicated to control. In all instances where I have heard this theory, I have thought the people spreading it where nuts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree he acts a little strange considering the circumstances but I attribute that more to gender and perhaps personality than acting. I think he seems to be trying to maintain composure and he may be the type that doesn&#39;t show emotions. Maybe he has a military background? I have a difficult time showing emotions in front of strangers so I might come off as weird too. I&#39;ve seen some videos before and I&#39;ve entertained the idea but it just does not ring true to me. However, I would not doubt that the entire event could have been manufactured on a government level and victims considered simple casualities in the war against citizens. </p>

<p>No offense, but you seen to think you are special, and above others. Have a bit of compassion.</p>

<p>I disagree. In my opinion, people with resources have wealthy families to protect, and the punishment is more than just defying an agreement. </p>

<p>The only reason I notice this, is because a homeless, teen political shill yelled about her experiences on a local street corner. The poor gal didn&#39;t even have enough bus money to get back to her home state.</p>

Why would a wealthy sibling protect any more vehemently than a poor person? You see, you have revealed your elitist tendencies. Most of the conscripted Soros robots I&#39;ve met were incongruently faithful to the operators who turned and employed them, almost imprinted like baby geese. What technologies can do that?
