    <div class="md"><p>I agree, I dont watch him. I watch some of the people on infowars, but not AJ. </p>

<p>The courtcase tho, that was the mother of his child trying to take her away(i think, something similar atleast) so in court Alex said he just acted as crazy as he does for the show. That is legit, because he do get cray there sometime, and if youve seen clips of him when his not on the show he is a different person. I would not hold that case against him</p>
