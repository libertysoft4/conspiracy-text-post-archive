        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is a great article concerning the deception that Jesus was a Jew. <a href="https://biblicisminstitute.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/jesus-was-not-a-jew/">https://biblicisminstitute.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/jesus-was-not-a-jew/</a></p>

<p>This would be most interesting for those of you with a Christian upbringing, or those of you just interested in the relationship between Judaism &amp; Christianity.</p>

<p>After reading the article, notice the few &quot;Jews&quot; in the comments twisting the authors words, classic...</p>

<p>Ultimately I think the article is a gentle warning of the unhealthy fetish Christians in the west have for &quot;Jews&quot; and Zionism, which was brought on by deception.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: please read the article, that&#39;s the point of my post. The title &amp; the background I provided will not make sense otherwise</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What do you mean by Jewish? Seriously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What he means is that Jesus was Jewish, you dense fuck.</p>

<p>What you article argues (very poorly) is an etymology of the term &quot;Jew&quot; (in English mind you as it doesn&#39;t touch other languages to support his  &quot;theory&quot;)  , which does&#39;t make any sense anyway. As he is discussing the term we use today. It&#39;s like discussing how early Christians were  called  by some &quot;The Nazarenes&quot; and hence that makes John, Matthew, Peter..etc and other disciples not Christians.</p>

<p>If we called Jews today  &quot;Judahite&quot;, &quot;Judeans&quot; or wahataver.... as article argues, Jesus in that respect would be a &quot;Judahite&quot;, &quot;Judean&quot; or whatever society subscribed to call the people who follow Abraham.</p>

<p>Do you fucking understand that core tenant of Christian faith is that Jesus was the last messiah of Abraham people a.k.a Jews. It is literally inscribed in scripts (old Testament)  that last  Messiah of Jews  - have to be Jew. That makes Jesus , the  Jesus. That&#39;s how he got chance to preach and gather people. He was literally sent by god to Jews, for Jews, to  fulfil Jewish prophecy. Only after he was rejected by Jews for not  being a Messiah (as they believed that last Messiah can&#39;t be born of the deity) ..... early Christians decided to spread Jesus words to non Jewish people (hence replacing the circumcision  for example, with baptism)  . How people called Jews at that time is irrelevant. He is a Jew.</p>

<p>What author of article is actually insinuating is a slight anti-semitism(dare I say??) as he  obviously has a problem with the term &quot;Jew&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, we Christians must do our part and remove the word “Jew” from the translated bible and replace it with Judahite. That way all of us may know that Jesus was NOT a Jew.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words: We Christians should stop associate Jesus with (((Jews)) .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re splitting hairs pretty fucking hard trying to make it what you want it to be. Like the guy above me, I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re having to keep from typing (((Jews))). Jesus absolutely has to be a Jew. It&#39;s the entire point of his story and character arc.</p>

<p>You cannot take him being the Jewish Messiah out of his story and still have a story. You - and the author of the article - want him to not be a zionist, which he absolutely isn&#39;t, I&#39;ll agree with that. But if he&#39;s not a Jew, he&#39;s not important and he&#39;s certainly not anyone that has any authority for a major religion to be built on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did read the article and if you read my post you ll see I addressed issues in the article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WHO IS A JEW?</p>

<p>The word “Jew” did not come into existence until the year 1775. Its modern connotation points to someone who follows and adheres to a faith similar to that of the Pharisees of Judah, but is not of the tribe and stock of Judah. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the get go author tries to define an etno-religious group (Jews)  through its etymology (&quot;The word “Jew” did not come into existence...&quot;) </p>

<p>Furthermore</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The King James Authorized translation of the New Testament into English was begun in 1604 and first published in 1611. The word ‘Jew’ did not appear in it either. The word ‘Jew’ appeared in both these well known editions in their 18th century revised versions for the first times.</p>

<p>“When the word ‘Jew’ was first introduced into the English language in the 18th century its one and only implication, inference and innuendo was ‘Judean’. <strong>However, during the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries a well-organized and well-financed international ‘pressure group’ created a so-called ‘secondary meaning’ for the word ‘Jew’ among the English-speaking peoples of the world</strong>. This so-called ‘secondary meaning’ for the word ‘Jew’ bears no relation whatsoever to the 18th century original connotation of the word ‘Jew’. It is a misrepresentation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So according to author there is world wide conspiracy to redefine what original Jew was in a Bible. Author admits it something it only exist in English speaking countries,  but ti doesn&#39;t explain why then  &quot;Jew&quot; in other languages (specifically German and Slavic for example, as well as Greek)   ...is not refined and it is  old as..well a Bible (before King James translated version?)  </p>

<p>In other words, how do you explain the term &quot;Jew&quot; in other languages which didn&#39;t change at all and it preserved original meaning and term which is also used today. (eg. term &quot;Jew&quot; used in Bible  is the same term used for Jews today)  The only stupidity that might exist is that English speaking people (mostly Americans) think that Christianity started with King James Bible.</p>

<p>But lets dig further</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, the religion that is known as Judaism is actually Pharisaism. Judaism – as it pertains to Pharisaism – is a misnomer since it is neither the doctrine of Judah nor the doctrine that Christ practiced.</p>

<p>It is the doctrine of the Pharisees of old, <strong>an evil doctrine</strong> they brought back from their Babylonian captivity. It does not follow the truth of the Bible, neither of the Old Testament nor of the New. Its central tenets are found in a book called the Talmud (the real Satanic Verses), **a book full of worldly traditions, lies, and superstitions.</p>

<p>Today, those who are known as Jews are in fact the non-Semitic and non-Israelite Ashkenazim, Sephardim, and Samaritans, who in later times joined small numbers of other races that converted to Judaism/Pharisaism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear that author tries to link Jews of today to, and I quote, &quot;an evil doctrine&quot; . However, author being clearly an English speaking  Christian can&#39;t bare the fact that actual Jesus and ideology he believes in derives from &quot;an evil doctrine&quot;.... so he decided to perform mental gymnastic in order to separate Jesus  from &quot;the Jew&quot; because it clearly fits his narrative. </p>

<p>Therefore Jesus is NOT a Jew but a Judahite. While Jews of today are, and I quote again, followers of &quot; <strong>an evil doctrine</strong> they brought back from their Babylonian captivity&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You also sound extremely emotional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As paid  shill who  gets  $2 per post  I really feel I am not paid enough to deal with stupidity on this level</p>

<p>I literally bold out citations from your article that clearly state how Jews of today practice, and I quote again:</p>

<p>&quot;an evil doctrine they brought back from their Babylonian captivity&quot;</p>

<p>Essentially labelling all Jews of today as evil. Not some Jews, not mentioning Zionist or something similar. No. Jews of today</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, those who are known as Jews are in fact the non-Semitic and non-Israelite Ashkenazim, Sephardim, and Samaritans, who in later times joined small numbers of other races that converted to Judaism/Pharisaism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Author clearly states that Jews of today are not the Biblical [Good] Jews that Jesus descended from, buy they are followers of an evil and corrupt doctrine..and if that was not enough....author argues that the reason we don&#39;t know about it  is because (((well paid organisations)))  in 18th century made sure to re-define  the term &quot;Jews&quot; in Bible. </p>

<p>If it is not antisemitism, what is it?</p>

<p>Its bloody textbook antisemitism mate.</p>

<p>and since you have no arguments to defend.... you engage into &quot;you are exposed&quot; and &quot;your reading skills are not up to task&quot; etc. Nope mate, it is not me who is exposed. </p>

<p>It is you.</p>
