        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As the shooting timeline and the supposed events surrounding JC (Jesus Campos), who totally exists, I felt compelled to do some digging on the Mandalay Bay. I find it especially interesting, that after Wynn makes a few curious statements rearding security practices in HIS (Wynn) Hotel, how the focus of the LEA/FBI shifted to all but outright saying that Mandelay&#39;s inadequate security is why the shooting was not stopped as quickly as it should&#39;ve been (or prevented alltogether).</p>

<p>Who better to tell the dirt on a business than it&#39;s customers (other than employees)? I have started searching through MB&#39;s reviews, dating 2016-now. This is a painstaking process, because it has thousands of visitors a day. A lot of the reviews are not anything that I found useful (although I hear ya, folks, some of you got shafed there!). So my criteria was to look for any reviewes that gave a glimpse of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hotel staff</li>
<li>Hotel security</li>
<li>Anything else that may indicate a pattern of problems</li>
<li>Anything that someone like SP (S PAddock/Shooter Patsy) would look at, when selecting a location.</li>
</ul>

<h2>To save some time, I won&#39;t post every link to every review, just some interesting details. Keep in mind, this is a SMALL percentage of reviews available across various sites (<a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com,Google,etc">www.tripadvisor.com,Google,etc</a>. Most of the travel sites use the Tripadviser main review database, however). I just chose these due to the specific content. Review dates should be considered from Oct 09, 2017.</h2>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Should MB/MGM be held responsible for not providing adequate measures to ensure the safety of their gueses? Don&#39;t have to be a genious to see how much ass-covering from all sides is going on. </p></li>
<li><p>A LOT of guests note that the voices/noise travels through walls. On one hand - that explains the need to book rooms around SP&#39;s suite. On the other - seems like a terrible place for any clandestine operation. Also, makes Campos story/200 shots even that harder to beleive. </p></li>
<li><p>Is the security footage from 2016 being reviewed at all? The Festival across the street was held same weekend, same location. If one was to plan this in advance - they would be seen staying in that area before.</p></li>
<li><p>Is there an entrance into the hotel/resort/parking area accessible via the tunnels? Sounds like a perfect way to anyone to slip out during the commotion. </p></li>
<li><p>Were guns brought in over  aperiod of several days/weeks, etc? Some guests mentioned that bellhops there sucked. It was an extremely busy weekend/week. Why chance bellhops talking about &quot;old dude who keeps bringing new suitcases in and makes them carry&quot;? One could simply bring 1-2 suitcases during busier hours, unnoticed by security.</p></li>
<li><p>If prostitutes are really abundant there, they probably know/seen who, when, and why. Of course, doubt they will talk.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>From Tripadvisor:</strong></p>

<p>Stayed: September 2017, traveled as a couple</p>

<p><em>Safety/Security: This is a problem for Mandalay Bay.</em>* On two separate occasions we witnessed people who were not supposed to be in the room area of the hotel. First, someone slid an advertisement for take out food under our door which was odd bc I was standing right on the inside of the door when they did it and could hear them fumbling around. *<em>Second and most alarming, when we were coming in on Saturday night around 2am we went to get on the elevator and there was an older gentleman already on-right before the elevator doors closed a young lady dressed provacatively jumped on and told the gentleman she was going wherever he was going. He said he was going to sleep and she proceeded to try and convince him to buy her (she was a prostitute). He got off on the same floor as us and she was left in the elevator alone so I can only imagine that she may have went from floor to floor looking for someone to take her up on her offer. *</em>My suggestion is that security booths are set up by the elevators allowing security to check people&#39;s room keys in order to allow entrance into the elevator area. I&#39;m really pretty shocked they don&#39;t already have this in place as it is standard protocol for most strip hotels to ensure guest safety. *<em>I&#39;m rating safety a 0...smh.</em></p>

&quot;*<em>During a 3 night stay, the hotel locked me out of my room 3 times - once each day. The only solution was to go down to the lobby and wait in the check-in line for service for them to fix my room lock. Wait-times were between 20 - 40 minutes each day. *</em>
So every day, I had to spend at least 30 minutes waiting, to simply access my room. The hotel promised they would &quot;send engineers&quot; to fix my room, but that obviously didn&#39;t work. 
Moreover, the TV did not work.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<h2>&quot;Dont stay on the 7th floor. The grills block the view and you dont get much light. I was kind of disappointed by this terrible view. <strong>Also the walls are Super thin. I can hear everything next door people are saying.&quot;</strong></h2>

<h2>&quot;One late night (more like 3am) I had to call security as there was a person passed out outside my room in the hallway. This wasn’t that big a deal to me. What was a big deal is I never received a call from management stating how sorry they were for the situation or offering some sort of comp like a buffet/waive resort fee, etc… I get that this is Vegas and people do dumb things and people passing out in the hallway while rare can occur. However, when a guest has to call security in the middle of the night to have people removed from outside their door as they are passed out is not really ok. No call or anything from anyone at the hotel after my call…….&quot;</h2>

&quot;A place to enjoy the prostitutes
<strong>Prostitution is everywhere, if you&#39;re gambling they will be all over you.
When you are going back to you room with your wife and kids they&#39;re are in the hallways or by the elevators.
They won&#39;t show you or your wife any respect.</strong>
I got approached by 3 prostitutes while wife went to the bathroom, they&#39;re very aggressive.
<strong>Mandalay Bay security were near by but did nothing, in fact 3 security officers were flirting with the prostitutes and the cocktail waitresses.</strong>
In one hour I was approached 5 times by different prostitutes, I left the Mizuya lounge earlier because was discussing to see security do nothing about theses prostitutes.
We were approached by a drug dealer also near the bathroom, we were told they had anything we want it.
<strong>Our bartender told us that security refuses to do their job and that the prostitutes are aware.</strong>
We stayed here for two nights, the bed sheets were stained, no free coffee, resorts fees are scams even if you don&#39;t use the pool or phone they still charge you mandatory resort fees, parking is not free, they will nickel and dime you for everything.</p>

<h2><strong>My rental car was broken in and they took our personal belongings out the trunk.&quot;</strong></h2>

<h2>&quot;OMG what a joke. First this hotel is older and dated, *<em>the airplane noise is horrible. All night long all you hear is planes flying over head, feels like the hotel is on the runway. *</em>On day two of my stay I came back to my room only to find my key did not work. After waiting 45 mins in the lobby I am told they checked me out of my room and checked someone else into it! How does this even happen???&quot;</h2>

<p>From Google:</p>

<p>5 months ago
&quot;I had about $500 in cash on me. I left my money clip on the table in the living room (we had a suite) near my phone which was charging and my son&#39;s phone. When I woke up at 630am, all of my cash was gone. Everything else including phones, laptops, cards IDs, etc were left untouched.</p>

<p><strong>My wife said she thought she heard someone come in around midnight. This person shined a phone flashlight around the suite and was gone within a minute. I did not hear or see anything. She thought she was dreaming and went back to sleep.</strong></p>

<p>I reported the robbery to Mandalay Bay security and they took statements from both of us. The resolution will take 7 to 10 business days. I do not expect to recover any money. Besides being disturbed by the actual robbery, it seems to me that the only suspect could be Mandalay Staff.</p>

<h2>As Security explained to me when my statement was taken, they (Security) have the only master keys in the house. If the door was ajar for more than 3 to 5 minutes, they would have been alerted through a system called Hot Sauce prompting a response. This alarm is audible so I would have heard it as well since I was up for an hour after I returned. There are no cameras in the hotel hallways as it is an invasion of privacy according to Security. If you must, deadbolt your door, put your valuables in the safe, or stuff the cash under your mattress. My experience seems like an inside job since there is no other explanation on how my suite could have been breached.&quot;</h2>

<h2>&quot;In my opinion, based on what I saw while at this resort, it is not a safe place to bring or stay with children. I have never written a review about anything but felt obligated in this case as the guardian of a 7 year old boy.  <strong>After what I saw I did some research and found they were fined 500k for drugs being sold on property. Google it. Place seems to be full of thugs, drugs and criminals.&quot;</strong></h2>

&quot;THIN walls. HORRIBLE hotel</p>

<h2>Not only were restaurants expensive and limited in choices, <strong>the walls in this hotel are paper thin. I could hear EVERYTHING through the walls. The last straw was the alarm going off next door for 10 min at 6 am. It sounded like it was right next to me!&quot;</strong></h2>

**&quot;Worst experience with a hotel in my life.
So I got to the resort after traveling all night. I checked in, went to my room, unpacked, and passed out. A few hours later I woke up to multiple hotel security personnel INSIDE MY ROOM slamming a flashlight on the mirror by the door. They were demanding to see my ID. They were extremely rude and had no empathy whatsoever. They took my wallet and grabbed my ID from it while I was in bed wondering why all this was happening. They said the room was listed as not having anyone in it, so obviously I was breaking in... After what seemed like a 15 minute conversation between the security guards and their bosses on the other side of the radio, they forced me to pack up my stuff to move to another room.</p>

<p>I can normally keep calm, and it&#39;s very rare that I get mad, but I completely lost it at this point. They didn&#39;t even tell the people on the radio that I was trying to sleep. They didn&#39;t even attempt to see if I could change rooms when I was done sleeping. It had to be right that second. They just kept saying there is an &quot;engineering issue&quot; with the room and I had to leave immediately. It was like they were expecting the room to blow up. So I got out of bed, packed my things, and then security escorted me to the room the front desk should have put me in from the start. They didn&#39;t even get me a working key card for the room.</p>

<p>So what was the issue with the room you ask? The front desk said the room wasn&#39;t clean, but it was 100% spotless.</p>

<p>They comp&#39;ed my resort fees and gave me a meal credit for the troubles, but it was nowhere near enough to give me a positive opinion of the resort. </p>

<h2>A note to the hotel... Instead of assuming someone broke into the room, why not assume there was a clerical error? You could have just called me on the room phone and asked why I was in the room. Instead you sicked your dogs on me like I&#39;m some sort of criminal.&quot;**</h2>

<p><strong>&quot;you can hear EVERYTHING from neighbours. We have listened to a baby scream for 2 nights straight. Simple convos between people you can also hear. We know exactly what our neighbours are doing daily &quot;</strong></p>

*<em>&quot;I was using the spa - as I did for the past four days - and upon returning to my locker, it was locked but wide open. Clearly, it has been pried open and missing were my shorts which contained my wallet, cash, and Rolex watch. *</em></p>

<p>Security (hotel, not Las Vegas PD) was notified and they arrived with no sense of urgency. I was handed a two page form and told to write down what happened. The officer snapped a few digital pictures and that was it. Spa employees not questioned, spa guests not interviewed, no finger printing, no searching the area to see if any evidence of the theft. The men&#39;s locker room is a secure area, so not like strangers were cycling in/out. Every guests is logged in/out. </p>

<p>It was evident someone used a screwdriver type of tool to pry open the locker. And mine was the only locker opened... which means the their knew exactly what he was doing. The marks on the wooden locker told the story. However, security never once counted the marks, or inspected them to determine how fresh they were. They were jagged and splintered. </p>

<p>The head of security arrived after I requested to meet. He explained the report would be filed with their investigation department and an investigate begin in 2-3 days. I was shocked. The spa has a central lobby and all guests logged in/out. They could have immediately run the tapes to determine which guests left carrying bags, etc. The security chief said he had done all he could do and it was up to Investigation Dept. I asked to meet with the head of that department and was told they were busy. I told them I would wait, but was again told they were busy. </p>

<h2>Wisely, I called LV Police Dept and filed a report. They were incredibly insightful and opened my eyes to the possibility of it being a staff member/ inside job since it was so targeted and happened within a quick 30 minute window while I was sitting in the hot tub. Not to mention other spa guests would not be carrying a screwdriver. &quot;</h2>

<h2>&quot;As the day progressed and a few drinks later and quite a bit of fun in the sun and the pools we found ourselves having to leave and went to pay the ever increasing bill but hey this is Vegas we were prepared. What we were not prepared for is for our wallet disappear. All the cash IDs, CCs and the rest as you can imagine was gone. With 2 people looking after our cabanna you would think thats would be a safe place to leave your belongings including a wallet which was inside a bag by the way. With some help from kind people outside of the pool, not that anyone at the resort tried to help.&quot;</h2>

<h2><strong>&quot;The incompetent staff checked people into my room, with my stuff still in the room.

Robbery at the Lazy River</p>

<h2>&quot;<strong>After a nice 3 night visit all of our possessions were stolen at the lazy river on our last day. The hotel refused to do anything. We were left with no IDs, credit card, clothes, shoes. Pretty messed up.&quot;</strong></h2>

<p><a href="http://beneaththeneon.com/">WITH SYMPATHY FROM SAN SALVADOR</a>: &quot;My thoughts are with everyone directly affected by this unspeakable tragedy and with my friends who live in an underground flood channel in the area. They often use the sidewalk between Mandalay Bay and the outdoor concert hall, pausing to enjoy a song or two from the far side of the fence. From second-hand sources, I heard they were cleared out of the drain as a precautionary measure. But I haven’t heard if they are all OK.</p>

<p>If you know any of these fine folks and you’ve heard from them, please let me know. I’ll do the same for you.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stayed at Mandalay in April of this year. Honestly, I didn’t think the walls were thin. I didn’t hear anything in the hallway or other rooms while there. It was during the week at a work conference so there were probably less drunkards. </p>

<p>I travel for work often and thought this place was nice, clean, quiet, etc. </p>

<p>My company did rent a two bedroom suite at the end of the hall. It was considered “renovated” and looked nothing like the pics of Paddock’s suite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my stays in nicer hotels, “suites” usually entail more privacy/more soundproof than a regular room that is not considered a super upgrade like a suite with a full living area/room and multiple bedrooms. </p>

<p>Makes sense to me that the high roller’s preferred rooms are more private due to successful individual’s drug/vacation/fetish habits are much looser than a regular than everyday people. </p>

<p>&quot;OMG what a joke. First this hotel is older and dated, *the airplane noise is horrible. All night long all you hear is planes flying over head, feels like the hotel is on the runway. *On day two of my stay I came back to my room only to find my key did not work. After waiting 45 mins in the lobby I am told they checked me out of my room and checked someone else into it! How does this even happen???&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yo this is real.  I stayed there for a convention in 2014, MGM Grand in Vegas.  I had just finished a 12 hour day when I went to get into my room.  It was the 2nd time my key stopped working and I was pissed so I started kicking the door lock.  A french guy opened the door who couldn&#39;t speak English and asked what I needed.  I threw him out of the way to go in and see his entire family in my room.  </p>

<p>His little kid was jumping on my bed.  The mom had unpacked all her toilet shit.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s fucking crazy.  ALL MY SHIT was still in the room right down to a giant ass bottle of Astro Glide.  Like the bottle you get at COSTCO.  </p>

<p>They had set my suit case over to the side, all my clothes still hanging in the closet.  But the wife had moved all my toilet shit and thrown it in the garbage.  </p>

<p>I got black out mad and tossed them out all out.  </p>

<p>Story gets worse.</p>

<p>To try and make up for this bullshit they say we are sending you a fruit basket.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m taking a hot ass bath when 2 hispanic dudes come walking into my room with a fruit basket.  Knock on the bathroom door and walk in with the fruit basket.  I just stood up and said they had like 3 fucking seconds to get out of my room.  If I knew I wouldn&#39;t have died slipping on the floor I would have fought them.  Nothing crazier than a man with his dick out fighting you.</p>

<p>They tried to make that shit up by giving me $50 dollars in chips.  </p>

<p>That made me even more mad, so I got some person who said they where in charge to comp me a 10 day suite at a later day.</p>

<p>When I went to redeem the suite it was only for select weekends, none of which the UFC was in town.</p>

<p>FUCK THESE CLOWNS.</p>
