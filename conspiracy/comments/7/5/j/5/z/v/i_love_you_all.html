<p>In all seriousness, you have summed up what is amazing about this sub.  Where else can you be part of a community that strives to make a collective effort to find truth.  A community where we aren&#39;t afraid to tackle the hidden evils of power.  A community that wants to show the uninitiated the lies that cover their eyes.  </p>

<p>There is a reason this sub has been polluted with $hills, it is because we are one of the few things that scares Them (and there is a Them), we are truthbringers.  </p>

<p>The Truthbringers have helped 60% of Americans question 9/11.   The Truthbringers affected an Presidental election and pervent a true tyrant from taking office (It wasn&#39;t the Russians, Hillary it was US).  The Truthbringers have exposed the Corporate media and has shown them for snakes that they are.  Most importantly, the Truthbringers have pulled back the veil of darkness that has protected the demons who amuses themselves by destroying the innocents of children. </p>

<p>We are the Truthbringers and we have a World to wake up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more decent people that feel this, think this, and act on it by verbalizing it, and living it, the better off we’ll all be.</p>

<p>I feel pretty much what you expressed...thank you. Anyone who is willing to politely listen to a new idea, or an opinion that is different from their own, then rationally consider it, and peacefully discuss or debate the subject so that all parties in the conversation can learn and grow from the experience (as opposed to tearing each other down), that’s a person I’m going to want to be around. Even if we completely disagree on everything. Maybe especially then, because at some point, every idea or notion we cling to was once new or different.</p>

<p>Aside from the very purpose of this sub, just boil it down to something really simple. If we tear down someone else, trying to utterly destroy them verbally...what are we really accomplishing? Is that person’s day any brighter? Are they any more likely to actually change their opinion on the subject? Is that time well spent? No, to all of it. Hell, it might make it even easier to pick out who the shills, fakes, and distractions are around here...and make it easier to ignore them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cooperation with each other is our secret weapon. This is what they fear most. That’s why they divide and conquer. The formula for cooperative power is N(squared) with N being the number if cooperaring participants. Imagine if the whole world united. This is also why Hollywood pushed egocentrism so hard. Egocentric people are as divided as it. They taught us to look up or down at each other instead of looking at each other as equals which is actually reality. Once we shake off the spell, we will enter a new golden age of man. </p>
