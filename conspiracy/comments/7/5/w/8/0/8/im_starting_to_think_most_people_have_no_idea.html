<p>When he ran is 2012 he would speak to stadiums of 10-20K college students all over the nation. He spoke in detail of the federal reserve and why we need to audit/end it.</p>

<p>Maybe the idea that we are trillions of dollars in debt to a multinational banking cartel who runs every government on earth is too much for most people to handle, so they sub-consciously reject it.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s all the fluoride in the tap water and aluminum in the air blocking their penial gland, making them docile and compliant.</p>

Somehow these people get so emotionally attached to their beliefs that mentioning the fed is not government challenges them and their cognitive dissonance is literally painful.

<p>I understand now as I spent a day at KPMGs head office in SYD for uni. All they did was talk about first class working conditions (not terms) and how forward thinking they are and blah blah blah. </p>

<p>They do have a nice office though taking the top 7 or 8 floors of a 40 story building over looking the Darling Harbour. However, When I spoke to their &quot;leaders&quot; they were creeps and you could the women that worked for them had sold their souls. It reminded me of this scene <a href="https://youtu.be/CfGIeNALguE">https://youtu.be/CfGIeNALguE</a> in the movie 300.</p>

If you can stomach potential 80 hr work weeks without any additional compensation of appreciation for it, go for it.

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point in it being like that is so that the Fed is not controlled by any single branch of governement, creating an economic regulatory body that is independent from political agendas and allows for a stable economy outside of the politics of the rest of our government while still being subject to limited oversight from the Federal Governement. Would you really want the President crafting interest rates and fucking with the banking industry? It&#39;s actually recipe for disaster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s more right than you are. No one owns the fed, publicly or privately, but at the end of the day it&#39;s authority to exist sits with the United States government. It&#39;s treated as an independent entity in order to not politicize the economy, but it is fundamentally tied to the government. To say otherwise is to be flat out wrong. Do some non-conspiracy research into how a central bank works and you will realize that they are not some kind of boogeyman and that the anti-fed narrative is actually only there to serve the banks who are chafed by their controls and regulations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Fed expressly cannot loan to the government. Older CBs were able to do this and it had terrible implications so they don&#39;t allow it. The government sells the FED treasury bonds but that is totally different, that&#39;s technically an investment not a loan and has an interest basically equal to inflation (only slightly higher because of time value of money)</p>

<p>The loaning the FED does is at the discount window to banks, with collateral, who are solvent but are too illiquid to borrow on the overnight market.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a ton of misconceptions of the fed mostly from people&#39;s lack of understanding that printing cash and creating money are completely unrelated and that the Feds interact almost complete with only banks, the only interaction with gov is purchasing T bills that it can use to regulate money supply by influencing the reserves banks hold vs the reserves they loan out (banks are the ones who ACTUALLY create money)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s not true. I&#39;ve <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/73mt6k/representative_mcfadden_says_the_federal_reserve/dnsl0zk">pointed out to you before</a> that the law specifies who owns the Federal Reserve Banks.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure after reading that you went and looked for evidence that the Rothschilds owned the Federal Reserve and found ... nothing. Because it&#39;s a hoax.</p>

<p>Or are you really so willfully ignorant that you didn&#39;t even bother to check on your beliefs?</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t gotten through many, but I&#39;ve read about incidents of theft, sketchy situations where they frame innocent employees, liberty &quot;war&quot; bonds, how they profit from the government&#39;s economical downfalls etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Rothschilds were the richest banking family of the nineteen century. Some of the stories about them are true and some are false. You have to actually examine each claim separately. Just because you hear  &quot;Rothschild&quot; and &quot;bank&quot; in the same sentence does not automatically mean the sentence is true.</p>

<p>By the way, the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th pictures you give are about David and Louis Rothschild. I had never heard about them before tonight, but I researched them and, guess what, they&#39;re not from the European banking family. They are from a Cleveland, Ohio furniture family, maker of bar and restaurant fixtures. David Rothschild was sent to prison in New York and died there.</p>

<p>For some questions about Rothschilds or banking, it&#39;s hard to tell what the truth is. The question about who owns the Federal Reserve is not a difficult question, though. It&#39;s written into the law.</p>

<p>The people who claim that it&#39;s really the Rothschilds are never able to present any real evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only issue with this post is that the Fed expressly cannot loan to the government. Older CBs were able to do this and it had terrible implications so they don&#39;t allow it. The government sells the FED treasury bonds but that is totally different, that&#39;s technically an investment not a loan and has an interest basically equal to inflation (only slightly higher because of time value of money)</p>

<p>The loaning the FED does is at the discount window to banks, with collateral, who are solvent but are too illiquid to borrow on the overnight market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t believe you becuase you are  more or less wrong and I&#39;ll informed. The Fed is a quasi-governemental entity that is under governmental oversight but operates and makes decisions independently.  No one owns it, it does not have shareholders, or make profits, it is essentially the an e onomic regulatory entity and the bank for banks, who have to settle up with it every day to keep things on the level. Seriously get your info from reliable sources, shit even Wikipedia, instead of conspiracy videos and you will realize how fucking boring the Federal Reserve actually is. They are too cozy with the banks they are supposed to be keeping in check but otherwise it&#39;s not what you think it is.</p>
