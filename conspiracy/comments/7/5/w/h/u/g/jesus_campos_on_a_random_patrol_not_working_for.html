        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why wouldn&#39;t the friend raising $40k on <a href="https://imgur.com/a/puFvj">gofundme</a> for him say he was &quot;WORKING FOR MANDALAY BAY SECURITY&quot; when he got shot? </p>

<p>Because he wasn&#39;t. He&#39;s a licensed security working for Contemporary Services Corporation that does exclusively EVENT security.  They are the yellow shirt guards at the concert. They are not employed by the hotel EXCEPT for conventions and conferences, which was not going on at the hotel.</p>

<p>This explains why Campos didn&#39;t have a hotel radio.</p>

<p>It explains why he lied about his story at first that he was there after the shooting to take out Paddock. </p>

<p>An event security guard, on a random patrol, should not be up inside the hotel while his company is running security for the concert across the street.</p>

<p>Edits: Great comments that I&#39;ll bump up here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>@eg2107 points out  &quot;Explains why he wasn&#39;t in the MB employee database&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Many have doubted that Larry Jesus Campos worked for CSC and that he is the same Jesus Campos. He&#39;s in the Nevada Private Investigator database and the gofundme confirms he works for CSC. You have to go through the names of the contributors and their comments to make sense of that, which I did. The comments of contributors confirm that Jesus is the same person as Larry and that he does in fact work for CSC.</p></li>
<li><p>Why would the hotel distance themselves from this person if he is a &quot;hero&quot; and he was working for them? He was not. The mere fact that the hotel has never once said he was employed by or contracted by them leaves them room to deny completely that he had any right to be there. When the lawsuits start flying the hotel will run from this guy.</p></li>
<li><p>Hotel statement refutes Campos two timelines. &quot;“We know that shots were being fired at the festival lot at the same time as, or within 40 seconds after, the time Jesus Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio,” MGM said in the statement, released by a public relations firm. “Metro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio.”&quot; <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/las-vegas-hotel-owners-dispute-police-timeline-say-there-was-no-gap-between-report-of-gunshots-massacre-20171012.html">source</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Edit:</p>

<ol>
<li>Larry Jesus Campos CSC security guard license <a href="https://imgur.com/a/r4ytx">here</a>. Until there&#39;s proof this is not Jesus Campos we&#39;re talking about who&#39;s been idendified as the security guard confirmed making a &quot;random patrol&quot; in a hotel he&#39;s not employed, it is him.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Tuckers show ended with the assumption the Campos interview was going to air. Reason is the entire ending of tuckers show was a perfect lead in to the interview. He flat out said things are just too weird and too much mystery and was on this rare occasion open to alternate storylines. Once that ended my hype for the interview was getting good then bam the commercial announcing for first time anywhere that the exclusive interview was coming next. One big blue ball is blue and size of earth and the other size of Neptune.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Matt Lauer: What happened when the police arrived, Stephen, we&#39;re you still there?</p>

<p>Stephen Schuck: I was still there, yes, uh, we kind of were directing them like &#39;It&#39;s this hallway, at the end of the hallway.&#39; Um, me and uh, Jesus... we never saw the door open, so we thought he was shooting from the peephole in the door. We were just telling police that, and then, my supervisor was there, he handed me his master keys, and I ran down and shut off all the guest elevators, and stopped guests on the uh, basement floor. Just let em know &#39;we have an incident upstairs, you know, stay down here.&#39; And then I made my way back up to the 32nd floor to give him his keys so he could give them to the police, so they could use them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure how I missed that before, I must&#39;ve blocked that out while listening because it makes no sense. </p>

<p>Like, did the supervisor arrive with the police, before the police, after the police? Why didn&#39;t the supervisor shut the elevators off himself? </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing the maintenance keys are analog/metal keys, different from the electronic master room key, but security guards wouldn&#39;t also have one of those analog keys (I mean what if there&#39;s a power outage?)</p>

<p>And I think the part that&#39;s hardest for me to comprehend with this new testimony is that he says he was with the police, directing them to the room... yet Undersheriff McMahill said on his radio interview Tuesday that they didn&#39;t find out about the maintenance worker until they finally got around to interviewing him a few days ago (because there were so many others they had to interview first). How was he not a priority interviewee? That might make sense if he&#39;d never interacted with the police during the incident, but he should have been mentioned in the first responding officers&#39; police reports, and therefore interviewed immediately. It just doesn&#39;t make sense that he was unknown to the police for a week after the incident, after hailing Jesus Campos a hero for being present, offering up his master key, evacuating guests, etc., if there was a second employee there doing the exact same thing. I&#39;m not buying it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That story leads me to believe Campos and the maintenance guy retreated to the other hallway and waited for hotel security.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t get, (and we havent really heard Hotel security dispatch yet so until that comes out we can only speculate) hotel security seems to be on the 32nd floor during the shots being fired portion of the incident.  Why didn&#39;t they react?  They&#39;re armed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Used to work in a hotel, 2 actually, and our guest room doors didn&#39;t have alarms. That struck me as VERY odd. I&#39;m not even sure what kind of alarm it would be. The door being open too long? (Maybe to prevent people from accidentally leaving their door slightly open when they thought it clicked shut). But that would mean guest door alarms would go off frequently when people are transferring luggage in and out, or stepping outside briefly to take a phone call, etc. </p>

<p>My first instinct was that it was some sort of maintenance or service door, possibly fire escape door, that would have an alarm that goes off. All of our doors to off-limits areas for guests were protected by having us swipe our employee ID cards to get in. I don&#39;t think they were alarmed - they were locked so even if someone tried to get in who wasn&#39;t a worker, there were no alarms that would go off..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The type of alarm that would be triggered by a door being open is what the Access Control industry calls a Door Held Open alarm. This would require a door contact on the door and is generally set to 30 seconds. There are usually settings to extend this &quot;Held Open&quot; timer to be as long as you wanted it to be. So as an example if the door is opened from the inside (giving a Request to Exit) it could be set for 30 seconds. Where presenting your card (getting Access Granted) would trigger the time to be more like 1-2 minutes.</p>

<p>This type of configuration requires a Door Contact and a Request To Exit device (potentially in the door handle, these can also be motion, think about the door opening at grocery store). I do not believe hotel rooms have this hardware (although high roller suits might?).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plus the police unit that entered the room said they removed the barricade device with a crowbar. First question  was it supposedly an emergency door? It would have alerted control when he went out it, then perhaps installed his barricade device, took the stairs down or up a floor then took the elevator back to his floor to continue his preparations. Control could had dispatched maintenence and security to check the alarm then this would explain why he fired on security, afraid they would discover the door had been tampered with and alert police before he could begin. Also, why a door secured shut would send a open door alarm to control. Not sure why they would say it was a smoke detector though.</p>

That&#39;s an infraction, and can get you a write-up &amp; maybe suspension or termination.

    <div class="md"><p>I would posit, there may be multiple people named Jesus Campos. Possibly even together in Vegas on the same night. The CSC guard lived in Fontana. No way he&#39;s running back and forth to Vegas 4-5 times a week for work. And On Scene Security, the team allegedly protecting Campos&#39; house, is a Nevada company likely not licensed to have a guard in California. If he was in CA, he&#39;d have to have a local company supporting him. </p>

<p>My money is on this being another Boston Bomber thing where reddit thinks they found the dude but it&#39;s someone totally unrelated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The maintenance man was the one dispatched to the fire alarm door as would be the normal situation, generally a guest uses it by mistake rather than walking to the elevator or wants to get some exercise not realizing the stairwell is emergency exit only. </p>

<p>The maintenance man came under fire as he got off the elevator. </p>

<p>The shooting stopped and Campos peaked out from behind an alcove telling the maintenance man to take cover and that &quot;someone was shooting&quot;.</p>

<p>Campos killed Paddock and shot himself in the leg as a cover, then he saw on the video monitor the maintenance man was coming off the elevator fucking up his clean escape because he was still in the room, so he opened fire, missing him. </p>

<p>Now knowing the maintenance man was still alive and radioing for help, Campos peaks out from an alcove and tells him to &quot;take cover&quot; according to the maintenance guy. </p>

<p>Another interesting thing is the reports of multiple witnesses that event security had closed off multiple entry/exit points that were open the previous days of the concert. Concert goers remarked how the places they entered with their passes before were now closed by chain link fence and they had to walk around the venue to enter. </p>

<p>Possibly multiple members of the security team are radicalized, most of them are immigrants or come from immigrant families and may feel a certain type of way about this country, especially white, largely conservative country music fans. </p>

<p>Paddock may have been in on it, he had multiple burner phones to coordinate the attack or give to his accomplices. He was used as the guy who could deliver the weapons and explosives, the room, not raise any red flags etc, with them knowing all along he was going to be the fall guy. </p>

<p>The guns and explosives in the car were for the other security team members, but they never planned to participate in the attack other than locking certain gates making it harder for people to escape, this wouldn&#39;t incriminate them at all. First of all why would anyone suspect security when a crazed gunman is shooting from a hotel suite? Secondly it&#39;s totally reasonable to close gates and claim that too many people were coming in and out the last couple of days and it was too hard to keep track of who had legit passes. </p>

<p>TLDR Multiple members of the security force are part of a terror plot, Paddock was brought in as a lonely bitter old man who could get them what they needed and take the fall OR perhaps Paddock was just trying to sell them the guns for a big profit not knowing of the attack, either way he was setup. </p>

<p>So you don&#39;t have to cite sources for your claims, but when I ask for a source for them that means I am now asserting the opposite assumption, for which I have to cite my sources for? Am I getting this right? I have to search google to find information that proves you wrong because you can&#39;t cite a single piece of evidence for your claims?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or maybe they just hand out room passes and hotel radios to random strangers...</p>

<p>Not sure where you&#39;re getting this from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And maybe the other mandalay employee present only recognized him as an emplyee he knew because the deep state paid him under the table....right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think the entities capable of carrying out an attack like this and then pinning it on someone else would be incapable of paying a hotel worker to lie about it? You were just capable of assuming, for the sake of argument, that Campos is compromised and complicit in the murder of 60 people, but the idea of the people behind that paying another worker to corroborate the story is apparently beyond what you can believe...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you reach this hard for everything in your life hoping it turns out in your favor?</p>

<p>TIL that citing that the Nevada Board of Private Investigators is not an employee database for a hotel in Las Vegas is reaching. It is also reaching to ask <a href="/r/replicant__3">/r/replicant__3</a> for a source for his claims, however I need a source for things I have not said.</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing nothing but the cold hard facts to this wacko lunatic sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wanna play devil&#39;s advocate and point out that just because he was a contracted security guard for AN EVENT doesn&#39;t necessarily mean he was contracted for Route 91. Vegas is a busy city with lots of conferences all the time. Each hotel has it&#39;s own huge conference center. He may have been contracted for something inside Mandelay Bay. Do you know for SURE nothing was going on at the hotel that day?

<p>Wrong. I do look at MSM, but only as one type of source of many-- and note, they were not reporting accurately on the details of Campos and don&#39;t have a monopoly on reporting, research and investigation. So people also look at a variety of other sources &amp; theories.  This is a forum where alternate theories are discussed based on available evidence. Often theories are discussed as possibilities even if unproven.</p>

This &quot;security guard&quot; who we apparently now going to assume was actually working the event across the street.. &quot;Overrhears a random prostitute&quot; that ends up being the biggest whistle blower of all time mind you and takes it upon himself to walk across the street by himself.. Mosey on up to the 32nd floor just to be shot by &quot;paddock&quot; thats the logical reasoning you come up with really?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok here goes. I don’t have any solid evidence or sources to back this up, but there are a few things being conjectured here that I will refute. I live in Vegas, and for some time have done some contracted non-security work so here goes: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If Campos was working the concert venue, then he had no business at the hotel. These security guys who work these events are mostly there for crowd control, maybe to enforce some disputes with policies from the event honchos etc. , not there for any investigative function whatsoever. They don’t make much bank. Most are either power junkies who get off in a little authority, or someone who is a wannabe law enforcement officer, or filling in to make extra money to support family. They usually don’t get full time hours. The work is sporadic. So the notion that he left to follow up on the crazy we-are-all-gonna-die lady is not true. He would not have been asked to do that. If he took that upon himself to do he would most likely be putting his job on the line. </p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, if he was working AT (not FOR) the MB to do security for the net app convention coming on Monday. He would be there to mostly keep people moving in the right direction, and more to keep attendees out of areas they aren’t supposed to be in. That’s their main function for a convention event. Mostly a supplement to hotel security, who have a broader responsibility. </p></li>
<li><p>Regarding that he was actually working for the MB. There is usually a non recruitment clause or understanding between the hotels and personnel contracting firms. A whole big process you have to go through if you want to leave a contracting firm. Not sure if this is an unwritten understanding, but it’s something you get indoctrinated into if you work many of these events. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>All this to say that his presence on the 32nd floor is totally unwarranted based on what I know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cSC website lists many services offered beyond event security - including guests services. </p>

<p>For the record, I brought the ‘license’ thing into this house and made sure that on all threads I introduced the topic (4 maybe 5) I went back to clarify my initial mistake: I searched the licensed guard data, but failed to see the registered guard data. There are two levels of guard registry. Another user found that detail and started a thread (that got archived for doxxing) on the topic. </p>

<p>I apologize for the confusion my mistake caused and would ask that if you read a post miss-stating the facts, clarify it. And FFS don’t post the inaccuracy as a fact. Please and thanks. </p>

<p>I’d like to clarify that:
The entry subject to the thread started by Elesium was always in the records, it was not added after the existence of said records was questioned. </p>

<p>CSC offers more than just event security so its no stretch that they may have been contracted by MB resort. </p>

<p>It has not been verified whether the entry for Larry Jesus represents Jesus Campos referenced by LEO and MSM</p>

<p>It is spooky AF that the media appears largely OK with nothing more than mentioning a name of a key figure vs. their typical overzealous effort to get a story or interview. I swore I heard an advert this AM on FOX saying Hannity was going to interview the security guard tonight at 9, but can’t find anything on FOX or Hannity media to confirm. </p>

<p>We are on to something, but lets do our best to fact check and confirm sources and work together on that. To that regard, h/t to user Elesium for finding my error</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thx, appreciate the nod.</p>

<p>For reference - I worked in operations for this type of firm previously or I would never have thrown my hat into these conversations. I can&#39;t vouch for CSC or what their version of guest services entails, but I know from experience that hotel security (roaming halls, checking doors, yelling at little kids running around screaming etc) is certainly within the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>But - at the end of the day I&#39;m just speculating, so I&#39;m gonna drop it at that.</p>

<p>PS - Hannity is indeed advertising that he&#39;s talking to the security guard tonight at 9. I have my dvr set......</p>

<p>It is a very big stretch. Look up gaming control regulations for casino security. If he was in MB, as alleged, with keys, as alleged, he was working for Mandalay Bay. He was not contracted, because every security guard that has access to a gaming space or back of house area must be licensed by the gaming control board, and they don&#39;t license contractors. </p>

<p>Find a gaming registration for him, not a PILB license, and then your argument holds a bit more weight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good call out of the state codification of gaming, but hospitality is not the same as gaming is not the same as security. Having access to guest facilities does not mean you have brass keys or keys to the castle - it means you have access to hospitality operations.</p>

<p>Definitely want to hat/tip for challenging me - because it pushed me to dig further - found several articles that pointed out MB is the first casino in Nevada that has Unionized security - they organized and joined SPFPA last December. If, and at this point its a big if - Mr. Campos was on direct payroll, he likely was part of that union. Maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s mum on details. </p>

<p>Ironically - watched the full hour of the Hannity program on Fox last night because they advertised that the host was going to interview Campos - but the entire show covered Weinstein mess - not a peep about the hero security guard. Grrr....</p>

<p>From Nevada Code:
NRS 648.013  “Private patrol officer” defined.  “Private patrol officer” means a person engaged in the business of employing and providing for other persons watchmen, guards, patrol officers, uniformed officers to control traffic, bodyguards or other persons for the purpose of protecting persons or property, including armored transport, to prevent the theft, loss or concealment of property of any kind or to investigate the theft, loss or concealment of property the private patrol officer has been hired to protect.
 NRS 648.0155  “Security consultant” defined.  “Security consultant” means a person licensed as a private patrol officer or private investigator who engages in the business of furnishing advice on the proper methods and equipment for providing security and protection for persons and property.</p>

<p>It was never smoke. The sheriff refuted that rumor (which was born out of a witness interview on CNN) in one of the very first briefings. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>then it was a fire escape alarm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was never the story. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>then it was a door open alarm, </p>

<p>Correct, but before this the story was that Paddock&#39;s door was ajar and Campos just happened to stumble upon it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>then it was a blocked door that set off an alarm. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was never the story either, at least not an official one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Totally fabricated. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fairness, if you rewatch the press briefings, the various open door/door alarm stories can easily be explained by minor misunderstandings of a vague testimony. And I say this as someone who was so suspicious of the changing security guard stories that I began compiling a list of direct quotes from all the police briefings related to the evolving first responder and security guard stories (which I&#39;ll post here soon). What they actually said related to open doors and alarms isn&#39;t all that different... The major differences came from how we interpreted each version and the scenarios we conjured in our minds as a result. </p>

<p>What&#39;s indisputably shady about it though is 1.) how the security guard story is always the part of the briefing that the sheriff seems least confident in discussing, 2.) that the security guard&#39;s story doesn&#39;t match the police scanner audio, 3.) that the police scanner audio makes it sound like the police were surprised to discover a wounded security guard already on the 32nd floor, and 4.) this mysterious new maintenance worker who was apparently present for the whole thing but the police only just heard about now. </p>

Its all make believe and even we are eating it up like they knew we would while they prep for War with Iran.. Smh NOW they will prolly release the terrorism connection and claim they were somehow connected to Iran.. </p>

I wonder if Campos, who was supposedly working as event security, was the one who escorted her out... wouldn’t that be considered “random patrol”? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Good to know. I&#39;m 99.9% sure our rooms did not have those - they would have explained this to us in training, so we would know what a room door alarm sounds like, and so that we would know what to tell security/maintenance when we called them to report the issue. We had something like a couple thousand rooms, (I don&#39;t remember the exact number), including suites that run several thousand $$ a night. Maybe Vegas hotels are different? Who knows.</p>

<p>Funny how you guys will be anything and everything EXCEPT msm.</p>

<p>Wrong. I do look at MSM, but only as one type of source of many-- and note, they were not reporting accurately on the details of Campos and don&#39;t have a monopoly on reporting, research and investigation. So people also look at a variety of other sources &amp; theories.  This is a forum where alternate theories are discussed based on available evidence. Often theories are discussed as possibilities even if unproven.</p>
