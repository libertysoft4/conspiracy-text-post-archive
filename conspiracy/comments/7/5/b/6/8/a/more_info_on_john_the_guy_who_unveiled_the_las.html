<p>That page also has the Fairport Chief of Police on video talking about it.</p>

<p>If you do research on John Beilman, you will find a lot of connections between stuff he worked on and the government. It just adds credibility to the stuff he was posting on 4chan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a bit behind in catching up on research.  Can you pass on a link where an article describes exactly what kind of phone charger it is?  I can&#39;t seem to find one.  They all just say that they found a phone charger that didn&#39;t match - but then stop short of saying what kind of charger it was.  I&#39;m just wondering where the connection comes in that it is THIS particular charger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t found much on the phone charger, but I also haven&#39;t researched that angle yet. Here&#39;s what we know about the charger:</p>

<ul>
<li>Police state additional charger is found in room</li>
<li>Charger does not belong to any phones owned by Paddock</li>
<li>Police later reverse course and say that the charger actually belonged to Paddock</li>
<li>4chan makes claim charger is related/used by SF &amp; CIA***</li>
</ul>

<p>*** Again, I haven&#39;t researched the 4chan claim of the SF/CIA correlation. It&#39;s possible there&#39;s one, but it&#39;s also possible there isn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know yet</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply.  Yes, that&#39;s the leap I&#39;m not willing to take.  I need a source or link to something where it was stated what type of charger this specifically was.  Did 4Chan just assume it had to be this type because of an article about a suspicious murder/suicide of a guy named John (who did indeed engineer this type of thing) that happened to fit the narrative of a bit of &quot;insider info&quot; they seemed to have gotten?  I&#39;m happy to research this further - but as of right now... it&#39;s a leap too far to make this connection without knowing how this phone charger was said to be the one that &quot;John&quot; engineered came into being a known fact as being the odd phone charger in Paddock&#39;s room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No? How about you click the links I provided and arrive at your own conclusions.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is that a &quot;-john&quot; predicted this attack and there&#39;s another John (John Beilman) with an extensive government/military background that is visited by the FBI... and then kills himself to the back of the head w/ a 12-gauge shotgun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I will admit that I hadn&#39;t looked fully at the linkedin profil before, I just saw he worked at GM, but I went back and looked again and saw lower down the job with ultralife, which I didn&#39;t see originally. Sorry about that. So okay now I am more convinced. I was very very suspicious at first because I saw where this story originally came from, and it was from a website that has put out so much fake news, and I get worried that the more fake news sites like that and their stories get promoted, the more it will discredit the actual truth.</p>

<p>But I must say I am surprised, and you are right it does seem fishy. I&#39;m really sorry for being so dismissive, I did exactly what I get annoyed at other people for doing, just based on my bias about that original website I saw the same story on earlier. I guess it&#39;s another reminder to never take anything for granted and to always check more thoroughly and not let pre-conceptions run away with me. So I am really sorry about that, you obviously put some work into finding this stuff out, so thanks. I feel bad now.</p>

<p>Also feel intrigued - it&#39;s not totally convincing that there&#39;s a connection and I haven&#39;t seen anywhere other than the dodgy website saying he was shot in the back of the head. But yeah it could do with more investigation and does seem a bit fishy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t know anything about this guy.  There is not one shred of evidence to suggest that he is, in any way, connected to LV.  I would encourage people to go look at his LinkedIn.  The guy made a career out of working with plastics.  Starting with molds, gradually working his way up to an engineering position at GM.  At no point was he the &#39;lead engineer&#39; on anything, let alone personally responsible for what he may or may not have designed plastic encasements for.</p>

<p>Second, there is only one horrible source that&#39;s ID&#39;d the charger left in his room.  That same source says that the charger was for, in their own words, a &quot;NON-chargeable&quot; battery.</p>

<p>For the past 5 years, he had been working at GM and being a caretaker for his daughter.  Not one shred of evidence suggesting he was a &#39;witness&#39;, as the horrible source claims, to the shootings, let along tangentially related to the events.</p>

<p>This is silly and a distraction from legitimate holes in the Las Vegas story.</p>

<ul>

<li>John Beilman also worked at Ultralife. Ultralife specializes in lithium ion batteries and phone chargers for military and civilian purposes</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Not alarmed at all.  I&#39;ve just not seen one legitimate connection between this guy and Paddock.</p>

<p>The rumor going around NY, where he lived, is that the investigation is related to recent child porn busts.  </p>

<p>The problem with this whole theory is that there isn&#39;t any valid confirmation that anything of Paddock&#39;s was Ultralife.  Except for a couple of really, really sketchy sources.  BUT even if it was true, how on earth does a plastics guy who worked on components for a wide range of applications, become privy to a secret mass shooting plot? </p>

<p>How do you not see the massive coincidences here? I&#39;ll repeat myself: Dude named john predicts this whole thing. Then there&#39;s another dude named John who directly enginerreed/developed military radio used by USSOCOM. Funny enough, the same John has ALSO worked at a company providing lithiuom ion batteries and phone chargers for the military/civilians.</p>

<p>Oh and lets add another funny thing. The FBI searches his house and the next day he kills himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This tactic is pretty common here.  I suppose it is to suggest that I am a shill, worried about the truth coming out?</p>

<p>If a dude was anonymously dropping info on 4chan, which is funny in itself, why would he use his real name?  And, again, how does a plastics guy who has worked at GM the past 5 years get swept into a mass shooting to the point where he is a &#39;key witness&#39;? </p>

<p>Yeah, he killed himself after an FBI search.  Which definitely lends credence to local rumors that he was caught up in a child porn ring that had been getting busted.  But your argument is that, since the FBI was involved and he committed murder/suicide, that has to make him suspect to the LV plot?  That&#39;s silly.</p>

Maybe it&#39;s true, but there isn&#39;t any evidence. The only confirmed things are that a guy called john was raided by the FBI and was found dead along with his daughter a couple of days later. Literally the ONLY thing &#39;connecting&#39; him to the LV shooting is the fact that his name was John, and someone calling themselves john made a prediction about an attack of some kind happening in las vegas. And that does not count as a connection because so many people are called john, and there&#39;s no telling whether the 4chan john&#39;s name was actually john anyway!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I will admit that I hadn&#39;t looked fully at the linkedin profil before, I just saw he worked at GM, but I went back and looked again and saw lower down the job with ultralife, which I didn&#39;t see originally. Sorry about that. So okay now I am more convinced. I was very very suspicious at first because I saw where this story originally came from, and it was from a website that has put out so much fake news, and I get worried that the more fake news sites like that and their stories get promoted, the more it will discredit the actual truth.</p>

<p>But I must say I am surprised, and you are right it does seem fishy. I&#39;m really sorry for being so dismissive, I did exactly what I get annoyed at other people for doing, just based on my bias about that original website I saw the same story on earlier. I guess it&#39;s another reminder to never take anything for granted and to always check more thoroughly and not let pre-conceptions run away with me. So I am really sorry about that, you obviously put some work into finding this stuff out, so thanks. I feel bad now.</p>

<p>Also feel intrigued - it&#39;s not totally convincing that there&#39;s a connection and I haven&#39;t seen anywhere other than the dodgy website saying he was shot in the back of the head. But yeah it could do with more investigation and does seem a bit fishy.</p>
