B- Have you ever tried to just kick off your boots? It&#39;s not that easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some questions and concerns:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Det. Casey Clarkson is at the concert and gets hit with shrapnel.  Casey states that he was getting light headed and his partner was worried.  Who is his partner? Casey says he stayed to help dispite his wounds, where does he go?</p></li>
<li><p>Sgt Joshua Bitsko and Dave Newton are k9 unit dog trainers.  It states they were training dogs when the call went out.  JOSH claims he said this&quot;I just yell to these guys, &quot;lets go. Ther is an active shooter.&quot; Who are &quot;these guys&quot;? If he was with other officers why did only Dave Newton come with him?  Also they had to drive 5 min down the expressway.  lets assume 60 mph at 5 min lets say they were from 5 to 10 miles away, how were they there as first responders when so far away?</p></li>
<li><p>Det. Matt Donaldson says he was doing paperwork at HQ.  He was roughly 9 miles away.  Why was he there before anyone else? what about Det. Clarkson and his partner? where did they go in the time it took for Donaldson and the k9 guys to get there?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did guys who were so far respond first? Las Vegas doesnt have cops closer to the strip? A detective nearly 10 miles from the scene was a first responder even though there were plenty of other las vegas police already there? Did they not get the training the sheriff speaks of? Shouldnt police on the scene have made this ad hic swat team before these guys showed up? Im just asking questions here.</p></li>
<li><p>Levi Hancock the swat team member.  Why was he the only swat member there? wouldnt there be more swat with him when he showed up? do they areive at the scene as they can? Also the door to the stairwell was barricaded, guess who just happened to have a crow bar? the door that need to be blown open, guess who has charges just for this!? it is odd to me that ine swat guy shows up and has wverything needed to &quot;take the shooter down&quot;.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am simply asking questions here based off the article.</p>
