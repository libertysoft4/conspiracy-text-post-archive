        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The OP said that there were gunshots on his floor, and when he exited his room, he met a security guard who was on the phone with his wife/girlfriend who told him to go back to his room. Elevators were shut down and his keycard did not work to open the staircase, so he was stuck on the same floor as the shooter.</p>

<p>The issue is I cannot find the original thread. I remember seeing it a couple of hours before the Las Vegas Strip Shooting, around 9 or 10 PM Central Time, which was 2 hours before the shooting. </p>

<p>Wrong, I worked at places that had staircases which were locked, because it was a different department, unused, a service staircase, or for other reasons</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve worked in hotels for over 15 years. There are multiple reasons besides fire that guests would need quick, unobstructed access to the exits. You can&#39;t require that they be cognitive enough to remember their key in the event of an emergency. Hell, those keys stop working all the time, get programmed for wrong amount of days etc. </p>

<p>No stairway would be locked in any fashion from the interior ever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Found it.   It was in Vegas shooting mega thread that was on front page and in the news sub. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m there now. As in, in the hotel. Checked in not 20 minutes before the shooting started. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was looking out my window when I heard the gunfire and saw the flashing. My first thought was &quot;huh, that&#39;s gunfire&quot;. I&#39;ve seen it and heard it many times. Then a pause and my brain was saying &quot;nah, too many rounds, must be construction&quot;. Then more gunfire.  Pause, more.  Pause.  More.  Pause.  More... for a good two minutes. </p>

<p>At that point I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s a jackhammer.  I&#39;m thinking &quot;crap, who&#39;s doing work this late. Well, off to get food&quot;. </p>

<p>Elevators weren&#39;t working not two minutes after I heard the gunfire. Buttons didn&#39;t even light up. After about five minutes, I tried three stairway doors.  Keycard didn&#39;t work.  Now I&#39;m thinking something is up. Tried the hallway phone and waited on hold for ten minutes. Went back to my room and heard the helicopters. Looked out at a road full of red and blue flashers. </p>

<p>Oh. Those were gunshots!  Turned on TV... yep. Wait, FROM the Mandalay...  </p>

<p>About that time I heard a maintenance guy in the hallway telling his wife he&#39;s safe and on floor (mine) and that someone on 32 blew out their window and was spraying down into the concert crowd. He saw me and said to get back in my room. Confirmed hotel is in total lockdown. </p>

<p>Just a few minutes ago, the cops swept through the floor. You could hear their radios. Must have been three. They stopped at my door, banged on it, announced it was the police, said they heard the TV and asked my name. I gave it, didn&#39;t open the door.  I heard one of the others say &quot;confirmed&quot; and they banged on the door across the hall, did the same, got their name and moved on. </p>

<p>That surprised me. It was a good hour after the gunfire. </p>

<p>Even most of the cruisers had moved on by then. Copters are a few streets over.  </p>

<p>I wonder if the NetApp Insight conference is on for this morning...</p>
