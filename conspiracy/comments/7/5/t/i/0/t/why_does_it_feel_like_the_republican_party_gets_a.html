        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This sub seems wholly obsessed with shitting on Democrats and Clinton (which has it&#39;s place) even though Trump and Republicans have literally sold out to every big money interest in washington: wall st, big oil/coal, private prisons, nra, pharmaceutical companies, telecoms, military industry, etc. Those used to be the conspiracies we talked about here. <strong>Follow the money</strong>. Question those in power. I am not saying Democrats arent bad as well but when was the last time you saw a post here about the corruption of the RNC, the numerous sex scandals on the right or data literally being scrubbed from EPA websites. All I wish is that the Republican party which runs all three branches of government got the same amount of scrutiny as Democrats get here. Also if you really thing both parties are equal I suggest comparing this subs values with congressional voting records: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6pc5qu/democrats_propose_rules_to_break_up_broadband/dkon8t4/">https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6pc5qu/democrats_propose_rules_to_break_up_broadband/dkon8t4/</a></p>

<p>Conspiracy time... Republicans have conned millions of Americas by using Trump to fuel cultural divide and outrage to distract from a massive consolidation of wealth and power for the elite.  Unfortunately most people in this sub have decided that it&#39;s more important to contradict the narrative in the media than those with power. I want to say that one more time. This sub has decided that it&#39;s more important to contradict the narrative in the media than those with power.</p>

<p>I get it. I hate the media too but occasionally you find yourself on the same side as people you dont like. Honestly sometimes this sub feels like a parody of itself they way it spouts government talking points like it&#39;s their job. I would never call people here russian shills even though criticizing this administration will gets me instantly labelled a shareblue shill. </p>

<p>Lastly this sub claims to be so woke about identity politics being used to divide and distracted yet no one ever mentions that Trump intentionally fuels these divides while hes supposed to be uniting and leading our country. This administration has no interest in your privacy, has no interest in getting money out of politics, has no interest prosecuting the criminal elite, has no interest in reforming the justice system, has no interest in transparency, has no interest isolationist foreign policy. It&#39;s time to wake up, the Republican party and this administration are the enemy. Stop giving them a free pass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly can&#39;t answer that question. Partisanship is so far off my radar at this point that I really pay no mind to it.  Until we can all distinguish that parties are yet another divisive tactic we are doomed to fall into the same gaps. End game is the same regardless of what they claim to be. Basically I feel like if your still looking at pol parties as teams, your doing so by design. They even have fun mascots!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad youre so enlightened but my point is that the rest of this sub clearly is not. This sub clearly only plays attention to Democratic wrong doing while the corruption of the Republican party is almost universally ignored. How obsessed is this sub with the Weinstein scandal? How much attention did this sub pay to O&#39;Rilley, Rodger Ailes, Dennis Hastert? How obsessed with the false flag narrative are they with the Vegas shooter when there is no  real political motive. That never seems to happen when the shooter is brown or Muslim even though that&#39;s exactly the kind of false flag a government like this would want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think the majority of people who voted for Trump were voting against Clinton of course, but were also voting against the GOP, the establishment GOP didn&#39;t want Trump in office any more than the DNC. Given limited options, they opted to give the finger to both.</p>

<p>How that pans out we&#39;ll see, but I think a lot of Trump voters were behind him as a person, not the GOP at large. This was a sole populist victory for trump, and a vote against the power structure. The DNC and the GOP are two sides of the same coin. Voters saw a situation where a Clinton might run against a Bush again and were horrified. They went with the dark horse candidate.</p>

He&#39;s might as well be Bush except little less religious but a little more racist.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah US foreign policy has been complicated and a unmitigated disaster recently. Clinton had no choice but to defend it. When Trump talked about past policy he talked with the ability of hind sight which is obviously that we should have been more isolationist. Whenever Trump talked about the future it was in terms of surprise attacks with boots on the ground and bombing innocent civilians. People had selective hearing. It was fun to think Trump was fighting globalist super villains while also indulging in american military fantasies. </p>

<p>Now I dont think they have a choice. They had to pump the DEEP-STATE angle when the Russia angle heated up. Remember before they were all about the FBI and intelligence committees when it was Hillary being investigated. Now no one has credibility but Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a UK outsider I loath Trump&#39;s racism and divisive language. He has a responsibility to ensure their is peace among all sections of society. </p>

<p>Am I right in thinking that he has relaxed guns laws, especially in regards to people with mental health issues? Is this true? Because if so, that&#39;s bloody mad.</p>

<p>However, I do think he has a certain appeal in terms that he is very funny to watch and could do some pretty wonderful things. He more than anyone has an opportunity to open the lid on what really goes on behind closed doors. </p>

<p>Comments like the Israeli leadership are a real hindrance to peace in the middle east is refreshing. I also would like him to open the door on big time theories like aliens and extreme business interests.</p>

<p>I also think his foreign policy is quite good in regards to N.Korea. It is almost like he is speaking their language and using it to tell them to back down. Who knows if this could open a more positive dialogue further down the line. Kim Jong Il just wants to stay in power and wouldn&#39;t risk a military strike on any terms. Its all noise.</p>

<p>If he doesn&#39;t open the lid and continues to propergate racism. He shouldn&#39;t get another term.</p>

You may be an outsider to US policy and politics, so you may not realize that this is very damaging to the US foreign policy objectives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine, here:</p>

<p>If “not engaging in a war” is what you think the bar for success is then you definitely don’t have a full understanding of US objectives in foreign policy.</p>

<p>I’m not being manipulated when I can see for myself what you apparently can not - that it is detrimental to the US foreign policy objectives when the POTUS engages in a Twitter war with an easily agitated leader. </p>

<p>I know you’re an outsider to the US politics, but over here we take the presidents level of discourse seriously. When the president does this nonsense it is considered beneath the dignity of the office of the presidency, which is one of the reasons why a lot of people (not just the media) hate these constant twitter battle distractions. </p>

Please stop being so dumb and just don&#39;t answer. </p>

<p>Throwing insults is just as ignorant. 
And your argument that they are ignorant is based on the facts you gave them with the article which directly contradicted what you are saying.

Instead of being rude and call other people lazy, you could actually do some research on what you are preaching. </p>

<p>Trump said there was voter fraud, which has been debunked numerous times. 
For someone who is running his mouth on fake news he sure does like to spread them. Thats his trick. He tricks gullible idiots to believe his lies.

That is inherently false. What the fuck kind of thought-process do you have to think that? Hahah what!?</p>

<p>My uncle has had brain surgery, didnt pay a single dollar. 
My brother crushed his knee, didnt pay a dollar for over 10 operations.

Firstly; the video is from 2006. The text is mostly wrong, partly right. 
Did you notice the «traumatized countries» part? THAT is the reason we teach them how to act properly! You literally proved my point which you said was stupid, so Thank you. 
Secondly; one isolated incident you find proof of, is not proof that everyone does this, even you should figure this out. </p>

<p>Thirdly: i never said i knew more about your country than you did. Again with the strawman. Stop it, Its childish. 
Let me put it this way. 
America has NEVER BEFORE been so heavily in the worlds eye. NEVER. All because of Trump, and all the shit he pulls. As i said earlier, i am only voicing MY OPINION. Every platform, be that YouTube, Snapchat and Reddit shows news upon news upon news about what is going on with america at the moment. I have an opinion. 
You dont know anything about Norway, and probably have only heard the name 2 times before this conversation. 
Is it really comparable when you say you know more about my country than me? Please enlighten me more on a country you dont know anything about
I never tried to pull out bullshit made up facts to you, which you did to me. </p>

<p>Fourth; i am a norwegian with ancestry all the way back to the viking age and one famous Earl. I couldnt be more norwegian. </p>

<p>Fifth; You do know we are famous for not spending a single cent of our oil reserve right? Even if, and thats a big if, the oil runs out, we can check how our money is doing <a href="https://www.nbim.no/no/">right here, in real time</a> 
Thats 1 trillion dollars by the way. </p>

<p>Trumps values is not that he puts america first. That is only partly true. He puts his rich friends first, and the rest of america second, and doesnt give a shit about the rest of the world. 
He believes in <a href="https://www.google.no/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-us-canada-38753000">torture</a> which even people who have used it says doesnt work. Doesnt matter, his opinion is the only one that matters, just like you.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my theory, and I am probably being biased because I consider myself a conservative and align with many republican views. Nonetheless, I think the last administration, especially when they were in power for two presidential terms, gets a lot of the conspiracy flack because they were the ones conspiring. Therefore, the current conspiracy theories point to the democrats. If you asked 8 years ago, it was the Republicans that couldn&#39;t get a break. That said, the bias also tends to focus on certain topics as well. Democrats are usually the ones blamed for education and welfare and chemical substance based conspiracies because they tend to focus more on those programs as a matter of policy. The Republicans are generally the topic of military, financial, and prison based conspiracies, much for the same reason. I saw a chart at some point in the last couple of years that showed conspiracy bias over time via Google trends, but I forget the exact context, and it seemed to support my view of trends aligning with the recent administration&#39;s political party. I hope at least part of my answer is helpful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the Republicans have hijacked the highest levels of the Democratic party over the past few decades, so there is only a fictitious differentiation between the two parties as far as actual policy that is passed.</p>

<p>If you are still looking at American politics in terms of Left vs. Right instead of Rich vs. Poor, then you are missing the big picture entirely.</p>

<p>Are Republicans getting a pass?  Are Democrats getting a pass?  The answer doesn&#39;t matter because crony capitalists and the wealthy have always gotten a pass throughout all of history.</p>

<p>Are you upset that your political party appears to be losing the public relations battle at the moment?  Perhaps it&#39;s time to work together so that we can all be on the winning team.</p>

No mention if our current president and the sexual harassment claims against him. And when they talk about the &quot;Washington Elites&quot; and pedophila almost always bring up Podesta and the &quot;Dems&quot; but somehow no republicans involved or even aware of a pedophile ring. Thats one reason to be very cautious when Pizza Gate narratives and the like that oust one side and never mention the other players. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disclaimer: We should not dismiss others&#39; opinions based on their political, religious, racial or sexual attributes. We should examine every new opinion based on the merit of that opinion.</p>

<p>Has anyone else noticed that the right wing, pretty much worldwide, think almost exclusively in fear? </p>

<p>Dissect their valued issues. Do they have  these issues, because of compassion for others or because of fear of others?</p>

<p>Please, do the mental work yourself in order to see it for yourself, so that you need not trust anyone else to know it for yourself. </p>

<p><strong>Fear</strong> is the kind killer. It shuts down positive emotions, complex thought and it makes us vulnerable to manipulation. It works as it should. Fear has to do this to function. For when you are faced with a threat to yourself or those you love, you must react quickly and effectively, fighting or fleeing or there may be no more of those positive emotions. This reallocates blood to muscles from digestive organs and also from complex thinking parts of the brain to faster, simpler parts of the mind. That&#39;s exactly the way evolution should go. Proficient manipulators do not ignore the utility of successful exploitation of this system.</p>

<p>They create deceptive constructs of belief and sell them to others in order to get others to serve their own interests in some way. Frequently, it&#39;s to get more money, by influencing policy, by influencing elections, by influencing the electorate, by selling their poison to every day people. Although, con artist employ the same practice to generate stupid, irrational decisions that serve them at the expense of others.</p>

<p>The dichotomy of fear vs love is misleading. We need both in balance to able to properly react to our ever changing environments. When threatened, we should protect ourselves. When we aren&#39;t, we should release the stress, feel good and think with more complexity. In politics, spirituality and other mindful endeavors, we should strive to abandon fear and instead analyze the reasons for the fear. Logic can serve us, to help us cut through fear and find sensible solutions.</p>

<p>So, while the left polarizes toward compassion for others, it neglects to fear moochers and frauds. It is just a tendency of vulnerability toward the fault. Many leftists do a count for moochers and fraud. The right goes to the other extreme. It fears threats often ignoring compassion. Many right wing people do have compassion, but less so in the policies they prefer. </p>

<p>Balance is best for us all, but we are encouraged to polarize to accommodate the corruptors of our reality that want to make us crazy and own us. They prefer we favor fear because it&#39;s easier to control us with fear than love. Love, through stockholm syndrome, through submission to abusers, through forgiveness for intransigent abusers, can also control us. Our enemy dies not want us to balance protection and growth modes of being, which we call fear and love respectively. We need to honor both in all areas of life to defeat them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am guessing you are a serial sexual assaulter since some fox news reporters have been accused of it?</p>

<p>That is how dumb you sound. 
You are literally dragging arguments out of thin air and attributing them to me because i refute your claims. </p>

<p>You just proved you are impossible to converse with.
You just added to the stereotype of Trump supporters. Jeez</p>

Far from it actually. 
Canada is not the first country in the world with free healthcare. 
USA is the last though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you must be really proud. That is why you can&#39;t even say it because you know I will rip it to shreds more then likely. Free health care always leads to the rich getting treatment and everyone dieing off. But anyway have fun saying your country&#39;s name loud and proud there bud I can tell you are so progressive for your people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I.. i struggle to comprehend how you are able to drag all of this shit out of your ass.
How am i a freeloader exactly?
Again with the strawman why are you attributing these things to me i have never said?
Actually Norway has this thing which your country should totally try, it is called INTEGRATION, so our citizens actually leave behind the toxic mindset which does not belong here. Wait, i got your answer ready for you «THEYRE LYING TO YOU!!!!» no they’re not. Its an extensive thing. </p>

<p>Why should i want universal income when every norwegian is secured over 1 million dollars?</p>

<p>So you are actually proud to be able to say you waste your hard earned money when i can save it and use that for buying a house or car or you name it?
You are actually PROUD to say you are wasting money?</p>

<p>Just let me know, are you an accurate representation of the average American? Are all of you really this dumb?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So are we, but how we do it like this. 
Show them how our countries rules and norms differentiate from theirs, and if they cant understand that, we send them back. It has been a hugely successfully implemented idea. </p>

<p>How you do it. 
Ban EVERYONE! «USA is superior, you are inferior! There is no helping you, goodbye»</p>

<p>And the Sweden horde..? 
More inaccuracies or what are you even trying to imply here?</p>
