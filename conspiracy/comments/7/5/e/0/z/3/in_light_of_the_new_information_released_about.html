        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s the theory: </p>

<p>Paddock was running some guns to ISIS, as he had on many, many occasions (which was the source of his wealth, and which explains why he was such a degenerate gambler - he needed to launder all that money). This deal however goes bad as the ISIS guys (there are two of them) figure out he is working with the FBI to trace the guns and ID the buyers (which is why he had set up all those cameras). So they executed Paddock.</p>

<p>The ISIS guys then go about transporting the weapons to their vehicle(s), but there are an awful lot of them, so it will take many trips. They can&#39;t find the hotel room&#39;s key card, so they prop the door open with the security lock flipped out. ( Example of what I&#39;m talking about: <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/Hardware-Express-Security-Door-Lock-807007-L6490-K%7EHDEX1134.html?refid=MX79508438974806-BPA49-HDEX1134&amp;amp;device=c&amp;amp;ptid=4583108062324410">https://www.wayfair.com/Hardware-Express-Security-Door-Lock-807007-L6490-K~HDEX1134.html?refid=MX79508438974806-BPA49-HDEX1134&amp;amp;device=c&amp;amp;ptid=4583108062324410</a> ) This eventually triggered the open door alarm.</p>

<p>The security guard responds to the alarm and stumbles upon the ISIS guys. They shoot him in the leg so he can&#39;t run away. He is told that if he calls for assistance on his radio, he will be killed, so he sits there quietly. </p>

<p>The ISIS guys figure that they are definitely going to get busted now (because they assumed the security guard was there due to someone reporting the gun shot that killed Paddock), so they say &quot;fuck it&quot; and shoot out two windows (there were two of them, which is why two windows were shot out) and open fire on the crowd below. This would explain why so many witnesses reported hearing two shooters/two different guns going off.</p>

<p>The ISIS guys are shocked that after gunning down hundreds of people for 11 minutes straight that they still haven&#39;t been busted, and they suddenly realize they may actually be able to get away with this, so they take off and do, in fact, manage to get away (but they obviously aren&#39;t able to take the remaining guns with them). The security guard didn&#39;t call anyone after the ISIS guys fled because they told him they&#39;d be right back and they&#39;d kill him if he moved or made a sound. Terrified and wounded, the security guard complies, even though an hour goes by before SWAT comes.</p>

<p>The Las Vegas police mostly figured out what was going on within a day or two, but the FBI is on the scene right away and demands that the local cops keep the findings of the investigation under wraps until they can figure out a somewhat plausible timeline of events that doesn&#39;t expose the FBI&#39;s hand in all this. They lied about the security guard&#39;s experience because they obviously had to, since he is the only surviving witness of who really did the shooting. Their lie made him out to be somewhat of a hero because that way he would more readily agree to go along with it. Now that some time has passed and the public&#39;s attention is focused on other things, the feds are allowing little bits of narrative-altering info to slowly drip out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would be the point in keeping the guard alive though? I feel like ISIS would have no qualms about just killing both and letting them assume they killed each other.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my only thought. But that&#39;s really for everything I&#39;ve read. How is he still alive, period? Or not more injured?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point, of course. Maybe the guard was able to convincingly lie to them by saying he was a fellow Muslim, and they believed him because he&#39;s dark skinned (he&#39;s Hispanic)? Seems like a stretch. </p>

<p>Maybe they wanted a surviving witness to be able to tell everyone it was ISIS who did it so the terror group could claim credit? Seems a little far-fetched, too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In sticking with your theory. Could these guys also be responsible for the alleged other shootings at the other casinos? (Namely thinking of that dude who did the Facebook video about being at the Tropicana and hearing gunfire after there was a dude with a mysterious suitcase and later saw muzzle flashes coming from NYNY &amp; Excalibur?) 
There was also a video a woman posted from the Bellagio as it was on lockdown after shots were fired on the casino floor (there HAS to be security footage). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The open door alarm was NOT triggered by Paddock&#39;s door, and Paddock&#39;s door was NOT ajar when Campos or the other officers arrived on the 32nd floor. The open door alarm was triggered by an open door down the hall from Paddock&#39;s, to a room Paddock did not have access to. </p>

<p>This was clarified twice last week by Undersheriff McMahill, and restated again today by Sheriff Lombardo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, at Wednesday evening&#39;s press conference (at the 29-minute mark of <a href="https://youtu.be/tjrD7O79LDo">this video</a>), the sheriff says the security guard &quot;happened upon that doorway because it was ajar, which keyed his interest.&quot; </p>

<p>Next day, the undersheriff gives an interview saying the security guard went up to the 32nd floor specifically in response to an open door alarm (to a room that wasn&#39;t Paddock&#39;s). The Sheriff restated this part today, but of course the rest of the story completely changed.</p>

<p>I think the FBI, Mandalay Bay and Jesus Campos have all been feeding the LVMPD bad intel this whole time. </p>

<p>So a guest kept the door open to trigger the alarm? Probably, </p>

<p>An open door <strong>a few rooms away</strong> from the Las Vegas suite of the man who was gunning down concertgoers at a music festival <strong>set off an alarm that prompted a response from a security guard</strong>, Clark County Undersheriff Kevin C. McMahill said Friday.</p>

<p>The <strong>alarm from a room &quot;a number of doors down&quot; from Paddock&#39;s likely was a coincidence</strong>, McMahill told CNN&#39;s &quot;The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.&quot; <strong>The door was not forced open, had been open for a while, and Paddock didn&#39;t have the keys to that room</strong>. McMahill said that door either had been left open or didn&#39;t shut completely.</p>

<p>as for high-profile location - paddock gets the hotel rooms for free, it&#39;s not suspicious because he&#39;s there all the time, and hotel rooms are private, but also in a very public area. </p>

<p>if you have isis guys coming over to your house, that&#39;s suspicious to the neighbors. if you meet in the middle of the desert and anyone happens to see you out there, that&#39;s highly suspicious. but a couple of foreign guys walking into a hotel/casino in a major international tourist destination isn&#39;t suspicious at all. </p>

<p>The problem is, Trump fired Comey because he wouldn&#39;t promise to be loyal to Trump.  Now Trump&#39;s got his own guy in charge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theory:</p>

<p>Paddock was a criminal asset used by the FBI and CIA at times. He went rogue when he couldn&#39;t sleep and started drinking a lot and taking Valium. </p>

<p>He sold out to ISIS-Philippines. His girlfriend Marilou is his handler. He murdered Trump Country fans in revenge for ISIS being decimated in Philippines.</p>

<p>And Geary Danley has not been forgotten. That guy is sketch AF!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Arms deals would not go on in a high security casino hotel.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re right about Paddock being a pilot smuggler/mercenary/criminal who sometimes worked for government. </p>

<p>You&#39;re also right about him laundering his criminally gained money. But the rest of his wealth comes form his slum-lord apartments.</p>

<p>I think he was going crazy. An alcoholic who couldn&#39;t sleep. He was taking Valium it was getting so bad.</p>

<p>I think he sold his services to ISIS and had the help of at least 5 to 6 other people because of police scanner reports of shooting at other hotels, the fireworks distraction, the woman warning people at the concert, the multiple caliber firing at the same time. This can not be refuted or erased. This is a fact. Stephen was not acting alone. No way.</p>

<p>I think that this was for Isis-Inspired Philippines of which his girlfriend Marilou is one. One of the attackers of NYC venues was also from Philippines. The President of that country just thanked Trump for eradicating ISIS there. </p>

<p>So a guest kept the door open to trigger the alarm? Probably, </p>

<p>An open door <strong>a few rooms away</strong> from the Las Vegas suite of the man who was gunning down concertgoers at a music festival <strong>set off an alarm that prompted a response from a security guard</strong>, Clark County Undersheriff Kevin C. McMahill said Friday.</p>

<p>The <strong>alarm from a room &quot;a number of doors down&quot; from Paddock&#39;s likely was a coincidence</strong>, McMahill told CNN&#39;s &quot;The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.&quot; <strong>The door was not forced open, had been open for a while, and Paddock didn&#39;t have the keys to that room</strong>. McMahill said that door either had been left open or didn&#39;t shut completely.</p>
