    <div class="md"><p>Just trying to save people time from reading it all. Isn&#39;t the philosophy of most people posting here to not trust what three letter agencies say, but when the ATF denies what&#39;s said in the article you are going to believe them?  Like I said before, I don&#39;t believe he had jammers, he was a sweatpants, loafer wearing video gambler... Trust me, I am not intentionally trying to spread anything.  I said he supposedly used these things and then posted a source yet you are still on my ass about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think she has to know something. She can&#39;t seem to keep her shit straight either. She has not been cleared by police BTW and neither has his egotistical pos brother. That guy irritates the hell out of me...I&#39;m really hoping Paddock was his meal ticket and that now he will have to work at Taco Bell. So much bullshit has been said but it was said he used her comps for the first room he had. It really honestly could be that this guy slowly lost his mind and that&#39;s that. We won&#39;t ever see what happened in the halls of the floor he was on. At best we will come footage of him in the lobby or somewhere doing what most people in those hotels do. I&#39;m really sorry about your cousin. I have a friend that works at Sunrise Hospital...he works ICU. He was getting off work that night as victims were in the er. He said he left through the er to be nosey and there was just blood people everywhere. The people who say this was fake piss me off bad. People are really focused on dumb shit. For example, how he got the guns to his room </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah his brother really is a piece of work. He can’t finish a sentence or thought in any of his interviews. And if he works at Taco Bell I’ll be pissed! Love that place haha. Yeah the shooting was without a doubt real, anyone that denies it is a jackass.  I can’t even imagine being in the ER during that. No level of training can prepare people for that and no level of therapy can clear their mind of what they saw and heard.  I agree, there’s no facts a week out and the truth is, I don’t think we will get them. Years from now a few people will bring it up but all in all it’s going to get swept under the rug by the next thing, just like most of the US is already moving on to Hollywood sex rings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, this a THEORY not fact. Second, they say he used a jammer to take out cameras on the floor. There are no cameras on the room floors. Third, blood runs underneath the casings. Try an experiment yourself with water and a butter knife maybe...set knife on floor and pour the water as seen in the photo...the water will flow under the knife. The blood soak under the casings. This article is a theory... Not facts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what u mean. But please when u post something like that...esp an article such as this one...make it known it is a theory. There are so many people here stating their ideas as fact. People then repeat that all over the sub and before u know it...everyone believes it is a fact. It is hard to keep up with that now sadly. Off topic tho...what do you think about Sandy Hook?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a problem, I will clean it up from here on out.  The first thing I remember on Sandy Hook was watching the initial reports and aerial footage of someone taking off into the woods.  Then never hearing about it again.  I think Sandy Hook was the big bang of the gun grab scenario.  Pull on the heartstrings of all those on the fence with a bunch of &quot;dead&quot; kids.  It was hard to watch it all with kids of my own but nonetheless its irrefutable that it was set up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree on both fronts. I feel like Vegas Police are just fed enough to know what to answer on camera.  Old blinks Magee the crazy eyed fed always standing behind him.  It’s disturbing how much they’re withholding but it could be in part due to the fact that there were thousands of people at the concert and on the streets with cell phone cameras.  They don’t know what could surface as “proof” so they’re holding their cards close (no pun intended). Sandy Hook had a tighter knit group of people that were easy to get on the same page (or else). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The man accused of carrying out last week’s deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas, Stephen Paddock, was a caring person who tried his best to &quot;make people happy,&quot; a friend and longtime employee of his told ABC News’ “Good Morning America” today.</p>

<p>“He actually cared about everybody,” said Lisa Crawford of Dallas, who managed an apartment that Paddock owned from 2006 to 2012.</p>

<p>“He tried to make people happy. He tried to make people care. And I don’t know what happened to him,” she said as she fought to hold back tears.</p>

<p>She said Paddock, 64, who apparently killed himself after the massacre, was a close friend, describing him as a humorous person who was generous with his tenants.</p>

<p>She said she found it hard to believe that Paddock, an accountant, could be capable of carrying out the Oct. 1 shooting on the Las Vegas Strip</p>
