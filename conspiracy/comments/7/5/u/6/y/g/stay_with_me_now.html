        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I promise I&#39;m going somewhere with this, but I&#39;m on mobile. I&#39;m going to try to summerize, but I&#39;ll expand more when I&#39;m on my computer later.</p>

<p>Do you remember hearing about Stanley Kubrick helping fake the moon landings? &quot;Proved&quot; to be &quot;false.&quot; But there have been numerous fake events and False Flags since then. Did they get better at this? Were they using people with attention to detail like producers and directors differently? How much has this really been happening? </p>

<p>Which leads me to my next point. With Harvey Weinstein pulling a Polanski and being burried under his own mountain of shit, and other Hollywood Executive more than likely trying to cover their tracks, is that why Vegas went so sideways? It stands to reason that the alphabet soup that is our agencies (FBI, CIA, etc.) Have a good eye and attention to detail. It also stands to reason that Hollywood has a way to make it look believable. I guess what I&#39;m asking is; is it possible that the &quot;False Flag&quot; that was Las Vegas, was executed so poorly because of a lack of Hollywood help? Also, to support the rift between Hollywood and the government, how many have spoken out in support of the government in the last 12 months? </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hollywood would be able to place certain people in certain points and make it look believable to the rest of us who weren&#39;t there. There&#39;s reports of multiple shooters backed by evidence, yet the investigators are still unsure. They&#39;re flying solo. A movie prodcer would come up with a plausible scenario. The director can make it happen similar to the &quot;rumors&quot; about Kubrick helping fake the moon landing. I&#39;m not saying Las Vegas was fake. I&#39;m saying the information and narrative thats being pushed is fake. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so hard to follow, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s ever changing. They don&#39;t have someone with the mind tho do that helping. </p>

<p>None of this is proven, I know that. I&#39;m not dense. It was a thought that I had concerning all the recent headlines that have been popping up with concerning Las Vegas and Weinstein. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t exactly fake a narrative to fit a mold when there were thousands of people there to witness and now millions through YouTube and camera footage. The Hollywood crap didn&#39;t with Weinstein didn&#39;t hit until after shooting. And let&#39;s be real for a second...if they needed someone from Hollywood as you say...then u can bet yr ass they would have it. You don&#39;t tell the FBI no. That isn&#39;t an option. Not to be rude or mean but it doesn&#39;t make any sense. You can&#39;t stage things after they happen..it is too late then with all the witnesses around. You use actors and directors to create a show/movie not a real life mass shooting where people died. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tropicana was right by the venue so it makes sense they would look there to make sure it was secure. Keep in mind...they didn&#39;t know how many shooters either at first.

<p>The helicopter one could be from any day. I will look into it.</p>

<p>What I like about this theory is that it&#39;s outlandish but not entirely unbelievable, unlike most of the garbage that shows up in this sub. I&#39;m not saying I believe it, and I don&#39;t have the time or energy to run with it myself. But this is meaty as hell and, if I had to make a prediction, has the chance to become a cornerstone conspiracy, much like the Kubrick stuff. lol. Good stuff, man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tropicana was right by the venue so it makes sense they would look there to make sure it was secure. Keep in mind...they didn&#39;t know how many shooters either at first. That video doesn&#39;t prove there was a second shooter at all. All that proves is that Tropicana was checked.</p>

<p>The helicopter one could be from any day. I will look into it.</p>

<p>Neither of these prove there was a second shooter tho. </p>
