        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The other day I posted asking about the fuel tanks and how they seem to indicate that whoever shot was an amateur that acted alone.  Here is the text of that post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;During the attack, a second window was busted open to allow shots to be fired at nearby airplane fuel tanks. <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/las-vegas-strip-shooter-targeted-aviation-fuel-tanks-source-says/">https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/las-vegas-strip-shooter-targeted-aviation-fuel-tanks-source-says/</a></p>

<p>These, of course, did not explode...but it is reasonable to think that an average man of that age would believe they might have. After all, countless movies and television shows during Paddock&#39;s lifetime would have conditioned him to believe that the tanks should explode when shot. The only alternative explanation I can think of is that this is an extremely sophisticated misdirection, but I doubt this because everything else about shooting the tanks makes Paddock look LESS like a solo amateur. A second window implies more than one shooter and the longer shot implies more expertise. The overall effect to the average voter is to weaken the mainstream narrative, rather than strengthening it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite being in serious conflict with every conspiracy theory I have seen about this shooting, the post did not attract much attention.  However, a few rebuttals were presented as an explanation for the shooter&#39;s behavior.</p>

<p><strong>1) The fuel tanks were not the target, they were hit accidentally as the shooter missed a different target.</strong></p>

<p>The shooter busted out two windows.  One overlooking the venue where all victims were shot and another overlooking a parking area with the fuel tanks in the distance.  Photo evidence shows that the window overlooking the parking lot and fuel tanks was busted out first.  The most popular conspiracy timeline I have seen (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/juaMQSU.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/juaMQSU.jpg</a>) indicates sniper-like shots being fired out of this window prior to the shooter firing on the concert venue.  It was NOT busted out during the attack as the parking lot became more saturated with targets.</p>

<p>If the shooter was not attempting to shoot the fuel tanks, what was the target?</p>

<p><strong>2) The shooter was aiming at people that had escaped the venue and were in the parking lot.</strong></p>

<p>If the shooter was using the window to aim at people in the parking lot, these shots would qualify as being unusually far off the mark.  When shooting down into a parking lot only a few hundred feet away, there has to be a significant malfunction to angle up so far that you hit a target two thousand feet away...especially more than once.  On top of that, he was using a tripod, severely reducing the chance of this sort of malfunction.</p>

<p><strong>3) The shooter was attempting to hit his van full of explosives, thereby igniting the fuel tanks.</strong></p>

<p>The van was not parked anywhere near the fuel tanks.  It is possible that the shooter had part of the plan fall through and that the van was <em>supposed</em> to be there...but why did he still take the shot without it?  Was there a different van that looked similar?</p>

<p>Regardless, if this was pre-planned by multiple people, especially a sophisticated organization, surely the shooter would have been aware that it was pointless to shoot the fuel tanks themselves should the van fall through...especially if these careful shots risked exposing his position before there was a chance to fire on the concert venue.  Regardless, so far we haven&#39;t heard anything about a van near the tanks being shot at all.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>All evidence I am aware of indicates that the shooter sniped at the fuel tanks a few times before giving up and moving on to the crowd at the concert venue.  These, to me at least, are clearly the actions of an amateur working alone.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists: what is your explanation for this?  Am I missing something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) only 2 bullets apparently hit the tanks</p>

<p>2) you can&#39;t blow up aircraft fuel with a gun, it requires to be mixed with a huge amount of oxygen.  its basically kerosene and even if you light it will a match it will only burn on top like oil</p>

<p>All this leads much more towards the &quot;it was a couple of stray bullets/ricochet&quot; theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He wouldn&#39;t need a second window. The fuel tanks are clearly in view of both windows. This is all speculation, his van wasn&#39;t there, there aren&#39;t an abundant amount of dead people in the parking lot. Why are you just accepting that the fuel tank was shot, from a &quot;knowledgeable source&quot;. They have no source and that article was false speculation, that&#39;s why there haven&#39;t been any follow ups. It&#39;s not real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the shooter could hit the tanks and the venue from room 134. This still from a video immediately after the shooting shows only the rm 134 window broken. </p>
