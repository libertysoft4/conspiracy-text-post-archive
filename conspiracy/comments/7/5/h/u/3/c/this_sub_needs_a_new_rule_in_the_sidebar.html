I see far too many posts that belong in r/politics or r/news or some other sub besides r/conspiracy. I also see too many posts that have a complete lack of context and or are complete shitposts.     </p>

<p>The definitions of conspiracy and conspiracy theory are as follows....       </p>

<p>conspiracy
n.  An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act.
n.  A group of conspirators.
n.  Law An agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime or accomplish a legal purpose through illegal action.        </p>

<p>conspiracy theory
n.  A theory seeking to explain a disputed case or matter as a plot by a secret group or alliance rather than an individual or isolated act.       </p>

<p>This sub has 17 mods, but I continue to see shitpost after shitpost and posts that simply DO NOT BELONG HERE. I don&#39;t know about the rest of you, but for me, It&#39;s really frustrating to see this sub so far off course.       </p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is that r/conspiracy posts should have something to do with conspiracy and or conspiracy theory. If people want to discuss the politics involved in a conspiracy, that is more than fine for the comments section.

<p>There&#39;s a downvote button, use it.  I&#39;ve been arguing against moderation for years, this is one of that last subs that operates closely to r/reddit.com and I don&#39;t want more rules.  It&#39;s how they are able to censor stories in all major subs.</p>

<p>To a certain degree, yes.  There are very few, if any, examples of rules being implemented on a sub that didn&#39;t have a negative impact.  I wouldn&#39;t have a problem if they didn&#39;t can r/reddit.com, but now this is one of the few subs that doesn&#39;t censor topics based off of specific guidelines/rules.  You can block users who you think are spamming, you can hide posts, you can downvote them, but I don&#39;t want censorship from the mods in this sub in any form.         </p>

<p>Because I don&#39;t like censorship and have seen the rules over and over again used for that exact purpose.  I&#39;ve watched well-intentioned rules get out of hand over the years to the point you have mods in r/politics saying you can&#39;t discuss civil liberties in a politics sub...  Literally, they said civil liberties aren&#39;t considered politics.  </p>

<p>Also, the fact you said I shouldn&#39;t be allowed to post articles as data points is fucking nuts to me.  I&#39;ve been here since the beginning, doing the same shit, and now you&#39;re coming and telling me my posts should be removed.  Do you know how fucked up that sounds to me, because you can&#39;t handle some spam here or there.  </p>

<p>Why do you need me to spell out a conspiracy for you?  If you can&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on, then ask, otherwise you are more than capable of downvoting or hiding any post.

<p>Why should it have a clear connection to a specific conspiracy?  If a museam got robbed, we don&#39;t know who did it, but clearly there was a conspiracy by who ever did it.  You don&#39;t think that information should be discussed, even if there isn&#39;t a clear conspiracy?</p>

<p>Honestly, I would rather read that post than one more post that has absolutely nothing to do with a conspiracy or conspiracy theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the OP. But if someone is going to post something which appears strictly political (or any other subject) on a conspiracy sub, then they should provide some commentary behind the conspiracy connection and justification for posting it.</p>

<p>Another pet peeve of mine here is about low effort, no context shitposts (which usually get spammed). You think it’s important enough to post, then it should be important enough to provide your thoughts around. </p>

<p>You want to clean up this sub, force people to give their thoughts about the post. The lazy fucking spammers will go away.</p>

<p>Why do you need me to spell out a conspiracy for you?  If you can&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on, then ask, otherwise you are more than capable of downvoting or hiding any post.  The fact you don&#39;t think people should be allowed to discuss topics or data that can be related to various conspiracies is kind of shocking, and yes authoritarian.    </p>
