<p>*you knowing of your sister&#39;s friend&#39;s lawn care guy&#39;s girlfriend who died isn&#39;t proof or evidence </p>

<p>Edit. So as I assumed, there is zero undeniable evidence proving one shooter, two shooters, 25 shooters, zero shooters. So I ask you to consider this narrative :</p>

<p>The same people who faked sandy hook and Boston bombing faked this event using their standard operating procedures.  Nobody died in sandy hook. Nobody died in Boston.  Nobody died in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>This is the most likely scenario given the available evidence and given my knowledge and understanding of previous hoax events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scene looked real to me. People doing CPR, bodies laying motionless. People transporting the dead on metal barricades. Genuine panic and tears around the dead and wounded.  </p>

<p>That seemed real to me. I would actually be less appalled if it were all actors and that people didn&#39;t actually die. But I don&#39;t think that is the case. There were a few crisis actors on the news after. And I think the story of how it happened Is a story. But people did die, just like 9/11.</p>

<p>Sandy hook, Boston marathon... that was entirely scripted victims, and no one died, and the wounded were already amputees. And you will notice Bauman , or whatever his name is has a motion picture coming out about his heroism of being a marathon victim. Try not to puke.</p>

You are sitting there believing that somehow people made countless videos of people running from gun shots before this all happened lol.

    <div class="md"><p>And if I am wrong, I obviously feel horrible for implying that these victims were participating in a giant hoax.  I don&#39;t believe anyone died, which means I don&#39;t believe the parents of the fake victims when they say their loved one was murdered.  I don&#39;t ask questions in order to make the families of possible victims feel worse...Would it though? And why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So 22,000 people were in on it? They hired that many actors to produce a fake shooting? Those were some damn good actors, everyone should win an award for the portrayal of fear. And Jason Aldean, he was aware the “shooting” would take place sometime right? If not actors, then they paid them all off to say it was real? Not buying it. Come on man. Using your logic, where’s your proof? We all have seen countless videos on the side of it being real, where is yours that it’s fake?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting. I had seen this one already, and I still think the man filming is in on it. As are all of the &#39;wounded&#39; in video, I believe.

    <div class="md"><p>That does appear to be someone falling to the ground after being shot.   I don&#39;t believe that that man was actually shot, but it is evidence I had not seen yet.
