        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I live in a half WT half Mayberry kind of tiny town where nothing ever happens. Woke up at 5 AM to the sound of FBI bashing down my neighbor&#39;s door. My street was jammed with about 20 military and law enforcement vehicles ranging from armored humvees to black box trucks. Military with guns drawn swarming everywhere and uniformed and plainclothes FBI agents. They were searching the interior, perimeter, roof and cars of the house.</p>

<p>The family that live in the house are super perfect looking Christians, with religious and anti abortion billboards in their yard. The patriarch owns some local businesses and kinda seems like the important man about town.</p>

<p>I am a busybody apparently and I&#39;m so curious what they&#39;re searching for. Anyone know where I can figure it out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, do not do that. Doxxing yourself is still doxxing, and possibly subject to a ban.</p>

<p>Regarding your post, I don&#39;t think there is a resource to help you. Probably a secret grand jury indictment. And the FBI doesn&#39;t move until the case is basically watertight.</p>

<p>You might try getting ahold of yurt local FBI field office. Tell them where you live, and ask them what happened. Tell them you have converns about your personal safety and ask if they can tell you what it was all about.</p>

<p>But honestly if they were apparently &quot;good Christians&quot; and the FBI kicked in the door, I suspect child pornography. Not because there is anything wrong with Christians, but because those sick fucks often use religion as a masquerade to make their hobby less believable.</p>

<p>They&#39;re the last family in town I&#39;d ever expect this to happen to. They seem perfect I always feel kinda guilty seeing them, but they do run a preschool so maybe the pornography, and I think they run a drug rehab also. </p>

<p>It was likely law enforcement wearing Multi-cam fatigues, which is very common these days.</p>

<p>Assuming there&#39;s an ongoing investigation, you&#39;re not going to get a solid reason. The best you could do is merely get confirmation of the event. Check the local news. Could be anything from DEA conducting a drug bust to a false report of a shooting. SWAT will respond to a lot of active shooter reports.</p>

This happened to someone I know that was doing some funny business related to the financing of their car dealership.  The FBI rolls in pretty hard even if they are just there to get a few laptops and files. They make a huge scene.  Also their investigations can take years. You may not find out the details for a long time.</p>
