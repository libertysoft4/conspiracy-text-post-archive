<p>Take whatever comes out of it with a grain of salt at the least. They could be pulling some gatekeeper/false information release type bullshit. I don&#39;t know...Ya never know with these fucking people I swear. </p>

<p>But why would a guy, the very guy we are trying to pursue criminally right now as a potential child rapist, want to suddenly &quot;awaken the masses&quot; and pose as some kind leaker or whistleblower? </p>

<p>He&#39;s in the elite! They know all the secrets! They have dirt on his ass and if he spoke out they could end him in a second. I don&#39;t think this guys all of a sudden some fucking pedophile turned good turned freedom fighter. He&#39;s a fucking rat who will do whatever it takes to stay alive and obey his masters orders. </p>

<p>EDIT: ....but...</p>

<p>also entertain the possibility that they are using him as some sort of a gatekeeper or shill. given his reputation, they may be using him in another way. Remain skeptical of anything. </p>

<p>AND this could all just be some goofy distraction they thought up as well. we don&#39;t want to embarrass ourselves. The Vegas shit seems to be a big priority we should keep one eye on. </p>

<p>this network of pedophilia stretches far beyond what we can imagine . Even our own president should be looked into regarding his connections with Jeff Epstein</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think the members of the elite already know all the secrets of the world being kept from us</p>

<p>Definitely not all of them. Even within the upper echelons, there is consolidation and compartmentalization of knowledge. I wouldn&#39;t be surprise it, when all was said and done, only about 50-100 people actually knew the <em>full</em> plan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you making it seem as if he&#39;s some kind of &quot;truth seeker&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not, I&#39;m just stating what he seemed to be hoping for in the emails, I&#39;m not defending nor attempting to rehabilitate Pedosta. I was a Bernie voter, I was there when DNC leaks happened, I was in r/wikileaks with the Podesta releases, I was there, and I agree with you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>trying to suddenly leak information to the very people pursuing him criminally ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s not. In another thread on this topic, I said that if anything like this is coming from John&#39;s mouth, it&#39;s bad news, and that it would more likely be the start of Bluebeam than real disclosure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it all started when she was 14...</p>

<p>&quot;Although the couple met when Priscilla was only 14 at a party at the singer&#39;s home in Germany, Elvis was reportedly immediately reduced to an &quot;awkward, embarrassed&quot; demeanor in her presence. Despite the decade age difference between the two, the couple&#39;s courtship lasted almost eight years, and their eventual marriage lasted another six and a half years. Elvis later explained their divorce by saying that you &quot;can&#39;t teach a person to be affectionate.&quot;</p>

<p>If TPTB did not want to give up information on ETs, and they had an ?asset? who was expressing an interest in releasing that info, would they intentionally target that ?asset? and make them the focus of a rumor?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just asking if there is anyway we missed the true intent of PG.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are many different groups that make up TPTB, some of them want ET disclosure, some don&#39;t, some want full disclosure, others want partial disclosure that still allows them to manipulate everyone and maintain power. Podesta is part of that group.</p>

<p>The article in the huffington post was interesting because it said that they got the tech for their new spacecraft from UFOs. SO it seems like the intention is to actually disclose the existence of ETs, but maybe I am missing something because I&#39;m sure it would be a bigger deal if that&#39;s what they&#39;re actually saying?</p>

<p>Self-serving behavior even at the expense of others is source of all evil. To choose to be evil is to choose to be a parasite on others. Parasites basically seek imbalanced value exchanges relationships with others. They use deception and coercion, because they have to overcome free will to get those relationships.</p>

<p>Humans can be parasites, so can bacteria, multicellular organisms, viruses, fungi, and extraterrestrials. They are called negative ETs, but I think parasite is a better model for understanding. It takes mystery away and replaces it with eye rolling repetitive emergent patterns. All of these self-serving machines think very similarly. They are manipulative. </p>

<p>Apparently they&#39;re announcing information about UAP (unexplained aerial phenomena/UFOs) later today. It&#39;s weird, because it seems to me to be enromously huge news if a load of people in government or who have worked high up in the military are coming together to make an announcement about the existence of UFOs and how their technology means there is the potential for all kinds of space travel etc. Yet there is hardly any mention of it anywhere, even this sub is weirdly quiet about it. I know Podesta being involved discredits it, but still, there are other people besides him involved, and if they are really going to tell the public that UFOs are real, surely that is huge? Unless I am missing something?</p>

Sadly, today&#39;s crazy leftists and susceptible right-wingers have been engineered by the globalists, and they will likely be the first to bend the knee and specially chosen by them to carry society  forward should something like this occur. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the biggest conspiracy you don’t want to hear yet it’s the truth.  What you call “Christianity” is not what you think it is.  The Roman Catholic Church led by the Vatican is the exact opposite of Christianity.  True Christians know the King James Bible is the word of God and know how to rightly divide it to covenant and time period.  We do not fight against flesh and blood but against spiritual wickedness.  Therefore things like crusades, blowing up abortion clinics and nonsense like that is not Christian.  That is the Vatican which is Satanic in nature.  That’s why all the pedophilia and such comes out of there.  They are Luciferians at the top just like all the secret societies like the Masons.</p>

<p>That said, the big conspiracy is that Jesus is real, he really is God, he really did die for your sins, and he really is going to come back in two stages.  First the catching away of the Church.  This is what the false conspiracy of Project Blue Beam is for.  When Jesus comes to catch away the church before Jacob’s trouble this conspiracy will be there to allow you to explain it away.  You will also have many people professing Christianity but were never actually saved telling everyone that it was not the rapture.  Nobody will want to believe it when it happens and this conspiracy will be ramped up at that point in order to cause confusion and obscure the reality.  The time of Jacob’s trouble (post rapture) will be supernatural in nature.  Think of shows like Game of Thrones where magic was dead for a very long time, so long that people forgot it existed.  In reality it’s God that’s existed and we have forgotten about him.  When these supernatural events happen that are prophesied about in the book of Revelation people will be deceived into thinking it’s some kind of alien invasion.  You will then find yourself looking at a guy who is so powerful, so amazing, so charismatic and he will seem to be a savior.  He will unite all nations to fight the threat and defeat it.  He will even seem to be killed, loose an eye and come back to life then proclaim himself to be god.  This is the Antichrist.  A few years after this Jesus Christ will return and actually set foot on earth again and take his vengeance.  The Jesus Christ taught in most churches today who loves everyone is false.  He has wrath for those who reject him.  The Elites are sacrificing children to Lucifer because he gives them power here.  They are deceiving the entire world trying to take as many souls to the lake of fire as they can.  Get saved by the grace of Jesus Christ while you can!  Once they unleash the false Alien deception it will be very hard to see through it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No contradictions my friend.  Jesus was talking to Jews mostly about the physical Kingdom of Heaven (physical Kingdom here on Earth) which is still in the future.  He talked a lot about Jacob&#39;s trouble (the coming time of mass Chaos when the NWO destroys it&#39;s &quot;dark side&quot; with it&#39;s own  false &quot;light side&quot; but remains in full control) but it all was directed at physical Jews.  We are in the Church dispensation (spiritual Jews which anyone can become by faith in Jesus Christ and his Gospel) which is the Paul line of Epistles.</p>

<p>2 Timothy 2:15 (KJV)
Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>

<p>Rightly dividing is understanding covenant and context.  The Bible is full of these and trying to mash them all together is what has caused so many cults and false forms of Christianity to spring up all throughout time.</p>

<p>Just keep it in the back of your mind as a consideration.  A short 7 months ago I would have agreed with you but since I&#39;ve had way too many supernatural things happen to me that prove to me the Holy Spirit is at work.  Unfortunately there is no way to &quot;prove&quot; this to anyone else, each individual has to discover it for themselves.  Good luck to you as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got saved this spring and had no idea about bible versions or any of that.  I fully believe it was the Holy Spirit that led me to the King James version.  I had an ESV for a while and couldn&#39;t bring myself to even read it but when I got a KJV in my hands it was like the spiritual floodgates opened.  There is a lot of false history being thrown around.  I&#39;m not even sure King James was a Mason.  It&#39;s disputed and the Elite have been in control for so long they can easily re-write history.  King James also wrote three books exposing Demonology and other Occult things so it&#39;s clear he was very much against it.</p>

<p>Since I&#39;ve been led to the KJV I use it as the filter I test everything with.  So for the YHWY issue I go with the KJV&#39;s translation of JEHOVAH.  I&#39;m no Jehovah&#39;s witness but they got the name right I think.  In the end I don&#39;t think this issue is anything to get hung up about.  Jesus Christ is God and his name is perfectly fine to use.  He is our high priest and the only mediator between us and God the Father.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for us to fully understand the Godhead and that&#39;s why it&#39;s a great mystery but Jesus Christ and God the Father are one and therefore Jesus Christ is God.  I believe we are all made of Body, Soul, and Spirit.  The way I think of it is Jesus Christ is the Body (what we humans can relate to), JEHOVAH is the Soul, and the Holy Spirit is the spirit.</p>

<p>So since our fallen fleshy human vessels cant really comprehend God he sent us Jesus Christ his only begotten son, the Word of God made flesh who:</p>

<p>Col 2:9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</p>

<p>So Jesus Christ is God and I don&#39;t see any reason to get hung up on how to pronounce those four consonants but if I&#39;m asked I go with the KJV over any man&#39;s opinion.</p>

<p>I would say give the KJV a read for yourself.  It&#39;s worth your time.  You will see it is very much the exact opposite of a system of control.  That&#39;s why the world is so against it.</p>

<p>Again, I have read all the Abrahamic texts from old to new. You are aware the original definition of YHWY was Tetragrammaton](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton</a>)</p>

<p>There is a lot more going on than what you currently understand. Again, if you don&#39;t take a step back and read the texts that predate Abrahamic texts you are never going to formulate a big picture. </p>

<p>How do you rationalize multiple other cultures and texts that predate your religion by hundreds / thousands of years yet tell the same stories? The flood story is retold over and over again. The tower of babel literally comes from ancient Babylon and is retold in a christian perspective. Are you not aware that the first Abrahamic religion that you are based off literally took power as a cult and YHWY was derived from EL one of the many gods from the pantheon of Cannanites etc.</p>

<p>You are really doing yourself a disservice if you refuse to do the research for the basis of your beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I remembered you had said that and edited that out.  Sorry about that.  The flood is mentioned everywhere because it actually happened.  I don&#39;t believe the Gnostic texts pre-date the God of Abraham and what he was doing in the book of Genesis.  I agree it all goes back to Babylon.  That is where almost all of the current false religions, cults, and the Occult come from.  They had their languages mixed up and started using symbols to communicate.  They still use them today.  Now that there is another mostly universal language (English) we are progressing with the Occult agenda at a breakneck speed.  Babylon never really went away which is why it&#39;s still mentioned in Revelation.  It believe it to be all the secret societies from Masons to Jesuits and all the rest that are involved with Babylonian occult stuff of various sorts which encompass the &quot;mystery schools&quot; (Mystery Babylon).</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time trying to research things and what I found were just tons of rabbit holes and many are created by the very Elite/Occult we are trying to free ourselves from.  I basically gave up but had seen enough to know that the Occult was doing rituals and they were having an effect.  I was convinced Satan was real and therefore God so I simply gave up and called on him for the first time in my life and he responded.  That&#39;s the only way I can describe it.  From then on I gave up on myself and put all my trust with him to lead me to all truth.  I believe the KJV is the only truth we can have in our hands.  We can&#39;t trust history, we can trust the education system.  History was written by the Occult.  We can only put our trust in God.  Even today sometimes I find myself trying to rationalize something to figure it out.  I get all messed up but when I simply give up and ask God to guide me and provide an answer he does.  If you believe your research has proven to you that Jesus Christ didn&#39;t exist or is a psyop (which is very much what the Occult want you to think) then that will be a major stumbling block since believing in your heart his Gospel is a key part in that relationship.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You are aware the original definition of YHWY was Tetragrammaton
 So for the YHWY issue I go with the KJV&#39;s translation of JEHOVAH.
Jehovah is just another translation from older texts into KJV. So El--&gt;YHWY--&gt;Jehovah and all the like...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are educated in Babylon mythology you should see why this is a serious problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The flood is mentioned everywhere because it actually happened.
I agree. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the gnostic texts are hard to pin an exact date we do know Gnosticism was the dominate theology of the Alexandrians etc which correlated directly to the burning of the Library of Alexandria. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was convinced Satan was real and therefore God</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is all explained in via Ancient Babylon and translated / altered many times until it eventually ended up in current dogma. I don&#39;t think choosing sides in an ancient power struggle of advanced beings is beneficial for humanity. See my previous comment ----&gt;he tower of babel literally comes from ancient Babylon and is retold in a christian perspective. Are you not aware that the first Abrahamic religion that you are based off literally took power as a cult and YHWY was derived from EL one of the many gods from the pantheon of Cannanites etc.</p>

<p>I do think there is something to Jesus just based on the pure hatred for him in Judaism and the Talmud; I am not convinced he lived during the time they say he did. There is certainly a correlation to astrology and the sun. Occult mystery schools often consider people to be literal stars or celestial beings, at least it can be attained theoretically.</p>

<p>Curious, how do you rationalize the contradictions of Jesus and the other apostles? Do you think it is morally justifiable to condemn homosexuality? I know Jesus does not literally say this but lays it out almost in terms of moral decline.</p>

<p>John 8:39-47New King James Version (NKJV)
31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him
39 They answered and said to Him, “Abraham is our father.”</p>

<p>Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham. 40 But now you seek to kill Me, a Man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this. 41 You do the deeds of your father.”</p>

<p>Then they said to Him, “We were not born of fornication; we have one Father—God.”</p>

<p>42 Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me. 43 Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word. 44 You are of your father the devil</p>

<p>So right here we have Jesus basically calling the foundation of Christianity &quot;the father of the devil&quot; since Christianity is a direct descendant of Jewish/Abrahamic theology . </p>

<p>4 You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do</p>

<p>You don&#39;t find it odd that Jesus calls the jews the father of the devil? I thought this was the basis for Abrahamic religions / Christianity?</p>

<p>Do you believe the bible when it talks about the Firmament / sheol?</p>

<p>Why do you think YHWY or as I like to call him yaldabaoth talks in the plural throughout genesis? Please do not just say &quot;The holy trinity&quot; I really dislike that answer immensely. It shows a lack of critical thinking.</p>

<p>Did you ever notice YHWY only talks to Cain and not Able? You ever contemplate the reason for that?</p>

<p>Whats about the giants and other stories of &quot;Angels&quot; mating with human females and creating offspring?</p>

<p>Please take some time to answer these. I appreciate your humble replies and have enjoyed our conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As you say, King James really didn&#39;t have much to do with it other than providing a place for the translation to be done and allowing his resources to be used.  This was after William Tyndale prayed that the King of England would have his eyes opened while being burned at the stake.  Tyndale&#39;s prayer was answered.</p>

<p>Yes the Millennial Kingdom will be a one world government.  It will be a benevolent dictatorship in the form of a Kingdom who&#39;s King is perfectly holy, cannot lie, and is without sin.</p>
