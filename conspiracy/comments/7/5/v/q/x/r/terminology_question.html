<p>The answer is the three C&#39;s: Coercion, Compartmentalization, and complicity.  In other words, they&#39;re either part of it, forced into doing it, or are unaware of their role in the crime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I refuse that. I shouldn&#39;t have been made to feel what I did.</p>

<p>Sayin/Typing that &#39;out loud&#39; makes me feel, very retarded... but I still mean it. Its not fair. I&#39;m not a fucking &#39;snowflake&#39; type at all, but no one should feel this way. No one should question their sanity or wonder if they need to get evaluated and then realize that they were taught their whole. fucking. life. to believe in the system. </p>

<p>That is the only fucking reason I feel ok. I HAD to answer XYZ to pass a grade. I had to do that over and over. Fuck. The only logical people right now are the ones who don&#39;t have college degrees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. First, I understand the tendency to call people bots or shills. I&#39;m beyond fed up and there is no .. online place to go to. Everywhere is infested. Paranoia is at a high. </p>

<p>However, I also understand your point if you&#39;re being frustrated at being a bot since you don&#39;t even have a weiner to self-service.</p>
