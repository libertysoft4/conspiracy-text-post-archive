<p>Trump is the kind of guy who likes to be the best at everything. He is getting to the end of his life and has acheived the highest position that he can. What if he is planning on redpilling the world in order to become one of the greatest people in history. The president that brought down the largest conspiracy in history. He would be remembered forever.</p>

A fresh comet straight out of the Oort cloud is the scenario you are imagining, realistically. They don&#39;t light up until their first pass of the Sun. We could be in the cross-hairs of a civilization-ending giant right now and not know it.

<p>Is Trump not a billionaire? That would be the same as turning $1,000,000 loan into $1,000,000,000(1,000 million) </p>

<p>I digress, Trump actually made multiple billions, and I did a low ball comparison for the sake of easy numbers.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>hahaha, browsing <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/brain/mensa-offers-to-host-an-iq-test-with-tillerson-and-trump/">IFLS?</a></p>

<p>Here is the problem, Trump is a lot smarter than you, the media, and his opponents perceive him to be. That has been the downfall for opponents since this he started. Do not under estimate the intelligence of your President. You&#39;ll be made a fool. </p>

<p>You may not realize this, but Trump is legitimately the best manipulator of the media the world has ever seen. Disagree? Who comes close?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume here, but you may want to do less talking and more listening, more critical thinking, and more understanding of those who hold different views from you. Honestly, this is not a dig.  </p>

<p>Where did I imply he is smarter than everyone? All I did was say he is smarter than you perceive him to be. You obviously think he is a buffoon, while you over no supporting evidence. Only a buffoon would agree with you based on your well thought out arguments.</p>

<p>Yeah, idk, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be writing the history books. He would probably go down in history as a real estate mogul who built a multiple billion $$ empire, sky scrapers across the country, who employed 1000s upon 1000s of people, and who, against all odds, won the presidency. The 1st person in American history to win the Presidency with no political experience. </p>

<p>I wonder how wonderful a legacy will be for someone named Crumpledforeskin calling the president a buffoon. Please tell me you see the irony in this. </p>

<p>4 or 5 bankruptcies out of 100s of companies is actually quite astonishing. What makes him a bad businessman again? </p>

<p>You literally have no objectionable observation. I could point out Trumps flaws, no one is perfect. You, however, cannot make a coherent argument without throwing insults. A simple minded mud-slinger. </p>

<p>I am basing it off of your lack of understanding, comprehending, conversing without insults with people of whom you disagree with.

<p>Not really, we are not even a year in lol. On top of that, their is a balance of power. The president is not a dictator as much as you would love to have one as long as they agree with your political ideology. The president cannot sign anything unless it is passed by congress. A corrupt republican controlled congress that can&#39;t agree the sky is blue unless their donors say so. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He will leave office with his pockets lined and crumbling country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His pockets are already filled, and the country has been crumbling for the last 30+yrs. I don&#39;t know if you realized that, yet. There are 2 ways to control a nation. 1 is by the sword, and the other is with debt. We are $20trl in debt with no logical way to pay it back in a generation. We have created a multi-generational economic slavery system. You, I, your kids, my kids, our friends are all economic slaves.  The dollar will collapse. It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when.&quot; The ship has been taking on water for years and Trump comes along to give people a bucket, and hope to save the ship. </p>

<p>Trump is giving business&#39;s the opportunity to grow with deregulation. Are you familiar with his 2 to 1 EO? Well, it&#39;s actually closer to <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-kills-16-regulations-for-every-new-one-crushing-2-for-1-goal/article/2629177">16 to 1</a> &quot;In the last five months of fiscal year 2016, the Obama administration imposed $6.8 billion in annualized costs from economically significant rules. By contrast, the Trump administration has imposed less than $0 in regulatory costs during its first five months.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, if jobs are so great, why are most of them minimum wage/part time at the same time the welfare state continues to grow forcing people to be more and more dependent on big brother?</p>

<p>We are 20Tril in debt. Obama doubled the debt. Obama doubled the money ever borrower of all presidents combined. What do we have to show being 20tril in debt. Serious question. What?

<p>He <em>was</em> a constitutional lawyer who took a shit on the constitution. DACA was an EO. Brazenly unconstitutional. He openly tried to override immigration laws on the books with an EO. Trump is an evil racist for following the laws already on the books. Trump is evil for wanting congress to put a DACA bill on his desk. You know, following the actual process to make a law.

<p>I don&#39;t need to defend any ones actions but my own. I&#39;m not on trial, and I&#39;m not a lawyer. Can Trump be wrong? Sure. Can Trump be right? Sure.

<p>During a 2009 visit to Pyongyang to seek the release of two detained American journalists, former U.S. President Bill Clinton raised the issue of abducted Japanese nationals with then-leader Kim Jong Il, a hacked document released by the secret-spilling site WikiLeaks has shown.</p>

<p>The memo, attached to an email sent to John Podesta, a former Clinton White House chief of staff who joined the ex-president on his mission, is part of a trove of emails released by WikiLeaks.</p>

<p>Podesta, head of the liberal Center for American Progress think tank at the time, now serves as the campaign chair for Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s White House bid. WikiLeaks has been publishing emails since Oct. 7 from Podesta’s account,** which experts say was targeted by Russian hackers.**</p>
