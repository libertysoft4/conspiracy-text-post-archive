        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This interview was conducted on October 25, 2001.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/hrUXZfM.png">https://i.imgur.com/hrUXZfM.png</a></p>

<p>Here is how McCormick describes what he saw:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wasn&#39;t six feet away from the guard, when I cought a glimpse of the back end of the plane coming in. There was an explosion, smoke and fire, and instantly everyone was on the radio yelling that we&#39;d been bombed and to evacuate the building out of corridor 2.  I started running across the lot to the heliport side, and it got chaotic quickly.  Everyone was trying to empty out of the building and the parking lot, screaming, and as I ran down through the building, I heard a second plane coming in right over top of the lot.  I was hollering to people not to come out of corridor 2, there was another incoming aircraft.  To this day no one has explained to me to my satisfaction what that was.  Someone said it was a jump jet to ward off the plane, but the only thing that could do that would be an F-16. That second plane turned, laid over, and came through between 2 and 3, right up through the smoke where the other one had crashed into the building.  It went through the smoke and out of here to who-knows-where. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/AorzJkE.png">https://i.imgur.com/AorzJkE.png</a></p>

<p>Later on in the interview he McCormick clarifies what he saw:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, I didn&#39;t see the plane fully, flying in. I heard it more than anything, the engines thrusting up, and when I looked I saw the back end of it coming down. I assume he was coming in at an angle. When I saw the tail end of the plane, immediately I saw the massive explosion.  It&#39;s just the sound or glimpse that caught my attention and immediately came the explosion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the FBI investigating this, he says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, they talked to me because there had also been another plane coming in. I told them I didn&#39;t know about the one 20 minutes away, but there was one seconds, away from the building.  That was my statement, and they never said anything since.  I think they all know exactly what that plane was and what happened to it, but they are not going to come and tell me.  I know it didn&#39;t hit here, so I guess that&#39;s a good thing. I can&#39;t tell where it went or what it was about, but it was a large aircraft. All I could see was the belly, that&#39;s how low it was, coming across South Parking.  After I saw one hit, it&#39;s wasn&#39;t a real good feeling to see another one coming in.  I thought, man, what&#39;s going on?&quot; </p>

<p>As an addendum, McCormick is not the only eyewitness that claims there were two planes. </p>

<p>This is NEIT 428.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The building started shaking and things started falling, so we ran out.</p>

<p>When we ran out,I mean, it was just something like a missile. You know, it just went into the Pentagon. And we was on the side where we could see where the plane went it. </p>

<p>But I was thinking it was a missile. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/4kiDpY9.png">https://i.imgur.com/4kiDpY9.png</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And we, all we could see was the smoke and the heat. We could feel the heat. And it was so intense that after that happened, we looked up in the sky and there was another plane. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/qa3dafy.png">https://i.imgur.com/qa3dafy.png</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plane was so low we were thinking it was going to do the same thing, but the plane made a turn and went in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>It was low enough that it could touch the building, the warehouse. It was close.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;d probably say about telephone pole height. Because I was really thinking it was  a separate plane coming in. To this day I don&#39;t know, because nobody never said anything about that plane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fighters that were sent for AA77 came from Langley, and were 150 miles away from Washington at the time of the crash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>t 09:35, Colin Scoggins from the FAA&#39;s Boston Center again called NEADS to inform them that they had located an aircraft, which later turned out to be Flight 77, heading toward Washington D.C. at a high speed. Two minutes later, a NEADS radar technician spotted a target he believed to be Flight 77. This radar target was in fact Flight 77, but the target vanished as soon as it was discovered.[2][4] NEADS officials urgently ordered the fighters from Langley to be sent to Washington immediately, but the plane struck the Pentagon at 09:37:46. The Langley fighters were still 150 miles away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You claim that someone saw a second plane behind the craft that crashed into the Pentagon. </p>

<p>Not recalling the exact details, but remembering that there was a fighter jet response at some point that day, I pointed out that maybe it was a fighter escort. </p>

<p>You reply linking a Wikipedia article giving details about how radar did not show the fighter craft was in the vicinity at the time of the Pentagon attack. I then thanked you for that info.</p>

<p>The fact is, there was radar data. The fact is, the official story does not have any second craft following the first craft. They apparently did not have any radar evidence of a second craft. </p>

<p>Then you blame me for not providing radar data. Since this topic is your interest, I think you should research this and try to find the radar data to prove the second craft, or that such radar data was covered up. In any case, I ask you to respect that this will be my last post on the matter.  </p>

<p>This is the only thing I object to, as you have no actual data to support this point.   During the investigation, no one was asked to provide bulk radar data, what was asked of Dulles was to reconstruct the flight path for AA77, which was done by military and private contractors, by an office that is not certified in analyzing radar data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was an Air National Guard C-130.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77#Hijacking">&gt;&quot;An airplane was detected again by Dulles controllers on radar screens as it approached Washington, turning and descending rapidly. Controllers initially thought this was a military fighter, due to its high speed and maneuvering.[35] Reagan Airport controllers asked a passing Air National Guard Lockheed C-130 Hercules to identify and follow the aircraft. The pilot, Lt. Col. Steven O&#39;Brien, told them it was a Boeing 757 or 767, and its silver fuselage meant that it was probably an American Airlines jet. He had difficulty picking out the airplane in the &quot;East Coast haze&quot;, but then saw a &quot;huge&quot; fireball, and initially assumed it had hit the ground. Approaching the Pentagon, he saw the impact site on the building&#39;s west side and reported to Reagan control, &quot;Looks like that aircraft crashed into the Pentagon, sir.&quot;[22][36]&quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there are 2 reports of a plane being at &quot;telephone pole height&quot;.  Are there any more?  If there was a plane flying that low hundreds of people evacuating should have seen it, and certainly the witnesses that actually saw the first plane would have seen it.  And why didn&#39;t Gopher 06 report another plane?  Did anyone report seeing Gopher 06 (C-130 @ ~2000-3000 ft)  because we know that he circled the Pentagon around 1 minute after flight 77 hit.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more likely that they saw Gopher 06 and are mistaken about the altitude he was flying at.</p>

<p>Very few people actually claimed to have seen the crash. Many reported the plane heading towards the pentagon and seeing the explosion.  That is why reports of a second plane flying up are so interesting.  Concerning the number of people who claimed a second plane was flying.  So far there is this witness captured on video. </p>

<p><a href="https://vid.me/MK0ak">https://vid.me/MK0ak</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And why didn&#39;t Gopher 06 report another plane?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want my honest opinion, it is because the actions of this plane are highly suspicious.  First point is that it was the same plane that confirmed UA93 as crashing in the official story, but read the actual transcript. He just states there is smoke high up in the clouds.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/VSd6mm6.png">https://i.imgur.com/VSd6mm6.png</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/kyEC2dH.png">https://i.imgur.com/kyEC2dH.png</a></p>

<p>Cleveland center thought that it was a military plane that crashed in Pennsylvania. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/3jcMBYD.png">https://i.imgur.com/3jcMBYD.png</a></p>

<p>But this is the most strange piece of information. It reports gofer 06 stating an aircraft crashed N/E of Camp David, then we are given LONGITUDE and LATITUDE for the crash, with confirmation it was a civilian aircraft.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/OBwZpUS.png">https://i.imgur.com/OBwZpUS.png</a></p>

<p>This plane is at the heart of what really occurred that day. </p>

<p>Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.  As for &quot;confusion&quot;, I was talking about ATC.  Those who witnessed a second plane were not confused.   They saw Gopher 06 circle the Pentagon 1 minute after flight 77 hit it, they are just mistaken about Gopher 06&#39;s altitude.  In the video you linked, the guy even says that the lady who saw the second plane said it was a propeller plane that was following 77 and banked off.  Gopher 06 was a prop plane that was following 77 and banked off.</p>

<p>There was no report that it did not crash from the Cleveland center. That is a piece of information added to the situation in an ad hoc manner. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.</p>

<p>Eyewitness testimony can be unreliable concerning details, not the general events witnessed. The unreliability of eyewitness testimony becomes more reliable as the story gets corroborated. It is why having multiple witnesses claiming the same thing is important. </p>

<p>Moreover during the Goss press conference you can clearly hear an explosion first, and jet sounds literally seconds behind. </p>

<p>There was no report that it did not crash from the Cleveland center. That is a piece of information added to the situation in an ad hoc manner. </p>

<p>Yes.  They (CONR) were confused.  Cleveland Center said Gopher06 crashed, then CONR comes back and says Gopher06 reported the crash of an airliner.</p>

<p>Ok.  Like I said, they did see a plane.  They could easily get details like speed, heading, and altitude wrong.</p>

<p>The video is interesting.  It starts out at the what looks like the intersection of Capitol Circle NE and Capitol Driveway NW, which is about 3 miles from the Pentagon.  No timestamp.  Then it cuts to another location, and I can&#39;t make out where it is, but he is standing beside a building, and it is not the Pentagon.  Maybe the Senate office buildings?  Again, no timestamp on the footage.  Without knowing where he is, and what time the video was taken, it&#39;s hard to say what we are hearing.  If he remained in the general area, he&#39;s right near the path of Reagan International runway 4/22.       It may just be an airliner inbound for 22.</p>

<p>If there was a plane flying that low hundreds of people evacuating should have seen it, and certainly the witnesses that actually saw the first plane would have seen it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very few people actually claimed to have seen the crash. Many reported the plane heading towards the pentagon and seeing the explosion.  That is why reports of a second plane flying up are so interesting.  Concerning the number of people who claimed a second plane was flying.  So far there is this witness captured on video. </p>

<p>And why didn&#39;t Gopher 06 report another plane?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want my honest opinion, it is because the actions of this plane are highly suspicious.  First point is that it was the same plane that confirmed UA93 as crashing in the official story, but read the actual transcript. He just states there is smoke high up in the clouds.</p>

<p>Cleveland center thought that it was a military plane that crashed in Pennsylvania. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/3jcMBYD.png">https://i.imgur.com/3jcMBYD.png</a></p>

<p>But this is the most strange piece of information. It reports gofer 06 stating an aircraft crashed N/E of Camp David, then we are given LONGITUDE and LATITUDE for the crash, with confirmation it was a civilian aircraft.</p>

<p>This plane is at the heart of what really occurred that day. </p>
