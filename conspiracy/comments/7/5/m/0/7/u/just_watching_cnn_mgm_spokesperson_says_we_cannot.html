<p>Now MGM is basically saying LVPD is wrong about the timeline, I also read the first lawsuit against MGM was filled today, so maybe MGM corporate is now calling the shots and on full defence of their security employee...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is it. </p>

<p>I see it as the police had it right, but that would make the casino look bad. Negligence. Stuff like that. So now the MGM is going to try to cover their tracks.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t looked it up yet but who came out and said that the security guard caught him BEFORE the shooting? Originally it was the police who said he reported after the shooting right?</p>

<p>So is the MGM trying to say they caught the shooter sooner, but it took police forever to get there? Or are the cops the ones saying the guard reported the shooter BEFORE it happened, but the MGM did nothing about it?</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested to see how this all plays out.</p>

If anyone is trying to conspire, I think it&#39;s the hotel industry.</p>

<p>They want to have the best image possible. I wouldn&#39;t doubt it if they are the ones trying to cover stuff up or change the narrative. Especially if the shooter had access to service elevators.</p>

<p>Typically 10 days after an event like this we have solid answers from people involved. So far all we have heard is from high ranking officials. None of the direct parties have shared except for victims whose videos and stories are getting filtered out as they vary from what the official report states. </p>

Unfortunate that the unreported gas leak just happened to explode at that moment.  Unfortunately, due to the extent of the injuries, the identification cannot be 100% positive.  It remains unclear how he was able to trip over his shoelaces while being wrapped in a duffle bag, authorities are investigating.</p>
