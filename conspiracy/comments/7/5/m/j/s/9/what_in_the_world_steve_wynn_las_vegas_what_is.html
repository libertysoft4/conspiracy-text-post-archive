<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/75emhc/confused_about_what_is_happening_in_the_world/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/75emhc/confused_about_what_is_happening_in_the_world/</a></p>

<p>With recent research I have come to a even more astute conclusion. Hear me out.</p>

<p>TL;DR Version:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Trump is most likely a good guy (most likely a narcissist who wants to be known as one of the greatest presidents of the greatest country or a citizen of the greatest country in the world)</p></li>
<li><p>There is a war/disagreement/conflict between TPTB, cabal, etc all over the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Las Vegas was an attack at Trump&#39;s last base of support</p></li>
<li><p>Harvey Weinstein was the response by Trump&#39;s team</p></li>
<li><p>Trump is most likely just one member selected as the face of a larger group of individuals attempting to undo the political coup that happened so many years ago (General Wesley Clark).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Trump has had his base of support slowly cut down ever since being elected into office. He has also made a series of deals that made some of his supporters question his motives. Trump is no fool, those who work with him are no fools either. They realize the power that wealth gives, the power that money gives, the power of knowledge/intelligence, and the power that influence gives. Members of this group are actively waging a war on the influence front yet the attack on Las Vegas was a gamble due to the current unsteady nature of the upper echelons of our societal structure. One side gambled to lose a bit of influence in order to bolster their own stocks (gun companies and legal reason to manufacture more guns [they don&#39;t actually want to take your guns and know they can&#39;t and it isn&#39;t a logical move]) while the other side would be completely fucked from the attack. Luckily it was not as horrible as it was planned to be.</p>

<p>Watch what Steve Wynn says. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTMePDPgAsU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTMePDPgAsU</a>
They had a profile of the attacker and his girlfriend. They NEVER drank any alcohol. They needed a clear mind. Sure a clear mind for gambling is true but they NEVER touched alcohol at restaurants either? Watch his subtle emotions when the host ask him to clarify if he knows anything about the attacks intent. Lip biting to think and the slight eye flicker to adjust his mentality right before saying the lie and hating the fact he needs to say it.</p>

<p>The attacker was aiming at the crowd and hoping to ignite fuel tanks so the attack would be bigger and worse. Worse as in they were planning to explode the jet fuel tanks. I suspect (open hole in theory) that they failed to ignite the jet fuel tanks as reported. That would have crushed Vegas&#39; economy and completely destroy MGM. I have a hunch that MGM, Wynn, and the old Mafia (the old bootleggers &amp; prohibition era) are supporters of Trump and you can tell there is an inner circle within the strip owners by how Wynn can both speak harshly towards MGM yet also not in a patronizing way but a friendly way. So in other words the attack if it was completely carried out would have destroyed all of Trump&#39;s support in one blow. Their resources (human resources as well trying to recover financial assets!) would have been destroyed. Which leads to why the Weinstein story was leaked. Trump and co probably have a bag of tricks as well to use. At this point I suspect they&#39;re all just waiting for the other to not have any more tricks and release all the gooey details. Political stress from all sides will probably make that a non-option. There is a very real war going on at the top.</p>

<p>Notice how there is that big ass airport?</p>

<p>Check out that subtle banter. I didn&#39;t even get to this part until I posted.</p>

<p>&quot;Steve Wynn. Thank you. Thanks for your time and we&#39;ll be watching for yours and the rest of Las Vega&#39;s response to this tragedy&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ll be fine. We&#39;ll be fine (Smiling). The president did a good job.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><h1>3 is right on the money. What better way to split a fan base than have one of &quot;his own&quot; attack a bunch of &quot;his own&quot;, with &quot;their own weapon&quot;.</h1>

<p>And to have cherry on top, have a latino UNARMED (note how they keep pointing it out) take down the shooter, so they can say &quot;SEE? YOUR OWN are killing their own, and this man, who&#39;s kind you want to deport from this land of ours, was able to save so many just using his training and bravery. Not with a gun, just his big latino heart and love to his fellow brothers and sisters of all creeds and colors!&quot;</p>

<p>But oops...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, no gaslight. You&#39;re not crazy either. Things just arn&#39;t black and white.</p>

<p>See the following.</p>

<p>KING: In &quot;Esquire,&quot; the August issue, you said, &quot;Look at the war in Iraq, the mess we&#39;re in. I never would have handled it that way.&quot;</p>

<p>TRUMP: I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we&#39;ll be getting out. Now I do think we have other problems.</p>

<p>I think you have to do something with the nuclear weapons that are obviously being built in Iran and the nuclear weapons being built in North Korea where they&#39;re -- that&#39;s not even obvious. I mean, they&#39;re saying they&#39;re building nuclear weapons, and we&#39;re bogged down in Iraq.</p>

<p>Now Iraq can solve the problem with Iran because you happen to be right next door, and, all of a sudden, Iraq maybe turns out to be a good transaction, so to speak. The fact is that Iran is building nuclear weapons and North Korea is building nuclear weapons, and that&#39;s the big quinella, and I hope President Bush can do something about that and quickly.</p>

<p>KING: If you were to bet on a place you would never build, it would be the Middle East. If that&#39;s true, do you ever have any hope there? TRUMP: Boy, it&#39;s such hatred, so many years and years and even centuries of hatred, that it just seems inconceivable that they come together.</p>

<p>But I will tell you I watch today the Palestinians and the Israelis and the level of hatred and the level of animosity and all that&#39;s going on, and it&#39;s really, really sad.</p>

<p>I would love President Bush to call me and say, &quot;Go over and negotiate peace between the Palestinians and Israel.&quot; I would love to do that.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one thing that I would probably like doing more than building great towers all over the place because I really believe with the right intermediary, the right mediator, the right negotiator, you could go over and really do a job. I really believe you could get them together.</p>

<p>KING: You are offering your services?</p>

<p>TRUMP: I would do that in a heartbeat. I mean, what&#39;s more important? They&#39;re killing each other. It&#39;s leading to beyond even them. I mean, it&#39;s leading to problems like nobody would believe long beyond them. But if he would ask me to do that, yes, I would do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not Trump supporters but the power players in the world. People who have power, money, assets, and influence to leverage and hedge bets. All the power players were informed some how or another through loose networks where to hedge their bets and many of them chose to gamble instead because they were tired of the bigger sharks telling them what will happen. Perhaps they want to run the town after or maybe they want to liberate it. As peasants we won&#39;t know. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a Trump supporter or Clinton supporter or whatever the fuck. In the grand scheme of things this is how scaled democracy works. People will vote themselves into the coffers or in this case vote themselves into the coffers and then bait the peasants to bring the money from the coffers to their individual estates.</p>

<p>TL;DR. You&#39;re a peasant and hold no power and therefore you do not matter. Your vote is about 1 in 320 million not applying other rules. Money can influence people easily in the short term but harm them in the long term. Things that are green can be called pink if enough people are dumb enough to believe or young enough to have forgotten.</p>

<p>Also... since 2017 Wynn was named finance chairman of the Republican National Committee.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure about the MGM people dumping stock but it would seem if they did at the last minute due to side channel rumors spreading they would be doing it to salvage what they can from others playing the markets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think thefalse flag group isv embedded in the crooked part of theDemocrat party. Look at how these have been more rare, but higher profile, since trump took office. I disagree with trums bending to money and Israel, but at least the bamboozle is less. He isn&#39;t the outsider you think though. The echelon is comprised of tribes and those tribes help each other. Trumps tribe hates Obama Clinton bush tribe and they just took down a big contributer in the opposing tribe.it&#39;s a threat to stop slandering trump or lose money. Notice the media flip so quick. I believe something serious is about to happen with war so they are trying to tighten up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wynn didn&#39;t just hint that a hotel employee had to be involved, he basically flat out said it.  No regular person would have access to the service elevator unless accompanied by an employee.  And this interview took place before the narrative changed to &quot;Paddock had access to the service elevator as a perk.&quot;</p>

<p>Wynn knew from the beginning what happened, or at least has a basic idea.  This is how businesses work.  All the casino owners are probably close friends.  They probably play golf together all the time.  They all had a security meeting after the attack, and they all know what&#39;s up.</p>

<p>Wynn dropped major info as OP said about the complete lack of drinking alcohol by both Paddock and the girlfriend both at Casino and at restaurants.  Is trying to convey that this was not some volatile drunk?  Or is he trying to convey that there&#39;s a certain group of religious extremists that also completely refrain from alcohol?</p>

<p>This was a great line, and it&#39;s an interesting theory and angle imho.</p>

<p>Do we know more about the fuel tanks? Where were they located? How much fuel was in them? How large would the explosion have been?</p>

<p>This is the hole in the theory. If it was professionally done they would have known that these specific gas tanks are protected from these types of events (gun fire). However, this theory does correlate a few things, for example the direction of the right window and two giant jet fuel tanks. The fact that the gun on the bipod was meant to be used as a sniper. Further matching the written numbers on the note to place specific trajectory.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the guy was planning to get out too. Still many holes to the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I think you&#39;re right about there being different groups/factions of TPTB and that this has become much more obvious since Trump gained power. Seems like over the past few years battles behind the scenes weakened the Cabal&#39;s (I think these are the &#39;satanic&#39; cultist elites) grip on power culminating in Trump&#39;s election. And since then it&#39;s been so crazy and the battles are spilling out into the public arena. This disclosure thing Podesta is hinting at is part of that.</p>

<p>They all know that &#39;the truth&#39; is going to come out and they are all vying to be the ones to manipulate that truth as much as possible in their favour. This also has to do with the natural raising of awareness and consciousness in humanity/society as a whole, which is  like a juggernaut that they realise they will not be able to stop no matter how much they fiddle with their algorithms. All they can do is try to control how much of the truth gets out and how much they can direct it to their own ends.</p>

<p>I agree that Trump et al are not some kind of heroic group, I suspect Russia and China are part of that group in some sense, in that they want the overthrow of the Anglo-American hegemony, which has been controlled largely by these satanic cults, using mechanisms such as blackmail to control people whose predilections are abhorrent to the general public (i.e. what pedogate/pizzagate is all about, and why those revelations are coming thick and fast).</p>

<p>Las Vegas was an attack at Trump&#39;s last base of support</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Listen guy, why are you assuming that people at a country music festival in Las Vegas are Trump supporters?  Until last year, Trump was a New York real-estate asshole and reality TV &quot;star&quot;.  In other words, about as relevant to country music as Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of us out here who like country music.  I&#39;d say a good 45% of us at minimum, didn&#39;t vote for Trump, don&#39;t like him, and don&#39;t associate him with our musical choices.  </p>

<p>So stop, please, just fucking stop associating country music with Trump.  Liking one doesn&#39;t necessarily imply we like the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, no gaslight. You&#39;re not crazy either. Things just arn&#39;t black and white.</p>

<p>See the following.</p>

<p>KING: In &quot;Esquire,&quot; the August issue, you said, &quot;Look at the war in Iraq, the mess we&#39;re in. I never would have handled it that way.&quot;</p>

<p>TRUMP: I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we&#39;ll be getting out. Now I do think we have other problems.</p>

<p>I think you have to do something with the nuclear weapons that are obviously being built in Iran and the nuclear weapons being built in North Korea where they&#39;re -- that&#39;s not even obvious. I mean, they&#39;re saying they&#39;re building nuclear weapons, and we&#39;re bogged down in Iraq.</p>

<p>Now Iraq can solve the problem with Iran because you happen to be right next door, and, all of a sudden, Iraq maybe turns out to be a good transaction, so to speak. The fact is that Iran is building nuclear weapons and North Korea is building nuclear weapons, and that&#39;s the big quinella, and I hope President Bush can do something about that and quickly.</p>

<p>KING: If you were to bet on a place you would never build, it would be the Middle East. If that&#39;s true, do you ever have any hope there? TRUMP: Boy, it&#39;s such hatred, so many years and years and even centuries of hatred, that it just seems inconceivable that they come together.</p>

<p>But I will tell you I watch today the Palestinians and the Israelis and the level of hatred and the level of animosity and all that&#39;s going on, and it&#39;s really, really sad.</p>

<p>I would love President Bush to call me and say, &quot;Go over and negotiate peace between the Palestinians and Israel.&quot; I would love to do that.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one thing that I would probably like doing more than building great towers all over the place because I really believe with the right intermediary, the right mediator, the right negotiator, you could go over and really do a job. I really believe you could get them together.</p>

<p>KING: You are offering your services?</p>

<p>TRUMP: I would do that in a heartbeat. I mean, what&#39;s more important? They&#39;re killing each other. It&#39;s leading to beyond even them. I mean, it&#39;s leading to problems like nobody would believe long beyond them. But if he would ask me to do that, yes, I would do that.</p>
