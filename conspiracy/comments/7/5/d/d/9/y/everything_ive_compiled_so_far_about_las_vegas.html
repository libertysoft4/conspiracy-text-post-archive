<p>Las Vegas PD has released this official <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/LVMPD/status/915740011064025088">Timeline</a>
It doesn&#39;t add up. Their narrative is falling apart.</p>

<p>I was able to create a fairly accurate timeline using the following Videos:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpMrm1xUJ40&amp;amp;t=610s">Police Scanner 1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xAcTKNpDeY&amp;amp;t=3855s">Police Scanner 2</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vdeHMqCscs&amp;amp;t=478s">Gunshot Timeline 2</a></p>

<p><strong>The actual time was determined using Gunshot Timeline 1, but the time stamps refer to Gunshot Timeline 2</strong></p>

<p><strong>At this point the Audio from Police Scanner 1 disappears and I use Police Scanner 2. It is 2mins off of the source I was using.</strong></p>

</ul>

<p>I&#39;m not ruling out Hodge having a role in this. To be honest being part of a production team is a good cover. It allows for lots of technical equipment and luggage, and no production is complete without production <strong>VANS.</strong> </p>

<p>My theory is that the gunfire coming from 134 &amp; 135 was done after Paddock&#39;s death (at least some of it) If you look at the leaked <a href="https://goo.gl/images/nGMcXp">PHOTO</a> of his body his blood congealed perfectly around the bullets as if with no resistance. They almost look placed there or were discharged as he laid there, but I don&#39;t see splatter that would indicate a falling shell. Also notice the fresher looking blood on the left on top of older/more dried blood. How is it possible for the blood on the bottom to be more dry than the top and it extend out further than the fresher blood? </p>

<p>It is my opinion that something larger was thwarted, and more targets were in mind at other casinos. Numerous active shooter calls were made from other casinos and each time they were responded to as false..... but
I believe the goal was to draw attention to 134 &amp; 135 and stage it setting up Paddock then move to another location to carry out another part of their attack.  </p>

<p><strong>Edit: I now feel like there were others already in place at the other casinos. The plan was botched and the panic/shooter reports from other casinos were caused by them abandoning their mission trying to leave.</strong></p>

<p>This could just be panic, doesn&#39;t confirm a shooter.</p>

<p>I would like to know who the other members of Hodges&#39;s production team are. He mentions THEY were going to the room before he fled to the bushes. Maybe another member had access and wasn&#39;t accounted for earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>I find it very odd Marilou and Hodges are both Australian citizens and that Paddock was able to check into a room without her or her ID (Its not really hard to find someone similar looking.) </p>

<p>Even more strange is how fast they located Marilou and had her flown back to America WITH NO PRESS COVERAGE OF HER LANDING! NOT ONE PICTURE OF HER GETTING OFF THE PLANE NOT ONE JOURNALIST TRYING TO INTERVIEW HER!!! Edit: <a href="https://imgur.com/uEScOu2">This</a> was found.</p>

<p>AND NOT ONE PICTURE OF COMPOS WITH FAMILY IN THE HOSPITAL AS HE RECOVERS AND ENJOYING THE ACCOLADES OF HIS HEROISM BY ADDRESSING THE COMMUNITY!</p>

<p><strong>JESUS CAMPOS</strong></p>

<p>I believe the elevator was his escape route and had no idea they’d been shut down. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/las-vegas-shooter-how-many-rounds-shots-bullets-hotel-mandalay-bay-2017-10">Original Narrative</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mandalay-bay-security-guard-jesus-campos-distracting-las-vegas-shooter-2017-10">Updated Narrative</a> </p>

<p>LVMPD has made a drastic change to their chain of events </p>

<p>In the original narrative it stated that Jesus responded to hotel guest calls of shots fired, was shot at 200 times, and took a bullet to the leg. Then proceeded to <strong>RADIO</strong> Paddock&#39;s location. In the new narrative he was on the 32nd floor responding to a door alarm and was engaged with Paddock 6 mins before the attack on the concert. I guess in the new story he lost his radio because if he had it and informed LVMPD of Paddock&#39;s location I&#39;m sure a lot of lives would have been saved. </p>

<p>Either way the surveillance Paddock was using was not actually functioning, so how did Paddock know someone was approaching. </p>

<p>The last shots were fired at 10:15pm It is my opinion that Jesus shot Paddock then himself in the leg. He shot through to the hallway to make it look like he was taking fire. Seriously 200 rounds and you’re only hit in the leg?</p>

<p><strong>Edit: Now I&#39;m supposed to believe no one heard 200 round 6 mins before the attack?</strong></p>

<p>MSM can&#39;t stick to their govt fed lone shooter narrative because the attack was botched and they can&#39;t deny/suppress the second sets of gunfire, witness accounts, BS timeline.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the largest Shooting in American history and it&#39;s not even on the front page of google news. They&#39;re trying to bury this disaster as quick as possible.</p>

<p>Where is Campos? </p>

<p>Edit: Cleaned up, added some of the stuff you guys have posted in the comments.</p>

<p>According to them Campos was found at 10:18pm and informed the officers of the location of Paddock.</p>

<p>But on the police scanner officers don&#39;t make it to the 32nd floor until 10:23pm and locate Campos by the elevator until 10:25pm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is what I&#39;ve been arguing since the information came to light.</p>

<p>Apparently campo didn&#39;t have a radio, but I find it extremely odd that a security guard in a hotel/casino in vegas gets shot and knows the floor he is shot on and can find no way to radio down to security. If they found him by the elevator, why would he just take the elevator, or use the elevator phone, or...</p>

<p>And if he was &quot;sent to check&quot; on a situation (open door alarm or whatever), how did he find out about it and why did he go without a radio. Unless he was just patrolling the floors without his radio and came across the open door.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone with security had a radio because the request to shut down elevators was made at 10:17pm. If he had his radio like the story says and he was shot a full 6mins before the attack on the concert wouldn&#39;t police have made it up there either before the shooting began or at least kept the casualties down? </p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t think the first officers that made it to the 32nd floor at 10:23pm are alive. Gunfire ended at 10:15pm. The &quot;strike team&quot; spent an entire hour up there taking care of loose ends.</p>

<p>who made the call to shut down the elevators and how were they aware something was going on? Reports from other guests? Shutting down the elevators was a security measure, but it also locks down guests or forces them to stairwells.</p>

<p>Do you mean paddock would&#39;ve walked out or campos?</p>

<p>This has been my point ever since the pic&#39;s of the doors were leaked. What did he do open the door hip fire 200 rounds? No because if you look at the bottom of the blown door there are 7-10 holes on the bottom left corner.. So that would mean Lee Harvey Patsy(aka Paddock) would have been prone firing.. Why? and if so did the other 190 rounds go through the same holes? Wow what a shot! NOT!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try to find where I found/heard of it. IIRC Swat breached first door 32-135. Cleared (1 swat officer fired a round... was heard and reported on scanner), second breach from 32-135 into 32-134. It is unclear if they ever tried the door to 32-134. I would assume so because they stated they had to clear the rooms all the way up to his.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try and find it and will edit it when I do or someone else can respond with it.</p>

I&#39;ve been also compiling a LOT of data, I&#39;m just not sure how to organize it all. Short of being THAT guy with a large map, newspaper clippings, and strings and marker lines drawn (you know the one), do we have a central spot/thread to compile this all on?</p>

<p>So far, I&#39;ve also been saving posts with substantial info. Maybe we can use a One Mother of Sticky all things LV?</p>

<p>I have some interesting things that haven&#39;t been mentioned here before as well (or maybe have and got lost).
My concern is that whatever we post, will be scrubbed (not like you know who isn&#39;t reading these boards). I&#39;m kind of new to this, to be honest. Not the truth seeking, just ACTUALLY being witness to this kind of fuckery in real life.</p>
