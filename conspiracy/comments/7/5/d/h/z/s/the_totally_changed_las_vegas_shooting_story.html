        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The most insane thing about <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-shooting-20171009-story.html">this</a> is that the FBI and LVPD can come out 8 days after the fact and completely changed the basic facts of their story of the worst mass shooting in the history of the United State while opening up a whole huge set of patently obvious and critical new questions such as:</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t Campos contact the police or at least his hotel security coworkers at 9:59 PM (6 minutes before the mass shooting began) to tell them he had been shot?</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t Campos contact the police or at least his hotel security coworkers at 10:05 PM when he must have heard the hundreds of 160 decibel automatic weapon rounds being unleashed on an innocent crowd?</p>

<p>If he did so at either point, then why wasn&#39;t any of this information reported on any police scanner? </p>

<p>Did the supposed 200 rounds shot at Campos also happen at 9:59 PM?</p>

<p>How could this occur without other hotel residents hearing the shots and calling 911 or at least the Mandalay Bay front desk?</p>

<p>Why weren&#39;t any of the 17 armed Mandalay Bay security guards immediately dispatched to investigate the situation and subdue the guest? You had better believe that they can protect their chips and vaults against far more than one 64 year old shooter with extreme deadly force!</p>

<p>Why was it a complete surprise to the cops when they found an injured Campos on that floor some 18 minutes after he was shot (and just in the nick of time to completely miss all the shooting)?</p>

<p>What didn&#39;t the hotel security cameras catch Paddock drilling expensive hotel property? </p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t other guests report any of this drilling or shooting to the front desk or the police?</p>

<p><strong>But not a single reporter present at the press conference, er, release asked a <em>single</em> one of these questions!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been careful about buying into all the really specific speculation, but I&#39;ve never doubted that there was <em>something</em> not right with the story. There is no good reason that such a critical part of the official narrative would be changed 8 days after the event. And if we are to assume they were deceiving us on purpose, and not simply incompetent, then why would they out themselves like this? Are they dropping bread crumbs for us, or are they now telling the truth because they know a major leak is coming? Trying to safe face perhaps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They seem like legit questions. If there is scanner audio from that night (there is) and it wasn&#39;t reported that there was a known gunman in the hotel (it wasn&#39;t) it stands to reason that nobody called the cops. Why, after hearing a gunshot in your hotel, would you not call the cops, or at the very least, the desk?  If the desk was called and it wasn&#39;t reported to the police, why? If it was reported to the police and they didn&#39;t warn the officers out there that night of an active shooter this close to a major venue, why? If they did report it and got all the information correct, how was it not stopped sooner? </p>

<p>He has good questions, and you&#39;re speaking like you have all the answers (you don&#39;t). If you do, out with it. The entire nation is dying to know. If you don&#39;t have all the answers (you don&#39;t) then leave all lines of questioning open until there are facts to narrow everything down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most likely, that&#39;s what they&#39;re banking on. The gubb&#39;ment uses dumb shit like confusion and discrediting people to its advantage. They hope that it becomes a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; so that when questioned they can say &quot;oh that conspiracy theory?&quot; Being associated with a conspiracy theory is enough for the average person to discount what you&#39;re saying. Is it right? No. Does it happen? All. The. Time. </p>

<p>They&#39;re also (most likely) flooding different media sources with different information so the story is lost and argued about. 
Example: &quot;CNN said he&#39;s a right wing but job who had too easy access to fire arms&quot; 
FOX News said he was a liberal with an agenda and thats why he targeted a country concert.&quot; </p>

<ul>
<li>disclaimer, I just made those up. I don&#39;t think they were reported *</li>
</ul>

<p>They&#39;re playing the biased consumer against the other. It&#39;s an effective way to keep the public bitching at one another and distract the general population while they do shady arms deals with foreign countries, supply weapons to cartels, or use unmarked planes to deliver money to another government. It&#39;s how they stay in power, and that&#39;s the only thing they&#39;re really concerned with. Stop looking to your government for answers. You won&#39;t get them. What you will get is exactly what they think you want to hear. That&#39;s why theirs only 2 major political parties. It gives the illusion of competition and division about certain important issues, but really they&#39;re just jerking each other off to us fighting about &quot;republicunts and libtards.&quot; </p>

<p>/rant... I guess</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah so if the gunshot didn&#39;t affect his mobility there&#39;s literally no logical way that the shooting should&#39;ve even happened in the first place.

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>

<li>Officer checks when he got to the room

    <div class="md"><p>O.k. I will try to answer these questions based on my guesses.</p>

<p>My guess is that the police and FBI are looking for more accomplices and this is why they don&#39;t show the CCTV footage, or the Mandalay maids and security guards aren&#39;t interviewed.</p>

<p>Probably attacks came from multiple hotels such as the Tropicana. Police scanners seem to prove this.</p>

<p>Paddock was part of a mercenary/terrorist team. Just like the attack on Mumbai.</p>

<p>The weapons and ammo were hidden in suitcases and 2 people were in both rooms at all times to make sure the maids didn&#39;t snoop around.</p>

<p>Jesus Campos was sent up to the floor to checkout a fire alarm that one of the guests set off because they couldn&#39;t phone out. Did he have some kind of top secret communications jammer? The guests were alerted because Paddock was trying to seal himself in his room by drilling screws into planks on the door. </p>

<p>Jesus confronts Paddock before Paddock starts firing. The shooter(s) in the other room try to hit the airplane fuel tanks. Paddock fires 200 rounds at Jesus but gets Jesus in the leg. The shooter(s) in the other room escape. Jesus is unable to call for backup because of this jammer. Paddock starts to fire into the crowd. Jesus risks his life after 11 minutes to stop Paddock. Jesus bluffs and tells Paddock that the police have arrived. Paddock does himself in the mouth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Making sense out of the MSM narrative:
Paddock wasn&#39;t fully ready to pull off his plan. He wasn&#39;t even close, actually. He was drilling near the door (perhaps to put in a camera, or reinforce the door, etc). The drill triggered the open door alarm because it caught a wire or sensor, not because the door was open. Guard comes to check on open door alarm. Knocks on door to inform the guest (Paddock) that he was checking on an alarm.
Paddock thinks he&#39;s busted before he&#39;s even fully set up for it. Starts spraying bullets at the uniformed officer outside the door. Unloads 200 bullets through the door?! Or perhaps he hadn&#39;t barricaded himself in yet, and popped his muzzle outside the door and let off 200 rounds.
Then, the next six minutes he spent (barricading himself in and) smashing out the windows, loading his guns, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying to leave it at this, but maybe he had a psychotic episode, snapped out of it, realized how fucked up he was, and decided to kill himself before he hurt any more people. Crazy people aren&#39;t full crazy all of the time. Just like a serial killer doesn&#39;t kill people all day every day. Or go through with their plans everytime. That might explain why he booked a hotel over lalapalooza but never did anything.</p>

<p>The 23 guns were for efficiency. He knew there were a lot of people to kill, and he had a limited amount of time to do it -- he didn&#39;t want to deal with jammed guns. If his gun jammed, just pick up another and continue spraying bullets.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the story about the drilling. That&#39;s cover for why Campos doesn&#39;t just go check the door alarm then leave the floor.

<p>It took 18 minutes for the cops to get to where Campos was. If what hotel security was really supposed to do in such a situation was to guard the chips, why was wounded Campos still on the floor when the cops arrived?</p>

<p>Think this through a bit. </p>

<p>So Campos calls hotel security and that he says he is shot and that he was just shot by some old guy who was drilling hotel property on the 32nd floor. And you are telling me that they told him, &quot;Just keep bleeding there while we don&#39;t tell the cops about you. We all need to guard the chips.&quot; </p>

<p>Minimizing liability is a huge part of &quot;protecting the interests of the casino.&quot; Imagine the liability the casino would face if it sought out and engaged in a gun fight and an employee or guest was hurt. Too risky.</p>

<p>In fact the casinos are so risk adverse that they will avoid whenever possible getting the police involved when crimes occur on their property. To do so creates a public record that could be used in a lawsuit against them. And the police like it this way as they would overwhelmed if they had to investigate even 1% of the crimes occurring at these hotels.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we know for sure what Campos did, if anything, to notify the police or security of what was going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They WILL use their own security in all non life threatening situations and take reports a do investigations. In that sense they are like mini law enforcement jurisdictions. But as a crime victim at a casino you will not learn the full results of the investigation and the police will not be involved by the casino. The purpose of the investigation will not be to make you whole. It will be to minimize casino liability.</p>

<p>And yes, a casino is a great place for petty crooks to cheat, rob and steal. Worst that can happen is you are blacklisted and if that occurs then you will be blacklisted from all major Vegas properties(major casinos cooperate in this regard).</p>

<p>I&#39;m almost tempted to think that he was intending to do this much later. Like he still needed to wire up the rest of his equipment he was drilling for, record his manifesto, drive his car of explosives over to the oil tanks or to another destination (oil won&#39;t explode unless vaporized and generally tanks are pressurized to prevent that from happening for safety- I&#39;m thinking either he knew that, being a pilot, and thought exploding the car would invite an explosion. Or he didn&#39;t know that and his plan was to get everyone running to the tanks, blow the tanks and send them towards another spot where his car was, blow that up and send them to another spot, in the meantime he was fully prepared to be firing the entire time.) If he had the room booked longer perhaps Sunday wasn&#39;t even his initial plan (although I doubt it if doors were screwed shut). </p>

<p>I&#39;m definitely thinking he intended to start later now though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but some asshole sprays 200 rounds into the hallway, the walls would be completely fucked , and rounds would be littered in rooms, right? The two were obviously working together and when campos went to finish off paddock he got shot in the leg. Would also explain why paddock &quot;stopped&quot; an hour before swat entered the room. That&#39;s my belief until these assholes stop lying and start telling the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>makes no sense to fire after bc by the time cops/swat get there, the massacre is over bc Paddock had supposedly killed himself.</p>

<p>q is, was Campos armed or not?  And if he was shot 6 min before the massacre, why??? makes no sense.</p>
