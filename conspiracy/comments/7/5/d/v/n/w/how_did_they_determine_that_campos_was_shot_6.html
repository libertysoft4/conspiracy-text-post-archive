Think about it, how could they have possibly determined he was shot 6 minutes before the shooting started. He didn&#39;t tell cops he was shot until atleast half an hour later. The only way that this could be verified is <strong>FROM CAMPOS HIMSELF</strong>. Think about that, because <strong>why would Campos incriminate and complicate himself and his position in the shooting by saying that to police.</strong> He wouldn&#39;t. I think this entire story is fake, to throw people like us off. This puts a whole different spin on things and has certainly sparked debate already. What do you think? How do they know the 6 minutes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was spotted on the 32nd floor by the maintenance worker</p>

<p>Police officers who started searching the hotel after the shooting began didn’t know a hotel security guard had been shot “until they met him in the hallway after exiting the elevator,” Lombardo said.</p>

<p>Charles &quot;Sid&quot; Heal, a retired Los Angeles County sheriff&#39;s commander and tactical expert, said the new timeline “changes the whole perspective of the shooting.&quot;</p>

<p>Heal said that if police had known immediately that a guard had been shot, they would have rushed the room while the gunman was still firing. He said it seemed to signal a breakdown in communication.</p>

<p>“It doesn&#39;t say much for hotel security,” Heal said.</p>

<p>After Campos was shot, a maintenance worker appeared on the 32nd floor and “Campos prevented him from receiving any injuries,” Lombardo said.</p>

<p>Representatives for the Mandalay Bay hotel casino and the union representing Mandalay Bay’s security guards did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.</p>

<p>It was at most 19 minutes. He claims to have been shot at 9:59 and the official timeline still states that officers encountered him when they arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:18. I think Lombardo said Campos claims to have called for help earlier than that, but there&#39;s no mention of it on the police scanner audio so I&#39;m not buying it. </p>

<p>No clue. Doesn&#39;t really matter though because the Jesus Campos will be telling a brand new story tomorrow. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;ve been told no. I don&#39;t have a specific source to cite ATM though. </p>

<p>The wrinkle here is that the windows may not have been broken until after the shooting stopped. In this case, maybe there are window break sensors, but they didn&#39;t go off because the windows weren&#39;t actually broken at that point. Then they&#39;d have to lie and say there weren&#39;t sensors on the windows in the first place. But then wouldn&#39;t shots fired through the windows trigger the sensors anyway? Idk, it&#39;s all very messy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If so, was there a silent alarm that sent the security guard to check room 135 when a window was broken?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this is what I initially thought too,a but the LVMPD has explicitly stated several times now that the open door alarm was triggered by a door to a room down the hall, which Paddock did not have access to. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the guard was merely checking a door ajar from a few rooms down before anything started, there would be no need to shoot at him.  Just wait for him to leave. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is such a good point. </p>

<p>...Unless he went up to the door to investigate the drilling noise? </p>

<p>...But then shooting him in the leg, leaving him alive, and waiting 6 minutes to start shooting at the crowd outside makes absolutely NO sense. Why not wait for Campos to knock on Paddock&#39;s door to inquire about the drilling noise and then shoot him point blank? Then he could have stolen the guard&#39;s radio and/or phone or whatever to tap into the security feed, and bought himself more time to prep for the shooting. </p>

<p>Honestly the only explanation that makes sense is that he was in on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So they had security cameras in that hallway in the night of the shooting. Nobody noticed 200 rounds of bullets flying through the door into the hallway, or saw the security guard lying shot in the hallway for 18 minutes before the police randomly stumbled upon them. </p>

<p>Then they let the LVMPD repeatedly tell the public that the guard was shot at the end of the shooting spree. </p>

<p>And now on Day 8, they <em>finally</em> get around to checking the hallway footage outside the shooter&#39;s room and discover the guard was shot at 9:59? </p>
