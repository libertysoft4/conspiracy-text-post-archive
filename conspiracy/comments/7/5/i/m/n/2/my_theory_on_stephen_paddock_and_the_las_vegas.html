        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think paddock acted alone the entire time.  </p>

<p>His plan was to mount the weapons onto something (furniture or some type of mount) and firing them through his laptop.  A small switch mounted to the bump stock that when activated pressed and held the trigger.  In The 60 minutes interview they reported power tools and electronics all over.  Also explains why he would have made the calculations of what the angles/heights of where the guns should be. He never had the curtains open and they were firing in a predetermined spot not by sight.  Any snipers deployed would not be able to see anything in the room. I think he managed to get this setup in the room off the suite, locked the door and began setting up the suite the same way. </p>

<p>The night of the shooting Mandalay Bay was becoming suspicious of his behavior.  Something tipped them off. I find it hard to believe you can drill holes in walls and put brackets to lock stairwell doors without someone noticing or hearing something.</p>

<p>So they send a security guard up to investigate. There was never a door alarm, but don’t want to be liable for actually being suspicious of him before the shooting occurred. He hears the power tools in use and asks what’s going on. Wether paddock responded to his question or not I believe he attempted to open the door. That’s when it all unfolded. </p>

<p>This is why they gave him so much praise because he didn’t allow him to execute his full plan of automating all the guns and escaping before the firing began.  The whole operation could have been executed by remote computer and having the cameras to know when to shoot certain guns into the hallway/room. Making it seem like the room was occupied. </p>

<p>I see the whole plan as  some kind of final poker bluff/win to get back at the casinos.</p>

<p>I think Wynn has heard most of the details and believed that it would have been prevented in one of his casinos. The fbi feels that Mandalay Bay didn’t do anything unlawful so they don’t want to release too many details so that lawsuits could be filed against them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that would not function with a bump stock.  You could have a rapid firing solenoid work on a standard trigger to pull the trigger rapidly, but a trigger mechanism would not work with bump stocks.  If this was his plan, why have so many bump stocks if they couldnt be used?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats not how bump fire stocks work.  You hold youre finger or something in front of the trigger and have to constantly pull the rifle forward while holding the handle/stock backward.  The recoil &#39;bumps&#39; the rifle backward, then your constant forward pulling causes the rifle to slide forward and fire again.  It wouldnt be as simple as a trigger activation mechanism.  </p>

<p>The most elite special forces have actual UAVs and robots to do the shooting, they don&#39;t need to clamp guns to bedside tables.</p>

<p>The technology to mount a gun isn&#39;t inaccessible. The Mythbusters did it every other show. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mythbusters used a ransom rest which you can buy anywhere, yes you can mount it but there is no technology out there where it can aim the gun for you.  There is currently civilian technology where you can mount a gun and aim it using a laptop.  Yes the technology exist, the Israelis uses it to secure their border with Palestine, but that thing is huge much bigger than the hotel room that Paddock is in.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone is speculating that the guns would be <em>aimed</em> via a computer. I think OP is theorizing that he was going to manually clamp the guns in place, with fixed aim based on the calculations he had drawn up. The just computer control for the triggers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Years ago this tech was demonstrated by an inventor with a long YouTube video.  He used a paintball gun in the video for obvious reasons. His was fairly advanced, he had motion detecting software and the gun tracked and scores multiple hits on a person approaching.  A lot of things presumed to be only available to a government are actually readily made by technically gifted tinkerers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting theory. I have not seen any leaked photos of the second room, the one with the locked door. It would explain why the window was broken in the room and the door was locked behind him. I also found it odd when the one detective claimed he thought Paddock planned to escape. That didn&#39;t seem likely to me with the information we were given. I think he was too smart to think he could actually escape justice after pulling this off (he knew this would end in death) but maybe he planned to kill more people in a different location after leaving the hotel. That could explain the ammunition and explosives in his car. Why would Paddock fire 200 rounds through the door at a security guard that wasn&#39;t even knocking or showing interest in his room? The new detail that there was an unfinished hole drilled into the wall next to his door seems to support your theory. Maybe the guard did go to that floor to check an alarm but he heard power tools drilling next to Paddock&#39;s door and decided to investigate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your theory, it explains why we can’t get a straight answer, no one has ever done something like setup an attack robot and if he pulled it off and set a record doing it, everyone thinking of doing something like this would copy him and it could be relatively simple to setup.  Ie,. This might be the first of the next twenty years of shootings like this.  So the fbi and the cops want to hide this aspect.</p>

<p>Having the second gun set and automatically firing would explain how there was two shooters and the weird time gaps and inconsistencies in firing.  He has to reposition the other guns target using a computer screen so it takes a while to aim, reload, whatever.  Maybe there’s a timer on it so he waits for it to start shooting before he fires himself at the same time.</p>
