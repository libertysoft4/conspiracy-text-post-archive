        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is my first post ever but this is bothering me so much. The official narrative has changed so much in the past few days, which I 100% expected, but this shooting feels much more weighted than the others. First, there&#39;s video evidence of shots being fired before the automatic starts, but that&#39;s not talked about. Neither are the two shots that occurred after the automatic fire stops.</p>

<p>The timeline is fucked. Why would Campos not call in being shot at by 200 automatic rounds? Not to mention being hit? Why is there no record of him even existing? Why is CNN reporting that the shooter had tracer rounds and incendiary rounds, when previous reports said that he couldn&#39;t buy those rounds?</p>

<p>This is such a shit post and I know it, but I gotta get my thoughts out there.</p>

<p>Oh, not to mention, that all the news about Vegas is completely overshadowed by the whole Weinstein thing. Seriously, had CNN on just to check if the story had changed and it&#39;s been several hours since Vegas was even mentioned, no matter how brief.</p>

<p>Campos is definitely the biggest question in the entire thing.  They tried to not even mention their change of story regarding Campos, saying it was a minute change?  Give me a break, it was a huge change.  </p>

<p>The public is not buying it at all, and they are trying to figure out how to fix that.</p>
