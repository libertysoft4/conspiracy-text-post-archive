<p>Yes it&#39;s believable one could do this, I don&#39;t know what kind of (Edit: due to the snowflake response I have replaced the word  &quot;cuck&quot; with something else for their delicate sensibilities) <strong>weakling person</strong> you are if you can&#39;t imagine how exactly he could carry out an attack like that. Yes, it&#39;s believable a white person would shoot at a crowd you believe are completely composed of white people just like him. Yes, it&#39;s believable a millionaire could do this and money doesn&#39;t buy happiness but it could buy a fuck load of guns for a person done with life.</p>

<p>Why is always the real question. And maybe we&#39;ll never know why. We&#39;ll never know exactly why many mass shootings take place. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of speculative accusations around here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The investigation isn&#39;t even complete yet. I know the internet is the age of instant gratification but if you want access to cameras from casinos, I&#39;d suggest you become a cop or a casino mogul. </p>

<p>2 separate weapons sounded like an echo to me.</p>

<p>BTW there is no &quot;official&quot; narrative besides this is another run of the mill mass shooting. You do understand if you&#39;re an American citizen with money you can do exactly what he did, right? </p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying to stay skeptical of the official narrative and what others are making up at the moment just because you don&#39;t believe something like this could happen in a country where people can buy everything he had.</p>

<p>Also we saw the Tsarnev brothers hours after the bombing from CCTV around the marathon. Why cant they show a clip of him at the casino in the days leading up to the shooting?</p>

<p>There are plenty of crazy ass theories flying around with this, this sub has seen a lot of new users in the last week alone wondering about this incident. My problem is the feds aren&#39;t giving anything up other than little bread crumbs to keep the media happy and talking. I know its an active investigation but there is something they can share. Also YouTube censoring videos and deleting uploads. </p>

<p>Gunshots are loud as fuck. People thought there was a shooting in Caesar&#39;s place or something too but when I saw the video it was a distant pop.</p>

<p>You forget they were looking for the Tsarnev brothers, we know who this guy was because he was found dead there. This mass shooter does what other mass shooters do when they realize the cops are closing in. Tsarnev brothers didn&#39;t even shoot their way out, if you remember the police shot at a boat trying to kill both and got one.</p>

<p>We got a massive leak of the crime scene. Which was big but it clearly shows one person could do that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure they threw a flashbang in the boat. Youre right about the active man hunt. </p>

<p>Vegas may be a lone wolf or it may be a much bigger operation. I believe there is much more to the story other than it was just some old white dude who lost his shit. </p>

<p>As far as the gunshots we hear, both arguments can be held and they have been. I lean towards multiple shooters or at least Paddock being a patsy. The main reason I say that is the pics we get of the room with the rifle laying over his feet and the chest wound. Seems to fishy to me. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Is it easier to believe he lost his shit? OR that he converted to Islam or was antifa?</p>

<p>Him being a patsy raises more questions than it answers. It sounds like you just don&#39;t believe a person is capable of this kind of thing. Besides what I&#39;m saying is that if he was a patsy we&#39;d have camera footage from the casino showing everyone who possibly got onto an elevator from that floor. The guy shot for a really long time unloading near a 1000 rounds to hit 500+ as police swarm every entrance and exit to the 32nd floor of the casino. </p>

<p>Then if he was a patsy you&#39;d need to find a real culprit and motive for them shooting at the concert instead of an old guy who lost his shit. I don&#39;t even know if Paddock had children. Did he even have a good life being rich?</p>

<p>One of the most famous patsies in history is Lee Harvey Oswald and the JFK assassination had multiple shooters. </p>

<p>They should show us the footage no matter what. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The shots only lasted 10-15 minutes, why did it take 72 to breach?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, look at the JFK assassination. We still dont know &quot;Who&quot; did it. And by a happy accident the CIA lost all the Oswald files. </p>

<p>Absolutely. It&#39;s entirely possible the shooting was some black op but the casinos have cameras and after the investigation is complete we might see he was alone. </p>

<p>Once the investigation is considered closed and they don&#39;t have proof he was alone in a casino with tons of cameras then I could understand the wild speculations presented as fact. But I imagine right now they are looking at all his movements on the cameras to see if there was anything relevant or other accomplices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s just obvious to most intelligent people that things don&#39;t add up. The biggest problem for me is the fact that there are many many witnesses saying that there were multiple shooters at multiple locations and that there are police officers on the scanner audio confirming multiple shooters—not saying &#39;maybe,&#39; not saying &#39;reports of&#39; or &#39;apparently&#39;— actually saying &#39;confirmed&#39; multiple shooters. Yet the media is not interviewing these people or writing stories about what these people are saying and queestioning the authorities about it, yet they are putting out stories from a hooker that apparently used to service Paddock. How does that make sense in the world we&#39;re supposed to be living in, a world where journalists investigate and hold authority to account, a world where law enforcement protects citizens and wants to get to the bottom of crimes like this and wants to give the public as much info as possible without jeopardizing their investigation?</p>

<p>It makes no sense at all. And so it&#39;s obvious that they are lying, that the media isn&#39;t working on behalf of truth and the people, and that something else is going on that they feel the need to lie about. So yeah people are going to theorize and speculate, but that&#39;s a good thing and it&#39;s an important thing, because if we just roll over and let &#39;the authorities&#39; lie to us about these situations that are literally a matter of life and death for innocent people, without even questioning it or making at least a little of a fuss and putting up at least a bit of resistance then we&#39;re putting ourselves in an incredibly dangerous position.</p>

<p>Can you name a single <em>insert subjective trait about an accused mass shooter</em> who ever shot people in this manor?</p>

<p>Most of these new mass shootings are happening with AR-15 variant rifles. I&#39;m not in favor of gun control but it&#39;s pretty obvious that people who actually would carry out something like this would have the capability to fire at least 30 rounds of 5.56 into a crowd of people.</p>
