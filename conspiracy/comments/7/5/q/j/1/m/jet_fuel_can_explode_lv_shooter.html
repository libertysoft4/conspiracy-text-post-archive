        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I was mass downvoted in <a href="/r/Topmindsofreddit">/r/Topmindsofreddit</a> on a linked topic I was upvoted on mostly on this subreddit. All of them were basically saying I was a liar and stupid. I&#39;m not going to call them shills, today, if anyone hurts your mental ego or model of reality they are called a shill. I really don&#39;t blame them. My theories are quite a stretch from the norm. Anyways if you want to see the discussion it&#39;s in my history. Here&#39;s a link to the topic I posted here previously describing my theory more fully. I am not claiming my theory to be absolute fact.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/75mjs9/what_in_the_world_steve_wynn_las_vegas_what_is/?st=J8MLT957&amp;amp;sh=6f3ba5e6">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/75mjs9/what_in_the_world_steve_wynn_las_vegas_what_is/?st=J8MLT957&amp;amp;sh=6f3ba5e6</a></p>

<p>Actual Post: What I want to post about here is that I believe the LV attack was supposed to be much bigger. Another redditor pointed out in another thread that the Tannernite in the LV attacker&#39;s car may have been planned to be used to blow up the 44,000 barrels of jet fuel tanks. Ordinarily just shooting at jet fuel tanks will not make them explode. However, that does not mean they can not explode if Tannernite is first exploded next to it. The other sub-reddit basically completely disagreed with this proposition both theoretically and scientifically. Mostly we were talking about aerosolizing jet fuel. I don&#39;t understand why they completely misunderstood what I was saying. Perhaps I was being unclear. My grammar has sucked these past few days.</p>

<p>Anyways, here are a few link bombs regardless of who was right in those threads:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aaccessmaps.com/images/maps/us/nv/lasvegas_sostrip/lasvegas_sostrip.gif">http://www.aaccessmaps.com/images/maps/us/nv/lasvegas_sostrip/lasvegas_sostrip.gif</a></p>

<p>Notice the right window and the gun picture of the right window and the note probably being reported by police as calculations.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/OqxOI">http://archive.is/OqxOI</a></p>

<p>CNN reports that he fired two incendiary rounds.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_liquid_expanding_vapor_explosion">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_liquid_expanding_vapor_explosion</a></p>

<p>And...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermobaric_weapon#Fuel-air_explosive">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermobaric_weapon#Fuel-air_explosive</a></p>

<p>Exactly what I was trying to describe to them. Two explosions, first one creates the environment necessary for the second one.</p>

<p>My best guess is that the plan somehow failed and the other person who was supposed to help place the car bailed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a 9/11 level event was planned, but foiled whilst it was in operation and <em>ultimately</em> failed. </p>

<p>The first interview with Eric Paddock was strange to watch and appeared unprepared, possibly because Stephen Paddock wasnt supposed to be the centre of a mass media focus - the massive casualties of 1-October and what was going to be done about that would have been. </p>

<p>I believe this may have been in part, orchestrated by a defeated Democratic Party, to force the Republican Administration into war, and gun control talks.  At some point that practically guarantees the Democrats will return to power (because who really wants Republican war) and can be the heros that withdraw us from war. 16 years ago, something similar happened. </p>

<p>Perhaps Harvey Weinstein has fallen on his sword to fill up air time and distract us from what the real focus should be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the blowing up fuel tanks thing is a media angle gone too far. Yes they are kind of that direction and yes what a nightmare that would have been... but... you don&#39;t plan on making a fuel tank explode from 400 plus yards away and use the equipment he had.  He had the money and he could have bought a .50 cal on several different platforms to get this job done.  Seems to me that a guy who did all this planning and bought all these guns would have just thrown the big boy in there to light the fire.  And that&#39;s assuming this was all his idea and acted alone.  If there was someone behind this in a bigger conspiracy, they&#39;d have thought of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would to an ordinary gas tank, but jet fuel is designed to function under different circumstances (e.g temperature, pressure, amount of oxygen needed for combustion). </p>

<p>If the tanks were to explode the damage would not be from the explosion but from the effects of the explosion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The [blast] kill mechanism against living targets is unique–and unpleasant.... What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent rarefaction [vacuum], which ruptures the lungs.... If the fuel deflagrates but does not detonate, victims will be severely burned and will probably also inhale the burning fuel. Since the most common FAE fuels, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, are highly toxic, undetonated FAE should prove as lethal to personnel caught within the cloud as most chemical agents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if you were not in line of sight you are going to suffer from tremendous pressure exerted from the blast</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m also having a hard time seeing your point.. Are you saying he wanted to use the tannerite to cause a thermobaric explosion? I&#39;m not sure how that would work. A thermobaric bomb works by dispersing fuel with oxygen already in the air and then igniting it. How was he planning on getting all the fuel in the tanks dispersed into the air? </p>

<p>Personally I just think he was ignorant enough (thanks hollywood) to think shooting a big gas tank with an incendiary bullet would cause a big explosion. </p>
