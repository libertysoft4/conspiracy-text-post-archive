        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They said that he was shooting a sniper rifle out of the guest room window at the fuel tanks. Only problem is that they had to breach the locked guest door with explosives(as heard in audio tapes), and he didn&#39;t even need to switch windows to shoot the tanks (you want proof of that? look up mandalay bay hotel and look for yourself). He had a great angle to shoot the tanks from either window. They couldn&#39;t explain the second window with their narrative, and they literally used the same story that anti-conspiracy shills on here were spouting. Proof that the fuel tank story is bullshit is there if you know anything about how that fuel works and burns. The fuel in that storage tank burns VERY similar to diesel, and only with a sustained fire and a BLEVE explosion can a tank even explode with any force. A BLEVE explosion is what happens when a boiling liquid forces an explosion due to increased pressure and heat. This literally couldn&#39;t take place due to a sniper&#39;s incendiary fire. The bullet, regardless of it being incendiary or not, would not have been able to create the extended heat required for the fuel to ignite and explode. Paddock would have researched this and knew that, especially if he was the one who shot the fuel tanks. Couple this fact with the story that the LVPD released, which says that incendiary rounds were found, holes were patched, and the situation was cleared by the FBI. Notice <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/10/us/las-vegas-shooter-incendiary-rounds/index.html">this</a> article shows a source that isn&#39;t named, give information about his fuel tank shooting. <strong>They even say the company that owns the tanks wasn&#39;t available for comments.</strong> You know why? Because it didn&#39;t happen. They are deliberately preying on uninformed individuals who don&#39;t know anything about that attack except that &quot;a bad guy shot a lot of people&quot;. People see explosions in movies and equate that to real life, and without knowledge or research(like I&#39;ve done), they can easily fool the masses. Let me make this abundantly clear: <strong>They (LVPD, FBI) know bullets cannot trigger a fuel tank explosion.</strong> The only problem is the majority of people glance at the article or only read the title, and automatically assume he did these things, because he was already committing such horrifying acts. People just neglect the facts and topple that story on the list of the their preconceptions about the shooting.  </p>

<p>TL;DR: No proof the tanks were shot, &quot;FBI cleaned the scene and patched holes immediately&quot;, also airplane fuel tanks don&#39;t explode due to incendiary fire. This isn&#39;t a Michael Bay movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, what the fuck is the deal? the one clear discussion I&#39;m having with a redditor is someone that I recognize and have commented to before. No one else has commented. I noticed a few days ago, before the fuel tank story, that people were saying the second window was for the fuel tanks. He didn&#39;t even need the second window to hit the fuel tanks. That&#39;s a shitty assumption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is your point that Paddock didn&#39;t shoot the tanks or that <em>no one</em> did? I mean, a lot of people think the car full of explosives was supposed to blow up the tank and whoever was supposed to complete that part of the op fell through for some reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, both. I don&#39;t think Paddock would have shot them, because he would have done research (imo). I also think that no one shot them, because the owner of the tanks didn&#39;t comment, only an FBI proxy did.

    <div class="md"><p>the fact is that anyone experienced with the fuel tanks he was shooting at would know that it couldn&#39;t be a target. It wouldn&#39;t have exploded after the incendiary fire. This is a perfect opportunity for them to explain the second window without controversy, while also creating more panic around &quot;what could have happened&quot;. People glance over the title and now hate Paddock even more for &quot;trying to shoot and explode tanks&quot;, when there&#39;s no actual proof he shot them. You could say he didn&#39;t know the tanks would explode, but I reckon that isn&#39;t the case, since conveniently the news story doesn&#39;t include a source from the tank&#39;s owner. That, <strong>to me</strong>, sounds like the tanks weren&#39;t even shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first of all I don&#39;t believe Paddock&#39;s window was broken during the shooting. I had a popular post on here about a week back showing that Paddock&#39;s window wasn&#39;t broken during the shooting,  the guest room&#39;s was though. I think they&#39;re using the fuel tank story to give a reason for the guest room window. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, also have you seen the photo of the broken window? Paddock wouldn&#39;t have been able to shoot on a stand out the window, and I don&#39;t think he would have laid down either. There were two large shards of hanging glass covering half of the window. He didn&#39;t have the weapon that could have been used imo, the fire rate was too exactly 10/sec to be bump-stock fire(imo, again). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok hear me out on this one. Pull up <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/10/us/las-vegas-shooter-incendiary-rounds/index.html">this</a> video and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74htbb/video_from_outside_mandalay_bay_2_single_hand_gun/">this</a> video. Go to :20 on the TMZ video and 2:16 on the other one. They have the same burst happening, and it&#39;s exactly 1 minute: 10 seconds before the muzzle flash. I think it&#39;s a pistol shot breaking the window.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just in case its of relevance to the angle youre taking.... the maintenance guy said that he was 1/3 down the hall and couldnt see anyone because the rooms are set back a foot from the hall, then campos popped out from the side. the suite was at the end of the hall, the guest room is the one set back. that means campos was at the suite door investigating drilling sounds, but the bullets came from the suite door. if he was at the suite door then when was the camera set up because the service trolley was right in front of the door.</p>

<p>not sure if any of that is relevant, just some observations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, so locking it from the other side won&#39;t slow anyone down on that side. It just prevents him from going back into the second room. </p>

<p>And remember that security and maintenance are shot at from the suite and there&#39;s no report of Paddock exiting at any point. That would mean that Paddock broke the window in the second room, locked the connecting door and went back to the suite though the hall before ever firing a shot. Which would mean no shots were fired from the second room or there was someone else in there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yep, im not saying it makes sense, just pointing out that what was being said could not be taken as a fact.</p>

<p>i dont think they were clear on where they were shot at from. the maintenance guy just said the end of the hall and he wasnt sure which room? being unsure of which room suggests it wasnt the suit door, there would be no confusion, one of the doors to the side would make it difficult to tell exactly which one it was if he was at the other end of the hall.</p>

<p>remember the service cart was in front of that door with the camera on it, the police were there at 12 mins or so, the stairwell was was barricaded.</p>

<p>maybe the connecting door wasnt even locked...</p>

<p>What? How am I stretching anything? You&#39;re saying there&#39;s only one possible reason they&#39;d breach the door, and I&#39;m telling you that&#39;s false. There are multiple reasons to breach a door, locked or unlocked. It may have been locked, but since not one person who was there has explicitly stated that the door was locked, you&#39;re merely speculating. Unless you can tell me where on the audio it says &quot;there&#39;s a locked door in here, we have to breach,&quot; it is 100% NOT fact that the connecting door was locked. </p>

That still doesn&#39;t answer why he has a perfect angle already to shoot the tanks? He didn&#39;t need the second room. Do you remember when this first happened? People on here were talking about how he might have been aiming for the fuel tanks out of the second window. That was before the story broke that the fuel tanks were shot. Now, they changed their story to corroborate that of complete speculation a few days ago. Why? Because that&#39;s the only story they can broadcast without shattering the narrative. Seriously, can you think of another reason  Paddock needed the guest room? He had 10+ windows in his suite, half of which could hit all the people and the fuel tanks. </p>
