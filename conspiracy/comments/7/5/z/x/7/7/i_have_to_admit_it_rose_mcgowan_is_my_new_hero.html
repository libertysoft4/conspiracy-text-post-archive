    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>people treat women like a fucking delicate flower and men like shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re kidding right??... For the most part, women are definitely not treated like a delicate flower... look at how the women who accused Bill Cosby have been treated in the media. Dismissed, called liars and money hungry, ripped apart by the media and society... Look at how the women that accused Bill Clinton were treated, or the woman that accused Kobe Bryant. The list goes on.. We live in a society where victim blaming happens constantly whether you want to accept that or not. Timing is everything and yes, right now women are being supported for coming out but you&#39;re a fucking fool if you actually believe women are always treated like &quot;a delicate flower&quot; Are you upset they&#39;re being heralded for their bravery???? </p>

<p>It&#39;s horrible the way that Feldman was ignored but I think that&#39;s probably for a few reasons. 1) studies prove that people find it harder to believe that males can be victims of sexual assault 2) he didn&#39;t drop actual names, only mild references to who he was talking about and it&#39;s clearly some big wigs in Hollywood. The women coming out right now have specifically named Weinstein... huge difference. 3) If Hollywood owns the media, did you actually expect them to welcome his accusations with open arms and show that he&#39;s a victim? And 4) there are SOOOO many people coming out against Weinstein right now that they can&#39;t deny it or bury this story and Feldman was the only one to make statements about what he endured.</p>

<p>Praising women for finally coming out against their abuser doesn&#39;t equate to some kind of special treatment nor does it have any relevance to how Feldman was treated so get your mind right before you say dumb shit like that </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dude has basically publicly admitted all this, and he paid a settlement to McGowan to shut her up, because that was the only avenue of justice available to her. And yet, you still got to come in here and blame the victim!</p>

<p>See, everything that happened to her demonstrates that a culture exists that uses politics, the media, and officers of the court to protect rich and powerful people like admitted &quot;problem&quot;-having Weinstein.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what you should really be concerned about rather than the physical evidence supporting McGowan&#39;s story. With like the vast majority of rape, there is none, because many rape victims need time, sometimes significant amounts of it, to actually process their violation(s). </p>

But I can see her starting to teeter a little into radicalized feminism and she&#39;s going to start losing people by being overly offputting and aggressive.  Now males saying they are with her aren&#39;t enough and she&#39;s effectively shitting on any man who is not currently DOING something.

<p>While I respect her speaking out, I&#39;m unsure about the way in which she&#39;s approaching this. It&#39;s like she has a list of names that she strikes through one per day. Burning down as many people as she can.. (I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t believe they deserve it).
She dated a staunch luceferian, vocally supported Obama throughout his term and she is known for her involvement in paganism and the occult.
That isn&#39;t to say that I doubt any of her claims. I just want to point out who the individual making these claims actually is, and that perhaps the reasons for her actions aren&#39;t as apparent as they may seem. Looking for a hero to be a role model? Edward Snowden acted selflessly.. Rose Mcgowen acts to serve Rose Mcgowen&#39;s own interest.</p>

By her accepting the $100k payoff and her continued public silence after her rape, how much does that make her an accessory to the further sexual predator behavior of Weinstein that could have been prevented if she spoke up?  I say she is right to call BA out on the hypocrisy of his Weinstein statement, but she is just as guilty as the rest of Hollywood for what happened to every woman after her.</p>
