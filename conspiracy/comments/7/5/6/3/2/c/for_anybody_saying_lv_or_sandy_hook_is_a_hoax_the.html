<p>If you believe the government to be completely corrupt and soulless (as it often can be), why wouldn&#39;t they just blow up several hundred people and then blame ISIS? No loose ends.

</blockquote>

<p>Hmm, do you have any evidence at all that the people on the news actually are grieving? Is it possible they are just acting out a script?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re the one making the extraordinary claim of a grand conspiracy </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where did I make a claim? Surely the default position, until <strong>evidence proves otherwise</strong> is that the only thing that happened is what we can prove. Otherwise we are just taking claims on someone&#39;s authority and that&#39;s a classic logical fallacy.</p>

<p>So what evidence do we have, and what can we prove?</p>

<p>Is media footage of unconvincing performances enough to satisfy you? Is a single video showing no injuries and lots of fake blood enough? How about the complete absence of crime scene protocol? How about several videos of people at the scene saying &quot;those aren&#39;t gunshots&quot;? Or the total lack of video evidence for even a single round striking anyone or anything?</p>

<p>I could go on. The point is there&#39;s no evidence that a crime even took place at all, because this type of  exercise and the ensuing propaganda is perfectly legal to use on the American public.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>because 4 of the dead were Canadians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What evidence (other than media reports) do you have for this claim?</p>

<p>You CANNOT trust anything reported by the media. Is this a difficult concept?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why fake it at all?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d only be speculating, because there are many plausible possibilities...</p>

<p>To practice real world incident response? To instill fear in the public, which allows rights to be stripped away via reactionary legislation (Hegelian dialectic - aka Problem-Reaction-Solution)? As an occult ritual? For sport among the elites, who use gofundme accounts like a high score table?</p>

<p>In truth I have no idea. They are all somewhat plausible when you start digging and doing your own research, but the key thing is to establish WHAT happened first. Only then should we try to answer the questions of WHY, WHO, HOW etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why fake shoot people and have to worry about loose ends </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are far more loose ends to control in a real shooting. Actual relatives of murdered individuals tend to pursue justice. Actors? Not so much. It&#39;s all about risk mitigation via control. The organisers of these events control every aspect of them from end to end.</p>

<p>The news you see in the media is entirely made up of manufactured and controlled stories that serve to push a specific narrative, plus brainless entertainment filler that doesn&#39;t matter, or which programs the audience in other ways useful to TPTB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because if they were actors you need at least 600 people in the crowd to be in on it. Basically every nurse and doctor in the Las Vegas area, every paramedic, every cop. The coroners office, the funeral homes. you&#39;d need to hire family and friends for these fake people. Fake jobs, at real places with complicit coworkers etc etc.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t believe ANYTHING the media says, not just in the US but all over the world, then you&#39;re basically limited to what you can see out your window. Y&#39;know that Hurricane Harvey thing.. didn&#39;t happen /s.</p>

<p>There&#39;s not even much point in discussing it at this point because your response to any point I can make is to just shout &quot;fake news, never happened.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was been no control of the narrative. There have been lawsuits. Evidence? 99.9% of the country has already moved on. It&#39;s over. What effect? Maybe bump stocks get banned, a year down the road. That&#39;s it. No one cares enough to break this down, because it had no effect on their daily life, they have jobs, kids, bills, plans, iphones, video games, none of that got put on hold. </p>

<p>At best, the gun control lobby got a little stronger. Most people support tougher laws. So it&#39;s liberals, Dems, who are funding shadow orgs to commit mass murders to get stricter gun laws? And if they get caught it back fires and people realize the govt is the enemy. Or they just use the money and run tv,radio,newspaper,magazine ads promoting stricter gun laws like ever other fucking lobby does, its highly effective, no risk of backlash, and of course no fellow americans die. </p>

<p>The funny thing is, the &#39;shadow orgs&#39; don&#39;t even care what the laws are! They do what they want. People think this is all about changing laws? lol. Why would they give a shit about the laws? The govt does what it wants, something being illegal doesn&#39;t slow them down one bit. </p>

<p>So at the end of the day, its probably just a nutjob who went off the deep end. But the important thing to remember is, TIMES UP, NO ONE CARES ANYMORE. The truth won&#39;t change anything anymore then the perceived truth did. The system is setup so very few people have the fucking time to stop and &#39;investigate&#39; some rampage 1500 miles away. Even if the FBI admits it, people would say &#39;hopefully people get fired and go to jail thats fucked up - shit gotta get to bed work at 6am&#39;. It&#39;s a flash, its a blur, it was horrible, world if full of crazy people, we sorta knew that. Meh.</p>

<p>Also…your point that all TPTB need to do is wait for an actual mass event rests heavily on the notion that most mass events are not already carried out or at least manufactured by them.</p>

<p>My take on LV is it was a false flag. Real victims…fake perpetrator.</p>

<p>As far as SH goes…well…after several years of investigation I have still yet to see any actual <em>evidence</em> (not a narrative or the word of authorities) that 27 people died. If you have feel free to pass it along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be easier, but these things don’t happen on the regular, so pushing it on the people with massive events is the most effective and efficient way. Sandy hook, (look up Dear Wolfgang) is a hoax. This is a false flag. I hear a lot circulating that the 59 didn’t die but if you listen to the audio from the police scanner, they aren’t fucking around and if they are, the hospitals are in on this too? It’s possible when you consider capstone. There’s tons of photographs and videos being taken down that I watched every bit of as they came out and that plus the police scanner, there are clearly multiple shooters, and people acting as distractions. Listen to my podcast Working Class Gyros on SoundCloud, I go through and break down all the main points of the action and talk about the video footage plus more in depth on paddock himself and possible motives.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we will see this used as an example to arm local police more heavily. The 60 minutes interview mentioned at least twice how outmatched the cops felt with pistols. Almost all of the coverage so far has been about how many powerful weapons he had. Don&#39;t think that won&#39;t come up at next year&#39;s police budget review in your town.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I never said this event wasn&#39;t being manipulated. I&#39;m asking why would the government fake this instead of just letting it happen and using it to their advantage? Waaaaay fucking easier to let something happen then orchestrate it all yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone has already forgotten James hodgkinson targeting baseball playing republican congressmen? If there hadn’t been effective capitol police there with guns, he’d have killed many before the Alexandria police arrived.</p>

<p>If you looked at twitter right after the LAS shooting, lots of people on there were delighted that s bunch of white republicans had been killed, because, you know, who else likes country music?</p>
