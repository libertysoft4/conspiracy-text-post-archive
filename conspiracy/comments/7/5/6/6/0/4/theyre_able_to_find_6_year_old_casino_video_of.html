    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think they are going to release any video of him to the public right away, or at all? What obligation do they have to share their private security footage with anyone other than law enforcement? Why would they open themselves up to any potential legal action, or reveal their security set-up? Why would they willingly prolong terrible PR and negative advertisement? This is a business after all. </p>

<p>Once the footage is being used as evidence you will get to see it, along with the rest of us. Law enforcement isn&#39;t going to release what they have on an active investigation because that&#39;s obviously against common sense and I imagine a bunch of protocols, and the hotel won&#39;t for reasons listed in the paragraph above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, first, you gotta relax, this is a conspiracy subreddit, designed to inform people, because he didn&#39;t know the video was used in a prior lawsuit doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s ignorant. If anyone is being ignorant here, it&#39;s you dude, it doesn&#39;t matter if the video is being used in an investigation right now, if Stephen Paddock was a LONE SHOOTER, then they should have at least released screenshots from the security footage, and yes they are obligated to do that, because hiding information from the public and expecting people to believe your narrative is exactly why conspiracy theories are a thing. Now if you want to be toxic, I recommend a different subreddit. Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re coming off as awfully hostile and demeaning for someone who is trying to frame me as such.</p>

<p>As to your argument that they should release that information? Who should release it, and why? I already explained why the hotel won&#39;t release it, and why the police won&#39;t. I backed my argument with logic and a reasonable argument. </p>

<p>A conspiracy subreddit that&#39;s &quot;designed to inform people&quot; should take the time to fill their theories with valid, accurate information and with logical, reasonable arguments. If you can&#39;t manage that, then your theory isn&#39;t a very good one and should be discussed on those exact terms. </p>

<p>Otherwise any theory is as valid as any other, and you and I both know that&#39;s not true. The theory that Godzilla is really ruling the world from a secret Moon lair doesn&#39;t deserve to be taken as seriously as a theory with reasonable logic and proof behind it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting angle.  I&#39;ve been thinking that the CONCERT organizers could be held liable.  I&#39;ve been to college football games (large campus, popular and often top ranking team) where the police secured building rooftops that were close enough to the stadium (actually they had marksmen on top of dorm towers).   That was three or four years ago, so standard OP for event security, I&#39;d think for a crowd that size.  You&#39;ve gotta think -- nightclub, concert and party shootings are somewhat common. Not crazed mass shooting types, but &quot;gangster driveby after an argument&quot; types that kill a hand full of people are common.  Any reasonable organizer of an event that size can&#39;t really say &quot;oh nobody could consider this a danger&quot;.  Especially in Las Vergas, where gunfire is commonplace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked for a Casino and did a lot with the surveillance systems.</p>

<p>They have footage they could dial up from I would reckon over 2500 cameras around the building with 20 minutes notice. </p>

<p>They would have him entering, exiting and breaking the glass out of his room. (There is a 360 camera right above the section where his room was.) </p>

<p>I was working at the Casino when a man was killed by security and the footage was produced the following day to the police.</p>

<p>There might not be as much recording around the hotel as the gaming floor but storage is cheap for what they need to cover.</p>

<p>If they could film you practicing your gaming techniques in your room they would do it to give the house any advantage it can get.
(Though they would never let that get out.)</p>
