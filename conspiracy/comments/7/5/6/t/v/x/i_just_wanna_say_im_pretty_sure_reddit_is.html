I resubbed (left for awhile due to T_D brigading) and was really enjoying everything coming from here showing up on my front page. I don&#39;t quite have the time to research and pore over this shit some of you guys do, so I&#39;m really just a casual observer, but I still take it all in. Within the past 2 days or so however, it seems like I haven&#39;t seen ANY r/conspiracy posts on my front page. Not one. I&#39;ve had to come to the subreddit specifically to see any new information. Now idk if the flow of info has just slowed down and posts haven&#39;t been getting high enough quick enough, but I fear there may be some suppression from Reddit itself here. Anyone else have this issue?</p>

<p>Rubbish. It shows that he&#39;s aware of one thing we&#39;re almost universally famous for (unless maybe you just don&#39;t get outside much). It&#39;s not hotly disputed nor should it be controversial to point it out, and it certainly doesn&#39;t warrant a veiled shill accusation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah he is the biggest outlier amongst us but still bashes others as if they were a shill and we dont notice lol  Im weary of any assholes not looking for discussion and super nice people trying to sway you and dump info in your lap.  i like to walk the line and never really settle on anything.  people have to keep in mind were trying to put a puzzle together without eyes, any theory goes even if its really out there.  If info and knowledge are surpressed then why is it too much of a reach to think that TPTB figured out how to use energy around us? or that they are willing to murder thousands to remain in power? or that there is a huge pedo ring? Why are aliens helping TPTB too far fetched?

<p>It seems that there is a push to declare people who question the truth, as mentally ill, and I hope that people on this sub protect themselves, as I have read many posts trying to say others need mental help. What is mental help? These days, it&#39;&#39;s a fifteen minute visit with a person who prescribes a bizarre medication that warns of suicidal thought.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t fall in step with view point &quot;A&quot;, or view point &quot;B&quot;, you are a tin foil hat wearing psycho and your opinion isn&#39;t valid.
