<p>is this an msm website where they put their story across or is it a website where lots of easily debunked theories and <strong>assumptions</strong> are posted? </p>

<p>if something is easily debunked, would it not be hypocritical and dishonest not to say so?</p>

<p>why should the msm be immediately dismissed as false, but everything here should be blindly accepted as the truth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because the media and authorities have been sharing precious little actual evidence with the public. I&#39;ve only seen two photos of the man circulating since this happened. Have you seen more? Like I said, you comment incessantly day and night, yet never seem to know anything beyond your limited MSM viewpoints. This is my subjective opinion and can be disagreed with, but you comment history is very telling imho. </p>

<p>no photo was mentioned in OP&#39;s video so how was i to know which one the comment was about.</p>

<p>i probably do share some viewpoints of the msm, and i certainly dont have an issue with evidence not being released yet. but if youre going to ignore what i say in favour of your agenda then then i dont beleive youre as subjective as yo would like to believe</p>

<p>Wynn obviously knows WAY more than anyone but law enforcement.  I don&#39;t think much happens in Vegas that he isn&#39;t privy to.  Pretty much everyone in town needs to act like they are on his payroll, because either they are, or they will be replaced by someone who is.</p>

<p>Plus, even without the dark politics, just as a casino owner, they are going to get more information quickly to adjust security measures.</p>

<p>This is exactly right. In a civil suit Paddock filed against the Cosmopolitan he states on record that he never drank while playing, in order to keep his wits and not make mistakes. </p>

<p>So Wynn probably never saw him actually drinking, so he just assumed he didn&#39;t drink. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the deposition Paddock said he gambled 14 hours a day, 365 days a year. That leaves ten hours for boozing and sleep. It also said they found a bottle of Valium which contained around 14 pills left out of 60. But the bottle was over a year old. </p>

<p>I’m no conspiracy person per se, but I find the media and govt to be completely fishy with this entire thing. Nothing concrete ever just adds up. </p>

<p>The deposition was for a slip and fall lawsuit against the cosmopolitan hotel. If he was a guy gambling a million dollars a day, they would suck his dick here to Sunday if he slipped and fell in their casino. The hotel ended up winning that case. Strange</p>

<p>Considering the facts of what we know about his player&#39;s card and the way he approached gambling as a &quot;job&quot; it is entirely possible that he drank when &quot;not working&quot;, i.e. play high stakes video poker for mostly perks.</p>
