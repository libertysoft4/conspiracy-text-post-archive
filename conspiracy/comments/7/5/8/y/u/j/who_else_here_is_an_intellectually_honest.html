        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I thought it might be helpful to quell the constant shill accusations by letting this sub see that there are many of us who have digested all of the evidence that we could find and remain unconvinced that the Podestas/Alefantis/Comet Pizza are involved in any way with child pornography or human trafficking. Please note that I am not saying it’s impossible - of course it’s possible. I’ve often been surprised by the things that seemingly warm-hearted people have done. But none of the emails, Instagram posts, or ‘creepy’ art have convinced me that something nefarious is going on, and I truly believe it’s unjust to spread a narrative that these people are monsters based on such flimsy &amp; circumstantial (at best) evidence. It frightens me because it would be so easy to ruin the lives of innocent people if that’s all it took to damn someone in the public imagination. 
And that is precisely why I don’t want to ignore this. I don’t want to see our curiosity weaponized by anyone. And I want people to see that, yes, conspiracy theorists can be skeptics too, and that to defend someone accused of vile crimes is not equivalent to defending those crimes. I’m also not saying that people should stop looking critically at things. What I’m wary of is the fact that so many users become entirely convinced by relatively weak evidence and then begin pushing the narrative that person X is certainly guilty of crime Y, and that if anyone objects then they are part of the problem. That’s absurd! And it’s very dangerous, since it pollutes our discourse and makes it so much more difficult for people to see truth for themselves.</p>

<p>I have a friend who is a big Vikings fan who didn&#39;t want to believe it or kept excusing it as no big deal, even though the guy admitted it.(That running back is no longer a Viking and my buddy has a different opinion on the situation now)</p>

<p>I think a lot of the people(who aren&#39;t paid to say so online) that think there&#39;s nothing wrong with the pedo bands, the years of pedo innuendo and pics of children/babies on Alefantis&#39; Instagram, the creepy art of Tony Podesta, the code words in Podesta emails, etc etc are like my friend but their favorite team is the Democrats. And the Democrats have told them it&#39;s an attack on all of them so they put blinders on and defend the pedos as one of their own..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems like a poor comparison. Presumably there would be direct evidence that the boy’s scrotum was injured, and there was also an admission of guilt. In the case of pizzagate, there is nothing that directly suggests that any children were harmed. If you have evidence to the contrary, I’d like to see it. But the art and emails do not a pedophile make. </p>

<p>Someone figured out that one of the guys that &#39;liked&#39; a lot of his pedo innuendo posts was an FBI agent that is in a division that investigates these things. They have people in the inside protecting them.</p>

<p>As far as victims, have you heard of Saville? When he took some of the royals out on his boat, they would throw the kids overboard after they were done with them. When the predators are that high of a level, they don&#39;t run the risk of potential future witnesses to testify.</p>

Have you ever heard of the Streisand effect? By fighting the accusations directly, they would only stir up a hornet nest of trolls and would be waging a meme war that would onsume every waking moment of their lives. If they are innocent, and I have no reason to believe otherwise at this time, then they’re in an awful situation as it is. Responding to their aggressors would probably only make things worse. If people are truly convinced of their guilt, then they need to raise a civil suit against them! (Since the police seem unconvinced as well.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following since the very beginning... and I will admit, 100%, there is no concrete evidence whatsoever. It could all be nothing more than coincidence. </p>

<p>However, the contents of the artwork, the censorship, the logos, the deletion of profiles/entire sub-reddits/de-monetization of YouTube channels, death threats (re: Pegasus), relationships to known pedophiles, very creepy/confusing coded messages in multiple emails across multiple leaks, correlation to previous human trafficking cases, musicians with very questionable content performing at &quot;All Ages&quot; shows starting in the late evening, rumored contents of the AW/HA &quot;laptop&quot;...</p>

<p>Agreed 100%... I&#39;ve been skeptical of numerous things, related to PG and a ton of other conspiracy theories. Do I get attacked for being skeptical? Do I get called a shill for questioning the fringe narrative? Of course, but, I agree with you. The best way to prove anything is to hold ourselves to a higher standard.

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the focus needs to be placed on human trafficking, especially anything related to children... we&#39;re seeing reports of government officials/law enforcement/religious figures being implicated in crimes against children at a blistering pace. Multiple times per week, they are getting caught red handed. Both current and former officials. (I could cite over 100 cases in the last 12 months alone - usually only covered on a local media scale and never revisited after the initial report) </p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming that the speed of these arrests is increasing purely due to the reverse engineering of these sick networks. </p>

<p>Compared to the extremely disturbing history of massive cover-ups related to child trafficking/abuse (Dutroux, Saville, Boys Town, Aquino, Buckingham Palace, Epstein, The Finders, Westminster, Congressional reports of boys in the WH from the 80&#39;s, Afghan/Private Security coverup, Hapstead, etc... the list continues) it begins to make you think... if THIS LIST, which is only a small subset of a much larger list, is being aggressively covered up - why wouldn&#39;t there be a massive, more organized, deeper cover-up that could potentially implicate some of the most powerful people in the world? </p>

<p>Sadly, I&#39;m not sure that leaves much in the way of next steps for us to help with. Aside from giving more coverage and participating in more discussion pertaining to these crimes. </p>

<p>We would need to stumble upon a lead that is not already being pursued by LE officials, and then somehow legally obtain hard evidence and share it with LE. It would probably be a very bad idea to share such information/evidence on unofficial channels first - as it could put the same people we want to protect in harms way and/or give the perpetrators time to flee and cover their tracks. </p>

<p>We should stay vigilant and keep our eyes open. Support our POTUS, support citizen investigators, support each other. There is no denying that these crimes are happening - whether or not the PG implications are true. </p>

<p>Personally? I think we&#39;re going to find links between drug running, gun running, human trafficking, child trafficking, high-end artwork and real estate transactions that will unveil a massive black market/barter system used by the elites to fly under the radar. </p>

<p>I just hope this is exposed sooner rather than later and the hammers all drop simultaneously. Lopping off the heads of the hydra in one shot, denying them the chance to retreat/regroup/double-down on their secrecy efforts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks again, stranger. I have absolutely no doubt that these rings exist, and I am fully committed to seeing them dismantled and the perpetrators punished (and depending on the nature of their particular crimes, preferably rehabilitated where possible - but I acknowledge that this is itself a controversial opinion).</p>

<p>I am mostly interested in how these crimes can be investigated by conspiracy theorists without hurting innocent people (either erroneously targeted or caught in the crossfire). I think it’s safe to say that if Podesta and Alefantis are in fact innocent (and it sounds like you maintain that they very well might be) that they have already been harmed by pizzagate.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly... I&#39;m not maintaining their innocence or their guilt. I suppose that without concrete evidence, they should be presumed innocent. I&#39;m just concerned with the contents of their emails, social media feeds, art work, commentary, and connections to those who have been charged w/ CP and/or leverage references to CP in their public persona. </p>

<p>That said. You seem to be concerned with the persecution of these individuals and the marring of their public image, especially if they are entirely innocent. </p>

<p>So, my suggestion to THEM would be to explain the contents of the communications/imagery in question. The hot tub party? Please explain. The &quot;pizza related handkerchief&quot;? Please explain. The removed artwork of decapitated children? Please explain. Hastert fleeing to a remote island in Japan? Please explain. A &quot;hot dog stand in Hawaii&quot;? Please explain. Death threats to individuals who discovered the Pegasus Museum? Please explain. The details behind the &quot;Pizza PAC&quot;? Please explain. Why a pizza logo contained the exact Pedo insignia within it, was changed within 24 hours of being discovered? Please explain. Why a pizza shop requires a secure log-in page on a hidden section of the website with multiple file repositories? Please explain.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the underlying issue. There could be innocent explanations for all of this. But absolutely none have been offered. For any of it. </p>

<p>Megyn Kelly allowed a quick explanation of why a girl was duct taped to the table @ CPP... but, failed to ask why that same girl was wearing a t-shirt that read &quot;Pizza Slut&quot; in another photo. That seems wildly inappropriate given the context of these questions. </p>

<p>I think that if these are all truly innocent, coincidental things that just &quot;look bad&quot; but aren&#39;t really all that bad, they should be easy enough to explain... no?</p>

<p>And those explanations offered to the public would at least give them a side of the story for people to consider. Right now the speculation has just gone wild. </p>

If Podesta explained that the hot tub email from a grandmother was perfectly ordinary (and I struggle to see anything weird about it - I read ‘entertainment’ as sarcasm) would that really quell doubts in that particular instance?

<p>I don&#39;t think this is necessarily true.

<p>On the ground, knocking on doors, picking up phones, involving law enforcement, getting testimony and networking/crowd sourcing while dealing in nothing but facts.</p>

<p>The issue? His incredibly rigorous process had originally ignored Pizzagate/Pedogate... but is now coming full circle back to the black market of human/child trafficking + dumbo drops. </p>

<p>When someone as disciplined as GW starts to chip away @ PG, even though he was intentionally avoiding it, you need to step back and think &quot;Hmmm... maybe there IS something to this&quot;.</p>

<p>But, to answer your question, we need less armchair internet investigators (myself included) and more crowdsourced/crowd-funded individuals on the ground, talking to real people, uncovering new evidence. </p>

<p>Even if that means a group on the web hires private investigators to tackle specific subjects - such as the deaths related to the DNC case, more detailed background on the relationship to Epstein/Weiner/Clintons, how does Awan connect to human trafficking, looking into those implicated in actively covering up previous investigations, etc... </p>

<p>Only so much can be done from the safety of your monitor. I personally don&#39;t have the time/background to conduct an investigation like GW does - but I would gladly fund said investigation for those who do. </p>

<p>Pizza slices is perfect for money, think about pizza being a denomination, say $1million, and each slice being $100k or something similar.  Hotdog could be illegal contributions, and so on.</p>

<p>Dominoes?  Think about what dominoes might be a metaphor for in terms of setting up polls or something, cheese or pasta could be money vs favors.  I.e. “It is easier to set up rigged polls by promising <em>money</em> rather than <em>favors</em>”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that the phrase is weird it just suggests that they don&#39;t mean food when using the term pizza, so it has another meaning.

    <div class="md"><p>Real conspiracy theorists are skeptical by definition. You should always be skeptical of everything. But you should also always take in as much information from as many sources as humanly possible, and then use this information to form your <em>own</em> opinion of the truth. </p>

<p>I agree that there is no hard, damning evidence that the Podestas and Alefantis are involved in a large human-trafficking ring in DC. But I also believe that the circumstantial evidence surrounding Podesta’s leaked emails and Alefantis’ social media accounts (before they were made private) are enough to warrant suspicion, and to enough for me to conclude that these men are more than likely very sick individuals. </p>

<p>Now, here is my issue with what you’re saying; with the lack of any <em>hard</em> evidence of crimes we are left to make up our own minds about whether or not Podesta and Alefantis are involved in some sinister shit. If one decides that they are not guilty, then everything stops right? If one thinks it’s not likely these incredibly powerful people could be guilty of such horrific acts, then what motivation is there to continue investigating? </p>

<p>Now, if the circumstantial evidences leads you to conclude that Podesta and Alefantis actually ARE into some incredibly nefarious crimes (which is my personal belief), then what happens next? Do I buy a gun and go try to take justice into my own hands? Absolutely fucking not. Only a lunatic would do that. OR someone being paid very well to do it for the purpose of creating a media event so that “normal” people will associate anyone who might believe in pizzagate with this idiot who shot up Comet Ping Pong. In simple terms, to smear conspiracy theorists even more.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about the lack of hard evidence and why it might be that none has been discovered. IF there actually is a DC human-trafficking ring involved in satanic rituals and the rape and murder of children, wouldn’t it be pretty highly likely that the police, judges, district attorneys, and other powerful and influential people would be in on it? Don’t you think the cover up would be massive and involve blackmail and other shady dealings?</p>

<p>My point here is OF COURSE there is no hard evidence of these crimes. If there were such evidence, we would hope that these people would be tried and thrown in jail for the rest of their lives. </p>

<p>The ONLY type of person who is going to “weaponize” this conspiracy are complete lunatics or someone being paid to make people who believe look bad.</p>

<p>So while you’re worrying about offending someone or what people think about you, more children will suffer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly - what the hell can be done without hard evidence? What SHOULD be done? Perhaps we need to start with specific instances of missing/abused children? Or human trafficking rings? I just don’t think that the pizzagate investigation will achieve anything other than potentially harming innocent people, and at best, harming the reputation of monsters. It seems to drive a huge wedge people otherwise likeminded people... that much I know for certain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on your definition of the pizzagate investigation. Does your definition only include Comet Ping Pong and Washington DC? Because I think it’s much much bigger than that, and calling it “pizzagate” is fucking stupid because it makes people who know nothing about it and haven’t researched think that it’s only about one pizza shop in DC. Which is incredibly wrong. The problem is that the thousands of people who have done research and seen the circumstantial evidence that created the conspiracy in the first place are incredibly outnumbered by people who have NOT researched and only know about Pizzagate because some idiot was paid to go to Comet Ping Pong and fire a gun off (for the purpose of discrediting the theories and make all of us look crazy).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks again, stranger. I have absolutely no doubt that these rings exist, and I am fully committed to seeing them dismantled and the perpetrators punished (and depending on the nature of their particular crimes, preferably rehabilitated where possible - but I acknowledge that this is itself a controversial opinion).</p>

<p>I am mostly interested in how these crimes can be investigated by conspiracy theorists without hurting innocent people (either erroneously targeted or caught in the crossfire). I think it’s safe to say that if Podesta and Alefantis are in fact innocent (and it sounds like you maintain that they very well might be) that they have already been harmed by pizzagate. Do you think it’s possible to engage in these civilian investigations without harming innocent people?</p>
