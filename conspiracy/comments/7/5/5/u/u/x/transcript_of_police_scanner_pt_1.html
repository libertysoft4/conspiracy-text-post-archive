    <div class="md"><p>I listened to this about 9am the next day. I remember when I heard someone call over and tell officers to lock their cars because civilians were trying to get in and find gun. I was like holy crap!!! Then came back and took it a step further with civilians were stealing patrol cars to use as medical transportation.  I, too, thought this was a HUGE deal and then never heard it repeated again. Nowhere in any update did I hear someone reference this craziness. </p>

<p>Pretty sure it was that douchebag Dan Bilzerian. He posted a video running from the concert, hiding behind a cop car and getting into it, trying to get a gun and being a general douche. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These scanner transcripts are amazing - cheers for putting in this time dude.</p>

<p>I see this as one of 3 possibilities- </p>

<ul>
<li><ol>
<li>Panic of people running from the shooter and multiple people calling police to report it </li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol>
<li>Diversions called in - police were given multiple areas to investigate to split their forces and distract them, also points to this being a planned op </li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol>
<li>Multiple shooters/accomplices - Mandalay shooter (I also have theories about the Delano) was primary, creating a diversion for other shit to go down elsewhere. Other reports of shooting was that shit going down.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>What I&#39;m really curious about are the reports of active shooters, and people shot at other casinos <em>after</em> Mandalay is reported as breached. If the official narrative is true (lol) then there should have been NO shooting after that breach </p>

<p>Also interesting how scanner audio only records 1 breach. There are 2 reported, however zebra20 comes onto to main channel (after second breach) to report the suspect down... </p>
