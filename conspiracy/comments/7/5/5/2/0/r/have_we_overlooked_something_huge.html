<p>Australian Brian Hodge said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He said police told him the gunman was in the room 32135, just one room away from his hotel room. &quot;I&#39;m room 32134 so I&#39;m just so glad I didn&#39;t make it back to my room,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been assuming this whole time that Paddock rented the adjoining room. This room is where the first shots were fired from!  How the hell did Paddock get in this room to break the window and begin firing?! How is Brian Hodge not being interrogated, if the first shots came from his room?! </p>

<p>Or is he mistaken about his room number?</p>

<p>Or is this guy a pathological liar?</p>

<p>Can we crowd source to see if there are any news articles that definitively say whose name room 134, the adjoining room where the window was broken, was under?</p>

<p>Btw: Here&#39;s visual confirmation that the adjoining room where shots were fired from and the window broken <strong>is</strong> 134:</p>

I don&#39;t know what voltage their batteries are, but they are a weird size and you can get generic ones that size but they suck.

    <div class="md"><p>I think so, too.  There is a picture out there, taken during the shooting, where the window in 134 is clearly seen broken, and 135 is not broken.  Paddock was found dead near the 135 window.  This leads me to think that the picture with only 1 broken window was taken while Paddock was switching rooms and broke the 135 window later in the 11 minute rampage.</p>

<p>This also shows that he was the lone shooter.  I am not convinced that he was the only one involved, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they would not be shooting from the same window at the same time.  I think the first window (134) was used to try to get the fuel tanks and the crowd.  However, the angle on the crowd was obscured by the stage, so as people started to scatter, he wanted to get a better angle.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is that maybe he broke into 134.  At some point, Paddock moved from 134 to 135, but he closed the doors between the rooms.  Perhaps he wanted to prevent the SWAT from breaking into 134 and coming in from the side.  </p>

<p>While you are correct that there may have been a second person, and they were taking turns shooting, I just find it hard to believe.  If they wanted to cause max mayhem, they would have shot at the same time.  I think alot of what was heard were echoes.  </p>

<p>All these weird conspiracies aside (shooters in the crowd, coverup at the Bellagio, etc, etc), the only thing that anyone SAW was shooting coming from the 32nd floor.  What people thought they heard is up to each individual.  </p>
