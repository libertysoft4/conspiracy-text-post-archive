        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In fact, I&#39;ve been seen numerous times discussing 9/11 with y&#39;all, but that&#39;s neither here nor there.   From the start of this Las Vegas thing I knew something was fucky.</p>

<p>A little background on me.   I&#39;m a 38 year old Iraq war veteran.   I was there for the invasion in 03, and was part of the lead element for most of the push to Baghdad.  I got to visit such lovely places as An Najaf, Karbala, Baghdad, Abu Ghraib and Fallujah.  So yes...I have a wee bit of experience when it comes to incoming gunfire and what it sounds like.   </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been around firearms my whole life.  My old man was 20 years infantry and retired in 95, so I consult with him on things as well.   </p>

<p>I generally don&#39;t believe in conspiracy theories.   I leave that to my brother.  No believe in Occam&#39;s Razor, where the simplest answer is often the right one.  I don&#39;t listen to the media, but rather draw my own conclusions based on evidence available an my own extensive experience with the government and life in general.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;ve found myself deeply questioning the official story of what happened in Vegas.   Too much shit don&#39;t add up.   Too many glaring inconsistencies, especially to folk experienced with firearms of both the semi and fully automatic variety (it bears mentioning I was my platoon&#39;s M-249 SAW gunner).   </p>

<p>So here I am...siding with who I once fought against.   But, as the saying goes, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.   So on this, we&#39;ll work together, exchange information and try to get to the bottom of this mass clusterfuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To a large extent you are correct. Are there really no answers, though? During my time in &#39;conspiracy&#39; I have learned a lot about human behaviour and &#39;crowd psychology&#39;. For instance, I found out about Gustave le Bon (who is the father of crowd psychology) and read his book &#39;The Crowd&#39;. Fascinating insights into how humans work.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://imgur.com/8gQsUF4">one example</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;A crowd scarcely distinguishes between the subjective and the objective. It accepts as real the images evoked in its mind, though they most often have only a very distant relation with the observed fact.&quot; -Gustave le Bon</p>

<p>I now feel like I have some <strong>answers</strong> as to why seemingly-intelligent people are incapable of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-bmS1aResY">seeing the obvious</a>.</p>

<p>My personal feeling is that engaging with ad hominem comments with people that are new to this conspiracy world casts us in a similar light as the MSM and I try to be very cautious about attacking the messenger.

<p>Except real mercenaries get better equipment, <strong><em>much</em></strong> better pay, and far more interesting jobs.  The majority of the military is simply junior enlisted being told what to do.  You probably know more about why they&#39;re doing a thing than they do.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the warriors fault.   That&#39;s the fault of the brass who&#39;s several thousand miles away from the battlefield, has no idea how combat works, and is in an air conditioned office and gets to go home and bang his wife at the end of the day.  Those of us with actual boots on the ground are just pawns in a large and very expensive game of chess.</p>

<p>Not at the moment, but there may come a time when you&#39;ll be glad there&#39;s a bunch of cranky, decrepit combat veterans around who are more than willing to lace their boots back up, pick up a rifle and defend your rights for you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given that most, if not all of the mics we hear in the videos are cell phones or GoPros, it&#39;s a safe bet that mics are pretty standard and low quality.   Also, it&#39;s not just the sound, it&#39;s also the rate of fire.   Generally weapons firing 5.56 have a higher rate of fire than their larger caliber brethren.  A fancy mic isn&#39;t going to change the cyclic fire rate.</p>

<p>If it was a automatic 5.56 you would be correct. A bump stock equipped 5.56 doesnt have a set rate of fire. Go watch any number of videos they all have different rates of fire based on how quickly the shoot rocks the weapon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have, and I think this is just anither incidence of people processing a tragedy by attempting to attribute greater meaning to it...same with Sandy Hook. Frankly there is nothing inconsistent, or even surprising at this point, about a lone nut killing tons of people. Given the methods and weapons he employed, the outcome was predictable. There are tons of eyewitness videos, all consistent with the official story; no multiple shooters are required, and nobody has a motive to cover anything up.</p>

<p>The idea that all these shootings are attempts to help gun control legislation is hogwash, because <strong>these shootings never lead to gun legislation</strong>. Most of us who want sanity in our laws have basically surrendered to the reality that it just isn&#39;t going to happen. We live in a country with a lot of people, some of whom own a lot of guns and some of whom are mentally sick, and it turns out those two groups have a little overlap. Don&#39;t be shocked by any of this.</p>

<p>Think about it: whatever the political aftermath, is there really anything that odd, in a country as full of guns as ours and with so many people, that a handful of people are going to go off the deep end and use those guns to commit mass slaughter? It should come as no surprise at this point. It happens regularly.</p>

As with any chaotic scenario with thousands of people, scared shirtless, running for their lives,  and officers not experienced in urban combat or being on the receiving end of automatic gunfire, there&#39;s going to be a lot of confusion and a lot of false reports.   Unfortunately, in that situation, officers can&#39;t afford to ignore anything potentially dangerous, so their senses are on full alert and what was actually a door slamming or trash can falling over could easily be construed as gunfire to the overwhelmed mind.</p>

Also in the &quot;Ultimate AR-15 Meltdown&quot; vid just casually asking, as again coming from a pretty low key gun owner nation, how many people are this well set up in the US as in able to simply bang thru 1000&#39;s of rounds and destroy an admittedly sponsored gun but still and the clips and drum mags and his general set up indicates this is quite the hobby/past time for some a&#39; y&#39;all folks over there! </p>

<p>I&#39;d be happy with a scatter gun, long rifle and a side arm but alas we cain&#39;t do sheeeit fire arms wise over here. I understand many people simply collect them as they are a form of currency and hold their value well as well as the obvious use if TSHTF.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked over this - seems there is a gun called Ultimax 100. Uses the same ammunition as an AR-15 but with the fire rate that is consistent in the videos (10/sec).  That is interesting.  I felt an M240 would have done way more damage.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From watching the Russian guy put a few belts thru an M240 above I cannot believe it was an M240 used either. It would have been devastating and there would have been observable wide spread damage to structures/toilet blocks/other buildings etc..., holes in the ground, cars, people with missing limbs and huge exit wounds. </p>

<p>I would imagine at least one or two videos would have far more footage of projectiles/real time impact evidence if an M240 was used also?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  The rpm is the only thing I&#39;ve seen that connects to M240 so far.  Would like to know more about the shooters technique.  I heard he didn&#39;t change clips but moved from one gun to the next instead of reloading time.  However that doesn&#39;t support the long pauses between shots.  I&#39;m also curious about ballistics with the gun/victims.  We know they were legally purchased but were any scratched for illegal resale? So many questions and a lot of crap to sift through.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couple of questions I have:
1) in the videos towards the end of all the gun fire you here 2 pistol gun shots within 30 seconds of each other.  I am assuming one was him killing himself.   But wouldn&#39;t the gun shot be muffled if he put the gun to his head? 
2) who or what was he shooting at with the 1st pistol shot?</p>

<p>The best video for the gunshots come from the bus station video in front of the Mandalay Bay (3:40). After those 2 gunshots you don&#39;t hear any more.</p>

<p>One last question: have you seen any video of gun shots hitting anything? I heard sounds but no visible debris from gun shots.  I also haven&#39;t seen any bullet holes outside the fuel tanks.  Have you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The gas feedback system in the AR rifle system is actually pretty simple.  There&#39;s a small hole in the barrel.   Attached to that hole is a tube that runs back along the gun and into the upper receiver.   A small amount of the gas used to push the bullet out of the barrel is redirected back down the gas tube to push the bolt carrier group back and cycle the weapon.   Does that make sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it does thanks a lot. It&#39;s quite simple. </p>

<p>So the gas causes the rounds to cycle? </p>

<p>What else about the AR platform makes it so popular in the US? Are they hardy like AKs in terms of reliability under rough usage?</p>

<p>We have them over here too and I think they&#39;re quite popular for their ability to be modded but only in semi. obviously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.   A lil bit of gas is recycled to push the bolt back to eject the spent casing and pluck a new round from the magazine.</p>

<p>ARs are popular because you can pretty much do anything with em.   They&#39;re the Chevy small block of the gun world.   Leave it stock and it&#39;ll do whatever you need it to.  Or you can spend thousands of dollars on upgrades to make it more accurate, easier to shoot, more stable, even fire larger rounds.   It&#39;s a very versatile weapon system.   </p>

<p>I got one due to the fact I&#39;m very familiar and proficient with the platform from my time in the military.   I don&#39;t have a lot of bells and whistles on mine, simply because I don&#39;t need them.   I&#39;m comfortable with the bare bones weapon and can shoot very well with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firing full auto from a standing position is exhausting.   The gun beats the shit out of your shoulder, all the while trying to climb and twist your body in the direction of the poor shoulder you choose to bludgeon with the butt of the gun.   So you&#39;ve gotta control muzzle rise as well as twisting forces on your body.   With a small round like the .223/5.56mm it may seem easy enough since the AR doesn&#39;t have bad recoil at all, but during rapid fire everything is multiplied, and it becomes more difficult the more rounds you send down range.</p>

<p>&quot;Many of the most critically wounded patients arrived at the 541-bed University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, the state’s only Level One trauma center. Over about four hours, it received 104 patients. More than 80 percent were gunshot victims.&quot; (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/as-the-wounded-kept-coming-hospitals-dealt-with-injuries-rarely-seen-in-the-us/2017/10/03/06210b86-a883-11e7-b3aa-c0e2e1d41e38_story.html">Source</a>)</p>

<p>That&#39;s more than 200 right there, at only two hospitals, and not including victims who were taken straight to the morgue. I&#39;d guess the gunshot victim count will be ~250. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting reaction.  </p>

<p>Sometimes it takes something to happen that you have expertise in to question what is being presented as &#39;nothing but the truth&#39; and with a completely straight face.  Who knows, maybe journos and TV heads are highly ignorant. </p>

<p>Your attitude and reactions (which you admit, previous and apart only to this incident) are really puzzling to some of us who have considered something else regarding various &#39;theories&#39;.  Even after theories are acknowledged and have become common knowledge, it seems ppl can&#39;t wrap their mind around the fact of that such insidious manipulation can be happening.  </p>

<p>I hope more ppl like you, with military training, connections and integrity will begin to realize what is really happening with the trillions of $ and lives being casually burned by the nebulous tptb.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too many questions, not enough answers.   </p>

<ul>
<li>why all the guns?   Two would&#39;ve been sufficient for this type of operation.   Everything else just complicates things further.</li>
</ul>

<p>-why have explosives if you&#39;re not going to use em?</p>

<p>-how the hell is an out-of-shape retiree gonna have the physical stamina to fire that many rounds?   Believe it or not, firing automatic weapons for any amount of time with any sort of accuracy is difficult and rather painful.</p>

<p>-why did he just off himself when police approached?   Clearly he came ready for a war.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>he fired for around 10 minutes, his hotel room wasn&#39;t breached for nearly an hour after he stopped shooting....what was going on in that room during that time?</p></li>
<li><p>why is the FBI so heavily invested in a case that clearly falls under local law enforcement jurisdiction?  If this guy had no ties to anyone else, then it&#39;s a lone gunman and belongs to the LVPD.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>-how does a person fall <em>underneath</em> a gun on a bipod after shooting himself in the nugget?   Typically headshots result in an instant collapse and just kinda crumple to the floor, but this guy was laying perfectly supine, almost as if moved there, and a rifle sat down over his foot as an afterthought.</p>

<ul>
<li>where is the fucking video?   I understand this is an ongoing investigation, but considering the scale of things, how about some footage of him in the hotel hallway setting up the nanny cam in the room service cart?</li>
</ul>

<p>For that matter....</p>

<p>-how long is a high rated hotel on the Las Vegas strip gonna leave a room service cart in the hallway?   Those are typically policed up pretty damn quick, last I knew.   My wife worked housekeeping in a small casino hotel here in Southwest Michigan, and they monitored CCTV and were told when a room service cart was left for longer than 5 minutes.</p>

<p>-why was there so much confusion around how many guns were found?   Seems like a pretty straightforward thing...count the guns, make a note of the amount, and go about your business.  That number shouldn&#39;t have fluctuated so damn much.</p>

<p>-thousands of rounds fired....four dozen shell casings.  I&#39;ve fired automatic weapons on the range.   On one memorable occasion I cooked through over 4,000 rounds with my M249 SAW.   The mess was considerable.  </p>

<p>And lastly</p>

<ul>
<li>if he did enough research to have a dope sheet (ranges, bullet drop, compensation rates, etc), why wasn&#39;t he aware of shooting in short bursts to maintain accuracy?   Machine gunners are taught 3-5 second bursts by literally saying &quot;squeeze and release&quot; out loud while performing those tasks.   It&#39;s a method to maintain accuracy while still pouring hot death down range.   Had this guy practiced that method, the kill count would&#39;ve been a lot higher.   Instead, he just went gonzo on the bang switch and relied on accuracy by volume.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few things that irk me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes sense.   But I don&#39;t agree with it being a 240 simple due to the amount of devastation a 240 will lay down, even at that range.   If someone was using a 240, the body count would&#39;ve been astronomical and the injuries would&#39;ve been gruesome.</p>

<p>There are numerous other weapons that have a cyclic rate of fire around 600rpm.   The AK-47 jumps quickly to mind.   In fact, in most of the videos I saw (and many of my veteran friends agreed) distinctly sounded like AK47 fire.   And god knows I&#39;ve been on the receiving end of AK fire enough to be familiar with the sound.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not familiar with any 5.56/.223 weapons that fire at less than 800rpm, but I&#39;m not a weapons expert.   I have heard of multiple people being treated for .223 bullet wounds, and haven&#39;t heard anything about any different calibers, which definitely interests me.   </p>

<p>If anyone could do a ELI5 breakdown on the mechanics and gas feature of an AR-15 I&#39;d be much obliged coming from in comparison to the US relatively gun free NZ. Also in the &quot;Ultimate AR-15 Meltdown&quot; vid just casually asking, as again coming from a pretty low key gun owner nation, how many people are this well set up in the US as in able to simply bang thru 1000&#39;s of rounds and destroy an admittedly sponsored gun but still and the clips and drum mags and his general set up indicates this is quite the hobby/past time for some a&#39; y&#39;all folks over there! </p>

<p>I&#39;d be happy with a scatter gun, long rifle and a side arm but alas we cain&#39;t do sheeeit fire arms wise over here. I understand many people simply collect them as they are a form of currency and hold their value well as well as the obvious use if TSHTF.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes sense.   But I don&#39;t agree with it being a 240 simple due to the amount of devastation a 240 will lay down, even at that range.   If someone was using a 240, the body count would&#39;ve been astronomical and the injuries would&#39;ve been gruesome.</p>

<p>There are numerous other weapons that have a cyclic rate of fire around 600rpm.   The AK-47 jumps quickly to mind.   In fact, in most of the videos I saw (and many of my veteran friends agreed) distinctly sounded like AK47 fire.   And god knows I&#39;ve been on the receiving end of AK fire enough to be familiar with the sound.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not familiar with any 5.56/.223 weapons that fire at less than 800rpm, but I&#39;m not a weapons expert.   I have heard of multiple people being treated for .223 bullet wounds, and haven&#39;t heard anything about any different calibers, which definitely interests me.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.   A lil bit of gas is recycled to push the bolt back to eject the spent casing and pluck a new round from the magazine.</p>

<p>ARs are popular because you can pretty much do anything with em.   They&#39;re the Chevy small block of the gun world.   Leave it stock and it&#39;ll do whatever you need it to.  Or you can spend thousands of dollars on upgrades to make it more accurate, easier to shoot, more stable, even fire larger rounds.   It&#39;s a very versatile weapon system.   </p>

<p>I got one due to the fact I&#39;m very familiar and proficient with the platform from my time in the military.   I don&#39;t have a lot of bells and whistles on mine, simply because I don&#39;t need them.   I&#39;m comfortable with the bare bones weapon and can shoot very well with it.</p>
