<ul>
<li>firstly we got told that there was nothing there </li>
<li>secondly we got told that there was a piece of paper there but it &#39;wasn&#39;t&#39; a suicide note.</li>
<li>thirdly we then get told that its a bunch of numbers to calibrate said guns to fire upon crowd correctly...</li>
</ul>

<p>then this article just got posted.. not too long ago.. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4959970/Vegas-prostitute-says-Stephen-Paddock-enjoyed-violent-sex.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4959970/Vegas-prostitute-says-Stephen-Paddock-enjoyed-violent-sex.html</a></p>

<p>Quote from article &#39;&#39;In Paddock&#39;s room, officials found a piece of paper containing a number of phone numbers but they reiterated no suicide note was found.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>So which is it? are they trying to float around trying to find one specific story that &#39;fits&#39; comfortably with the majority or am I missing something here?</p>

He didn&#39;t need to aim because it was a dense crowd If people. All he had to do was knock out a window. Aim in the general direction and sweep his weapon. Upon reload he&#39;d just start in a slightly different spot... maybe a foot or so from where he started before. This isn&#39;t rocket science. The rounds will travel until something stops them or they lose velocity and drop. He literally had to do nothing more than point and shoot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  The rebuttals are stretched, and disconnected from reality, but sure.</p>

<p>Have you ever tried to fire entire magazines from &quot;bumpstocks&quot;, while sticking to calculations?  Hint:  After the first round, calculations fly...  out the window.  And after the first reload, getting back to &quot;calculated&quot; shooting is unnecessary and time consuming.</p>

<p>Even with a machine gun (more likely), the same principles apply.  After the first couple rounds, you&#39;re walking it in, not aiming individual rounds.</p>

<p>What you called my &quot;absolute conclusions&quot; aren&#39;t absolute at all.  It&#39;s reasonable speculation, based on audio/video evidence, assuming the one-shooter scenario.  If it was one guy, it was an idiot, who fired off several warning shots before he really opened up.  He also had only one primary weapon, based on the ridiculous delays in firing.  If he was using all of those prop bumpstocks, he would&#39;ve just swapped out right away, for a jam.</p>

In a tightly packed crowd aim down and wave the gun back and forth while firing. Reload aim down in slightly different direction rinse and repeat. He didn&#39;t need to aim or sight anything. He couldn&#39;t miss. If he had one particular person or a small group of people sure... he&#39;d have to be more focused in his aim. But all he really had to do was point and shoot. Thankfully he WASNT aiming expertly or more people would be dead.</p>

<p>ive not said he used a range card with a bumpstock and i dont know if the authorities have.</p>

<p>i am as sure as i can be that he never expected people to just stand there. i would expect he expected everyone to run, scatter, try to find cover. its fair to assume he expected to have to aim at targets. when they didnt, that is when he realised he could just go full auto the whole time and didnt need to aim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You started the guessing game.  And your guesses don&#39;t even match the video evidence, or the rationale of a person &quot;calculating&quot; for maximum effectiveness.</p>

<p>What you called my &quot;absolute conclusions&quot; aren&#39;t absolute at all.  It&#39;s reasonable speculation, based on audio/video evidence, assuming the one-shooter scenario.  If it was one guy, it was an idiot, who fired off several warning shots before he really opened up.  He also had only one primary weapon, based on the ridiculous delays in firing.  If he was using all of those prop bumpstocks, he would&#39;ve just swapped out right away, for a jam.</p>

<p>If it was multiple shooters &quot;handing off&quot;, then the entire note discussion is completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>How does that push the gun control agenda? To me it just makes it look like guns are hard to use without the proper training.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to me there was something he HAD to hit hence the scope. Tannerite/thermite &quot;painted&quot; fuel tanks? For the crowd... jaysus that&#39;s not rocket science. In a tightly packed crowd aim down and wave the gun back and forth while firing. Reload aim down in slightly different direction rinse and repeat. He didn&#39;t need to aim or sight anything. He couldn&#39;t miss. If he had one particular person or a small group of people sure... he&#39;d have to be more focused in his aim. But all he really had to do was point and shoot. Thankfully he WASNT aiming expertly or more people would be dead.</p>

<p>The idea that he used a range card with a bump stock... pretty sure most people familiar with that would LOL no.</p>
