<p>ALBUM- <a href="https://imgur.com/a/xLSi2">https://imgur.com/a/xLSi2</a></p>

<p>First some backstory on how I found this location and possibly give it some validity on what I think it is. While browsing Google Mars as I do from time to time looking for anomalies I remembered theory of Valles Marineris being an impact site of some kind. Then it struct me, if anything were to survive such a impact it would have to be on the complete opposite side to stand a chance. So I go to the other side of the planet and by luck I land on the spot. It immediately stuck out like a sore thumb and I could tell from quite a distance this was different. Then there it was a pyramid weather natural or unnatural It is almost perfect and the shadow is very telling. there seem to be three of them differing sizes but in almost the same arrangement as the Great Pyramids. The largest most telling one is quite large about 4x as big as the Great Pyramid. I would really like to know if they line up with Orion but I&#39;m not sure how to figure that out. This alone was quite intriguing but even without these the surrounding area is very anomalous. Im not going into detail as you can see for yourself. Another thing to keep in mind is the scale of these things as the are massive. This would make sense however if you take into account the CIA remote viewing documents. The viewer was explaining how massive the structures and building were. Whether or not this has anything to do with it I don&#39;t know I just thought it was interesting. Another thing is that the area was photographed in high resolution but has no labeling in or around the area. You would think that this would be labeled as it is different then any of the landscape on mars. We have all seen pictures of apparent &quot;structures&quot; or anomalies on mars but really nothing has ever really been convincing to me. This however has really got me intrigued as I have never seen anything like this. Now this could all be natural and just coincidental that I happen to come across it. Let me know what you think! And please use the coordinates from the images to check it out your self if you have the ability. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not image artifacts, just erosion.  You can see that there are many flat features in the area.  These are probably made of harder stone with softer stone or debris under them.  As the softer material wears away underneath, the harder layer can tilt with edges suddenly rising up into peaks.  Now, view such a formation from above with a strong light from the side, and you can see very pyramid like formations.  </p>

<p>FWIW i would love to see something on Mars, but in this case i think its too easily explained and better evidence is needed.</p>

<p>Las Vegas false flag was so poorly executed it alone will bring down the crooks who think they control us.  I don&#39;t think you realize how many people out there know the truth since you&#39;re just hanging out in one of the most shill-infested areas on the internet.

    <div class="md"><p>Relevant:</p>

<p>The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope. They tried to trick a psychic by making the location Mars and the time a Million years ago. This is the result. <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf">https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf</a></p>

<p>The Mars coordinates the CIA psychic was asked to focus on (in the newly declassified reports) are less than 10km away from &quot;The Face on Mars&quot;, and Google Mars has a strange chatbot there.</p>

<p>The Mars coordinates the psychic is first asked to focus on are 40.89 degrees north, 9.55 degrees west.</p>

<p>Here is what it looks like on Google Earth (Mars): <a href="http://imgur.com/a/TL4m9">http://imgur.com/a/TL4m9</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA was interviewing a self-proclaimed psychic. He was given an envelope containing a time (1million BC) and a location (on Mars). The interviewee in unaware that he is talking about mars. The only people aware of the contents of the envelope are those conducting the interview.</p>

<p>He was not told the location or time, he was only given the geographic coordinate, and he was asked to envision the location at the time given in the envelope. He goes on to describe geological structures that we see on mars in present day, and remnants of a civilization. They ask him to go further back in time where the civilization still existed, and he describes tall, thin figures wearing strange clothes.</p>

<p>At the end of the interview, the tall dark figures appear to be in some sort of trouble. He interacts with them and reports that he thinks they perceive him as a hallucination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the CIA was using various methods to create psychics or boost the signal and abilities of people who demonstrated the ability to tap in. </p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is that these &quot;martians&quot; are not little green men, but fit exactly the description of the giant beings from the sky seen in ancient hieroglyphs. </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that these were one of the exploration groups or the exploration group sent to find a new home. </p>

<p>Some believe they were not able to, or refused to go back to Mars, so they set up shop here and helped advance civilization greatly, essentially viewed as Gods. </p>

<p>Since that time, earth has had many mass extinction events, it&#39;s possible the martians eventually died off, as there were not enough of them to reproduce effectively. Some believe they were eventually able to blast off and explore other planets. </p>

<p>If you were on Mars and going off planet, where would you go first? Earth of course, it&#39;s what would have happened after that which is speculation but someone somewhere has the answers as these stories, even these fossils of giant beings are likely secured somewhere. </p>

<p>The pyramids might have been built on earth for the same reason they were built on Mars according to this session, as the only thing strong enough to shield you from massive storms and geological events. They may have been ordered built by the martians as preventative maintenance knowing what happened to their own planet. </p>

Still though. Theories and speculation about life and civilizations on Mars have been around since at least the 18th century? A con artist could have potentially memorized a coordinate range for Earth, maybe specific countries, and even for Mars as well. I prefer that the experience was genuine though.  Also, has anyone looked up these coordinates to see if this info checks out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mars was hit with the same genetic materials as earth was, the very same recipe was sent to both planets. </p>

<p>There are a few theories, some of the more reasonable ones are that Mars was able to accelerate life far faster than here and were far ahead of us, but also burnt out ahead of us. </p>

<p>Whether they became interplanetary or were simply a highly advanced civilization that saw it&#39;s end where it started is up for debate. Also, even if they could get to Earth, it&#39;s possible our atmosphere at the time would not have been hospitable to them and they would have gone elsewhere. </p>

<p>With all the technology we discover, it&#39;s insane to think that similar life forms with a million plus year head start would not be flying around the universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The universe consists of the same base ingredients, mars, because of it&#39;s proximity to earth was hit by the same amounts of materials the earth was, the difference is Mars was just a little too close to the sun, so it cooked everything faster, and burnt out faster.

Again, mars being smaller would mean shorter core lifespan, no core no magnetosphere no atmosphere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There a Graham Hancock book called &#39;The Mars Mystery&#39;, very interesting read. </p>

<p>What everyone has to remember about trying to find evidence of civilisation on Mars, is that that planet got hit by something so powerful that it blew about a third of its crust straight off. If there were oceans on the planet, which it seems more and more likely there were, they would have completely destroyed <strong>everything</strong> on the surface as Mars&#39;s lithosphere cracked and the oceans washed around the planet.</p>

<p>What I would expect a planet to look like after that happening is exactly what Mars looks like. Dried debris absolutely everywhere, evidence of water erosion, and <em>any potential structures almost complete covered by flood debris and sediment</em>. </p>

<p>Still though.  Theories and speculation about life and civilizations on Mars have been around since at least the 18th century?  A con artist could have potentially memorized a coordinate range for Earth, maybe specific countries, and even for Mars as well.</p>

<p>I prefer that the experience was genuine though.</p>
