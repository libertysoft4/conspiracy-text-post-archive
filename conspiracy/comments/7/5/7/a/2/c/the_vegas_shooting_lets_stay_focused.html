        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I love the dedication and effort that this sub has put in to trying to uncover the truth. This is a legitimately growing on people outside of this community, and the average people are highly suspicious of it. Given that, I think it’s important that we focus on asking the important questions (because it’s still so early on), rather than passing off rash conclusions.</p>

<p>Here are some of the most significant questions I have, and that I think we should be asking:</p>

<p>-Why is the story regarding the note changing? First it was suicide, then trajectories, then phone numbers? Why is the story so inconsistent? </p>

<p>-Why were there so many eyewitness accounts of multiple shooters, such as people claiming shooters at other casinos, or witnesses at Mandalay saying moments after that there were multiple gunmen?</p>

<p>-Why did Paddock have so many weapons? Understandable to bring extras in case of overheating or jams, but 19 guns for one person is excessive. </p>

<p>-What was the motive for a retired, wealthy man, with no history of mental illness, to try mass murder hundreds of people? </p>

<p>-What evidence exists to suggest he had an escape plan, and if so, why didn’t he activate it?</p>

<p>Please add any legitimate questions, I know I’m missing a bunch. </p>

<p>And finally, when talking to people who aren’t from this Conspiracy community, let’s make sure we do more asking then theorizing and drawing conclusions (at this state). I’m all for getting the theories out here on this sub, but asking valid and unanswered questions is a better strategy for persuading and spreading curiosity to the average person.</p>

<p>What information do they have on the shootings at other locations that night?</p>

<p>What caliber rounds have been pulled from victims? </p>

<p>What do the entry/exit wounds look like in regards to trajectory angle and distance?</p>

<p>Why did the Aussie claim to have room 134? </p>

<p>Why did Paddock&#39;s former neighbor in Mesquite, NV call into a radio show to explain he was certain he was not of the demeanor to do something like this? (caller was a Marine who saw combat)</p>

<p>Why is there audio evidence showing different shot patterns occuring simultaneously? (that puts a hole in the echo theories)</p>

<p>Did any major thefts occur at any casinos that night? (Casinos would not report this publicly if so I would imagine, you don&#39;t want repeats)</p>

<p>Why was the window in the suite broken out at least 3 minutes (police response time) <em>after</em> the first shots were fired?</p>

<p>Why was the connecting door locked to 134, when that window was where the first shots from Mandalay were fired? </p>

<p>What the fuck happened to the security guard and where is he?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First 2 volleys not from the Mandalay is interesting... I&#39;ve seen some information that alludes to the Delano being another site- (reports of a van tearing out of the Delano during the shooting) (no full automatic weapon reported in the room - but the sound seems to be coming from the same direction, in some videos) (reports of shots fired from the Delano) </p>

<p>Taking it with a grain of salt of course, but I&#39;m considering the multiple shooters theory (not necessarily at the same time- but some different weapons for sure) </p>

<p>It&#39;s a theory in progress, however I&#39;m more interested in just trying to analyze facts - as few as they are (basically what we know vs what we don&#39;t know) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s interesting even further to me about the 2 volleys from a separate location is that NYT interview from the guest in 31134 combined with the pictures showing the suite window not being tampered with until at least 3 minutes following the first shots. If the guest thought they were fireworks at first, until the third volley, being extremely loud and having debris hit his window below.. where were the first 2 volleys? They ask him a leading question &#39;so the first 2 volleys came from the suite?&#39; and his response was &quot;yeah, yeah&quot; - doublespeak type shit.. like the person being interviewed decided that was the easiest answer to give rather than &#39;well....&#39; - keep digging for the truth, I&#39;m right there with you. </p>
