        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Picture of room(s): </p>

<p><a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/10/04/las-vegas-shooting-room/1efe262ee3bbd8034eeb19826b7a23651ee63cc2/room-diagram-1050.jpg">https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/10/04/las-vegas-shooting-room/1efe262ee3bbd8034eeb19826b7a23651ee63cc2/room-diagram-1050.jpg</a></p>

<p>From this point forward, I will refer to the windows as left and right.</p>

<p>The narrative is that the left window was smashed open to shoot at the jet fuel tanks at the airport.  </p>

<p>Two things with that.....</p>

<ol>
<li>How many hammers were found in the room(s)?</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe only one.  The hammer has been shown near the supposed killer in the leaked photos.  The narrative says that the windows were busted open by a hammer.  </p>

<p>Where the hammer is, right in front of the right window, one would believe that the right window was the second of the two to be smashed open. </p>

<p>The first shots were directed at the crowd since videos have shown the crowd rolling out after the hint of the first shots.  So it would seem that the first shots came from the window with the best trajectory for the crowd, the right one.  But yet, that is where the hammer was located. </p>

<p>One can say, well the windows were smashed open before the shooting began.  This leads me to point two.</p>

<ol>
<li> If the windows were smashed open before the shooting began, then you would think that pre-planning would want to look at the most efficient windows to smash.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>How much time is wasted going from one window to the next as they were chosen?  Why smash the left window where it was?   </p>

<p>You could still get the same view 6-8 windows to the left of the right blown-out window.  Plus, all the guns can stay close together.</p>

<p>The locations of the windows that were smashed out just don&#39;t make any sense.  That is unless........</p>

<p>All shooting was actually taking place from the left window and somehow Paddock was framed to be the shooter and the second window was smashed open after the shooting took place.</p>

<p>But in this case, while the shooting was taking place, why would Paddock be in his room and not want to flee?  I am going to rule out that he was being held unwilling, because if the shooter had the team to hold him against his will, then the right window would have been blown out earlier.  So maybe he was being told to stay in the room by someone that could seem trustworthy.......someone, oh I don&#39;t know, like a security guard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is correct. If you watch the video once again, the video pans away from the door connecting the two rooms.  It was to the right of the TV. </p>

<p>The question is is the door between the rooms the location of the &quot;second breach&quot; or was it the door to the master bedroom?  If it was the door between the rooms, then that would MAKE ZERO SINCE since Paddock supposedly shot out of both windows according to the narrative and would have needed the door open between the two.</p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely correct. Not a single fucking thing about any of this makes any sense. I think the reason it doesn&#39;t make sense, is because we&#39;ve all been fed a line of bullshit.</p>

<p>Personally, I think there were more suspects, but they got away, and it&#39;s easier for them to feed us bullshit than face the backlash for letting an unknown suspect get away. The outrage would be off the charts if they had to admit that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, very similar overall.  However with that narrative, the shooter already has access to the suite and would have been shooting from the right window as it has a better view of the crowd and there would be no need to bust open the second window where it was. I am claiming similar but saying all shooting came from the left window, otherwise why choose the windows as is?  Maybe the second room was not ordered by Paddock, but could have been by someone with access to make it look like Paddock did?  An unbeknownst to him, they were setting him up right next door.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With this originally posted theory...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why reserve two rooms?
It may be possible that Paddock didn&#39;t reserve the second room.  It is possible that someone had access to his player&#39;s card or wallet.  Until we see reception desk security footage, this is still a possibility.</p>

<p>Why smash out two windows?
That is exactly my question and the choice in windows leads me to believe that the shooting came from the other room.
If the shooter(s) had smashed out the furthest window in the left corner in the main suite that would&#39;ve given them a similar vantage point to the window in the adjoining room.
This is why I question the windows chosen.  However, after originally misreading your statement here, I looked at the photo <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-las-vegas-shooting-live-updates-why-did-it-take-police-so-long-to-1507174474-htmlstory.html">here</a> once again.  It could be possible that the main suite window location was chosen to have a direct line of sight into the second room.  Why would this be needed?  To communicate with and be in unison with a second shooter possibly?  Not sure.</p>

<p>The only reason to book another room and smash out that 2nd window is if there were two shooters.
Or as stated before, it was a set up to make it look like Paddock had access to both windows from the start.  I am trying to claim that he possibly didn&#39;t know of what was going on in the adjoining room leading up to the event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if that is the floor plan, how hard would it have been to take out part of the wall and escape into the stairwell? Not saying that was the plan or is what happened, but I recall something in the press conference about one of the bedroom doors being locked. A hole in the wall would certainly be evidence he planned on escaping, or perhaps that someone did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is completely possible. It makes little sense why either door would have been locked. I think at the point of the press conference there is a lot of conflicting information. I think we all just want a clear picture. Not sure if we will ever get close though. </p>
