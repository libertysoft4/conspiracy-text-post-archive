        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I work in a very busy restaurant in a very busy town in the North-Texas area. I overhear guests&#39; conversations all throughout my day/night, each and every single shift. I drop eaves like any other indrustry worker does, and tonight I overheard several conversations regarding Las Vegas. Even in this area, which is rather affluent and very &quot;status quo&quot;, if you will; people are starting to question the whole thing.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying what I think happened or embracing or endorsing any current theory. I&#39;m merely pointing out that even regular, clueless and purposefully-ignorant people of America are now starting to ask the real questions. Who? What? Where? When? Why?</p>

<p>Conspiracy or no conspiracy, the only question that really matters in this entire thing is the video footage  from the hotel&#39;s (likely) hundreds of cameras. Where is it? Why hasn&#39;t it been shown? Who has it? Who is in it? When was it filmed?A five-second clip would appease most folks, and they&#39;d have just enough proof to place blame, forget and move on to the next distraction. Yet, here we are: seven days after the event and we&#39;re no closer to any real facts than we were seven days ago. </p>

<p>Call it what you will, but this one isn&#39;t sitting right with the people and they don&#39;t fully buy what they&#39;re being sold. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right on with you&#39;re overall statement.  Unlike ever before, people are really questioning if they&#39;re being lead to the truth.  Even those who seem unable to be woke, are getting roused it seems like.  This is the main evidence in my opinion, that whatever took place was not the intended plan and/or, TPTB or those with prior knowledge of the attack lost control of it at some point or another, now having to play damage control while redirecting the narrative.  Whatever happened that caused it to run loose was so unexpected, so out of their realm of possibility, that it left them speechless and in obvious conflict, in regards to the best direction to spin the story without waking the masses to any underlying schemes.  </p>

<p>With that in mind, it comes off as rushed and unpolished.  9/11 for example, had some flaws and red flags the public questioned, but the damage control was Swift and thorough enough that the majority of the population was able to accept the official story so they could move on to mourning then onto revenge.  The holes in the LV Massacre appear to be too large with too many unanswered questions and too much visible confusion among authorities for the majority of the public to know the who what when and wheres.  Without being force fed the outlining facts, the lack of an official narrative that makes even a little sense, is causing those who normally accept it to be reality and move on with life, not being able to move on and leaving them finally questioning why their government is having trouble fabricating an acceptable reality for them.  Some are even questioning why their gov is fabricating anything in the first place!</p>

<p>Call me naive, but this is starting to look like the first GENUINE sign of a majority awakening.  If this isn&#39;t enough to tip the scales, one more jostle, maybe even a small one, will be enough to make the aforementioned a reality</p>

What is weird to me is the police scanner has shots fired on floor 32, 29, middle of the hotel, and a few floors up on the hotel. Were the police wrong each time about all these other shots?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My initial reaction was basically &quot;what really happened, is this a pretext for war and loss of rights?&quot; I still believed literal passenger planes  crashed and took down the buildings that way. Then almost immediately they started pinning it on Osama Bin Laden even though the official story is most hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. So we invaded Afghanistan and Iraq. Huh?</p>

<p>I had a flight out of the country that month and saw dying children on TV from our bombs. I&#39;m guessing the news didn&#39;t cover that in the US.</p>

<p>Curiously enough in the prior months some activists were campaigning against the Taliban and their abuse of women. Their real crime in the eyes of the empire was destroying poppy fields and disobeying their former CIA paymasters. Saddam Hussein was a monster but his real crime in their eyes was similar, acting tough against oil companies and spending money on his own people. Iraq had years of embargoes since the gulf war and we deliberately destroyed infrastructure over and over again. Without water treatment plants and chlorine hundreds of thousands of people died from disease and dehydration. My country invaded and murdered all in the name of freedom. A supposed three thousand Americans dying is horrific and tragic, a mass genocide over decades is also horrific.</p>

<p>Out of interest, how much do you trust what you see on the TV? George Orwell wrote about how even war is faked on the telescreen. Ever since I read <em>1984</em> I have wondered just how far the lies go...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent question. Instead of believing or disbelieving I weigh probabilities. Like alien overlords is less than 1% and pizzagate 99%+ in my estimate. I try to hold multiple scenarios in my head without getting too locked in. There are so many possibilities. Even trustworthy people lie sometimes and everyone gets stuff wrong. History is a series of half truths, cultural erasure and lies of ommision. </p>

<p>So the TV? I am inclined to believe when people say bad things about themselves or those close to them. Other accusations are more tricky. I try my best to parse the information, read between the lines, and check conflicting sources. It&#39;s never all lies or all truth on the news. It&#39;s infotainment designed to channel energy into useless shopping and giving up on each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read that theory on here a couple days ago.  Thats a strong theory.  If he was a patsy, I think that&#39;s exactly how it went down.  I think the theory was that maybe they loaded the guns into his room while he was gambling, then the security guard told him someone broke into his room and he needed to go to the room with him.  Then shot him, then started the rampage.</p>

<p>The frustrating thing is that this can all be found out pretty easily with the security footage, but then again so could the Pentagon &quot;plane&quot; controversy.  I think its very fair to say that if the American people don&#39;t get to see the security footage of him that week, of which there&#39;s probably hours and hours of footage, then we have every reason to believe this was a false flag.  </p>

Every day more and more &quot;evidence&quot; creates a narrative that makes less and less sense. Stephen paddock could have shot and killed all those people. Whether he did or not is important but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the media is lying, the LVMPD are lying, and the FBI is hiding something. This goes beyond &quot;active investigation cant release certain info&quot; bullshit. </p>

<p>They flat out contradict themselves in the same press conference. &quot;We breached the door&quot; and &quot;the door was ajar&quot; are two completely different accounts of what&#39;s going on.

    <div class="md"><p>This. I experienced this the other day with another user who was convinced the Boston Marathon bombing was a hoax. When I said I know people directly affected in the bombing, he immediately shut me down and called new a liar. At that point it becomes crystal clear how biased and delusional certain people are, and how underlying they are to question the narrative they subscribe to. I&#39;m not saying that the BM bombing wasn&#39;t a false flag, or that certain aspects of it weren&#39;t staged, but to say nobody was killed or injured is blatantly false. That kind of reaction alienates all the people who knew/know someone affected by those tragedies, and those are people with access to some of the best intel, so there&#39;s little value in driving them away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to ask yourself if there is any possible way you could ever be convinced that people actually got hurt and were killed, is there any evidence that would change your mind? Because if there isn&#39;t, then you are completely biased, you&#39;re compromised and your ability to think critically is severely hampered. People who are so adamant no one died ask for pictures and video, demand it, and then when they&#39;re shown video and pictures they say it was faked, so there&#39;s actually no way of ever proving to you it really happened. So there&#39;s no point in you engaging in any discussion with anyone about it.</p>

We share that footage with him and he says it could be crisis actors, that they&#39;d only need 100 actors to fake being shot. I point out that more than 100 people were taken to hospitals with gunshot wounds. He asks for a source, I provide a credible source with specific statistics proving that there were more than 100 gunshot victims admitted to hospitals. Now he wants to see video footage of all 100+ people actually being shot. That&#39;s when I give up. Because you know that it you provide that footage, they&#39;ll reject that too, since they&#39;re only seeing what they want to see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so I have replied a couple of times to you. I admit I’ve called you an idiot. But here’s the thing, I DO know first hand of a person who was killed. The reality of that has shaken me to my core. I cannot say I was there, but the way that it has affect me, and other folks is very real. Nothing you say can change that for me. </p>

<p>That said, I do believe that in some way for some reason that this was a false flag operation. The two things that stick out for me are :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Jesus Campos</p></li>
<li><p>Absence of any video surveillance footage. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I can’t come up with a single unifying theory of what happened, but I do believe we need to keep asking questions and putting pressure on the media and law enforcement to get us something that makes sense. </p>

<p>In a court of law, the burden of proof is on the accuser(s). You are making the accusation of a hoax. It’s up to you to PROVE IT  with sources and credible evidence. </p>

<p>Just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The burden of proof is on the original claim, which is that there was a bloody and large-scale massacre, and while we&#39;ve seen the usual snippets of scenes which suggest this, we haven&#39;t seen anything that couldn&#39;t be easily faked. And, there is a lack of the abundant visual confirmation we would have. </p>

<p>People also like to say, &quot;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.&quot; Well the idea of so many people being shot and wounded is an extraordinary claim that has yet to be backed by even reasonable evidence, let alone extraordinary evidence. </p>

<p>People like you have said they know someone, and though I don&#39;t know you some of them even seen trustworthy. But, I have had probably at least ten people tell me they know someone who died, which leads me to believe that at least some of them are lying.</p>

<p>The truth is, if it were a real shooting there would be no need to appeal to these inside connections because we would have plenty of objective evidence and reason to think real deaths occurred. I would change my mind if I saw the true manifestation of bullet damage and carnage there should be. </p>

<p>Of course, there is indeed evidence that it is a staged drill, since this is what is appears to be under scrutiny. </p>

<p><a href="https://aim4truth.org/2017/10/04/analyzing-the-mandalay-massacre-false-flag/">https://aim4truth.org/2017/10/04/analyzing-the-mandalay-massacre-false-flag/</a></p>

<p>Who is Jesus Campos? I haven&#39;t heard that yet. </p>

<p>I think we can mostly agree that Paddock did not do it, and if there were in fact a real shooting then it sounds like at least two different shooting locations. </p>

<p>So if they would lie about who did it, I am hesitant to give the benefit of the doubt that the whole thing isn&#39;t staged and fake. It would certainly be less hassle and headache, and far less danger, for the perpetrators to keep it fake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a hard time thinking that hotel staff would unknowingly do that.</p>

<p>In 2009 on the last day of my vacation in Las Vegas, we checked out of our hotel but then went to the buffet for lunch at the Paris. My friends and I checked our luggage with the bellmen outside of the Paris, and about 90 minutes later we returned to pick it up. They had opened up my backpack and removed the battery from my laptop. I was kind of pissed and they told me it was a security precaution.</p>

<p>If they were doing that 8 years ago to a bag that didn&#39;t get further that the door to a hotel, they&#39;d at least unzip or unlatch a giant bag or case that was going up to a room in the hotel and check to see what was inside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can someone explain to me why investigators would (or should) be compelled at this time to release these videos? Suppose it variously shows him bringing up his own suitcases or getting help in bringing them up.  Investigators would be focused on proper acquisition of the videos, establishing chain of custody, reviewing the videos, looking to see if he talked with anyone, and following up on any leads that the videos might suggest.  </p>

<p>My thinking is that if there were multiple people involved, then sure, there could be a &quot;cover up&quot; in not releasing the videos.  But if he was acting mostly alone on this <em>during his stay at the hotel</em>, then there really wouldn&#39;t be any reason for the investigative team to release the videos so soon.  I mean, it&#39;s not particularly odd that they aren&#39;t releasing them, is it?</p>

<p>This is an honest question.  Would be glad to be proven wrong here, thanks.</p>

<p>All those other attacks you mentioned had much much smaller investigations and alot less unanswered questions so you can&#39;t reall compare them to this, their motives were known pretty much instantly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how big events like this come out. People are jacked on adrenaline and tell a version of the story, they come down from the adrenaline high and remember details.  Ever been in a car crash?  It&#39;s the same thing. Things happen fast in the moment but you remember details later in slow motion. And getting all these version of events together (when some are being leaked to press and some we&#39;re hearing about later) is a big chore, especially since people remember things differently from each other or are just wrong about details (if you&#39;ve never been in a war zone or been a cop, you&#39;re not likely to know where shots are coming from when they&#39;re 400 yards away unless he used tracer rounders, which he didn&#39;t.)</p>

<p>Maybe the security office noticed the remote smoke alarm (from the barrel smoke) and notified police at the same time as a guard doing a random walk around also heard shots from the room. Only later do they realize they were both happening at the same time.   </p>

<p>I wish people would stop thinking they&#39;ve figured out some hidden master plan-- mostly life is just shitty random events.  A crazy old dude snapped and brought a bunch of guns to kill a bunch of people. Maybe he was on drugs or maybe he was mentally ill like his dad who was on the FBI&#39;s most wanted list or maybe he was mad about life and wanted to go out in a blaze of glory. Apparently, during the LA riots he got on top of an apartment building he owned, ready to shoot people if they tried to loot the building, so maybe this was his fantasy for a while? I don&#39;t know exactly why he snapped, but everything I&#39;ve seen points to this guy being a lone psycho.  </p>

Think Forrest Gump when you think of this place. Anyhow, I service air conditioners , and when I meet my clients and begin to talk to them we have a lot in common. Most of my clients are retired air Force folks. Average age is 70. They all know how the internet works and use a computer. Shit they even have Netflix. I tell them to get on Reddit conspiracy page and read. I also tell them too watch loose change or zeitgeist. Some of these old timers are woke as fuck. Half of them smell like weed. You know the media divides us all up. Black, white, gay , religious , agnostic, old, millennial , north, south , east , west. It&#39;s sad. We could change shit if we talked more.</p>

I mean, &quot;Lone Wolf psychopath Fires down on crowd&quot; sounds a whole lot better for gun advocates than &quot;3 Gun-crazed lunatics organize crowd shooting&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why have we seen other odd surveillance coverage of (I think) Trop but nothing for MB?
I worked in gaming for 12 years as a casino auditor. In one of my audits, we surveilled a prost/jackpot ticket ring. The idea that the hotel did not have working cameras is serious bs. Someone slips and falls, beats their woman, breaks into a room...it&#39;s essential for liability purposes. Plus, they are required to test gaming and no gaming coverage for the Gaming Commission. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how you cannot question the story. Just this piece of it for example.</p>

<p>A note was left. We&#39;re told it&#39;s not a suicide note.
We&#39;re told that it&#39;s calculations of trajectory. 
Now told that it was actually phone numbers.</p>

<p>This leads me to believe that (assuming the new info is true) 
They found a note
(702) 555-5555
or 
702 555-5555
or some variation there of</p>

<p>and decided at that point that the most logical explanation of and 7 or 10 number is bullet trajectory and not a phone number. I thought that the easier answer is always the assumed answer until proven otherwise.</p>

<p>The FBI and Las Vegas department should be ashamed of themselves throughout this whole ordeal. The evidence of a coverup is slapping people in the face because they are not trying to hide it... and why should they? You saw what happened with the FBI and Killery. &quot;Anyone else would have broken the law...&quot; &quot;She did not commit a crime&quot;. Get the fuck out of here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I remember correctly for the Boston bombing we had footage from people who had filmed it on the street right after but security camera footage of the actual guys leaving the bags in the crowd and the seeing them run off before it explodes was not released to the public until much later.  </p>

<p>If we had had clear security camera footage of the Boston bombers mere days after the attack like you claim there wouldn&#39;t have been that whole mess with reddit where everyone was trying to identify the culprits through pictures.  I seem to remember that going on for a while.</p>

<p>Could we not assume the same thing is happening now? Currently we have a lot of footage just from random people on the street.  Maybe the security camera footage will be released later?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. I experienced this the other day with another user who was convinced the Boston Marathon bombing was a hoax. When I said I know people directly affected in the bombing, he immediately shut me down and called new a liar. At that point it becomes crystal clear how biased and delusional certain people are, and how underlying they are to question the narrative they subscribe to. I&#39;m not saying that the BM bombing wasn&#39;t a false flag, or that certain aspects of it weren&#39;t staged, but to say nobody was killed or injured is blatantly false. That kind of reaction alienates all the people who knew/know someone affected by those tragedies, and those are people with access to some of the best intel, so there&#39;s little value in driving them away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t buy into many conspiracies. I don&#39;t think oswald did it. There are a few oddities from 9/11. Other than that I don&#39;t generally indulge into it to much. But this is different. Monday morning I heard about what happened. After the first few news reports I could tell something was off. Every day more and more &quot;evidence&quot; creates a narrative that makes less and less sense. Stephen paddock could have shot and killed all those people. Whether he did or not is important but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the media is lying, the LVMPD are lying, and the FBI is hiding something. This goes beyond &quot;active investigation cant release certain info&quot; bullshit. </p>

<p>They flat out contradict themselves in the same press conference. &quot;We breached the door&quot; and &quot;the door was ajar&quot; are two completely different accounts of what&#39;s going on. Both said by Sheriff Lombardo in the same press conference. There&#39;s plenty more inconsistencies with him and with paddocks brother. The whole think is horseshit and the people aren&#39;t buying it.</p>
