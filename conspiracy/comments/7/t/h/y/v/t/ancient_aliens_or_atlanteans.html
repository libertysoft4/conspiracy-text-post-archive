We know that these cultures shared the same gods and deities, or at least had comparable gods.
We know these distant cultures shared the same architecture and building styles as exemplified in Ollotantambo and Giza.</p>

<p>Personally, it frustrates me to see these topics, which warrant serious research, get diluted and joked down to the theory that &quot;aliens did it&quot;.</p>

<p>Which is easier to believe? 
Aliens came from God knows where to this planet of all planets to teach savages how to live because they apparantly had nothing better to do being capable of interstellar travel?<br/>
Or that an ancient, advanced human civilization travelled the world trying to civilize it again after it was destroyed?</p>

<p>The former, for the cult of $cience (ie. the space fanboys who cream their pants at anything to do with Holly Wood science fiction - because anything contradictory to Darwinian Evolution is just... Not science, bruh!!).</p>

<p>Truth is, humans have been on this planet for millions of years, and evolution is complete and utter bullshit. The geological evidence of the pyramids and the Great Sphinx, contradict this theory, so... it&#39;s hush, hush, don&#39;t talk about it. The evidence shows, that all are in the range of 10k to 200k years old. This would mean, there was a pre-Deluge civilization, at least...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Proven theoretical frameworks” thats an oxymoron. You can not prove a theory. If you prove a theory it automatically become a fact ie: undeniable truth meaning there is no debate. Also %99 proven? %99 of what? Also wouldn’t the %1 automatically discredit your evolution as fact? </p>

<p>Also your question is so moronic and narrow minded. What worldview is %100 proven? Is that even possible? How do you even prove a worldview. Also Is evolution even a worldview? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just trying to jostle some thought in you homie. Your worldview is rife with contradictions so I&#39;m just trying to help you out here. But I&#39;ll give you an example.</p>

<p>Using some advanced calculus to determine how far a baseball will fly and where it will land by calculating its a velocity, initial location, angle of trajectory, wind-speed, spin, and air density will predict its flight pattern with something akin to 99% accuracy.</p>

<p>Thats a framework based upon a theory, that has strong predictive power. My question was if you would completely reject that framework and theory even if it predicted the correct result with 99.99% accuracy?</p>

<p>Under your worldview there are no facts. You are basically a relativist with zero grounding for approximating or determining truth. </p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong about that you should explain how you deterimine what is a fact. You should also explain how you would evaluate one theory as better than another. </p>

<p>If you have no way of making such evaluations or determinations you have to grounds to criticize more sophisticated thinkers who&#39;s frameworks provide actual predictive power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some scientists now asking that evolution be taught as one theory--and not treated with religious fervor as if it&#39;s set in stone. They&#39;d like to be able to discuss other ideas like morphic resonance, cosmic ancestry, or punctuaed equilibrium. Evolution hasn&#39;t been so gradual. It has happened, in the grand scheme of things, in geological time spans. </p>

<p>I tell people I know when creation occurred, if they want to look at it that way. It&#39;s called the Cambrian Explosion. The evidence is clearly in the fossil record. We go from simple tube worms to every phyla now in existence appearing pretty suddenly in the fossil record. </p>

<p>Modern accepted evidence indicates a minimum of 200,000 and the truth is likely much closer to the realm of 500,000-1,000,000.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You couldn&#39;t be more wrong about me. I&#39;m literally the opposite of your insults. You are a shit judge of character.</p>

<p>If you did the research you claim to be interested in you would understand the creation story.  I&#39;ll give you a short version. Enki mixed his DNA with a hominid to create us to be slaves. His brother Enlil despised us and did try to exterminate humans on multiple occasions. Enki considered human as his &quot;children&quot; and saved humans from Enlil&#39;s orders to kill is all. After the attempt to kill us by flood it sunk several islands including Atlantis. From there they moved to Egypt and set up a new civilization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know Sitchin&#39;s stories, which get increasingly more elaborate to explain every hole that forms in it.  This makes as much sense as the fundamentalist interpretations of the Bible.
You&#39;re operating under the assumption that Earth and it&#39;s people are somehow important enough to a civilization capable of reaching millions of planets that have larger deposits of gold than Earth does.  That&#39;s anthropocentricism, as is most of Sitchin&#39;s work.  As if we&#39;re somehow that special.</p>

<p>The comet theory for the deluge is the most likely one, and I still fail to understand how Sitchin doesn&#39;t see how andeluvian humanity would be capable of genetic engineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I literally said we were made to be SLAVES. Where in your mind are you conjuring up the idea that I think mankind is special? </p>

<p>Your understanding is flawed. I don&#39;t think a version of modern man even existed before they came here. It wasn&#39;t until Enki mixed his DNA with a hominids that a modern version of man was created. How can I believe we are special because they chose this planet if humans didn&#39;t even exist before their arrival?</p>

<p>You have absolutely no idea where gold or mineral deposits are in the universe. Perhaps earth was the  closest planet that  had a similar  atmosphere and gravity, that&#39;s why earth was  chosen.  Who knows? </p>

<p>The tablets he translated can be put to the test with any computer. His work has been verified by many researchers. I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s perfect and got everything right but he did enough to get everyone started investigating the work on their own.  Of course errors will be made doing this type of research. But that doesn&#39;t discredit everything because a few things are wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I didnt.  I created a post criticizing the media&#39;s insistence, often in ways that are deceptive and disengenuous, that human orgins are wholely alien.  Instead of both our theories seriously being seriously scrutinised we are thrown on second rate propo.  I was watching an ancient alien program when I posted it.  It would have made you cringe too.</p>

<p>That&#39;s your right man, and if it provides you peace that&#39;s fine, but I&#39;m not going to go along with it.  What I said Sitchin wont account for.  Also, we can hint at mineral composition due to the atmospheric study of exo-planets.
It is also a xenophobic claim due to it jumping to a hostile frame of reference concerning aliens (who were more likely from this planet).</p>

<p>You need to remember that these were comparatively primitive people in scope of knowledge to &quot;The Annunaki&quot;.  To them, they would have been alien, and that&#39;s even more suspect considering the Sumerians copied these texts from stories that were aeons older.  </p>

<p>Im not afraid of different cultures. I&#39;m fascinated by them and love experiencing different things.. I&#39;m accountable for myself and that&#39;s it.

<p>Yes I believe the DNA manipulation story. I also believe that there is no separation at all in the universe. All is one and all is void. More of a Buddhist way of life.</p>

<p>Im smart enough to know that I know nothing and there is no absolute truth.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of them copying texts. What culture did they get them  from?Canu link me something about that please?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I look at it, if they are that advanced, it&#39;s probably no different than us going out into nature and seeing wild animals. When we go out into the wilderness, not all of us go to kill things. Sometimes we are just curious and want to look. I remember having a bear come up to just a couple of feet from our tent when we were camping once. It was an awesome sight, but also scary. He left us alone and walked off, but no way were we going to challenge or mess with that wild animal, even though we could have easily shot him. We ignored him and he left. And even hunters will go out to find something, but they don&#39;t try to kill everything in sight. We might seem so primitive to them that they don&#39;t worry about us being any kind of challenge or threat to them. The same way we consider a herd of deer or rabbits interesting, but no threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well said. I understand what you intended to imply however I would follow with cows here on Earth. Rarely do cows threaten humans and generally could be considered a close zoological relative to your deer example.</p>

<p>Yet we kill ~7-10 million of these udderly ;) benevolent creatures.</p>

<p>Also many creatures we see and even Crows of the bird kind play social games. And since anything below quantum level is unknowable magic it could be that you and I are actually grey aliens or reptiles in some kind of memory wiped virtual reality training sim, or hyper sleep, etc from a dimension with a completely different but still logical and physically consistent working of spacetime basically meaning it really is the matrix. Maybe its a free will sim like Civ or Sim games.</p>

<p>Again the point being there are hundreds of theories and it is by definition an attribute of a post singularity civilization to be incapable of us to reason technical abilities let alone any form of subjective, cultural, or medical purpose.</p>

Some of the drawings that were made of those people were odd looking from our vantage point. Flat and pointed looking. Not larger than our craniums, like some of the elongated skulls. So that points me in the direction of them being born that way instead of head binding. And the thing is, we&#39;re moving modern humans back further and further.

</blockquote>

<p>If I am understanding right, you are assuming that someone who believes in ancient aliens is more difficult to control than someone who believes in God.  Many people who believe in God follow certain moral principles like the 10 Commandments.  People who don&#39;t believe in God and believe in ancient aliens do not inherently have a set of moral principles by believing in ancient aliens.  Where do they then get these moral principles from?  I say more often than someone that believes in God, they get them from the State.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Some people are already pretty much religiously devoted to the State in that they believe whatever the State tells them.  Public education is controlled by the State.</p>

<p>While religious beliefs have been manipulated through various means, texts like the books in the Bible have been well preserved.  I am of the belief that the texts are held to be so important by followers that it is difficult to make alterations to them.  So I similarly disagree with your last point about brainwashing people into becoming religiously devoted to the State being more difficult than manipulating existing religious beliefs.  I would even say that the way that they manipulate religious beliefs is to make them more religiously devoted to the State.</p>

<p>For me personally, I was an atheist/agnostic/Buddhist for most of my life.</p>

<p>I never in a million years ever thought I would be Christian. Ever.</p>

<p>Then I studied it on my own. I did not listen to what people told me.</p>

<p>On March 21, 2016 I had an experience with the holy spirit after praying to Jesus. Nobody has to believe me.</p>

<p>But seek and you shall find. It is your choice if you want to start the journey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;ve seen that link before when discussing the same matter, but it simply deals with the moral implications of believing that either one of them are prophets, but not the factual basis for their claimed miracles.</p>

<p>But at least you&#39;ve finally answered that you don&#39;t believe Muhammed&#39;s miraculous claims,  even though they have the same amount of evidence for them, so that&#39;s settled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Bill Cooper, a highly esteemed researcher within the conspiracy community, Joseph Smith was a Freemason:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s funny that you mention that the Mormons have condemned Freemasonry when they carry out the exact same rituals that are carried out in a Masonic Lodge in their temple ceremonies, and most Mormons are indeed, as was Joseph Smith, members of the Masonic Lodge. Our research shows that the public statements of the Mormon Church are often, and I mean often, contradictory to their beliefs in what they truly practice in their daily lives and within the temple. They are, in fact, a secret society, a secret organization that practices the same rights as the Masonic Lodge within their temple and have the same goal, and that is that the practitioners of the religion of the Mormon Church will, in fact, become god. That is, of course, what the other secret societies, and we&#39;re talking right now the Freemasons. They&#39;re really all are the same organization. They&#39;re working toward becoming god.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read the myth, too. Although there is evidence it&#39;s more than a myth. There are also ancient myths of humans living before we had a moon at all. Although I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s possible, because the moon affects our tides, which deposits life from the sea on the shores at high tide and is pretty important to the life cycle.  Some astronomers posited there was a second moon at one time a few years ago. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2011/08/03/earth-once-had-second-moon-astronomers-say.html">http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2011/08/03/earth-once-had-second-moon-astronomers-say.html</a></p>

<p>One thing I found interesting, also, was finding out a Mars sized planet did hit our young earth amidships at just the right angle to knock a poisonous (to our life) atmosphere off the planet and helped create the atmosphere we have now.

    <div class="md"><p>I live my life as if there is some grand purpose to the pain and chaos of here, you know like discovering some information system that changes the human condition and creating amazing child processes from this base but also recognize and knowing full well in my heart there is zero purpose. </p>

<p>It’s something of a coping mechanism which we are in most cases typically better left to ignore but maybe counterbalance that to our greatest strength, idk.</p>

<p>So as part of my imaginary meaning making  coping mechanism and existence over a world view where real true gold genuine individual purpose exists I like to pretend on a day in day out down basis all the way down to the very moment level of occupying some shared slice of spacetime with other foreign objects that are not my immediate self that producing good, positive, or otherwise creative and trasmutative output will eventually at some point (most likely long after my flame has sparked out) matter to some one or thing that will for the slightest span of time, appreciate or otherwise admire the conscious beauty of our mostly complete shitshow of reality in here in this Universe B World C.</p>

<p>As an even further extension of this part cartoonist, part naturalist magical fairytale coping model universe I produce and update as a daily habit, I also append some sort of notion that these rare ephemeral chunks of cool feels will ultimately go on to produce even more impactful good vibes down the spiral.</p>

<p>And at another point long dark down in the abyss of this place, some badge wearing entity much higher pay grade than I will notice this program of good has created some non noise value of better stuff deep into this recursive branch of the spiral and want to take a look at the whole system.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I continue to create this universe. </p>

<p>No matter what <em>they</em> and <em>this</em> end up being there is no reward so don’t let them win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>when it comes to ancient &quot;aliens&quot; my opinion is this.</p>

<p>genetically we&#39;ve been modern humans for a very very long time and i think it is utterly absurd to think that it took us until the beginning of recorded history to begin the sort of advancement that lead to the exponential rise of &quot;technology&quot;</p>

<p>i think &quot;civilization&quot; is many many times older than we think. im talking 100,000 years or more, and that we had reached at least the level of the late 1800&#39;s at least once before.</p>

<p>if we have been around that long the need for aliens to explain some of the items that have been found disappears.</p>

<p>now i dont rule out that we may have had contact some time over that period (multiple or extended contact included) but i think the assumption that it had to be aliens really sells the human race short.</p>

<p>so many cultures creation myths seem to center around the idea of multiple ages (or iterations) of man, that its foolish to totally discount them.</p>

<p>it would surprise me if in 100 we havent found out that these stories were talking about neanderthal and other primitive hominids  that we had contact and actual interactions with in the distant past and that those species were actually far more advanced than we currently give them credit for.</p>

<p>the stories of the old gods, may just have been a more advanced species of human, that ended up wiping themselves out fighting with each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modern humans have been around a lot longer. I read an article today of a modern human found in a cave in Israel that was around 120,000 or 130,000 years old. They keep moving the time back further and further as they find more evidence to support it. And I&#39;m not talking about apes like Lucy. Some scientists believe she may have been nothing more than a bipedal ape--not an actual ancestor. Have you ever wondered if there were pre-Adamite civilizations, as some people call them?

    <div class="md"><p>Homo sapiens, as according to mainstream science, speciated between 250,000 and 300,000 thousand years ago. We found fossils in Morocco dated 300k years ago that have been attributed to homo sapiens, and one genetic Adam dated 250,000 years ago. Humans started using language 50,000-150,000 years ago, and started permanently settling 25,000-30,000 years ago. Or so goes the narrative. If we started using language 200,000 years ago, I feel like an advanced ancient civilization could have existed in prior to when mainstream anthropology suggests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love wondering about this kind of stuff, because just the past several thousand years, and especially the last couple hundred, are concrete proof of how quickly (especially in geologic timescales) human technological advancement can occur.</p>

<p>All I really know is based off videos and things I&#39;ve read, so I&#39;m far from an expert. But I think what&#39;s pretty much required for any kind of civilization to form is ez food, from agriculture and/or domestication. I think using genetic analysis, comparing the genomes of food crops to their plant ancestors, and looking for differences in the accrual of random silent mutations can give a rough but accurate timeline.</p>

<p>But I wonder about ancient civilizations and crops that are no longer, and have since gone extinct -- like if there was a lost era of agriculture, based around algae, moss, aquatic plants, or something of the sort. Without evidence it&#39;s all just a fanfic in my head, but I love to think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simple fact is that human society is limited by cognition and usable cultural trends, i.e. things that work get replicated. What are some of the most awe inspiring natural wonders that seem to touch the heavens? Mountains. What do mountains look like? Pyramids. Whats easier, building a regular, four sided structure (pyramid) or trying to actually replicate all the features of a mountain? While its true that many (western) societies contained similar mythologies, its spurious to think that they all derive from a common source. I was a firm believer in ancient aliens/&quot;atlantean&quot; pre classical civilizations as drivers of world culture before I actually went to school and got my archaeology and anthropology degrees. Unfortunately the evidence just isnt there, which isn&#39;t to say that there couldn&#39;t have been somewhat advanced civilizations in the roughly 100.000 years since we developed sufficiently anatomically modern brains, just that so far we haven&#39;t found any traces, and given the extreme time period, its unlikely we ever will. </p>

<p>TL;DR the easiest thing to believe is that humans are remarkably predictable given similar circumstances and, driven by the advents of agriculture, happened to advance along similar pathways as they were the ones that worked</p>

<p>3 Therefore the Lord said, My spirit shall not always [e]strive with man, because he is but flesh, and his days shall be an [f]hundred and twenty years.</p>

<p>4 There were [g]giants in the earth in those days: yea, and after that the sons of God came unto the daughters of men, and they had borne them children, these were mighty men, which in old time were men of [h]renown.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>And after that my grandfather Enoch took hold of me by my hand and raised me up, and said unto me: &#39;Go, for I have asked the Lord of Spirits as touching this commotion on the earth. 10. And He said unto me: &quot;Because of their unrighteousness their judgement has been determined upon and shall not be withheld by Me for ever. Because of the sorceries which they have searched out and learnt, the earth and those who dwell upon it shall be destroyed.&quot; 11. And these--they have no place of repentance for ever, because they have shown them what was hidden, and they are the damned: but as for thee, my son, the Lord of Spirits knows that thou art pure, and guiltless of this reproach concerning the secrets.</p></li>
<li><p>And on that day Michael answered Raphael and said: &#39;The power of the spirit transports and makes me to tremble because of the severity of the judgement of the secrets, the judgement of the angels: who can endure the severe judgement which has been executed, and before which they melt away?&#39; 3. And Michael answered again, and said to Raphael: &#39;Who is he whose heart is not softened concerning it, and whose reins are not troubled by this word of judgement (that) has gone forth upon them because of those who have thus led them out?&#39; </p></li>

<p>Id like to see anybody today build Ollotantabmo or the Pyramids or Teotihuaca, or shit even the building sized slabs of perfectly cut rocks Giza is built on top of.  In any case, even if you&#39;re correct that irs possible it only shows that they had equivalent technology to us, which only raises more questions.</p>

<p>The natives themselves admitted that structures such as the aforementioned and Stonehenge, as it turns out, were built by the gods of former ages.</p>

<p>As far as my statements being vague is concerned, I&#39;d suggest reading up.  The same megalithic architecture exists in Meso America, Egypt, Turkey, and even Easter Island.  Architecture we cannot build today without modern tools.  It&#39;s too precise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those texts are commonly used to claim the Pyramids were the work of Khufu, which makes no logistical or chronological sense.  Khufu likely restored them.  There is evidence for a great project being undertaken during Khufu&#39;s reign.  Set aside the fact that the timeframe of his reign would have made the building of the Pyramids an impossibility, this one person&#39;s notebook would literally be the only evidence for the building of the Pyramids.  You&#39;ll find no Egyptian hieroglyphs nor a pictorial account of their building.  Why? Because it&#39;s likely they didn&#39;t build them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well said. I understand what you intended to imply however I would follow with cows here on Earth. Rarely do cows threaten humans and generally could be considered a close zoological relative to your deer example.</p>

<p>Yet we kill ~7-10 million of these udderly ;) benevolent creatures.</p>

<p>Also many creatures we see and even Crows of the bird kind play social games. And since anything below quantum level is unknowable magic it could be that you and I are actually grey aliens or reptiles in some kind of memory wiped virtual reality training sim, or hyper sleep, etc from a dimension with a completely different but still logical and physically consistent working of spacetime basically meaning it really is the matrix. Maybe its a free will sim like Civ or Sim games.</p>

<p>Again the point being there are hundreds of theories and it is by definition an attribute of a post singularity civilization to be incapable of us to reason technical abilities let alone any form of subjective, cultural, or medical purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homo sapiens, as according to mainstream science, speciated between 250,000 and 300,000 thousand years ago. We found fossils in Morocco dated 300k years ago that have been attributed to homo sapiens, and one genetic Adam dated 250,000 years ago. Humans started using language 50,000-150,000 years ago, and started permanently settling 25,000-30,000 years ago. Or so goes the narrative. If we started using language 200,000 years ago, I feel like an advanced ancient civilization could have existed in prior to when mainstream anthropology suggests.</p>
