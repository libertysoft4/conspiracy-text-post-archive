<p>The danger I feel is in identifying users as related to the domain they spam, how can you be sure it&#39;s an employee of zerohedge or whatever?</p>

<p>Could also lead to false flags eg people spamming msnbc links to purposefully get the domain banned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think banning direct links to sources that pay to shill makes more sense than playing wack-a-mole with users and alts. If the sources don&#39;t have click data and revenue streams, it takes a lot the motivation to pay shills away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I doubt there are any large corporate groups paying users to push their content on this sub, maybe, but I doubt it.  Second, how are we going to prove it anyways, just because a user tends to post from a specific source we should ban the source?  You are going to end up with situations like r/news who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1lecql/the_russian_news_site_rtcom_has_been_banned_from/">banned RT for this exact reason with little to no evidence</a>.  Also, trolls could frame up that source by creating sockpuppets and acting like a overt shill.  The last point is, r/politics knowingly allowed that to happen in my opinion and my guess is there was a falling out between the mods and shareblue which resulted in this &#39;new discovery&#39;.  It&#39;s a heavy handed way of dealing with a situation I don&#39;t think is happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I agree, but this post and the conversation I&#39;m desperately trying to have with you is about banning specific sources that shills are trying to push on this sub, which I don&#39;t think is happening and if they are, they&#39;re doing a shit job of it.  I actually think they were also buy votes in order to push their content on the front page of r/politics to get more attention.  But none of which has to do with this sub&#39;s content and sources, yet you seem to think it&#39;s happening here and we need to start censoring specific sources.  Can you give me a source you see being pushed onto the front page of r/conspiracy?  Or maybe some users you think that are paid to push specific sources in this sub?  <strong>AND I&#39;M NOT TALKING ABOUT SHILL/TROLL HERE TO PUSH AN AGENDA, BUT ARE HERE TO PUSH CONTENT FOR A SPECIFIC SOURCE</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That I can get behind and do anyway now that it has become a habit to use the bot. </p>

<p>But, do you feel like we need our Rule 3 to be reworded to include the type of shilling that happened in r/pol?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I think that would be a good idea. Would be very hard to enforce as you would need proof. </p>

<p>I would like to see direct links to articles banned. That is all the media wants from people. Clicks. Force archive links. Also add contest mode. </p>

<p>Do those two things, this sub would not be worth the hassle for them shills </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for cutting off direct links, but I hate the idea of silencing folks that can&#39;t archive for whatever their reasoning is. I know that archiving is hit or miss for me depending on whether I can get a decent connection sometimes. Others just don&#39;t know how. Dunno. </p>

<p>Anyway, someone in the thread about r/pol mentioned that they thought we needed a rule similar to r/pol&#39;s and I really agree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I agree, but this post and the conversation I&#39;m desperately trying to have with you is about banning specific sources that shills are trying to push on this sub, which I don&#39;t think is happening and if they are, they&#39;re doing a shit job of it.  I actually think they were also buy votes in order to push their content on the front page of r/politics to get more attention.  But none of which has to do with this sub&#39;s content and sources, yet you seem to think it&#39;s happening here and we need to start censoring specific sources.  Can you give me a source you see being pushed onto the front page of r/conspiracy?  Or maybe some users you think that are paid to push specific sources in this sub?  <strong>AND I&#39;M NOT TALKING ABOUT SHILL/TROLL HERE TO PUSH AN AGENDA, BUT ARE HERE TO PUSH CONTENT FOR A SPECIFIC SOURCE</strong>.</p>
