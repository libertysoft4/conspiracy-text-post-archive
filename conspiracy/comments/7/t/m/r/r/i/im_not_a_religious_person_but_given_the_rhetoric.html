        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Islam:</strong></p>

<p>Jesus is the penultimate prophet and messenger of God.  </p>

<p>Jesus is a Messiah (Christ), sent to guide the Children of Israel with a new revelation.  </p>

<p>Jesus is the most mentioned person in the Quran.</p>

<p>The Quran teaches Jesus to have been born a &quot;pure boy&quot; (without sin) to Mary as the result of virginal conception, similar to the event of the Annunciation in Christianity.</p>

<p>In Islamic theology, Jesus is believed to have performed many miracles.</p>

<p>Muslim belief is that Jesus did not physically die, but was instead raised alive to heaven.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam</a></p>

<p><strong>Judaism</strong></p>

<p>Jesus is viewed as having been the most damaging of all false messiahs.</p>

<p>Judaism has never accepted any of the claimed fulfillments of prophecy that Christianity attributes to Jesus. </p>

<p>Traditional views of Jesus have been an account that portrays Jesus as an impostor who committed blasphemy.</p>

<p>The Talmud teaches that Jesus is being punished for all eternity by being boiled in his own excrement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What has always &quot;ground my gears&quot; is the FACT that many who shroud themselves in the bible and use it as a baseball bat at times completely ignore what Jesus said about how to treat the poorest among us. Additionally, the radical right are in deep denial about the fact that the prophesies of Jesus are liberal leaning, the moneychangers he kicked out of the temple weren&#39;t tree hugging vegans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it&#39;s because of the artificial creation of the concept of Judeo-Christianity.</p>

<p>&quot;The term (Judeo-Christianity) in its current form originated with George Orwell as a linguistic attempt to fight anti-Semitism in the late 1930s.&quot;</p>

<p>You can&#39;t make this shit up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you. And like OP said, Islam shows more respect for Jesus in the Quran than Jews do in just about anything. I mean they did have Jesus killed. Muslims didn’t do that. Christians have more in common with Muslims than we do Jews. But shhhh, that’s not supposed to be talked about. Christians and Muslims are supposed to hate each other. </p>

<p>Egypt was a democratic country, from 2012 to 2013, just one year.<br/>

<p>That makes sense and fulfilled prophecies written 680-701BC by the prophet Isaiah</p>

<p>3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</p>

<p>4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</p>

<p>5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</p>

<p>6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</p>

<p>7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</p>

<p>8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.</p>

<p>9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</p>

<p>10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.</p>

<p>11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</p>

<p>12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>
