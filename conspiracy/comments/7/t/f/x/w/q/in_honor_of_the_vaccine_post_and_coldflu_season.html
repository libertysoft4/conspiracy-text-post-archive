        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To start, I am not a doctor, this isn’t medical advice.  I do not advocate avoiding medical treatment for serious illness and this isn’t discussing that.  The purpose is to point out some basic good practices about staying healthy without medicine and advice that has worked for me in regard to maintaining health while avoiding antibiotics and other chemical medications.  It is general advice on being healthy and preventative care anyone can do.</p>

<p>That said, with all the doubt here about flu vaccines and medicine in general, I felt like putting together a small list of things that are helpful in staying healthy on your own.  I go to a doctor for serious issues but I don’t get flu vaccines and I generally avoid getting ill often despite working around many people and being exposed to lots of germs.</p>

<p>Number one, and it blows my mind how few people are aware of these, <strong>get a netti pot</strong>!  (Of course follow instructions on keeping it clean and sterile btw or you will be poisoning yourself with bacteria and fungus).  If you are unaware of these, they are little pitchers which you use to flush your sinus cavity with a saline solution.  They are dirt cheap and very effective.  </p>

<p>The saline flush both helps relief inflammation and remove all sorts of funk from your sinus cavity that can lead to infections.  All without chemicals or taking medicines.  I find it best to use in the evenings when not feeling any sinus problems just to flush out all the dust and contaminants that you get in your nasal passages in a normal day.  It makes it so much easier to breathe at night.  I have found it to greatly help with my own chronic sinus inflammation and reduce sleep apnea.  When treating a cold (and again, this is minor colds where you might buy some OTC meds not ones where you would seek a doctor) I use it 2-3x a day.  This works <em>much</em> better than mucus pills or chemical nasal spray to instantly relieve congestion and empty the sinus of mucus.  It is much safer than decongestant medicine and cheaper.  I would recommend trying one before buying Sudafed or something similar.</p>

<p>Next is vitamins.  These are important but it is <em>always</em> better to get as much as possible from food rather than from pills.  There are tons of diets that tell you which fresh foods are best to eat for increasing particular vitamin levels.  That said, I find in this time of year, the best way to prevent being sick is to increase as much as possible Vitamin C, Zinc and Magnesium.  B complexes are good also.  I avoid vitamin D supplements because most you would find at a drug store are made with Soybean oil :/.</p>

<p>Another treatment that works well for throat inflammations from sinuses or dry air is a ginger/honey solution.  Honey is a natural disinfectant and ginger helps soothe tissue.  I grind fresh ginger and steep it in hot water like tea.  When the water begins to cool to around 100 F add honey until it gets to a semi thick viscosity but still flows readily and drink it slowly letting the honey coat the back of your throat and sort of relax and let it sit there as long as possible.  A cup full of this drunk over about 10 minutes provides good relief. </p>

<p>Further, Absinthe (the actual kind with herbal extracts not the colored everclear) was originally made as a medicinal tincture rather than as a beverage.  A “hot toddy” made with absinthe rather than whiskey is another great treatment for throat and sinuses, the fennel and anise and other herbs provide a slight anesthetic and the high alcohol content a bit of disinfectant.  Take this with about a shot of absinthe as medicine, not to get drunk.</p>

<p>Hope some of this may help avoid filling yourselves with chemicals to treat minor colds and prevent them getting worse from lingering bacteria.  If anyone else has advice (preferably legit herbal remedies or healthy diets not crazy treatments like ear candles) post here too. </p>

<p>Add some turmeric to the mix and you got something even more effective. My favorite cold and flu and general wellness remedy is to make medicinal honeys. Fill a jar with equal parts grated ginger and turmeric root and pour honey, preferably raw, over it to fill the jar. Let it steep for a week or two and then strain it out. The honey will take on a dark golden color and a thin, syrupy consistency. Now you&#39;ve got yourself a potent cold and flu rememedy that you can take by the spoonful or in hot water/tea. Take it often even when you&#39;re not sick, and it&#39;ll help keep you from getting sick.</p>

<p>You can do this with any medicinal or culinary herb. Take any fresh herb (you can use dried but I think fresh is better), pour honey over it, steep anywhere from 3 days to a month+, and strain it out. This is a really easy way to begin practicing herbal medicine. Different herbs have different medicinal benefits, so do a little research into what herb to use to treat whatever particular ailment you want treated. There are some exceptions of course, but most common herbs are safe for most people to take. Pregnant women and people on prescription medications should be a bit more cautious. </p>

<p>Herbal honeys have the added bonus of tasting fantastic, so you can use them for culinary purposes too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn I never even thought of that! THC is only fat soluble though, so it is doubtful that you could make a honey that will get you high. But the other compounds in cannabis might be soluble in honey, I am really not sure. It is worth a shot. Although, medicinal honeys uses a lot of herbs, so unless you&#39;re growing your own, thats gonna be some expensive honey. If it were me and I had whole plants, I would use the whole plant in the solution. Stalks, leaves, and buds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a healthcare worker so the whole &quot;WASH YOUR HANDS EVERY SECOND&quot; is drilled into me, but people wash their hands a lot less than you think and doorknobs, subway poles etc. are <em>filthy</em>. There&#39;s a reason doorplates in hospitals are made of brass - it self sterilizes due to some ionic business. Triclosan, the antibiotic in most soaps, is more or less useless. It&#39;s like Polysporin - yes, there is a grouping of antibacterial agents in it, but they&#39;ve all been ineffective for ages and you get more benefit our of the cream part keeping the wound moist than the abx part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good supplement to take on a regular basis is Olive Leaf Extract. It kills everything! No joke! So why not take it on a daily basis? I do!</p>

<p>A few years ago, I had a uterine infection that refused to go away. My OB/GYN put me on every known antibiotic, and it wouldn&#39;t go away. His last resort was to suggest a hysterectomy.</p>

<p>Well, I refused the hysterectomy and decided to research natural cures first. I stumbled upon an article about Olive Leaf Extract and thought I would give it a shot. I took a little bit more than was suggested (hoping to kill the infection). It worked!!!!! Infection went away and I didn&#39;t have a hysterectomy.</p>

<p>Because of this event, I started researching natural cures and preventative herbs/vitamins for everything!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Knowing how to fight illnesses &quot;naturally&quot; is going to be more and more important as germs get stronger and our medicines less effective. Some thoughts:</p>

<p>-The healthier you are in general, the better you will be able to resist infection and fight it off when you succumb. Whole foods, minimal processing, regular activity. </p>

<p>-Stay clean, be aware of how you interact with germ vectors. Wash your hands often. Stop touching your face as much as possible. </p>

<p>-Essential oils from the spices and herbs some others have mentioned are really effective at germ killing and boosting your immune system. These are oils like cinnamon, clove, oregano, rosemary, orange and lemon, and eucalyptus. This actually dates back to the plauge...graverobbers would cover their faces with it to stay safe.</p>

<p>-Eat a buttload of garlic, the more raw the better.</p>

<p>-If ill (even when not), consume as much fluid as you can possibly manage. This allows your immune response to cycle out germs rapidly.</p>

<p>-Don&#39;t inhibit a low-grade fever with medicine, it is killing off germs for you. Obviously disregard for high fevers.</p>

<p>-SLEEP and REST. You are working very hard fighting germs, and exhausting yourself will kill your chances at a quick recovery. </p>
