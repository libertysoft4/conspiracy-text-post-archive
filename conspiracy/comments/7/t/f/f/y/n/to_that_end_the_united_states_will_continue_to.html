    <div class="md"><p>well i wouldn&#39;t disagree. i think you are right actually. BUT i also think trump is just playing the game.</p>

<p>he got the nomination basically against the will of the established party, so if he ever hoped to get anything through that congress he had to play ball, pence imho was part of that.</p>

<p>i think almost more than the Dems the republican establishment wants him out of the way so their boy pence gets to run the show.</p>

<p>i was holding out hoping Donnie wouldn&#39;t be in the AIPAC pocket but that hope faded with the embassy decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t get as much power, media exposure, and money as Trump has without playing their game from the get-go. I truly believe the media antics and antagonism were just a ploy. Prior to Trump, it was already known that trust in the MSM was at an all time low, then this buffoon comes along trying to purposely make an enemy of them. The MSM and alt-shill media are the ones who pushed this anti-establishment and outsider narrative from his candidacy onwards.</p>

<p>It was a narrative swallowed on blind faith by his supporters - believing that there might be some legitimacy left in the farce that is US democracy. The reality is there isn&#39;t, and his supporters got played. I know it sucks for them considering the time/energy they put into supporting him, and I feel bad for them too. But it&#39;s really time to wake up to the bullshit, and stop empowering the establishment under the guise of being anti-establishment. </p>

<p>Things will never change if the people who actually want change are distracted by this circus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i still feel trump played the media, rather than them installing him intentionally. there was just too much real shock for the whole thing to have been the plan all along.</p>

<p>trump has played the media like a fiddle for at least 20 years i see no reason why that would suddenly change.</p>

<p>the reality is if trump was as deep in bed with the establishment as some seem to think there were a million easier ways for them to have a more easily controlled puppet there.</p>

<p>sure it might be less distractions but i really think people have started paying MORE attention to what the government is doing looking for that &quot;gotcha&quot; moment to catch trump.</p>

<p>if it werent for trump the republicans would have put forward Jeb, and it would have been the choice of a clinton or a bush, both primary establishment families.</p>

<p>it just seems like a lot of wasted effort to get trump in if he is just a puppet for the deep state, when they could have just let it play out with out the buffonery and a lot less people would be paying attention than are now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing something here. </p>

<p>Obama was a great puppet sure. But with the internet and ease of information access, his friendly charismatic act was even drawing the ire of liberals and the left. &quot;Hey Obama, if you&#39;re so pro-human rights, peace/love for all, etc. why are you arming and funding Israel, Saudis, ISIS, funding genocide,etc.? Why are you giving more power to private insurance companies? Why aren&#39;t the bankers who caused the crises being jailed?&quot; The neoliberal act of caring humanity and the public while warmongering, consolidating power into the corporate class, giving bankers free reign government funds, etc. was beginning to crumble. The facade could no longer hold up.</p>

<p>Trump is the <em>perfect</em> puppet. He gives the establishment free reign to do whatever they want because he is beholden to no one. The traditional role of media and the public to hold government accountable no longer holds any sway. Even Israel has been carrying out very brazen moves that they could have never done under Obama such as the Jerusalem move, declaring they will annex Palestinian land, and beginning to seal off the west bank (banning various groups, etc), since they have the perfect patsy and supporter in the white house. He is a great distraction and takes all the windfall for all the pro-establishment moves he makes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate that youre considering it and I do understand what youre saying. However you can say there is so much scrutiny to the point of information overload. Each thing Trump does daily would be a months long news story in any other country. It is hard to even take the time to analyze it, and by the time you can it is on to the next crazy thing.</p>

<p>I do want to bring up how patsys operate in any conspiracy though. Except I would say Trump is a willing scapegoat. It is kind of like how Debbie Schultz operated in the DNC or Ellen Pao on reddit - you need someone to ruin their rep doing the dirty work the establishment wants done quickly and brazenly.</p>

<p>Trump is taking all the heat now doing the dirty work. When Trump is out of office having been able to ram through all the horrible things the establishment wants, people are just going to look back and blame him like they did Bush. It will be another &quot;reformer&quot; like Obama who is just going to continue all the same policies as his predecessor except maybe quietly and with a nicer, more likeable face and more pleasant language. </p>
