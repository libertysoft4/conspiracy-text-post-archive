<p>Think of what you could accomplish with this. They know the Internet is the &quot;new media&quot;, and it&#39;s how the different factions within the truth movement spread ideas and awaken the public. </p>

<p>If they flooded these outlets with fake accounts that looked real, you could take over the narrative, and steer all the real users in a certain direction. I&#39;m starting to think this is their ultimate goal. I remember getting a PM from a shill a few months back, something to the effect of;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Every second, of every day, for the rest of your life, we gain more of the technology needed to reach every living human on earth. There is no great awakening, there is only &quot;Us&quot;.</strong></p>

<p>Even Facebook seems to be loaded with them, using their same divisive tactics and narrative control. How many people would ever suspect that there are millions of fake accounts on Facebook masquerading as real people? They&#39;re everywhere in the comments sections of videos like police brutality, geoengineering, banking, ect.</p>

<p>Everytime a police brutality video is posted, the top comment is always some shit like,</p>

<p>&quot;If he was black he&#39;d be dead!&quot;</p>

<p>Like, every fucking time. They don&#39;t even try to be transparent. </p>

<p>And the worst part is, how the fuck would anybody know that post could potentially be a bot or a shill? They are essentially creating a fucking &quot;Truman show&quot; style takeover of the free internet by deploying a massive army of shills and bots, in hopes of slowing down and delaying, or completely sabotaging our awakening.</p>

<p>Please try to keep an open mind regarding this idea, and don&#39;t immediately shoot it down because it seems unlikely or impossible to you. This is exactly the kind of lengths this crime syndicate would go to, to prevent a massive global awakening. They have all the money and time in the world to put a grid of control like this into place. </p>

<p>For communities like this that should know what is going on, we could take extreme action to mitigate the problem, such as restricting voting and commenting to accounts who have subscribed for at least 2 or 3 years, but even that would just be a short-term band-aid.  </p>

<p>I sincerely believe this problem is an existential threat to our social structure and it will take criminal investigation and prosecution to fully deal with the issue. </p>

<p>However, there would be a massive public backlash if it ever came to the public&#39;s attention.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give you several reasons why we should be worried about shilling and 1 solution to all of it. </p>

<p>If a person is paid to shill and they have 20 accounts, they can downvote or upvote anything, which means they can censor or artificially increase the number of views a post or comment receives. Remember Reddit&#39;s favorite scientist? <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8qx57x/reddits-favorite-scientist-just-got-banned-for-cheating-the-site">Redditor Unidan was caught using six separate accounts to destroy competing posts.</a> Now imagine the resources behind large corporations, presidential campaigns, etc. </p>

<p>If a person is paid to shill and they have 20 accounts, they can create a false consensus on specific threads, fooling the users into thinking that something is settled or that there is nothing to a claim. They can harass or keep specific users busy with a flood of replies. </p>

<p>The solution to all of this is simply <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=jcs6movv&amp;amp;sh=1a7eaccb">spreading information about shills</a>. If users are knowledgeable about how widespread and effective the practice is, they might spend a little more time looking at the comments at the bottom of a controversial thread. They might look further into a claim and fact check if they sense that a thread could be manipulated. They might stop caring that a comment has 1,000 upvotes and gold, and instead evaluate the comment based on the sources and argument presented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most people who get dismissed as shills are just poorly educated Americans (some with college degrees) who don&#39;t really know or understand how to make an argument.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like 1984, but instead of simplifying language, they have simplified modes of rhetoric and analysis. Which is why, I think memes are so popular even though the mass of them are pretty idiotic. </p>

<p>What people really find suspicious is when you can hold two countervailing and contradictory opinions simultaneously like America is a great country and America is the most evil country in the history of the world. These are two things I believe and argue about. Sometimes within the same argument.</p>

<p>You see this shit all the time when the most cliche, most straightforward kind of propagandistic truism underlies a news story or a heavily gilded reddit comment. People want to believe and are primed to believe that reality is simple, when the truth is very much the opposite. And I&#39;m not even talking in a conspiratorial sense.</p>

<p>It&#39;s that ever pervasive sense of certitude, whether it be science or politics or economics or medicine, when reality is still a big fucking mystery and contemplating that mystery is a worthwhile endeavor, instead of pretending like we have anything close to being figured out.</p>

<p>Sorry, a rambling rant, apologies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think with your america is a great country but also evil. It might help to think of it like this; America is great for a country, as great as a country has been so far, but even so it is still greater at destruction, subterfuge, counterfeit, manipulation, etc. Etc. Because our world does not have a history of great countries who also acted great. It has a history of dark wars. So when weighing something on a scale it is important to note that we havent reached what a pinnacle society can be. A d may never. But at this point and time it is one of the great ones to live in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m always wary of any cult of personality types like Jordan Peterson. Though I do specifically agree with his point that freedom of speech should never be legally restricted by any means.</p>

<p>However, regarding your point about discrimination, I think it is worth pointing out and challenging all forms of oppression; especially its main purveyor, the state, which uses bigotry and hate to consolidate its own power through divide and conquer. Many in academia get caught up into a specific form of oppression, pigeonhole themselves as victims, etc. that they end up becoming pawns of the state and elite that they claim to be against - or perhaps they&#39;re more so controlled opposition. This is kind of where I see Jordan Peterson as well, but I could be wrong since as I said I purposely avoid cultish personalities.</p>

<p>But I think it&#39;s obvious that there is no money or power truly pushing toward marxist ideology; the only goal is to increase and secure the power of the already powerful elite and state actors. The true goal is totalitarianism. </p>

These easy targets are what probably help create and fuel the second growing hive mind of right wing crazy people who swallow there narrative from there news. </p>

<p>Anybody who falls into this and is spending vast amounts of time shilling their teams narrative,and the ppl who use dehumanizing generalizing terms for the opposing side of brainwashed political obsessed people, the people who do this regularly no matter which side of the fence are a very dangerous and possible sought after random group of individuals.

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse my poor use of language if that is the bullshit you refer to.. Unless you take issue with me calling out the number of ridiculous posts on political reddit made by SOMETHING. An alarming amount of people seem to really be overly enthusiastic about there party&#39;s upcoming vindication. Are these people for real? Why so many emotionally driven ridicule generalize &quot;all democrats&quot; or &quot;all trump supporters&quot;.  Are these people as fucking brainwashed in real life as they appear when in the echo chambers of there own subreddit or media platforms or newsoursce</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a big misunderstood that for awakining &quot;internet&quot; is necessary, as it is true that as a tool to get information it is very powerful and useful, it is not neccesary for people to awake, it is not some big &quot;movement&quot; in an internet forum, is something beyond the digital world, that will not and frankly cannot be stopped, because it is something natural and as consequence it will happen no matter what, the difference relies on who &quot;tunes&quot;  into this new reality, that is all this is, all you need is the desire to live in a better world and take action towards that, even if it is as simple as a change of attitude</p>

<p>&quot;Awakining&quot; to a higher realization and more abundant and positive civilization, Whether or not you have internet won&#39;t matter in the slightest</p>

I think it&#39;s incredibly important to not only know that this is a propaganda war, but that the same tactic is being used by groups right here in the US. It&#39;s not just Russia.
