        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So we have discussed about various conspiracies related to health such as: vaccinations, water fluoridation, modern GMOd diet, vegetarian diet, sugar, pharmaceutical drugs, entheogens, meditation etc.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be a good idea to compile a list of health practices that are outside of the norm to benefit our fellow members.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with advocating strongly for meditation.</p>

<p>Just setting aside some time in a day to simply sit and observe your breathing and thoughts can do wonders. This practice will translate to an increase in focus and perception by way of getting used to the feeling of being in the &quot;present&quot;.</p>

<p>Much of our lives are spent somehow living in the future or past, worrying about what happened yesterday or thinking about the next thing that will be in store, and meanwhile we miss out on the present. The present now that is always there, and always will be there.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t done it before all you need to do is
1. Sit down in a quiet place without distractions
2. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing 
3. When you notice a thought, just acknowledge the fact that you are currently having a thought and then let it fade away
4. Focus back on your breathing 
5. Repeat 3/4 </p>

<p>You may want to set a timer for this. </p>

<p>Meditation will increase the quality of your life in subtle ways at first, but will increase exponentially in leaps and bounds as you start to understand the purpose behind it. Later on you will be able to meditate using different methods once you have gotten the hang of being in the present. </p>

<p>Disclaimer: I am not an expert by any means so please excuse my clumsy explanation, I am just a guy just trying to figure it all out. If anyone has any further tips, feel free to share. </p>

<p>or, take Acetyl-L-Carnetine (Carnitine? ugh! spelling sucks) .. before you drink.  allows a nice tipsy feeling, seems to consistently stave off the omg-DUMB-drunk feeling, and drastically limits follow-on hangover.</p>

<p>Fluoride is the tip of the iceberg. It shouldn&#39;t even register on the radar of people in here because we have much bigger problems with water. Some areas have lied on the water quality tests to hide contamination of lead and other contaminants. </p>

<p>If you are the type of person who still wants to focus on fluoride despite it being such a relatively minor issue, your best bet is to just show other people this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379717304956">Children and adolescents who did not drink tap water had lower prevalence of elevated blood lead levels and higher prevalence of dental caries than those who drank tap water.</a></p>

<p>If you drink tap water, you have a higher chance of elevated blood lead levels. If you don&#39;t drink tap water, you have a higher chance of dental carries, but lower blood lead levels. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>look into &quot;learned optimism&quot;, a book by Dr Martin Seligman.  he has a balanced view, that there are times and entire careers that need pessimism, but overall he wants people to have/find/build mental tools to thwart feeling helpless (in contrast, pure positive thinking is potentially dangerous, depending on context).  I&#39;m not doing it enough justice; should be available at a library, it&#39;s been out awhile.  if you&#39;re a parent with kids who need that kind of help, he wrote The Optimistic Child, too, which is simplified for busy parents and has cartoon fill in the blank exercises to help your kids with the concepts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a whole lot bothers me in Life. I am generally one of the Most happy positive people I know. Lots of people love to follow my example and lead happy healthy lives. </p>

<p>Movement, enjoying life, doing things makes me really happy.  Stillness, silence, loneliness those frustrate me and make me Angry.</p>

<p>As a child we had a Physical Ed Teacher who was trying to teach us Yoga and Meditation.  All it did was make me angry.  As an adult I revisited each of these. Yoga as a body exercise is great.  Wonderful for strength and toning.  Meditation, still makes me angry. Walking and Daydreaming I can do all the time, but stillness and opening of the mind, just brings out all my rage. </p>

<p>Being happy is easy.  Just look at all the wonderful things in life all the time. Example: had to get up early today...5AM.  That could be seen as bad, but going outside to work I saw a glorious sunrise on the way in.  Gorgeous Happiness.</p>

<p>I strive to avoid Negativeness, but when I see something destructive like Meditation.  I speak out. </p>

<p>Walking in Nature is Not Meditation.  That is getting out and doing well. That I am all for.  I walk and Daydream all the Time. </p>

<p>But sitting still to open your mind.  NAh, that only brings out rage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Walk &amp; daydream is the shiz! I&#39;ve heard it called walking meditation (walking labyrinths is another), when I described it to sit&amp;ohm types. Like, they have a specific thing they get from sitting, but wanted to encourage whatever worked for me.  </p>

<p>What part of the country/planet are you in? There&#39;s a website that tracks publicly walkable labyrinths :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same, so glad someone else has had such good results. I&#39;ve lost almost 100 pounds since going vegan without even trying. Cutting out processed food and fast food makes such a difference, forces you to have to cook for yourself. Also not eating the chemical death soup that is factory farmed meat.</p>

<p>TLDR fix your microbiome, avoid GMOs, inflammatory foods, flame grilled meat, wheat, soy, any produce from third world countries like China, factory farmed food and especially fish.</p>

<p>Eat a high quality unprocessed diet thats nutrient dense but low in calories. Also make sure your vitamin is safe and doesnt use industrial waste like the racemic form of vit E(dl-alpha tocopherol). </p>

<p>Get lots of lutein and zeaxanthin so you have bionic vision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good stuff. There&#39;s another one, I forget the name, but a variant that isn&#39;t quite the methyl version and is also sought by those avoiding the chemical byproduct version (cyanocobalamin).   </p>

<p>Not that anyone should be using it anymore, but the talc in talcum powerd is extracted from asbestos-rich areas. Yum!</p>
