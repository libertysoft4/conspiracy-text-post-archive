    <div class="md"><p>As a former health worker, I’m going to share some knowledge here. First, it’s HIPAA. One P, two A’s. Health Insurance Portability and Privacy Act.  That act grants US citizens very clear privacy rights as found here:  <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/medical-records/index.html">https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/medical-records/index.html</a>  Long government story short, only you and/or your assigned and documented designee may access your health records. Covered Entities such as hospitals and physician practices must abide by this, and similarly may only ever access the minimum necessary information for treatment, payment, or operations. The same holds true for your information sent to other covered entities; only the minimum may be sent to continue care. </p>

<p>Now, here’s the rub. </p>

<p>The same government that enacted all those good things to secure your privacy has, as part of HIPAA’s second-cousin once removed HITECH Act, mandated that covered entities modernize their operations via implementing electronic medical records systems. These are your Epics, Meditechs, Cerners, and Athenas; systems that standardize codes, content, record retention, and patient notes.  On top of that, the government also instituted what is called Meaningful Use. Covered entities were incentivized to go electronic and report anonymized data to show capability, efficiency, and improve patient satisfaction. </p>

<p>Okay, you think, that seems good, right?  Hospitals are using faster tablets and standard processes rather than jotting shitty illegible notes on some paper to be filed away or lost. But this still isn’t the end of it.  The government has also begun incentivizing states to create Health Information Exchanges.</p>

<p>The HIEs also sound great on paper. Inter-linking all covered entities in a state mean you can travel to any hospital, any walk-in, any participating practice, and they’ll be able to pull up your relevant history. X-rays, allergies, blood type, all just a few keystrokes away...</p>

<p>It will be, I’m estimating, just under 8-10 years before multi-HIEs begin fully nationally linking their databases. Again, for them it’s an easy sales pitch. “What if you’re vacationing and skiiing in the Rockies and break your leg?  Why, the Rocky Mountain Medical Center will simply pull up your home practice records and give you the best care in the world!”</p>

<p>It’s all bullshit. </p>

<p>OP’s post adds a wrinkle to all of the above.  Controlled substances are treated as this blind two-way street; covered entities will agree that documenting controlled substance usage is a federal thing, so they have to document it. The state, and by proxy the police, will say because it’s a controlled substance, they should be able to reference it when fearing for their lives on routine traffic stops. Currently, most states would argue against that leap of logic; so Jersey is setting an interesting prescedent.  If it goes through, it’ll be just yet another control method. </p>

<p>No TL;DR. Please read and understand how widespread your medical information travels. </p>

<p>Pro-tip:  Health Information Exchanges are typically opt-out and not communicated to you. Search for your state’s HIE(s), get their number and address, and both call and write them a letter telling them you opt out of their services and that you do not give permission to anyone to access your records. </p>

<p>Pro-tip 2: ALL covered entities are legally required to provide you with what is called an Accounting of Disclosures. It shows a listing of every single person that has accessed your electronic records. Request methods vary, but please do this annually - think of it as your medical credit report. Ask them to identify accesses specially broken up by Treatment, Payment, and Operations (easier for you to interpret). If you see record accesses not attributed to billing and which do not coincide with any visits, dig deeper. Own your information and make those who misuse it pay. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your in HR you need to educate yourself on hippa. Its very serious. Violation could result in millions in fines to your company and jail time for you! Bottom line, you cannot share any medical information about employees with anyone. Sounds easy right? Nope! Lets say employee &#39;sally,&#39; is sick and has a Dr. Appointment.. So you send an email out to all employees saying she&#39;s at the Dr. And won&#39;t be back this afternoon. Harmless right? Your company could be fined  100s of thousands for that alone. Example 2. Your at the water cooler and you talk to &#39;Bob&#39; about how &#39;Jim&#39; takes medication for whatever...Harmless? Nope, and you personally could go to prison!!! Not like 30 days..more like 3 years!</p>

<p>I of course know damn well what that is.  So, you have no defense other to spew a stupid straw man argument?  The OP was spewing lies about something else.  Look at the damn title.  I think the OP is an insurgent that is trying to make us look stupid by trying to get people to repeat an obvious lie.  Law enforcement?</p>

If he is seeing 10 doctors , 100 pills each they have to know to step in and stop it to prevent his death</p>
