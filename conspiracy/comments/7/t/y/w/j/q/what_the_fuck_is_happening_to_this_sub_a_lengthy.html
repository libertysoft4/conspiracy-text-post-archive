        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You know that this sub could be tolerable if the mods actually gave a shit about this place. Rules are unenforced. Threads are brigaded non-stop. Establishment propaganda is upvoted while even non-partisan talking points and plausible political conspiracies are downvoted to oblivion. </p>

<p>Some threads have people backing up points with(and I shit you not) &quot;well the Director of the CIA said so&quot; and wouldn&#39;t you know it? upvoted to the top. Is this r/conspiracy or what?</p>

<p><strong>Some rules of r/conspiracy that are not enforced:</strong></p>

<p>Rule 3. No blog spam - usually half the front page is taken up with illegitimate garbage blog sites with no credible sources</p>

<p>Rule 5. No trolling - this sub&#39;s active participants is now mostly trolls, they&#39;re so fucking easy to spot yet nothing is <strong>ever</strong> done about it.</p>

<p>Rule 6. Titles and comments with a large percentage of caps lock - all the time on the front page. There&#39;s always a couple of sensationalist crap with big CAPS ridden titles.</p>

<p>Rule 9. Posting links in other subs pointing to specific submissions or comments here is subject to a ban - r/TopRetardsOfReddit anyone? Their sub literally encourages its users to brigade other subreddits, yet they seem to be able to vote and comment here regularly. Again rule 5 - they are only here to troll and disrupt conversation.</p>

<p>Rule 10. (this is rich) Posts that attack this sub, users or mods thereof, will be removed. Accusing another user of being a troll or shill can be viewed as an attack - This subreddit is apparently not open to critique. Any concerns you may have should be directed to the modmail, which has a high chance of being ignored. 
I made a suggestion last month to make voting <strong>subscriber only</strong>, as is the case with other subreddits that have had problems with trolls hijacking threads. </p>

<p>It is also quite laughable that you cannot accuse someone of being a shill, even someone with a 2-week old account that does nothing but post establishment propaganda in r/conspiracy. Don&#39;t bother trying to out them, but if you happen to disagree with any MSM propaganda in a conspiracy subreddit of all places, be prepared to have accusations of being a Russian troll hurled at you without any consequence.</p>

<p>Rule 11. Misleading, fabricated or sensationalist headlines - Again, the same shit you see in relation to Rule 3 all the time here. The same trash conspiracy blogs that the morons upvote without question. It&#39;s almost like they&#39;re purposefully not interfered with as it doesn&#39;t hurt to let a bunch of unintelligent spam dictate the look of the front page.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t be the only one thinking this, but mods where are you? How can the community even trust you anymore with how bad you let this subreddit become? If you&#39;re the police, then who&#39;ll police the police?</p>

A better question is what happened to this country? We used to be fans of personal liberty, greed got in the way. The only way to convey ideas is through communication. This sub, and all text based forms of communication are subject to industrial types who see personal gain and take advantage.  You can play a shitty game for charity, or you can throw in the towel from fear. The last choice we have is choice. Use it or lose it dude. You could be useful, or you could be a martyr only in your own mind. If you plan on procreating the choice is pre determined. We&#39;re all tired of tyranny, maybe throw us a bone here</p>

<p>&quot;Flat Earth&quot;, &quot;No Planes&quot;, &quot;Russia-Gate&quot;, race and identity politics baiting all over every day.</p>

<p>Stupid SHOCK CAP BREAKING RETARD clickbait headlines with low effort navel gazing narcissistic ramblings or links to meta-fringe time eating bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, most of Reddit, especially the front page stories, has been like this for a long time. It&#39;s not near as organic as it used to be. You gotta dig through a lot of trash, and it&#39;s impossible to police it all without censoring so much that there is no purpose. There are forces at work, yes, we know. Part of what a good redditor can do, especially in r/conspiracy, is to know these tactics.</p>

<p>Branching out, however, there are other ways to work through it. A lot of what can benefit the discourse here, and benefit what we&#39;re all talking about that is crazy in the world, is by doing something in reality. Remember to stand up and speak your mind at work, on the street. Find a place where you can talk to real people. Maybe it&#39;s the bar, maybe the coffee shop, the open mic, maybe the mall, maybe city hall. Find an event. Music often brings people together. If you want a guarantee you&#39;re talking to a real person, <em>and</em> a guarantee you&#39;ll make at least a some difference, you will get one right outside your door.</p>

<p>That being said, you may have some good suggestions, I don&#39;t know. I try not to think about <em>why</em> the pattern shifts of reddit, but to watch and learn  <em>what the pattern is</em> and then <em>how</em> to roll through it. Positive dialogue can be found when you look in the right places.</p>

<p>When they do that, point out that they&#39;re doing that. Calling someone a shill is an ad hominem fallacy and just dumb. Proving that they&#39;re a shill by pointing out how they&#39;re spamming lying propaganda on a brand new account can be a sound rational argument that doesn&#39;t break any rules. </p>

<p>Imagine if there was no rule 10. All of the shills would be trolling constantly with personal attacks. You desire the freedom to insult shills, and that&#39;s reasonable, but if that freedom is afforded to everyone, you&#39;ll be on the receiving end of their personal attacks. You might think &quot;fine by me&quot;, but I don&#39;t want to read long threads of idiots calling each other shill back and forth. If you can&#39;t support an insult with reason or evidence, then i have no interest in reading your inflammatory shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A mere few weeks ago you would be able to browse by new and find some content appropriate for this sub. This is not the case anymore. New is as bloated with religious and political partisan propaganda. These accounts post them by the dozen. Other subs prohibit same content posts by different people. Every time we get a new headline in the msm about either party this sub is flooded with posts about it. This isn’t r/conspiracy. It hasn’t been for a while now. This is now a combination r/politics and r/t_d. The partisan posts and the ones from folks claiming to be, claiming to know who is, Jesus is laughable. Sex bot panic, your party is shittier than mine, Satan has taken over the world, team of senators impeaching, presidential chess, none of this has anything to do with this sub. It’s a freaking joke that folks don’t complain to get these posts deleted and the repeat offenders banned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guys nonstop spamming about how there’s no Russian collusion and how bad Hillary while denying literally any wrongdoing by the actual president are also claiming this place is taken over by shills just because it’s not the_donald or voat echo chamber they’re used to. It’s absolutely hilarious seeing the guy crying about shills here in r/conspiracy also contribute regularly to the_donald. There’s the problem, like someone said. The sub is basically t_d and politics fighting grounds with both sides screaming shill at every opportunity. Think Trump and Russia colluded some? You work for shareblue. Want actual solid evidence of something and not the weakest word association possible? You’re a shill. Want to know what ruined this sub for me? The people that treat this sub as t_d 2.0. Hillary sucks, we don’t need to see 20 submissions a day about it while totally denying the actual president has done anything wrong ever in his life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shill accusations destroy this sub. They are pointless and silly. If you think someone is a shill, argue back against their point. If you think they&#39;re just being annoying to distract you, downvote them and move on.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s especially annoying is that literally people with month old accounts will call other people with month old accounts shills because of the age of their accounts. Then when confronted, they&#39;ll say, &quot;Yeah, but my account is only new because I changed accounts.&quot; Well, that should be your answer right there. A lot of people change their accounts for various reasons, including getting threats and whatnot on this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, some of the inarguably shittier
 aspects of the sub are for me, as easy to just scroll past and barely even see anymore, like the fucking pun threads..I just mentally filter out the noise and very rarely engage because at the end of the day, there&#39;s just no point. No hearts and minds have been changed no matter how hard I worked on some comments so they&#39;d be informative, well-sourced and intended as one human being trying to share good information to another. That&#39;s what we&#39;re supposed to do in order to do cool shit like evolve, learn stuff and share what we learn. </p>

<p>Plus I&#39;ve simply decided that I&#39;m just not gonna deal with the anger of angry people, either remain civil or remain silent.</p>
