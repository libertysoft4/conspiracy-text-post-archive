    <div class="md"><p>I specifically said your question was very broad and picked 1 topic. Like, yes extremely deep caves, rain forests, and a giant frozen fucking continent pose their own challenges and risk to explore.</p>

<p>They&#39;re extremely remote and difficult to get to. Seems logical to me, but I&#39;m not the one sitting here going &quot;how do you know&quot; in response to a question that pressure is very high at extreme depths and denying space exists or what ever shit you subscribe to.</p>

<p>?? You didn&#39;t state you were comparing religion to space travel and exploration you simply made an analogy between space and religion. Might want to be more clear while you&#39;re busy moving those goal posts around.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How do you know?</p>

<p>Are you seriously about to sit there and fucking argue against physics....</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure</a></p>

<p>Well, let’s see if we can work this one out. First, we have to understand how pressure is measured. If we were to take a one inch column of air all the way up through the atmosphere, it would weigh 14.7 pounds. For this reason, we like to say that the standard air pressure (at sea level) is 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). Water weighs more than this, though. Each one inch column that’s one foot deep will weigh 0.445 pounds.</p>

<p>So if you’re right at sea level, the pressure will be 14.7 psi. And for every foot you go underwater, you add another 0.445 psi. So at one foot deep, the pressure would be 14.7 psi + 0.445 psi = 15.145 psi. And at two feet deep it would be 14.7 psi + 2<em>(0.445 psi) = 15.59 psi, etc. In order to get to 2 atmospheres worth of air pressure, you would need to get to the point where there’s 29.4 psi (2 times 14.7 psi). To get to 29.4 psi, it turns out that you would need to be 33 feet deep. (Since 14.7 psi + 33</em>0.445 psi = 29.4 psi.)</p>

<p>Again man you&#39;re free to believe what ever you want but, what are you gaining out of this? </p>

<p>That&#39;s absolutely not true. We know more about the surface of the moon than the depths of our sea, but that&#39;s not surprising. It&#39;s a lot easier to send something up into space than to develop an extensive way to map and study the ocean floor. But we absolutely do not know more about space. Not even a bit. Normal matter makes up about 5% of space. 68% is dark energy. 27% is dark matter. And we have absolutely no fucking idea what that 95% composition is. Add in the fact that there&#39;s literally TRILLIONS of galaxies that may have independent properties than ours, it&#39;s naive to say we know ANYTHING about the cosmos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you still might like it. It&#39;s kind of a great way to have your cake and eat it too. Watch some wild speculation on aliens in ancient times and it&#39;s also funny to see how easily the omission of an obvious solution can allow for run away spin and narrative. Boosts your BS decorator and also helps you sift down to the truly bizarre historical objects and events that are not yet locked down into a mainstream conclusion. </p>

<p>Plenty of mystery to uncover out their, but it&#39;s good to pull the weeds too.   </p>

<p>I suspect anything transportable found at digs gets taken away never to see the light of day again. Museums are filled with whatever fits the narratives.

<p>I&#39;ve occasionally wondered if there was an advanced ancient civilization (technology moderately more sophisticated than ours) and they experienced an extinction event that shattered their civilization, is it possible that it could have taken long enough to regain civilization that it would explain the loss of archaeological evidence for their advanced civilization?  Like would 50,000 years be enough? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think about it, if we ourselves were wiped out, how long would it take before everything we have, all evidence of our existence turns to dust? It wouldn&#39;t even take that long before the metals rust away, and all the wood and other soft materials turn to dirt, the concrete and rocks broken down to dust. It would be a blink of a cosmic eye before most evidence of us would be gone forever. </p>

<p>And yet there may be ample evidence of such a long lost civilization right under our noses: the Grand Canyon could have been a giant quarry, the butte rocks sawed off giant trees, the sands of the Sahara and other deserts the piles of waste deposited by some long lost people with unimaginably large machines, the imprints of machines, buildings, and vehicles in rocks, rocks themselves seemingly manufactured/formed by some unimaginable technology (the theories of channels such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqLPTe6eEeBP10Zhu5p-0cQ">newearth</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thc682132">Wiseup</a>, and others). These and many more examples need not be alien or natural, but could conceivably be from a very, very ancient civilization. Their metal long rusted away, their bones and buildings to dust. Everything in this reality is cyclic. I don&#39;t see why civilizations and life itself wouldn&#39;t be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s also possible that archaeological evidence could just be overlooked or disregarded, not even as part of a conspiracy but simply out of bias to existing theories and assumptions.  I&#39;d imagine small things turn up which contradict the accepted narrative but are disregarded as just expected anomalies or just disregarded because they conflict too much with the accepted narrative.</p>

<p>My larger problem is that I think that advanced cities/cultures would be using advanced materials science for their building materials and that these would be less prone to leave absolutely no trace.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what exactly would happen to the foundation structures of modern cities, for example, even after thousands of years, especially with some kind of protective layer of ash on top from some kind of extinction event.  Would they be completely unrecognizable after 50,000 years?</p>

<p>I guess a better way of phrasing it is how long does it take for nature to literally dissolve a city like NYC so that not even archaeological evidence remains? 50,000 years? 100,000 years?  What about finding relics created out of advanced materials designed to inhibit environmental decay?   Does this happening also require actual geological processes (flooded with magma or something)?</p>

<p>Since you can&#39;t be bothered with more than a few moments of focus, try browsing through the top 100 folder and  then come up with some terrestrial examples matching them. Shouldn&#39;t be too hard, right? I&#39;ll wait.</p>

<p>I honestly believe this is true. Its pre-history, so its not like there&#39;s a concrete way to say &quot;no thats not possible&quot;. I also tend to think &quot;the nephilim&quot; referred to in the bible are the same thing as the annunaki extra terrestrials.</p>

<p>We know this today.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Stone Henge and the Pyramids could be recreated today. Look at the Luxor in Las Vegas. Seriously, there&#39;s nothing in the known ancient world that we aren&#39;t able to create today. We might not know how they did it with our understanding of their understanding of the world, but that doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t capable to recreate it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They depicted helicopters, jet planes, spaceships, computers, other intelligent species, and firearms all over their walls “without ever seeing or wielding them”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much more than just depicting them, we have all of these technologies today. So they were not more advanced than us. Just because they were able to imagine these inventions doesn&#39;t mean they had them. Look at any Sci-Fi movie to see all the things we depict that very well might exist in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to mention all the tales of magical Kingdoms, the explorations, El Dorado, Hyperborea, Agartha, Lemuria, Atlantis, the list goes on and on. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>El Dorado supposedly had gold. Lemuria supposedly existed, no advanced technology. Atlantis supposedly had technology that while not more advanced than today was certainly much more advanced than other cultures. Donno about the others. Regardless, even if Atlantis existed it doesn&#39;t prove your thesis.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve provided no evidence that previous generations were more advanced than we are today. The evidence you&#39;ve proved would be more fitting for the argument &quot;Previous generations, while no more advanced than we are today, were more advanced than we thought they were.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I specifically said your question was very broad and picked 1 topic. Like, yes extremely deep caves, rain forests, and a giant frozen fucking continent pose their own challenges and risk to explore.</p>

<p>They&#39;re extremely remote and difficult to get to. Seems logical to me, but I&#39;m not the one sitting here going &quot;how do you know&quot; in response to a question that pressure is very high at extreme depths and denying space exists or what ever shit you subscribe to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cool? That&#39;s not &quot;space travel&quot;, now is it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>?? You didn&#39;t state you were comparing religion to space travel and exploration you simply made an analogy between space and religion. Might want to be more clear while you&#39;re busy moving those goal posts around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we specifically talk about our Oceans for example, well they&#39;re extremely deep and its much easier to deal with the vacuum of space than it is to deal with the pressure that exists at extreme depths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you know?</p>

<p>Are you seriously about to sit there and fucking argue against physics....</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure</a></p>

<p>Well, let’s see if we can work this one out. First, we have to understand how pressure is measured. If we were to take a one inch column of air all the way up through the atmosphere, it would weigh 14.7 pounds. For this reason, we like to say that the standard air pressure (at sea level) is 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). Water weighs more than this, though. Each one inch column that’s one foot deep will weigh 0.445 pounds.</p>

<p>So if you’re right at sea level, the pressure will be 14.7 psi. And for every foot you go underwater, you add another 0.445 psi. So at one foot deep, the pressure would be 14.7 psi + 0.445 psi = 15.145 psi. And at two feet deep it would be 14.7 psi + 2<em>(0.445 psi) = 15.59 psi, etc. In order to get to 2 atmospheres worth of air pressure, you would need to get to the point where there’s 29.4 psi (2 times 14.7 psi). To get to 29.4 psi, it turns out that you would need to be 33 feet deep. (Since 14.7 psi + 33</em>0.445 psi = 29.4 psi.)</p>

<p>Again man you&#39;re free to believe what ever you want but, what are you gaining out of this? </p>

<p>Please do not respond unless you can specifically answer this question.</p>

<p>What does NASA and ours or any government gain by lying about space travel and exploration?</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that &quot;radiation&quot; isn&#39;t exactly some solid wall, as long as you mitigate and deal with potential risks you can actually travel through quite concentrated sources of radiation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the love of intellect and open minded inquiry, realize that a rock cannot be a box or a cabinet or a pipe. Nor do rectangular cave entrances occur naturally.  Fight against cognitive dissonance by asking yourself questions, such as, is there a single example of such things anywhere on earth?</p>

<p>Since you can&#39;t be bothered with more than a few moments of focus, try browsing through the top 100 folder and  then come up with some terrestrial examples matching them. Shouldn&#39;t be too hard, right? I&#39;ll wait.</p>
