<p>sure whatever you say.  by your rationale wishing for pedos to stop abusing children is bad because they might suffer in the process of preventing them from doing what they do.  sorry, doesn&#39;t wash.  context matters.  and your willful desire to interpret statements into a model of &quot;suffering is bad all the time&quot; is indicative of your lack of intellectual honesty, because such a model is inherently incomplete.  try again.  oh and i note you didn&#39;t answer the question - yet another indicator you&#39;re not interested in dialogue and more interested in perpetuating whatever strawman makes you happy.  cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can wish for justice, for example the pedophile going to jail, without wishing that he gets raped and tortured in prison. You could even be okay with the death penalty without wanting people to suffer. Also I&#39;m not sure what question you are referring to. Sometimes it&#39;s necessary for certain people to suffer for the good of society as a whole. That&#39;s not the same thing as wishing pain on people because you dislike their politics and reveling in the thought of how bad there going to get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m not a fan of unnecessary suffering.  and i&#39;m not a fan of a cause and effect reactionary kinda behaviour either.  but at a certain point when shit isn&#39;t moving in the direction it should optimally be moving, and there&#39;s a perceivable risk or inevitability of pattern, sometimes people need a kick in the ass.  how else does one express this?  sometimes the language needs to be sufficiently strong or else people just don&#39;t get it.  we have systems of gov that are not designed well, and are not designed to mutate manageably, and the cost of it is collective ability and a slide into stupidity and conformity.  i guess the question becomes are people ready to be responsible for themselves or will this responsibility be pushed upon them.  we have design choices we can implement today that will greatly improve our collective confusion with gov.  but we don&#39;t do them.  maybe it&#39;s because we don&#39;t have the right values instilled, and fixing our gov would just prematurely eject humanity into a future it&#39;s not ready for.  that would seem the only reason i can think of as a reason for not improving.  but even in that scenario i can envision a better design that will help untangle the idiot public discourse we got going on.  not moving in that direction seems pretty fucking dumb.  and a reset seems eveb dumber.   probably didn&#39;t answer any of your questions here.  c&#39;est la vie.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s a good question..  how to discern.  it&#39;s like this..imagine you have a roadway and people haven&#39;t figured out that it&#39;s more optimal for people moving in one direction to stay on one side and those moving in the other direction to stay on the other side.  once you figure that out you can discern a &quot;better&quot; design, because it performs the function of moving more efficiently and predictably.  so similar to this you just look at a design and see how it will eventually go, and then you compare that to your set of human values (empathy, etc) and ask yourself which one would i prefer, and the answer tends to show itself somewhat clearly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Republic may be beginning to fracture but we aren&#39;t quite a failed state. We are on the road towards becoming one, more and more everyday, but there is still a window of opportunity, only about 5-10 years, in which we might be able to turn things around. </p>

<p>The author of this article seems to be more worried about fascism and genocide- I think he isn&#39;t seeing the bigger picture. When we are talking about American <em>collapse</em> we&#39;re not just talking about the death of the Republic, we&#39;re talking <em>social</em> collapse. The cessation of internal trade, food shipments, law and order, and a complete dissolution of self government. That&#39;s the real end to all of this if nothing is done, not fascism, but total societal collapse.</p>

<p>If a &quot;capitalist&quot; country has a centrally-planned economy, ubiquitous corporate welfare, lobbyists in every corner of government, a plethoric military-industrial complex, negative interest rates, more regulation than anywhere in the world, the most undecipherable laws in human history .... then I agree &quot;capitalism&quot; is bad.

    <div class="md"><p>But even with vigilance you can not prevent large corporations to form, and since they are unregulated they will be MUCH more vicious than even todays worst examples (eg Monsanto, Bayer, Goldman Sachs, Blackwater etc etc.). So you will end up with a few large corporations &#39;ruling&#39; over everybody with an iron fist, i.e. full fascism/authoritariansim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand this position, it is reasonable, but I disagree somewhat. I think the mega-evil-corporations we see today exist <em>because</em> the big government grants them all kinds of privileges; public contracts &amp; corporate welfare of course, but also a monopoly on ideas (patent laws), special access to credit, regulatory capture, indirect subsidies, etc. </p>

<p>They wouldn’t nearly have the same size/power if they had to compete against actual innovators, who are currently discriminated against. And you see, in countries with big governments the mega-corporations are king, in small countries with limited institutions the SMEs typically form the backbone of the economy.</p>

<p>The truth is that at the apex of power, the private sector, public sector and organized crime converge. To reduce the power of any 3, and to favor the rule of law, one must start by reducing the power of the State. The State is the number #1 serial killer in history, by a very long shot, and the principal enabler of injustice, inequality, misery and war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with some parts, but not that you must reduce the power of the state. If you do that, the power vacuum will simply be taken over by (big) corporations and they will grow bigger and take on the role of the government.</p>

<p>If the is little or no government, then corporations will of course keep on merging (even more so!), so this will crate even bigger mega-corps. Currently the only thing limiting the mega-corps from becoming giga-corps is anti-trust/anti-monopoly laws.</p>

<p>If there is no government to award big contracts, then how will big projects get off the ground? Like, say, a bridge? <em>someone</em> has to at some point decide who gets to build it. If big corporations are just allowed to build whatever they want, then it will be a mess (look at places like Costa del Sol in Spain, where rampant corruption basically allowed building without permits, it&#39;s a complete mess).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The choice isn&#39;t between no government and a plethoric State, IMO.</p>

<p>Decentralized, localized governance, that is the answer. Communities can band together and have solidarity, or devise rules to outlaw fraud. They can also build roads/bridges, organize garbage collection, plow the snow, and finance public schools.</p>

<p>Also such government would not be coercitive, as people would be free not to join into the social contract, and either live on their own or establish/join another community a bit farther away.</p>

<p>The more power is centralized, the bigger it becomes, the more corruption there is. That is unfortunately an axiom of human nature; power corrupts.</p>

<p>I think the key is in the caricature: the fat banker, cigar in mouth, who bribes politicians, profits from wars, enjoys a license to counterfeit money, and defrauds workers/producers through usury. He is not a consequence of liberty (or the so-called &quot;free-market&quot;), but rather of big government and the monopolistic privileges in grants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I guess it depends whether “capital” means savings (i.e. condensed labor) or debt.</p>

<p>But your comment shows IMO most well-intended people would agree, if only they agreed on vocabulary. </p>

<p>Typically we both agree with my list above, and with the fact it is undesirable. Therefore the only dichotomy between us is semantical.</p>

<p>Thus my attempt to generally use un-ambiguous words; that is why I avoid that particular one. I prefer speaking in terms of liberty vs tyranny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And why do people think it has to be all or nothing, one or the other? Other developed countries seem to have figured out a decent balance between a socialized safety net and a capitalistic consumer goods and service market. </p>

<p>Federalization of the US has destroyed what was supposed to be laboratories of democracy. There&#39;s no social experimentation going on here, just manipulation toward an increasingly centralized and extractive oligarchy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no inequality of malaise in the US.    Both affluent and poor are affected.    Its a mass insanity on parallel with the mass insanity of those who were caught up in the Third Reich,  its what the Third Reich would have looked like in 50 years if it had won.</p>

<p>In a strange roundabout way,  the Third Reich <em>did</em> win,   the American boys who went over there and came back brought it back with them,   with a bunch of former Nazis,   set them up in the CIA and the State Department,  and continued their work,   and continue it yet today with some very strange twists such as an incestuous marriage to the new Zionists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll grant that when people are free, they become prosperous; when they&#39;re prosperous, they become complacent; when they&#39;re complacent, they let the collectivism and the tyranny creep in.</p>

<p>In don&#39;t know the solution to this vicious cycle. Perhaps strong spiritual grounding? If people always put <em>morality</em> ahead of <em>utility</em>, this wouldn&#39;t happen.</p>
