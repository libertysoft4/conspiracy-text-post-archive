<p>33k die from the flu every year</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember now, we&#39;ve been saying 36,000 people die each year from the flu.  When we&#39;ve asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for updated figures, they told us 36K was the best they had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NPR said 37 as of today. These stories would be remotely believable if they dug a bit deeper and provided stats on this time last year and the rate of diagnosis. They don’t - they would if it supported their fear mongering. CDC records deaths due to flu even if the patient died of pneumonia (which is a large number of cases especially in the elderly). In other words, flu figures are bogus and if they aren’t (they are) they remain insignificant in the grand scheme of things. </p>

<p>Without perspective, no number means anything, really. 3,000+ ppl per day die in car wrecks.......</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly!</p>

<p>Below is how the CDC justify artificially inflating their flu deaths, most of which are really pneumonia which is a very common cause of death in people who were already close to death. They inflate the deaths to help sell the vaccine.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm</a></p>

<p>&quot;CDC does not know exactly how many people die from seasonal flu each year.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Why does CDC estimate deaths associated with seasonal flu?&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;CDC feels it is important to convey the full burden of seasonal flu to the public. Seasonal flu is a serious disease that causes illness, hospitalizations, and deaths every year in the United States. CDC estimates of annual influenza-associated deaths in the United States&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;What categories does CDC use to estimate flu-associated deaths?</p>

<p>CDC uses two categories of underlying cause of death information listed on death certificates: pneumonia and influenza (P&amp;I) causes and respiratory and circulatory (R&amp;C) causes. CDC uses statistical models with records from these two categories to make estimates of influenza-associated mortality.&quot;</p>

<p>Here <a href="http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/research/pi-trend-report.pdf">http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/research/pi-trend-report.pdf</a> we get to see exactly how many of the deaths were really caused by Influenza</p>

<p>e.g. In 1999 the pneumonia deaths were 62,065 and influenza just 1,665</p>

<p>e.g.2. In 2010 the pneumonia deaths were 49,597 and influenza 274</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse my ignorance on the subject, but I&#39;m confused on how can the flu kill and why it&#39;s making such a big impact all of a sudden. Does it make you more susceptible to pathogens by weakening your immune system? Is there a new strain of influenza going around i.e. swine flu 2.0? All opinions/answers welcomed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of problem is that any death from respiratory infection is reported as flu, even if it was not tested, or if it was known to be pneumonia, for example. </p>

<p>For another, this years flu vaccine is only 10% effective, and if you get it, it will make you susceptible to other strains of flu, and it will prevent you acquiring natural immunity. </p>

<p>Past studies have shown an increase in deaths from flu in the elderly ever since widespread vaccination has been done, not less. Children admitted to hospital for flu are more likely to die from it if they were vaccinated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I see. So it&#39;s being used as a blanket cause for more serious illnesses. </p>

<p>So what&#39;s the purpose of getting the vaccine if it&#39;s only 10% effective, but at the same raising your chances of getting another strain of the flu? Also begs the question, why is being pushed so hard this year? </p>

<p>Seems like something sinister is going on.</p>
