    <div class="md"><p>We can&#39;t possible know for sure. I think that certain theoretical advancements have shown that, at least relatively, <em>forward</em> time travel should be possible...travelling at light speed for a period of time would seem far shorter for those at that speed than for those on the ground, so to speak. You could travel at light speed for an entire year and age accordingly, but when you land back on Earth 50 years could have passed...relative to them. </p>

<p>Going backwards is the trick though...because that requires reversing Entropy, which as far as we know is a fundamental aspect of the Universe itself, and would require a lot more rule breaking (unless the rule book is completely wrong). </p>

Also when I was about 15 I agreed with my friend that if either of us obtained access to a time machine that we&#39;d travel back to that exact moment and I have no recollection of meeting either of our future selves so it must not be possible :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would. It fits the bill. Pilot gets in a machine and travels fifty years in one year. The only thing that is different is that there is an exchange. One must still experience time, just faster. And its a one way ticket. </p>

<p>The real interesting realm of science fiction is going backwards in time. Which usually stories that have that kind of time travel are more about an ethereal universe, where time doesnt actually exist and is a dimension that can be sidestepped. Which makes sense if you try to imagine a 5th dimension.  A being born within the 4th dimension is straddled to the cap rules of the 4th dimension, but not constricted completely by the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd dimensions. So theoritically, a being born to the 5th dimension would abide by rules that supercede the previous ones but not completely. Meaning stepping through time in any direction could be possible. </p>

<p>I would definitely say that i find the evidence lacking. But its just possible we dont know what to look for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>time travel as we conventionally perceive it? example: going back in time and killing hitler. no. </p>

<p>there are many paradoxes to overcome with time travel, especially into the past, if you travel into the past and interact with it, you&#39;re inevitably changing the &#39;future&#39; of the past you just went back to however if you change the future the series of events that led to you being in a time machine to go back into the past wouldn&#39;t have happened thus how are you able to make changes? </p>

<p>when marty mcfly goes back to 1955 he makes so many changes to history that when he returns his life and family are almost 180 degree different, meaning marty returned to a period of reality that was not his, in that reality he may not have even been friends with doc brown. </p>

<p>i think there are endless realities endless possibilities endless variation, every choice for everyone everywhere all of every instance of reality existing simultaneously and that there is a way to move from one possibility to the next. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we are all traveling forward in time at 1 hour per hour. But to instead move ahead thousands of years ahead you would need to travel at or beyond the speed of light which is not yet possible by us on Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure that teaching the speed of light 1C by conventional acceleration (which would take an enormous amount of energy) would by relativity cause time to freeze (a poor way of wording it) for everything outside of your relative reality.  Approaching the speed of light say 0.09C would cause time to pass faster outside of your relative reality as in earth experienced 1000 years in what was 2 weeks inside your bubble.  100% of C would be a total freeze, infinite mass and would likely cause a proton to pop out of the event horizon boundary of the universe which would immediately start expanding (big bang style) into a brand new universe at hour 0.  Don&#39;t fuck around with 1C.</p>

<p>If time travel can ever possibly exist, it already does exist, in the future.  And if it does exist in the future, then time travelers from the future have undoubtedly come back to the past.

And if all of this is true, then they have had what is in essence an infinite amount of time to alter the past and shape a future of their choosing.  And there is nothing you can do about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Traveling toward in time is possible. If objects have enough mass, time will slow down when near them. If you were to stand near the Great Pyramid of Gza, time will slow down for you compared to people standing away from it a mile away. The time distance were talking about here is so minuscule though, it won&#39;t actually be perceived. However, if an object is really massive, like a super massive black hole, then time would really slow down for you if you were near it. If you orbited a black hole for like a few weeks or months and returned to earth, then years would have passed by on earth, even though it was just weeks, or months for you.</p>

<p>Another way to actually travel toward in time is if there was a train fast enough to circle around the earth near the speed of light. If you rode that train for a few weeks or months or whatever, years would have passed for everyone on earth. Not sure the calculations or how many years would have gone by but it&#39;s significant. Like weeks for you on that train, a few years for everyone on earth. </p>
