<p>its also interesting to note that the &quot;high speed photography&quot; claim and/or debunking seems to exist nowhere but in this video. however the man in this video would have you believe that it is the centerpiece for all &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; </p>

<p>its a red herring, a straw man. an argument that he made up, just so that he could tear it down</p>

<p>this video is so bad that it smells like low budget satire, but people continue to cite this video as if its proof that men went to the moon</p>

<p>there is no need for reflectors, since MIT had been measuring the distance to the moon with a laser since 1962 </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>thats the beauty of true science. unless you can replicate it per the scientific method, it can be dismissed as pseudo scientific nonsense </p>

<p>have you personally replicated/confirmed the placement of these reflectors? no? </p>

<p>have you ever met anyone who has claimed to have replicated/confirmed the placement of these reflectors? no?</p>

<p>could you differentiate between a laser hitting the moon surface, and a laser hitting a reflector? no?</p>

<p>just a little physics lesson to wrap this up</p>

<p>a telescope is made &quot;to gather light&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope</a></p>

<p>a laser is a focused beam of light which does not follow the inverse square law</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser</a></p>

<p>so, according to NASA, we have the technology to use a highly focused beam of light, to hit a small moving target at 200,000 miles away </p>

<p>and yet we do not have the technology to use a telescope to find that exact same small moving target on the moon, supposedly because its too far away or moving too fast?</p>

<p>if we actually had the technology to make a laser track the movement of the moon, so that the laser could hit the reflector, then would a reflector even be necessary? 1962</p>

<p>24 more math and physics questions debunk this moon landing myth </p>

<p>The angular resolution of a telescope is roughly equal to wavelength / aperture diameter. You&#39;d need an enormous telescope to be able to even see the lunar landing site. </p>

<p>A laser is something totally different because it&#39;s <em>coherent</em> light. </p>

<p>So yes we can hit something hundreds of thousands of miles away without being able to see it. It&#39;s simple math. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Ultimate proof though, is that the USSR never called out the US</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been debating the facts of the moon landing for decades, and almost without fail, people will claim that &quot;muh Russians would have told me&quot;</p>

<p>this argument has caught my attention for several reasons </p>

<p>1) its so popular that it has to be an idea that comes from the top-down, as opposed to lots of random people simultaneously coming up with the same argument. so I&#39;m curious where this argument originated, and why it seems plausible enough to regurgitate </p>

<p>2) I&#39;m always curious how the person making the argument &quot;knows&quot; that the Russians <em>didn&#39;t</em> call bullshit. was that person monitoring Russian media in the 1960-1970&#39;s?</p>

<p>3) I&#39;m always curious how the person making the argument would expect the Russians to alert them to the fact that the moon landing was a hoax. Would the Russians hack into our Emergency Alert System and play a recording of Russians calling bullshit? Would the Russians take out a full page ad in the NYT? Would the Russians send a singing telegram to your house?</p>

<p>oh i know! you would expect the same TV station that just got done putting all of that effort into fooling you into believing men walked on the moon, to drop the facade at the first hint of Russian skepticism, and admit on national prime time TV that the moon landing was indeed a hoax and gosh darn it they would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn&#39;t for those meddling Russians  </p>

<p>oh and then theres this:</p>

<p>My point is that the USSR had every incentive to prove the US wrong. They already did it with the U-2 incident and would have loved to catch the US with its pants down by proving that they never actually went to the moon.</p>

<p>Has absolutely nothing to do with who was the good guys and who were the bad guys (whatever that means).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a shit about who was right and who was wrong. But humans did set foot on the moon and there is a lot of evidence of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>may i ask if you remember when you first heard this &quot;muh Russians&quot; argument? </p>

<p>i suspect there was a moon landing hoax debunking video on the History Channel on TV and it included this argument</p>

<p>the cold war narrative further crumbles when you realize that in the 45+ years its been since anyone has even claimed to have walked on the moon,</p>

<p>that the quest to put men on the moon still consists of just 2 parties</p>

<p>1) the Americans, who have been there, and done that. and felt so confident about doing it that they copied over the landing data, deleted footage, and basically &quot;lost&quot; the technology to go to the moon</p>

<p>2) the Russians, who were at one point supposedly more advanced with their manned programs, yet inexplicably still unable to put men on the moon in spite of 45+ years of Moore&#39;s Law  </p>

<p>this silly mock-up of Russians vs Americans, completely ignores the fact that no other nation has been able to go to the moon, in spite of there being many technologically advanced nations who would presumably go if they they thought that they could</p>

<p>the scientific method requires replication </p>

<p>photocopying your own data 7 times is not credible replication </p>

<p>this answer is why the argument in question is so interesting to me.</p>

<p>its seems that theres a formula for fake news that goes something like this:</p>

<p>MSM fake news: men walked on the moon today</p>

<p>&quot;alt&quot; fake news: 10 reasons why people who don&#39;t believe men walked on the moon are wrong</p>

<p>fake news consumer: ill just let these 10 reasons supplant my own thinking and reasoning, and pretend I&#39;m smart and capable of critical thinking.   </p>

<p>critical thinker: the moon landing hoax defies the laws of physics </p>

<p>fake news consumer: the physics are so easy</p>

<p>critical thinker: well that explains why the Russians still haven&#39;t walked on the moon </p>

<p>fake news consumer: butt hurt Russians mothballed their lunar programs</p>

<p>its like, you can&#39;t get very far into a debate without the entire narrative collapsing </p>
