<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/search?q=%22conspiracy+of+silence%22&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;t=all">https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/search?q=%22conspiracy+of+silence%22&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;t=all</a></p>

<p>The current version seems to have been removed accidentally then restored a while later, but with such an oft-submitted documentary, I don&#39;t think you should read anything malicious into it.</p>

<p>One of the problems with this documentary is that when it is posted to YouTube, the video itself is often taken down due to copyright claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was removed without citing the rule it broke, that&#39;s shady, and bad moderating. </p>

<p>Also, a common tactic is to remove posts that are riding the karma train, and let them be resubmitted. This prevents them from getting widely viewed and all you have to do is say &quot;oops, automod fucked up&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Citing the rule that was violated prevents further rule violations, and also prevents &quot;why&#39;d you remove my post, you fascists!&quot; messages. It also prevents community conjecture, this post being a prime example. And again, the karma train derail trick isn&#39;t to remove content, just to stop it from getting popular. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best subs have clear rules, consistent enforcement of those rules, and transparency when those rules are enforced. When you don&#39;t do that, subs tend to go to shit. </p>

<p>Also, let&#39;s not pretend that <a href="/r/Documentaries">/r/Documentaries</a> is some super high traffic sub. ~30 posts in the last 24hrs, and you guys have 11 moderators. It&#39;s not like you&#39;re working a fulltime job moderating a sub like that. If it was a sub like <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> or something, I&#39;d have more pity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even with 2 active mods, <a href="/r/Documentaries">/r/Documentaries</a> is not that active of a sub to create a large workload. Furthermore, it takes less than 10 seconds to write up a single line stating what rule was violated causing the post to be removed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would think that&#39;s the case, and I thought the same before, but if you have a real job and other things in your life that take up time, and if you mod other subs, there isn&#39;t a whole lot of time, especially if you&#39;re monitoring the comments of each submission, checking the spam folder, refreshing the page once in a while, and participating on Reddit elsewhere. It&#39;s hard to justify spending more time moderating and double checking everything to make sure it&#39;s all perfect than posting comments elsewhere as you otherwise would because moderation is voluntary. </p>

<p>The most amount of time spent is probably verifying that each post is not breaking rules. For a documentary sub, the mods would have to watch at least some portion of each documentary to verify that it doesn&#39;t break any rules. </p>

<p>I forget to do things myself as well. I also usually won&#39;t inform the user that I removed their post if I believe they are a spammer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If writing up a 10sec explanation is too much work, you should probably lower the amount of subs you&#39;re moderating. Again, I know that moderating is a volunteer position, but it&#39;s one that moderators choose to do, and subscribers rely on them to do a good job. If you can&#39;t devote the amount of attention necessary due to other obligations, either don&#39;t do it, or cut back on other obligations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said before, most mods have motivation in the beginning and end up stopping completely. If a mod does a decent job of taking care of the sub, a minor mistake like that does not justify telling them that they need to sacrifice even more free time to make everyone happy 100 percent of the time. Any of the other mods could have informed the OP about the removal justification, but we don&#39;t know how many of them are actually active. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have X time to moderate subs, and you divide it by Y total subs you&#39;re moderating, if that ratio doesn&#39;t provide enough time to properly moderate a sub, then you either need to raise X or lower Y. I&#39;m not advocating raising X, I&#39;m saying lower Y. </p>

<p>&quot;I have too many other things to worry about&quot;, then don&#39;t mod, or don&#39;t do the other things. </p>

<p>I would see this all the time in small businesses as well. People would take every job they could get, then they&#39;d have to half-ass all the jobs they took because they didn&#39;t have enough time to devote to all of them, and then they get a bad reputation for their work. </p>

<p>Either cut down on the amount of jobs you take, or hire more help. It doesn&#39;t excuse doing a poor job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not defending moderating 250 subs, but if we&#39;re talking about the same mod, the vast majority of the subs they moderate have very little activity. </p>

<p>There are two subs that I check once a month or less because I haven&#39;t found enough time to work on bringing traffic to them. I assume that a lot of mods have stuff on the back burner. </p>

<p>The amount of subs doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they don&#39;t have enough time to do a decent job modding the highest traffic subs. Criticizing them for minor mistakes also takes time away from moderation as well because they have to explain things to people who think they are useless or modding for nefarious purposes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually not true. I used to think I would make zero mistakes as well, so I get it. Even if you do a perfect job, there are plenty of people out there who will cook up some crazy theory about the mods.

I&#39;ve had people claim I work for Hillary Clinton because I had to remove a post. it&#39;s really doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re perfect or not. There will be the occasional highly upvoted posts in other subs claiming you are a shill or whatever.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like the documentary almost invalidates the notion that pedogate is a false, partisan-fueled witch hunt, and rather shows that there&#39;s a programmatic method to suppressing information about ritual abuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would never call a free thinker such as yourself a “libtard”. I’d save that for the people who can’t think outside of their parties talking points (republicans have the same problem). Pedogate is very real and I’m glad you’re spreading the word!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. It&#39;s an extremely important documentary. It was pulled from network TV right before it was to air, for anyone who doesn&#39;t know. Some copies got out and were posted online. So it&#39;s been all grassroots internet proliferation.</p>

<p>Try again in a couple weeks? </p>

<p>Acknowledging the reality of elite pedophilia really exposes the world we&#39;re living in and makes people stop and think.</p>
