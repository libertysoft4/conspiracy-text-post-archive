<p>Get two stakes and two laser pointers and two bubble levels. Affix lasers to top of stakes and levels atop the lasers.</p>

<p>Then you should be able to point the lasers at one another and they should point directly to each other if the earth is flat since gravity pulls strait down.</p>

<p>You might need a piece of paper behind so you have something to shoot the laser at.</p>

<p>If earth is round then as you get a couple thousand feet apart gravity should cause the lasers to point slightly up rather than straight at each other.</p>

<p>Either way a hill or mountain would maybe block the laser so you need to fin somewhere flat or ideally a canyon. </p>

<p>Would this work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn’t about surfaces. The lasers will both be pointing through the open air. This is about gravity being mostly uniform. If the earth is flat and gravity always pulls down then the lasers should point exactly to each other if the stakes are level. If it’s round then they should point slightly up once get far enough apart.</p>

<p>I think this would be a way for you to disprove flat earth on your own and you can observe it yourself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically, the earth is a polygon not a sphere.  It has LOTS of differently shaped surfaces.  It&#39;s so large though, perspective from space it is round.  Gravity will bend light, it&#39;s how we get the Northern Lights, but a laser, with a source at the surface of the earth, will continue is a straight path until it is interrupted (mountain, wall, cow, tree) the laser would, in theory, consistently travel further off the surface of the earth as it travels in its path. So if you shoot a laser at a barn, laser being level to the ground, and you are 5&#39; away - the laser should be 5&#39; up the barn (off the ground). If you were able to travel 100 miles away and were able to clear a path to the barn and again shot the laser 5&#39; off the ground, the laser should be slightly higher or perhaps above the barn at this point. Take a basketball. Take a peice oof paper. Lay the paper on top the ball, the paper represents the path of the laser if shot level to the earth&#39;s surface. Eventually the laser travels AWAY from earth, proving its roundness </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont understand the “at the beach”. Because if the earth is a sphere than it wouldnt matter if you were at the beach or in your backyard...but i think youre just not realizing just how large of a ball we live on tbh. The earth is so massive that you wouldnt see curvature like youre assuming you should. Look at video blogs on the ISS and watch when they point the camera outside. Even at hundreds of miles up you dont see the curvature so dramatically, its like being an ant on a ball the size of a major city. Its not like having your fingers stand on a basketball.</p>

<p>so being on a commercial flight takes you up around 30,000 feet, at 30,000 how much of your state (assuming youre in the US) do you see? Surely not everything....so how much higher would you need to go to see across youre whole entire state? Surely at least double right? Now imagine how high up youd need to be to see half the US, or even all of it in just your eyes without moving you head. Now imagine you see all the US, mexico, some of south america, and a huge chunk if the oceans all in one view....that much surely be pretty high up wouldnt you agree?

    <div class="md"><p>Ah ya altitude could be a problem. You wouldn’t need a flat surface though. A canyon would work well since you could see all the way across it.</p>

<p>A bubble level and a couple $50 lasers would do the trick though. Even if you can’t ensure equal altitude, you could still see that the lasers are not parallel as they would be on a flat earth. They would both point slightly up. Someone standing between them and a ways away perpendicular could see this. A foggy night would be ideal.</p>

<p>You don’t have to go super far or be super precise to observe gravity. Curvature of earth is 8 inches per mile. You can stand at two street lights and observe whether the lasers are parallel.</p>

<p>Pretty sure the worlds biggest fountain or swimming pool has to account for this as well. But I can’t find the story on it now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL;DR: Take your height above the ground, multiply by 2 * PI, then divide by 24.  This will give you the speed the ground will rotate faster than you per hour.  It works for any units (Inches, Meters, Miles, etc.).</p>

<p>Yes it does... kinda.</p>

<p>If you imagine yourself in contact with the earth, you rotate once around the earth every day.  As you travel upward, you keep that horizontal velocity (after all, what would have sped you up or slowed you down), but you&#39;re tracing a larger circle.  That means you&#39;ll start lagging behind the ground below you.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it&#39;s not hard to find out how much you&#39;re lagging behind.  Every foot you rise up, you gain 2 * PI feet in the circle you&#39;re tracing (about 6.25).  That&#39;s the size difference in the circle you trace in 24 hours, which means you&#39;ll be that far behind after a day at that altitude.  So, you can divide that amount by 24 to find the difference in speed per hour.</p>

<p>I dont follow... Look into &quot;reference Frames&quot; </p>

<p>If you are on a plane and jump in the aisle do you fly to the back of the plane at 600mph??</p>

<p>No because you the plane and everything in it are all moving the exact same speed. </p>

<p>Same when the plane is flying. Its moving the same speed as the planet when its on the ground, right?</p>

<p>Where does that speed go when it takes off?&gt;</p>

<p>What you are suggesting is akin to jumping in the plane aisle and hitting the back wall. </p>

<p>Coriolis isnt just about speed. Its about the speed the object is at at the equator (For example) and then higher or lower than the equator. </p>

<p>If you are on a merry go round the outside is moving faster than the center, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What’s the deal with this “level” thing? Someone else made a big deal about having <strong>a level surface</strong>, but I thought it was obvious that having a level surface isn’t important. I asked them and they didn’t say why they thought it was important. I even said a canyon would work. Canyons aren’t level at all, in fact being not level is kind of a requirement to have a canyon. Why do you think having a level surface is important? How do you think this experiment is going to work? Maybe my description of the experiment didn’t make much sense or something, because someone else asked this same question.</p>

The Suns electromagnetic field charges all of the noble gas that natural separates and condenses at higher altitudes causes the argon etc to make the blue to orange spectrum you see.

    <div class="md"><p>yeah more or less.  the bedford experiment worked as a model also because water would find level.  so if you use that as your ground and square from that you&#39;d have a decent level.  but there are even more basic experiments you can do and that&#39;s just go to a body of water a known distance away from a landmark that shouldn&#39;t be visible and see if you can see it.  there will be localized refraction along the way but if it&#39;s a fairly consistent temp/humidity along the way (and you don&#39;t need to go that far out - 3 miles is sufficient) you can estimate that the refraction error that would happen.  this is why there are so many examples of this experimental model being performed that show no curvature.  it took 50+ years for the refraction explanation to arise as a potential reason for error, but even after this there were experiments done demonstrating it was not a reproduceable result.  another test you can do, which is common sense, is to get a theodolite or some other leveled viewing instrument you can rotate on the level plane and see if you see curvature from one side to the other, as you should be able to see the peak in between.  fairly common sense ways to provide smells of validity.  and i reckon you&#39;ll find the curvature model doesn&#39;t seem to fit.</p>

<p>what the actual model is who knows.  all you can do is eliminate the ones that don&#39;t work.</p>

<p>First, it should be pretty obvious to everybody that holding the pendulum in your hand would cause it to shake and sway, because nobody can hold their hand steady enough to replace a mechanical support.  That being so extremely obvious has me 99% convinced that you aren&#39;t seeking the truth, but just making up strawman bullshit to support a retarded belief system,</p>

<p>Second, a Foucault pendulum is usually very massive, hundreds of pounds, because the pivot usually has a lot of friction for the precession force to overcome.  Holding a massive pendulum from your hand isn&#39;t practical.</p>

<p>I might not bother with further strawman arguments poised in the form of stupid questions.  That won&#39;t indicate anything wrong with my premise, just that I don&#39;t bother with educating the unwilling retard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to discuss the possibility of theoretical laser levels and what this would be like on paper is a hell of a lot different than attempting to do so in reality. </p>

<p>Try all you want it will not work with you kit being under 1000. </p>

<p>Using the tried and true method we did hundre
ds of years ago is adequate. </p>

<p>When they build a decent sized bridge they do not use a laser to &quot;see&quot; the marks. It is done on paper with math. </p>

<p>Look at survey crews one sees about town. They have pricey equipment and only do small bits at a time. The margin of error will grow exponentially when you get further away.</p>

<p>Just getting the little eye to line up on a garage door can be a bitch</p>

<p>And flat earth is a weak premise not even a passable hypothesis.</p>

<p>Gravity? </p>

<p>These lasers so far apart a mountain is in the way?</p>

<p>Why not with a theodolite? Small bits at a time. You can measure angles and see it just as well with math as a glowy red light.</p>

<p>The lasers don’t need to be that far away and a mountain wouldn’t be blocking them, or it wouldn’t work. That’s why something like a canyon would be good, but a road would work fine.</p>

<p>I dont follow... Look into &quot;reference Frames&quot; </p>

<p>If you are on a plane and jump in the aisle do you fly to the back of the plane at 600mph??</p>

<p>No because you the plane and everything in it are all moving the exact same speed. </p>

<p>Same when the plane is flying. Its moving the same speed as the planet when its on the ground, right?</p>

<p>Where does that speed go when it takes off?&gt;</p>

<p>What you are suggesting is akin to jumping in the plane aisle and hitting the back wall. </p>

<p>Coriolis isnt just about speed. Its about the speed the object is at at the equator (For example) and then higher or lower than the equator. </p>

<p>If you are on a merry go round the outside is moving faster than the center, right?</p>

<p>Same principle with bullets firing north or south.</p>
