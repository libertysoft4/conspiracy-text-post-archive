        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You are being lied to on a daily basis. Im not exaggerating when I say that most of humanity is in a deep hypnotic trance that makes it impossible to realize the truth. Everything your government feeds you is toxic. Your food is usually fake, processed and full of shit that you don’t even know exist. Most likely the food you buy for your family to eat comes with a list of ingredients on the back and it sounds like a chemistry set. But do you even read it? They put lead, fluoride, and chlorine in the water, then tell you, but do you still drink it? Oh so you want to eat healthy? Try these genetically modified fruits and vegetables we have for you! The education is also full of blatant lies and irrelevant bs to get you trained and used to working for the next 50 years til you die. Don’t want to work? Well no food for you then because you need these fictional pieces of paper we invented just to eat.  Oh and of course your television is brainwashing you. Have you ever actually paid attention to it? Have you ever woken up and just flipped through the channels and realized what the fuck is actually on there? Pure subliminal evil. Everything on tv is made with the sole intention of hypnotizing you into a docile state to not question the reality that you magically woke up in. Sad to say even my favorite cartoons like rick and morty, futurama, south park, have tons of subtile subliminal plot-lines which set you to a fixed streamline of narrow thinking. Usually, shows like this can either make the truth seem like a joke and only possible in a cartoon, but sometimes they can make you think just a tiny bit more about your existence. And last but not least, American politics is basically WWE for old people. Remember that time when donald trump shaved vinces head and got stone cold stunnered? Yeah thats exactly what id expect to see on cnn. What bothers me is that people can not see through the shell of what it is. OLD PEOPLE PRETENDING TO CARE ABOUT YOU, PLAY FIGHTING OVER FAKE LAWS THAT THEY DONT EVEN HAVE TO FOLLOW. Hillary is never going to jail for those emails if she hasn’t even gone to jail for stealing billions from HATI. Donald trump isn’t going to get impeached because he doesn’t really do anything anyway. The president is just a puppet to represent the people. The American people feel insulted to have such a president, well you fucking should because maybe now you will realize that our entire country is full of shit. </p>

<p>Sad thing is, this honestly isn’t even close to the tip of the ice berg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We humans are in a race, a DNA race, of becoming gods.To be fair all living creatures are in that race. You see what&#39;s happening to those other creatures. They have no chance with us lets be fair.</p>

<p>the mechanism for everyone is the same, evolution. What your ancestors did is what you are. what you do is what your offspring will be. </p>

<p>You can create less competition by letting others lie towards themself&#39;s. Over many generations will this create creatures that are blind to certain truths of nature. 
Like those other animals, they have no chance really. They live their lives in self build lies, generations old.</p>

<p>The biggest scam in the world </p>

<p>He dismantled a lot of their planned world government infrastructure. TPP, Paris climate, working on NAFTA, stopping the flood of replacement citizens.....He even went to the head of the globalists the world economic forum and pitched the financial benefits of having a free sovereign nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rick and Morty are helping to undo the brainwashing, by necessity that includes the same techniques as you are calling out. Excellent post and analysis though.</p>

<p>Look into trauma based mind control if you haven&#39;t already, hypnosis requires bypassing the critical factor, what these people are doing is very dark.</p>

<p>You might change your mind on Trump and HRC, maybe the conspiracy is even larger than you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as I love Rick and Morty, I must disagree. </p>

<p>Morty: </p>

<p>“Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody&#39;s gonna die; come watch TV.”</p>

<p>“Fuck you, fuck nature, and fuck trees”</p>

<p>Rick:</p>

<p>“My God’s the biggest dick that never existed”</p>

<p>“Listen Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people calls &quot;love&quot; is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.”</p>

<p>Just a couple example of the nihilistic, atheistic, pro-matrix messages this show delivers.</p>

<p>Trauma based mind control is very real. Having spent time on the Marines, I’ve experienced extreme versions of this and see it everywhere now. Especially in the media/entertainment world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on if you identify with rick or morty imo. But I agree the creators of the show havent fully sold out to the elite just yet. I believe one of the main reasons its so popular is because of how genuine the show and the characters feel. Rick also drops a lot of genius knowledge that can possibly have a slight impact on the public, But the subtle subliminal message of the show is to just not give a fuck. </p>

<p>As for the mind control and hypnosis yeah Im well aware of the horrible horrible things these people do to people and its sad. Also I know the conspiracy is pretty large and out of most peoples comprehension. Even the conspiracy community isn&#39;t ready to learn this information yet. And most have probably already dismissed it because some of it is so fucking crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;If you don&#39;t open your mind, and if you don&#39;t quit believing dogma, if you don&#39;t quit believing what people tell you, if you don&#39;t stop believing what Dan Rather tells you on the six o&#39;clock news, or your local minister down at your church, or your mother or the President of the United States, and if you don&#39;t start digging to find the truth yourself, you, you, the sheeple, are the marionettes, dancing while the invisible ones pull the strings. And until you change that pattern of your life, you will always be the puppet on the end of someone else&#39;s string. And I know that that&#39;s not what you want to be, is it? Well, if it&#39;s not, change your life now. Stop believing what you are told unless it checks out in your own research, your own experience, your own digging. Each of us must find our own truth, and if we are really looking and digging, we&#39;re ultimately going to come to something near the same truth for all of us. And I can tell you now that most of us have been living in fantasyland for all of our lives. We don&#39;t even know anything near what the truth of any matter is. And we must begin an honest search, starting from the beginning, wiping the slate clean, cleansing our mind, and looking at the world, beginning again as though through the eyes of a new-born child. And you will find that most of what you ever been taught in your entire life is a lie...is a lie.&quot;</p>

<p>School has always been but a factory to churn out workers—its very essence with the teachers (supervisors/bosses) and work and bells has always been to precondition the youth for an adult life of getting up every day to work. That, at least should be common sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where do they put lead into the water? OR could it be that the lead in the water comes from the pipes in which the water flows?</p>

<p>Also do some of the chemicals in the water, especially those in bigger reservoirs, reduce the bacterial growth. Imagine perhaps the water for such cities like NY or LA leaving without those ingredients, would there be a chance that this could cause dysentery and typhoid fever?</p>

<p>Well i understand being very sceptical about food and it&#39;s ingredients, that&#39;s why i favour biological produced food and mostly try to avoid the whole of industrial produced food, especially meat where a lot of medicals were used in the process of the feed up of the animals. Also there&#39;s a lot of stuff like flavor enhancers in food that doesn&#39;t belong there.</p>

<p>But i think you&#39;re portraying it a bit too easy and simple.</p>

<p>This is like, the first level of being woke? </p>

<p>This sub ised to discuss ways to filter water/gather rainwater, avoid purchasing from corporations, homesteading, bugout bags, and all manners of prepping that didn&#39;t link to InfoWars products. (I mean, ok, some of you were obsessed with Jesse Ventura...) </p>

<p>Is the baseline of this sub so wholly replaced that this stream of consciousness is a new idea? </p>

<p>These aren&#39;t processed either, these chemicals appear naturally in all types of foods, no matter if it&#39;s human-made or not. Chemicals aren&#39;t inherently bad, and just because you are not that familiar with them doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t good for you. </p>

<p>Have you heard of (5R)-[(1S)-1,2-Dihydroxyethyl]-3,4-dihydroxyfuran-2(5H)-one? That&#39;s Ascorbic Acid or Vitamin C and essential for your health. Or how about (3β,5Z,7E)-9,10-secocholesta- 5,7,10(19)-trien-3-ol? Also called Cholecalciferol or Vitamin D.</p>
