<blockquote>
<p>Speaking on Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the Hungarian businessman said that &quot;social-media companies influence how people think and behave without them even being aware of it,&quot; adding that they have &quot;far-reaching adverse consequences on the functioning of democracy, particularly on the integrity of elections.&quot;
Facebook&#39;s and Google&#39;s size, he argued, means they have become &quot;obstacles to innovation.&quot; He called for significantly more regulatory oversight of the companies, holding up the European Union competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, as a model that other regulators should emulate.</p>

<p>&quot;The fact that they are near-monopoly distributors makes them public utilities and should subject them to more stringent regulations aimed at preserving competition, innovation, and fair and open universal access,&quot; Soros said.</p>

<p>You can read his remarks at the bottom of this article.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;There could be an alliance between authoritarian states and these large, data-rich IT monopolies that would bring together nascent systems of corporate surveillance with an already developed system of state-sponsored surveillance,&quot; he said. &quot;This may well result in a web of totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The owners of the platform giants consider themselves the masters of the universe, but in fact, they are slaves to preserving their dominant position,&quot; he said. &quot;It is only a matter of time before the global dominance of the US IT monopolies is broken. Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered. Regulation and taxation will be their undoing, and EU Competition Commissioner Vestager will be their nemesis.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Arab spring was in 2010... it&#39;s pretty ignorant to think Social media had anywhere near the influence it does today.</p>

<p>In 2010 Facebook had 400 million users.</p>

<p>Now a little under a 1/3rd of the global population has Facebook (2.07 BILLION users).</p>

<p>Obviously a lot of those accounts are fake but that was also an issue in 2010 if not moreso since Facebook has more stringent (but still overall lax) verifications now.</p>

<p>Ignoring manipulation of news feeds by external forces, the nature of &quot;filter bubbles&quot; is an ever growing threat.</p>

<p>We (social media users at least) have their biases reinforced all day long on their feeds, we are served ads to our taste and articles we&#39;re likely to enjoy. Keeps us all happy and conformed - but doesn&#39;t allow valid debate or respectful discussion.</p>

<p>We seen on this forum daily the results - each &quot;side&quot; has a library of links and media to back them up, and the <em>facts</em> of whatever issue are quickly lost in emotional shouting matches.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure because it&#39;s old George saying this the comments will focus on how he&#39;s trying to manipulate us buy I think it&#39;s an important discussion.</p>

<p>Also, delete Facebook and twitter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s identified a problem (social media manipulation by state and non-state actors), the reaction promulgated by the media is self-evident, and the solution is undoubtedly more government regulation and involvement in social media. </p>

<p>I for one do not find it persuasive that the solution to massively manipulated institutions is to have other institutions, quite known to be doing much of the manipulation, to interfere and regulate. The solution must be decentralized and distributed social media channels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Facebook and Google enable populism. George Soros doesn&#39;t like that, because if populism took care of everything they wouldn&#39;t need his billions funding organizations that seek to start populist movements that promote his values and narratives.</p>

<p>The main narrative that Soros promotes is &quot;nationalism is racism&quot; and the corralary &quot;strong states are fascist&quot;. This is why he is unpopular with nationalist governments in Eastern Europe for example that reject EU immigration rules and why he attempts to undermine those government&#39;s legitimacy in Hungary for example. He can pay for media campaigns to support his positions and he can exert influence financially over media networks, but he can&#39;t control the masses on social media which thwart his vision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m sure he has a motive for this position, he&#39;s not wrong. The major social media platforms are capable of mass communication and populist organizing to an unprecedented degree, but it&#39;s so damn easy to co-opt and censor with state involvement. In some ways they project an illusion of democracy and community, and a lot of it has to do with their monopoly-like control and popularity. </p>

<p>And as far as social media contributing and outright generating anxieties and conditions in users, that&#39;s always been obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did provide a video, and it’s different when you ask about something you already researched that was confusing instead of the usual “uh I don’t believe you prove it to me” where I end up finding out an hour later that nothing could have convinced you otherwise.</p>

<p>People aren’t some information servants of yours here to provide you with fully sourced and well thought out essays proving shit to you. If you are intellectually curious enough to ask then you’d have done some of your own research then ask intelligent questions. You kinda did that after your little google quip.</p>

<p>It’s not that he went around with his foster father collecting the possessions of Jews, it was that he later on in life described it as one of the “happiest times of my life.”</p>

<p>Tbh, that’s pretty mild compared to the other skullduggery he has his fingerprints on</p>

<p>Tbh, I was just trying to point out how we&#39;ve been told both of these things are the devil, but now one is against the other. Are we supposed to take that as SM = good because Soros is against it? Or is Soros good because he&#39;s against SM?</p>

<p>I&#39;m being told to think too many contradictory things!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do sometimes wonder if guys like Soros are actually sincere.  Not that he isn&#39;t greedy and corrupt, not that he doesn&#39;t hold wacky beliefs, but that he sincerely beliefs stupid progressive ideas and likes promoting them for that reason.</p>

<p>I mean, why do we assume he&#39;s even aware of certain social and economic fallacies?  He&#39;s just good at manipulating financial markets.  That doesn&#39;t mean he knows at all what the effects of social policies are.  Maybe he believes his ideas are good.</p>
