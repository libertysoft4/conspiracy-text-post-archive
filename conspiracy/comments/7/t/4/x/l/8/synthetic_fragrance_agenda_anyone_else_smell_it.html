        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ever since I&#39;ve begun to learn of the atrocities of western society, I&#39;ve been slowly weeding out toxic chemicals from my life. Even so, one major one that I don&#39;t have much control over is artificial fragrance, not because I use them but because everyone else around me has been duped (neighbors, friends and some family members). I step outside for a breath of fresh air and lo and behold the air stinks of detergent, dryer sheets and whatever else.</p>

<p>The idea of spraying or releasing extremely harmful chemicals into the air ties into the whole web of conspiracy we&#39;ve come to know and I believe it is becoming a major part of it. The fragrances continue to get stronger and seem to be causing people to have a near hatred for the natural scent of the human body. This is likely having a hugely detrimental impact on our hormone interaction, pheromones, psychological response to smell, and our sense of smell in general. Not only that, but there are likely chemicals hidden in the &quot;fragrance&quot; that disrupt normal bodily functioning and also accumulate over time, causing disease after years of poisoning.</p>

<p>Please do yourself and your families a favor and stop it with the artificial scents. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people who are sensitive to it as I am, and it can be extremely frustrating. It does not smell good whatsoever, it smells like cheap industrial waste which is probably what it&#39;s made from.</p>

<p>There is an alternative as always, which is to use scents that come from natural sources with no synthetic chemicals included or at the very least are &quot;fragrance free&quot;. They&#39;re likely a little more expensive but at least you won&#39;t be paying to poison yourself. The easiest way would just be to give it up altogether and go back to being a natural smelling human being.</p>

<p>Just for clarity; artificial fragrance is in things like: perfume/cologne, laundry detergents, dryer sheets, dish/hand soap, candles, air fresheners, shampoo etc.</p>

<p>Inform your friends and family if you&#39;re being affected by this because they won&#39;t know until something is said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow I&#39;m glad someone finally said this. In an average household you find deterrgent, fabric softner, dishwashing liquid, shower gel to name a few. And every single one has a different, overpowering chemical smell. On top of that, there will be candles made of paraffin which is a carcinogen when burned. </p>

<p>On the other hand, you really have to dig around for natural scented stuff in supermarkets, and it wont come cheap. I&#39;m a student and now have to hand wash my clothes in the bath with organic soap because my housemates use the cheapest laundry detergent and nobody really cares to spend more on a less toxic one. It literally makes me sneeze uncontrollably so now I spend every Sunday washing my bed sheets in the fucking bath  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow really? Glad I told ya something new! Yeah, they do it to keep you awake, focused and alert. Combine that with a winning high and you have dangerous cocktail. Have you ever been to a casino? In not go once, but go for like an over nighter. You will not get tired. I forget which one I was at in Jersey but I was got there about 8pm and was there until 7am wide awake drinking the whole time. I&#39;m not really a gambler but went with friends and wanted to at least experience it. Drinks are free also, and this is the crazy part. They always seem to find you almost as soon as your drink is empty with a full drink ready for you.</p>
