        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t really know where else to put this but this seems like a good place to post it for now at least. Excuse me if my writing is a mess i&#39;m pretty sick and am having some trouble in the brain fog department.</p>

<p>Fox news makes me actually scared, i&#39;m physically stunned when i watch it. It&#39;s so strange the way they speak. Everything they say carefully worded as if to say look at what liberals are doing to YOU or look at what our corrupt government officials are doing to YOU while they undermine trump who is our democratically elected amazing leader who cannot fail. Everything out of the show hosts mouth to make you seem powerful and intelligent for having these beliefs, conservative values and support for trump is the only correct way of thinking. I flip on fox and all i see every single time is someone extremely angry talking about the danger the liberals and those who undermine trump are putting this nation in, they label republicans who oppose trump as literally treasonous. </p>

<p>Now before i moved out of the house, my parents watched fox, this was many years ago,they were and remain mainly conservative. However back then it wasn&#39;t all they talked about. Today the stuff said by the talking heads on the channel is all they can repeat. Destroy Hillary and the democrats and let trump rain supreme. My parents are both very intelligent, the kind of people who could have afforded to retire a long time ago but didn&#39;t because they are hard workers who love it, they are the type of people who design new products and change how things are done. Which is why it is so shocking to hear them mindlessly spew all of the rhetoric on this channel, they are increasingly angry and every time i go to see them they are glued to fox news every single night. I&#39;ve noticed how mad they become about politics, its all they talk about, convinced all the time that Hillary Clinton and the democrats will be &quot;destroyed&quot; or some shit like that. It&#39;s horrifying to see how they&#39;ve changed, it is actually changing them as people and it chills me to the bone. I&#39;ve sat down with them while they watch it and i think I&#39;ve figured that their favorite show is Tucker Carlson, who by the way looks like he has 2 separate pairs of boat shoes, 1 for his dock and 1 for when he actually steps on the yacht and he hasn&#39;t changed his haircut since he left &quot;the best party hes ever been to&quot; at Yale. Anyways he puts on this face, this condescending &quot;i know i&#39;m right but why are you wrong&quot; face. He makes his guest look as idiotic as possible if they are liberal or as smart as possible if they agree with him. This is why i believe he&#39;s my parents favorite, and many peoples favorite as he is number two most viewed on fox i believe. He makes people feel so powerful with the way he delivers &quot;the facts&quot;, its a unique way meant to create a sense of dominance over your political opposite. </p>

<p>Now i know CNN, MSNBC, as well as others do the same but the way fox conducts itself just makes me sick in a way, they way it seeps in to peoples minds.</p>

<p>Id love to hear commentary on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mischaracterization is opinion, whereas CNN telling outright lies is perjury against the public. If Assange makes a questionable claim, you might be better suited asking why you would question it. What did Assange even say that&#39;s supposed to be misconstrued? You realize dozens of Wikileaks employees have been murdered by CIA and other rogue Globalist rats? Why would Assange be practicing restraint, that is not what real media does when it comes to exposing reality to the 99% slaves of the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea but cnn doesn’t have a fan base.   Before the election no one cared about cnn.   Also, while they may promote some obscure “liberal”-esque agenda,  Fox promotes total utter ideological divide, plainly and clearly,  race hatred, idiocy, war, wealth, and the total destruction of human rights all in the name of the “people”.   Hey if some freak wants a black dude to fuck his wife.  Be my guest, weirdo.    If some guy hates “niggers” and welfare recipients, loves Israel, wants to bomb Iran and All Arabs .. etc..

    <div class="md"><p>True, but Fox makes no pretence of subtlety. At least Maddow will deliver a decent investigative piece involving lots of moving parts every once in awhile before launching into some seriously unhinged red baiting nonsense. And yeah, I don’t think she´d mind a war. But Fox is painful to watch. I called shenanigans when I was eight and I watched a whole theatre full of supposedly intelligent people break out sobbing when ET died and I have detested emotional manipulation ever since. Not to say that I am immune, but for Christs sake, a little subtlety goes a long way. And if Fox has decided to crank it up its own particular brand of agitation up a notch, I could see it creating some disturbed people.  </p>

<p>This is a pretty normal statement when someone pesters you constantly about your politics and doesn&#39;t even acknowledge your own agency in the matter and blames it on brainwashing.  Eventually you just give up and say, &quot;you&#39;re right, I just like being told what to think&quot; because it&#39;s easier than having to ruin a friendship over it or continue arguing about it for eternity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>fox isn&#39;t the news, it&#39;s an opinion show about the news lol. My mom only started watching fox because she was alienated from the Democratic Party after bernie got screwed. they were the only tv &quot;news&quot; show that really talked about how corrupt the democrats were. I then introduced her to people like George Webb and crowdsource the truth that report on facts without shitty opinions and she kind cut down watching fox. She only still watches because they still trash the democrats. To be honest it&#39;s pretty worrying how she&#39;ll watch a nights worth of shit for 20 minutes of tucker Carlson and hannity talking about stuff she&#39;s known for months because my mom is a smart woman but I&#39;m noticing little talking points here and there rubbing off into casual conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhh if you don&#39;t realize by now that ALL news is like that then idk what to say. You could&#39;ve literally replaced fox with ANY news channel(even some &quot;independent&quot; sources) and it would be the same thing. It&#39;s not left vs right. That&#39;s the game they want you to play. </p>

<p>You should just get an overall view by doing your own research and come to your own conclusions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub has been overrun with Trump shills. You won&#39;t get much in the way of constructive conversation here. Just a bunch of BSABSVR. Fox is state-run propaganda that straight-up lies 24/7 &quot;the evil MSM&quot; cannot even begin to compare. MSM makes errors and corrects them. Fox lies, and lies, and lies right to the faces of the rubes and they lap it up like the boot-lickers they are. Good luck.</p>
