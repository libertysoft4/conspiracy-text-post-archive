I swear to god people are being blindly manipulated by the media. All of her emails &amp; shady shit is basically swept completely under the rug for most people. Try and mention any of it &amp; you&#39;ll instantly be hit with &quot;Muh Fake News&quot;, &quot;Not Credible&quot;, like why the fuck is it okay to call out Trump for being a bastard but seeming considered &quot;Taboo&quot; to say shit against Hillary. Just look at any popular subreddit, like r/askreddit for example. Any posts about hillary will instantly downvote bombed in a heartbeat, its like some sort of mass censorship. This is legitimately the only subreddit i&#39;ve seen that&#39;s somewhat safe from this. When did this ever start, i thought people where pro-bernie &amp; anti-Hillary. What caused this phenomenon </p>

<p>Edit: See, the downvote bomb proves my point. I went from 98 % upvoted to nearly 50% in a short span</p>

<p>Edit 2: Apparently my Account is banned now, for like no reason at all. I recieved no message warning me about this ban. This is completely unfair, freedom of speech is gone</p>

<p>Edit: Was just flat out told by the mods that i have no freedom of speech &amp; was banned apparently expressing it. This is injustice</p>

<p>If one is taking what was <em>stolen</em>, as these Rights were, then they are justified. And I am not talking about violence per se- nonviolence often works better. But my main point was that these Rights were already there, they were merely obstructed. To fight to take them back is a necessity.</p>

<p>Our discussion wasn&#39;t about violence, tho, it was about Natural Rights and whether they are granted or already exist. I argue that they already exist and were obstructed, therefore necessitating a fight in order to ensure they are no longer obstructed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Violence is always the ultimate resolution to all problems. If you kill your opponent, you no longer have an opponent and you get what you want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only on the surface level. In reality, violence is a cycle. Kill one person, and you have 2 more who want to see you dead, this increases at an exponential rate. The Greeks identified this in the Odyssey- Odysseus slays the suitors in righteous rage but begins anew the cycle of violence, and only the intervention of Athena can prevent it from spiraling out of control. Violence begets violence. Peace begets peace.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have been pacified and indoctrinated to believe in passive rights and the passive &quot;acquisition&quot; of what you want. That is false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that these Rights already exist. I believe that they need to be fought for against those who obstruct these Natural Rights. It is not pacification.</p>

<p>Nature created man. Nature created consciousness.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re romanticizing a much simpler concept. Yes, nature grants everyone the natural right to live their life free from the domination of others if they happen to be free from others who are able to dominate them. However, nature is a cold bitch and also grants everything and everyone around you the natural right to do try to do anything at all to dominate or even kill you. You also have the natural right to try to defend yourself, but at the end of the day natural rights end when somebody wins. That&#39;s what makes them natural. They exist because you have the free will to try. This whole social structure that we have built may grant us additional rights, but they are artificial in the sense that the moment the social structure is not able to protect you, natural rights once again rule the day. </p>

<p>The problem here, is that, you are coming at this from a perspective from 2018 (a civilization in decline). You have no idea what happened in the past, and why certain things were accepted by both male and females. </p>

<p>Like I said, it was a survival trade off. Men can survive without women, but, women cannot survive without men, especially in the olden days. Men built civilization for women and for their future prosperity.  As the saying goes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Behind every great man, is an even greater women</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You (and others), I feel, are undermining women of the past (and somewhat of the present) and acting like they were oppressed because you are so well un-oppressed, and have no idea what that actually means to be (ie. coddled). </p>

<p>My babcia came here to the US, alone, on a ship from Poland when she was 14 with little to no money, and married a ~25 year old. She lied about her age, and did this to escape Poland (ie. survival for her and her posterity - ultimately leading to me).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were taken as a manner of control, one way or the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is completely untrue. You have been propagandized in thinking this way. It&#39;s always been a trade off, and quite frankly, the women always has the most control in a relationship at the end of the day. Men fought died in wars for women, and their children&#39;s future. Women gave up certain duties, in order to &quot;fight&quot; for their husband&#39;s and children&#39;s future. A trade off. </p>

<p>Stop buying into the propaganda, yo&#39;. I know you are smarter than that (or at least, I think you are)... </p>

<p>The problem here, is that, you are coming at this from a perspective from 2018 (a civilization in decline). You have no idea what happened in the past, and why certain things were accepted by both male and females (ie. a trade off).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see where you are coming from, but I do accept this trade off. I&#39;m not arguing with you here. I understand the necessities and why human civilization and the nuclear family developed as it did, not arguing that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You (and others), I feel, are undermining women of the past (and somewhat of the present) and acting like they were oppressed because you are so well un-oppressed, and have no idea what that actually means to be (ie. coddled).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about the ancient era or even the early modern era. In fact, I believe that women were likely the creators of human society and consciousness as we know it. It&#39;s even attested that in most societies, the Great Mother was originally the supreme deity of the pantheon, it is only with the development of warfare, as you suggest, that the Masculine subsumed the feminine, and this was a natural development. I&#39;m not arguing with you about that, I think we agree on a lot here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is completely untrue. You have been propagandized in thinking this way. It&#39;s always been a trade off, and quite frankly, the women always has the most control in a relationship at the end of the day. Men fought died in wars for women, and their children&#39;s future. Women gave up certain duties, in order to &quot;fight&quot; for their husband&#39;s and children&#39;s future. A trade off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not really disagreeing here. I think it might be helpful to highlight where exactly I think I&#39;m arguing from- a 20th/21st century historical perspective. I&#39;m not extrapolating back to ancient times, or even to the 19th century, I&#39;m talking about the treatment of women concerning the Vote and concerning their control over themselves and their bodies that the 21st century granted, and required them to fight in order to obtain. Perhaps my definition of Rights in this argument was a bit too large.</p>

<p>this conflicts with your statement that rights are given by stronger figures. No, this sentence is correct, women there do not have a voice and enough rights because men took those from them. I&#39;m also confused with your stance on this, are you frustrated that women have their rights taken from them? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah see those are all instances of people taking away other people&#39;s freedoms. It&#39;s not giving anything. Sure you can say slave owners gave their slaves a room and three meals a day so they wouldn&#39;t retaliate and keep working, but they took their lives. And sure the banks lend that money to the debtors, but now it&#39;ll take that debtor time and more money and don&#39;t forget interest to pay that all back -- the bank is taking away the debtor&#39;s time, money, and possibly a secure life. And yeah governments give their soldiers pensions and financial support for college and whatnot, but they took the soldiers&#39; freedoms to live a normal life as well. The only reality is that powerful people take away what everyone already has, not that the &quot;weak&quot; are simply able to speak or vote because some stronger guy allows them to.

<p>Is this the thing where they are trying to take over every school board, HOA and municipal position and work their way up? If so, I agree, it&#39;s an interesting strategy, but I think once people figure out it&#39;s socialism it won&#39;t go much further. </p>

<p>This is a good perspective data point. I see the same disdain, but from my perspective it looks more like he tried to take on the cartel and then got smacked back into place. He might be a rebel at heart, but this is a game of results, not feels. It looks like they have him on a leash. Honestly, given the way that leverage is used in this town it would be surprising if he didn&#39;t work some sort of deal in exchange for not having his wife maliciously prosecuted. She may very well be guilty of her crimes, but there&#39;s a finite amount of resources to devote to crime investigation and there&#39;s likely been some unnatural forces involved in focusing them his direction. </p>

<p>This is not to say it can&#39;t be another company. A super-PAC like CTR actually did not have to disclose publically that it was using social media and coordinating with the Clinton campaign. This theoretically means any number of PACs that didn&#39;t volunteer to disclose this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I remember looking through snopes articles back around 98 or 99 because that was around the time that urban legends became interesting to me.  I remember snopes links being posted to slashdot and kuro5hin.  Sorry, but you&#39;re talking bullshit.  Feel free to argue about it&#39;s current bias or lack of it or whatever, but it&#39;s ridiculous to tell people who actually went to snopes back then that it simply wasn&#39;t around.</p>

<p>Probably an OutoftheLoop question, but are Google searches still reliant on the actual content of the site? For example, a friend in highschool (2001-2002) was the top google result for &quot;bitch drinks.&quot; He had a blog he would write rants on when he was drunk and his angst at the time was against people who drank smirnoffs and the like. Seems that search result would be unlikely to happen in the same situation today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup content plays a major role, now maybe more than ever. Google has shifted their algorithm favoring quality content over the last few years. In the old days you could spam the shit out of a site with crappy links and over-optimizing for keywords, but Google has became significantly smarter in how they rank things. </p>

<p>There are a lot of keywords (like &quot;bitch drinks&quot;) that may get a few searches a month that you can rank for just by writing an article about it. Simply because no one else is writing and optimizing for that specific keyword/subject.</p>

<p>Sure, she claimed repeatedly from day one that the Uranium One deal, which she personally authorized/brokered after receiving millions of dollars from the man it was granted to (he since pledged 100 million more to her foundation look it up) was totally legal. Now, her close ally on the project, a fellow Democrat, has been charged with 13 felonies because the deal was NOT proper, nor was it legal.</p>

<p>Rod wheeler was indeed offered to family on a pro-bono basis, they graciously accepted his offer. After the family began being shadowed by an infamous DNC spokesperson, they said they had not authorized any of his statements (the ones you hear MSM parrot about how family wants to forget about Seth Rich, they never said that) and Rod Wheeler, their representative, on undercover video, says that D.C. Forensics found evidence that Seth had contacted Wikileaks on his laptop. Obviously you will not see the DNC publicly investigated pver Seth Rich, but the case is very real and ongoing. It&#39;s not a &quot;conspiracy&quot; when Podesta said in an email he wanted to make an example of any leakers whether there was even actual basis or not. These are sick devils and they will be purged by the law.</p>

<p>Mark Lambert, a Maryland transportation firm executive, faces 11 counts of money laundering and wire fraud for allegedly bribing Russian officials to win contracts to transport uranium. </p>

<p>The indictment comes after reports in late December that the Justice Department was taking a new look into the Obama-era deal that gave Russia partial control of the U.S. uranium supply.</p>

<p>This one is pretty obvious. Different front company =/= different actors. Same Russian State authorities, same time frame, and is literally part of the Uranium One investigation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nor did they hire DNC representative that they openly stated in several interviews was NOT their spokesperson. This is the same crisis-pointman DNC had used for previous cases, and he has since disappeared.</p>

<p>I never said they hired the PI, I said that the only PI they authorized to investigate has said that Seth Rich is the leaker according to Federal investigation.</p>

<p>Hillary openly discussed in a high level government meeting, the possibility of &quot;cant we just drone strike the embassy in London where Assange is?&quot; You think that was a joke?

    <div class="md"><p>To preface this, I would consider myself a liberal, but I do not support Hillary in any way.</p>

<p>I think the most obvious reason is just that the majority of Reddit is left-leaning, and in American politics, members of a certain party are always very pressured (often successfully) into supporting the party&#39;s candidate. I think the most probable reason that Reddit is so left-leaning is just the age demographic, most active online people are young, and most young people are liberal. In general, people get defensive about their political views, and when you &quot;attack&quot; a person they endorse, they view that as an attack upon them.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the things that I think are unacceptable about Trump do not outweigh the things that Hillary has done. Rather, I saw them both as unfit to be president, a view which has been confirmed time and time again (In my opinion). I certainly don&#39;t wish to start any arguments about this, just presenting my point of view.</p>

<p>Of course there were always the people here who would believe anything too.  And those same people fall down rabbit holes that make us fight amongst ourselves.  </p>

<p>I think a there are definitely a few conspiracies that are entirely fabricated so that the believers make us all more alienated overall. (I&#39;m looking at you flat earth and reptilians)  </p>

<p>I&#39;d go as far to say that these disinfo campaigns are probably state funded initially until the believers can carry the gospel of lies themselves. </p>

<p>Anytime an anonymous source drops inside knowledge there&#39;s a chance it&#39;s horse shit</p>

<p>Their web of lies is most likely to cover their own asses,  which would mean they&#39;re at least worried that the info is out there.   What that info is is the real question.  I think the idea that our history is wrong is what they are trying to hide.  They know something more about our origins as a species.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to be a dick, but you&#39;re kind of asking for it. Seriously, use some common sense. You really can&#39;t figure this out on your own? Seriously?</p>

<p>High rent prices - supply and demand. Supply is limited, demand is high as hell and LA for example has a very low vacancy rate and extreme competition. By the time you see something online and its been there for a day, there are already applications in. New supply is VERY VERY expensive and ONLY high end. </p>

<p>Then you have investors jumping in and buying houses and turning them into apartments which reduce the supply of houses and make the price of houses go up as well.</p>

<p>High taxes - are you really going to tell me that a single dollar of taxes doesn&#39;t go to illegals? All of welfare money for their 4 kids each that were born here. We just had a big gas tax increase. They aren&#39;t even telling us all the things it goes to. You think they are really going to tell us &quot;Hey, part of the gas tax goes to illegals!&quot; when they&#39;ve been lying and saying illegals don&#39;t cost us a penny?</p>

<p>They have tons of kids and they all go thru the school system. It cost about 15k-20k PER CHILD PER YEAR. You do realize that right? And its for 13 years and trust me they sign up for the free breakfast, lunch, after school programs, and everything else. Also lets not forget the school bus rides everyday.</p>

<p>Also most aren&#39;t paying taxes. So they aren&#39;t paying their fare share of money that go to schools, police stations, fire departments, etc...  They also commit tons of crimes, many unpunished, but still tons of crimes. A bunch of them are in jail too. So next time you wonder why the taxes keep going up, they also have to do with it.</p>

<p>Pollution &amp; Traffic - Really. Do I have to explain all the traffic we have here and how millions of them contribute to traffic in Los Angeles? More traffic, much more pollution. Much more gas being used, something liberals hate. They also almost always have huge cars and their cars smoke and cause all kinds of pollution. I see it all the time.</p>

<p>Freeloaders - Yes, they sign up for all the free shit. Especially for their &quot;legal&quot; kids that shouldn&#39;t be in this country and would have never been born here if it wasn&#39;t for corrupt liberals.</p>

<p>Crime - Are you serious dude? MS13 is a gang made up of many illegals. Most of them probably are. All commit identity theft or tax evasion. All of them that work, every single one of them. They also are huge in stealing shit and petty crimes. They steal from work often, they steal bikes often, and all kinds of other shit.</p>

<p>Many people from below the border (legal or not) have serious drinking problems and get DUIs. I see workers drink during the day all the time. I was near Downtown LA and went into a liquor store and the guy was buying beer. I asked the lady if this is common because who the fuck drinks at 10AM. She was mexican and she told me &quot;if these guys don&#39;t drink, they can&#39;t work.&quot; I&#39;ve seen this many times and I&#39;ve talked to other people and they have confirmed it. They also often drink after work.</p>

<p>Dude, you have no experience with these people. So don&#39;t make the assumption that I&#39;m wrong because  you lack the experiences that everyone around them has. Everyone knows this shit about them.</p>

<p>They also suck up our limited resources. California had a serious water shortage, it has an electricity shortage also because of the natural gas leak. Its not too serious but the  prices are fucking out of control. If they weren&#39;t here, they wouldn&#39;t be drinking our limited amounts of water and creating a bigger shortage.</p>

<p>These people just use and abuse the country. They don&#39;t contribute for shit. We have our own people that are losing jobs due to this shit. If you see any illegals working at any business, its clear they took someone else&#39;s job.</p>

<ol>
<li>High rent prices was backed up by evidence. Its called supply and demand. I went further to explain investors buy homes and make apartment buildings out of it reducing the supply of homes for home buyers. Then I explained all new developments are high end.</li>

<p>Here you go kid: &quot;Kudler said that buying a house has become “basically unattainable” except for people in the upper-middle class or above. The median cost of a house in L.A. is now nearly half a million dollars. At the same time, the housing crisis pushed a lot of people back into the rental market. Today, more than half of all Angelenos are renters. All that, combined with limited housing stock and the difficulty of building anything but the fanciest apartments, has driven rents way up.&quot;</p>

<p>I know plenty of people that are treated like shit by others that go around blaming everyone else but themselves. You are one of these people and don&#39;t think you&#39;re ever responsible. Taking some responsibility in your life. Something that is lacking in people these days. If you were respectful, I would have definitely treated you differently. </p>

<p>You earned what you got and you did a good job being a dick yourself, thats why I treated you like trash. </p>

<p>Lets just look at an example of how you talked to me:</p>

<p>&quot;What is wrong is you throwing out a ton of &quot;stupid shit&quot; without a shred of evidence or references&quot; - First of all, it was the truth, not stupid shit. You just didn&#39;t like it. Second, its common knowledge, anyone with common sense knows most of this stuff and doesn&#39;t ask for evidence. But if someone wants to ask, that&#39;s fine. But don&#39;t try to act like a smartass and act like you&#39;re right and I&#39;m wrong because we both know that&#39;s not the case.</p>

<p>To me, I think it&#39;s a disparity between what people view as acceptable behavior, and wether that can out weight policy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true; it certainly doesn&#39;t explain why 22% of Republicans supported Obama bombing Syria if Assad used chemical weapons but 86% of Republicans supported Trump bombing Syria when Assad used chemical weapons.  If they were judging the behavior then it would look more like the Democratic Party demographic where the difference of opinion is lower than the polls&#39; margin of error (38% supported Obama doing it and 37% supported Trump doing the same thing).</p>

<p>Nor is this an isolated data point.  Consider how Evangelicals now feel about immorality and its relationship to ethics in a public role.  Before Trump came along as the Republican candidate, just 30% of Evangelicals thought someone who indulged in an immoral act in their private life could be ethical in public office.  That number has since leaped up to more than double at 72%</p>

<p>It&#39;s clearly not about the behavior for a sizeable chunk of the country.  It&#39;s about the the partisan affiliation of the person doing carrying out the behavior.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is astounding projection.</p>

<p>For decades we have had a right wing propaganda industry demonizing liberals and the real news media while blathering out cult-like talk to the effect of &quot;they&#39;re all lying to you; only we tell the truth and that&#39;s why they&#39;re all out to get us (and you)!&quot;</p>

<p>A significant chunk of the country has seen an entire industry grow out of demonizing them and has had to put up with it for decades.  Imagine knowing there is that kind of audience for content that is dominated by hate mongering focused on you.  That&#39;s what much of the country have been putting up with since the 1990s, so long in fact that it&#39;s normalized to the point of being invisible to you all.  That&#39;s why Ted Nugent&#39;s career was revitalized and now he gets White House invites and that&#39;s normal to a significant chunk of the country who were genuinely horrified over that red haired comedian who was promptly fired and had her career destroyed for what amounts to the same kind of conduct.  That&#39;s why a writer for SNL was fired for tweeting about Barron, but Rush Limbaugh&#39;s profile soared while he routinely called Chelsea Clinton &quot;the White House dog&quot;.</p>

<p>Imagine if one of Obama&#39;s kids went on tv and said they don&#39;t see Republicans as people?  No Democratic Party&#39;s offspring has ever literally dehumanized Republicans publicly like that in all my lifetime.  Yet it&#39;s treated as completely normal when Trump&#39;s son goes on Fox News does that to Democrats.  </p>

<p>Why is it such a shock that after decades of being the punching bags for the right wing propaganda industry, an industry that there is clearly a huge audience of people who thirst for content focused on demonizing much of the country, that some of the punching bags are hitting back a little?  Much of the country have been on the receiving end of much worse coming from a dedicated propaganda industry for decades now.  Imagine how they feel.</p>

And those head-lopping, girl-raping, culture-destroying heathen barbarians are as <del>brown</del>terroristy as they come. After all, the fiery thetoric from 9/11 has long since failed to stoke the needed patriotic fury and paranoia, and focusing on Afganistan and Iraq are good ways to get people to question the party line. But if they keep inventing boogymen for you to get your collective pants over and beg the government to protect you from them, they can keep taking your money, freedom and whatever else they want. All the while saying you need to give it up because you demand protection from the boogymen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they could only keep their caucus together by keeping the cost to $1.5 trillion over 10 years with no cost past that. The way they did this is by changing the inflation formulas to constantly raise taxes on everyone while doing a very large cut to the corporate taxes. After 5 years (would have to look that up) the tax cuts across the lower income groups expire to keep the cost at $1.5 trillion. The inflation changes and some other games allowed them to keep the high income tax cuts (pass through businesses were a big part of this) and corporate tax cuts past the 10 year time frame.</p>

So, a) that assumes that they could get enough Republicans to change it and b) that would mean they would have to accept and vote for the huge tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. They weren&#39;t going to be allowed to offer amendments. Would this change mean that they would have to allow for a full repeal of the estate tax? Would the new corporate tax rate be even lower?

    <div class="md"><p>We see things differently. That&#39;s the beauty of this country. I&#39;m still on the fence about net neutrality. I get that it gives the power back to the service providers. But I&#39;m suspicious of the push that I witnessed a few months ago that was prompted by companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Google. Net neutrality was only a thing for a couple of years. The internet existed and thrived long before the government stepped in to regulate it. And since the repeal I&#39;ve yet to be personally affected by it. That being said, I haven&#39;t really looked to far into it so I&#39;m still undecided. </p>

<p>The regulations he has already saved hundreds of millions of dollars. Makes it easier for businesses to start up. Which in turn employs more Americans. We&#39;ve already seen several companies reinvesting in the US again. </p>

<p>If by the EPA stuff your referring to The Paris Accords, I&#39;m glad we pulled out of that. Fishy, fishy shit right there. Doesn&#39;t make any sense whatsoever why our country would pay poorer countries to go green. It&#39;s also slightly suspect that Obama pushed through $500 million days before Trump was inaugurated. Who&#39;s responsible for overseeing where that money goes? </p>

<p>Those tax cuts, while temporary for common folks like us, are good for business. Apple recently announced that their coming back to the states and with it 20,000 jobs will be created and $38 billion in taxes paid here, rather than Ireland. It is good for business. Although I do get were your coming from on the permanence of corporate tax cuts vs ours.</p>

<p>And Democrats are just as in bed with corporate sponsors and lobbyist as the Republicans are. You can look at the amount of money raised by the Clinton campaign vs Trump campaign and Obama&#39;s campaign vs McCain&#39;s campaign if your doubtful. Their just better at selling their platforms is all. I respect your views, I just happen to disagree. Hope you enjoy your Tuesday!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Net neutrality is actually how the internet was run for many years. It is only recently that the ISPs have been changing that, which is why the rules were put in place to try to push it back towards how it used to be. Once Verizon won in court, throwing out those provisions, the FCC then declared them common carriers to put them back under them.  That is the way it is.</p>

<p>The environmental stuff is not the Paris Accords...which honestly, was weird to get upset over, since it was a voluntary agreement with no penalties, but regardless...It was stuff like these:
*Revoke rule that prohibited mining companies from dumping toxic waste in waterways near mines.
*Removed rules limiting mercury and air toxins from power plants</p>

<p>Money being brought back to the US is good, though they are paying a very small amount of taxes on it compared to what they would. It is taxed at what, 15%? Who is going to make up the money that used to be earned through the corporate taxes that are lowered? If we want to move away from corporate taxes, some other taxes are going to have to be increased or spending will need to be decreased. The Republicans have decided to reduce spending but removing safety net programs. I mean, there are really only two ways...military or safety net. The rest of the federal budget is a pittance besides them.</p>

<p>That&#39;s complete bullshit.  It was always a thing.  The only new thing is how it&#39;s achieved and only changed because one of the companies whose conduct is regulated by net neutrality went to court to have the old means declared illegal.  Now they like to pretend that net neutrality suddenly came into being with the new method, even though they must have known it existed before when they sued to try to get rid of it necessitating the new method using the FCC.</p>

<p>Is he really anymore &quot;racist&quot; or &quot;sexist&quot; than the typical American? </p>

<p>And do those terms mean anything anymore?  &quot;Racist!&quot; is the accusation made now for anyone who disagrees with the multiculturalism agenda or questions ethnic double standards.  It used to mean something more in line with active discrimination or hostility towards racial minorities.  &quot;Sexism&quot; is equally blurry, catch-all category which means anything from forcible rape to offending a woman&#39;s sensibilities.</p>

<p>Both terms are used like cudgels to silence someone questioning the agenda of many activist agendas.</p>

<p>As for Trump, he&#39;s definitely crude in a way that seems somewhat unbecoming for public office, whether he actually has it out for women or minorities I don&#39; t think can easily be objectively said as true.  It&#39;s hard to draw a line between his personal comments and the intense public assault on his character for political purposes.</p>

<p>Policy wise, I think he&#39;s a bit of a disappointment and I think he&#39;s been too soft on Republican policies he seemed to be against while campaigning.  More party loyal and less willing to challenge status quo ideas than he seemed to be as a candidate.  I&#39;m not sure if this is political reality in play or whether he&#39;s just an opportunist.</p>

<p>And all of this could just be wrong, and Trump is just a chaotic person with no specific agendas or goals.</p>

<p>Seriously if this is the type of behavior that Trump inspires..then why are you acting shocked when people treat Trump and his family with the same transgressiveness?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s just nonsense. If you want to see what actual authoritarianism looks like look no further than North Korea. Or better yet, how about the alt-left. They are constantly and consistently shutting down free speech on college campuses across the country. People really need to wake the fuck up to what&#39;s going on at universities these days. Anyone with a dissenting opinion is labeled and accused of hate speech. Effectively shutting down any conversation that might have contradicted their ideology. Anyone who believes that immigration should be reformed is labeled a racist/bigot, despite the fact that black Americans overwhelmingly support the issue. </p>

<p>What a load of bullshit.  How many college campuses are there across the country?  How many individual incidents of this speech shutting down?  How many individual colleges are actually even effected?  And how do you consider a bunch of over excited college kids to evidence of anything particularly meaningful?  They&#39;re college kids; their brains have not finished developing, many of them are being exposed suddenly to a whole new world, to new people and experiences and they&#39;re at an excitable age where balanced judgement tends to be lacking.  </p>

<p>And that&#39;s your great free speech risk?  While the current president has literally spoken about wanting to change the Constitution to limit free speech and routinely attacks the free press, even calling it the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; - that phrase being the kind of talk one expects to hear out of authoritarian regimes like North Korea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your either seriously uninformed or your one of those social justice warriors out there participating. I&#39;m very aware that their young, impressionable, passionate kids. You may grossly underestimate what young, impressionable, passionate kids are capable of, but I don&#39;t. It cost UC Berkley $600,000 for security for a Ben Shapiro speech. $600,000. That&#39;s crazy money. If those young, impressionable, passionate kids were nothing but what you seem to believe they are it would cost no where near that.</p>

<p>If they were only out there holding signs, peacefully practicing their free speech this wouldn&#39;t be an issue. But it is an issue. College should be a place to open your mind to different ideas and values. All sides of an issue. But today rather than listen to somebody with an opposing view the alt-left disrupts and actively tries to shut down the event. There is no open debate. If you don&#39;t have the same worldview then the alt-left will call you a racist/bigot completely shutting down any conversation that could have been had. That&#39;s not good for our future leaders. And maybe you should read up a little about Marxism. We know nazi&#39;s are bad. Commies were awful to you know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Add to this, there is an impression that no matter what Hillary Clinton does she will be hated because she is a woman, culturally liberal, or both and so many on the left rush to defend her because she has been attacked for so long and nothing has been proven. This creates the impression by the left that she is the victim of a never ending witch hunt and nothing she says or does will ever be good enough for the Right.</p>

<p>So anyone who has ever been a victim of the Rights attack or is culturally liberal will want to defend her, regardless of if they agree with her or not.</p>

All real discussion was buried. It happened overnight. There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that most of the pro-Hillary narratives are some sort of Soros psy op program. It&#39;s really easy to get Hillary bots on reddit. There&#39;s only 3 or 4 angles they take. &quot;But her emails!&quot; is a common sarcastic remark. There wasn&#39;t a single joke about Hillary passing out and thrown into a van. Has anyone ever been so immune to criticism? She was the deep state&#39;s only hope. </p>

<p>Because Hillary Clinton rigged the primaries and she&#39;s horrible. Most of the people who voted for Trump only did so to stop Clinton from winning.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an organized effort that has been ongoing heavily since the end of the DNC convention. Just some demographic information on Reddit for some context. Reddit is made up of about 75% Millenials. This demographic is largely left leaning (progressive left, not Centrist/Neoliberals.) They also happen to be the most anti-establishment demographic as well. According to this information when combined with current polling you will discover that something is very off. Sanders has super majority support from Millenials among a site that has a super majority representation of that demographic, so the real question is how is it possible to see positive news about Bernie Sanders get downvoted to zero in an environment where there should be a constant circle jerk. The numbers do not add up folks, most people are very aware of the shilling/astroturfing that goes on. For the folks who are denying this, look at this data and please explain how it&#39;s possible for Reddit to have a centrist/neoliberal pro-establishment leaning among a demographic that is the least pro-establishment/neoliberal leaning?</p>

<p>If you look at voters under 30 in the 2016 primaries, Bernie Sanders got more votes than Clinton and Trump COMBINED. That fact should tell you a lot about what millennials think of those politicians. Seriously, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/20/more-young-people-voted-for-bernie-sanders-than-trump-and-clinton-combined-by-a-lot/?utm_term=.a2b3b4259a7b">check it out</a>. Young people don&#39;t like Clinton. Trump actually got more votes than Clinton from people under 30, but Bernie blew them both away. According to the data in that chart there, Bernie got so many votes that would have gotten a 56% in a THREE WAY contest against Clinton AND Trump if only voters under 30 counted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is correct, but there&#39;s a nuance to it that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked. Paid advertisements are required by law to be identified as such. However, the PR firms that run this shit claim that they&#39;re not paying for the ad. They pay employees to post on Reddit, but they don&#39;t pay Reddit. So according to them, they&#39;re not &quot;paid ads&quot;. What a bunch of bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people don&#39;t like the Clintons. Even most Democrats understand that the Clintons are corrupt, horrible, nearly universally hated, and only about 25% of Americans even consider themselves a Democrat today. </p>

<p>The effect described in the op is due to astroturf. Paid public relations employees infiltrating social media to protect and defend their clients. Usually this means sockpuppet accounts trolling and vote manipulating, but at its worse, it can mean PR employees controlling mod teams of entire communities. This is why you can get banned from r/politics just for talking a lot about how the DNC rigged the 2016 primaries for Hillary Clinton. Hell, I got banned from r/sandersforpresident during the 2016 primaries for linking to news articles about the election fraud that was going on at the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spend most of my (reddit) time on this sub and have since coming here, when there were less than ~300k subscribers a couple years ago.  So, like others who&#39;ve been here for awhile, I&#39;ve watched this sub change considerably in that time and while I have been frustrated with the influx of nonsense at times, I never really checked out other subs, especially political ones. 
Well, the other day, I just so happened to peruse r/all and clicked on links here and there.  To be perfectly frank, I was appalled at the volume and severity of absolute horseshit, nonsense, and indoctrinated sheeple-minded thinking that exists on threads involving anything to do with partisan politics.  The Trump-haters/Hillary-lovers and vice-versa have turned this place into a bullshit soup where nourishment must be extracted.</p>

<p>After that experience, I feel better now saying that there seem to be more level-headed people keeping each other (and the stories/narrative) in check than in other subs where similar topics are discussed.</p>

<p>Keep it up, fellow inquirers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are living in a bizarro world where everything seems backwards.  The left loves the FBI and idolizes Comey as some sort of martyr.  Trump, the “law and order” candidate, and his supporters are claiming corruption.  The left suddenly is the one blaming everything on a foreign power and accusing people left and right of being Russian agents or bots.  The party supposedly in power is the one accused of “conspiracy theories” all the time.  People are very smug toward anyone that doesn’t follow the dem party line.  They won’t discuss.  Constant comparisons to Nazi Germany yet somehow “the resistance” mostly controls the narrative and hating the president is “cool” in pop culture.  I could go on and on but I won’t right now.  It’s like a switch went off and everything flipped.  Actual fake news is all over the internet, and mainstream sources are almost entirely partisan and biased.  We aren’t living in a world of different opinions but a world where people believe in altogether different realities.  Something toxic is going on and it can’t be good for the idea of a free and open democratic society.  </p>

I say this knowing my last five comments were an argument about how bad of a candidate Hillary was and as a larger point about Democrats having a piss poor 2016 message to voters causing them to lose. Beyond understanding that she was a terrible candidate she isn&#39;t that relevant anymore. She has no power and has been humiliated by losing to Trump. Continuing to bring her up when she isn&#39;t the topic is annoying.</p>

<p>What has she ever done to make you think that?  She&#39;s lost two presidential elections and only won her Senate seat because it was a democratic state and she had no opponent.  And the &quot;popular vote win&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anything at all, especially since most Americans didn&#39;t vote for her and she didn&#39;t even break 50%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what this sub used to be exclusively.  </p>

<p>Of course there were always the people here who would believe anything too.  And those same people fall down rabbit holes that make us fight amongst ourselves.  </p>

<p>I think a there are definitely a few conspiracies that are entirely fabricated so that the believers make us all more alienated overall. (I&#39;m looking at you flat earth and reptilians)  </p>

<p>I&#39;d go as far to say that these disinfo campaigns are probably state funded initially until the believers can carry the gospel of lies themselves. </p>

<p>Anytime an anonymous source drops inside knowledge there&#39;s a chance it&#39;s horse shit</p>

<p>Their web of lies is most likely to cover their own asses,  which would mean they&#39;re at least worried that the info is out there.   What that info is is the real question.  I think the idea that our history is wrong is what they are trying to hide.  They know something more about our origins as a species.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Add to this, there is an impression that no matter what Hillary Clinton does she will be hated because she is a woman, culturally liberal, or both and so many on the left rush to defend her because she has been attacked for so long and nothing has been proven. This creates the impression by the left that she is the victim of a never ending witch hunt and nothing she says or does will ever be good enough for the Right.</p>

<p>So anyone who has ever been a victim of the Rights attack or is culturally liberal will want to defend her, regardless of if they agree with her or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but yr wrong. It&#39;s not real. Reddit was never 100% 
real but got very very fake when Hillary claimed the nomination. I spent 10 years on reddit frequently in the politics sub and one day it became fake. Plain and simple. All real discussion was buried. It happened overnight. There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that most of the pro-Hillary narratives are some sort of Soros psy op program. It&#39;s really easy to get Hillary bots on reddit. There&#39;s only 3 or 4 angles they take. &quot;But her emails!&quot; is a common sarcastic remark. There wasn&#39;t a single joke about Hillary passing out and thrown into a van. Has anyone ever been so immune to criticism? She was the deep state&#39;s only hope. </p>

<p>To me, I think it&#39;s a disparity between what people view as acceptable behavior, and wether that can out weight policy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true; it certainly doesn&#39;t explain why 22% of Republicans supported Obama bombing Syria if Assad used chemical weapons but 86% of Republicans supported Trump bombing Syria when Assad used chemical weapons.  If they were judging the behavior then it would look more like the Democratic Party demographic where the difference of opinion is lower than the polls&#39; margin of error (38% supported Obama doing it and 37% supported Trump doing the same thing).</p>

<p>Nor is this an isolated data point.  Consider how Evangelicals now feel about immorality and its relationship to ethics in a public role.  Before Trump came along as the Republican candidate, just 30% of Evangelicals thought someone who indulged in an immoral act in their private life could be ethical in public office.  That number has since leaped up to more than double at 72%</p>

<p>It&#39;s clearly not about the behavior for a sizeable chunk of the country.  It&#39;s about the the partisan affiliation of the person doing carrying out the behavior.  </p>
