    <div class="md"><p>It is ... but feel it&#39;s standard practice for any business that has particular motives. They do it their way, don&#39;t have to make any sense to customers/users, and you sure as hell don&#39;t get a say. </p>

<p>I love the concept of reddit - it&#39;s too bad the MOD&#39;s are sometimes the biggest and most closed minded children on here. Some are great - and you&#39;ll find most of those in new subs where people have left others of their interest to start something a bit better. But in due time they tend to die, as they&#39;re over run with cunts and people who would just rather give shit than conversation - they get a kick out of that.. what a hobby haha. </p>

<p>Planet X has lots of proof for decades now - and they&#39;re saying people are wearing tinfoil hats. These are also the same people that when their kids fail a test, it&#39;s the teachers fault. </p>

<p>Some people could really use an extinction event ... like me, so I wouldn&#39;t have to come to a place I love to visit and see these comments from close minded red necks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you see a mod pop up unexpectedly on a sub you frequent; they are a shill.  Hands down, 100%, believe it.  There&#39;s no exceptions, and I&#39;m tired of this sub giving everyone &quot;the benefit of the doubt&quot; even when common sense doesn&#39;t warrant it.  You don&#39;t look fair, you look childish.  There was a mod flair up on this very sub.  It sucks that most mods are so lazy and narcissistic they need &quot;help.&quot;  No kid or lifestyle is that demanding, but here we are with 50 mods just of this sub alone.  </p>

<p>Reddit has opened the floodgates to people like David Brock that pay to control the narrative on the entire site.  And the mods are either shills paid by him directly or they&#39;re too lazy and dispassionate to do anything about it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it can be explained as cognitive dissonance. They intuitively feel there is some legitimacy to such speculation, but because it goes against their indoctrinated beliefs, they must <em>convince themselves</em> it is illegitimate. Hence their behavior.</p>

<p>If I say &quot;Julius Caesar occupied the moon while riding a unicorn&quot;, nobody would feel hostility. Indifference, or disdain at most.

    <div class="md"><p>Its possible. Something about the whole thing always seemed like a psyop to me. However, recently I&#39;ve done more investigation on the issue. The reason was because I found an interesting thread of information through the wingmakers time capsule website (wingmakers.us) which led to reading papers by the <a href="http://www.lpg-c.org/">Life Physics Group - California</a>. This is because the supposed leader of the &quot;Labyrinth group&quot; which is the supposed deepest black op level lab in the NSA (part of the NSA&#39;s ACIO) supposedly wrote some papers after he retired using the pen name &quot;A.R. Bordon&quot;. </p>

<p>I was entertaining that this might be legit because the information that was being revealed about human potential through our enteric mind and our genetic memory seemed to be spot on. </p>

<p>Bordon dedicates a good portion of his paper on extraterrestrial life talking about Planet X and the Annunaki which inhabit it, including their social and political structure. Their planet has an elongated 3600 year elliptical orbit in which it enters near the Earth&#39;s and Mar&#39;s orbit for a handful of years. This means that catastrophic natural disasters such as large hurricanes, floods, volcanic eruptions, an meteor strikes will have a natural 3600 year cycle. Planet X has 9 or 10 moons so depending on the positions of these bodies relative to the position of the Earth will determine the severity of the &quot;crossing&quot;. </p>

<p>Bordon points to the research of <a href="http://www.jmccanneyscience.com/">James Mccaney</a> as being one &quot;who has done the lion’s share of real scientific work in his exposition of the challenges, including what we need to do to survive&quot;.</p>

<p>In regards to evidence, Bordon references a couple points of data:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is growing evidence that we have gone through these kinds of events before. I invite you to read the books by Derek S Allan and J. Bernard Delair -- When the Earth nearly died: Compelling evidence of a world cataclysm 11,500 years ago (1994) and Cataclysm: Compelling evidence of a cosmic catastrophe in 9,500 BC (1997). There are now threads of reliably veridical information piercing the veil of secrecy about Planet X, and everything extraterrestrial. Two specific ones concern the observation of what in official circles is known as “the incoming,” that is, Planet X.  One such is the South Pole Telescope (SPT), located between the geographical and geomagnetic poles in Antartica. Operated by a consortium of astrophysical organizations, including several universities and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Society, its chief objective we know to be the tracking and development of an object-specific ephemeris for the main candidate. It has also been reported within official circles – the information emanating from the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) – that that the ephemeris was completed in the mid- to late-90s through astronomic efforts at Palomar, Cerro Chololo (Chile), and another facility in New Zealand. As of approximately 2004, the SPT (staffed by a rotating full time corps of senior astronomers, astrophysicists, and unconfirmed number of select graduate students) is said to have devised a “highly reliable ephemeris for the incoming,” and generated some visuals that have been followed up with the Spitzer.  Then there is a so-called Venetto project, originated and controlled by Italian intelligence led by the Servizio di Informazione dell Vaticano, in cooperation with NATO. This is said to operate a radio telescope reportedly located in the Alaska Range, in western Alaska, with additional facilities west of the range. The object of this project is also said to be Planet X and its accompanying group of comets and asteroidal objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, he claims that he examines this evidence in detail in chapters 33 and 34, but the pdf available on the life physics group website only has up through chapter 9. So is it part of an elaborate psyop?</p>

<p>Something else interesting about all this is that on the wingmakers.com website which is the &quot;tampered&quot; version of the original wingmakers site, the scientist there claims planet x is &quot;no longer an issue&quot;. To me that is suspicous, how could we have possibly dealt with such a massive threat if its existence is real? </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t, because it was (most likely) never real to begin with.</p>

<p>Just as the NASA Freemasons hoax the public on a regular basis with wild claims about meteors or other things that don&#39;t exist, &quot;potentially&quot; crashing into the Earth and <em>bang-boom everything explodes</em>.</p>

<p>To me it sounds all like distraction, since no person has actually ever seen the things these (conspiracy) speculations are about.</p>

<p>Just like UFOs: Wouln&#39;t, after a garillion years, a &quot;technologically superior&quot; alien race have made contact with the general population ??</p>

<p>Apparently they are scared by Hillary Clinton or something.</p>

<p>Close, but the names are much more ordinary.  Do billionaires control?  Sure, but it&#39;s more complicated than that.  You have to understand about Edward Bernays&#39; work and how it relates to the DNC, the MIC, and certain other big corporate groups with heavy public-sector control.</p>

<p>That&#39;s an interesting way of thinking the political parties as a sort of mega-corporation (conglomerate) with their underlying corporations (microsoft, ibm, apple, mcdonalds etc.) contributing to their corporate overlord (DNC, GOP) via &quot;&quot;&quot;donations&quot;&quot;&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is real hard scientific evidence for a Planet 9 that is more massive then Earth. There are various oddities in the solar system. Such as Trans-Kuiper Belt Objects such as Sedna that have a major-plane axis at 80AU(1AU = Sun to Earth distance). This means the scattering could not be caused by Neptune implying an alternate source needed for scattering at 80AU.</p>

<p>There is also a mild divergence from the solar plane in Kuiper Belt Objects(KBO) 8 degrees off. On average, all KBO should be on the solar plane and would smooth out over millions of years. This is not the case.</p>

<p>The main difference from Nibiru is this hypothesized planet has a much larger orbit and does not take it anymore close to Earth. Most hypothesis are hundreds of AU out, with only 1 theory taking it to 33AU at closest approach and 1 other 80AU at closest approach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In case it&#39;s not obvious I&#39;d like to say there isn&#39;t any real evidence for anything I&#39;m saying, but certain clues have led me to believe this. I for one believe that the NWO/TPTB tell us their plans through art, music and comics. One particular art piece that I&#39;m interested in is the <a href="https://i2.wp.com/vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/mural1.jpg">3rd panel</a> of the murals on display at the Bank of America (Charlotte, NC) headquarters building. These murals contain extensive occult symbolism and appear similar to those found in the Denver International Airport. Some have outlined the word &quot;William&quot; in the folds of the boy&#39;s right-arm sleeve but I&#39;m skeptical on that. Rihanna says <a href="http://yournewswire.com/rihanna-prince-william-is-the-antichrist/">Prince William is the anti-Christ</a>, FWIW. There are other clues that I&#39;m forgetting right now but I may add to this later when I&#39;m not working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except Nibiru/Planet X has never been a conspiracy theory. You were taught the 10th planet in school and its been mentioned in science publications as far back as the 80s. Even last year they were reporting on this &quot;planet larger than Neptune&quot; with a 45deg inclined orbit to the solar plane. The planet is real, that is not up for debate, its been proven observationally and mathematically to be orbiting our sun every 10-20k yrs. Because of its perpendicular orbital plane only South Pole telescopes can see it - it is approaching from below so to speak.</p>

<p>It may not be &quot;Nibiru&quot; like that schizo who translated the Sumer tablets claims, but there IS a planet orbiting our sun and it has already entered the inner parts of our solar system. Believe what you want, but there is an effort to keep this from being pieced together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This feels like some type of gaslighting psyop. Nibiru conspiracies are pretty silly stuff and I don&#39;t really pay much attention to it. Banning theories though usually has the opposite effect on the internet. Instead of squashing the theory bans just attract more attention to it. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Nibiru is being plugged by the mainstream media. ABC news of all people is talking about Nibiru today.
<a href="http://abc7ny.com/heres-why-some-claim-the-world-will-end-on-saturday/2428453/">http://abc7ny.com/heres-why-some-claim-the-world-will-end-on-saturday/2428453/</a></p>

<p>For some reason &quot;they&quot; want us to believe in this nonsense so they can turn the tables on us later and call us idiots. Much like the flat Earth psyop they want to be able to point and say conspiracy theorists are a bunch of morons who should never be listened to.</p>
