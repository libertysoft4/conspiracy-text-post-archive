        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Run down (pre-indictment) :</p>

<p>-Imran Awan is IT guy who worked for the DNC</p>

<p>-is arrested for bank fraud in an airport while trying to leave the US for Pakistan, where his wife is currently at</p>

<p>-Awan was making fraudulent loans for up to $300,000 </p>

<p>-as an IT guy, Awan was accessing the files of House’s Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees, was accessing their computers without their knowledge, transferring their files to remote servers, and stealing hard drives</p>

<p>-this wasnt just Imran, but the Awan family was all involved in this. 
okay, so this one guy was just running his own scam, right? It wasnt the DNC, right?</p>

<p>-while the Awan clan was fired, Imran kept employed by Debbie Wasserman Schultz up until he was arrested</p>

<p>-Awan began his career working for new york dem representative in 2004, and was hired on by Schutlz the next year</p>

<p>-from there, he secured jobs for his wife and other family members</p>

<p>-most people in this profession make around 40K, but Awans youngest brother Jamal had a starting salary of $160,000 for some reason</p>

<p>-the family made 4 million dollars from US tax payers as well as running various other scams from capital hill </p>

<p>-fast forward to after Imrans arrest, and Schultz is making cryptic threats to the police investigation on the case, why would she do this if she just got scammed? wouldnt she want to help the police in this case?
 
-The Awans had access to highly classified intel</p>

<p>-DNC is claiming this was unauthorized access they didnt condone, but in 2016, they wrote a letter to the house intel committee that their staffers should have &quot;unbounded access&quot; to &quot;Top Secret — Sensitive Compartmented Information&quot; the highest level of classified info</p>

<p>-ranking member of the subcommittee this letter was addressed to? Debbie wasserman schultz</p>

<p>-few desperate whimpers from democrats saying this is &quot;islamophobic&quot; targeting, but a distant family memeber of the Awans says that she was blackmailed by Imran who threatened to kidnap her because he was so &quot;powerful&quot; in a police report she reported to the Virginia state police</p>

<p>-And again, Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been butting heads with the police and FBI investigating this case as well</p>

<p>After Indictment:</p>

<p>FBI Suspects Members of Congress Leaked Grand Jury Indictment to the Awans; DOJ Officials Possibly Implicated Too</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Thomas1774Paine/status/900025298816823297">https://twitter.com/Thomas1774Paine/status/900025298816823297</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Federal agents said it appears more than likely a leak could have originated from any member of Congress linked to the Awan family. Federal law enforcement sources believe officials in Congress were tipped off by a subsequent leak in the Justice Department or the hierarchy of the FBI itself. The Grand Jury convened in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia on Nov. 13, 2016. Within weeks, Awan and his wife started moving money. Lots of it. To Pakistan and parts unknown, federal agents said. By the time Awan and Alvi were indicted on Aug. 17th, they had liquidated well over $2 million in U.S.-backed assets and property, sources and records show. That amount is likely to grow, as agents continue to work the cases.</p>

<p>And as much as $800,000 of that money was liquidated after Awan’s FBI arrest, exactly two weeks before his indictment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is no coincidence Awan began liquidating assets “like a mad man” in the days before his July 24th arrest, FBI sources and public records confirm. In fact, Awan closed deals on the sale of two houses for over $800,000. Both real estate assets were owned by he and his wife and he accepted buy offers on the properties the same day of his arrest. This was a small feat in itself because she was hiding 7,500 miles away in Pakistan. Awan was also lining up cash advances on credit line accounts and liquidating other financial instruments, federal sources said.</p>

<p>Federal agents said it is evident Awan was in a rush to liquidate assets prior to an arrest and indictment in a possible attempt to shield the real estate from</p>

<p>For Discussion:</p>

-Judge is corrupt and is suppressing all the major evidence, essentially. Same with the prosecution team; working together to quash as much dirt as they can so the measly bank fraud charge is all that he is tried for.</p>

<p>3)<a href="http://archive.is/ze33r">http://archive.is/ze33r</a>
-Hina Alvi, wife of Awan, has agreed to return to the USA &quot;some time near the end of September&quot; (23rd lol) For a plea deal/immunity to hopefully reveal a lot more.</p>

The blatant resistance against those who are truly investigating this should be the most eye opening aspect of the situation. I think it&#39;s going to pop, and expect to see and equal and opposite reaction from those who had everything, then little to nothing to lose. </p>
