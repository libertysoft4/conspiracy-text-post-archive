        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If we lead with the Zionism stuff, the uninformed masses will see two things--anti-semitism and wild crazy conspiracy theory, each empowering the other. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not the way to do it. </p>

<p>I recently posted a video here featuring a well-known television and radio personality, Lionel, giving an intelligent, articulate, 30-minute monologue about 9/11 aimed at the uninformed masses. Someone commented something to the effect of &quot;He didn&#39;t pin down the Zionist connection. Lionel is a Zionist tool. Downvoted.&quot;</p>

<p>Had he done that, he would have lost 90% of the people that video reached. Lionel is a very, <em>very</em> smart guy. He knows his history like the back of his hand. He also knows how glossed-over and fake most of our official history is. He commonly quotes Tolstoy: &quot;History would be a wonderful thing if only it were true.&quot; - there is truth in that sentiment. </p>

<p>I&#39;m positive Lionel is well aware of the issue of Zionism and its connection to 9/11 and many other bad things. This is a choice he&#39;s making. And it&#39;s the right choice.</p>

<p>We ought to be thankful that such a prominent and distinguished member of MSM is even willing to put his career on the line to question the official story. Many have lost careers over this. </p>

<p>Getting back to the title of this post--I think it would be wise to follow Lionel&#39;s lead here in terms of strategy. We all know about Zionism. We all know the problem. But the masses don&#39;t. And it will come as a shock to many of them.</p>

<p>The masses must be made to care. Too many don&#39;t. Find a way to make them want to research. There&#39;s nothing better than seeing someone write their <em>own</em> red pill prescription. And as for that last one in the bottle...they&#39;ll get there. </p>

<p>We all do. </p>

<p>Go around to people who are uninformed about 9/11 and ask them &quot;Did you know Zionists are behind 911?&quot; and see how many people stick around and listen to what you have to say. You&#39;re liable to be cursed, spat on, have coffee thrown on you, etc. but it certainly doesn&#39;t add to your credibility and make people <em>want</em> to listen. </p>

<p>Next, do the same thing, but instead of instantly blaming Zionists, ask them if they&#39;re aware that a third building fell that day at total and complete freefall for 8 stories. </p>

<p>No, none of us know who actually did it. Many have theories, as such, each are mere speculations from the outside looking in. If we actually knew who did it, things would be quite different, now wouldn&#39;t they?</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t just Zionists behind 9/11. Many groups were, imo. One group that is rarely mentioned, even though they have a documented of doing such things, are the Jesuits and SMOM.  Curious how not many people call that group out, even though assassination and political subversion is their bread and butter.  </p>
