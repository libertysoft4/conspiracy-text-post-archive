        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Im seeing alot of sentiment in this sub lately as how most of the world workforce is enslaved, enslaved by the necessity to work to afford existing. This condition of having to justify ones existence is unfair and slavery in disguise as some have described it here. And thus the system enslaves and leeches the vital force of its workers only to enrich and add to the leisure of the priviliged. This perspective is shortsighted and a trap. Its a trap because it furthers the mentality of us and them, the mentality of helplessness. If we are enslaved then there must be a slave driver whipping us all along, even if its the system that enslaves and not the elites.  And because of the proposed solutions which are like ubi universal basic income or welfare program are tragic patches that only end up fucking up the situation farther.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are you paying for that hospital visit, phone, cable, utilities?  Also, you&#39;ll need money for property taxes yearly.  Car registration, fertilizer for your farm, feed for any animals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, everything you need is on the farm.  You don&#39;t need to buy fertilizer, you can compost scrap food, leaves, grass, paper, wood to create a living soil.</p>

<p>Fruit and nut trees can be used to grow food long term with minimal care.</p>

<p>Cows can eat the grass and their poo can be used a fertilizer and put into the compost pile.  Chickens can roam range freely eating all the delicious bugs.</p>

<p>A person can sell crops, beef, and eggs for money, the money earned can pay for phone, cable, hospital visits/ buy insurance and you&#39;ll be able to pay for your property taxes and car registration with the money earned from selling food.  </p>

<p>Please believe that owning a farm can be very profitable, but you have to have the right mindset to do it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why people associate having a farm with living off the grid, you can own a farm and still live on the grid.  Plus you don&#39;t need millions of dollars to own a profitable farm, you just have to be a hardworker and love the outdoors and care for your animals.  Grow plenty of fruit and nut trees and you won&#39;t have to worry much about taking care of it, they water themselves, all you have to do is prune the trees and you can sell the nuts online if you like on ebay or have a website.</p>

<p>Basically running a farm depends on a person knowledge about nature, their work ethic, and whether they&#39;re business savvy.</p>

If your child and other half can&#39;t work the field with you anymore, then that means you have to work hard to get the work done, it&#39;s all about your personal work ethic, plus it wouldn&#39;t hurt to make a tree orchard that will provide bounties of food for plenty of years without having to replant seeds or water it.</p>

<p>When I said slave to the system, I was referring to the wage slave system, I never mentioned living off the grid, although people can if they choose to.  The OP was talking about work slavery, so I decided to provide an alternative to the mainstream 9-5 wage slave system.</p>

<p>Plus having a farm is a good way to have food just in case the market crash and the price of food sky rocket, look at what happened in Venezuela, plenty of fertile land, but very few farms, very few people who know anything about farming.  I bet Venezuelan farmers aren&#39;t going hungry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, we should not limit ourselves to thinking about slavery in material terms, but also we should think about slavery in spiritual terms. </p>

<p>If you meditate, you can perceive that you are an energetic body, independent of your physical chariot. You existed before &#39;birth&#39; and will continue to exist after &#39;death&#39;.</p>

<p>But while we are in this physical body, we forget about our spiritual nature, and becomes slaves to money, sex, alcohol, ego, romantic attachment, etc. </p>

<p>Our true nature is peace, love, and joy, and does not require any sensory stimulation for happiness.</p>

<p>Our material slavery can be looked upon as a metaphor for our spiritual slavery. Ultimately we will be free when we leave our body, but if we cannot act with love and forgiveness in this life we may have to keep coming back until we learn how. </p>

If your child and other half can&#39;t work the field with you anymore, then that means you have to work hard to get the work done, it&#39;s all about your personal work ethic, plus it wouldn&#39;t hurt to make a tree orchard that will provide bounties of food for plenty of years without having to replant seeds or water it.</p>

<p>When I said slave to the system, I was referring to the wage slave system, I never mentioned living off the grid, although people can if they choose to.  The OP was talking about work slavery, so I decided to provide an alternative to the mainstream 9-5 wage slave system.</p>

<p>Plus having a farm is a good way to have food just in case the market crash and the price of food sky rocket, look at what happened in Venezuela, plenty of fertile land, but very few farms, very few people who know anything about farming.  I bet Venezuelan farmers aren&#39;t going hungry.</p>
