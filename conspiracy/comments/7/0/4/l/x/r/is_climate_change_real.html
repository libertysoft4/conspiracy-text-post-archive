        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I&#39;ve been a firm believer that climate change is real and man made for as long as I&#39;ve known about the issue. It seems to make sense on the surface after all.</p>

<p>But as I have delved into conspiracy theories such as Haarp and TPTB I&#39;ve begun to question how much I really believe it. So I looked for an experiment that could prove it one way or another and there seems to be an abundance of simple experiments that prove the concept such as this:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Ge0jhYDcazY">https://youtu.be/Ge0jhYDcazY</a></p>

<p>But there&#39;s something that irks me with these experiments. None seem to pay much attention to how much CO2 they are pumping in and all use large levels of CO2 to cause an increase. </p>

<p>The atmospheric CO2 level has allegedly gone from around 280 ppm (0.03%) to approx. 400 ppm (0.04%). Could a change in composition of the atmosphere of 0.01% really cause several degrees of warming?</p>

<p><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/">https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/</a></p>

<p>Does anyone here have the resources and time to attempt this experiment but with better, more realistic control of how much change is made to the gas composition? I.e measure the level of CO2 and attempt the experiment at different levels. That way we could use the data to plot a graph and work out roughly what the effects of the addition of 0.01% CO2 would have to greenhouse effects. </p>

<p>Edit: maths</p>

The only reason the the world&#39;s leaders are pushing a global warming agenda is because they are going to charge the little guy a &quot;carbon tax&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>You are essentially claiming that small changes in atmospheric CO2 are more impactful than variation in the sun&#39;s activity, changes in earth&#39;s orbit and axial tilt, volcanism, reflectivity, the composition of other gasses in the atmosphere, etc.</p>

<p>So why are you so hung up on CO2? Especially considering that CO2 levels have been more than 5X higher in the past? Clearly, atmospheric CO2 levels also change naturally, but human&#39;s marginal contribution is going to destroy the earth?</p>

<p>From the 1940s to the 1970s, Earth experienced a global cooling period, even while carbon-dioxide levels continuously rose. In the early 21st century, global temperature “paused” for 18 years, again during a period in which carbon-dioxide levels increased. <a href="http://blog.heartland.org/2017/07/contra-noaa-warming-pause-real-say-climate-alarmists/">Source</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not that it creates a shield, it&#39;s that it mixes with the atmosphere as a whole, and the more CO2 is in there, the more heat it retains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government is using climate change to distract people from other serious issues like the 9/11 inside job, flat Earth and using Trump to gain global domination. They could easily use the dome that surrounds flat Earth to release the harmful gasses, but they would much rather it pollute our minds so that we are weaker and easier to deceive. They have an antidote for this effect of weakness by the way. When the time is right they will stage a terror attack just like they did during 9/11 to get the go ahead from congress and support from the populace to launch the first nuclear strike, sending US and the world into nuclear warfare. Their goal is to come out on top of this Third World War and have control over every nation on the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, I am sorry if I offended you in some way shape or form. I did not intend to. To answer your question, try putting a single light source in the center of a room at night. The angle of your shadow will change the farther away you get away from the light source. That experiment will demonstrate to you the effect of the sun over flat Earth and the different angles of shadows it makes, as your room is also flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you. I used to be a huge believer in anthropogenic climate change. It took me a while to finally think critically of it and really examine both sides of the debate. Now I think its incredibly naive to believe that CO2 is the primary driver in climate.</p>

<p>Like you said, atmospheric CO2 has gone from approximately 0.0003% to 0.0004%, and its been more than 5 times higher in the past. So clearly it naturally fluctuates with time, and that didn&#39;t cause the world to end.</p>

<p>That said, if we indiscriminately pumped greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere for a millennia or more, we could probably start affecting the climate in detrimental ways. I just don&#39;t think we have done so yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reality is far more complex, we are pumping aerosols of various types, methane, and other gases into the atmosphere in addition to CO2. How they all interact with the upper atmosphere to create and destroy ozone is a complex process. To me its unlikely that the changes we are experiencing is all from man made emissions. I think there are solar changes that are occuring that are also causing the changes. Evidence for this is the fact that the other planets are also experiencing warming. </p>

<p>There are a number of explanations I have come across for why the solar activity has been changing the past few decades. I will list 3 of the main ones that I find most likely:</p>

<p>1) Xavier Borg has done interesting theoretical work describing how Earth&#39;s velocity relative to the cosmic microwave background rest frame could be causing the fluctuations that we measure for the strength of gravity (G). <a href="http://blazelabs.com/f-u-massvariation.asp">See here for details</a>. This means that our velocity relative to the universal center reference frame is always changing since we are traveling in a helical pattern throughout the cosmos. We rotate around the sun at 1 year per revolution, but then we rotate around the galaxy at 1 revolution every ~230 million years. It seems likely this is related to our ice ages. It seems unlikely that the galactic revolution could be causing the changes we see now (they would be over a much longer time scale in the millions of years range), but it is possible that we are rotating around our local star cluster and that could cause a cycle that is in the tens of thousands of years time frame. Within our current ice age the interglacial period has been on 40,000 - 100,000 year cycles. I&#39;m not sure if this could be related, but it seems possible. </p>

<p>2) Along the lines of rotation around our local star cluster, there is the supposed &quot;Planet X&quot; or &quot;Nibiru&quot; that is talked about in Sumerian texts. This planet supposedly has a 3600 year orbit around the sun, and it is a very elongated elliptical orbit in which most of its orbital period it is far from the Earth. However, as it gets closer it will be interacting magnetically with the sun, creating changes in solar activity. Its possible that this body is moving closer to the solar system. However, famous writers such as Sitchin claim it will arrive around 2160, so if that is true it shouldn&#39;t be affecting things that much. </p>

<p>3) We are entering into a denser region of the interstellar region. In other words, our solar system is entering into some cloud, perhaps from supernova remnants. I&#39;m not sure about this theory, its being pushed by David Wilcock and Corey Goode so take of it what you will. Wilcock has done extensive research on these things and so his opinion is certainly interesting; im just not sure if these people are being fed disinfo. </p>

<p>My opinion is that there is something outside of the Earth&#39;s system causing much of the warming; although it is possible that some is coming from carbon emissions. There is no doubt that our pollution of the Earth&#39;s biosystems with hydrocarbons is extremely destructive to most lifeforms on the planet; however the extent to which it is causing the climate changes we have witnessed is far from clear as is touted in the mainstream media. I worked in a climate lab for a few years so I am familiar with the complications involved in predicting these things. We simply do not know the details on many of the minor chemical pathways and we tend to neglect feedback loops formed between biological life (ie trees and algae) and our actions, so the results that are often shown could be way off in either direction.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are essentially claiming that small changes in atmospheric CO2 are more impactful than variation in the sun&#39;s activity, changes in earth&#39;s orbit and axial tilt, volcanism, reflectivity, the composition of other gasses in the atmosphere, etc.</p>

<p>So why are you so hung up on CO2? Especially considering that CO2 levels have been more than 5X higher in the past? Clearly, atmospheric CO2 levels also change naturally, but human&#39;s marginal contribution is going to destroy the earth?</p>

<p>From the 1940s to the 1970s, Earth experienced a global cooling period, even while carbon-dioxide levels continuously rose. In the early 21st century, global temperature “paused” for 18 years, again during a period in which carbon-dioxide levels increased. <a href="http://blog.heartland.org/2017/07/contra-noaa-warming-pause-real-say-climate-alarmists/">Source</a></p>
