        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m going to be called a delusional sexist, or a crazy person, but whatever. I know I only have love in my heart and I don&#39;t care what these twisted SJWs say about me. They throw labels on everyone they disagree with, therefore &quot;branding&quot; that person and lumping them in with <em>actual</em> crazies, sexists or racists so no one will take them seriously out of fear of also being labeled. Ironically, the best way to censor people is by bullying them into censoring themselves. SJWs are truly masters at controlling the narrative.</p>

<p>I just want society to go back to normal. Not normal as in women having less rights again, but normal as in us not being socially engineered and led to our own graves.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The truth is men are being emasculated - chemically &amp; mentally. The slut revolution encourages single mothers dependent on the state (substitute father) while the slim margin of &#39;bad-boys&#39; run rampant and get all of the women.</p>

<p>In a nuclear family, most men were able to have access to sex but the modern 80/20 gap has become fact with actual data published by tinder &amp; okcupid. Men are now happy to fap away their creative energy in dark basements instead of taking any real action towards improvement. Wage slaves that work, game, fap, sleep &amp; repeat.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also noticed the corrupt, satanic media is in the beginning stages of normalizing pedophilia, incest and bestiality. Go to any mainstream porn site right now and half the videos on the front page will be &quot;Mom fucks son&quot; or &quot;Daddy fucks his little girl&quot;.</p>

<p>The goal is to break down the family, our morality, and our traditional gender roles so that we ultimately turn to our government for reliance and sense of belonging. It&#39;s a sterilization of sorts.</p>

<p>There is most definitely an agenda being played out before our eyes and 95% of the population either doesn&#39;t see it, refuses to see it, or even worse they do see it and flat out don&#39;t fucking care. Truly selfish, deviant times we&#39;re living in. Think about it? What the fuck does the USA as a collective even stand for anymore? Nothing. Literally nothing. We&#39;re in the finals stages of breaking down any decency and societal rules we have left.</p>

<p>Also, if you complain about any of this at all, you&#39;re called a loser, a virgin, a creep, etc. Men aren&#39;t allowed to complain about any issues, particularly gender related issues, even if it&#39;s a serious issue that impacts everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Society is fucked.</strong></p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s kind of like if you were growing up in an household. What would you do as soon as you grew up? You would get the hell out.</p>

<p>Often you start by getting some form of visa, spend time in the new country, see how you like it, then find out ways to obtain longer term visas or a passport. In some countries the only requirement is to own a house for over 5 years in their country then apply for citizenship. In others if you make a bank deposit in one of their banks for over $500,000, then you qualify for citizenship. </p>

<p>It IS possible to get out of a country that you feel is harming your future, and I recommend you research it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first step is to realize that you (your values, your thinking, your soul etc.) are under attack.</p>

<p>The second thing is to protect yourself from these attacks (porn, booze, drugs, vapid thought etc.)</p>

<p>The third thing is to lead your life in the best way that you can for yourself. The thing about sex and women is that if you can get a stable job and save money etc., the women will flock to you as they get older and realize that the bad boys do not care about them. Of course, you should not get stuck with their damaged goods and paying to raise their children. You should look for a girl who values the same sorts of things that you do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m drunk too, so here&#39;s my response.</p>

<p>Fundamental assumptions first. Society is and will always be a dominance hierarchy. Men are born with huge variability, women are born center bell curve. A man&#39;s optimal reproductive strategy is to fuck as many as possible. A women&#39;s is to find the highest quality sperm and raise with the safest possible provider (does not have to be same guy).</p>

<p>Why old school values? Because 1800&#39;s and below required a lot of workers. 95% of the male population had to be satisfied in order to willingly do that work, therefore, a forcible redistribution of women and a forcible commitment from men. A compromise between the sexes, as women in their natural state will seek out a fuck only from the top, and men in their natural state will kill each other to occupy top slots.</p>

<p>Why new school values? Because 21st century and above requires few workers. 95% of the male population can be discarded, while the best 5% from each batch can be used as new reproductive seed. Other animals discard and recycle by killing and eating the low quality males. We are more sophisticated. We offer a life of luxury, safety, and enslavement. Any who willingly submit to such a life are <em>by definition</em> low quality men. They jerk off in the corner until needed. The higher quality men fuck.</p>

<p>Then, when the women get pregnant with high quality seed, they collect those saved men from the junk bin and get them to raise the child. This process is getting streamlined with direct wealth transfers. Tax and redistribute through single mother programs. Free school, free lunch, provide for the poor unfortunate children. Who pays? The losers do. The ones who never got the fuck, never passed on genes. Grind up the discards and feed to the superiors. Throughout the course of their lives, almost 90% of their wealth is stolen. Income tax, tariffs, food, entertainment, drugs (alcohol, weeds, tobacco, prescriptions), market ignorance, inflation ignorance (buy bitcoin), you-can-negotiate-for-that-ignorance, healthcare, student loans, housing loans, car payments, speeding tickets, cost of regulation required by companies selling building and doing literally everything. Wealth is work. 90% of their work goes to the government, the government spends it on quelling the aggressive (military service, prisons), and redistributing to women who picked high quality sperm.</p>

<p>And honestly, it&#39;s the most efficient way to produce a better human crop.</p>

<p>You can make an argument that the global elite are pulling all the strings, for whatever satanic agenda they&#39;ve got going on. Or you can believe that this is simply the process of evolution. Countries that still enforce monogamy will soon be outperformed by countries that switch to 5% of men impregnating 100% of women at the expense of the bottom.</p>

<p>Isaac Newton did not produce offspring, was he a &quot;low quality man&quot;?</p>

<p>You are falling for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy">naturalistic fallacy</a>: &quot;if something is natural or deemed to be natural, it must be good or of high quality.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, you seem to have a 1-dimensional view of the &quot;utility&quot; of human life. What defines a human&#39;s value? Their IQ? Their level of training and specialization? Their ability to generate value for the economy? Their visual appeal?</p>

<p>These things may have correlations but certainly not a correlation of 1.0 (r<sup>2</sup> coefficient).</p>

<p>Or IOW, humans are not yet smart enough to assign a single number to a human that defines their value or potential value with 99% accuracy.</p>

<p>Obviously, you disagree with me and believe you are a genius who has figured out how to correctly value all humans. </p>

<p>What do I know, I&#39;m just some idiot with an MIT degree and 7 figures in the bank.</p>

<p>But if we went by the metrics for assessing human value you seem to enthusiastically &amp; uncritically push, I would probably be classed as &quot;objectively superior&quot; to you. Your metrics are pseudoscientific quackery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome rebuttal.</p>

<p>I may have vaguely implied that my own personal philosophy aligns with what I see as happening. That I somehow think it&#39;s good or bad. I think neither. I think it simply is. What I personally value in others, in myself, in life, has little bearing on what society in general values, or the direction we&#39;re headed.</p>

<p>And although I can completely understand how complicated it would be to quantify the value of a human life in philosophical terms, evolution makes things depressingly simple. If it passes on, it&#39;s good. End of story. </p>

<p>Most mammals have developed a complicated inter sexual dynamic to maximize reproductive efforts. The harsher the environment, the more specialized the sexes. Polar bears come to mind. The interesting thing about the bears it that reproduction is not a group effort, it&#39;s more of a war between the male and female. The male eats cubs, because chances are they aren&#39;t his and more food means more possibility to reproduce. That optimizes his repo, but not hers. The female protects the cubs from the bears, as she is 100% sure they <em>are</em> hers, and the investment is much higher. Value doesn&#39;t enter into it. It&#39;s a matter of what works for each individual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about people who explored Antarctica-- they weren&#39;t paid all that much.<br/>
Or people like the recent Grigori Perlman who solved one of the 7 most important math problems of the 21st century (the Poincare Conjecture)-- he straight up <strong>rejected</strong> the $1 million prize money. He lives a lower middle class lifestyle in his parents&#39; home in Russia, and I believe has passed up many high-paying university positions in order to simply tutor local students.<br/>
Or even guys who play in the NFL even <strong>after</strong> they&#39;re millionaires. They don&#39;t have to keep doing it, and it&#39;s risky (brain damage, spinal severing, etc), but they are going for a more abstract goal (making a mark in annals of sports).</p>

<p>So we have already a percentage of people who clearly override the basic biological drives (avoid danger, get food, get resources, find mate, protect children), and in engage in activities that unnecessarily endanger the security of those basic things.</p>

<p>The neocortex was the complete game changer. We are no longer programmatically 100% forced to go along with the program nature  had planned for us. Yes, there are risks from deviating from that plan (whether through willfully altering our behavior or through genetic engineering or through other means), but I think those are risks that are going to be taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The basic drive for men is to win. Money is a common way to determine winners, but not the only way.</p>

<p>High profile lawyers aren&#39;t pulling long hours because they have a specific yacht picked out that they really want to buy. They just want to out perform fucking Dave. Same for the explorers. They died, not because they really wanted to further whatever science was furthered by exploring the very cold place, they wanted <em>to beat the other teams and be the first</em>. Don&#39;t know about Grigori, but I imagine his sense of self worth came from figuring out problems. And maybe he was a great humble guy about it, but he was still driven by a desire to beat out the competition.</p>

<p>I am optimistic too. But for the entirely opposite reason. I don&#39;t see a society where men are learning how to chill out and read books and tutor kids for the good of the collective. I see the exact opposite.</p>

<p>There are some men who, if you put them in a forest with an ax, they would chop down every tree. We condemn those traits in youth. We teach boys to compromise and help each other and enjoy group projects. That&#39;s how we train our slave labor force. The select few who <em>refuse</em>, those who stay true to their drive, and the quality men who <em>lead</em> the slaves. And they are greatly rewarded. Most of the time with money. But some times with status. Or women. Or the love of a cult.</p>

<p>I went to church today to see one of my students play. The preacher talked about how we are helpless in a natural disaster (live in FL, irma fucked shit up). How we like to think we&#39;re independent, but in reality we&#39;re dependents. And our tech gives us little better than &quot;run away&quot; as a solution to true adversity. His message was &quot;stop bickering about money and status and love thy neighbor&quot;. I did church work for years. Preachers are well compensated. In both money and status.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you just said. The only thing I&#39;m really advocating for is freedom, and not preemptively closing the door on large groups of people because they don&#39;t fit our formula or preconceived ideas of the correct path of evolving towards a greatness.</p>

<p>I am not an altruist, nor a collectivist. In fact history proves that planned/farmed/controlled societies do not produce greatness at the same level or frequency (USSR, or even China (who recently became more capitalist but before then just copycatted the more innovative, capitalist West)).<br/>
For greatness or novelty that can be predictably manufactured is not really all that great. Real greatness goes beyond existing expectations, combines elements in unexpected, non-intuitive, unpredictable, and nonintuitively efficient ways.</p>

<p>So the very thing that eugenicists <em>claim</em> they want is objectively &amp; historically destroyed when they try to get it by taking away people&#39;s freedom-- whether by taxing people at 80% and redistributing to whatever group they prefer (be it single mothers, minorities, or corporate bailout executives), or through benevolent dictatorships of their preferred elite, or whatever.</p>

<p>In a sense, <em>Freedom is smarter than any given elite and their attempts at farming humans</em>, despite how clever they may think themselves to be.</p>

<p>You know where I see hate coming from? Is the people who are saying whites shouldn&#39;t reproduce, the people who are putting fliers up in universities saying &quot;It&#39;s Not Right to Date White.&quot;
&quot;White people aren&#39;t allowed to date other white people because we&#39;re supposed to date people of other races to basically get rid of our own race. &quot;
We&#39;re supposed to commit suicide, essentially. There&#39;s no race of people who are powerful enough to genocide us, so what they do instead is guilt us and shame us into suicide. Which is sick. And disgusting. And about the most hateful thing you could do to a people.
And at the same time as they express their vitriol toward us, they call us hateful for simply wishing to continue our survival and the survival of our descendants. <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKEz5ZfHtIQ">s</a></sup></p>

<p>Selfishness? If you don&#39;t take care of yourself, then nobody else fucking will, that&#39;s for damn sure? That&#39;s not to say being a brony or furry or whatever will lead to success in life, but I support people&#39;s freedom to pursue seemingly idiotic paths.</p>

<p>Just like I support Tara McCarthy&#39;s freedom to be a whiny parasite. If I didn&#39;t believe in individual freedom, I would simply use my (considerable) wealth to have her taken away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I don&#39;t necessarily agree 100%, I feel the same way about most of this. I&#39;m a 26 year old woman and what I think people are lacking the most these days are standards. I&#39;m very particular with who I become emotionally and physically invested, and nothing turns me off more than someone who would settle for anyone, really. Most guys I&#39;ve seen casually can&#39;t even tell you what they value in someone.  Of course we want someone funny, smart, and hot, but that&#39;s <em>it</em>? Really? Maybe I think about this too much, but I want someone that respects themselves enough to have deal breakers no matter how fine she is. </p>

<p>Same goes for women too. They will settle for anything it seems. They will compromise their feelings and &quot;go with the flow&quot; to make sure they&#39;re the cool chick, and because hook-up culture is &quot;the way things are today&quot;. If someone wants to just bang, that&#39;s fine, but my goodness..please stop saying you&#39;re &quot;cool&quot; with things if you&#39;re not. Ill be honest: it took me awhile to become comfortable putting my foot down, but I&#39;ve since found that it makes everything so much better. Its made the man open up more too and even if we end up on different pages, I have yet to experience a truly bad breakup where we didn&#39;t continue to respect and care about. </p>

<p>So yeah. All men are not evil monsters and all women are not sluts. Everyone is an individual and has life experiences different from anyone else. Be honest with what you want and respect that same honesty in someone else. Find out what&#39;s important to <em>you</em> and don&#39;t compromise yourself. It definitely drains the dating pool a bit, but it&#39;s just so much easier. No games, no weirdness, and lots of fun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be the bad boy type, and was pretty fixated on sex as a measure of my identity, but man was it a lot of work and drama. Ultimately it wasn&#39;t really about the sex, it was just about ego.  To be honest I&#39;ve never really enjoyed sex all that much and as I get older I care less and less about it.  So why would I put myself through the trouble of spending hours worth of my time in money for trendy clothes, a newer car; and then on top of that hours more of my time on the phone repeating the same trivial conversations, going through the motions over and over again, pretending I care about their problems, and for what?  To inflate my ego a little bit?  To prove to myself I&#39;m still desired?  To prove something to my peers?  I&#39;ve honestly always valued my close friendships more.  Dating has so many more ulterior motives.  You feel like you&#39;re always forced to be insincere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I would agree that Society is generally fucked...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the loss of &quot;core values&quot; such as marriage, or the rise of &quot;individualism&quot; is to blame.</p>

<p>In fact, one could and probably should argue the opposite.</p>

<p>Big government at the end of the day wants you broke and in debt.  Nothing will get you closer to that than getting married and having children. (Buying houses, cars, college accounts, food for kids etc.)</p>

<p>I do not think the skewing traditional gender roles really has any effect whatsoever on this &quot;society is fucked&quot; thing.  That really just screams that your worldview is too wholly embedded in Judeo-Christian Mythos.  If that&#39;s you&#39;re argument, fine.  But most of us are past that.</p>

<p>I do agree the corporate entertainment machine (disney and their ilk) continues to over-sexualize children&#39;s entertainment and just entertainment as a whole.  Every HBO episode has to have a goddamn sex scene.  However, I don&#39;t find it to be the main cause of society&#39;s downfall.  It is a symptom not a cause.</p>

<p>The cause is very obvious and all of us have been saying much of the same things for a long time:  Wealth/Power disparity. Lack of Transparency in government.</p>

<p>What i find more damning than any porn, drugs or transgenderism is the lazy mindlessness of the average American citizen. We have only so much time and energy in a given day to utilize.  Are we using that time to better society and ourselves, or are we not?</p>

<p>The answer is likely no.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the main stream pornography. Just doing research. Lol. But yeah I have noticed a major pick up in incest based videos. I mean. On PornHub the top videos or most views are incest themed pornography. Go into any milf section and it&#39;s littered with &quot;mom and son&quot; themed debauchery. It really is disgusting. </p>

<p>Another thing I&#39;m beginning to notice porn actors, the men that is..are skinny, no muscle, short, weird looking but have abnormally large genitalia. Now. There is nothing wrong with that. But. Get real if you think you can look like that and have sex with some of the women in porn. They&#39;re not goddesses but they are very attractive. Personally I think it&#39;s attempt to paint the ideal male body to be weak but hey you got a big you know what so you&#39;ll get it.</p>

<p>Bizarre times we live in. I will recommend if you are feeling lonely. Pick up some weights, start sprinting, clean up your diet and don&#39;t put women or men on a pedestal. We&#39;re all people. The opposite sex unconsciously values strength and mental clarity. Don&#39;t get frustrated. Put that energy into self improvement and bettering yourself. You will be much happier. </p>
