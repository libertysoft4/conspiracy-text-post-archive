        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve gotten banned of right wing sites just asking.  I think they thought I was from the left trying to make them look bad, idk.</p>

<p>Not about the Holocaust.  It does seem that the number is a lot lower than 6 million (that sentence gets you banned).</p>

<p>I mean why have dozens of Countries kicked the Jews out and have tried to kill them off but they are still around and are all over Hollywood so I know they have big connections and take part in world politics.</p>

<p>Where is the line drawn with Jews, being racist or actually asking honest questions?  I just want the truth regardless of what it means.  I want to know if someone is messing with me via ads or whatever, so why are so many Jews running banks and TV and also talking about Zionism?  You can&#39;t ask about Zionism anywhere on Reddit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s frustrating and makes me even more curious when this gets censored so much, almost like someone doesn&#39;t want something to be uncovered.  I don&#39;t know what other reason unless they think trolls are coming to make everyone on the right look like racists.  But the Jews are more taboo to talk about than black people, it&#39;s very strange.</p>

<p>Then you hear &quot;Hitler was right&quot; which does sound horrible, but why are they saying that?  </p>

<p>The media is crap and politicians even worse so I don&#39;t trust any history books.  I just learned about the Soviet Union killing 10 million+ then China killing 100 million+.  I was only taught about the Holacaust 6 million, lol and I graduated college with honors :D  Someone told me it&#39;s because of communism they took those out of history books.  Insane I&#39;m 35 and just learned about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Jew who works in finance and who talks to a lot of alt right and openly nazi people I will go ahead and take this one </p>

<p>First off, Jews where kicked out of a many European countries for a very simple reason- Jews do not accept the divinity of Jesus Christ. 
- this has often led to Jews being purged from European countries as heretical. If you look at the history of the Jewish communities being purged from Middle Ages period nations, the issue of Jesus was the primary issue.</p>

<p>The connection also associated with Jews and money is again based on this simple issue of Jews not worshiping Jesus. After the conversion of Constantine and the establishment of the Christian canon as we know it in 300ce, lending money with interest was banned between christians. Money lending was taboo since Ancient Rome since Ancient Carthage was a bank centered empire and it was at war with Rome. Constantine made the rules against banks part of Christian law.</p>

<p>Jews where considered a viable money lender and better then idol worshippers which where being made illegal in Anatolia. This set a precedent though of Jews as dirty and greedy </p>

<p>This tradition remained and was the premise of the Shakespeare play the merchant of Venice- the joke of it being set in Italy about a Jew money lender and his conversion to being a catholic, while in England at the time Catholics where banned and being burned as heretical. It was a deep play about money and god at the time.</p>

<p>As to why I personally went into law and finance it&#39;s because I find them very interesting fields and when I talk to a lot of white Christians they consider the fields very dull and often dirty and cruel- an example, I tripped and broke my leg in the home of a good friend, I sued him and I got $100,000 dollars because his front steps where built wrong. My Friend was Jewish and he felt no ill will to me for this. The money was paid by his homeowners insurance. He lost nothing.  I had many Christian friends outraged that I would sue him! They asked why I would do that?! How could I do that? 
- I did it because I understand how insurance works and so does my friend. He does not care and neither do I. 
- but to my Christian friends the idea that I would actually take the opportunity from my injury to make money was evil and I am evil, well fuck them, they are poor</p>

<p>And this is where the Hollywood and CEO stuff often comes from- i work to make money and advance myself. When I bring up that a white Christian is poor and a failure maybe needs to address the basic issue of himself his response to me is that he would beat me up or fuck my wife or I am a cuck bitch- that doesn&#39;t give him job skills or deal with that fact that he is poor because he sucks </p>

<p>As to why there is a general sensitivity about insulting the Jews I think it&#39;s more because there is a big desire to insult Jews so very badly!</p>

<p>Issues like Holocaust denial and the obsession of Israel causing 9/11 leads to some Jews simply tapping out of the whole conversation </p>

<p>I enjoy talking to ignorant people, I take screenshots of the things they say and pass it around my jobs, on this sub my favorite is lightbringerflex, he believes Jews are magical vampires named khazars and money is a conspiracy </p>

<p>My point is, if you want to hate Jews go ahead, but Jews have not done anything to you. Look at what you are doing in your life and figure it out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you covet money? Just because you know how insurance works does not make you better than a  person who does not give a shit about money, it just makes you seem greedy and opportunistic. Your friend felt no Ill will because I&#39;m sure you shared it between yourselves. Jesus was right, the usurers preyed on the less fortunate and you&#39;re defending the practice. I find your attitude distasteful and I bet your breath smells like shit cause you eat shit and you are what you eat. This has nothing to do with you being Jewish and everything to do with you being a moron.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think people are wastes of life for being poor? Ahaha! I&#39;m far from poor, only difference is that I made my honey honestly and didn&#39;t take advantage of a single human being to earn it. It&#39;s just a tool for material pleasure. Very basic stuff.<br/>
Nah I just see that if you think money is all that this world is about you&#39;ve managed to make it to the first hurdle. You sound old, which makes me think you&#39;ve gone quite a while stuck in the money matrix.<br/>
God made poor people. Did he make them on purpose just to go the hell? Are they such wastes of life that they don&#39;t deserve heaven? Do you feel the same about someone born into poverty? Who has no chance to even make it by from day one? What about Donald Trump? Billionaire. Great guy? Jeffrey Epstein is a billionaire. Great guy?<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no problem with Donald trump- he is just a real estate developer and tv star, seems like a fine guy </p>

<p>God makes baby&#39;s born with horrible defects who will only live to suffer and die- gods will be done </p>

<p>God makes poor people to live suffer and die- pointless futile lives that mean nothing- lives like yours </p>

<p>God makes people 100% on purpose just to torture and kill them- no karma, no lesson, no redemption- book of Job
God made all of Jobs children just to die to teach Job a lesson of humility- your life means nothing to god, god owes you no happiness, no wealth, and no lessons- because god did not owe you to even fucking be alive </p>

<p>Close your eyes- think about before you where born- that nothing- that&#39;s all there is as far as god gives a shit to you, if there is more- good or bad its a favor, and it&#39;s not a favor that you earn, it&#39;s their because god wills it or not- he gave us laws to follow- you decided to follow a false messiah preaching lies and eternal life saying all the bad things and good things happen because of touchy feely bullshit- but they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Donald trump is president and Jeffery Epstein will keep fucking on his Lolita express and there is no Christ </p>

<p>Only god will ever judge them because it&#39;s his plan, you hate his plan and curse his plan and worship the false idol of Karma- a lie! A false belief that their is any justice in this life or the next, that out understanding of the universe has to follow laws besides gods- you keep following that false song- keep worshiping at your false idols, and you will be what you always have- ignorant and poor </p>

<p>You are a waste of life and if you love your precious false god so deeply kill your self and run to him sooner, the dark void you seek awaits</p>

<p>I feel the modern day Christian prosperity gospel is far more Satanic then any Judaic philosophy </p>

<p>I said directly god gave a system of laws, those laws are judged by god- and only god is judge </p>

<p>You can be as spiritual as you want but it does not remove the fact that only god exists and any after life or effects in this life are controlled by god. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can believe anything you want </p>

<p>I believe in the Bible, written thousands of years before the king Constantine embraced the messiah cult that became your church </p>

<p>There is only god </p>

<p>God kills every baby that has cancer</p>

<p>God murders ever young mother just walking across the street with groceries when the driver was texting </p>

<p>God makes people lose their jobs and homes </p>

<p>God destroys economies </p>

<p>God makes men rape children </p>

<p>There is only god and his plan </p>

<p>God makes the bolder he himself can not lift only because he chooses not to lift it because he created the boulder and is the boulder and is the concept of lifting </p>

<p>No devil, no hell, no Armageddon- nothing </p>

<p>Just reconciling that every terrible thing in your life is his will, god acts in mysterious ways- he made me rich and made you poor
- he kills baby&#39;s in their mothers womb but john McCain lives to be 80</p>

<p>How you deal with it is up to you, I worship god, accept he is almighty and I am part of the universe he has made, I am grateful to be given the miracle of my life because he had no obligation to give me life, or Torah, or knowledge- but he did </p>

<p>You worship the false idol of Christ that promises you love and a universe that makes sense, it doesn&#39;t and it never will</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The parasites are people like you who feel owed anything from society at all- you are not owed anything! The social contract you cling to is a fucking lie.</p>

<p>The system is corrupt and always has been- I have no intention of obeying any stupid rules for your &quot;morals&quot; take your taxes, and your welfare and your social orders and shove them right up your ass</p>

<p>If you can avoid paying tax absolutely do so, if you can gain money ahead of others do it, if you can get a promotion get it, if you can flip your house then do it and fuck your precious stupid community- all of that shit is bullshit created by white Christians and the prosperity gospel to justify being poor</p>

<p>I am rich because I take opportunity when I see- I seize it and I get paid- no one is going to give you a fucking medal for being broke.
- fun fact! I am going with all my friends to the Winter Olympics in Korea in February. Guess my favorite thing to do after an Olympics? I buy people&#39;s medals and give them as fucking stocking stuffers lol- you might not know this but Olympic athletes are POOR and will sell their medals for cheap, look it up!
- so even if you get a fucking medal for all your hard work, if becomes MY fancy drink coster </p>

<p>Do you get that! Do you get that nothing you do fucking matters? That you are just working yourself to death while I party my ass off and live in luxury and you argue about JQ because you can&#39;t even figure out how to take a prep course and go to a good college!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have very mixed feelings about that example of you suing your friend there. Not sure where I&#39;ll conclude, but I&#39;ll preface with the fact I honestly don&#39;t care what religion you follow, and I&#39;ll just type as I think here.<br/>
So clearly you and your friend knew that through the suit your friend wouldn&#39;t lose any of his own money because of the insurance, which clearly works out for the best for you. In that sense it sounds smart, to take advantage of a predatory monetary system for your benefit, and not at the expense of your friend. But then again the objective concept of suing your friend because you had an accident in his home I feel is disgusting. Before addressing your knowledge of insurance, that is. Alone, it sounds like you&#39;re being heartless, cold, and clearly opportunistic. But then again, you knew of the insurance, so that point is negated. So you took advantage of the system, which in itself I&#39;d think is fine, but there&#39;s further implications. By suing for the reasons you have you encourage and validate the use and possible abuse of that aspect of the system, as is generally encouraged by corporate-capitalist interests who control America. And those sociopathic/psychopathic corporate interests usually abuse that aspect of the system in order to take from the poorest in society to further line their own pockets. So when I think of myself in that situation, despite the fact I know it wouldn&#39;t be hurting anyone immediate to me I&#39;d know it&#39;s propping up the evil system, so despite the profit I personally wouldn&#39;t do it.<br/>
Then again I never liked the concept of lawsuits in the first place because I disagree with the concept of debt based currency entirely. If I&#39;d support any monetary system it would have to be based on work effort or something like that. Something more real and tangible. A given amount of money per hours work if you know what l mean. Though ideally I&#39;d like a moneyless society (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4xeh91/sacred_economics_the_secret_to_eliminating_the_20/">sacred economics</a>).<br/>
So where did I wanna conclude? I understand exactly why you sued your mate, it made sense from your position. I don&#39;t agree with it based on something more personally fundamental, but I understand. I also think there&#39;s this problem where some people blame all Jews for the problems that the few corporate zionist &quot;Jews&quot; who created and run Israel made. It&#39;s like when people blame all Muslims for terrorism just because the few terrorists who exist call themselves Muslim. Or blame all white males because the people who&#39;ve ran and ruined the world just so happen to be white males. It&#39;s a false equivalency. I&#39;m reminded of that saying - which I can&#39;t remember exactly - but goes something like &quot;if you are going to identify with a group, but you don&#39;t speak out against those in the group who are abusing the system and others, then you are effectively complicit and supportive of that abuse.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you sir, that helps me understand a lot better.  I&#39;m for sure pro-Jewish but the only people to talk to about it are either very racist or they point me to long video&#39;s or books talking bad against Jews.   And it&#39;s only online; I&#39;ve never heard anyone say anything bad about Jewish people in person.  I just wanted to understand.  I mean Jesus was a Jewish teacher so it&#39;s strange anyone would hate Jews because of Jesus.  </p>

<p>I did watch &quot;The Greatest Story Never Told&quot; about Hitler and that does make a person wonder why so much is hidden from history.  Like with Hollacaust denial, I feel like some of the information like the exact number of Jews murdered being 1 million to 6 million.  But I can&#39;t even ask that question without being banned on 99% of reddit so I get confused why it&#39;s a topic that&#39;s not allowed.  </p>

<p>Everyone thinks it&#39;s billionaire Jews who are Zionists and want globalism and so much of that does look very real.  But from what I&#39;ve read people say they might not even be real Jews?  </p>

<p>And why do we only learn about WW2/Hollacaust in school and not about the Soviet Union killing 10 mill and China killing over 100 mil (according to Jordan Peterson&#39;s video I watched).  Someone told me thats because the rich/government wants communism so they don&#39;t want us to see how bad communism is.  And maybe people are taught about communism in school but I never was.  I still don&#39;t understand why communism caused so many deaths.  100 million???  How does a person kill that many people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually live in china and talk to a lot of people about the cultural revolution </p>

<p>The first reason you don&#39;t see it compares to the Holocaust is simply because of the mindset of what was happening- and this can be applied to Stalin as well though to a lesser degree.</p>

<p>Mao was definitely a monster and is great leap was corrupt and horrible and resulted in the deaths of 100 million Chinese people through starvation and disease- however at no point did Mao ever say- if I just kill enough Manchurians and Tibetans the the Han(maos ethnic group) would become SUPERMEN! 
- the Holocaust is a particularly horrible atrocity because it was so fundamentally insane, it was based on killing of lesser races so that German blood could be pure. That&#39;s ridiculous and that&#39;s why it&#39;s studied around the world. That&#39;s why Chinese people don&#39;t like it when they get lumped in with Hitler- they do not believe in the foundation concept. 
- the deaths of the cultural revolution was caused by the tragedy of communism- corruption and incompetence. Not the goal of creating a new superior race.</p>

<p>As to denial of the Holocaust in general I always point out that the Nazis never denied the Holocaust, nazi high command for the most part lived and gave details on exactly what occurred. Denial of the Holocaust did not become trendy till the 80s after many of these leaders died, particularly Albert Speers and Karl Donitz</p>

<p>Issues with numbers of dead with the Holocaust can often be attributed to, again, communism. Many of the death camps where taken control of by the communists and death tolls announced under the soviets. After the fall of the iron curtain Holocaust researchers where able to confirm how many people died at which place, again we have pretty good records of who died and when and where.</p>

<p>Zionism is a political view that Jews should have an independent state, that&#39;s it. It&#39;s held by many Jews and many Christians, currently Israel is at peace with every nation it has been at war with and has normalized relations with every middle eastern nation- this is the most accepted that the state of Israel has ever been, but if you listen to this sub you would believe America is going to invade it tomorrow. </p>

<p>I will say it again because it bears repeating- Jews are the great OTHER to Christians, they have been considered a dirty and greedy people for 2000 years, what you read about Jews are just new forms of ancient hate.</p>

<p>Very popular on this sub is the Khazar conspiracy where all Jews eat children and are actually a secret society of wizards- this is virtually identical to the blood libel where Middle Ages Christians chased Jews from their homes accusing them of eating missing children for blood sacrifice- it&#39;s the same shit</p>

<p>As you can see from the comments I received from discussion about suing my friend- that&#39;s considered a disgusting act in Christian society today. </p>

<p>At the end of the day most of the conversations I have with people who hate Jews, is based on the issue of white poverty which is now increasing. As white poverty rises hate of Jew will rise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, that make more sense.  More people need to read what you just wrote.  It&#39;s weird though because I never experienced people being mean to Jewish people but online you see it.  </p>

<p>Every Christian I know is pro-Jewish.  We do some of the festivals at my church.  It doesn&#39;t make much sense why anyone would murder groups of people, especially people who are supposed to love others more than themselves.  A big problem is back then the people never could read the Bible and the Catholic church had full control and led the people badly imo.  No one was ordered by Jesus or the Bible to kill anyone and those people are likely in hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like what you wrote and support your learning about your faith </p>

<p>I personally do not believe in Jesus or the concept of man sharing in the form of a Devine body, I just don&#39;t think of god in that fashion. </p>

<p>I also do not believe in a hell from the way I have learned of my faith, I believe in a single god as master of the universe and all aspects of that universe. No hell, no devil outside of the context of the story of Job, nothing- just god and his laws. </p>

<p>The Old Testament is a little harsher on rewarding good and punishing evil, remember that Moses does not reach Israel and is forced to live in exile. Similar sad fates happen to David and Solomon and most of the main figures of the Bible.</p>

<p>Regardless, most people I think don&#39;t actually hate Jews, I think the internet is just giving voice to a vocal group that really wants to blame someone for all the problems in the world- Jews have been that target for 2000 years, it&#39;s not new </p>

<p>Jewish proponents stirred up anti-German hatred in Austria till they started killing Germans in the territory gifted to them after WW1.</p>

<p>France used that as an excuse to declare war since it was pretty much controlled by the Jewish bankers. and businessman, many of which were ousted from Germany when the Nazi&#39;s paid off their debts, started a central bank, and kicked out all the scum that were ruining Germany since the end of WW1.</p>

<p>If Hitler really wanted to conquer Europe he would have cut a deal with Stalin, reinforced the proposed border, and use the incredibly vast industrial might of post WW2 Germany to out produce the Allies till the German scientists figured out the nuclear bomb, the jet fighter, and the intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>

<p>Instead Germany attacked Russia who they had a cease fire agreement with because They knew Stalin was evil and planned to invade Europe.</p>

Why were black people enslaved for so long, they must have been doing something bad right? Why did the Japanese slaughter the Chinese in Nanking? The Chinese must have done something to deserve it. Using the number of times Jews have been expelled from countries as an argument that they were up to nefarious plots is ridiculous when you follow that up by saying that the Jews control everything. If they control everything why did they allow themselves to be persecuted for so long? The fact is people have historically been shitty to each other for a lot of different reasons. </p>

<p>I did nothing illegal or immoral but white Christians are disgusted by the act- I have described the situation to people of other faiths and other ethnicities and they do not feel this universal disgust of the act. I feel that is why the WASP type are not fans of Jews and unless they are particular outliers not the best in the business and law worlds since there is just not a good culture for making money </p>
