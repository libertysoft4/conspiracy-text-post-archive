<p>The thread was a total shitshow of one of the strangest mixes of weird self righteous, but still sexually repressed, gender confused, emasculated, almost inverted rejection of some imaginary projected authority (the little girl and her shirt..) triggered almost violently but completely robotically against this image.</p>

<p>How 100 “grown men” spasmed into an hours long existential crisis was absolutely beyond any critical thinking. It was a the perfect example of the most subtly extreme social programming threads I’ve seen, honestly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope you&#39;re joking.... (username checks out)
Sterilization is wrong on many levels, let alone IQ meaning nothing much (some geniuses have done poorly on tests for example)
and the elites are not necessarily all that intelligent nor should intelligent benevolant people suffer for them.
Plus, where would we be without benevolant intelligent people?
We already get the fluoride neurotoxin in the water supply to dumb us down,
somehow I think intelligence genocide is a bad idea....lol.</p>

<p>We need more people to be intelligent including moral intelligence.
Our education is shit because of them.
The people who rule the world are psychopaths, sociopaths, (intelligent or not) bored scumbags, stuck up bastards, 
inbred morons, etc.</p>

<p>Apparently it all goes back to Babylonia and ancient Egypt or something.
Whether they use these religions/cults from back then, as an excuse
or truly believe in them (or an evil Luciferian version of them)
I don&#39;t know, but the difference between us and the elites is not intelligence, but ethics.</p>

<p>It&#39;s entirely possible to be an ethical businessman, banker, economy, ruler, etc. but unfortunately the elites are not benevolent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Top 10 comments so far are:</p>

<p>-No test. Education on child development and sex ed is better.
-Add basic child care to high school education.
-Free courses for soon to be parents and education in school.
-well-intentioned but unenforceable.
-Complete non-starter and ridiculous fantasy.
-Not good.
-Disagreement.
-I feel like the government would be overstepping its bounds
-Disagrees with premise.
-I&#39;d rather mandatory driving tests for the over 70&#39;s.</p>

<p>So how statist has it become? Is it statist for discussing the topic? Because the vast majority of people seem to think it&#39;s a bad idea.</p>
