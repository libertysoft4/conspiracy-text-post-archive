        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Truth is the only thing that  matters. </p>

<p>I got interested in conspiracy theories, because I realized that the normal mode of information I am getting are biased and are not a completely reliable source of information. </p>

<p>When the concept of conspiracy theories started, it was motivated with getting the truth.  Nowadays as it has gone more main stream, it has also been tainted with politics. </p>

<p>Politics has its own place, but it cannot supersede the truth. </p>

<p>The stated aim of a conspiracy theory culture shall be to know the truth, challenge it , refine it and again challenge it. </p>

<p>It is a scientific process, not a political one. </p>

<p>I lean right, but if I am following a conspiracy sub, I would be interested in knowing all the truth about any person on the right, no matter how much I support them.  If the truth challenges my ideological beliefs and my political position, that still remains the truth</p>

<p>Same goes for the left or any other political position.</p>

<p>It is ridiculous to challenge and redefine the truth due to political leanings. </p>

<p>If someone says something truthful but undesirable about someone or something we believe in, we shall look into the veracity of the claim, not how that claim makes us feel.  </p>

<p>The Truth doesn&#39;t care about feelings, it is neutral and that is what we shall seek, irrespective of the various social constructs that divide us. </p>

<p>Whatever you think you know about missiles, how did you learn it? Who told/showed you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not a military aeronautics engineer, so I don&#39;t know a lot about missiles to begin with. But when I wanted to learn more about their flight mechanics, I looked up some internet sources, <em>one of which I linked to you</em>. If you want to question information like that <em>without</em> having any practical reason to mistrust it, just because you don&#39;t trust anything: fine, that&#39;s your prerogative. That&#39;s not what the video was about. The video was very clearly saying &quot;Based on my own understanding of the principles of missile flight, I have a practical reason to mistrust this information&quot;, which I then called a waste of time because his understanding was incorrect in a pretty simple way. Thus, no practical reason for mistrust.</p>

<p>Retorting with &quot;well yeah but you should mistrust everything anyway&quot; is disingenuous goalpost-moving. That&#39;s not what the video was about. It was almost entirely about physics. Dumb, incorrect physics. If you want to make a point about epistemology, link a video about epistemology, not physics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The video clearly stats that the central question is how wingless missiles can fly parallel to the ground. It seems like you concede that they cannot, that they must &#39;fly at an angle&#39; for their flight to be physically possible. The question then becomes, how do we know that they can do that?</p>

<p>The honest answer must be, &#39;we don&#39;t&#39;. We either have faith in our governments and telescreens, or we do not. It seems to me like you do, which is fine by me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I maintain that truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect. That is my point of view, and I adhere to that absolutely and unconditionally. Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or to coerce people along any particular path. If you first understand that, then you will see how impossible it is to organize a belief. A belief is purely an individual matter, and you cannot and must not organize it. If you do, it becomes dead, crystallized; it becomes a creed, a sect, a religion, to be imposed on others.&quot; - Jiddu Krishnamurti</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. Thank you sir. I am very right leaning, but it still annoys the shit out of me when all I see is people attacking only left leaning politicians. The right has just as many, if not more scumbags on their side. I think any evil from either side needs to be exposed for the filth that they are. Thank you again and I wish more people shared your view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my first (and probably only) comment in this sub. I have been following for longer than I&#39;ve had an account though - not daily by any means, but periodically checking in and scrolling through. </p>

<p>I follow because I believe there is often more to a story than what meets the eye. Wading through the posts here sometimes complicates the matter at hand, but it nonetheless has me asking myself questions I wouldn&#39;t otherwise. I get excited easily and while I pride myself on asking thoughtful questions given time, my gut instinct is to think that &quot;something big is here&quot; with many posts - then I&#39;ll click and the comments (from people much smarter than me) will remind me of the basic rules of processing information. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned to not take it so seriously. And while I&#39;ll look at some of the political posts, it&#39;s not so much to gain intel for &quot;my side&quot; (I don&#39;t have one and am still trying to figure out exactly where my values lie on the current political spectrum), but to understand what the conversation is and what&#39;s happening outside of msm. I don&#39;t have cable, don&#39;t watch news sites, but am so inundated with posts on social media that I feel like I still do. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories are interesting. Sometimes people get super wrapped up in something that is really &quot;just a theory&quot; and toss humanity to the wayside. If they&#39;re wrong, that could mean they&#39;re invalidating the loss of someone&#39;s loved one. That&#39;s where my &quot;what&#39;s the spin&quot; side meets my own &quot;be a kind person&quot; side. </p>

<p>Dylann Roof (the Charleston shooter) lived in my town. All the major media outlets came here to shoot footage at our local WalMart and to talk to people that sat beside him in a high school class. (While I know it&#39;s irrelevant here, I really did know people who knew him, etc etc. It&#39;s SC. You know a handful of people, you know &#39;em all - heck, Peewee Gaskins worked for my family for a time). Anyway, I watched the posts here questioning the narrative - this is never a problem!  But questioning the existence of an event is where conspiracy theorists gain the bad reputation. It happened. How or why, I don&#39;t know.  But I realized then that it&#39;s so easy to doubt events that have happened outside of my own footprint. So easy. </p>

<p>Thankfully I&#39;ve not lost any close family members since I was a child, but I wholeheartedly believe that when I do, I won&#39;t be focused on taking photos of them in their casket to disprove people on the internet. The &quot;show me proof it didn&#39;t happen&quot; vs &quot;show me it did&quot; is what conspiracies are born of - it&#39;s not wrong, but it&#39;s helpful to remember context. </p>

<p>Whether that kid (or so many other people) happened to be one corrupted by a government agency can always be questioned. While it doesn&#39;t seem likely, it&#39;s certainly possible. And if that&#39;s correct? Well, we probably won&#39;t know in our lifetime. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how I got off on such a tangent but this post really hit home. I just wanna know. I just wanna understand how it all works. I wanna protect my kids. You wanna know too. And we can research and we can back stuff up and we can do amazing things with the internet and video and screenshots, but the truths that we&#39;re looking for - they won&#39;t be admitted. Not in our lifetime. The government and large corporation conspiracies (US), they&#39;re there, but it&#39;s highly unlikely that we&#39;ll have the proof to &quot;shock the world&quot;. The technology is already in place to invalidate everything every conspiracy theorist has ever said. To speculate and to question - never a bad thing. To raise concerns with others - I think it&#39;s great and do it regularly, softening the blow by starting with &quot;what if?&quot;  The thinkers are here, no question, but how do you market the ideas you have without coming across as <em>exactly</em> what the CIA hoped to accomplish with the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;? This is a tin-foil hat crew for all intents and purposes. It&#39;s not fair, but the extremists (as with every group) will identify the label. </p>

<p>That long mess said, kudos to you analyzers and thinkers. Just please don&#39;t forget to look up now and again- there&#39;s something new brewing every day outside your wheelhouse. And to OP, thanks. Let the truth prevail. </p>
