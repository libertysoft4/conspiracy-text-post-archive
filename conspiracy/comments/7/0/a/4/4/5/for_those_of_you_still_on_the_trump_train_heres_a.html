    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes it honestly feels like r/conspiracy has been hijacked by far right wing shills. Because conspiracy theorists happen to be more open to skepticism so they put out Hillary slams or Russian disinformation. </p>

<p>Thats how its perceived sometimes, I cant say for certain thats true. There is a lot of misinformation out there, but Ill see Breitbart articles that have nothing to do with a conspiracy. Just spitballing. Sometimes its hard to not get political, but sometimes if you really believe in a conspiracy you have to be a bit more tactful about it. Instead of just claiming Hillary should be in jail. Stuff like that isnt productive.</p>

<p>yeah, that&#39;s the belief system you have, I get it.    Just for your edification ... I had doubts about Trump&#39;s ability to win up until early June.  After that I said if it is a Clinton/Trump race he would win ...  I know, this is now not then and hindsight all that ... feel free to review my comment history if you need to.</p>

<p>Anyway, huuuuge differences exist between his original campaign and a reelection campaign.  Primarily ... he isn&#39;t an unknown anymore - now he&#39;s establishment; and that&#39;s a large negative in most of his supporters views.  Secondly, he&#39;ll have had eight years to thoroughly display his incompetence  ... perhaps his followers will start to realize that &quot;The Art of the Deal&quot; is primarily a book of self-aggrandizing fiction, and not valid business accumen.   Third, and actually more importantly, the DNC and GOP will have eight years planning to prevent his re-election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because most of those are either bad ideas or cant just be undone by the President. As Obama once said, &quot;I am not King.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of Trump, I dont think he really knows what hes doing because its dangerous when you start eliminating regulations without fully understanding the impact, but hes been unapologetic about regulations. He tried to get away with a Muslim ban lite bill. </p>

<p>I think his voters/supporters should have a come to jesus moment. Think about what you really want. Do you want a good life for most American families? Are you one who just wants less Mexicans to save the White majority? Do you really believe lowering taxes, like we have done numerous times, will be different this time? Why dont we instead compete with China by making our work environment better? They are a deregulation, sweatshop quality kind of work environment. They have gotten better, but still. We cant compete with that. We CAN invest in better infrastructure and protecting freedoms (internet as a utility) and opportunity (better eeducation, trade schools, skilled labor) rather than promote this race to the bottom for the people who will feel it the worst.</p>

<p>Just my two cents. </p>

<p>He campaigned on this. Republicans campaigned on this. Nobody pushed a good bill through for him to sign, but I doubt he actually intends to repeal it at all. The GOP &quot;repealed&quot; it several times in the House until it actually mattered.</p>

<p>Again, this has to be Congress.</p>

<p>Does he need a vote for this to happen? I&#39;m not sure what OP was getting at with this one.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This he can do himself. Under the unconstitutional &quot;AUMF&quot;, Trump, like Obama &amp; Bush, can withdraw troops just as easily as he puts them into unnecessary wars.</p>

<p>Congress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow man, I have to say I&#39;m impressed and I appreciate you giving that a fair assessment. I dont think I disagree much, I think I&#39;m just looking at some of those points differently.</p>

<p>So, China as a currency manipulator. Whether thats true or not the President can direct his Administration to address this however one might do so (Sec of Treasury, State Department, etc) But, I also would imagine a change in trade policy would be necessary which means Congress would have to get involved. He very well could just make a public statement, but if it boils down to how we conduct business with China, I think Congress, who regulates trade policy, would have to step in somewhere.</p>

<p>You are definitely right about the AUMF, <em>I think</em>, so I cant argue that.</p>

<p>The President appoints the Attorney General and the FBI Director, but they still <em>should</em> work independently. If their assessment is there is no possible prosecution against Hillary <em>that would stick because the laws are vague</em> then Trump would be obligated under oath to comply with their assessment. Otherwise we risk turning the DOJ into an arm of the President which would be very dangerous. So, the President doesnt have the authority to just say I wanna prosecute this individual. </p>

<p>I wasnt trying to be disingenious so I appreciate the critique. I may have been over thinking or &quot;under thinking&quot; the limits of Presidential authority. I&#39;m not a lawyer and I wont turn this into a debate on right or wrong. I rescind my original statement using the word <em>most</em> and change that to a more vague, &quot;I think some of those issues are more complicated and require congressional action.&quot; </p>

<p>Like the Secretary of Treasurer appointment, I&#39;m also not an economist. I understand classical liberal economic views, I just dont know on this one what you mean by him being a liberal. Like, if were only talking about economic policy, could deregulation be considered classically liberal? Or is it liberal to have regulations because to adheres to Constitutional supremacy which is liberal/conservative in nature.</p>

<p>I think that was a fair assessment man and that was really well reasoned. Part of my problem is that Congress and the President havent been doing a great job (past and present). So, AUMF or Congress addressing DACA properly. Its complicated and lawyers probably need to be involved here, but I think one thing we can all agree on is that its been a bit of a mess and would be nice if government bodies respected their authorities and duties under law. Good discussion man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response. I think the main problem with any president is that we&#39;ve allowed the office to assume too much authority. Congress gets to sit back and rake in the dollars while abdicating their Constitutional role. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not a king, and shouldn&#39;t be allowed to act like one, you&#39;re right. And, most of those things I said he could do, he shouldn&#39;t be allowed. Yet, because his predecessors did, he can. (Like the Iran deal. The Senate even tried to vote against it, but the Dems shut that down in procedure.)</p>

<p>Until the presidency is reigned in (and it would take someone WAY more qualified than Trump), we&#39;ll be stuck in the whole &quot;can he really do that&quot; mentality. And Congress will probably shrug, &quot;Yeah, why not?&quot;</p>
