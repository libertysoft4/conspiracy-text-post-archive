        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s get this straight. This sub is being subject to divide and conquer attacks from the left and right.</p>

<p>Pro clinton shills/bots are pretty obvious here and one just needs to look at the bottom of the comments section of top posts to see them.</p>

<p>Pro trump shills apparently are also on the rise trying to praise trump as some sort of untouchable god by downvoting and attacking anything that criticizes trump, regardless of legit or not. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll ask this question: What did Hillary or Trump did in their entire political career save for waging wars overseas and disrupting the order of the states to the point of civil war and global chaos? Did Hillary actually give women rights? Did trump actually enforce stricter laws on immigration? Did anything EVEN change? </p>

<p>Or i will ask you this question. DID Trump take any action against Hillary after he is president? Did he take action against the endless stream of mainstream media and communist revolutionary terrorism AROUND THE COUNTRY?</p>

<p>This is divide and conquer and it is their tactic of removing this sub. Keeping the left and right fighting until no consensus can be performed. That said they will be happy to give every archive of this sub to Geneva and mark people for mass purging by united nations troops in the future.</p>

<p>Nothing will change no matter who is the president, and we are losing all our rights with self compliance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Always the same message. Hate Trump. He is no different. </p>

<p>Yours is a message of division disguised as being against division. </p>

<p>Trump stopped the creation of the one world government. That is why the deep state and their minions are so against him. They worked on this plan for generations and now you can see their anger and failure with your own eyes. The flood gate of immigration slowed drastically just by him becoming president and stopped the world government economic structure the TPP. These 2 things were to drastically lower wages and living standards to make countries more even to be easier to govern economically for the world government. He has opposed the carbon tax schemes which was going to be the world government tax system that gave the world government full control of all business, manufacturing, transportation, and power utility. He rolled back the infrastructure set up for the FCC to regulate and censor the internet. The world government&#39;s plans are now in shambles.   </p>

<p>We know who is driving the division. </p>

<p><strong>The media</strong> has been running 2 minutes of anti-Trump hate propaganda every single day for a year now (1984 reference). They have been the ones spinning and amplifying the racial tension, making false statement, and brainwashing with it&#39;s most effective form, repetition.   </p>

<p><strong>The Soros groups</strong> have been the outlet for anger and violence for those that are mad about the world but to gullible or stupid to understand who to be mad at. They have now become the enforcers like Mussolini&#39;s Black Shirts or Hitler&#39;s Brown Shirts.</p>

<p><strong>Indivisable</strong> with their mandate to Stall the Trump agenda by forcing them to redirect energy away from their priorities. Sap Representatives’ will to support or drive reactionary change. Reaffirm (create the illusion of) the illegitimacy of the Trump agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Shareblue and CTR</strong> with their social media and reddit propaganda teams who&#39;s job it is to turn people against Trump at all cost. </p>

<p>But I do believe I read that Soros&#39; funds some nonprofit that has directly funded Antifa. For the life of me I can&#39;t find the source, but I know I read it, and if anyone can assist with researching that, wonderful.</p>

<p>Btw I DO NOT agree with OP that Trump &quot;stopped the creation of the one world government&quot;.</p>

<p>Do you know what I see <em>more</em> than Pro Clinton shills or Pro Trump shills? I see more accusations of shills than actual shilling. Sure, you are right that they do exist. But I would argue that as a percentage of commenters it is extremely small.</p>

<p>What we actually have is real people arguing their real perspectives. One thing we can do to bridge this divide and play against the powers that be, is stop with all of the accusing and converse on actual points without resorting to yelling Shill. I&#39;m not saying this is what you do OP. This is just what I see when I read the comments in many conspiracy threads.</p>

<p>I wish us all luck with moving beyond the divide. I will continue to browse /new and throw my upvotes or downvotes where I choose and help to have a little influence on this board.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And nobody posts pro Clinton threads, or defends Clinton.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the big distinction here. Nobody is defending Clinton, but there are a shitload of people defending Trump even though he&#39;s the president and Clinton is running around whining about her loss and trying to sell books.</p>

<p>And yet every fucking day a dozen or more new anti Clinton politically based threads pop up, and many of them get propelled to the front page even though they don&#39;t relate to any conspiracy and often times even if they are conspiracy related it&#39;s old, old news.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I attack the comments. It&#39;s a handful of accounts and bots using this sub for partisan political bullshit. I could care less about Hillary Clinton, I think she&#39;s horrible and I&#39;m glad she lost......... But at the same time, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that there is an ongoing organized effort in this sub to turn it into a TD echo chamber. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im just amazed at the amount of people in the sub who still think trump is here to save the day and is not like everyone else. Thats the only thing that baffles me. When i see the anti left or anti right posts im just like people still think there is a difference? Onoy when it becomes obvious that there is none can the conversation move to the next level. This sub will get there one day.</p>

<p>The people are still choosing team Red and/or team Blue.  What they don&#39;t realize, is that it&#39;s the governments team vs. the peoples team.  </p>

<p>Only until it affects American pocketbooks, people in the US will continue living in their bubble or working M-F, whilst spending money and pretending to be something more financially on the weekends.  People graduating from Clown University and joining that Rat Race! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen. I say we force them to back into a corner by introduced something like the single transferable vote system. If something like the STV system doesn&#39;t result in a more representative democracy, it would have to be due to vote rigging (which a lot of us suspect is going on anyway, hence the backing them into a corner) since STV is a mathematically proven superior form of representation.</p>
