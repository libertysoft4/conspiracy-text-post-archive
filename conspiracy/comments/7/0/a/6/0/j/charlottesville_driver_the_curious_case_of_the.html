        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>James Fields was the white whale the MSM was desperately searching for to boost the narrative that Islam has nothing to do with terror.  White men are just as bad and we finally have it on video with a dead girl. It was a perfect setup for the media to expose his entire history of life thus incriminating every connection, potential influence he had.  Where were the lengthy segments on  Fields listening to Hannity/Rush, the toxic masculinity of his FPS video games, his school records?  Anything they could find to use him as a bludgeoning tool to berate conservative America should have been there. </p>

<p>While the attacks on Trump took center stage, Fields became a ghost.  Who was he? The next Timothy McVeigh? Or was he simply a prop in a psy-op that fizzled out too quickly? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The concerted focus on Fields seems to fade on or after August 16th.  Wall to wall Coverage on Harvey starts August 24th.  8 days is a lifetime in media cycles.  The media went after Trump hard post Charlottesville.  Fields could have been a useful thread to connect to White Supremacy/Trump narrative that was dominant.  I think the media wasn&#39;t getting what they wanted by digging into Fields past.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points.  The most obvious conspiracies are the lone assassins, shooters that die before a trial, where a defense lawyer has the process of discovery on behalf of his client.  For whatever reason I get the sense the media faded on the guy because something in the background wasn&#39;t a slam dunk for their narrative.  That&#39;s the softest touch on the subject I can present, before we go full down the rabbit hole.  </p>

<p>Lots of Leftist &quot;masquerading as the Other Side&quot; nonsense. It&#39;s right in Saul Alinski&#39;s &quot;Rules for Radicals&quot;. He straight up says, &quot;Do not argue with your opponent (he might win). Instead, dress up in a KKK outfit and show up at one of his speeches, pretending to be a supporter&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what could constitute proof to you?</p>

<p>If I videotaped her telling you what she told me, you&#39;d simply say she was lying.</p>

<p>If I got a sworn affidavit, you&#39;d simply say I made it up.</p>

<p>If I gave you a paper trail (like the one where Soros front companies were paying actors $25/hour to masquerade as white nationalists) you&#39;d claim that it was fraudulent.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing with you: I can give you direct quotes from Saul Alinski&#39;s <em>Rules for Radicals</em> about discrediting opponents by dressing up as Klansmen. I can provide you with photos of Antifa dressing up in fake white nationalist outfits. I can give you the Craigslist ad where they were hiring actors before the event.</p>

<p>And it will never be enough for you to admit that your narrative is debunked.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even believe in proof or evidence. Logic is part of the &quot;white patriarchy,&quot; right?</p>

<p>Your side is emotion-based.</p>

<p>Emotion-based people don&#39;t accept logic, reason or evidence.</p>

<p>So stop pretending as if you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think its not in response to, but more of a preventative measure.  They want complete control of the narrative.  </p>

<p>&quot;It recently revised a “Press Release and Public Information Policy” that provides guidance for police officers regarding how, what, and when information should be given to the press and public. The revisions came in July, and local journalists aren’t happy.
“The policy leaves it up to individual state troopers to determine what is news and what isn’t,” Michael Donoghue, the executive director of the Vermont Press Association, tells CJR. “Crimes, including sexual assaults, armed robberies, arsons, burglaries, embezzlements, drugs, and more are not required to be disclosed. Vermonters want to know if they are safe in their homes and out on the streets.”</p>

<p>The new policy [PDF] prefers ambiguity to clarity and transparency. Worse, it allows officers and police officials to make subjective calls on newsworthiness, which is obviously going to make policing the police that much more difficult. This part is particularly problematic, as it restricts dissemination of information to that which is subjectively defined as &quot;significant public interest.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The concerted focus on Fields seems to fade on or after August 16th.  Wall to wall Coverage on Harvey starts August 24th.  8 days is a lifetime in media cycles.  The media went after Trump hard post Charlottesville.  Fields could have been a useful thread to connect to White Supremacy/Trump narrative that was dominant.  I think the media wasn&#39;t getting what they wanted by digging into Fields past.  </p>
