The attack, carried out on the ground and by air, destroyed more than 35 blocks of the district, at the time the wealthiest black community in the nation. More than 800 people were admitted to hospitals and more than 6,000 black residents were arrested and detained, many for several days. The Oklahoma Bureau of Vital Statistics officially recorded 39 dead, but the American Red Cross estimated 300, a number supported by historians since then.</a></p></li>

<p>Human experimentation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#1950s">From 1963 to 1966, Saul Krugman of New York University promised the parents of mentally disabled children that their children would be enrolled into Willowbrook in exchange for signing a consent form for procedures that he claimed were &quot;vaccinations.&quot; In reality, the procedures involved deliberately infecting children with viral hepatitis by feeding them an extract made from the feces of patients infected with the disease</a> (There is a lot of stuff in this link)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#Experiments_involving_other_radioactive_materials">Immediately after World War II, researchers at Vanderbilt University gave 829 pregnant mothers in Tennessee what they were told were &quot;vitamin drinks&quot; that would improve the health of their babies. The mixtures contained radioactive iron and the researchers were determining how fast the radioisotope crossed into the placenta. At least three children are known to have died from the experiments, from cancers and leukemia</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/apr/21/uk.medicalscience">The Ministry of Defence turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public. A government report provides for the first time a comprehensive official history of Britain&#39;s biological weapons trials between 1940 and 1979</a></p></li>

The boys were also given radioactive oatmeal in a study for Quaker Oats.</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/7236099/Human-bones-could-reveal-truth-of-Japans-Unit-731-experiments.html">The Imperial Japanese Army&#39;s notorious medical research team carried out secret human experiments regarded as some of the worst war crimes in history. Its scientists subjected more than 10,000 people per year to grotesque Josef Mengele-style torture in the name of science, including captured Russian soldiers and downed American aircrews. The experiments included hanging people upside down until they choked, burying them alive, injecting air into their veins and placing them in high-pressure chambers.</a></p></li>

<p>Science Whistleblowers and information about little known problems in science: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Reproducibility in science is not very sexy. Because our scientific culture generally rewards innovation over cautiousness, replicating a study conducted by others will not get a researcher a publication in a high-end journal, a splashy headline in a newspaper, or a large funding grant from the government. Only an estimated <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/reproduce-or-bust-bringing-reproducibility-back-to-center-stage/">0.15% of all published results are direct replications of previous studies.</a>&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, recently wrote: <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf">“Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”.</a></p></li>
<li><p>In 2009, Dr. Marcia Angell of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote: <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/">“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.”</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;I can&#39;t tell you exactly what percentage of the trials are flawed, but I think the problem is far bigger than you imagine, and getting worse...it is so easy to manipulate data, conceal it or fabricate it...there is almost a code of silence not to speak about it.&quot; -<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/spiegel-interview-with-whistleblower-doctor-peter-wilmshurst-a-1052159.html">Whistleblower Dr. Peter Wilmshurst</a></p></li>

<li><p>Nature: More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist&#39;s experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews">40 percent of scientists admit that fraud always or often contributes to irreproducible findings.</a> </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The neuroscientific community needs to challenge the current scientific model driven by dysfunctional research practices tacitly encouraged by the <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-09/aof-rnw092515.php">&#39;publish or perish&#39; doctrine, which is precisely leading to the low reliability and the high discrepancy of results.&quot;</a></p></li>

<li><p>Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.
One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/">All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic.</a> </p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/09/fda.scientists/">Nine scientists at the Food and Drug Administration have written a letter to President-elect Barack Obama and his transition team, alleging gross mismanagement at the agency that has &quot;placed the American public at risk. The agency is &quot;fundamentally broken&quot; and &quot;failing to fulfill its mission,&quot; according to a copy of the six-page letter obtained by CNN.</a></p></li>

<li><p>Chicago Tribune: 11,000 Crestwood, Illinois residents were knowingly given tapwater contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals for 40 years.

<li><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/us/17water.html">New York Times:</a> &quot;The Safe Drinking Water Act is so out of date that the water Americans drink can pose what scientists say are serious health risks — and still be legal. Only 91 contaminants are regulated by the Act, yet more than 60,000 chemicals are used within the United States, according to EPA estimates.&quot; </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/03/AR2010010302110.html">Washington Post</a> Of the 84,000 chemicals in commercial use in the United States -- from flame retardants in furniture to household cleaners -- nearly 20 percent are secret, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, their names and physical properties guarded from consumers and virtually all public officials under a little-known federal provision. The policy was designed 33 years ago to protect trade secrets in a highly competitive industry. But critics -- including the Obama administration -- say the secrecy has grown out of control, making it impossible for regulators to control potential dangers or for consumers to know which toxic substances they might be exposed to.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/14/hsbc-money-laundering-fine-management">The US department of justice said HSBC had moved $881m for two drug cartels in Mexico and Colombia and accepted $15bn in unexplained &quot;bulk cash&quot;, across the bank&#39;s counters in Mexico, Russia and other countries.

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 being a government conspiracy doesn&#39;t have to depend on speculative aspects like controlled demolition or ridiculous theories like no-planes. al-Qaeda being a CIA asset has already been confirmed by Sibel Edmonds, who blew the whistle on Operation Gladio B. There was even a wire transfer of $100,000 to lead hijacker Mohammed Atta ordered by the Pakistani ISI, which was the CIA&#39;s intermediary for funding the Afghan mujahideen during the Cold War. Daniel Hopsicker did great work investigating the flight school in Venice FL where Mohammed Atta trained, finding that owner Rudi Dekkers and financier Wally Hilliard had intelligence connections. Mike Ruppert made a good case for the war games on 9/11 being intentionally planned and run by Dick Cheney to thwart the air defense.</p>

<li><p>The ISI wire transfer was first published by <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-helped-FBI-trace-ISI-terrorist-links/articleshow/1454238160.cms"><em>Times of India</em></a>, and confirmed by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050919151422/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/south/10/08/india.ressa/">CNN</a>, <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/911timeline/2001/afp101001.html"><em>Agence France-Presse</em></a>, and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011108121949/http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/01oct18/news.htm"><em>Daily Excelsior</em></a></p></li>
<li><p>Daniel Hopsicker has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6W4L-HK-Os">documentary about the flight schools</a>, based on his book <em>Welcome to Terrorland</em>. There&#39;s some controversy over whether he accurately identified Atta&#39;s girlfriend, but that doesn&#39;t threaten his other conclusions; Hopsicker went out into the field and talked to people who were involved with the flight schools. His website, Mad Cow, has more stories on this, including how the flight school&#39;s planes were used to smuggle drugs.</p></li>
<li><p>Mike Ruppert, in his book <em>Crossing the Rubicon</em>, documented 5 separate war games running on September 11. Some of them drew fighters away from the Northeast US, and others created confusion as to whether the hijackings were real or not. There was also some faulty radar data about flight 11, which Ruppert believes was inserted through a backdoor into the FAA systems. FAA computer systems were subcontracted out to Ptech, a firm funded by Yasin al-Qadi, a terror financier who claims to have met Dick Cheney in Saudi Arabia.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Building 7 is all anyone really needs.  &quot;Uh yea, that building across the way from where the planes hit?  Well, a rock from the falling towers hit it on there way down, and wouldn&#39;t ya know, the darn thing just collapsed in demolition style straight into its own foundation.  Haha, it&#39;s the damndest thing...&quot;  </p>

<p>I&#39;m also not a big fan of Trump, I think he&#39;s really funny in that Al Bundy/Jerry Springer way and not much else, but I think he knows what happened on 9/11.  He hinted <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-bizarre-quotes-911-attacks-tallest-building-higher-ratings-muslims-cheering-george-w-a7940516.html">A LOT</a> before the election that he knew exactly what went down.  Even though he&#39;s a shnook, his expertise in at least large-scale construction and demolition was well known in the city at that time, and I think he was at least consulted about demolishing the towers.  Even hypothetically.  He was also right there on the day after int happened going &quot;no way this was planes, this is exactly what controlled demolition looks like.  I&#39;m in construction.&quot;     </p>

There is a certain threshold a person or source reaches, almost like a cliff, where they are wrong or lie often enough in comparison to the number of times they are correct or tell the truth that regardless of whether they&#39;re telling the truth or not, their previous behavior has rendered them an untrustworthy and thus invalid source for information.</p>

<p>I get that not many people agree with that, let alone on this subreddit specifically, but that&#39;s how I choose to operate. Donald Trump passed that threshold for me a long time ago, even before his most recent presidential run and win.</p>

<p>I like Trump, on a lot of levels. There are things I disagree with or am concerned about. But, as a whole, I like the guy. And that&#39;s me. I have my reasons :) your reasons are your own, and from where you sit, it&#39;s accurate too. (Honestly, as long as <em>ANY</em> president doesn&#39;t blow up the earth or totally fubar America, it&#39;s gonna be okay, it&#39;s only 4-8years, and not truly that long.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just an aside. My ex-husband worked in the Fernald school . . . while he was in prison. They hire inmates who are eligible for daily work details to work with the kids. Fortunately, for those kids, my ex was a decent guy. I can only imagine some of the guys that end up working there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you explain what exactly is so bad about this? You make it sound like they are leaving kids alone with possibly violent inmates. I doubt all inmates can qualify for this and I think it can be quite therapeutic actually. Inmates and children both tend to be very lonely, so they have that in common.  I think it would be educational for kids to learn about the reality of life and how it can go wrong for anyone. Especially if learning while they are in a safe environment like school. Even if they dont talk about life lessons, they can just have a friend, someone to talk to. I also dont think all inmates are bad people. And they dont deserve the cruel punishments they get, like solitary confinement. Am I crazy here, or do you have more to add?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not all inmates are bad people. My ex certainly isn&#39;t. As far as learning the reality of life from the inmates, I don&#39;t know how that may be applicable since the Fernald school is for severely mentally challenged kids. Learning to brush their teeth each day is a challenge. Hiring inmates, at $2.00/day is how the school keeps its costs down. And yeah, some of the guys that worked there from the prisons weren&#39;t the kind you&#39;d want around your kids, i.e. armed robberies, assaults, etc. The prison they pulled from was a minimum security so the inmates were at the end of their sentences at that time. I guess it&#39;s part of how they planned to reintegrate them, by giving them work experience. So, regardless of your original crime if in that prison you were considered trustworthy enough for a job. Doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;d rehabilitated, only that they played the game well enough to make it that far. Again, not all were like that, but some certainly were.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to be confrontational, just an attempt to point out to you <em>why</em> you are not getting what I am saying lol. I figured that was more important than clearing the cereal point up.</p>

<p>But, well in a nutshell:</p>

<p>PBS (Or I guess the FDA where you are) is gvmnt funded as a service for the <strong>entire population</strong>. If you wanted test trials to be totally death free you&#39;d be asking a ridiculous thing, that could only be done if the cost (in taxpayer dollars) of the whole operation went up for no actual benefit to anyone.</p>

<p>Just how if cereal for the <strong>entire population</strong> was made insect leg free for an extra $6 on top of what it already is, it would be a huge waste of everyones money because it&#39;s already fine as it is, unless you are illogically squeamish.</p>

<p>Basically, me writing all this out makes me question why the fuck I spend so much time on the internet typing shit out, I guess I&#39;ll say this is the last time I do that shit lol... it&#39;s time for me to find a new way to spend my fkn time..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And we knew that we had been lied to before so that we could enter a war.  This happened with Vietnam as well.  But we don&#39;t learn.  I remember seeing and hearing that testimony everywhere and something just seemed off about it.  But I was 14 and I lacked the experience and knowledge to go any further than that.  But I remember thinking that she was full of shit.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmfVs3WaE9Y">video</a>  What do you think, does she sound genuine to you?  I now realize that we needed an excuse for war and her testimony was part of that excuse.  Then we used WMD&#39;s as an excuse some years later which resulted in a war on &quot;terror&quot; which has an ever changing enemy face and no clear end.</p>

<p>So I look at the world today and I see NK being painted as our enemy.  Right or wrong, that is not my point here.  My point is that we have an opportunity here for history to repeat itself.  The UN General Assembly is happening and I can&#39;t help but wonder what the plan might be to gain support for military action against NK.  Will this plan include embellished propaganda or even an outright false flag?  Our history would tell us that we need to be aware and question the narrative before making rash decisions.  But who am I kidding?  Those of us who question things in this manner are not the ones controlling the narrative and we are not the ones making meaningful decisions.  Those who recognize our past and question the present will be dissenters and we will be ridiculed and ignored.  Then we will one day wonder how we were so stupid ..  again.  I give it 12 months, max.  Within 12 months, we will have an event that will be plastered on every news feed and they all will be saying the same thing.  When this happens, we need to question it.</p>

<p>Slightly off topic, but I am also concerned about the rise of extremism on both the left and the right.  We had this situation in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s with groups like the Weathermen who were blowing things up in America on a daily basis.  These groups did not go from nothing to blowing things up overnight.  There was a gradual and well documented increase in their numbers and the violence of their tactics.  Then we woke up one day and wondered how it came to bombs everyday when it was playing out right in front of us the whole time.  So now we have our escalating situation today.  Extremist groups and numbers are up.  The violence has started and we have done little to recognize this unless it fits a certain narrative.  So I worry that we are repeating history again.  An escalation of violence is the only logical progression from here.  And here we are being selective in who we condemn and doing very little to address the issue in a meaningful way.  Todays extremists are not so bomb happy, but for how long?  Why can&#39;t we wake up before our reality slaps us in the face, or blows up in our face?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism, in and of itself is neither bad nor good; it is the implementation that matters.  A government truly invested in the interests of the people is the missing counterbalance.  We want the energy of the capitalistic enterprise under the hood but we need responsible government behind the wheel.</p>

<p>For example.</p>

<p>Government subsidies.  These are inducements from the government to encourage wanted behavior.  This might be subsidies for green investments, for example.  Conversely, taxation is a deterrent.  A properly functioning government should be able to use inducements and impediments to guide the interests of capitalism to those areas that are lawful, productive and available; sourcing the most easily optimized parts first and taxing the resulting economic growth.</p>

Did you know that most social scientists and anthropologist agree that (non-sociopathic) humans work better with the motivation of helping eachother, than that of personal gain? 
Communism is human nature. Capitalism divides humans into groups in order for further extortion of the very people that produce everything (the proletariat).

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism is based around the idea that the individual should accumulate capital, money. What happens is some of these become so rich they create companies and corporations that produce goods, and compete for it (competition makes prices low, and wages higher).
So basically the rich dudes invest in the market to become richer, and in doing so they enrich the consumers.</p>

<p>Corporatism is when multiple corporations are allowed (by the government, through regulations) to lobby. (here i&#39;ve been writing for a good 2 minutes before realizing i could just link you to a [video[(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DxXHh-p-O4)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DxXHh-p-O4)</a>) <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/krqD7dO2xU4/maxresdefault.jpg">This</a> is another pretty big example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before continuing the discussion i&#39;d like to clarify i don&#39;t see capitalism as the best system possible. I&#39;d argue some form of voluntarism/anarchy would best for our current situation, but the jump seems hard right now, a free capitalist market is way easier to grasp.</p>

<p>Second thing is we&#39;re on r/conspiracy, so you well know that the problem isn&#39;t the economic model: the government gets lobbied because it allows it. The problem lies in the privatization of banks and their relations with other influencers (CEOs and politicians). Most systems would automatically fix themselves without poison in them.</p>

<p>Regulations are capitalism&#39;s poison. A free market, in which consumers can effectively choose who to buy goods from (not from a &quot;team of corporations&quot;) is good for everyone. The richer the producers get, the more they invest the more wealth (this is a keyword: wealth doesn&#39;t equal money) is produced.</p>

<p>They have no choice in the matter. Lobbying the government is free, protected speech. </p>

<p>Without regulation, the rich and powerful would do want they want unrestricted. Getting rid of regulations would fix nothing. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you live, but I can make my own consumer choices. I don&#39;t have to buy from a team of corporations if I don&#39;t want to. Yeah certain things like gas, electricity, etc are a lot harder to get without dealing with a corporation, but its possible to go without gas. You can go off the grid for electricity.</p>

<p>Nope nope: if the government gets asked to &quot;buy my product &#39;cause there&#39;s many of us see? We can help you!&quot; it should deny the offer and investigate the group. Our government <strong>allows itself to be lobbied</strong>. Again, you should know why...</p>

<p><em>Some even believe we [Rockefeller family] are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - One World, if you will.If that&#39;s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.</em> (David Rockefeller, Memoirs.)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Corporatism is subtle, you as the consumer can&#39;t know who the team is made of. Yeah sure you&#39;re less likely to buy the highest price product, but if you fall into a marketplace that is &quot;allied&quot; with others (thus creating a hidden monopoly) the prices will always be higher, and wages always lower!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To make the Greenwood situation in Tulsa even worse, the Greenwood area was relabeled Brady District long ago after Wyatt Brady, a known KKK member. The district has recently blossomed/gentrified and due to backlash over the Brady name in the last few years, the local business association has decided to rename it. They announced the list of final 3 choices for the public to vote on. Whats not on the finalist list? Greenwood, although I would wager that if Greenwood was on the list it would win in a landslide.</p>

<p>Projection. I don&#39;t take kindly to projection from gatekeepers who refuse to address a proven conspiracy. As a gatekeeper YOU decide the criteria of a proven conspiracy. That&#39;s what gatekeepers do! It&#39;s the definition of gatekeeping!!</p>

<p>but beyond that I cannot think of any other conspiracies - &quot;I know about&quot; to enough of a degree that I feel confident to talk knowledgably on the topic.</p>

<p>I feel like &quot;the church&quot; is a conspiracy to keep people in line - and do what the good book tells them - while also getting their monthly tithe - a voluntary donation of 10% or more of earnings.</p>

<p>I feel like &quot;race wars&quot; is some bullshit the mainstream media is selling to convince the minorities to rise up and fight &quot;the man&quot;</p>
