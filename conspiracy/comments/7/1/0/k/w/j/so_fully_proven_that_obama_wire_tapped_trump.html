The first wiretapping FICA warrant was in 2014 and ended somewhere in 2016 and was not renewed due to his campaign involvement. August 2016, after he left the campaign the second FICA was issued. If anyone knows when the first ended it would be appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>seriously doubt obama knew a damn thing about it until after it broke, it was a small operation inside the ATF, holder should have know but again ATF keeps to themselves and might have purposefully kept it hidden or just didn&#39;t bother telling him to make someone look bad, or could have been some shady dealings with ATF and cartels or gun stores themselves to run guns.  it was later found that a handful of gun stores in AZ and NM close to the border were dealing large shipments to straw purchasers running south of the border with zero oversite as to why these people were making multiple large purchases on a regular basis, why wasn&#39;t the ATF on these guys at all?. none of this was investigated properly IMO. </p>

<p>Do you feel that it is normal? Do you believe that a Senator (who&#39;s a foreign lobbyist) on a lesser committee in the Senate would hold as much power/sway with the President as his NSA Chief or Campaign Manager? Or, does it not matter and all positions are considered the same in your eyes regardless of their stature within the Government? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why can&#39;t we choose all of them? I think most of the people in the media are really just brainwashed/so deep in an echo bubble they genuinely believe most of the stuff they&#39;re saying, they just don&#39;t think to question the people who give them informationa and &#39;official&#39; statements, because they think they&#39;re their peers. So while the media being so appalling is a big threat, I do think there&#39;s hope that if enough journalists get burst out of that bubble and realise what&#39;s really going on, then they could help change things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are just as reactionary as OP.</p>

<p>Dude is just riled up because his countrymen and fellow human beings are being sold out.</p>

<p>What kind of logic is it to completely whitewash an argument without discussing it&#39;s merits?</p>

<p>Fact is we are being sold out by the people mentioned above.</p>

<p>The Russia narrative is bullshit and I watched it develop in tandem with some fuckery that took place with wikileaks.</p>

<p>It became the new focal point of the country just like 9-11 did.</p>

<p>Seemingly in order to drum up fear in the public and give big daddy gubbernment the breathing room they need.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t berate someone for being reactionary out of fear and then jump to another reactionary scenario of your own that is also based in fear.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t exactly highlight your deductive reasoning abilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does Christopher Walken&#39;s improper speech pattern perturb you as well?</p>

<p>Why do you see the need to attempt to police others who do not conform to your personal standards?</p>

<p>At best it makes you an egotistical authoritarian who is ignorant and/or scared of the way others are free to and often prefer operate.</p>

<p>At worst it paints you as a manipulator and someone who attempts to hide knowledge with logical fallacies and character attacks.</p>

<p>WEAK ONES.</p>

<p>Like so weak it&#39;s worse than the attempt by the guy I was initially responding too.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Manafort investigation has been ongoing for over a year and tied to the podesta group in nearly every article <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/paul-manafort-donald-trump-ukraine/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/paul-manafort-donald-trump-ukraine/index.html</a></p>

<p>Was was the podesta group <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/08/27/podesta-group-subpoenaed-in-russia-probe/">subpoenaed</a> if they have nothing to do with Manafort as you claim?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The unnamed executive told NBC News that six firms participated in the campaign that Manafort coordinated, which was paid for by the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, a non-profit based in Brussels.</p>

<p>Manafort coordinated the campaign that they were involved in and you think they &quot;weren&#39;t working together&quot; are you gaslighting?</p>

<p>This is like saying Obama and Trump worked together because they both worked for the same institution at different times - Podesta worked for the biggest lobbying firm in the US, so did Manafort - that doesn&#39;t make them partners or even close to it. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say they have nothing to do with, I said they didn&#39;t work together and that&#39;s Tony Podesta, not John Podesta who was Hillary&#39;s campaign chair</p>

<p>The only one gaslighting is you - working with a very well known organization over different period means they both worked with each other? Who believes this crap?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The undisclosed lobbying he is involved in is literally the same lobbying contract that the podesta group was working on for him.</p>

<p>AGAIN that&#39;s TONY Podesta&#39;s firm, not HRC&#39;s campaign manager</p>

<p>Yes, TONY Podesta&#39;s firm, John Podesta worked for the firm in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s - connecting him to Manafort is nonsense. And Tony Podesta working with Manafort is relevant how?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Manafort was fired as campaign manager as soon as Trump found out. Why not look at both of their associations?</p>

<p>What association did John Podesta have other than being part of the firm in the 90s? And it wasn&#39;t just Manafort - Flynn, Page, Trump Jr, Trump hiding his tax returns and his business ties to Russia are all red flags.</p>

<p>Where is the lie? They didn&#39;t disclose the source - just like Trump doesn&#39;t disclose his taxes to hide the Russian money.

<p>This is true, but Manafort was hardly the only person wiretapped last fall. Rand Paul said he also had information that he was tapped as well.</p>

<p>I agree with that, but that doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t overstep the bounds of the wiretap on purpose and use it to unmask people on the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t say it was illegal in the original tweet. He asked if it was legal.</p>

<p>&quot;There is no evidence to support President Donald Trump&#39;s claim that President Barack Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department said in a new court filing.&quot;</p>

<p>Alos, megasuperkoreaLUL for using Politico as a source - you might as well have cited some guy from Hawai&#39;i who sold pot in gay bathhouses before becoming senator from a random state.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious you didn&#39;t try to research this topic because it&#39;s many sources that have reported on it, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/02/doj-no-evidence-trump-tower-was-wiretapped.html">including Fox News, which had a headline that said, &quot;DOJ: No evidence Trump Tower was wiretapped&quot;</a></p>

<p>How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!</p>

<p>I guess you could do some mental gymnastics and say &quot;my wires&quot; involves the literal wires going to every private citizen in his building. However, he then said &quot;my phones&quot;. He <em>certainly</em> doesn&#39;t own all the phones of his renters. </p>

<p>You and I both know he meant Obama was spying on <em>him personally</em>. Not someone who happened to live at Trump Tower. Regardless, this is all moot since Trump already blew his load by claiming he was referring to the unmasking; not a literal wiretap.</p>

And just because I know what is coming, closing a previous investigation doesn&#39;t mean that someone isn&#39;t a criminal or won&#39;t be. The Pulse Nightclub shooter was investigated by the FBI on suspicions of being radicalized. They found nothing at the time and closed the investigation.</p>

The difference is that they might find suspicious communications and suspicious activity that raises red flags, but important information is missing and they can&#39;t prove a link, if that information was relayed in person, for instance. The red flags didn&#39;t prove anything illegal and so they would have to close the investigation without charges being filed, while suspecting there is more.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Per my understanding, Rinat Akhmetshin is well-established to have been a member of Soviet intelligence and is believed to have worked for Russian intelligence after the fall. US intelligence is pretty adamant that he is involved with Russian intelligence. As for Fusion GPS, everything I&#39;ve read is that the dossier was the result of Republican opposition work during the primaries. Nor is it unusual for someone to work in different industries. Nor was he paid to associate with Trump. Nothing I&#39;ve seen indicates that he worked on the dossier and the dossier didn&#39;t involve associating with Trump at all, but collecting information from disparate parties.</p>

<p>Fusion GPS, headed by a former Wall Street Journal journalist known for his dogged reporting, Glenn Simpson, most often works for business clients. But in presidential elections, the firm is sometimes hired by candidates, party organizations or donors to do political “oppo” work — shorthand for opposition research — on the side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is routine work and ordinarily involves creating a big, searchable database of public information: past news reports, documents from lawsuits and other relevant data. For months, Fusion GPS gathered the documents and put together the files from Mr. Trump’s past in business and entertainment, a rich target.</p>

<p>After Mr. Trump emerged as the presumptive nominee in the spring, the Republican interest in financing the effort ended. But Democratic supporters of Hillary Clinton were very interested, and Fusion GPS kept doing the same deep dives, but on behalf of new clients.</p>

<p>They didnt deny it. FISA warrants arent something we regularly tell the public about. Should we give out secrets and classified intel instantly or do an investigation and report on it so we can disclose the right information tot he public? Thats whats going on now. Susan Rice told congress about the FISA warrants with flynn. These are just now coming out about manafort. Idiots think that because there is not instant disclosure of every fact the second they want it, there is some cover up. Chill out homes. Republican congress will cause a stink about any perceive impropriety, so you get you visiblity. </p>

<p>So in the interview you can hear clapper say to his knowledge and that he has no idea of the other agencies. Its not a denial. Its anecdotal evidence by clapper that he has not done any or seen any. Thats not the Obama administration, thats a single guy reporting from his post who didnt even oversee the matters pertaining to the counter intelligence investigation. You can misconstrue that as OBAMA himself claiming there was no illegal wiretapping all you want but that is just your feels. </p>

<p>Look at this case for instance, he was called &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;unpresidential&quot; for his original tweets all over the web and yet here you are, months later, clarifying that since the FBI wiretapped the campaign at Trump Tower, and he said Obama did that, and there&#39;s no solid link between Obama and the FBI, he&#39;s a liar.</p>

<p>The Obama administration didn&#39;t seem to lie out of habit. In comparison, Trump himself seems like a serial liar, even going out of his way to fuss over minor things, such as the inauguration crowd size.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that more lies get uncovered every week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me, this sentence really pertains to Trump more than anyone else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It also seems like Donny has an exaggerated but overall accurate version of events so far.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He has done more than exaggerated. Instead, when it comes to the whole Russia story, Trump has lied about a number of things, from his campaign meeting with the Russians, which he called &quot;fake news&quot; when it turned out to be true, and his business investments in Russia, claiming that he didn&#39;t have any at all when his lawyers said he has at least $100 million worth. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t lie that much unless you have something to hide. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>. . . here you are, months later, clarifying that since the FBI wiretapped the campaign at Trump Tower</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recent story is about Paul Manafort getting wiretapped by the FBI for his activity in the Ukraine. Now, while this may tie into the Trump scandal. it&#39;s different than Trump&#39;s broad claim that Obama was wiretapping Trump, which would be a totally different situation, especially if Obama had personally ordered the FBI to target Trump for political reasons (which doesn&#39;t seem to be the case at all).</p>

<p>So, no, nothing is being clarified here, except that Manafort is part of an ongoing federal investigation dating back to 2014.</p>

<p>Nothing about that was a lie. ObamaCare doesn&#39;t have requirements that force people to leave their doctors as the bill&#39;s opponents claimed. That being said, ObamaCare also can&#39;t control if someone&#39;s private insurance plan forces them to change doctors or to drop coverage altogether, either. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re bringing up Mitt Romney now and I don&#39;t where you&#39;re getting your quotes since you&#39;ve provided no sources and no contexts. For example, are you trying to claim that seven million Americans haven&#39;t been enrolled in Medicaid, or are you trying to say that the quoted figure is too low? And who claimed the seven million Medicaid figure in the first place?</p>

<p>You have to make an argument before randomly throwing things out.</p>

<p>IF anyone &quot;lost&quot; their doctor due to ObamaCare, and you haven&#39;t provided anything to back up your argument here, it wasn&#39;t due to ObamaCare itself forcing them to change doctors. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>if that&#39;s your definition OF A truth than trumpcare won&#39;t force anybody off healthcare either</p>

<p>Totally different situation. TrumpCare is reducing spending to programs that will directly lead to states (pertaining to Medicaid) kicking millions of people off the rolls, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-05-24/cbo-score-23-million-lose-coverage-under-american-health-care-act-deficit-trimmed-119-billion">according to the CBO and one of the TrumpCare versions</a>. There is a direct correlation here. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s get this straight: Trump said that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8mcN0zweQE">he was &quot;going to take care of everybody&quot;</a> when it came to health care, and now he has totally flip-flopped on this campaign promise -- and you&#39;re defending him for it while trying to attack Obama for a &quot;lie&quot; when you didn&#39;t even get Obama&#39;s quite right in the first place. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re still making a poor equivocation because it&#39;s about coverage, not, doctors. That&#39;s what you don&#39;t get. </p>

<p>Any cut in Medicaid, or SCHIP, or Medicare funding has direct effects. That&#39;s one of the principle issues with TrumpCare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for responding. I disagree with you on a bunch of stuff but I always appreciate a fleshed out conversation.</p>

<p>Obama administration: over the past year or so I have experienced quite the opposite. I do not trust a word from them. For me, that started back with Edward Snowden and the NSA lies but over time there have been an ASTOUNDING number of discrepancies between what they&#39;ve said and what has actually happened. Eric Holder, Benghazi, now Loretta Lynch, tons of lying going in IMO.</p>

<p>I think the &quot;more every week&quot; speaks to both of our media&#39;s biases. </p>

<p>Regarding the Russia meetings and investments, I have yet to see ANY proof that ANY of that was actually relevant past the witch hunt. To me it has seemed since the election that the CNNs and the DNC have been conflating Trump&#39;s business career with his political  career and making a fuss out of (gigantic international) business as usual. Looking for crossed i&#39;s and dotted t&#39;s.</p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t lie that much unless you have something to hide&quot; that right there is confirmation bias. Where there&#39;s smoke, there may be fire, but when all the smoke is coming from the opposition party and media, I&#39;d definitely wait to see a flame before I panic.</p>

<p>Manafort: it&#39;s amazing to me how differently both sides see this. We have the exact same facts but draw nearly opposite reactions based on the part we see as most important. You see it as more evidence of criminality in the Trump campaign and I see it as more evidence of govt abuse of power. Scott Adams writes about this, the &quot;two movies on one screen&quot; phenomenon.</p>

The FBI or whoever probably don&#39;t give a shit if the general public knows exactly who is being investigated.

<p>Why not? Is it not surprising that Trump was correct in his assessment? Is it not surprising that the head of Trump&#39;s campaign would be wiretapped? </p>

<p>Seems strange that you&#39;re trying to dictate what our expectations of government should be. Of course I don&#39;t think the FBI should come out and tell people they&#39;re being investigated, but I also think that when that shit gets found out... people are gonna be surprised.</p>

<p>It&#39;s Trump that has to keep going back and revising history. First it was &quot;wires tapped&quot;.

<p>The government was wiretapping a person who wasn&#39;t Trump. If that person calls Trump, they are still only wiretapping that person. If Trump calls someone who is wiretapped, that does not make Trump wiretapped.</p>

<p>To put this another way, let&#39;s pretend I am wiretapped. If I call you, that doesn&#39;t make you wiretapped.</p>

<p>This is such a stupid conspiracy theory. If Obama was doing unethical things to spy on Trump, why wouldn&#39;t he just spy on Trump? An unethical president doesn&#39;t even need a warrant. He just needs to instruct someone to do it off the books. The reason it came from the FISA court and has a record is because it&#39;s not what you are making it into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So at the risk of getting downvoted hard, I&#39;ll lend some potential insight as to why that happens here, at least for me. On Reddit there are strong political opinions, and I have one. There&#39;s r/politics, that is decidedly liberal and while Trump supporters can participate, they are often downvoted heavily though so their points aren&#39;t seen by the masses. Then there&#39;s the_donald, where ONLY pro Trump comments are allowed. The very first comment I made there got me perma banned many months ago. I still read it daily and get frustrated at what I see as decidedly incorrect information. The latest example is that the CNN story vindicated Trumps claim that he himself was wiretapped illegally. To me, the story does not at all vindicate Trump, and if in fact does the exact opposite. It says that Manafort, not Trump, was tapped and it says that the tapping came over a year before Manafort came on as campaign manager, removing the implication that it was politically motivated. </p>

<p>That brings us to r/conspiracy, which has a healthy mix of both left and right politics, and both sides are free to argue their points. I think a lot of people on the left see this subreddit as the only way to productively engage with supporters on the other side, and so you see what you see here. It&#39;s not shilling, it&#39;s just that by deduction this is where people go. To me, people complaining about shilling are just upset that their echo chambers aren&#39;t being applied to all of Reddit. I&#39;d say that if the community doesn&#39;t like the back and forth politics discussion then moderators would have to make policy changes to not allow it. Unfortunately for r/conspiracy, there just isn&#39;t another good place to actually engage with each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to misunderstand. The sub isn&#39;t organically &quot;not neutral&quot;, it is enforced and anything positive about Trump and negative about the opposition is removed instantly. There used to be a website late last year about the most removed and downvoted stuff on reddit, and it was clearly organized and botted to remove any negative articles about H.Clinton. Then reddit made it not work anymore, like it does to all sites showing this happening.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like going to a club where all the people are robots wearing human skinsuits. That&#39;s what politics has been like since late 2016.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>stupid lies. </p>

<p>Fisa reinstated because they met with a russian spy working to undo the magnitsky act. This would be the case if anyone met with someone who was marked as a russian spy, since they always record russian spies. Without looking at the FISA, there could be a good reason to re-open the warrant. Remember that the san bernadino shooter was wire tapped and investigated many times, each time dropped. Does not mean a crime wasnt committed or that they should never re-open investigation should the offended behavior come up again. </p>

<p>said spy(veselnitskaya) was allowed into the country without a visa by the DOJ, not obama. Its important because she was to be there as a lawyer representing a case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Veselnitskaya&#39;s application for a visa to travel to the U.S. to work on the case was denied, she said in a later court filing.</p>

<p>Instead, the Department of Justice granted Katsyv and Veselnitskaya immigration parole. In later arguments before a federal judge, a government attorney described immigration parole as &quot;a discretionary act that the statute allows the attorney general to do in extraordinary circumstances.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/did-the-obama-doj-let-russian-lawyer-natalia-veselnitskaya-into-the-u-s/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/did-the-obama-doj-let-russian-lawyer-natalia-veselnitskaya-into-the-u-s/</a></p>

<p>They just denied the visa to allow her in for these court cases only. </p>

<p>So given that, your stupid conspiracy there falls apart. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the Panama Papers, we know that the Podesta Group (founded by John Podesta’s brother, Tony) lobbied for Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank. “Sberbank is the Kremlin, they don’t do anything major without Putin’s go-ahead, and they don’t tell him ‘no’ either,” explained a retired senior U.S. intelligence official. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nowhere did I indicate that they worked with each other. By together I meant they worked at the same time for the same people. e.g. &quot;simultaneously&quot;</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Manafort investigation has been ongoing for over a year and tied to the podesta group in nearly every article <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/paul-manafort-donald-trump-ukraine/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/paul-manafort-donald-trump-ukraine/index.html</a></p>

<p>Was was the podesta group <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/08/27/podesta-group-subpoenaed-in-russia-probe/">subpoenaed</a> if they have nothing to do with Manafort as you claim?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The unnamed executive told NBC News that six firms participated in the campaign that Manafort coordinated, which was paid for by the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, a non-profit based in Brussels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Manafort coordinated the campaign that they were involved in and you think they &quot;weren&#39;t working together&quot; are you gaslighting?</p>

<p>The HRC email investigation has taken longer and has less moving parts than this investigation. FBI investigations take years. HRC email investigation was 3 years + the multiple congressional investigations.</p>

<p>People claiming that its something so simple that it wouldve been released by now are just naive. If you have the criminal case of the century, why would you rush the result? The case needs to be rock solid with lots of evidence. Evidence takes time to gather. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol funny you mention word play, because thats very important for legal matters. a words meaning has alot of significance. There is major difference between incidential collection and someone illegally wiretapping them. This is why people parse words on this subject that lead to your perceived deceit. </p>

<p>So in the interview you can hear clapper say to his knowledge and that he has no idea of the other agencies. Its not a denial. Its anecdotal evidence by clapper that he has not done any or seen any. Thats not the Obama administration, thats a single guy reporting from his post who didnt even oversee the matters pertaining to the counter intelligence investigation. You can misconstrue that as OBAMA himself claiming there was no illegal wiretapping all you want but that is just your feels. </p>
