<p>renewable energy is more than suffiecient at this point.</p>

<p>In which way are you referring to? </p>

<ul>
<li>Generation? What happens when the wind stops blow or it&#39;s night out?</li>
<li>Storage? How do you store all of the electricity that is currently on the grid for times when generation goes out?</li>
<li>Availability? What about areas that do not have a river to damn for hydro, sustainable winds for solar, or limited sun light (winter) for solar?</li>
<li>Capacity? The US currently gets <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/06/solar-wind-renewable-energy-record/">10% of it&#39;s electricity from renewable</a>, where would that other 90% come from?</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating against renewables at all, but to say it is sufficient is misleading, we need to invest a lot more into its infrastructure before it is adequate </p>

    <div class="md"><p>switch to crypto currency formed by amaerican citizens and refuse to usw thier money.  instead of everyone playing into the brainwash thoughts of &quot;its too hard&quot;, &quot;it would be too devastating&quot;, how about tou grow some balls and fight for the freedom were supposed to have.  Why is it so out there to think that citizens can take back control in a slick way just as these bankers did to us? maybe it takes a long time or a civil war syarts or whatever.  none of that is worth staying complacent and allowing things to continue.  the biggest problem we have is that everyone think someone else will take care of it but this is something that requires us all.  if your too scared then thats ok but dont tell me I have freedom in this country where the police are militarized and operate above the law, where polititions lie to get into office and then do the opposite of what they promise, where i work my ass off for taxes to take a quarter of my check while proces for everything rise.  they cut social programs and healthcare but up military spending.

<p>First watch this and realise our &quot;american&quot; dollar means nothing, less than nothing in fact its recycled debt that continues to grow.

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking of making a post like this just now but glad you made it first. I&#39;m so enraged after reading a bunch of anti-banker quotes. </p>

<p>First thing first. Fuck taxes. We should not pay a dime to this filthy country that allowed the Federal Reserve to ruin our economy. </p>

<p>2nd. We need to all stop donating to everything from the Catholic Church to the Red Cross. If we want to donate, just donate to a homeless guy. Its more likely to actually go to someone who needs it. </p>

<p>This is pitiful. Fuck all these elite bastards. </p>

We should demand a real world way of dismantling this bank system and replace it with one that is run by the people and controlled by our own govt.

    <div class="md"><p>The simplest way I found to defeat the bankers is to not use money at all. They control the flow of money so they can easily cause a drought leaving us with very little. Printing our own money is no easy task either without the resources that they control. </p>

<p>The solution. Everyone has to work a minimum of 25 hours a week at any job that is registered with a central, transparent database so that all people can see that all people are working. We not only work for free, but we consume for free. Basically, as long as one person works, they are allowed to consume. If they don&#39;t work, they don&#39;t consume. Work can be extended to raising children or taking care of old, sick folks as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just read that 45% of all work related activities can be replaced by robots as we speak. All we need to do is use robots to do most of the work. I am also considering all the hidden technology they are holding from us which can replace most all jobs. </p>

<p>I like to think of it like a family. A family doesn&#39;t count every penny and every little bit of activity they perform. They perform out of love for the good of the household. We need to do that across America where we work so that others can eat, drink, and be merry. If we all take care of each other, what&#39;s the point of money? </p>

<p>Money is too easily manipulated by the elite as they are doing now. Ok, so let&#39;s assume we stop all the corruption tomorrow. The elite will just find another way to re-accumilate all of our wealth like they always have throughout history. When Alexander the Great took over the world, he tapped hoarded wealth and gave it to the world. The entire world economy blew up for 50 years but then the elite, after Alexanders death, began hoarding it back in again and the world fell back into a prison planet. Money is the root of all evil. It is causes WAY more problems than it solves. </p>

We need real change and we need to organize and centralize our efforts.  if we just sit around talking nothing will be done.  the govt has power because they have a system in place, i say we build one that takes advantage of the current one and will replace it in time, just like they did to us!</p>

And if we try to get new politicians, the fed, and the banking mafias who back it, will shoo in their own politicians again.  If you&#39;re gonna tear it down, it all has to go, at once.</p>

<p>But even if that happened, we&#39;d have to be prepared for widespread famine and war.  If you think that the economic powerhouses would just roll over and die without a fight, you&#39;d be mistaken.

<p>It&#39;s gotta be done locally, starting from a personal level, to neighborhoods, to cities, then counties.  The more dependent we are on imports, federal funding, or the financial system, the more control they have over us.  If a city (or family) can&#39;t sustain itself for a year or two, it doesn&#39;t stand a chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Civil war at this point is the only way it will happen.  To be clear, this civil war would be nothing like Civil War I. We would essentially be fighting troops from all over the world on our soil as the global elitists are not going to lose their Sparta (natural resource rich military state).  If we were to win this &quot;Civil War II&quot;once our government and money supply was created and managed for the benefit of the people (assuming we are not fooled again by some agent of the oligarch), we would then have to fight World War III.  The global elites are not going to allow a country as wealthy as ours to leave the fold. If you were living in Europe/Asia/etc, prior to the attack on the US 2.0, you would be inundated with propaganda about how we are evil and vile.  The UN needs to control our WMD, the UN needs to liberate the Christians/Muslim/Jews/Native Americans/Blacks/Whites/Hispanics/insert any other potential peoples here. We would be attacked as we have done to countless countries under the guise of liberation, democracy, freedom, or to protect the world from terrorism. Terrorists is what we would have become. Terrorists is what we would be to the oligarch, and therefore the rest of the world. After we are defeated, a new friendly administration would be supplanted to ensure all is right with the world.  So, that&#39;s how I see it beginning and ending. Not being defeatist, just realistic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The federal reserve gets a lot of flack for what is a simpler problem: fractional reserve banking. </p>

<p>Did I say simple? That&#39;s probably not even accurate. Fractional reserve banking has at least somewhat noble roots. It allows people to own property and expensive assets who otherwise would have no chance. Do you think anyone would lend you $300,000 with the promise to pay it back in 30 years using your $50,000 wage slave job if they actually had to lend you money that exists? </p>

<p>So we have the benefit of cheap credit, and a really really bad design for it. Private banks control over 90% of the money supply and hold the entire economy in the palm of their hand. This is the essence of &quot;too big to fail&quot;.</p>

<p>Ironically, the solution is probably to keep the federal reserve, but transfer ownership to the public domain. Fed profits should add to the federal treasury. This is what Canada does. But more needs to be done than this. Banks should only be able to lend money they have, or act as a broker for &quot;new money&quot; loans directly from the government, who should have the sole power to approve and issue them. </p>

<p>There&#39;s even more benefit to this system too. It gives the government the long desired fine-tuning control over the economy that they need. There&#39;s a housing bubble but small business is suffering? Currently their only tool is to manipulate prime rates, but if they controlled all new money loans they could slow down the housing bubble and stimulate with business loans at the same time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>either way it shouldnt be a private corp.  If the Federal reserve was actually part of the Federal govt then that is exactly what id want.  I think even this is silly though.  In the long run were headed for futuristic society.  In my mind i envision doing away with all jobs and automate what needs to be done and creating huge housing buildings to offer free housing.  grow food hydroponicly in &quot;clean rooms&quot; using organic techniques.  all of this can be done using robots/3d printing.  due away with money and allow people to flourish in thier talemts.  If people want to work they may but it wouldnt be required.  I think a big problem is that we all think within the confines of the rules of the current system.  I think we should be thinking bigger and long term.  knock down the caste system and level the field.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why would you caution against a redesign? you do realise the world you see around you is an elaborate hoax,  that is not designed for your comfort.  By taking control and restructuring society now, a few generations from now will learn to be less self absorbed and taught to love ine another.  there are many systems in olace to limit the types of people there are in order to limit the types of control needed to keep thise people in line.  school, food, social activities, nothing has been accidental.  I think using robots and 3d printing would simplify what we have now.  sire developement will take time but doesnt that go for wverything now? we can use self healing concrete so even maintenance would be vastly diminished.

    <div class="md"><p>I like the way you think but I think moderately left libertarian center left democratic socialism
and/or social democracy and centrism would be a faster and easier solution
to the deliberately rigged economic system compared to more left anarchistic type of economics.
If in a few hundred years, elites and sociopaths have left the gene pool (perhaps due to things like improvements in research/medicine/psychology/genetics)
then so be it, we can implement that type of completely different system at that point
when we&#39;re all less ignorant and psychotic lol.</p>

<p>Right now, we just have to get money out of politics,
protect the people from psycho corporations, restrain/regulate the corps and banks, and use social programs to benefit the population and economy (withOUT corporate interference).</p>

<p>When there&#39;s enough opportunities available,
there will be far more advancements in science, tech, medicine, psychology, etc.
Real progress.
I think forcing it could be a misstep and too premature.
But I prefer your type of thinking
than that of the propaganda some people unknowningly push
like &quot;get a job you loser&quot;.
Working HARD is overrated, there needs to be a balance.
You need to enjoy what you&#39;re doing OR get compensated enough
for doing a job you&#39;d rather not do.</p>

<p>I think without a little authoritarianism,
the elites could infiltrate things (maybe why dictator socialist countries are forced
to be this careful against CIA spies and rebels and such which could take over the country and corrupt it).</p>

<p>We should start with a balanced approach
and AWAY from NEOliberal far right economics,
towards centrism and see how the economy improves, mental health,
intelligence, physical health, happiness, etc.
Then eventually center left (left of Bernie) would be optimum
for a long time.</p>

<p>At some point we could implement universal basic income
but it would have to be done by benevolant people,
because if the elites do it,
they&#39;re going to give it with one hand,
and take away social programs with the other (using UBI as an excuse &quot;you don&#39;t need free shit now you peasants&quot;
when it&#39;s really the elites who leech from US and the fruits of our labor.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an excellent text book, even college level text book response, and it is completely full of false narratives. I will concede the benefit of fractional reserve banking to the economy at large, and especially those at the helm. However, a federal reserve bank does not need to exist at all. Necessary expansion and contractions of money supply can easily be done by the governments treasury through long forgotten treasury tools, reserve requirements, overnight repo rates, and other short term and long term credit facilities. The initial pitch for the Fed was to help stem the voraciousness of boom and bust periods. Arguably these boom and bust periods, or times of creative destruction are a vital part to any healthy economy. Incidentally the worst economic depression our country has ever seen began just 16 or so odd years after the Fed was created. This resulted in the elimination of many small financial institutions and fewer larger financial institutions...as did the 2008 crisis. Currently these periods of expansion and contraction are manipulated globally by institutions that have no skin in the game and prosper in either scenario. The only thing any g-20 treasury does at this point in time, in relation to money supply, is issue debt. The US government can&#39;t even print its own dollar bills for fucks sake. To paraphrase a quote from one of the Rothschilds, &#39;allow me to control a country&#39;s money and I care not who writes the laws&#39;. </p>

<p>Currently our Federal Reserve transfers all gains to the US Treasury, the same as Canada and every other central bank on the planet that I&#39;m aware of, less &quot;administrative expenses&quot;. Coincidentally, none of these reserve banks has ever been truly audited. </p>

<p>If you desire an education on the federal reserve system free of the official narrative I encourage you to read &quot;The Creature from Jekyll Island&quot;</p>

Details the creation of the federal reserve system, fractional banking, eliminating the gold standard, and the why it exists. Excellent book. </p>

Problem is, they indoctrinate this system in high schools as &#39;normal&#39; and dont teach about the economic prosperity the country had when we weren&#39;t on a debt-based/ central banking system. Not that that time was terribly long, but the financiers were on the outside, jelly as fuck, looking in. We need another Andrew Jackson </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what we need to do is create an entirely different society withon this current one.  If there were businesses  and enough people willing we could BE the society we want.  Think about it.  Some guy went and created cryptocurrency out of thin air and it worked! so why cant we create one we all agree to use and start only using this new currency.  im not sure exactly how to type this out but i think im onto something.  why couldnt we refuse to use the &quot;american dollar&quot;? What if there were businesses who employed people and paid them with this new currency and they used the currency at other stores and businesses doing the same.  make sure there is a spread of industries from hrocery stores to dry cleaners to clothing stores, etc.  make sure peoples needs are covered and create an employee owned conglomerate of stores that all use this currency exclusively.  could this somehow be spread and catch on? im sure there is lots im missing here and i welcome criticism, that helps progress.  this is just one huys idea, im sure we can do better, we need to believe in ourselves and each other.  Do some soul searching and meditate my brothers, we can do this but it has to be together. </p>
