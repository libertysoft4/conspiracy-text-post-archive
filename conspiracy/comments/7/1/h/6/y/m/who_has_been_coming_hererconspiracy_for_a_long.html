    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, very frequent visitor for 6/7 years here.</p>

<p>It used to not have a lot of traffic. I would read the stuff on the front page on my morning commute from the day before and there would be no need to check it again until the next day. There was no fear of missing something.</p>

<p>The threads did have some political things, no doubt. But the ratio was nowhere near as skewed as it is now. There was a lot of fringe stuff. Ancient civilisations, crop circles, aliens, numerology predictions, etc.</p>

<p>I miss it a bit. I can still get my &quot;fix&quot; for the above topics from more specific subreddits, but they don&#39;t have the same kind of traffic they had on here as the subscriber count is far lower on them.</p>

Lately we have been swinging back to normal, but there are always outliers.  It was far more center ib terms of political thinking, but now leans right, with fairly frequent shilling for the left at certain hours of the day.  Weekends during the evening (US time) are where this place is almost at its purest.  </p>

<p>r/conspiracy used to have few enough posts that from day to day, it didn&#39;t change too much. Then IamJulianAssange came and started posting enough that every day, there was a new front page, which inspired others to post as well. This went on for about a year or so. I think he even got admin banned and had to change his name slightly. Then, once the subreddit had enough followers to stand on its own, he left. </p>

<p>He never posted anything to indicate he was actually Julian Assange, but you never know, he may have been hiding in plain sight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I joined Reddit in like 2015. Maybe 2014? Didn&#39;t post much. I think I only even registered to post something about Super Smash Bros. </p>

<p>Then I got interested in the Sanders campaign shortly before the primaries really got going and was excited to see someone I agreed with so much getting traction. I&#39;ve never been a R or a D, and I&#39;ve always had a deep hate for the broken two party system, so it was really refreshing to know that he&#39;s been successful as an independent in Congress for decades. I started hanging out in various political subreddits because of that, but most political subreddits are controlled by asshole authoritarians who ban folks who go against the manufactured circle jerk. Before the primaries ended last year, I had been banned from multiple subs for talking about the fraud that was being committed against the Sanders campaign. The liar who banned me from r/politics claimed it was because &quot;violence/death&quot;, which is absurd since I&#39;m an extreme pacifist. They ignored me when I questioned it. These days, I think I&#39;m up to at least 13 different sub bans despite me never breaking rules to deserve it. I&#39;ve been coming here pretty regularly since last summer, and other than this sub, the only one I can recommend that won&#39;t ban you to silence your political dissent is r/wayofthebern. Even fucking r/sandersforpresident banned me when I kept linking to credible news reports about all the election fraud that was going on.</p>

<p>But yeah, I&#39;m basically just here because most everywhere else banned me for hating Clinton and I&#39;ve only been here a little over a year. I&#39;ve definitely noticed more than a few regulars, but this sub is large enough that it&#39;s kind of hard. If you use the Reddit enhancement suite or some other add-on, that might make it easier for you to recognize folks. I know I started recognizing people more when it showed me I had upvoted certain users dozens and dozens of times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same deal here more or less.  Had seen reddit a few years back and didn&#39;t really get why people would use it, then yeah, right before the primaries got going I got pulled into reading the updates of the fraud and all the bullshit going on daily, then the Podesta emails/pizzagate.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s crazy in as little time as I&#39;ve been reading here how nuts its gotten with all the fake accounts/bots/whatever, I can&#39;t imagine how obnoxious this shit is for people that have been here much longer than that.</p>

<p>Things got warped and stupid when the operatives from the US two party monopoly started turning the place acrimonious.</p>

<p>The place has been the object of mounting scorn, derision and malicious attack.</p>

<p>The subs dedicated to attacking this place are a testament to the fact that free thinking is despised by the champions of the status quo.</p>
