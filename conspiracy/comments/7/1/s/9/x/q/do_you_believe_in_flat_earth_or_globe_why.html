<p>I notice flat earth believers are 100% certain we are living under a dome surrounded by wall of ice, yet they cannot produce unquestionable proof. Why is there only 1 flat earth model? How can you believe in a map that cannot and has never been utilized as a source for navigation? How can we be under a dome-like structure, if there exists a south pole star? What do you rely on for confirmation, if you are one who buys into the mainstream flat earth model?</p>

<p>Similarly, believers of heliocentrism are 100% certain we are living on a ball with curving oceans rotating 1000mph on a tilted axis while flying around the sun at insane speeds, while at the same time flying with the sun around the center of the galaxy at even more insane speeds...but, again, based on what evidence? central bank owned government funded education/indoctrination? Theory of Gravity? Big Bang? That&#39;s what we&#39;ve been told since 500 years ago? Everyone knows it to be true? Where do you find confirmation for this &#39;globe&#39;? How can you get over the absurdity of curving bodies of water? How can you discount the very real experiments, measurements, and photos taken, which disprove curvature? How can you buy into the globe theory, when you know full well that your governments and their $cientists have lied and continue to lie for profit/job security? Do you trust NASA, JAXA, or any other central-bank owned government space agency? What do you rely on for confirmation, if you are one who buys into the mainstream heliocentric model?</p>

<p>Question: what map projection do we use for accurate land measurements/navigation? </p>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-1" data-depth="1" data-id="dnd2so5">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ZiggyAdventures.html">ZiggyAdventures</a> 2017-09-22</p>
    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually the other way around, gravity could leak to those other dimensions. There are two main methods of gravity that current theory support.</p>

<p>The most publicly known one is the Higgs mechanism. It was predicted as the method to break electroweak symmetry. Back in a hotter universe the weak force(Z, W+, W- bosoms) acted identical to photons. It made no sense for them to act different in the standard model. The Higgs Field was a theory that broke the symmetry, however it also predicted a Higgs Boson. The discover of tr Higgs Bosom was a large indicator the Higgs is real.</p>

<p>The Higgs field is a imaginary mass field with non zero potential at 0 energy. When the universe cooled the 3 weak forces acquired mass by dragging on the Higgs Field through the Higgs mechanism. This caused the weak forces to be massive, short ranged, and more powerful.</p>

<p>The Higgs field also gives mass to other particles, however only a fraction unlike all the mass for the weak field. It&#39;s possible for more Higgs type fields to exist.</p>

<p>Meanwhile many other particles are theorized to get thier mass from Quark-Gluon Yukawa interactions. In simple terms the quarks interacting with each other through force particles drag on each other.</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically, the electroweak synertry breaking was a huge panic event for the standard model. Without the Higgs field the standard model predicts the weak force to act identical to photons of the electromagnetic force. Basically they should not have mass. It took many years(I can&#39;t remember how long) before the Hiss Field was theorized to account for this. It fit like a glove, but if no Higgs Bosom was found it would signal a massive flaw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither. The shape of the Earth and its nature would be very enlightening thing to know, to know such a thing resides out of reach for most.</p>

<p>Officially the Earth is flat, in geodetic frames, and curved (spherical) in macroscopic frames. (Plane surveying)</p>

<p>Someone should perform the <a href="http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s8-06/8-06.htm">Gauss Mountain experiment</a> as it&#39;s as close to a direct measurement as possible. &quot;Scientists&quot;, instead of performing the experiment, have resorted instead to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/229274">&quot;debunking&quot; the myth</a>, which passes for <em>science</em> in this day an age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another one is the rectilinear experiment. It was done by what people regard today as a Christian cult - Koreshians. </p>

<p>It&#39;s never been redone, so again, it begs the question &#39;why not&#39;. They claim their results showed the Earth is indeed curved, but, as a concave sphere not a convex one. </p>

<p>The test that was done reportedly had members of a scientific organization present and they confirmed tests perimeters and results. Though it still gets a &quot;debunking&quot; in academia with very weak arguments which cherry pick the observations and make claims against it.</p>

<p>Even if the Earth is a sphere (convex), if there were an experiment that showed or implied otherwise it has scientific value [a paradox]. No different than QM physicists who measure in particles and waves. </p>
