    <div class="md"><p>I know weather manipulation exsists, cloud seeding has been a known thing for some time.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m having a hard time believing is that the technology exsists to manipulate hurricanes. Just because a patent exsists does not mean the technology is available to use, you could go get a patent for a time machine...that doesn&#39;t mean you have a working time machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To &quot;manipulate&quot; a hurricane, you just have to steer it in the direction you want it to go. HOW do you do that? Create areas of high and low pressure AROUND the hurricane and it will naturally head in the only direction that it can. For example, take a look at this weather chart during Hurricane Irma: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/iFwtzfP.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/iFwtzfP.jpg</a></p>

<p>IF there is a high pressure zone sitting above where the hurrican is located, it can&#39;t move. It just sits in one place and spins. As soon as you move that high pressure zone, it continues its natural course. Creating these high and low pressure zones is relatively easy with HAARP-like technology and cloud seeding with aluminum particles being sprayed into the atmosphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Creating strings of &#39;natural&#39; disasters takes it&#39;s toll on the people and the economy. It also pushes globalist agendas like: funding for FEMA, UN involvement, dependence on central government, debt, depopulation, etc. It also serves to &#39;weaken&#39; a base. Texas is usually thought of a self-governing, free wheeling, bastion of freedom and individual liberty. But, when people are busy rebuilding their lives, they don&#39;t have time for activism or national-level political involvements. It helps to destroy nationalism and steers us towards globalism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually pretty simple. Warmer than usual waters, good humidity, and low wind shear. That&#39;s pretty much all you need to make powerful hurricanes. Meanwhile the Atlantic subtropical high is the main guiding force, as you can see by Irma following its edge and turning North after reaching the southwestern point. A mid latitude trough pulled in right after Irma driving back the subtropical high. This is why Jose and subsequent hurricanes are turning North sooner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think HAARP is responsible for these, do some quick math.</p>

<p>A rough estimation for an average Category 3 Hurricane consists of 6.0 x 10<sup>14</sup> Watts of energy. That&#39;s 600,000 Gigawatts of energy. </p>

<p>HAARP operates with 5 2500 kilowatt generators. That&#39;s 0.0125 Gigawatts.</p>

<p>0.0125 Gigawatts into 600,000 isn&#39;t going to change a thing.</p>

<p>There is little chance that HAARP has enough energy to do anything to a hurricane, let alone grow it to Category 5 from 1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Creating strings of &#39;natural&#39; disasters takes it&#39;s toll on the people and the economy. It also pushes globalist agendas like: funding for FEMA, UN involvement, dependence on central government, debt, depopulation, etc. It also serves to &#39;weaken&#39; a base. Texas is usually thought of a self-governing, free wheeling, bastion of freedom and individual liberty. But, when people are busy rebuilding their lives, they don&#39;t have time for activism or national-level political involvements. It helps to destroy nationalism and steers us towards globalism. </p>
