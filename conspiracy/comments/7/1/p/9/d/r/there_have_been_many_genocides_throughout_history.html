    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_Holocaust">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_Holocaust</a></p>

<p>&quot;The word &quot;holocaust&quot; originally derived from the Greek word holokauston, meaning &quot;a completely (holos) burnt (kaustos) sacrificial offering,&quot; or &quot;a burnt sacrifice offered to a god.&quot; In Greek and Roman pagan rites, gods of the earth and underworld received dark animals, which were offered by night and burnt in full. The word &quot;holocaust&quot; was later adopted in Greek translations of the Torah to refer to the olah,[3] standard communal and individual sacrificial burnt offerings that Jews were required[4] to make in the times of the Beit HaMikdash (Temple in Jerusalem). In its Latin form, holocaustum, the term was first used with specific reference to a massacre of Jewish people by the chroniclers Roger of Howden[5] and Richard of Devizes in England in the 1190s.[6]</p>

<p>The earliest use of the word holocaust to denote a massacre recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary dates from 1833 when the journalist Leitch Ritchie, describing the wars of the medieval French monarch Louis VII, wrote that he &quot;once made a holocaust of thirteen hundred persons in a church&quot;, a massacre by fire of the inhabitants of Vitry-le-François in 1142. As this occurred in a church, it could be seen as a religious offering. The English poet John Milton had used the word to denote a conflagration in his 1671 poem Samson Agonistes, in which the massacre was clearly divinely dedicated.[7] The word gradually developed to mean a massacre thereon, taking on a secular connotation.[8][9]&quot;</p>

<p>Followed by discussion about the word genocide being coined then (true, coined in 1944).</p>

<p>Then along comes you, too much of a dipshit to read and understand spouting off about something unrelated and so intent on winning an argument that you don&#39;t seem to notice you invented it yourself.</p>

<p>That said, the world should absolutely do what it can to stop the genocides in the Sudan, Myanmar, and anywhere else. It&#39;d also be great if the media cared about more than what concerns the West directly.</p>

<p>The German Holocaust is particularly disgusting once you realise they are paying millions in reperations to the Zionist Jews who tortued and bruttaly killed so many of their people &quot;Gas Chambers&quot; and &quot;Ovens&quot; arenothing compared to the brutality of the Zionist Jews. </p>

<p>Did you know that outside the West, the majority of people don&#39;t believe in the holocaust? Because they haven&#39;t been indoctrinated and emotionally manipulated since childhood to believe it. It&#39;s easier for them to look at it objectively and see that it stinks to high heaven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s a guilt thing. Israel feeds off it. </p>

<p>Israel has spent its ENTIRE life, even back into the Bible, being entitled little shits. Just going wherever they want, killing and raping under the command of their god. With no feelings of guilt because &#39;we are the chosen ones!&#39; 
&#39;Poor pitiful&#39; Israel has its fingers in so many religions. While some factions of Christians hate them for the death of Jesus, many consider Israelites holy and chosen. My own parents send money to charity&#39;s who&#39;s purpose is to fly Jewish people back to Israel and help reclaim Palestine. They couldn&#39;t afford Christmas for their children but they could send hundreds of dollars to fund the genocide of Palestinian children. These same Scotch-Irish parents insist on wearing stars of David and have Hebrew religious items all over the house even though they are Christian. 
These are the people who are pushing for MORE aid to be sent to Israel. Who want a war. 
And the whole world just bends over backwards for them because &#39;oh well remember the Holocaust?&#39; Guess what?! They weren&#39;t the only ones dying in the chambers. In fact, WE LEFT GAY MEN IN THE CAMPS TO DIE WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER. But do we act like we owe them crap? No in fact they just got rights a couple years ago. 
There is also evidence to suggest that the death toll may have been greatly exaggerated. For there to have been that many deaths, EVERY Jewish woman in Germany alone would have had to have at LEAST 6 children each. 
Then we have the Rothchilds. A Jewish &#39;family&#39; that controls the worlds money, the same world that is constantly giving Israel a pass. 
If you really step back you begin to see Israel as the manipulative liar. They want to cry and guilt trip everyone. But the moment we aren&#39;t looking they are killing small children and trying to start a Holy War. </p>

<p>I have a point here. My point is shit happens ok. Bad shit happens to country&#39;s and people are assholes. So what gives Israel this pass they seem to have? 
They didn&#39;t invent genocide. They just gave it a new name. 
I&#39;m not anti Semitic, I just feel that they shouldn&#39;t be able to walk all over everyone and then play the victim any time someone tells them to stop. </p>

<p>For more than 20 years, Robert Faurisson has been Europe&#39;s foremost Holocaust revisionist scholar.</p>

<p>For his views Faurisson has repeatedly been a victim of physical assault.
Between November 1978 and May 1993 he was a victim of ten attacks, 
at least nine of them carried out by Jewish thugs. 
None of the criminal assailants in any of these assaults has ever 
been brought to justice. 
The most savage was a nearly fatal attack on September 16, 1989, 
for which a group calling itself &quot;The Sons of the Memory of the Jews&quot;
claimed responsibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is from an American perspective; In my opinion I think that history taught to students in the US tends to be very US-centric, specifically focusing on how certain events changed or benefited the US, rather than how they changed or benefited the world. I think that because the US had a part in the liberation of concentration camps, it&#39;s considered something to be proud of. Because we never &quot;saved&quot; anyone from the Khmer Rouge or directly aided any Tutsi during the Rwandan Genocide, people don&#39;t view it as essential to high school US history. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just my opinion though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It was considered part of the driving motivation to fight the Nazis in World War II, and school history curriculums (at least American ones) love covering wars, especially WWII, because of how widespread it was and less morally grey than WWI.</p></li>
<li><p>The motivation behind it was ultimately to eliminate a race of people (as well as other &quot;undesirables&quot;) from a continent, if not the world. Other genocides in the same era were usually of political opposition, such as Stalin&#39;s Forced Famine in the Ukraine when it was still part of the Soviet Union, as well as the Cambodian genocide.</p></li>
<li><p>The organization behind it has gained notoriety for rounding up people to send them to death camps rather than just killing them wherever they were found. </p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s the most recent attempt at eliminating a group of people for their race/ethnicity, rather than political opposition, with such a high estimated death count. The earliest year it&#39;s estimated to have started isn&#39;t even 100 years ago, so it still has a historical significance reaching to the present.</p></li>
<li><p>It was part of the Nazis&#39; invasion of multiple countries, and invading countries and killing their people gains more historical notoriety than killing people within the country they already rule.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s not the only genocide to get taught in schools. Things like Stalin&#39;s killing of his own people, the Cambodian Genocide, Apartheid, and the slaughter of Native Americans are usually taught as well.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know what this post is implying, that the only reason the Holocaust gets covered so much is because they want us to believe it&#39;s real when it really isn&#39;t. Or that the Jews want to play the victim card to excuse their attempted takeover of the world (which is incredibly ironic). But there are actually several reasons why it has enough historical significance to be covered in nearly every history class. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Holocaust_denial">And there is more proof of its existence rather than the contrary</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Canadian here.  Only taught about the Holocaust.  Officially.  I mean the teacher talked that it was a genocide, that it wasn&#39;t the first, wont be the last.</p>

<p>As to why, as a North American, it&#39;s the big one.  Because it happened when the whole world was fighting Nazis.  And I imagine a liberal american educator would love to extole the virtues of fighting evil and doing good.  Stopping industrialized killing of people has to be a good thing.  And, as I remember it in my Canadian education, the Holocaust was&#39;t just Jews.  Gypsy&#39;s, homesexuals, lefties.  If we didn&#39;t stop it, it wouldn&#39;t have stopped with them.  Slavs would have come next.  Then who?  </p>

<p>I suspect we don&#39;t teach about the atrocities our ancestors committed because saying we don&#39;t want to admit we can place such low value on life.  I know we european settlers obliterated whole peoples and cultures.  Hard to think of yourself as a good Canadian, and Canada as a good place if you really have to face what evil it took to create it.  To create you.  </p>

<p>&quot;The word &quot;holocaust&quot; originally derived from the Greek word holokauston, meaning &quot;a completely (holos) burnt (kaustos) sacrificial offering,&quot; or &quot;a burnt sacrifice offered to a god.&quot; In Greek and Roman pagan rites, gods of the earth and underworld received dark animals, which were offered by night and burnt in full. The word &quot;holocaust&quot; was later adopted in Greek translations of the Torah to refer to the olah,[3] standard communal and individual sacrificial burnt offerings that Jews were required[4] to make in the times of the Beit HaMikdash (Temple in Jerusalem). In its Latin form, holocaustum, the term was first used with specific reference to a massacre of Jewish people by the chroniclers Roger of Howden[5] and Richard of Devizes in England in the 1190s.[6]</p>

<p>The earliest use of the word holocaust to denote a massacre recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary dates from 1833 when the journalist Leitch Ritchie, describing the wars of the medieval French monarch Louis VII, wrote that he &quot;once made a holocaust of thirteen hundred persons in a church&quot;, a massacre by fire of the inhabitants of Vitry-le-François in 1142. As this occurred in a church, it could be seen as a religious offering. The English poet John Milton had used the word to denote a conflagration in his 1671 poem Samson Agonistes, in which the massacre was clearly divinely dedicated.[7] The word gradually developed to mean a massacre thereon, taking on a secular connotation.[8][9]&quot;</p>
