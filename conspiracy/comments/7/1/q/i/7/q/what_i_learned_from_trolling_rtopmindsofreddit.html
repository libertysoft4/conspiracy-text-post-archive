        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This headline (and submission*) is a parody of a current top r/TopMindsOfReddit submission. I would never &quot;troll&quot; a subreddit for 3 years because I am not a complete and utter failure of a human being.</p>

<p>But I&#39;d like to discuss what I learned about the TopMindsOfReddit community and it&#39;s users. I&#39;ll break it down into separate categories for a more entertaining and educational read. Open <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/71m81c/what_i_learned_from_trolling_rconspiracy_for_3/">this post</a> in a separate window to really enjoy the little details.</p>

<p><strong>Critical Thinking is for Dummies.</strong></p>

<p>There have been many, many absurd posts mocking critical thinking over the past years so I&#39;m just going to bullet point some major conspiracies and the reaction of the TopMindsOfReddit:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>9/11 - TopMinds have see no issue with a group of barely trained Middle Eastern men managing to highjack two planes, with box cutters, with such pinpoint precision that three NYC buildings then conveniently collapsed into their own footprints. These terrorist also managed to &quot;fly a plane&quot;, inches above the ground, directly into the Pentagon, one of the most secure and monitored area of the entire country, but no footage of that plane even entering DC airspace exists. </p></li>
<li><p>Elite Pedophile Rings - TopMinds thinks that the idea of royalty and those in power having sex slaves is absurd. Those who have documented the history of civilization know otherwise. But TopMinds knows that it totally doesn&#39;t happen anymore because those in power pinky-sweared that they stopped.</p></li>
<li><p>Science vs. $cience - TopMinds clearly doesn&#39;t understand that one of the main pillars of the scientific method is to undergo criticism and scrutiny. Which is why TopMinds also doesn&#39;t understand the difference between real science and $cience. </p></li>
<li><p>Information Manipulation - TopMinds don&#39;t understand basic concepts like advertising, PR, and propaganda because most of them are very young and have no experience as working adults.</p></li>
<li><p>Vaccines - TopMinds believes that r/conspiracy believes, and I quote: &quot;diseases aren&#39;t really a thing&quot;. These are the kinds of hyperbolic conclusions that they must cling to in order to feel superior.</p></li>
<li><p>NASA - TopMinds knows that everything NASA says is true because government agencies never lie. Anyone who questions any aspect of anything NASA presents clearly believes &quot;the world in flat&quot; and &quot;Earth is run by lizards&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Flat-earth - TopMinds believes that every single person in r/conspiracy literally thinks the Earth is flat because a handful of people post about it (many are likely trolls from their own sub).</p></li>
<li><p>Seth Rich - TopMinds believes that only one of two options is possible: 1) Hillary Clinton literally murdered Seth Rich with her bare hands; or 2) Hillary was at her local shelter washing the feet of the poor</p></li>
<li><p>Donald Trump - Sorting by top &quot;all time&quot; you can easily see that TopMinds are absolutely obsessed with Donald Trump. Like the once fashionable &quot;enoughTrumpspam&quot; subreddit, TopMinds obsess over him so much that they actually become the very thing that they are mocking.</p></li>
<li><p>Mainstream Media - the gospel of truth for a TopMinds user</p></li>
<li><p>False Flags - Another things proven many times over by documented history, but TopMinds believe that people in power are totally past that kind of behavior and anyone who questions anything that ever happens deserves to be shamed for it. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The &quot;TopMinds&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The real meat and potatoes of the subreddit. The things that sticks out for me the most is the dangerous level of superiority, and I do not say this in a mocking or insulting way. The sheer volume of users that have clear and obvious signs of a superiority complex is absolutely striking. While the desperate need to feel superior is the classic trademark of the TopMinds community, it goes above and beyond in too many people.</p>

<p>The Dunning–Kruger effect. Is r/TopMindsofReddit made up of people suffering from this? The answer is undeniably yes. &quot;The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein persons of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is.&quot; </p>

<p>They&#39;re just smarter than everyone else, that&#39;s why they&#39;re so enlightened that they needed to create their own personal safe-space echo-chamber to seek validation from one another. They desperately seek acceptance from one another and it is truly interesting to watch a lone member fall into confusion when he or she accidentally steps out of whatever circlejerk the majority has decided is &quot;true&quot;. They truly believe that they are enlightened enough to completely have a grip on everything about every aspect of reality and the idea of deeper meaning scares them, probably because of the difficulty presented by getting their echo-chamber to accept it. They have it all figured it out.</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that reddit is full of very young and very impressionable minds. A subreddit like TopMinds or Conspiratard is going to seem very attractive to that teenager who &quot;has it all figured out&quot; or that dead-beat adult who peaked in high school and still desperately clings to those power dynamics. When you add the very obvious signs of inflated ego and the Dunning–Kruger effect than the result is a subreddit like TopMindsofReddit. </p>

<p>The irony is that they are even projecting the term &quot;Top Minds&quot; based on their own inferiority complex. Because by ironically calling the conspiracy community the &quot;Top Minds&quot; the unspoken conclusion would be that the members of TopMindsofReddit are actually &quot;smarter&quot; and &quot;better&quot; than them. Another way to put it is that members of TopMindsofReddit feel threatened or challenged. They mock the term &quot;Top Minds&quot; on their perceived opponent because they feel that they <em>actually</em> deserve that title. But again, don&#39;t expect any of them to understand this.</p>

<p><strong>The Community Itself</strong></p>

<p>Wew boi. They are deeply challenged by the motto &quot;question everything and always seek proof&quot;, because the only way to keep their manufactured validation-chamber intact is to keep everything as simple and as mainstream as humanly possible . If you question a mainstream narrative, you are ironically called a &quot;Top Mind&quot;. To ask for further proof within a mainstream narrative is the ultimate sin in r/TopMindsofReddit, as has been demonstrated by various users. Many young, impressionable members of that sub suddenly find themselves being gang-downvoted for stepping out of line. Sadly, I doubt any of them even understand the psychology behind it. But they learn their lesson and the TopMinds circlejerk presses on.</p>

<p>Shills. TopMinds are so lacking in critical thinking and self-awareness, that they mock r/conspiracy users for being worried about shills while TopMinds have literally created an entire subreddit dedicated to brigading conspiracy threads. They make submissions like &quot;What I learned from trolling r/conspiracy for 3 years&quot; and then turn around in the same breath and call us paranoid for believing that they are trolling and harassing our threads.</p>

<p>These mental gymnastics are always a favorite part of that community. Every few hours they make a new thread which is essentially a &quot;call to action&quot; to attack a discussion that they feel threatened by. Then they will all flood over there and spread various types of hyperbole and nonsense, while all secretly having a laugh at how &quot;cool&quot; it is going to be to meet up later back at the base to give each other high-fives. </p>

<p>The irony of course is that many times they are actually seeing their own hyperbole and comments designed to be &quot;something a crazy conspiracy theorist would say&quot; and then they are actually using those comments as examples or proof of how &quot;crazy&quot; conspiracy theorist are. Completely oblivious to the fact that they themselves are the ones going over-the-top pretending to be lunatics. Again, the Dunning–Kruger effect seems to keep them oblivious to these truths. </p>

<p>For example, TopMinds see a couple random posts saying &quot;Sept 23rd is Doomsday&quot; and attribute this nonsense to an entire subreddit of a half-million people. They pat each other on the back over how all 490k+ subscribers have clearly &quot;lost it&quot; and have all quit their jobs to work full time on their underground bunkers. These are the kinds of exaggerations needed in order to feel superior and feed those immature monster egos. I used to feel sorry for them until I realized that the kinds of people who would create a subreddit just to mock and brigade a place that encourages thinking outside-of-the-box... well, I guess being that way is really a punishment in and of itself.</p>

<p><strong>r/TopMindsofReddit In 3 Points</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Superiority Complex</li>
<li>Dunning–Kruger effect</li>
<li>Projecting Insecurities</li>
</ul>

<p>R.I.P. u/Gentleman_Retard</p>

<p>edit: (they already linked to this thread <em>twice</em>, but then I think they realized how desperate it looked and shamed the second user into deleting his submission) </p>

<p>*which is why it tends to be overly hyperbolic in places</p>

Although you may be right about some of them being relatively young, leadership has been on reddit the better part of a decade.

This sub spends a lot of time complaining about brigades and has removed numerous posts due to &quot;brigading&quot; in the past.

<p>Like I said, <em>nobody</em> cares. So if you care..</p>

<p>Exactly. They link to shitposts and then cast shade on the whole sub.</p>

<p>Shitposts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&#39;t blame other people for the actions of users egged on by lunacy at the top. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I can. Nobody outsa gun to these users&#39; heads and forces them to link here and berate and ridicule our userbase.  The blame lies solely on them and their shitty attitudes and shitty parents (most likely).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re all for free speech as long as it coincides with what you believe in.   </p>

<p>Where did I say I was anti free speech?</p>

<p>You can say whatever you want. But you&#39;ll get called out whenever it&#39;s necessary. This is a tired and lazy argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Julius Caesar occupied the moon while riding a unicorn</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... nobody would feel hostility. Indifference, or slight amusement perhaps.</p>

<p>If I say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>bearded acrobatic pilots don&#39;t throw passports outside of aircraft cabins and can&#39;t pulverize 3 steel skyscrapers with 2 aluminum planes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... many people (although fewer than we are lead to believe) would feel immense hostility.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s the difference? Cognitive dissonance. One intuitively knows the second self-evident statment to be true; in the case it goes against indoctrinated beliefs, the brain short-circuits and produces hostility. It is a common occurence with people that <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/aristotle100584.html">disagree with Aristotle.</a> Their beliefs are tied to their identity, so by challenging them one is attacking who they (think they) are.</p>

<p>This explains the TMoR phenomenon. Or at least the unpaid people who participate in that sub.</p>

<p>Your hardcore &#39;topmind&#39; type is about as rare as the rabid &quot;absolutely everything is the work of satan&quot; (or whatever) &quot;total&quot; conspiracy theorist. Most people just don&#39;t like thinking about how fucked everything is. The key is in talking about it in a way that doesn&#39;t force them to see themselves as vulnerable in order to accept it. I.e., 911 being an inside job as a conspiracy theory is much easier to convince people of if it&#39;s framed in a way that doesn&#39;t introduce the idea that the government is an all-powerful evil entity.</p>

<p>Imagine the story of 9/11 – in terms of the best efforts made to work out what really happened – told in the form of a black comedy. It would probably be a lot more convincing, and god wouldn&#39;t the pathos be a killer!</p>

<p>In the course of discussions of the whole phenomenon of criticism, a useful strategy may be to single out Epstein&#39;s theory for attack, using the attached Fletcher [?] article and Spectator piece for background. (Although Mark Lane&#39;s book is much less convincing that Epstein&#39;s and comes off badly where confronted by knowledgeable critics, it is also much more difficult to answer as a whole, as one becomes lost in a morass of unrelated details.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From CIA Document 1035-960 regarding conspiracy theories on the JFK assassination. Was CIA behind Edward Epstein&#39;s book <em>Inquest</em>? Maybe, maybe not. But what is clear is that they did prefer his particular book as a target of their efforts to discredit <em>all</em> alternative theories around the assassination. </p>

<p>Likewise, I think it&#39;s reasonable to speculate that they would still be using a similar tactic, or variations on the theme, of either manufacturing or elevating particular theories as a means to taint via guilt by association any theory that strays too far from the current Overton window. If the truth cannot be suppressed, it must at least be obfuscated or ridiculed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sad part is that the Earth actually is flat and conspiracy types are the most likely to scoff at it.  The entire point of the Occult (Copernicus was a sun worshiper, Newton was deep into the Occult etc.) creating the spinning ball illusion over the past 500 years was to hide the existence of God by discrediting the Bible.  The biggest conspiracy of them all is that the King James Bible is 100% literally true and the Satan worshiping world elite doesn&#39;t want you to know that.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s easier to explain than that. Subreddits are communities. Opinions are expressed, and if they are responded to positively, people are going to make an association of that thing with that subReddit.</p>

<p>Your last example is easier, but I think it would be more accurate with Trump supporters than conservatives. r/t_d is constantly posting hateful things about Mexicans, Muslims, and every other person of color, under the guise of illegals, immigrants, and terrorists. But the thing is, it&#39;s simply people of color under a questionable reasoning.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s not only accepted, but actually desired there, people make the association with racism/Nazism. How did Germany become Nazi/white only in their views? They wanted to get rid of any person of color, and probably used similar reasons early on.</p>

<p>I think less people make assumptions that conspiracy people are flat Earth people, unless they really haven&#39;t been exposed to anything but that kind of conspiracy. I also think a lot of things posted here are much more acceptable to the general population and only truly crazy shit like flat Earth strikes people as true conspiracy. I&#39;m talking general population, not the small area that is top minds.</p>

<p>But, I&#39;m just giving a different viewpoint to yours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are we tiptoeing around the truth? Reddit created a series of safe space rules 2 years ago that it uses to target users whom its employees are ideologically against. Just assume that if someone is harassing you and your values aren&#39;t aligned with the employees that you won&#39;t be protected and that you&#39;ll have a  target on your back when you try to have a voice of your own. This is the same site that banned the head mod of the largest alternative bernie sanders subreddit (main one is corrupt) for fucking downvoting a user who was spamming the subreddit.

Then they will all flood over there and spread various types of hyperbole and nonsense, while all secretly having a laugh at how &quot;cool&quot; it is going to be to meet up later back at the base to give each other high-fives.
The irony of course is that many times they are actually seeing their own hyperbole and comments designed to be &quot;something a crazy conspiracy theorist would say&quot; and then they are actually using those comments as examples or proof of how &quot;crazy&quot; conspiracy theorist are. Completely oblivious to the fact that they themselves are the ones going over-the-top pretending to be lunatics.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s people pointing out bullshit. Which is good. I like it when I see it done in comments here, rather than everyone just agree. Conversations evolve thru their differences of opinion more than anything else.</p>

<p>I think people need to develop thicker skin. So what someone thinks something you said is stupid, maybe it is, adapt or move on. Assume they&#39;re just some loser living in their moms basement, that&#39;s what the OP did.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we&#39;re all anonymous users that are hopefully enjoying the discussion wherever we are.</p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the drama between r/conspiracy and r/topmindsofreddit is its own little micro-conspiracy of divide and conquer. </p>

<p>Just remember while a lot of conspiracies are certainly real and have truth to them, most everyone is filled with all sorts of distortions and is acting on their own belief systems and knowledge and doing what they think best. Basically, have fun, learn as much as you can about topics that interest you, but try not to get too disturbed by them or caught up in what the mainstream world thinks of any of these ideas. After all, the mainstream world doesn&#39;t know shit :)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be afraid to talk about conspiracies either or subjects you have questions about. We are all working towards finding whatever truth we are seeking about whatever subjects we feel we have been lied to about, and IMO that is making the world a better place.</p>

<p>The real meat and potatoes of the subreddit. The things that sticks out for me the most is the dangerous level of superiority, and I do not say this in a mocking or insulting way.

    <div class="md"><p>Thats a false equivalency and you are making yourself out to be a victim.</p>

<p>Looking at the threads there, they pick and choose posts that they find ludicrous and make fun of it. Whilst people here labels users that disagree with them mocking names. The thread that this particular thread is mocking even states that many do not feel all thoughts here are dumb or all conspiracies are without merit. But some are off the wall. And looking again, not all the ones they make fun of come from this sub.</p>

<p>Topics here, also do the same thing. In the pizzagate thread, those who feel that the pizzagate theory was dumb are labeled pedos by some. Some who talk about trump are called shills and a whole bunch of &#39;muh russsia&#39; bs. The flat earthers are thoroughly maligned here (though i cant say its unwarranted). </p>

<p>Anyone who feels any msm (which encompasses any and everything apparently) has a valid point is an auto shill.</p>

<p>People get attacked in this sub quite a bit without so much of a second thought. But god forbid a select few posts that are off the wall get made fun of?</p>

<p>C&#39;mon, thats just feelings being hurt. And you can tell its feelings because TMOR is being made to be a giant conspiratorial mega demon that deserves its own sticky, as opposed to just a bunch of douchehats  raggin. </p>

<p>People get &quot;attacked&quot; when they come to this sub and post. We do not go out fishing for other people to mock. In fact, this may be the only thread of it&#39;s kind I&#39;ve ever seen. Yet this post is all you see on TMoR. </p>

<p>You are trying to say we&#39;re the same, we&#39;re not. TMoR exists to mock, we exist and sometimes mock. Again, two completely different things which you don&#39;t seem to want to acknowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well except Trump. He gets the blame for everything. These useless TMOR creeps are enabling criminals to sweep their crimes under the rag. All swept in one shot and all we need is a scape goat and a bunch of idiots to go along with the narrative. I&#39;m not saying Trump is all that innocent but usually the loudest mouths are usually the same ones who can&#39;t see how Hillary or Obama could be evil at all. They follow MSM and don&#39;t think a deep state exists yet they think themselves so highly opinionated because they simply cannot see past the theatre they are part of. So they feel proud to be that character of the show. It gives them confidence. But that&#39;s all they are, a character, and they&#39;ll do anything in their power to stay in that comfort and keep people away from truly discovering themselves, because the more people are part of their bubble, the longer they can keep their illusion going. I don&#39;t blame everyone who&#39;s caught up in the spell but these people really go out of their way to make sure the illusion keeps going. They don&#39;t even get paid to troll I&#39;d bet. It&#39;s amazing seeing an army of dedicated authoritarian people ready to do follow criminal leaders at will and even go out of their way to defend their narratives. It really is something. Are they cowards if they can&#39;t see things for what they are and not what they appear to be? I think they are just scared and are complelty weak minded individuals because of the sheer resistance they show.</p>

<p>Absolutely right. I&#39;d say people educated beyond their intelligence are way more nefarious than ignorant simpletons with no pretension of knowledge. Pseudo-erudites, they&#39;re a modern scourge; knowing too many words for one&#39;s capacity to handle them leads to fanaticism and bigotry.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what the socialization of higher education will do. Someone who would have been happy and healthy as a janitor now lives a life of misery as an diplomat or a journalist.</p>

<p>One of her attacks was &quot;I think you&#39;re a shill&quot; and nothing more. When I asked for details, she said she wasn&#39;t sure and just wanted other people to pile on and attack me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are taking things out of context and then over generalizing them.  Pulling the Nazi card has been a consistent pattern with shills, top minds, and/or Antifa.</p>

<p>You posted what I deemed to be a troll post designed to make others not to take the content in our sub seriously.  There were plenty of people in the community that wanted you to be banned as they too deemed you to be a shill.</p>

<p>I think she wanted others to voice their opinion on you.</p>

<p>Anyways, people can try out the sub and see how it goes instead of taking either of our word for it.  What does it matter if you get banned from a sub you don&#39;t care about anyways?</p>

<p>I think veterans of this sub know that banning someone for being a shill is a gray area.  r/conspiracy doesn&#39;t really do it.  We try to do it.  If you don&#39;t like that we try to do it, then stay on the main sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are pulling the Nazi card because that&#39;s not why we banned you.  It is clear that there is an agenda to label our sub as a safe haven for Nazis.  Not too surprising when that is the same narrative pushed in the media with Antifa vs. Neon-Nazis.</p>

<p>I am not pulling the Antifa card on you.  I used the word &quot;or&quot;.  It seems there are these new Antifa people popping up for us who would be indistinguishable from other shills or top minds if they didn&#39;t blurt out they were Antifa.</p>

<p>I detailed why we banned you.  It wasn&#39;t because I suspected you to be Antifa.  I don&#39;t have enough evidence to believe a given person is Antifa unless they say that they are at this time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with someone who says &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong&quot;.  Us not banning him shows we permit all views.  What we are trying to create is an environment of productive discussion.  I permitted you for a while until you made that post basically making a mockery of the sub among other things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people in the conspiracy community do have critical thinking.  It takes critical thinking to pierce the veil.  If you don&#39;t critically think, you will fall prey to mind control through means such as propaganda.</p>

<p>Only some think they are 100% correct.  The same goes for people outside the conspiracy community.  I think that conspiracy theorists are more likely to not completely accept things as 100% correct.</p>

<p>Why is it justified to mock someone when they &quot;lack basic critical thinking skills&quot;?  Everyone is born different with different personalities, strengths, and weaknesses.  Peoples&#39; experiences also shape who they are.  We all make our own choices but I think it is extremely difficult for some given the situation they enter into.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I have ever seen anyone call someone a normie here.  For me, this isn&#39;t about seeking attention from our grade school classmates.  There are always egotistical people but I think they are a lot less common in the conspiracy community.</p>

<p>As counterintuitive as it might seem, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/71rs6d/who_here_has_been_banned_from_rconspiracy_and_why/?st=J7WB3TXB&amp;amp;sh=f7ac8e7dhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/71rs6d/who_here_has_been_banned_from_rconspiracy_and_why/?st=J7WB3TXB&amp;amp;sh=f7ac8e7d">I assure you, that’s the case.</a> </p>

<p>I have experience with some of the users in that particular thread before they were banned in r/conspiracy and the attributes laid out by OP, are a fairly accurate representation of the kind of mind that is drawn to a sub like that.</p>

<p>Just scrolling through it I’m stuck by how anyone would actively exert time to mock others. Only (badly reared) children tend to do that- or the adults that they grow into.  Who has the time, <em>nay</em> inclination to engage in such pettiness but a juvenile who lacks the ability to emphasise or exercise independent, non authority-derived, critical thought?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t expect you to see reason. Clearly you&#39;ve tied your self worth to that of Trump no matter how terrible he fucks up. </p>

<p>Trump also lied about why Comey was fired and then admitted it was because of the Russian investigation. </p>

<p>Manafort and Flynn have had to resign because of them trying to cover up their shady Russian dealings. Sessions had to recuse himself for lying about meeting Russians. </p>

<p>Trump Jr lied over and over until the NYT was going to leak his emails.</p>

<p>Republicans spent years and millions trying to pin Bengazhi on Hillary and at the end admitted that she didn&#39;t do anything wrong. Yet you&#39;re angry that this investigation has taken months so far. Mmmkay. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think the ideal mentality would be somewhere between the stereotypical r/conspiracy and r/TMOR user. It does us no good to question literally <em>everything.</em> But we should still question anything that truly seems suspicious. Of course, what is &quot;suspicious&quot; will differ from person to person, but if you&#39;re going to say &quot;the mainstream explanation for [blank] is false,&quot; you should at least try to make a convincing argument for why your explanation is more plausible, and be prepared for others to tear it apart if it&#39;s bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel bad for those people, because they&#39;re going to figure it out eventually, and it&#39;s going to be really rough on them. The thing is that they look at us the same way we look at them. They genuinely think that we have some kind of &#39;nerd in his mom&#39;s basement&#39; superiority complex whereby we cling to conspiracy theories because it makes us feel special and reaffirms the idea that we know stuff other people don&#39;t know &amp; are thus better than them, which makes up for the fact we&#39;re really stuck in our mom&#39;s basement playing with our genitals. </p>

<p>I think one of the main problems preventing people from understanding what&#39;s really going on, is getting you head round this idea that &#39;everyone has to be in on it&#39; - I am someone who worked in mainstream media, I worked at a top university and am an academic and have worked on research projects with various government agencies and corporations like Facebook, Google, D-Wave, IBM, etc etc. And the people you meet seem like the same kind of people that you are, most of these people have no idea, they are all utterly brainwashed too. Most journalists I know fly into a rage if you question anything about the government&#39;s motives, because to them, these people are people they work with and talk to on a regular basis. What people don&#39;t understand is that those people aren&#39;t in on it, they perpetuate it because they are in that same bubble of completely unquestioning acceptance of the idea that all the people that are in the same circles as them and their bosses, and therefore their bosses bosses and etc, are the same as them - i.e. well meaning, striving for a better world, equality, peace etc. Uncomfortable things like war or the banker bailouts or the Panama Papers or NSA spying, they are all categorised as one-off anomalies.</p>

<p>Basically, until you see it for yourself, until you are there at an event and then you see it covered on the mainstream news completely erroneously, and you see it is being covered in such a way as to advance a particular agenda, and you know that it&#39;s not that a mistake has been made, because you&#39;ve contacted the media and told them the truth, and until you&#39;re trying to relate your actual lived experience about something and your receive the same scoffing and disbelief and mocking that you yourself used to direct at people who claimed things like Sandy Hook was faked or that the government was spraying chemicals from planes or modifying the weather or that there&#39;s a secret space program and aliens are being covered up... then it clicks, or at least starts to click. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned from my experience and from talking to people who have gone through this same thing - a lot of people &#39;woke up&#39; with Trump and Brexit, because a lot of people were involved in something that they could see so clearly being utterly misrepresented in the media, and finally it clicked - these people are not telling the truth, they can&#39;t be trusted.. and then everything you&#39;ve ever believed, or been told, is suddenly thrown into question - all of reality is up for grabs, which I guess is why some people go full on into flat earth etc, it&#39;s almost like a traumatic reaction to the realisation that you really don&#39;t know anything because you&#39;ve so far trusted your perception of reality to sources that are now proven to be lying and manipulative.</p>

<p>And the thing about these people who go all out with the attacking the conspiracy theorists are often the people who deep down feel that there is something wrong, just beyond their consciousness, and their focus on tearing down &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; is often because somewhere inside they are terrified, they can&#39;t bear for it to be true, they&#39;re actively refusing to let it be true by trying to talk or write or circle jerk it out of existence. But they can&#39;t ignore it. Kind of like a closet gay person who goes all out with the homophobia.</p>

<p>So, the point of my saying all this is to say - if we want these people to understand and see the truth of things, then the best way to do it is to keep showing the discrepancies between media stories and other evidence/footage etc. Keep small to start with, I see way too many people trying to wake people up and going straight to all the Illuminati, Luciferian elites stuff, or other really way out there things, but I&#39;ve found a lot of success with just showing people the small things, something that they&#39;re not going to instantly dismiss and ridicule, but something that shows without doubt, that the mainstream media is deliberately lying, and just ask them why, keep asking them, why are they lying about this? Just one small thing at a time, one small fact, without going into the details of what you&#39;ve subsequently found out about the whole agenda behind it, or all the conspiracies, just keep to the facts and ask them the questions, ask them to explain it to you in a way that makes sense within the world view they are espousing. And when they do that intellectual work for themselves, and realise that they cannot make sense of it, that is when the brain washing starts to break down, that&#39;s when the crisis begins and they start tentatively looking into these things for themselves, uncovering more and more evidence, more of the bigger picture, and before you know it, they&#39;ll be calling you up and yelling &#39;I can&#39;t believe Michelle Obama is a man!!!&#39; (Well that&#39;s what happened with my Dad anyway, who is a scientist and used to watch CNN religiously). :-)</p>

<p>This is the one that really irks me. It has been <em>proven</em> that false flags were used to make Native Americans look like terrorists while we were colonizing. It has been <em>proven</em> that several countries in WW1 and WW2 used false flag attacks to rally support. It is <em>very commonly believed, if not proven</em> that there were false flag attacks at a fairly high rate before the year 1950, all the way back to the formation of the first real governments thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>People believe, somehow, that false flag attacks no longer happen in our lifetimes, for the first time in 5000 years, because the government said they no longer happen.</p>

<p>I bet many of them are narcissistic.  </p>

<p>If you have ever met a narcissist you&#39;ll know that they do feel superior, and they project (i.e., they&#39;ll accuse you of doing the thing they are doing).   </p>

<p>I&#39;ve really tried to figure out how exactly narcissistic projection takes place, because it really is bizarre to see first hand - how can this person accuse you of doing what they just did?   </p>

<p>What I think is that narcissists have a very high degree of <em>intolerance for cognitive dissonance.</em>  So, the primary thought they have about themselves is &quot;they are better than other people, and whatever imperfections they have are minor.&quot;  </p>

<p>So, whenever you present a narc with evidence of an imperfection they can not tolerate it.  It contradicts their primary belief that &quot;they are perfect.&quot;  So they then accuse the person that points out their imperfection as being the actual possessor of the imperfection.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know.  Still doesn&#39;t quite add up, but its as close as I can get to understanding their mental processes.</p>

They resorted to rude personal attacks and then I  was banned without warning or explanation. No response to my question &#39;why&#39;  yet.</p>

<p>Very difficult for me to believe anything other than content censorship.  Didn&#39;t like what I was posting and I crushed the trolls.</p>

<p>Is there a greater sin than censorship for a media organization? It&#39;s akin to actively lying but at least active liars permit the other side to be heard in the marketplace of ideas. Yes ... censorship is worse than actively lying. This will go down on all of their permanent records.</p>

<p>Disappointed and disturbed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i am new to these subreddits like r/conspiracy and i tried to read throu both sides commentars etc.
(Im from switzerland so.. You know im &quot;neutral&quot; as people like to say lol) btw. My grammar is shit sometimes so im sorry.</p>

<p>Here is the thing, i belive in some theories for sure because they are SO fking obvious. Or there ARE actually things happening which are proven. For example: chemtrails.. The US themself reportet that the army &quot;tested&quot; bacterial weapons in San-Francisco.
I do belive that 9/11 is made by the goverment or something like that. Just because of these TONS of HIGHLY suspecious storys behind it.
And a few other things are out there that are not trustworthy.</p>

<p>Your post is pretty good. Especially the part where i comfront people is about.. Beliving everything in the media atc.
Just think back. In history class i ALWAYS had people that ask about WW1/2:&quot;but why did all the people follow this bad guy?&quot;
Well, media etc. Back then people did not have the easy way of communicating all around the world. He made false flag attscks and so on.
Ask the most people today how they feel about russia. Many people think they are super bad. Especially putin. Its just the fking same which happends right here. (I dont want to say he is the best guy in the world.. Some shit happends there too) but if you look at the history etc in the past years, russia has IMPROVED A LOT. And they minded somewhat their own buissness and kept things small for such a big country. Just in the past years things got heated up again.</p>

<p>And belive me if i say, the media here in switzerland is fking bad, horrible and hilarious in staging things.
Making up statistics where a 12yo. can see something is smelly about it. </p>

<p>Now, about all this drama here there is a backstory which is happening with my friend. He goes full nuts sometimes and discusses things like flat earth and sometimes seems to be convinced about it.
And i dont belive in it.
For example he always laughts about since reports and how they explain why the earth is round.. Gravitation, and that all the space stuff is just lies.
 And the biggest thing that trigfers him is something like that.
&quot;what is it about theories? you cant say, it is shit just because it is a theory. If we WANT to solve something that is a problem, come up with a solution or WHATEVER we HAVE to make a theory first, which is most of the time, based on observation.
Otherwise you can go by yourself.. Unlearn EVERYTHING you have learned throu shool and can make up things by yourself which are proven and not just theorys.. Oh wait. You cant. Because, first of you have to make a theory.&quot;</p>

<p>Again about gouverment. I fking hate to see ours here debating about anything. They are worse as some kindergarden kids. I could find some 12yo boyos which can have a better conversation as our high people. All they do is.. One dude brings up some facts and the other litelary denies it by blaming him in some way. Which makes no sense at all.</p>

<p>And here it is somewhat the same SOMETIMES.
Conspiracy people bring up stuff.. With some nice facts which makes it better. The other partie just denies it with. &quot;oh jeah.  Hehe flatearth is also something you belive in? Hue hue hue. Scrub.&quot;
If it is trolling.. Or he just WONT listen to the fact. Dont fking discuss it with this dude.
Just dont.
And sometimes it is the other way around.. Someone says, the sky is just some sort of hologram that is why the ISIS is fake etc. I cant argue against it.. It is just something you belive in but with no evidence and you just denie my part with your belive. And one thing i dont like, which my friend does. Is &quot;Teaching&quot; someone else about something with full on belive while not being better or having ANY idea about it. He is no astrophysic dude which can solve difficult math problems etc.</p>

<p>It is sometimes the same way around. So fking calm down everyone and also just argue like adults if you want to be something better. Jeez i just wanna read throu some nice leaks or discuss a topic but not have every second post about how shitty mainstream people are.
Its hilarious from both sides sometimes if i go throu these posts. Get a grip. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll break it down.</p>

<p>-they control both sides
-they astroturf disinformation like flat earth and reptilians 
-they come and debunk said information that they created in the first place 
-they have different groups that are assigned to cognitively infiltrate different subjects 
-they are engaged in social engineering both sides of the dialectic 
-they will encourage you to not &quot;brigade&quot; topminds because they don&#39;t want real discourse, they rather &quot;balkanize&quot; the internet and keep people boxed in to their own echochambers, just like how jewish facebook algorithms only show you likeminded posts. It&#39;s better to separate groups into: The antithesis (conspiracy theorists). the Thesis (basic bitch good goyim from topminds) and then the SYNTHESIS, which equals a conflict between the two resulting in conspiracy theorists getting discredited in the eyes of the masses. </p>

<p>Thats a gross oversimplification. The current storm they&#39;re cooking up is much more sinister and dangerous. All the squabbling over identity politics is a psyop to pit people against one another. </p>

<p>Now, this isn&#39;t going to fly with some of you, both sides are probably going to cry out in pain and downvote, but thats okay, reddit is for faggots and downvotes ain&#39;t even a thang. </p>

<p>Basically, it all comes back to the hegelian dialectic. Right now we have a storm brewing between 2 factions: left/right, alt-right/antifa, globalists/nationalists, republicans/democrats, Breitbart/Huffington post etc. Both sides are retarded. Alt-right nazifrogs from 4chan are just as bad as blue haired antifa trannies, both go in the trash along with the intelligence agencies who bankroll them. </p>

<p>You can call them both &quot;countercultures&quot; if you want, but they&#39;re both just taking real grassroots dissent and mutating it into useful idiocy. For instance, Andrew Brietbart was the pioneer of both Breitbart AND the Huffington Post. </p>

<p>This whole right/left paradigm is a game of charades </p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people in the conspiracy community do have critical thinking.  It takes critical thinking to pierce the veil.  If you don&#39;t critically think, you will fall prey to mind control through means such as propaganda.</p>

<p>Only some think they are 100% correct.  The same goes for people outside the conspiracy community.  I think that conspiracy theorists are more likely to not completely accept things as 100% correct.</p>

<p>Why is it justified to mock someone when they &quot;lack basic critical thinking skills&quot;?  Everyone is born different with different personalities, strengths, and weaknesses.  Peoples&#39; experiences also shape who they are.  We all make our own choices but I think it is extremely difficult for some given the situation they enter into.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I have ever seen anyone call someone a normie here.  For me, this isn&#39;t about seeking attention from our grade school classmates.  There are always egotistical people but I think they are a lot less common in the conspiracy community.</p>
