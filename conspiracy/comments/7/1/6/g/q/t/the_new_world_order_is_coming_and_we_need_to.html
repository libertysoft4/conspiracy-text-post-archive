    <div class="md"><p>sure if one of us protests by not paying taxes they might come with guns to haul me into court ... but what about an entire nation wakes up and says enough is enough and decides that all these taxes we pay are no longer serving us. </p>

<p>we still have free will to drop the slave mentality is my point. if that means they violently come for us maybe that will only serve to wake more ppl up to monster they are supporting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire nation has less then 30% of all of the wealth of the country. What the fuck can you do? You think that a mob marching to a building is going to stop them? You think riots in a city is going to stop them? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s run a scenario let&#39;s say that the popluation of a city rebelles against the government this is what&#39;s going to happen.</p>

<p>Step 1 the corporate media would say that the riots are been pushed by terrorist , all social media is shutdown or controlled.</p>

<p>Step 2 the government will initiate Martial law... Meaning you have no rights.</p>

<p>Step3. They will shut down power and water </p>

<p>STEP4 THEY WILL ROUND UP ANYBODY THAT THEY HAVE ON THERE LIST, AND PUT THEM IN INTERMENT CAMPS.</p>

<p>Step5 the main stream media will focus on the terros this people did.</p>

<p>STEP6 THEY WILL KILL EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE INTERMENT CAMPS BY SAYING THE TERRORIS USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS.</p>

<p>Step 7 random acts of terrorism will continue and new acts of control will happen.</p>

<p>Step 8 reduction of the popluation to a controllable level.</p>

<p>Step 9 they win.</p>

<p>The only way we could prevent this is if the rich get divided and they fight among themselves this is what the Rothschilds did to the nobility. </p>

<p>But this happening is impossible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Na dude, people can&#39;t stop using Facebook, or snapchat or Imagur or Reddit or any type of entertainment been YouTube , Netflix, Hulu, Amazon or the corporate media. 
They take the taxes automatically, by taxing the companies first (if you get paid 50k a year a company need to pay 20 k to the Government in payroll tax) then they take your income tax usually 1/3 of your take home check. Then they tax everything you buy or sell. 
Oh and if you think living of the grid is an option. In Florida if your house (one that is completely payed for) is off the grid meaning it uses solar and rain water you will lose the property to the city.... How you like them apples? Oh you want to head for the woods or deserts? A homeless man in Arizona was killed by cops when they found he was camping in govement land with no permit. Oh you want to fish? You need a permit... Oh you want to hunt ? You need a permit (basically give your money to the king tax) </p>

<p>Yep how are you planning to not pay taxes? What&#39;s your suggestion? Details boy... If not then I would say grow the fuck up. Its over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When people say they want to &#39;spread awareness&#39;, my question is, &#39;why?&#39;</p>

<p>Before downvoting me, just hear me out.</p>

<p>Almost nobody in America still believes the official story of JFK. Even at the time, large swathes of people were highly suspicious. This was their President, and a fairly popular one at that, struck down in almost movie-like circumstances. </p>

<p>Did anybody rise up? Was there a revolution? No.</p>

<p>Fewer and fewer people believe the official story of the &#39;Moon Landings&#39;, but so what? They go to work, pay their taxes, life goes on.</p>

<p>So what does &#39;spreading awareness&#39; achieve? Is it some utopian ideal of, &#39;if only more people find out, then something will happen&#39;? Is it to make you feel less lonely if others agree with you?</p>

<p>Please, help me out here.</p>

<p>This really is a simple question. I hope other people reading this comment thread can see what is going on here. When you question &#39;truth&#39; evangelists as to why they want to spread their &#39;truth&#39;, they don&#39;t actually have a thought-out reason. It is truly remarkable.</p>

<p>I know this because I used to be a &#39;truth&#39; evangelist myself, until one day somebody got me to ask myself <em>why</em> I was doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can confirm that I am part of the organization that will instill this &quot;New World Order&quot;. There is no stopping it. However, contrary to popular belief, it is not the 1% but the 1% of the 1%. We are not your enemy, we are your saviours. Understand what this means--look at the bigger picture and don&#39;t be scared. We have before us an opportunity to instill for ourselves and for future generations an order in which the rule of law will govern the conduct of all nations. An order that will give a credible United Nations the ability to fulfill its promises as envisioned by its founders. Under one world government, we will be able to remove the bureaucracy from separate governments that serves only to cause conflict, war and death. Under one world government, we will work towards advancing the human species. We will be able to live in peace, live equally and live in a world in which everyone is taken care of. You can believe me, you can not, it makes no difference. You yourself will end up siding with the coming change. You&#39;re welcome to message me for details, I am here to only help out and give information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sure if one of us protests by not paying taxes they might come with guns to haul me into court ... but what about an entire nation wakes up and says enough is enough and decides that all these taxes we pay are no longer serving us. </p>

<p>we still have free will to drop the slave mentality is my point. if that means they violently come for us maybe that will only serve to wake more ppl up to monster they are supporting.</p>
