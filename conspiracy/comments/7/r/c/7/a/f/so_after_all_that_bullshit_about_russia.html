    <div class="md"><p>Well let&#39;s see, Trumps criminal campaign manager was charged for money laundering. Why did Trump hire a ciminal with deep ties to Russian money laundering? Papadopulous was charged with lying to the FBI about connections to Russia. Flynn took a plea deal for lying to the FBI about Russia. He got a potential 60 year jail sentence reduced to 6 months, so that doesn&#39;t come cheap. Were you under the impression that Russia had nothing to do with any of these indictments? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What ties to Russian money?  He had connections to a Ukraine Group (as did Hillary&#39;s campaign manager who also flirts with not registering as FARA) that is favorable towards Russia.  All the transactional detail is long before Trump ran for President for Manafort.</p>

<p>Regarding Flynn, there is literally no evidence of Russian collusion.</p>

<p>Who is Global Endeavor Inc anyway?  Check it out on ICIJ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not true at all though.  Manafort&#39;s ties are to the Ukraine (as did Gates/Podesta Group).  The charges are stated to have nothign to do with the Trump campaign (same for Gates).

<p>Papadopolous, jury is still out on that dope.  As far as I can tell, he got player in a major way.  Who was the ISraeli diplomat that set up the meeting with the Aussie guy?  Anyone know?  From the evidence available though, it looks like he was eager to get the team in on this email info he had and no one responded to him.  Further, it proves the Trump team had nothing to do with the emails if Russia was apparently delivering breadcrumbs to someone to grab their attention RE emails.</p>

<p>RE Flynn, I&#39;m pretty ok about that because I&#39;m curious to find out what the basis of his being surveilled was that the FBI would know about his conversations with Kislyak.  It&#39;s completely normal and standard for an incoming team to have conversations with foreign nations and especially nations the incoming team intends to approach differently.  Wondering if this was oneo f the over 200 instances of Samantha Power requesting unmasking in the lead up to the election.</p>

<p>It kind of is, considering that Kushner and the Trump Org are notorious for money laundering. Why else would the Trump Org hire Felix Sater?</p>

<p>So you&#39;re assuming a large group of people all unified in feeling the same way which then leads you to believe they are suspicious. This is exactly way the investigation is retarded even if there is wrong doing. You&#39;re making assumptions and telling people what they think and feel. Why is someone not allowed to ridicule something they feel deserves it? Because it upsets you or goes against your regurgitated narrative? Why is someone automatically a Trump supporter because they don&#39;t support an investigation over a year later with nothing but weak at best signs of <em>possible</em> collusion (which is not a crime).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s fruit that has led to more fruit, which is still under investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I&#39;ll ask the same question again. SPECIFICALLY without deflecting what fruit has been yielded? Besides &quot;more fruit&quot; which is not an answer. And besides whatever you Google and pull up on CNN.com</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what the hell are you talking about? I&#39;m not telling people what they think and feel. I don&#39;t even understand what you could possibly be referring to.</p>

<p>the &quot;fruit&quot; is obviously the multiple members of Trump&#39;s administration who have been charged with crimes based on discoveries made during Mueller&#39;s investigation:
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/who-has-been-charged-in-russia-investigation-mueller-trump-2017-12/#michael-flynn-trumps-former-national-security-adviser-4">http://www.businessinsider.com/who-has-been-charged-in-russia-investigation-mueller-trump-2017-12/#michael-flynn-trumps-former-national-security-adviser-4</a></p>

<p>They are &quot;fruit leading to other fruit&quot; because these charges are likely being used to force these people to give evidence that would lead to charges against more of those involved.</p>

<p>The investigation is ongoing, and only Trump-associated people are making any claims that it is pointless. Actual Americans who care about their country want the investigation to proceed as it should so we can uncover any other possible misdeeds.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t be replying anymore to this thread because you are being purposefully obtuse.</p>

<p>Once again projecting feelings/thoughts onto someone. </p>

<p>All of your comments are full of ignorant hugely generalizing assumptions about almost half the country. </p>

<p>But fair enough - I don&#39;t consider that &quot;fruit&quot; at all but you won&#39;t be replying to me cause you&#39;re so knowledgeable so good day. Keep reading mainstream media and eating it up, definitely not a contradiction while on this sub.</p>
