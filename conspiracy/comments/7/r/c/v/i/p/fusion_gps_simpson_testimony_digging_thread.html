<p><strong><em>Page 57 - Did not say everything is true, does not know if anything is false</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>MR. ROONEY: Do you - did you find anything to -- that you verified as
false in the dossier, since or during?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: I have not seen anything -</p>

<p>MR. ROONEY: So everything in that dossier, as far as you&#39;re concerned,
is true or could be true?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: I didn&#39;t say that. What I said was it was credible at the
time it came in. We were able to corroborate various things that supported its
credibility.</p>

<p>MR. ROONEY: Well, do you know now if anything&#39;s false?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: I did answer that. No, I don&#39;t know if anything is false. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Page 19+ on Perkins Coie / working for DNC</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>MR. GOWDY: Mr. Simpson, were you aware that Perkins Coie was
retained by the DNC?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: I&#39;m aware. I was aware of that and have been for years
that they have -- they were one of the main lawyers for the Democratic party, yes.
I don&#39;t have any specific awareness -</p>

<p>MR. GOWDY: That wasn&#39;t my precise question. With respect to this fact
pattern, with respect to your firm being retained, were you aware that Perkins Coie
was working on behalf of the DNC?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: Yes. I mean, I know that they are - the DNC is a client
of Perkins Coie. I don&#39;t - I didn&#39;t see it -- nobody gave me a document or
informed me specifically of that. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>MR. GOWDY: I&#39;m looking at a release from Perkins Coie that is giving me
more information than you are. Have you seen the release where they released
you from some of your confidentiality obligations?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: I would like to see a copy of that, if you don&#39;t mind.</p>

<p>MR. GOWDY: Do your lawyers not have it?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: It&#39;s been a busy time. Okay. Okay. I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m not
giving you a clear answer. I knew it was the DNC that we were working for. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Page 27 regarding vetting sources:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>MR. GOWDY: Were you able to vet or corroborate or contradict any of the
sources or subsources?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: We did get into assessing the credibility of the sources
and whether they were in a position to know the things that they were saying. I
didn&#39;t ask for the specific identities of specific people. Some people, I think I know
who they are for other reasons. But that&#39;s about as much as I can say.
We did a lot of -- when the first reports came In, we did a lot of discussing of
whether this was credible information. And obviously, evaluating human
Intelligence is not the same thing as looking at documents. And so it&#39;s a much
trickier process and the thresholds are different. And so what you&#39;re really trying
to do, which is kind of like interviewing in journalism, is figure out whether there&#39;s
reason to think that what&#39;s being said is credible. And so we did a lot of that. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Page 28+ on the quality of information</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>MR. GOWDY: Yes, I&#39;m sure we will get into that. My other question is,
was there anything not included in your report that you concluded was wrong? In
other words, I think my primary question was, is there anything that Steele, his
sources or subsources told you that you didn&#39;t include because you immediately
found it to be incredible? And I think your answer was no.</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: That is correct. My answer to that is no... </p>

<p>MR. GOWDY: And how did you assess the reliability of that information,
given the fact that you did not talk to the sources or subsources?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: So it&#39;s obviously a challenging thing to assess human
intelligence, field interviews, and it is different from looking at a lawsuit. But there
are similarities to the interview process in journalism, where there are elements of
people, what people say that you can check... And in a way, it is like journalism, because they are somewhat rigid in
reporting what sources in the field are saying, and, you know, they - they don&#39;t do
a lot of the -- this is what this guy said, but we don&#39;t think it&#39;s true or we believe this
or we believe that he might have gotten the data wrong. They just - it&#39;s a kind of
a here&#39;s what they said type report. </p>

<p><strong>Page 34+ on Fusion beginning research into Trump&#39;s Russia ties during their time working for the Free Beacon</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>MR. SCHIFF: During the time that you·were doing work for Free Beacon,
you had mentioned some work in the first phase. You had discovered business
relationships with Felix Sater and Bayrock. By first phase, do you mean while you
were doing work for Free Beacon?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: It was one of the first things we found. And I should
emphasize, it was, you know -- originally I saw it in the New York Times article, so
it. wasn&#39;t a great investigative discovery. But then when I read into it and I found
depositions in which he was, you know, more than evasive about the relationship,
that&#39;s when I got really interested.</p>

<p>MR. SCHIFF: So during the period of time you were working for Free
Beacon, you came across some of the first information about candidate Trump&#39;s
business ties in Russia, including those with Felix Sater.</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: Yep, that&#39;s correct. And lots of other issues came up
during the primaries that raised concerns in my mind about whether there might be
connections -- Donald Trump might have unexplained connections to Russia or
people involved in that part of the world. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Page 56 on source credibility</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>MR. ROONEY: Did you generally consider them credible, if you knew
them?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: Well, you can&#39;t -- I mean, I can&#39;t evaluate the credibility of
someone on the other side of the --</p>

<p>MR. ROONEY: So you just trusted Mr. Steele&#39;s vouch?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: I have great trust in Mr. Steele&#39;s professional ability to find
sources with credible information.</p>

<p>MR. ROONEY: Did you know how he paid these sources?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON : Yeah. You know, essentially, my -- what I was doing
was corroborating the information they were providing -- or trying to -- or
determining whether it was credible. So that was a lot of the work that we did
there. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Page 144 on deaths after release</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>MS. SPEIER: And it appears that one of the sources was mysteriously
killed?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: That&#39;s not my information. I mean there was a series of
episodes where people were arrested or died mysteriously that came shortly after
the disclosure of the existence of this information. And I do believe there was a
bit of an old fashioned purge. </p>

<p>The Turkey-Russia connection I think is deeper than is generally understood. I think that the Turkey-Russia -- I think that the influence campaign that General Flynn got caught up In is reflective of that. And I think it&#39;s not been excavated. And I think that Roger Stone may have connections to that matter that are unexplored.</p>

<p>MR. SCHIFF: Why do you say that?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: Things I heard from sources. I think Ted Malloch is an important person in this whole picture. And he may have had some role in all that. He is an interesting person who crosses over from Brexit, UKIP, Trump, and the Turkey-Russia issue. And then the last thing I would add is, you know, we haven&#39;t talked about Deutsche Bank at all. You know, I think they obviously know a fair bit. But they are obviously within your subpoena power, and I am assuming you probably already asked them to provide information.</p>

<p>I assume redacted is Devin Nunes. Why redact his name? And that&#39;s the first I&#39;ve heard of this Ted Malloch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Relevant to today’s news about the FBI looking into the NRA and Torshin, see my earlier post today about Trump answering Butina’s question about Russian policy at a 2015 rally in Vegas by indicating that he’d drop sanctions if given the chance</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MS. SPEIER: Okay. What is the interest of Russia with the National Rifle Association?</p>

<p>MR. SIMPSON: I think that most of what we have found is pretty much out there now. You know, it&#39;s been said by others, but, you know, what eventually - it appears the Russians, you know, infiltrated the NRA And there is more than one explanation for why. But I would say broadly speaking, it appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations. And they targeted various conservative organizations, religious and otherwise, and they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the NRA.</p>

<p>And so there is a Russian banker-slash-Duma member-slash-Mafia leader named Alexander Torshin who is a life member of the NRA. And we spent a lot of time investigating Mr. Torshin.And he is well known to Spanish law enforcement for money laundering activity, and you have probably seen the press articles. And I think the Spanish files on him should be available to you.And he, as you know, was supposed to have a meeting with President Trump after the inauguration. And somebody noticed that there had been some stories about him that weren&#39;t pretty good .</p>

<p>So he is one of the more important figures, but, you know, another woman with whom he was working, Maria Butina, also was a big Trump fan in Russia, and then suddenly showed up here and started hanging around the Trump transition after the election and rented an apartment and enrolled herself at AU,which I assume gets you a visa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not what money laundering is.  </p>

<p>The whole point of money laundering is that the money is from criminal activity - i.e. &quot;dirty money&quot;.  That&#39;s why you &quot;launder&quot; (clean) it.  That is the actual definition, you can&#39;t make a new one because it fits your narrative.  Here is the wiki link again since you obviously didn&#39;t read it the first time: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering</a></p>

<p>Paying a company to do work for you, and then the use that money to hire people is not money laundering.  Not even a little bit.</p>

<p>And how is the research &quot;shady&quot;?  And if it is false information, why would you even research it?  They could have just made it up without paying anyone.  You make no sense.</p>

<p>you can tell it&#39;s him because he uses similar usernames, goes through people&#39;s post histories trying to expose them, and uses lots of emojis.</p>

<p>he has also admitted to ban evasion multiple times.</p>

<p>So if watergate happened now, you would think that DeepThroat was the real criminal for exposing Nixon because he went to WaPo reporters?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, people like Alex Jones with their nonsense do give conspiracy theorists a bad name and people who see conspiracies in everything are a problem too. My standard is that a conspiracy is good if it&#39;s hard to refute it, so argue against it till you yourself can&#39;t doubt it. Very rarely do I see a good conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are clearly judging the veracity of conspiracies with a partisan motive. I don&#39;t believe in either, but I also would never isolate the two poster childs (of the left) to discredit conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>I think there is a lot of creepy stuff that happened with regards to politicians of all colors.  I think it would be naive to assume that anyone is immune in this current climate, and I think the people who argue about  &quot;pizzagate&quot; have some fair points.  There is a lot of dark/twisted stuff that needs to be explained. </p>

<p>I think things have to be explained in the Moore and Trump camp as well. With regards to a lot of these issues you just have to look at like detectives would... Who has the motive in the situation?  What is the evidence? Are there reasons to question the veracity of the claims due to the people making them? The list goes on and on. </p>

<p>Critical thinking does not have a political motive.  It searches for the facts and the evidence.  That&#39;s what I try to do. </p>

<p>Can say that because most of conspiracy is right wing, they pretend to be non partisan but most of it is to simply attack left and the Democrats, it&#39;s just the demographic. I am a realist, I don&#39;t pretend something that isn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never viewed pizzagate as isolated in the rights camp.  The idea is that it involves people in the highest reaches of power, kind of like the [Franklin Coverup](np.reddit.com<a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/6b4kus/for_all_the_pizzagate_doubters_you_must_first/">/r/conspiracy/comments/6b4kus/for_all_the_pizzagate_doubters_you_must_first/</a>), the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3sfiai/the_dutroux_affair/">Dutroux Affair</a>, the recent sexual assault claims made in Hollywood, etc.  There are a lot of examples that add weight to the claim that this is occurring.  Whether it involves pizza is another rabbit hole that I don&#39;t believe is true.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is completely inaccurate.  Before the last election, [most conspiracies](np.reddit.com<a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/4g7jay/updated_compilation_of_confirmed_conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/comments/4g7jay/updated_compilation_of_confirmed_conspiracy/</a>) did not belong to a political party.  Most still don&#39;t today, but some of the ones getting the most attention are political in nature.   </p>

<p>Using the word conspiracy theory instantly causes suspicion about something (which it should not).  Trump-Russia connection is a conspiracy.  Julian Assange being holed up in an embassy is a conspiracy, etc.</p>

What do you want to bet that they didn’t put all of their eggs in the “Trump wins the primaries” basket. They were doing 702 “about inquiries” way before the FISA warrant</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Page 34+ on Fusion beginning research into Trump&#39;s Russia ties during their time working for the Free Beacon
MR. SCHIFF: During the time that you·were doing work for Free Beacon, you had mentioned some work in the first phase. You had discovered business relationships with Felix Sater and Bayrock. By first phase, do you mean while you were doing work for Free Beacon?
MR. SIMPSON: It was one of the first things we found. And I should emphasize, it was, you know -- originally I saw it in the New York Times article, so it. wasn&#39;t a great investigative discovery. But then when I read into it and I found depositions in which he was, you know, more than evasive about the relationship, that&#39;s when I got really interested.
MR. SCHIFF: So during the period of time you were working for Free Beacon, you came across some of the first information about candidate Trump&#39;s business ties in Russia, including those with Felix Sater.
<strong>MR. SIMPSON: Yep, that&#39;s correct. And lots of other issues came up during the primaries that raised concerns in my mind about whether there might be connections -- Donald Trump might have unexplained connections to Russia or people involved in that part of the world.</strong></p>
