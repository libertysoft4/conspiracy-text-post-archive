I know every generation is different but people my age almost seem alien when compared to their parents and grandparents.</p>

<p>Anyways, It was nice to have an actual conversation that wasn’t about something in pop culture. </p>

<p>It was strange how not one time did anyone get sarcastic or talk about some “quirky” weird shit solely for the sake of talking about some quirky weird shit.</p>

<p>No one took any selfies, no one was glued to their smartphone while ignoring the people around them. No one was talking about memes or the latest pop artist.</p>

<p>It was just normal everyday talk about our lives, our day and our surroundings.</p>

<p>Life is gonna suck when all the old people die. They’re not all perfect or anything, far from it actually, but at least they’re like genuine human beings.</p>

<p>Once they’re gone all we’ll be left with is a bunch of selfie taking, narcissistic clones whose personalities were crafted for them by TEEVEE and social media.</p>

<p>The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.</p>

<p>Obviously Socrates did not write in English, so this quote must be from a <em>translation</em>. And that translation must be from the <em>original</em> document/papyrus, right? Wrong.</p>

<p>Try this for yourself. See if you can find the <strong>original</strong> works of Socrates. Then try to find the oldest &#39;translation&#39; of his works and see what they supposedly based their &#39;translation&#39; upon.</p>

I find the conversation to be very pleasant and interesting, and thoroughly enjoy hearing about the past. You can get some good advice from older generations for sure. </p>

<p>I find it funny they always seem to think they are taking up my time from something else. That almost always comes up and I have to explain that no, I’m exactly where I want to be and am talking to exactly who I want to talk to. That I am not doing it to be nice. </p>

<p>Cultural Marxism&quot; is a snarl word used to paint anyone with progressive tendencies as a secret Communist. The term alludes to a conspiracy theory in which sinister left-wingers have infiltrated media, academia, and science and are engaged in a decades-long plot to undermine Western culture. Some variants of the conspiracy alleges that basically all of modern social liberalism is, in fact, a Communist front group.</p>

<p>Marxist ideology in regards to social constructs had more to do with which jobs the genders traditionally took and why it wasn&#39;t the only pattern to follow.

<p>Metapedia is certainly not nice, in any form of the word, not as a starting point, nor a middle or end. It&#39;s fair to say that metapedia is wikipedia for white supremacists. It&#39;s even in their mission statement. </p>

<p>I did watch John le Bon&#39;s video, but after doing a bit of research on him as well, the only thing I have left is regret that we&#39;ve both wasted so much of each other&#39;s time. </p>

<p>In your opinion, what is the purpose of the transgender indoctrination? Who does it benefit and why are the architects doing it?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not OP but I&#39;ll go out on a limb and give you my wild speculation.</p>

<p>A purpose is to limit the liability of corporations that have poisoned people over generations with xenoestrogens. If I was a consultant to a corporation that was worried about being bankrupted by civil suits I&#39;d have them get some marketing guys on astroturfing genetic and biological damage as an alternative culture.</p>

<p>It benefits the employees, stockholders, tax collectors, currency creators, and anyone who wants to just be able to go to the store and pick up an ice cold Coke.</p>

<p>Like I said, it&#39;s just speculation. I don&#39;t really care how people dress or what they call themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t a thesis like that depend on the supposition that transgenders are a recent phenomenon? </p>

<p>There have always been people who have felt as if they were born the wrong sex and decided to live as the other. This isn&#39;t a new thing. </p>

<p>The spread of it can be explained by 2 things. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Advances in medical science can now let people surgically modify themselves to resemble/become their desired/preferred sex. </p></li>
<li><p>The internet. Much easier to find like minded people and acceptance. Can create echo Chambers, ect. Also easier to reveal their existence.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s a bold claim...that there&#39;s some corporation dumping chemicals into the water and making people so sick in the head they identify as trans. Do you have any evidence to back that up? </p>

<p>The closest I&#39;ve been able to find is not close at all. Alex Jones screaming about gay frogs. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it just possible those people are different than some and choose to live their lives how they want? Much like how people panicked over kids being notified that homosexuals do exist and aren&#39;t bad for being homosexuals. There were plenty of outlandish and  unhinged theories that tried to &quot;explain the gays&quot; as well as a whole fuckton of lies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s baffling to me, in this sub there&#39;s is so much outrage that no one else is worried about the real problems. &quot;Everyone is fighting each other at the behest of TPTB like puppets.&quot; Isn&#39;t this exactly the kind of shit the evil overlords would devise? Hate the other, for they are different. They choose to think and live different. Non standard. Bad. </p>

<p>Maybe trans people are all mentally ill, maybe one day they&#39;ll all wake up and realize they were wrong and then regret all the medical procedures and drugs. I mean, that&#39;s far-fetched as it gets, but maybe, right? I just don&#39;t see what the harm is. They&#39;re only hurting themselves it that&#39;s the case.</p>

<p>Why not rage against tabacoo users with the same relentlessness? Those are honest to goodness idiots poisoning themselves for someone else&#39;s profit. The profiteers buy and sell politicians and lie about the effects of their products all the time, in plain sight.</p>

<p>Instead...hateful people co-opt the fearful and we step closer and closer to lynchings and pogroms. Because where does it end? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, let me make it clear if it wasn&#39;t in my previous comment: I don&#39;t care how anyone chooses to define their gender or express themselves. People are people, whatever role they choose to play or masks they choose to wear I want them to be fulfilled, compassionate, and content. All the world&#39;s a stage and people merely players.</p>

<p>You asked for a scenario and I gave you what I believe is a plausible one based on my experiences with how corporations tend to work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t a thesis like that depend on the supposition that transgenders are a recent phenomenon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think so, the speculation I presented just requires that xenoestrogens effect reproductive and hormonal health negatively possibly with cumulative generational effects.</p>

<p>Personally, I suspect that most psychological divergence from norms and physical illness in western society are simply unintended consequences of our technology. But, you asked for a speculation that included intentional bad faith on the part of leadership.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There have always been people who have felt as if they were born the wrong sex and decided to live as the other. This isn&#39;t a new thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of assumptions here about our ability to understand other societies and the conception of the self in different (dead) cultures and languages. That being said I tentatively agree Feminine Men and Masculine Women do seem to have always been around and this seems to have expressed itself in different cultural ways.</p>

<p>In regards to everything else you posted: </p>

<p>I just want people to live with compassion for other people and to step up when they see people acting malevolently. I want people to act with awareness and not chase shiny things without considering and monitoring unintended consequences. I want people to experience nature and wonder in the beauty of it all. I want people to not fear death and live life courageously and well.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t get this abstract concept of gender at all or why people make a huge deal out of it.</p>

If that&#39;s what you experience, it&#39;s probably because that&#39;s what you put yourself into. </p>

<p>Get out and expand and find new people. There&#39;s plenty of people in their 20&#39;s who act like oldsters, and there&#39;s plenty of oldsters that act like they&#39;re still 20. </p>

<p>This blanket &quot;whoah is me my generation is ruined&quot; horse shit is annoying. Every generation thinks the previous one sucks, and every generation does stupid shit when they&#39;re figuring themselves out. Those old people you were talking to probably loved to talk about pop culture and tv when they were 20, but now it&#39;s so far beyond them that of course they wouldn&#39;t want to talk about it. </p>

<p>I’ve seen a lot of disheartening posts about “friends” on reddit in general. I’m beginning to think I’m blessed to know real people.</p>

<p>Every generation does this, every generation seems horrible to both the elders and the <em>outsiders</em> within that generation. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen texts from Ancient Rome where people in their 40s and 50s were complaining about the youth, their immature dalliances, the attention paid to stupid things, and how horrible they seem compared to better, greater generations. </p>

<p>This is a normal function of the passage of time as a human being. I assume you&#39;re young, because I used to feel the same way when I was young. And then something changed where I had matured and I had different friends, and I was able to talk about <em>real stuff</em> - my feelings, my fears, my goals and aspirations. </p>

<p>That you can admit this to yourself seems to me to be a good sign. </p>

<p>In Orwell&#39;s <em>1984</em> he speaks about this: children are turned against their parents by the state and by the telescreen. This is in the book, not so much the movie.</p>

<p>Parenting is only going to get more difficult and, let&#39;s be honest, most people are giving up, and letting the state and TV raise their kids for them.</p>

Don&#39;t believe that your child isn&#39;t welcomed by their peers, instead recognize that they just dont easilly fall into the trap that is cliques. You might be surprised to find out how many different people your child interacts with at school that maybe aren&#39;t being completelly registered as the friends that they are.

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking as one of the old people, I think you&#39;re on to something here.  Millenials have been subjected to relentless brainwashing from the moment they were born and have no perspective whatsoever on how thoroughly their attitudes and beliefs have been handed to them by the media.  </p>

<p>I, on the other hand, have only been subjected to relentless brainwashing for the last third of my life, and already had first-hand knowledge of many things that inoculated me from being seriously brainwashed.  Why?  Because I&#39;ve seen it for myself, so the lies have no power.</p>

<p>One of the biggest lies:  women in the 1960s were miserable being at home taking care of their husbands and families and just dying to spend their days in sterile cubicles working for a living.  Not!  Women were happier in the &quot;old days,&quot; families were happier, neighborhoods were happier.  We had tons of parties.  We spent lots of time face to face, not much time alone.  There were barbecues and badminton parties and croquet parties and pot lucks and progressive dinner parties.  Kids played outside all day, every day, in the summer time.  They came home tired and dirty and happy, slept like rocks and didn&#39;t need meds.</p>

<p>I could go on. We have been lied to about so many things.  Talk to your old people before they die, get it on tape, so future generations will know what we once had, and what we lost.  </p>

<p>Right, cuz the old people who make up the majority demographic of those watching CNN and Fox News all day, who grew up with only 3 TV channels, and one newspaper, and got their news only from Cronkite, really learned  how to critically think about their media consumption or belief system?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I think that in Huxley fashion, we are being molded by the media into something other than the natural state of humanity. Indeed we are changing what it means to be human. This is partly just a natural progress of resource, supply, and technology, but it is also in large part an concerted effort to reshape social order. Nature vs Societal construct is the core of progressive thought. Humans are social, physically active animals by nature. Both traits are disappearing, especially the social aspect.</p>

Everything else. My late 20 something and early 30 something year old friends have largely dropped off online. Like yeah a lot of people still have Facebook&#39;s but they&#39;re completely inactive.

It’s unfortunate that they’re are seemingly taking over, so you have to keep those intellectuals close to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know I agree and disagree. I find the latest trending memes funny and they can take up half of my vocabulary at times and I’ll take quite a few selfies but my friends and I also can delve into some really deep questioning of society and mock what we ourselves are partaking in. I think that there is a balance somewhere, but most of the population is at an unhealthy point now. My father in his late 40s texts and drives, and struggles to finish work because of Facebook. My stepmom will end up sitting in her car outside of the house for half an hour while I’ve cooked dinner and it’s getting cold because of a good game of “Candy Crush”.  It sucks when you want to actually talk about current events and they whip out their phones at the dinner table....</p>

<p>Right, cuz the old people who make up the majority demographic of those watching CNN and Fox News all day, who grew up with only 3 TV channels, and one newspaper, and got their news only from Cronkite, really learned  how to critically think about their media consumption or belief system?  </p>

<p>I know a few people in their 50s and 60s who used to hold very different opinions on topics like &#39;transexuals&#39; than they do today. What happened? Hours of exposure to TV and social media per day has fried their brains.</p>

<p>Alexander Inglis.</p>

<p>See his book here: <a href="https://archive.org/details/principlesofseco00ingliala">https://archive.org/details/principlesofseco00ingliala</a></p>

<p>See pages 368 and 377 specifically.</p>

<p>See the evidence that Harvard named their Lectureship in Secondary Schooling after Alexander Inglis here: <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1933/1/9/morrison-to-deliver-1933-inglis-lecture/">http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1933/1/9/morrison-to-deliver-1933-inglis-lecture/</a></p>

<p>Then connect the dots for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It actually quite literally his video... I think he made it or shills fir the guy who did.</p>

<p>He runs a site that charges $20+/mo, he exclusively shills his own videos. He tried to submit directly but that failed so he now tries to get subscribers this way. </p>

<p>His videos are nonsensical, often are based in a misapplication or lack of understanding of basic science concepts and his videos mainly promise to blow your mind if you subscribe to his site. He makes fun of “normies” (non woke people) and “conspiritards” (people on this Reddit). </p>

<p>He argues by moving goal posts, condescending towards those he debates, and ignoring your points and try to exploit areas where he demands impossible evidence (although his own theories seem to be based in nothing).</p>
