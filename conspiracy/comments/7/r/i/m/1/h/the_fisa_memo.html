<p>I hope they do release it. However I am going to put no stock into what any politician says about it while it’s still not released.  Too often are we told that some super shocking, world changing document is going to come out and everything will change. Then if it does get released, it rarely holds up to the hype about it. I call this classified blue balls. </p>

<p>So until something actually comes out with evidence, I don’t give a damn about what any politician says about it. It’s just political theater. They can say it’s the worst thing ever and sell it as so so long as it never comes out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Like I used to get hyped over things like this. Now it feels like they do it just to get people angry and more ingrained into the left vs right tribalism. Even this community is falling victim to it.  Look how many people are posting about literally nothing. There has been nothing shown. All we have so far are tweets from a few members of Congress saying it’s bad. Last time I checked, Congress members lie like hell to people. 
If we look at who has said it’s the worst thing ever, they tend to be on the far right and want to keep their base angry so they keep voting for them. </p>

<p>And before anyone says anything, I am fully aware that the left does this too. They hype up docs that either don’t live up to the hype or weren’t really important at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So take Steve King for example. He believes that immigration should be barred for pretty much anyone who isn’t a white European. He’s proposed laws that put Christianity as the law of the land so to speak by wanting to ban abortions and gay marriage. His policies are typically considered to be on the much more “conservative” side. </p>

<p>Another posting has come from Mark Meadows who believes that the government shouldn’t function. (He hasn’t actually said this I’m just making that assumption based on his demands during past budgeting debates and on the pleasure he seems to take from forcing government to stop funding anything really). </p>

<p>It’s these types of people who are i mean when I said far right. Their policies tend to be on the more right side of the spectrum </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’d say when opposition to them is based on solely on religion and the desires to prevent others from doing things because of your religion, that’s more on the far end of a political spectrum. </p>

<p>Use a medical description for how abortion is murder. No religious views on it. It doesn’t hold up. The only objection to abortion is that life starts at conception and that is a religious believe. We don’t make laws based on religious believes. </p>

<p>As for the argument that gay marriage leads to sexualization of children and normalizes pedophilia is completely ridiculous and not supported by evidence. (Not sure if you’re aware but pedophiles aren’t always gay, nor even the majority of them so that claim doesn’t really hold any reality either)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LMAO BYE Generation Z has been flooded with talks of sexuality in their childhood because of the gay agenda. I&#39;m not against abortion and gay marriage for any religious reason. Its simply just not good ideas. We need to improve adoption and foster care systems so no baby needs to be murdered to protect the mother&#39;s well being. We need to stop with all the talk of sexuality in children so kids stop having sex. I&#39;m interested in how things will affect our country in 10 years, not immediately. I&#39;m interested in the well-being of children. Abortion and the lgbtqiiaappxyz agenda damage society, culture, and the futures of our children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My generation was promiscuous and unhappy. Abortion showed us children can be discarded and the world is hopeless. Lgbtqqiiaappxyz agenda made kids start thinking about sex way younger. Who they would like to have sex with, their sexuality, etc. We struggled with self harm, premature sexual activity, depression, anxiety. Abortion and the Lgbtqqiiaappxyz movement played a major role in creating the most miserable, mentally ill, confused generation yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I haven’t noticed the same thing. I’ve heard a lot about it, but never witnessed it firsthand. For example, I’ve never actually seen a “safe space” either.</p>

<p>Did you have any trans kids at your high school? Or a large gay community?</p>

<p>Also, have you considered that people aren’t really changing and rather they are only now feeling comfortable to come out, where before they would have kept these things to themselves? Kinda like the sexual harassment situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My best friend in middle school came out to me. I was bisexual for a long time. My sister is the biggest dyke you could ever meet. I had less straight friends than gay ones. Not too many trannies though, but loads of &quot;non binaries&quot;. I dont think theres an epidemic of gay kids. There IS an epidemic of kids engaging in sexuality at younger and younger ages. There IS an epidemic of kids growing up much too fast. Middle schoolers act like high schoolers. Highschoolers act like college kids. So we have kids from 10-14 experimenting with sex or straight up engaging in it. You have 15-18 year olds sleeping around like nobody&#39;s business. Children should not be behaving this way and it is not natural or healthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Abortion is muder, gay marriage has lead to the sexualization of children and the normalization of pedophilia. These things are awful for the children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Abortion is sane policy. Banning it outright is tantamount to joining the Taliban. You want to force additional generations of unwed mothers, lifetime welfare state recipients in the form of down syndrome and retarded children and incest babies - not to mention plain old unwanted children, who comprise most sociopaths, psychopaths and criminality in society. How can any sane person look at the <em>effect</em> of abortion bans and say &quot;Yeah, I want my society to look like that, because Jesus.&quot;</p>

<p>The sexualization of children was well under way before the gays started wanting to get put two grooms on a fucking cake and pedophiles run every government on Earth and have for recorded history. </p>

<p>Look around at the actual children of immigrants and their history in the US. Irish, Italian, Eastern European, Syrian, Sikh, Chinese, Japanese, Indian. All these communities are integrated, own houses, work jobs, value education, have a major stake in society. And all these communities were once demonized by American society in the way modern migrants are now. If you think this is not true it&#39;s because you dwell in a basement and never meet any of these people in day-to-day life. your baseline ignorance is appalling, and belongs on /pol, not reddit.</p>

Unfortunately more likely is them yelling for it to be released despite them having all of the power, and blaming democrats if it isn&#39;t released.

Just because I go into a Q thread and read and participate like it is real, doesn&#39;t mean I think it is real at all. It just means I enjoy suspending disbelief and participating in the discussion. I don&#39;t know why people get so bent about subjects they don&#39;t find interesting or believe at all. You may think chemtrails are totally real and killing everyone, but I don&#39;t. I am not even particularly interested. So, I just don&#39;t get involved in those threads. It ain&#39;t hard.

This sub has been going nuts acting like some tweets from a couple of members of Congress is unearthing the holy grail. We have seen absolutely nothing so far.

<p>If Nancy Pelosi came out and said “oh I’ve seen something that will bring trump down”, would you believe her at face value or would you want to see the evidence before claiming she’s right? Cause that’s what this sub has been doing with the memo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the right approach for someone who hasn&#39;t deep dived on this story yet, for sure. </p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, however, most of what is in the memo has already been alluded to by Nunes and others. There&#39;s a lot out there to suggest to me that the Obama Administration was, at the very highest levels, conducting an espionage campaign against their political rival in a Presidential election. </p>

<p>Say what you want about Nunes and co., but the fact that <em>any</em> Congressman, <em>much less</em> the head of the Intelligence committee, seems to be making such a huge deal about this memo says a lot in my opinion: either Nunes is a hopeless, cynical partisan making a last-ditch effort to keep Mueller at bay by abusing his position or we are witnessing the unfolding of one of the largest political scandals in American history. Or both, frankly. </p>

<p>Do you believe this and then not believe that the Trump campaign/GOP was colluding with Russia?</p>

<p>I can entertain Obama admin were illegally spying (although I doubt it&#39;s illegal with the FISA reauthorization) but not if it&#39;s an attempt to derail the Mueller investigation.  Two separate investigations?  Sure have at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s possible that Trump has had legally and morally scrupulous dealings in the past with Russian oligarchs in his real estate business, but so far I&#39;ve seen no compelling evidence that would even tend to suggest that Trump knowingly colluded with a foreign power to subvert the electoral process. I am not saying it didn&#39;t happen - I certainly think it&#39;s possible - but in my opinion the fact pattern surrounding the Russian collusion story, from the FISA warrants to the Mueller investigation, is more consistent with a coup attempt to depose a sitting President of the United States.</p>

<p>Trust me, it&#39;s hard to actually write that out. But that&#39;s what it looks like to me.</p>

<p>There seems to be a very clear pattern surrounding this case of FBI agents/DOJ being thoroughly compromised by elements within the DNC/Clinton campaign. For example, Andrew McCabe&#39;s wife received $500,000 or more in campaign donations for a relatively unimportant state level election from a close Clinton confidant. Another example is Peter Strzok, who referred to an &quot;insurance policy&quot; in the event that Trump won the Presidency. He also spoke of a meeting with &quot;Andy&quot; (referring to Andrew McCabe) where they supposedly discussed this insurance policy. What the fuck was he talking about? A third example is Bruce Ohr, whose wife worked for Fusion GPS around the time they would have been working on the Dossier. Add to all of the above clear partisanship at the very highest echelons of the DoJ such as Lynch&#39;s tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton (what the fuck was that about?) and - at least to me - it becomes rather obvious that the entire Justice Department and FBI were compromised at the very highest levels. That Mueller then hired on Strzok to help work on the probe does absolutely nothing to assuage my concerns. I think when you really start to delve into the details the Russia collusion story falls apart.</p>

<p>Sorry for the TL:DR</p>

<p>What suggests that? I&#39;ve seen no evidence to suggest any of that - no evidence that Trump was monitored, no evidence that Obama had anything to do with surveillance, and no evidence that any secretly obtained information was used against Trump in the election.</p>

<p>Details about persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting. Third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked. And forth and finally, I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia, or the investigation of Russian activities, or of the Trump team. The House Intelligence Committee will thoroughly investigate the surveillance, and its subsequent dissemination, to determine, a few things here that I want to read off:</p>

<p>Nunes: Uh, we don’t know that yet, that’s why we need to get the information. I will say this, the NSA has been very, very helpful. They know how important these programs are, they are in constant communication with our team, and as you know they partially complied with our request last week, and I expect them to hopefully get more information by Friday. And I have spoke to Admiral Rogers about these concerns, and he wants to comply as quickly as he can.</p>

<p>Reporter: And was the president also part of that incidental collection?</p>

<p>Susan E. Rice reportedly sought to unmask the identities of Americans connected with President Trump&#39;s campaign and transition who were mentioned in foreign surveillance intelligence reports. And with that news, which was first reported Sunday by conservative social-media agitator Mike Cernovich and confirmed Monday by Bloomberg&#39;s Eli Lake, Washington spawned a huge game of Choose Your Own Adventure.</p>

<p>All this is highly unusual — and troubling. Unmasking does occur, but it is typically done by intelligence or law-enforcement officials engaged in anti-terror or espionage investigations. Ms. Rice would have had no obvious need to unmask Trump campaign officials other than political curiosity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your evidence for wrongdoing is that Nunes claims that there was some kind of <em>excessive</em> surveillance of the Trump transition. Firstly, let me point out that your original claim was about espionage in a presidential election. The transition is obviously after the election. So you&#39;ve still presented no evidence at all for your original claim. </p>

<p>But let&#39;s move the goalposts for you and pretend this is about the transition. The basis of the complaint is some documents that the White House fed to Nunes, way back in March of 2017. And what happened after that? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>After a review of the same intelligence reports brought to light by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers and aides have so far found no evidence that Obama administration officials did anything unusual or illegal, multiple sources in both parties tell CNN.</p>

<p>One congressional intelligence source described the requests made by Rice as &quot;normal and appropriate&quot; for officials who serve in that role to the president.</p>

<p>And another source said there&#39;s &quot;absolutely&quot; no smoking gun in the reports, urging the White House to declassify them to make clear there was nothing alarming in the documents.</p>

<p>So... nothing. Nothing happened after that. No criminal wrongdoing was found, and no evidence to even believe that anyone may have done anything wrong has arisen. The end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Devin Nunes wrote the memo based on reports about FISA warrants and such.  Basically the Republicans are saying that according to the memo the previous administration abused the FISA system to spy on Trump, or at least that is the theory of what is in it as no one has really seen it yet besides congress.  The Democrats who don&#39;t want it released are saying Nunes cherry picked info and left out context to make it seem that way.  </p>

<p>I personally feel that Nunes is, to put it bluntly, firmly in Trump&#39;s corner.  I don&#39;t think just the memo should be released.  I think the reports it is based on should be released with it so we can see who is doing the spin here.  The other problem I personally have with this is that the Republicans who are calling it worse than Watergate and such don&#39;t have access to the reports it is based on, so all they are going off of are what Nunes put into the memo.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but it is just how our system is set up.  It is compounded by our politicians feeding the flames of the turmoil it can cause so they get votes for themselves.  Additionally a lot of our voters are single issue voters, like abortion for instance.  Republicans run as anti-abortion, even though everything they do raises abortion rates but I digress, so regardless of what other issues harm a Republican voter because of Republican policies they will still vote for them because of the abortion policy Repubs run on.  Dems have the same things too.  We are a hot mess.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the impression the memo is very editorialized by the Republicans running the committee. The Democrats aren&#39;t going to vote to release it because they would basically be endorsing the memo. This is very different from releasing the transcript of a testimony.</p>

<p>I&#39;m expecting the Republicans will unilaterally release it eventually, but they&#39;re doing some marketing currently. They&#39;re establishing it as a damning memo that Democrats don&#39;t want you to see.</p>

<p>The memo itself will be pretty pointless because it&#39;ll be a partisan interpretation of evidence that we can&#39;t see. Trump defenders will play it up and then freak out that others aren&#39;t giving it enough attention. The memo itself will have about the same value as an editorial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only have a vague idea of what this memo business is about and am wondering why it&#39;s dominating the whole front page of conspiracy. My gut says it&#39;s another big nothing burger, just grandstanding. The cynical part of me says nothing will come of it, haven&#39;t we seen this so many times before? You want change, change yourself first. Stop waiting for stupid fucking memos from your puppet masters... /grumpy </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the people calling for the release of this memo actually believed that there was criminal wrongdoing they would be calling for the release of the actual FISA application, not a memo based on a report on the application. It is a distraction being pushed by bots and partisans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s hype for some simple reasons. This memo names names. Why would career pols write a memo with such serious allegations that literally name people if they aren&#39;t 100 percent positive. That opens them up personally to huge lawsuits and the end of their careers. Thats one thing.</p>

<p>Another thing is this memo is written from docs DOJ and FBI have been dragging their feet in since August. Nunes got so pissed with them, he threatened to hold them in contempt if they didn&#39;t hand them over. Wray and Rosenstein were so paniced when they deadline came close that they went to Paul Ryan&#39;s office to beg to still not to hand them over. But Ryan wae backing Nunes amd would up hold contempt of congress charges. That is where the memo comes from. Why the hell do people work that hard to conceal something? Also the repubs habe no problem releasing the docs they wrote the memo from. They want the memo amd the evidence out there.</p>

<p>Third,  stupid Evelyn Farkas all but confirmed on national TV that Obama was spying on the trump campaign and trying to get to the info to the hill. She is soooooo stupid.</p>

<p>Fourth, the FBI director and Rosenstein never flat out say to congress that dossier was never used to gey FISA warrants. Why not just say No. That would literally end it, but they can&#39;t bc they did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Don&#39;t Putin a President&quot;</p>

<p>Why are we twisting the meaning of an independent counsel?</p>

<p>Robert Mueller, a registered Republican, has the reputation of having unwavering morality and being experienced, fair, responsible, tight-lipped, and dutiful. There won’t be trumped up charges or fabricated evidence if there is nothing there. The innocent will go free. Let the investigation run its course without any hullabaloo or character assassinations. Anyone that believes external forces have backed off bots or intelligence gathering against America’s democracy, doesn’t live in truth.  </p>

<p>Before anyone jumps on the bandwagon that the FBI or the DOJ have gone rouge for political reasons, here are facts to better help you form opinions:</p>

<p>The Intelligence Committee chaired by Devin Nunes has lost focus on the concern of Russian intelligence and bots interfering with our past election or the cybersecurity interference from foreign adversaries. No legislation has been introduced to protect the independence of our voting process from foreign influence. Historically, America’s priority has been our concern with external attacks, both physical and intangible.
Devin Nunes, who served on Trump’s transition team, recused himself from the Russian investigation because of his furtive mishandling of classified information between the White House, yet continued to sign the committee’s subpoenas as chairman.

    <div class="md"><p>So take Steve King for example. He believes that immigration should be barred for pretty much anyone who isn’t a white European. He’s proposed laws that put Christianity as the law of the land so to speak by wanting to ban abortions and gay marriage. His policies are typically considered to be on the much more “conservative” side. </p>

<p>Another posting has come from Mark Meadows who believes that the government shouldn’t function. (He hasn’t actually said this I’m just making that assumption based on his demands during past budgeting debates and on the pleasure he seems to take from forcing government to stop funding anything really). </p>

<p>It’s these types of people who are i mean when I said far right. Their policies tend to be on the more right side of the spectrum </p>
