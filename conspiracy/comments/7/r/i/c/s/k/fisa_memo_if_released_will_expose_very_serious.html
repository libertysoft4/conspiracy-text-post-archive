<p>An educated guess by anyone who&#39;s been paying attention for the last year leads to the obvious conclusion that the report reveals extensive abuse of power and highly illegal collusion between the Obama administration, the FBI, the DOJ and the Clinton Campaign against Donald Trump and his team during and after the 2016 presidential election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny, I thought the FBI knew about the Russia story and said <em>nothing</em> until <em>after</em> the election. Meanwhile they were talking about Hillary&#39;s emails a couple of weeks before the election.</p>

<p>But yes, Obama and the DOJ were working with Hillary to publicly mention her email scandal while hiding any suspicion that Trump was working with the Russians until <em>after</em> the election.</p>

<p>Seems legit. /s</p>

<p>Also, Manafort/Gates indictments along with Papadapolous/Flynn guilty pleas who are now directly working with the special counsel, yet this is all just propaganda? We&#39;ve also gone from &quot;no one in my campaign ever met with any russians&quot; to &quot;well most of my campaign including my son and son-in-law met with russians multiple times but don&#39;t worry it was just about adoptions.&quot; Why the lies from the beginning if nothing nefarious happened?</p>

<p>Yes.  Trump did nothing with Russia that wasn&#39;t common practise.  We know ffrom the that the whole Red Scare 2.0 attack was planned out by the Hillary campaign when it became clear that their pied piper candidate actually had a chance.</p>

<p>Trump absolutely is guilty of criminal collusion with America&#39;s enemies though.  It&#39;s just that those enemies are Israel and Saudi Arabia, not Russia.</p>

Just because many of them are corrupt criminals, <em>does not mean</em> that everyone is. If you believe that Trump is just the same, then congratulations, you have been played by this group.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gerald Ford also altered the location of the entry wound in Kennedy’s back so that the path of the bullet would match up with the Commissions invention of “the single bullet theory”. The Commission knew how many seconds it took to fire the rifle that was found in the school book depository, and claimed only three shots were fired.<a href="http://www.covertbookreport.com/gerald-fords-big-kennedy-assassination-lie/">http://www.covertbookreport.com/gerald-fords-big-kennedy-assassination-lie/</a></p>

<p>TLDR:   Pence was acting on the outside to help the 9/11 Cover Up &quot;Investigation&quot;.    Mueller was acting on the inside to blow the investigation into the 9/11 Anthrax fiasco.    There are dozens more Pence&#39;s and Muellers where they came from who will straight face lie to the American people to recover from this unfolding Civil War between the Hillary loyalists and Trump loyalists where Russia,  FISA,  the Steele Dossier and everything else,  which should be serious matters properly addressed,  but instead seem to be nothing but footballs in a game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude!    And miss an opportunity to let the news agenda do its magic on the hypnotized mass while behind the scenes,   something more serious and sinister can be affected,   like cutting deals with banks to let them slide on corruption charges?    Come,   on,   be a sport,  lets draw this out and maybe we can get Trump to tweet something stupid about it that takes the focus elsewhere.    Headline:  &quot;Trump wants to revoke Mueller&#39;s Civil Rights&quot;   or &quot;Trump told Prostitute that he had the Clinton&#39;s by the balls,   but wanted to drag it out over his entire first term&quot;   or &quot;Reality TV Script found for Trumps entire first 4 years&quot;   (and the first year has already eaten up all the material for the first three seasons!!!)   Trump seeking screenwriters to extend his presidential reality show!!!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the reporting suggesting bias is based on the word of Congressional Republicans, who sometimes selectively leak information and sometimes outright lie. Typically, the cycle is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Republican leaks a claim that non-public information says something. Meanwhile, they try to keep all the details under wraps.</li>
<li>The conservative media runs with the story for a while.  <strong>← We are here</strong></li>
<li>The mainstream media runs with the story for a while.</li>
<li><em>More</em> non-public information is leaked that disproves the original claim.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Strzok was bounced from Mueller &quot;probe&quot; due to his many biased (and in the end illegal) statements to Lisa Page (and she was removed also). The most worrying might be his insurance statement against Trump. It is not the FBI&#39;s job to determine the President. They were weaponized. This might be treason.</p>

<p>Obama was the top of the Executive Branch. Of course he knew about this (but most likely was an orchestrator). The number of crimes Obama has committed in this whole coverup are a many. Honestly, he might be going to jail or worse if convicted for Treason (Where did those hundreds of billions that were flown in on jets to Iran end up?) Where did the Uranium 1 uranium end up in the world? This is looking very bad for him.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t create an investigation before the crime. The FISA warrant was finally issued with the fake data in the Russian Dossier. They were refused a FISA warrant on Trump prior (though it looks like they were already spying on him and had to get that warrant to make it look legit.) So, the DNC/Hillary and likely the FBI, helped FUND and CREATE the Russian Dossier. People are going to hang for this.</p>

<p>I would love to read that article. (I just hope it is sourced and and sauced.)</p>

<p>The Uranium 1 deal was improper because it appears to try to skirt the provision of the deal which made export out of the country forbidden. They tried to get around that by having the trucking companies license, be their &quot;out&quot;. (Their are also moral issues of course). Once that Uranium left America (to Canada) we know it went to Europe, but then? Iran? N. Korea? etc. You do understand that Uranium has a signature and if a bomb goes off we/they can track its country of origin. But if Obama sold our Uranium, with the intention of supplying a terrorist org/power with our Uranium, that could be like a setup. (Just one interpretation of course.) So, a this end, it is treason, punishable by death. A bigger question - Why do you not care about America selling Uranium, which can be obviously made into weapons, outside the country, much less to Russia (You know, that Country they are continually trying to connect Trump to.) Can you imagine if Trump sold Uranium to Russia, this would be over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to pretend that both parties are buying and selling bullshit but that&#39;s not true.  Republicans have been playing dirty politics for years, look at the Benghazi investigation.  You have a president tweeting lies and the whole rightwing media circling around to find some way, any way, that they can say he there&#39;s an inkling of truth.  The right has something the left doesn&#39;t have, a giant propaganda arm that is willing to defend each any everything they do.  I know people on this sub like to equate CNN with Fox News but it&#39;s not even close.  Do you know how many articles were put out by the &quot;liberal&quot; media telling me why I needed to listen to Trump voters economic concerns?  Do you think Fox News was telling anyone to listen to liberals?  It&#39;s a joke to pretend that the two parties are cut from the same cloth.  It&#39;s an easy view to take, it makes you feel cynical and smart, but it is not based in reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont remember much about Bengazhi, other than that it was showed that the democrats were deliberately lying about what happened.  They said it was a demonstration because of a movie made about islam. This demonstration only happened in the heads of democrats and never took place in reality.  Thats a strange thing to lie about. Even if it was true, so what? Is it acceptable for democrats that we begin murder each other over youtube videos?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Really? Another way to see it, is that the msm go into sleepmode every time a democrat is in the white house, and becomes rapid, wild dogs as soon a republican enters.</p>

<p>I can agree that fox might be a little more biased historically, (I doubt this is the case anymore after Trump won)  but they kinda have to be. They are playing a game of &quot;1 against 10&quot;, as the only big news corp supporting republicans, while the rest are democrats. Why would republicans listen to the MSM when they just stop critical reporting all together  as soon as a democrat enters the white house, and literally becomes a flock of hungry hyenas when a republican enters?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Don&#39;t Putin a President&quot;</p>

<p>Why are we twisting the meaning of an independent counsel?</p>

<p>Robert Mueller, a registered Republican, has the reputation of having unwavering morality and being experienced, fair, responsible, tight-lipped, and dutiful. There won’t be trumped up charges or fabricated evidence if there is nothing there. The innocent will go free. Let the investigation run its course without any hullabaloo or character assassinations. Anyone that believes external forces have backed off bots or intelligence gathering against America’s democracy, doesn’t live in truth.  </p>

<p>Before anyone jumps on the bandwagon that the FBI or the DOJ have gone rouge for political reasons, here are facts to better help you form opinions:</p>

<p>The Intelligence Committee chaired by Devin Nunes has lost focus on the concern of Russian intelligence and bots interfering with our past election or the cybersecurity interference from foreign adversaries. No legislation has been introduced to protect the independence of our voting process from foreign influence. Historically, America’s priority has been our concern with external attacks, both physical and intangible.
Devin Nunes, who served on Trump’s transition team, recused himself from the Russian investigation because of his furtive mishandling of classified information between the White House, yet continued to sign the committee’s subpoenas as chairman.
