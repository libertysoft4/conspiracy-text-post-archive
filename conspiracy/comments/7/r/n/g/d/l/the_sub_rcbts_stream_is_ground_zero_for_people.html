        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A series of phony anons who speak in coded language and make vague predictions and giving positive PR to trump, a staged election, and the crafting of an &quot;anti establishment image&quot; for their most recent puppet, have merged a fair amount of conspiracy theorists with conservative politics and trust for Donald Trump as an &quot;outsider&quot;. The gatekeepers like Alex Jones and PJW abandoned their platforms of once criticizing the two party system and the presidential candidates, and have sold out in support of purely Republican ideology. </p>

<p>Most of us have remained skeptical and continue to embrace our non partisan appeal, but how do we reach these people who are susceptible to this large scale psyop ? </p>

<p>Trump is merely playing an anti establishment character. He was likely selected to do this by the social engineers, who staged the &quot;good cop bad cop&quot; election. </p>

<p>We need to find a way to reestablish our non partisan appeal once again so we can reach a wider variety of people. Currently, this sub is starting to slowly creep back in the direction of a pro trump/conservative Leaning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Obama was president, skepticism toward intelligence agencies like the NSA and FBI, talk of dirty tricks and the like was not something that really divided people along party lines.  Somehow these days it seems to be that talking about these people, the so-called ‘deep state’ is a very partisan thing.  One side believes every cryptic conspiracy and the other side honestly believes that even entertaining the thought means you’re somehow connected to Russia or under their influence.  The very nature of these shadowy figures has always fallen under the ‘conspiracy’ category.  I think part of the issue is that the political climate has changed, not that the sub changed.  Trump is seen by his opponents as more of an openly fascist loud mouth idiot than he is a secret plotter.  His supporters see their opponents as the shadowy deep state working to undermine everything they support.  I think it’s hard to separate ‘conspiracy’ from partisanship at the current moment.  It’s certainly not good for this sub and what it has traditionally stood for, but I think it’ll be difficult to change until the “trump vs deep state” obsession subsides and we get back to more normal times.  Just my opinion.</p>

<p>As for bipartisanship I am neither republican or dem. I am a constitutionalist. I think many of us are. The Dem party has been subverted by the authoritarian “left”. The type in California that says if you abide by federal immigration laws you can be fined 10k. </p>

<p>The republicans are little more that Dem light. I honor the constitution. It’s worked for centuries. At present I believe Q is an individual(s) who is (are) dedicated to an America first, constitution first agenda, and the info he or they have leaked in the past, repeatedly verified in time, nears that out. I’m willing to keep an open mind, but if you don’t like it here, why are you here at all?</p>
