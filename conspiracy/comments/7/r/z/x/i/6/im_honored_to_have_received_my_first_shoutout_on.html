<p>We’ve irrevocably disrupted their ecosystem, I don’t believe it will ever recover from the recent hyperinflation of stupidity. Peak Top. Mind. is a myth. We turned u/RecoveringGrace into a CBTS dipshit, and u/zenmasterzen3 was always a few letters short of a complete alphabet (because of the Jewish copyright cartel) but now some of his insanity is dedicated to us.</p>

<p>Oh well…</p>

<p><em>Hey TMOR. You guys know anyone can post on Reddit right? So you could be making fun of a 12 year old. Kinda pathetic don&#39;t you think?</em></p>

<p><em>Dear TMOR,</em></p>

<p><em>Anybody can post to Reddit. Are you guys making fun of children? Doesn&#39;t seem like much of a sport to me.</em></p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell if u/The_In-Betweener is telling us his age, the age of his fellow Top Minds, or his age preference. Really weird comments to make. I guess that if any Top Mind can prove that they’re a minor we’ll pass the case file on to r/im14andthisisdeep.</p>

<p>Edit: Okay this is weirder still.</p>

<p><em>&quot;The legal Age of Consent varies from 11 to 21 years old from country to country around the world. In some countries, there is no legal age of consent but all sexual relations are forbidden outside of marriage. &quot; -<a href="https://www.ageofconsent.net/world">https://www.ageofconsent.net/world</a></em></p>

<p><em>Should there be a universal age of consent. What should it be? Any child psychologists in the house? I think South Park said it should be 17. Does mental maturity trump biological maturity?</em></p>

<p><em>Do I sound like a pedophile right now? Hi TMOR!</em></p>

<p>You do now!</p>

<p>Good thing parents are responsible for what their children interface with so we don&#39;t need to use the &quot;protect the children&quot; narrative to censor whatever is deemed &quot;dangerous for consumption&quot; by whoever decides they are fit for this role.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t see how this is anti free speech. Good thing parents are, for the most part, already monitoring their children’s internet activity. And for those kids who are old or mature enough to be autonomous, they can decide for themselves if their time might be better spent getting a girlfriend or taking up a hobby that might actually make them some money or something.</p>

<p>I just feel bad for any kid who makes “conspiracies their thing” when they could be learning a useful skill or making new (irl) friends.</p>
