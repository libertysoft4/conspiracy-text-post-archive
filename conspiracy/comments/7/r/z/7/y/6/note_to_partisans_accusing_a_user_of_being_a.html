<p>(by that I mean accusing someone of being an anti-semite just because they criticized the government of israel)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m Jewish and I think that criticism of Israel is welcome, but the overwhelming majority of such criticism is dripping with antisemitism that only comes to the front after a few comments are coaxed out of the poster. On this subreddit in particular it strongly feels that criticism of Israel is primarily based in antisemitism, not genuine critique of their government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more accurately termed ethnic cleansing. And if you want to use numbers, Israel&#39;s attacks on Palestine have been nothing short of one-sided massacres against a defenseless people. This is as close to genocide as you can get. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting, because the Palestinian charter calls destruction of Israel as a founding principle. It&#39;s in writing, and since Iran really runs Palestine through their surrogate Hamas, that&#39;s unlikely to change, since it&#39;s Iran&#39;s stated policy as well. Show me where that&#39;s reciprocated in Israeli doctrine. Nevermind, you can&#39;t. </p>

<p>It&#39;s unfortunate for Palestine that Iran and other regional players use them this way. They&#39;re really just a pawn and a convenient political wedge Islamists use to indoctrinate idealistic college sophomores and religious mothers who think a bomb vest will get their child into heaven. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not Israel&#39;s fault that fighting a multi generational conflict on several fronts has made them, out of necessity, better than their neighbors at security and warfare. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how old you are, but I remember when Palestinians were detonating bombs on buses and busy cafés. They were effective in terrorism. In response the Israelis erected checkpoints. Plane and ship hijackings led to the best port and customs security on the globe. When the rocket attacks came, they built the Iron Dome. Now the Palestinians are reduced to random stabbings, but Israel has built a very effective wall, so there are increasingly fewer insurgents able to penetrate their defenses. </p>

<p>Israel cannot afford to take their security lightly. When they are hit, they hit back harder. The bloodied aggressor then says it&#39;s not fair, but they never seem to learn their lesson. So they probe and try another angle, and Israel puts more security controls in place, to cries of oppression. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a farce. The truth is, if Palestine and the regional players, like Iran, who work through Palestine were better than Israel at espionage, security, and warfare, there would be no Israel. </p>

<p>And yes, Israel receives a lot of fiscal and intelligence help from the USA, but until the day come when Israel is not an island of stable democracy in a sea of warlords and theocrats, that&#39;s unlikely to change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Likud party themselves were terrorists. I don&#39;t know how old you are, but I remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_war_beach_bombing_incidents">bombings againt defenseless children</a> in Gaza. </p>

<p>Pretty much everything you&#39;re saying is one-sided Israeli propaganda where obviously very little research was done regarding the war crimes, destruction, massacres, etc. were done against Palestine. But that doesn&#39;t shock me since it&#39;s the norm for antisemites to dehumanize the Palestinians just like this &#39;oh well they deserve it!&#39;</p>

<p>But seriously, get real. Everything I said in my previous post is true. Palestine is the aggressor, and they suffer for it. They should probably rethink their strategy of trying to wipe Israel off the map. Otherwise, as the saying goes, you mess with the bull, you get the horns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is funny, because the Saudis have aligned with Israel because they have a common enemy, Iran! The same Iran who is the leading state sponsor of terrorism. And who does that state sponsor of terror work through as a base of operations to attack Israel? Palestine! </p>

<p>That&#39;s neither an exoneration of Saudi Arabia, nor an indictment of Israel. If Israel ever starts behaving like the Saudis, you better believe I&#39;ll condemn it. I certainly am dubious of the partnership, but maybe it will help the Saudis grow up and get out of the dark ages.</p>

<p><em>Wars</em> of defense are horrible, but justified. Israel has been more than tolerant of a thorn in its side, but missiles and mortars are not a valid form of protest, and international law (applied non-prejudicially) supports Israel&#39;s wars of defense. Rocket launchers on/in apartments and hospitals are against the Geneva Conventions for a reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using your logic, there shouldn&#39;t even be different subreddits.  Just one forum where every thread is fair game for partisan politics, pokemon, fishing, conspiracy theories, football, etc...because hey, if someone injects something about fishing into the thread you started about a conspiracy theory, you can just ignore them or better yet, take the time to explain to them how their post about fishing is doesn&#39;t make sense or is false.</p>

<p>r/republican is a place for Republicans, it says so right there on their front page</p>

<p>r/democrats is for Democrats</p>

<p>r/politics is for partisan politics regarding those same Republicans and Democrats</p>

<p>There is no good reason why the Republicans and Democrats should be allowed to annex r/conspiracy while they have plenty of places to go to wallow in their partisan theatre.</p>

You can not do that in a public forum that allows anyone with a computer and an Internet connection to participate. You&#39;re going to get trolls, shills, morons, and even people that just happen to disagree, and that&#39;s the price you pay for being able to talk to people from all over the world, from all kinds of different backgrounds. The more control you have the less participation. That&#39;s why I said you can write whatever you want on a blog, &quot;Bill Clinton is from Mars and btw, he is the Antichrist&quot; and then if someone starts talking about &quot;Melania Trump is a reptilian and eats babies,&quot; you can block that person. But you may not get as many views as you do on a popular subreddit on a very popular site. That&#39;s how it goes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm, I probably seem guilty of this. I criticize Democrats on this sub more often. But, it&#39;s not like I support Republicans or Trump. But when there are criticisms to be made about the Right, the front page of Reddit is already full of said criticism, I have nothing to ad. Criticizing Democrats is more difficult on this website, so that just ends up being what I feel the need to comment on.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are malicious users like you say, but it&#39;s also intellectually lazy to assume anyone who disagrees with you is malicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Progressive here.  It is undoubtedly the case that the Republicans are particularly messing things up right now.  But please note that the Democrats are also doing a terrible job.  </p>

<p>Note Chuck Schumer crowing over the fact that their budget proposal increases the US military budget by $80 billion more than even Trump asked for - that&#39;s enough to pay for free college for every student in the United States.  Note that the same Democrats who perpetually accuse Trump of being unhinged just voted to authorize essentially <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/01/17/these-18-senate-democrats-just-voted-hand-trump-mass-spying-powers">oversight-free warrantless spying by the executive branch</a>.</p>

<p>Eight years of Obama, and what did we get?  No bankers went to jail.  There wasn&#39;t even an investigation into how the American public got fed lies to bring them into the Iraq War.  Americans are still fighting and dying in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a whole bunch of new skirmishes and outright wars started, particularly the awful one in Libya.  I could go on and on - we needed a home run and we didn&#39;t even get a base hit.</p>

<p>I have to say that in my heart, I believed that Hillary Clinton would have moved to war with Russia almost recently, based on her own belligerent statements on the matter, and based on her long public record of &quot;never saw a war she didn&#39;t like&quot;.  For all the terrible things that Trump has done, a war between two nuclear powers would have been far worse.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s the point of #resisting Trump if we go back to another militarist, pro-Wall Street, anti-worker Democratic administration?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t a mistake that the successful (non-political) subs have <em>super</em> stringent rules about <em>no politics</em>, AT ALL. They remove anybody&#39;s comment or post that is partisan related. </p>

<p>Somebody (in a successful sub) will say: &quot;Well, my idiot dad who can&#39;t shut his mouth about the particular man in the white house&quot;.. etc. They get removed instantly, and for good reason. Every single discussion spawned from a comment referencing a <em>single</em> whiff of partisan politics devolves into a maniacal dialog between people you don&#39;t know or care about. It almost <em>never</em>, and I mean <em>nevvvvver</em> arrives at some conclusion. It&#39;s just walls and walls of bullshit, that for me is totally and 100% meaningless <em>to begin with</em>! And, unfortunately, the mods here do not care about policing this issue, which <em>kills</em> almost any other sub that allows it. In my opinion, it&#39;s really this simple: a new sub for PoliticsConspiracy must be created, and posted on the side bar, and the mods need to step up and clean house of <em>any</em> partisan-based threads, period, end of story.</p>

<p>These people can have their own sub to bitch back and forth at each other. I can guarantee most people who come here <em>do not give a fuck</em> about this endless L-R nonsense, and the bullshit that goes on that they claim is &quot;conspiracy&quot;, when it <em>isn&#39;t</em>. It&#39;s just fucking politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s obvious that you are a hil-bot trumpet demopublican. You are causing so much partisanship that you have morphed into a 4 dimensional tesseract of politics. An individual who hates both parties and supports both parties at the same time. I know it&#39;s hard for most people to wrap their heads around this because it&#39;s a 4 dimensional concept, but just trust me, you are the problem.  /s</p>

<p>I too am a moderate. I have my leanings on certain issues, but my overall view matches neither republican, Democrat, libertarian, neocon, neolib, green, etc etc. The moment I comment in support of an issue, I&#39;m immediately labeled. </p>

<p>The funny thing is that the first part of this comment is kinda true. Us moderates (for lack of a better term), or maybe we could be called &quot;independent thinkers&quot;, or maybe &quot;people who weigh the facts and form their own opinions on each issue&quot;, or maybe &quot;people who don&#39;t blindly follow politicians&quot;. Us moderates really are tesseracts. It sure seems like a lot of people can&#39;t understand how someone could support building a wall, but not be a Trumpet. Or how we could support universal healthcare and not be socialist, or how we can support DACA, but not be a libtard. (All of these are examples, they do not necessarily represent my views).</p>

<p>My point is the same as OP. PLEASE, do America a favor, consider each issue and form your own opinions. It&#39;s okay to agree with points made on each side. It&#39;s okay to admit that you&#39;re not sure what the best course of action is. It&#39;s okay to come up with a unique idea that no one has considered. Last, it&#39;s okay to not identify with any political party at all.</p>

<p>My belief is that there are a lot of power hungry, greedy people that love that we are all fighting about stupid little issues. They keep us stuck on these issues so we don&#39;t actually get to the real issues that can actually facilitate peace and wealth among the lower and middle class.</p>

<p>(I&#39;m prepared for people to immediately label me for what I just wrote, that&#39;s fine)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corruption is not a binary, it&#39;s a spectrum. Some people are more corrupt than others. The statement &quot;They&#39;re ALL corrupt&quot; is drawing a false equivalence between those who take money from special interests and offer relatively little in return vs those who are placed into positions of power by corporations they formerly worked for or those who are outright bought by foreign governments. &quot;They&#39;re all corrupt&quot; offers nothing to the conversation and steers genuine criticism away from those who deserve it. It paints the entire government the same color when it&#39;s actually dramatically distinct shades of grey.</p>

McCain sucks. we could go on and on for decades. <em>The people making the decisions in American politics</em> suck! </p>

<p>there are people with pussy hats and MAGA hats who ultimately have the same anger and resentment towards the state of the US. i will even go so far as to say that the ideologies of both antifa and the alt-right stem from the very same anger. </p>

<p>our politicians literally shut down our government because they can&#39;t make a damn agreement. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s because their partisan voting bases can&#39;t agree. I think we are better than that. I think that we, the people, have more in common than our leaders like to think.</p>

<p>we can do a better job at sitting down with our neighbors (whether in real life or cyberspace) and <em>dissecting</em> our differences in ideology. i guarantee the vast majority of us want comfort, safety, and most of all liberty--for ourselves and every fellow human being. the disagreements lie in our biases that the Big Guys built. we can&#39;t sit around arguing me versus you any longer.</p>
