He told a story about a book called Pimp - tldr version is that it’s about a pimp that does really fucked up and malicious shit to “break” his prostitute so she serves him..  he goes on to say “that’s how the game works folks” </p>

<p>All the main sites can talk about was that he was “transphobic”.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was totally cryptic man, the way he he said the “what if the rapes aren’t even the worst that’s going on” I knew right away he totally knows.. he just can’t straight up say it, he’s such a down to earth dude..he was talking about how now more than ever it’s important to talk reckless or his kids won’t know what free speech is. He’s absolutely right, and what these tabloid websites all got from it was he was transphobic.. god these people are so thick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think it was the cryptic, really. He turned down large sums of MONEY and walked away with his credibility/soul in tact. He didn&#39;t want to be bought like the prostitute was. He even said something to the effect about how his movie How High ended up being something he didn&#39;t want/expect it to be</p>

<p>Everyone that gets air time gets paid, and if they fit the buyers bill they can keep getting paid. We&#39;re just being curtailed to. Follow the money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what i took from it was he was on the precipice, people were trying to get him into those compromising situations in some way but he recognized how spooky it was. with the metaphor from the pimp book, i think it would be like if the girl, instead of calling the pimp when she thinks she has killed the guy (or maybe when the last job is so unusually sketchy), instead dips out completely and catches the first flight to africa. just my guess..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably about that programming program used on people, monarch. Where they traumatised people because that kind of abuse creates vulnerabilities and breaks people. Their soul is broken and weak and the person holding the so called leash USE PEOPLE. </p>

<p>Current relevant news: breaking and trendinf recently is a story about a family that had people handcuffed inside their house and they looked starved. </p>

<p>Begins the curtains things happen hard to fathom. People can be Controlled. There are many degrees to this. Most people can relate to the level of control where they&#39;ve seen it in family dynamics, bullying, blackmail, etc. Think of how small they start. How the littlest things influence another&#39;s behavior. How they can stack and build upon each other in amount , in degree,  in severity, extremity, in unimaginability, unspeakability...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very real possibility, he shrouds it all in comedy but if you&#39;ve seen some of his older stuff AFTER Chappelle Show ended, there are a few very telling videos out there, captured on small shows with cell phone cameras or whatever. He looks, acts and feels absolutely devastated when he starts talking about &quot;stuff&quot;, he NEVER mentions what it is, just dancing around it.

    <div class="md"><p>Two different points, the way I understand it. 1. We all know some directors and producers have parties with 13-15 year olds doing drugs. We have heard these stories a million times. Its weird none of them have come out with the #metoo stuff.</p>

<p>Second point: Chapelle hinted that he had a contract that said he was owed a certain percentage of what his show made. When it made way more than anyone expected they tried to buy him off with the 50 million. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I got out of it at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im in a social circle with friends that know Dave. Here’s what happened with Comedy Central. It’s a long story but to give some facts. The honchos at CC were threatened by Dave’s popularity and were concerned that Dave would either leave CC and/or start to use his comedy as a platform to influence his following on political/social matters. They first offered him to ghost write the scripts for Chappelle Show, which he declined. Then they wanted to modify the show and limit his creativity, he declined. Then they offered to buy him out of his contract. The offer was 10% of his gross Sales revenue of the show, which at the time was above $500 million. His contract stated royalties and 20% of direct sales of Chappelle merchandise, which at the time would include dvd Sales, syndication, all that had his name on it. CC honchos refused and black balled him from being involved in the show, while they racked up even more money. This was the third season when shit went south. They told him if he didn’t get in line with the program and take the offer, that he would never work again in Hollywood. This started the smear campaign and his departure to Africa to recover from the stress and find himself again. This is why the story of the pimp is told. The studio tried to break him, and right when he was down they tried to sweeten the deal by paying him $50m which seemed like a ton of money, but in reality was a fraction of what he was legally entitled. The sneaky bastards were able to smear his name to make it look like a breach of contract that he did drugs and was unstable, nullifying their offer and his potential earnings from the show. Similar to the prostitute who goes to deliver a message and realizes the guy is dead but in reality it’s all a hoax. They set him up from the start as soon as they had recovered their costs for the show. If he fell in line they would continue to make tons of money at a fraction of what they had to pay. If he didn’t they wouldn’t have to pay shit and still own all the rights. His lawyer fucked him to because they didn’t advise him on the clauses in his contract. There’s more to it, but that’s the gist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A distraction from what, though? They say any attention is good attention in showbiz because it puts you in the spotlight, so one would assume that once criticism started to come out people would be intrigued to see what the controversy is sbout and start watching the show. Unless putting the attention on Chappelle was an attempt to distract from something different and unrelated. But what, though? What happened right around that time? If, though it really was just criticism of a joke, why is that not allowed? It doesn&#39;t have to be a love it all or leave it all type thing and besides, I can&#39;t think of a single group who doesn&#39;t act offended and persecuted at times. Hell, the emotion in comments crying about white genocide or the disappearance of white folk on this site, you&#39;d think the commenter was the last of a handful of whites fearing for their liv3s. Relax Willy Whitebread, our skintone isn&#39;t disappearing. Everyone is a sensitive snowflake, now a days.</p>

He wouldn&#39;t dress as a woman for entertainment because they never ask white people to do this kind of stuff.

<p>It sounds like the other half is hinting towards them doing some unspecified fucked up blackmail shit. Which, if the story is true about them actually trying to keep $200 million owed to him, doesn&#39;t sound all that implausible, does it?</p>

Think about the story of the pimp and the hoe more closely. He made her think she murdered someone so that she would feel guilty and do more work for him. Does that sound like a story he would tell if they wanted him to do embarrasing jokes he didn’t want to do?</p>

<p>Shit, that&#39;s like Baby Driver, where the kid thinks once he&#39;s paid his debt, he&#39;s free, but then they threaten his girlfriend instead. And it&#39;s such pervasive leverage. If you have a conscience, you&#39;re not going to let your loved ones get hurt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, watched the Bird Revelation a few times now, will watch it a few more of course. Everyone on the internet seems to be missing the point. They think how we are all enslaved to the system etc is what Dave mean&#39;t. Are you fucking kidding me?</p>

<p>Dave is talking about some naaaaaaasty shit, what the fuck is worse than rape and shit? I think we should take Pimp story to heart, the whore was conned into thinking she&#39;d killed someone - THAT&#39;s how the Pimp got her mileage up. My opinion is that Dave left the country because he was asked to join in on some initiation shit which included pedophilia or killing or whatever, probably some of the worst shit you can imagine. And he bounced. I think that these elite motherfuckers probably though Dave could easily be swayed - nah-ah, bitches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s spoken to this a few times before this special. In interviews he basically said he didn&#39;t want to become Louis CK. You take $50 million dollars and then you have to do what you are told. This leads to censorship and a watered down finish product that you aren&#39;t proud of. So he walked away. Funny that once he walked main stream media portrayed him as crazy and had gone off his rocker because he wouldn&#39;t sell his soul to the industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other metaphor he alluded to was the end of apartheid in SA. To paraphrase Dave &quot;when an entire system is corrupt then the people who adhere to the system and are insentivised by the system are not criminals, they&#39;re victims, and that the system itself must be tried. And the only way to figure out what the system is is if everybody says what they did&quot;
He was using the story in the context of the sexual assault scandals in hollywood, but I think it applies as a metaphor to the industry as a whole. Especially how all the moving parts of &quot;the system&quot;, the media, government etc, all need to be visible. And the people who work for the system, support and idolise media, celebrities, politicians, are the victims, not criminals. It&#39;s not their fault the system is corrupt, they just need to be shown what the system really is for everyone to figure it out.</p>
