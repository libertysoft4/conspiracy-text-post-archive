    <div class="md"><p>As someone who believes in the possible energy manifestation through ritual and meditation, I will first say that I know NOTHING about the intricacies of blood magick. </p>

<p>Rituals take place during astronomical alignments. Electrical influences from the cosmos fine tune to specific frequencies, specific dimensions.. (stranger things, what dreams may come,) depending on which  deities a person chooses, their rituals may be light and jovial, cleansing the area for crop fertility, or for for enlightening and spiritual wisdom, it can also be much darker. </p>

<p>There are certain people who worship beings that resonate on a much lower frequency, and their demands are not small to prove devotion. </p>

<p>Most light and dark, approve of sex magick, for sex is the act of creation, a large energy transference and for the darker, very easily corruptible. Both sides approve of purity, and youth... The latter, again the corruption of it moreso. </p>

<p>To prove their faith, people for eons have offered up their young to these Gods. This is still happening. </p>

<p>Taking spirituality out of the equation, to speak frankly in scientific terms, young blood is the most nutrient rich, most virile and most wanted, it has rejuvenating qualities, ambrosiaplasma.com.  Adrenochrome is released into the bloodstream during heavy duress, it also has interesting psychoactive properties...<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenochrome">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenochrome</a></p>

<p>Tldr: the rituals are designed to get everyone vibrating on the same frequency, or feeling the mood if you will... While all deities typically demand sacrifice, and like sex, darker &quot;God&#39;s&quot; demand payment in young flesh, the release of chemicals into the victims bloodstream causes a high the group experiences, I.e. deluded enlightenment... Wash, rinse, repeat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. 
Very interesting, slightly terrifying. </p>

<p>I do wish that our culture didn’t frown upon the ritualistic use of hallucinogens. My husband had mentioned tripping as a way to “hard reset” himself and I’ve seen a lot more articles on studies for the same purpose (specifically using them in depression patients). Indigenous tribes do that, I know the 2 times I’ve tripped I felt more at peace and one with nature and had a greater appreciation for all living things. Maybe that’s what we all need. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is something to be said for psychedelics. I&#39;ve experienced a few substances myself and have come out happier and more aware each time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in dmt, by then I get nervous about it. </p>

<p>Speaking of tribes, and to lend modern credibility to the viability of cannibalism, BDSM, and torture; there are active cannibalistic tribes in Guinea as well as, (this.)

All of Christianity is based off of consuming the blood of God. Jesus was tortured, and some his present day followers participate in self-flagellation, specifically devout Catholics. </p>

<p>Another modern example, would be the complex art installations that are performed by own elite. Spirit cooking. Adrenochrome is the spirit molecule/frequency/chemical. They are located in the pineal gland, a piece of anatomy represented in both Egyptian hieroglyphs, AND the cloak surrounding God in da Vinci&#39;s &#39;Creation of Adam.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we are currently in a very low frequency &quot;realm&quot; and we&#39;re already pretty close to hell. I think every soul has its own journey and it starts in low places. I think our souls are here to grow. I believe both heaven and hell to be a state of mind so to say. Somebody who is always depressed, guilt ridden, and ashamed is in a &quot;hellish&quot; state. Somebody who vibrates at a much higher frequency is closer resonating with &quot;the light&quot; is more heavenly. I think where we end up after this life depends on the growth of our souls and the oneness we feel with god.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for replying. I have heard of that type of belief before but I haven&#39;t looked much into it. Your view on heaven and hell is quote intriguing. You mentioned that the growth of our souls decides where we end up so you think hell is a lake of fire or eternal torment like described in the major religions?</p>

<p>Also to add thanks for replying to my comments. I love hearing other people&#39;s opinions and beliefs so this type of stuff really interests me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem! We are in a time when people are being exposed to all kinds of world views they&#39;ve never explored before.</p>

<p>I believe there is no eternal damnation even if our souls are eternal. I think if a soul cannot grow during a lifetime it will become &quot;lost&quot; and will roam the astral of this low frequency realm until it is ready to ascend closer to god. But then again, there is so much I cannot know and won&#39;t know till the inevitable happens but I do think our minds are extremely powerful and have the capabilities to manifest our beliefs. I think religion has corrupted spirituality and instilled fear rather than promoting love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think as time goes on we become more open to other people&#39;s way of life, values and ideas so it allows new opinions about things like spirituality. Like if we were discussing this a hundred years ago we would be labeled heretics. I used to be a Christian and I was a pretty fundamental one. Now I am unsure of my beliefs so I like hearing as many viewpoints as possible.</p>

<p>I also totally agree that religions installing of fear and punishment helps no one</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for me, it started with internal reddit drama. in the early days, the subredditcancer sub didnt exist, i dont think undelete existed yet...so this sub was the go-to place for things like takeovers of subs, mod drama, shit related to admins, etc. reddit shit. there were some other subs dedicated to this, but they were already cancer, whereas conspiracy was pretty neutral about whatever was going on.</p>

<p>at the time, i think those were the biggest stories. this sub was pretty dead outside of that kind of shit. people would post flat earth shit or bigfoot and aliens or whatever, but no one really read it. people just stayed subbed because if there was some big reddit happenings, this was the place to read and talk about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like a large part of the conspiracy community is like minded as me, in a way that they don&#39;t let emotions distort their view on issues. After someone finding a conspiracy, finding evidence to support that theory. And the thrill that you are on to something.</p>

<p>However, I feel like allot of that has gone down the drain nowadays ,since most this sub talks about is politics and anything related to that.</p>

<p>Not that there is something wrong with a political conspiracy, like the 9/11 case or corruption in a government, but most of the stuff posted is just obvious trashtalking about Trump or Hillary. Not only does it distract, but it polarizes the community who used to work together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have obsessive compulsion disorder and when things got out of hand was highly encouraged to see a psychiatrist. I saw several when I was younger actually. I tried the antidepressants and other &quot;treatments&quot; they recommended, assuming them to be the responsible way to deal with my problems. I have a variety of health problems now, many of which I am very certain were caused by the psychiatric treatments I have agreed to (time-wise, they correlate almost precisely with certain treatments). I started reading about psychiatry and learned that a good deal, if not entirety, of what I was told was a complete lie. No &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; has ever been scientifically observed in anyone with mental illness. In fact, there is not even a proposed means by which one could attempt to measure such an imbalance. It&#39;s not even clear what &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; means. Imbalance of what specifically? How did it get imbalanced? How would you know if it was balanced? Why is it bad for this nebulous imbalance to occur?</p>

<p>Psychiatry is riddled with sophisms like the chemical imbalance &quot;theory&quot;; as well as terrible data for the drugs efficacy, and unequivocal evidence of outright fraud.</p>

<p>Despite all of this, everyone in my life continued to advocate that I see I psychiatrist. Not only did no one hold my same opinion that psychiatry was a sham. No one would even entertain the idea. No one had so much as googled &quot;criticisms of psychiatry&quot;. What I noticed starkly was a strange intractable bias among most of the people to believe, without any semblance at evidence, psychiatry was a good thing.</p>

<p>After experiencing this Orwellian rejection of reason so bluntly, I largely started to dismiss &quot;conventional wisdom&quot;. I came to the opinion that most people are delusionally biased towards believing certain ideas (the most common bias seems to be that the big institutions in their life cannot be corrupt - sure the government in Russia might be heinously corrupt, but the good ole&#39; USA could never be). I started reading/researching more and had much more of an open-mind to points of view I previously just assumed were crazy. That&#39;s kind of how I ended up interested in &quot;conspiracies&quot; (many of which seem to just be evidence that goes against people&#39;s dogmatic trust in institution) and eventually found this place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting write up thank you. I feel people here are more open to new ideas and not so rigid in their thinking.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to come out and say someone is better because they are more open minded or willing to try new things but I think it definitely helps in life.  </p>

<p>At work today I switched to a new plate that looks nicer than the old one for serving food.  And right away two main employees were pissed saying they hate change or that it will never work and the one would barely say anything to me.  I am their boss.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m merely trying the new plate out for two days to see if it works.  What a boring lame life not being open to change.  And why ruin your day over such a small thing like this.  Some people are crazy.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s their upbringing or what.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a similar story.  I did not care about politics until a friend mentioned Sanders to me.  Then I started paying attention and saw how he was getting screwed.  That raised quite a few questions, so I started researching politics more.  It led me to places I did not know existed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Russian bogeyman must scare you to death, huh? Be careful, Putin might be hiding under your pillow! Trump isn&#39;t a man of the People but he&#39;s also not a Russian plant. The Russia Collusion narrative was created by the DNC to avoid answering their Progressive base and having to change the Party from a Corporatist hive of corruption and back to its People driven New Deal roots. </p>
