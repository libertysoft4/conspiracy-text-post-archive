The final answer is: Jews.  I&#39;m not even joking.  Trump/Russia is a maybe, but not even as big or bad as what Hillary was doing.  Obama possibly/probably CIA, Michelle 90% sure to be a man. Hillary/U1 is more of a technical gotcha, but still wrong. Pedogate true, pizzagate still unverifiable but totally viable, Qanon=good questions/great material some real some larp.  Major politics at play.  Throughout history one usually had to be close to the people to know what&#39;s happening.  Here we are, <em>occasionally</em> rubbing shoulders with them/the info.  If Trump doesn&#39;t attempt to prosecute/curtail the activity, he gets favors done for him.  This is how politics works.  He will have to choose, <em>or to pick and choose</em>.  But do look up the JQ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh...When I first read this last reply of yours, I was slightly enchanted with the idea.  But <a href="http://www.fordhamobserver.com/inside-trumps-days-at-fordham/">a bit of research</a> shows that Trump was at Fordham only two years.  Even he had been there 4 or 6 years, I really don&#39;t see Trump as the sort who is beholden to religious ideology.  I do see him as a business man, a worldly man, and a patriotic man.  I went to a college for 5 years, and graduated with honors.  Class size averaged 23 people (so fairly small/close-knit).  I don&#39;t feel beholden to that college or its ideals whatsoever.  So I really can&#39;t see Trump feeling Jesuit.  Do you have more evidence for your theory that you&#39;d be willing to share?</p>

Most people don&#39;t take advantage of the library, and it sounds lame, but seriously it&#39;s a great place to study. Yes, you may have these resources at home (quiet place, computer, internet) but there is a lot to be said about a dedicated environment for no-nonsense research. You are always primed to do work when entering; the same cannot be said when I sit down at my desktop and have the icons of a dozen video games staring back at me. </p>

<p>open-mindedness and willingness to learn is undoubtedly important, but you must embrace critical thinking, too! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jesuits created the Illuminati in the late 18th Century (Adam Weishaupt was a Jesuit) right after the Jesuit Suppression in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV kicked all the Jesuits out of Europe. So the Jesuits OWNED the Illuminati as a front company.</p>

<p>Since the Jesuits have been around since the 11th Century, they have far more infiltrated agents and more knowledge than the Illuminati, that&#39;s why they are beating them at such a high level right now. Think of the Illuminati as a breakaway LLC, and the parent company (Jesuits) destroying the LLC and creating a new LLC to replace it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s their last ditch effort. So don&#39;t feel bad when the media ruins Trump&#39;s reputation with all these slimy stories. Let them eat each other and ruin each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the natural progression of Western society and capitalism playing themselves out. These problems were less apparent before we had advanced tech, back when natural resources and careers were easier to find. Now we&#39;re all free-falling with very little shared culture to cling to. It&#39;s natural for a society like this to splinter when we have as many opinions as problems. You see it less in places like China, where they have a very strong cultural &#39;glue.&#39; </p>

<p>And of course lots of conspiracies go on in the background to divert resources and control the populace, holding it all together. Some are also working to tear it all down for their own benefit. Figuring out who&#39;s on which side and how much you should worry about it is the tricky part. </p>

What then is the meaning of solidarity or unity?  The embracing of homosexuality and the pedophilia that comes with it?  All this stuff... is de-moralizing.  Demoralization causes a dwindling of the lifeforce within us.  God=life. Good/God=life-promoting.  Sin=life demoting.  We have become a sinful society.  Ironically, a society of infidels.

    <div class="md"><p>America is not crumbling economically.  <strong>Everyone</strong> got a tax break, so fuck off with that.  Reason why is that Republicans won&#39;t get elected if they don&#39;t put the country into debt further, just as the democrats do.  Each party gives handouts, they just give them out differently.  One is social programs, other is cash/less taxes.  One equals more government, the other less.  Best thing you can do is stand up for truth and stay sane.  Also be kind to each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Big Picture:</p>

<p>An awakening is taking place. Some sort of global consciousness shift. The people who have had access to &quot;hidden knowledge&quot; and &quot;the mysteries&quot; know that this ascension shift is coming, and have been putting as many people and narratives in place to derail it. </p>

<p>The ruling paradigm, of the West at least, is a cabal of satanic pedophiles. It looks to me like, at the top of the food chain, is worship of Moloch. I think this because of all the child abuse and sacrifice (and yes, I count abortion as child sacrifice). Moloch is blesses these people for a while, but ultimately they become fodder as well when their usefulness is done. </p>

<p>Nationally, one of two things is happening:</p>

<p>One: A counter-force to the Moloch types has finally gotten its shit together in the past decade or so and is finally pushing back. They are good and decent, and even though they have to make some compromises, their overall motivations are benevolent.</p>

<p>Two: The counterforce is just as evil, if not more so, than the current controlling paradigm. Considering how evil the current paradigm is, this seems difficult to believe. I tend to think they are slightly less evil, that they&#39;re not on board with all the child raping/killing. </p>

<p>Trump is no hero, he&#39;s a figurehead for the counterforce group, who needed a &quot;name,&quot; a &quot;persona&quot; everybody knows. He&#39;s mostly there to distract from the real heavy shit that&#39;s going down, and the media plays along. </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible all this is merely theater, entertainment before the asteroid hits or the solar wave fries all the electronics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes it feels like there&#39;s a delicate balance between TPTB&#39;s control and plans vs outright revolt by the population. Sometimes things seem to tip a little too far either way, thngs look like they&#39;re going to stray into unharmonious territory, and resources are put into play to bring things back into balance so the sheep can keep on being sheep.</p>

<p>For instance, when there&#39;s something that pisses off the population and makes them sit up and take notice (profiteering, war crimes, overreach, erosion of rights, whatever) TPTB say, &quot;We can&#39;t have that! Distract them so they go back to watching the Kardashians! Make Donald say something controversial again! Fuck that mayor over in that little podunk town with some big scandal! Hint at something so people look elsewhere!&quot;</p>

<p>trump himself is a puppet. they picked someone who would create the biggest circus. Americans are focused on bullshit issues while tptb do their thing. its the same with obama. every one cried for hope and when he was elected it was like bush ver 3.0</p>

<p>look at how we are arming the Ukraine and still imposing sanctions on Russia despite trumps friendly rhetoric on Russia. its all a show for us dumb assess who care more what other garbage they can pump out with the starwars name than where our tax money is going.</p>

<p>there is no war going on in government, only a live drama with all our favorite (read:elected) actors.</p>
