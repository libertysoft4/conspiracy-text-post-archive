    <div class="md"><p>He believed himself to be an honorable policeman who reported on his own brothers in blue for the sake of justice, but got to fed up with the system and went on a police hunt. He stole cars to try to get away until he was isolated in a cabin where police decided to shoot him down, so he wouldnt go to trial. </p>

<p>He wrote a manifesto that explains the roots of his anger supposedly just outting his co-workers, but that was talked down on because the media made him out to be a psycho. </p>

<p>Also during this whole Dorner situation, CA was in a state of emergency and a cop accidentally shot at asian women, thinking it was Dorner. </p>

<p>There def is a cover up here, or else they&#39;d bring him to trial. </p>

<p>No. IIRC, they used incendiaries, then said they were &quot;smoke grenades&quot;. There was no &quot;fire fight&quot;. Just fire (literally).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s also a lot of fake and edited manifestos. It&#39;s become so convoluted I&#39;m not sure what the original is. </p>

<p>Dorner wanted to expose corruption in the LAPD after witnessing cops get off scott free after breaking the rules. </p>

<p>The manhunt was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen. I followed the entire thing while it was going on and the ending was very revealing in the way they burned him alive in that cabin. </p>

<p>I remember something about him trying to come out before being shot at by cops shortly before they set the cabin on fire. Very crazy situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe a lot of people were secretly rooting for him. I must admit, I hoped that he would escape somehow and live a life on the run and never be found. I can&#39;t justify why I felt that way because of all the cops he killed but it was just a weird sort of wish I had for him because his manifesto was pretty honest and revealed how deeply corrupt the LA police force was. From what I remember, he was surrounded and willing to surrender but the order was to burn the cabin down and not let him out. It ended very badly for him, probably because they did not want him talking if they were to arrest him. Dead men tell no tales.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because he a cop that started killing other corrupt cops and you know what happens when you cross the thin blue line...
Also you should read his manifesto, I don&#39;t think he was angry at all, just frustrated. 
Also I sometimes doubt wither or not he was killed. The body was burned to ashes and somehow his I.D. survives.. I really hope he is chilling somewhere in the world and just waiting to make his reappearance.
Honestly they needed people to believe he was dead regardless of it&#39;s true, part of the powers that be powers are fluffed up, art of war you know? Make your enemy believe you are a million strong even if it&#39;s not true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I happened to be snowboarding in Big Bear the day he was burned out of the cabin. I live in Los Angeles, but my family has a mountain cabin near Big Bear. The night before, I drove up to the mountains to board the next day. On the mountain that day, we saw a slew of helicopters and eventually some smoke. We eventually left to head back to LA. We eventually had to pull into a gas station, where LEOs had the road closed. </p>

<p>Before I proceed, I should probably stop and say that I used to have a 2004 GMC Yukon XL, black, with dark windows.<a href="https://imgur.com/osK5nGA"> I also had a ZORT sticker on the side,</a> which I think is important. </p>

<p>Now my buddy and I are at this gas station with about 20 other cars. Being somewhat of a local, I drive towards where the officers are, to ask if I could continue, as I&#39;m taking a road less traveled. [For those that know the area, I was near Running Springs, where the 330 meets the 18. As I approach, the officer just waves me through, without wanting to talk to me. I assume, in the confusion of everything, he mistook my Zombie sticker for an official sticker. </p>

<p>My buddy and I go with it, as we have no interest in hanging around to see how long it will take to pan out. (I hear the road didn&#39;t re-open for another 8 hours.) We start heading towards the Highway 18 turnoff, avoiding what is almost certainly a shit-show on Highway 330. The road is empty, and it&#39;s great. I was able to back towards Lake Gregory in almost 10 minutes. Somewhere along our route, we get behind official vehicles. A lot of them. Eventually, at Old Waterman Canyon, I get pulled over. Someone didn&#39;t recognize us, and figured they&#39;d investigate. Good old LAPD, in San Bernadino County, still being an asshole. Eventually the guy realized he couldn&#39;t give me a ticket for anything because a fellow officer had mistakenly let me through the road closure. He allows us to leave, and we follow them all the way down the mountain. </p>

<p>We stopped for gas once we were all the way down the mountain at the station off of Hwy18 and E40th St. I got these pictures from that parking lot. The convoy parked in an adjacent lot to the station, and was not fond of me taking pictures, despite four officers approaching me to take pictures of my vehicle. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Obos0">The album.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was also an opportunity for the autorities to publicly reveal the idea of using drones to search for Dorner. The US military uses drones in other parts of the world, but drone us inside the US, has never officially been acknowledged, for a manhunt at least. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/11/chris-dorner-drones-lapd">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/11/chris-dorner-drones-lapd</a></p>

<p>The public reaction to this idea was  overtly hostile, for good reason, and the issue has not been raised by the authorities since. It&#39;s just a matter of time of course, because the &quot;germ of an idea&quot; has been planted, a bit like a vaccine, and reaction to the idea will diminish in time.</p>

<p>Also, there is an interesting &quot;cosmic coincidence&quot; (or more subliminal manipulation of the public, take your pick) in that the name Chris Dorner can be rearranged as &quot;Sirchr Drone&quot; (Searcher Drone).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure what he supposedly did to get on the bad side of LAPD but when cops shoot a truck that looks kind of similar to Dorner&#39;s from the back, dozens of times, killing old ladies inside, whatever it was they wanted him quiet.  When he ran into the snow covered cabin, rather than wait him out.... they set fire to the cabin.  He knew something.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only in retrospect, do a lot of these &quot;stand-alone&quot; media narratives start to make sense within the wider context of now-uncovered corruption.</p>

<p>Celebrities who you THOUGHT randomly overdosed turned out to have been victims of the Hollywood trafficking networks. (Like Corey Haim, as one prominent example. Or River Phoenix.) </p>

<p>You talk: You die.</p>

<p>In the logic of the now-established over-arching narrative, the frame-up and murder of Christopher Dorner invites re-examination within the context of pedogate and the West Coast trafficking hubs (that we &quot;euphemistically call &quot;sanctuary cities&quot;). These are law-free zones where narcotics, children and weapons are being sold . . . with the government and law-enforcement up to their ears in it.</p>

<p>The smart money says that Dorner refused to &quot;play ball&quot;. </p>
