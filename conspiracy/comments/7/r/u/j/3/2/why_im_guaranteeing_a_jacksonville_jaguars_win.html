        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>American Professional Sports has long been under the thumb of some dastardly villains. It goes without saying the Mafia&#39;s influence in Professional Boxing. I can&#39;t think of a single sport that is free from some sort of controversy whether it be point shaving, drugs, refs controlling the outcome of games/series of games, etc. </p>

<p>That said, you might be asking where&#39;s the conspiracy in tomorrow&#39;s matchup between the New England Patriots and the Jacksonville Jaguars? Well, it&#39;s pretty simple. Those powers that heavily influence professional sports are more of the international type nowadays. In fact, the NFL, itself, has been pushing the international agenda for some time now with the Jacksonville Jaguars center stage. From the London Games to calls for the team to relocate to the UK and their owner being Pakistani, there&#39;s no hiding the intentions of the NFL and its handlers. After all, creating a larger market means a greater bottom line.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem. The Jaguars are relatively unknown and, in recent years, have sucked the big one. In order to push the agenda, the globalists need to give the Jaguars a big push. Almost like in the WWE. What&#39;s a bigger push than a spot in the biggest game on the planet viewed by millions globally? As they say, the scene is set and the actors in their places. </p>

<p>To make it easier to swallow, current events will be used as excuses for how the heavily favored Patriots were ultimately defeated by, what is perceived to be, an inferior opponent. From the rumblings of a rift between Robert Kraft, Bill Belichick, and Tom Brady, both offensive and defensive coordinators leaving town for head coaching positions at season&#39;s end, to Tom Brady&#39;s phantom hand injury during practice this week, there&#39;s more than enough headlines to fuel the eminent smokescreen for weeks to come. </p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m dead wrong if the Patriots win. But, as of this moment, none can convince me otherwise. </p>

<p>One last thought. The NFL released a Super Bowl promo on its Facebook page featuring the Patriots and the Vikings for which they later apologized for. Deniers of what I&#39;m saying will point to this to erroneously disprove any conspiracy exists. &quot;Look! See!? The Jags won!&quot; Well, of course they did. You simply fell for the NFL&#39;s lame misdirection attempt with that Facebook promo. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t think that one of the biggest corporations in the world would have ads ready for any possible outcomes of this weekend? That&#39;s why a bunch of championship clothing for the losing team gets sent elsewhere in the world after events like the Super Bowl, because they prepare for any outcome. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, who dat in the Super Bowl?  Congrats.  If this is it for Brady it would be a pretty fabulous finish.  Basically, it&#39;s his ability to think quickly that&#39;s made them such a force for so long, and he could probably keep going if he wants.  It will be interesting to see how they deal with replacing him, whenever that may be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im a londoner and an NFL medicore fan but a London NFL team is complete BS. It shouldnt happen and will do shit all with marketing and make more profits. NFL is a much better idea in general if you want to expand this americab sport to the world. Also the Jags owner owns Fulham a 2nd divisoion football team in england which seems like this Khan guy just an average stupid billionaire with no real connection to the higher ups, i could be wrong since i havent done research but basing on first impression. 
Anyway your post has excited me to find the result of tomo&#39;a result. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as I’d love for the Jags to beat the Pats, I just don’t see it happening. The Jag’s defense is formidable, but they can only hold the fort down so long. The Patriots are the best at halftime adjustments on both sides of the ball. They usually dominate 3rd quarters and put teams away, if they’re not already. No matter how great your defense is, in today’s game you have to score points to win. Yes, the Jag’s offense looked better last week, but they’re going up against one of the craziest brains in Bill Belichick. That said, stranger things have happened. Just hope it’s not a blowout. </p>

It very well be the Globalists give him one last hoo rah before he finally gets the injury that puts him into retirement. He goes out with grace on the world stage.

<p>This year&#39;s SB will be a snoozer (pats-Viks-Pats win) that most people with find out about Monday morning. Revenue will be down in all areas and roger will use that to pitch a SB in Wembley. </p>

<p>I predict the SB in Wembley in 5-7 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if Jax won, beyond any “conspiracies&quot; simply because of the old adage of &quot;defense  wins championships&quot;. well, that and coughlin taking over this year. coughlin had pats number twice before in the super bowl. jags d has been top 5 all year and have been building on it in the draft/fa for the last 3 yrs. i still have fond memories the last time ray lewis played the pats... brady, like all qbs, don&#39;t like being hit. jags also had a top flight run game by adding  fournette this year. even despite the robinson injury jags have had many pieces that needed to gel that have seemingly worked out this year. playing old fashioned football, heavy defense and possession control the clock with a ground game is always a winning formula, which is even more capable when bortles hasn&#39;t turned the ball over thus far in the playoffs. to me, i would see a bigger conspiracy with all the pats discussion lately should they win (maybe only because i&#39;m a Raider fan)...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Patriots are 33-19 in the playoffs. Brady is 26-9. Teams led by Brady have failed 7 times to reach the Superbowl after making the playoffs. Failed to win the SB twice. A loss to the Jaguars won&#39;t be that unusual.  I know some believe they try to influence games to go a certain way with penalty calls, but I&#39;ve seen it too often go against any team--bad calls go against successful teams as well as the bad. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a conspiracy here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny, but as a Minnesota resident I&#39;m convinced the fix is in for the Vikings to make the Super Bowl.</p>

<p>I mean, we&#39;re playing our third string quarterback and we have a key receiver who was an undrafted walk-on.  And we won last week&#39;s game in a totally improbably way that involved a defensive player fairly obviously making a mistake that allowed our receiver to make a touchdown.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you really can fix a football game or an entire season, but I keep wondering if the NFL is giving it to the Wilfs (the owners).  They got a new stadium built (with a lot of local controversy) and the team has kind of sucked for a few years, and if this second season in the new stadium had been another loser like last year I think that attendance would have dropped off next year and it would have cost them a lot of money.</p>
