<p>During the onset of my v2k, I and 3 family members also developed a severe and permanent tinnitus.</p>

<p>I can actually record my v2k, though it just sounds like strange noise to anyone else who listens. </p>

<p>I believe there has to be measurable evidence of this in my surrounding environment, but I know nothing about psychoacoustics/ signal analysis.  </p>

<p>Does anyone know where I could send recordings to be analyzed in an unbiased fashion? </p>

<p>Here is a link to an example of what I perceive to be unusual frequency activity around me. Can anybody give me their thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>can&#39;t really hear anything.  the tinnitus/attack? is louder for me at night and this could be preventing me from hearing it.  you may want to hit up <a href="/u/microwavedindividual">/u/microwavedindividual</a> and bounce it off of them.  </p>

<p>i think because this is becoming a somewhat common thing we should pool our resources a bit.  figure out how best to record the ambient signals - and share these methods.  and then compile a set of data from people who think this is happening to them.  maybe there are some patterns there to tease out.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. I worked for a social media data company who gave me a computer, and when u brought it home my technology was all fried.
My pc cellphone etc all went black.
I saw my work computer pulling in all my personal pictures and started just delving through files.  I found a lot of weird things...I asked a lot of questions and probably pissed people off.. but I&#39;m hesitant to jump on the theory as I have no tangible evidence. 
All I know is my V2k started very shortly after. One day I was perfectly normal. And then my life as I knew it was over. It is terribly difficult</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been hacked, every device I owned would immediately be infiltrated. It was just an amateur drug dealer/identity theif who had stolen my ID and was writing bad checks all over town with the help of a girl that looked like me (or at least passable comparison to my stolen drivers license. I think the dude had some crush/obsession with me too. No V2K, like I said this was amateur shit, but having all of your computers/phones infiltrated and fucked with and cursors moving on their own... AND no one really believed me at first. I didn&#39;t know my identity had been stolen until a few months into the hacking harassment, so that tied some stuff together. Even hacked my flip phone. How? NO CLUE, it was an old school non digital flip phone. It basically stopped when I got an iPhone but my point is, hang in there, and don&#39;t obsess too much. At one point I had a chromebook and I altered it so much so that he couldn&#39;t get into it that I made it completely unusable for myself or anyone else. Hope you find some answers </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea. I&#39;m not good with technology,which makes research so difficult because I have to learn so much as I go.</p>

<p>I worked from home most days of the week.out of the blue my employer made me come in to take a work macbook home. </p>

<p>As soon as the macbook entered my home my desktop, laptop, and iPhone all went black. And streaming across my work computer screen were all of my personal photos from the computers and phone.</p>

<p>I freaked out and broke into the administration side of the macbook and just started copying files over and changing permissions so they couldn&#39;t access things.</p>

<p>I have no clue what they did to make it sync in with my computers however they must have been able to do it remotely as when I broke into the administration files I found odd logs belonging to my cellphone from months before etc.</p>

<p>The more I dug the more I found. Weird invasive stuff. Includng clinical studies about subvocalization, machine learning, ai, etc. The v2k started shortly after.</p>

Less physically audible, but it seems always present when I think inward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you really want to make this stop, not just for yourself but for everyone, you could invest time learning about digital signal processing, then about software-defined radio and GNURadio.</p>

<p>If someone develops a GNURadio module for Voice-to-Skull, soon it will become utterly ubiquitous and so well-know that protection mechanisms will arise and will similarly become mainstream. It will become common enough for people to say &quot;who the fuck is playing pop music in my skull? This is annoying&quot;, and not sound crazy.</p>

<p>Then the government&#39;s purpose in doing that will disappear. It works only because people don&#39;t know about it and it makes them think they&#39;re crazy (or hearing God).</p>

<p>In case anyone is wondering what this “acoustic attack” (voice-to-skull) technology is, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/07/the-microwave-s/">Wired magazine talked about it years ago</a>. Also see <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/06/darpas_sonic_pr/">this</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/05/army-removes-pa/">this</a>, or <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/12/the-voice-of-go/">this</a>.</p>

<p>It was notably used in Cuba against US diplomats (by Israeli or US intelligence in my own estimation).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been hearing auditory signals (sounds from voices) since 2007. I doubt it&#39;s this tech. The influence is alien in sound and matches myths. It comes with thoughts it puts in our minds as if they are our own. We all have it. I know more because of my interactions with it.</p>

<p>It came as benevolent ETs in telepathy. It became apparent they wanted to use what I believed or thought was true, failing my personal goals, as a pretext to sell plausible deceptions, that divine punishment, abandonment to darkness was the likely result.</p>

<p>They did it to feed on negative emotions. Tour beliefs elicit our emotions and they constructed beliefs to make negative emotions. So, after I figured out their pattern, I called them out on it.</p>

<p>Then they showed me their alien voice, full of contempt, anxiety, offensiveness and a strong whiny nasal sound. There is no human that sounds lime them. They mostly use it to make wordless vocalizations to manipulate my emotions. Sometimes they use words, but usually repetitively and uncreatively. Their most common phrase is <em>you hate me</em>. <em>We hate you</em> is common. <em>We&#39;re done, we&#39;re leaving, take him</em>, and a few more come to mind.</p>

<p>Actually, these beings are lazy with language, because they use telepathy. They send thoughts to me as communication. They are much faster and more detailed. However, they don&#39;t usually identify themselves when they do. They just put the thoughts there as my own.</p>

<p>Thoughts tempting me to be out of balance or integrity with myself and others are common. Thoughts getting me to judge myself and others as inadequate, reducing appreciation are also common. Thoughts that makee feel negative emotions are basically what they are all about.</p>

<p>I used to think these were my thoughts. They&#39;ve always been there. However, after my interactions intensified, after I called them out, they repeatedly demonstrated the connection. They intertwined their vocalization harassment, telepathic attacks and thought insertions. It became clear they were giving me those thoughts. They&#39;d react to failure and success of those thoughts and even modify them based on how I react. They apparently don&#39;t feel the need to conceal as much as before.</p>

<p>Meditation abates this foreign mind. It makes it stick out to your mind and more easily be dismissed. It&#39;s not all your subconscious mind.</p>

<p>I went through 2 separate days recently where the influence was almost absent for unknown reasons. OMG! A song comes to mind.</p>

<p>*I can see clearly now that the rain has gone..&quot;</p>

<p>I felt content bordering on happy, living in the now, focused on my surroundings, not my seemingly endless&quot; internal&quot; chatter. People enjoyed me more as I was happier and could interact more with them in a valuable way.</p>

<p>This very recent experience, within the last few months, has shown me even more how this foreign mind affects us. It is a parasite of mind, acting like an automatic machine, a hive of mind, that assimilates ours by having us emulate theirs, by agreeing with covert inserted thoughts to think and act just like them. Just as with any parasite, removing it makes you feel more energy and wellbeing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to report to all, but this is real. It has been spoken of by many. This is the myth of the devil, tempting man. The hive I speak of has ET beings attached I am sure. They are the origin of the myth of demons. Their hive mind is like Satan. They want to own and control us after feeding on our emotional energy like meth heads. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to report this unpleasant thing to you all, but this is real. It has been spoken of by many, gnostics, shamans, new ages and ET contactees. This is the origin of the myth of the devil, tempting man. The hive I speak of has ET beings attached to it I am sure. They are the origin of the myths of demons. If they were present, no doubt they&#39;d be causing fear, negative emotions and pain as they do remotely. Their hive mind is like Satan. They want to own and control us as new members, after feeding on our emotional energy like meth heads. Doing so facilitates the process of assimilation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have certain experiences that are similar to yours. Random thought insertions , or responses to thought etc.  At times people around me will have the same ones, and they believe completely it was their own thought ....though it was totally random and out now context. 
However I just believe technology can do these things. I believe machine learning , ai, brain entrainment, subvocalization technologies. ..make it all plausible minus e.t. ... 
I believe everyone has the right to their own assumptions (goes without saying) ..it would be nice to have a large population of victims collect strictly evidence minus speculation and see what correlations we can find.
Like scripts we here, frequencies , etc. I&#39;ve met one other target in person, a former reporter who had totally different theories than me regarding the tech. And the keywords and  phrases we heard were nearly identical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why we are so averse to considering ETs. FFS, we are the equivalent of ETs. If we came from another planet or star system and visited Earth, we&#39;d be ETs. Our existence is proof that ETs exist. Our arrogance and self-superiority blinds us to this obvious truth. </p>

<p>The question is, why don&#39;t we interact with ETs if they exist? </p>

<p>The topic we just spoke of explains it well. The more decent towards benevolent ETs are inclined to inform us of our occupiers. This does not serve them. To help hosts cast away their parasites does not serve the parasites, obviously. So, they strongly limit interactions with ETs. They can&#39;t stop them all. Some people do have ET experiences.</p>

<p>They hide a lot of knowledge from us. They are preparing us to be added to their unwholy, self-serving organization. It has many facets of control. They have money, whole many other ETs don&#39;t. Money is a time and effort control system. They intend to interlink us into their monetary usury system, their space empire with a taste for loosh.</p>

<p>They also hide the danger of merging with technology from us, soothing our concerns with clever argumentation. They are a hive of useless eaters of value for consciousness, because they merged with machines and cut off the positive emotional experiences that allow them to create the energy. They are self-serving machines controlled by a integrated network of self-serving machines. This is their nature from personal experience, ET contactees and the old and new writings on this topic. It fits together like a puzzle. It makes a lot of the unanswered questions have plausible answers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. I worked for a social media data company who gave me a computer, and when u brought it home my technology was all fried.
My pc cellphone etc all went black.
I saw my work computer pulling in all my personal pictures and started just delving through files.  I found a lot of weird things...I asked a lot of questions and probably pissed people off.. but I&#39;m hesitant to jump on the theory as I have no tangible evidence. 
All I know is my V2k started very shortly after. One day I was perfectly normal. And then my life as I knew it was over. It is terribly difficult</p>
