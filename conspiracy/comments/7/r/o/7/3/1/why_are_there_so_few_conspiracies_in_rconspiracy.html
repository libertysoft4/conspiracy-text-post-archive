        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve spent a few weeks here now and what I&#39;ve noticed is that most of the submissions here are just regurgitations of whatever&#39;s happening in the news. For example, we&#39;re currently getting a lot of submissions regarding the government shutdown even though there&#39;s really no conspiracy behind it. </p>

<p>So far in the time I&#39;ve spent here only a few real conspiracies have been posted, most notably this one:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7r324r/asteroids_meteors_and_more_nasa_lies_oh_my/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7r324r/asteroids_meteors_and_more_nasa_lies_oh_my/</a></p>

<p>Aside from this though, it&#39;s pretty much just political stuff. No conspiracies. Others are also starting to bring up how partisan politics is appearing in this sub now too. Ugh. How can we fix this and start discussing real conspiracies here instead of wasting our time clicking on what are basically just news articles in r/conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What conspiracies are you into?</p>

<p>I tend to take a more ecological perspective on conspiracies. Less that there are shadowy  long term cabals and more that power tends to try and accumulate more power because it fears loss of control and ultimately death.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s the herd, the general population, and there are the predators, people who excel at accumulating power. Predators can form hunting packs or go solo. Most of the herd is concerned with just eating grass and fucking.</p>

<p>Following the path of power accumulation (currency) tends to be a really good way of figuring out where and who the predators are.</p>

<p>I enjoy the speculative fiction more traditionally associated with conspiracy theories, and keep an open mind to the ones that obviously have a lot of coherent thought it into them. Unfortunately most of the extremely speculative seems to paralyze people in impossible mental situations and keep them from making change in their lives. Kind of a terror porn sort of thing.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>By posting the content you want to see and discussing the real conspiracies as you understand them. As others have mentioned, the /new queue is where most of the real discussion takes place. Unfortunately, actors from several sides tend to downvote good material and upvote divisive and partisan news-cycle bullshit, meaning a lot of good material never hits the front page. It&#39;s here, but it gets hidden. </p>

<p>Research and make a well-source self.post about a topic you find interesting, and I and the other mods would be happy to give it a sticky for a day or so. I made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7rjfkz/victoria_nuland_named_ceo_of_center_for_a_new/">this post</a> today about Victoria Nuland and the role of policy think tanks in shaping American foreign policy. We will always welcome and promote content like this.</p>

<p>Anything &quot;fringe&quot;, really. Aliens, lost ancient technology and civilizations, hollow Earth, phantom timeline,  past lives, occult, esoteric, damn near anything &quot;super natural&quot;. You know, grand conspiracies. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not necessarily talking about that topic, c&#39;mon Celine, I do not have a one track mind, <em>you know that</em>.  Like I said above. Also, why does it have to be a self.post to get stickied? Why not a &quot;fringe&quot; documentary or article? This is not a college course, some of y&#39;all are acting like it is. <em>That&#39;s a problem, imo</em>. We&#39;ve talked about this before, though. </p>

<p>Indeed, that is a (main) problem with the platform. Which none of us &quot;users&quot; really have any control over. We need a new platform, tbh.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not necessarily asking for that, and... like I&#39;ve said before, I really do think you and others are making a mountain out of a molehill. There are some very simple things that can be done, it&#39;s just some of you do not care, or more likely, are overthinking (which I truly think you are). </p>

<p>Anything &quot;fringe&quot;, really.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d agree. I think this is just as much a shift in the broader conspiracy &quot;community&quot; if you could call it that than this sub specifically. 5 years ago, the number of people who would self-identify with &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; who entertained at least one or two fringe topics was maybe about half. Those people are all still here, but now we have a huge influx of people who are only into the more &quot;concrete&quot; political and governmental theories. The fraction of CTs who will entertain fringe topics is probably closer to 5–10%. (Pulling these numbers out of my ass, but I think the trend is real and pronounced.) Most Trump supporters believe Hillary is involved in one or more conspiracies and vice versa for anti-Trumpers. Even ignoring shills for the moment, the fringe people are again a minority. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not have a one track mind, you know that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never said you did, but I do know these are topics you&#39;re quite interested in, and I&#39;d like more exposure for. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, why does it have to be a self.post to get stickied? Why not a &quot;fringe&quot; documentary or article?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The current sidebar sticky on the Pyramids is pretty fringe, by this sub&#39;s standards at least. I know you disagree with the Sphinx/Lion connection and likely a few other aspects of that doc, though. I&#39;m not opposed to stickying articles or docs, but I do have a strong preference for stickying OC. I think (without any hard evidence) that it inspires and rewards others here to do their own research and connect their own dots rather than just taking someone else&#39;s word for it. I don&#39;t personally want (and I don&#39;t think you do) people to just take others&#39; word on any of these topics; I want them to learn the skills to research and discern truth themselves. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not necessarily asking for that, and... like I&#39;ve said before, I really do think you and others are making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re the one who brought this up. Yes, there are some simple steps that could be taken to make a difference (I agree with you on some, fully disagree on others), but short of banning or severely restricting the amount of overtly political content here, the political will always be more popular than the fringe. It&#39;s called fringe for a reason. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need a new platform, tbh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree, but we&#39;ll always run into the problem of direction vs. reach. These are necessary tradeoffs in any discussion platform. <a href="/r/AlternativeHistory">/r/AlternativeHistory</a> has a very specific direction, and you and CapAp keep that direction rather well. As a side effect, the sub doesn&#39;t have that broad a reach. Most people just aren&#39;t that into it. This sub has a very broad reach, and as the tradeoff, the direction is pushed and pulled by all sides, both from within the mod team, the userbase, and outside influencers. I&#39;m not saying this to be defeatist, but it is the nature of these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putting a flair like that on a post at or near 0 upvotes won&#39;t do much, unfortunately. It&#39;s still unlikely to hit the front page, and the flair would draw just as many downvotes from people suspicious of the mod team and those who disagree with the post. If, on the off chance the post would hit /hot, it&#39;s likely the discussion would be focused more on the meta of why the mods flaired it. </p>

it must be so obvious which posts get attacked and also by whom.</p>

<p>this sub is in such a terrible state.... what is the point of being a mod here if they aint modding it.   lol</p>

<p>please don&#39;t ban me. but the blame has to fall somewhere and quite frankly its very suspicious that it has been left to get this bad. :D</p>

<p>How would it even work? If I put a flair on a post that&#39;s sitting at 40% an hour into the /new queue, the only people who are even going to see it are people who were already on the /new queue and had a chance to upvote it. </p>

<p>am i really having to explain this... duh</p>

<p>theres plenty of things in new that don&#39;t get brigaded down.   as a mod its your job to filter the spam one way or another (without censorship).</p>

<p>as someone here who makes regular top quaity post that get brigaded immediatly. i know what i&#39;m talking about.  the quality stuff gets attacked immediatly and its that stuff that people need to be reading rather than let it slide down in the sea of spam.</p>

<p>There are two types that employ conspiracy into their life with meaning.</p>

<p>Those who want an adventure they cant finish.</p>

<p>Those who devote themselves to insanity by trying to find a particular truth. </p>

<p>Those who want an emotional escape through mystery, like MOST conspiracy theories, and it&#39;s a topic/brand that generates itself by people existing in doubt.</p>

<p>The other case, the deep-cases, are generally people with particular sets of adept knowledge who stumble upon discrepancies in their understanding of how reality works, and they endlessly try to expose the truth, to correct some flaw-in-knowing within themselves. These people are the heroes of the conspiracy community, as they invest into it and are devoted to their cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the issue is that a lot of the posts in this sub are just straight up politics. There&#39;s no conspiracy at all. The people putting up these links don&#39;t even mention any conspiracy in their submission statement, they just summarize whatever they&#39;re linking. </p>

<p>For example, a lot of people were posting stuff about the government shut down last night even though there&#39;s no conspiracy behind it. It&#39;s simply caused by a lack of ability to cooperate between Democrats and Republicans.</p>

<p>That being said, if you think there&#39;s some secret force behind the government shutdown then, by all means, I&#39;d love to know your theories. The problem is exactly that though, in r/conspiracy people are much more concerned with whatever the media is saying and what&#39;s on the surface, rather than looking at everything underneath. Not any of these government shutdown people have propounded any conspiracy theory to go along with their posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Implied conspiracies because it involves the almost entirely corrupt world of politics.  That&#39;s why you get so many &#39;political&#39; posts.  Because of all the older hands here though, you&#39;ll be getting fuck all decent content at all now though due to the requirement for a &quot;submission statement&quot;.  People who are into reading about conspiracies and a little more, shall we say, &#39;aware&#39; will never put anything that could be described as a &#39;statement&#39; next to their links for reasons that are obvious to anybody with their eyes open.  In fact, not too long from now I expect a few unfortunates are going to discover why they never should have done such a thoughtlessly stupid thing themselves.  There&#39;s a reason that the shill mods and a handfull of shill accounts who you never see posting anything genuinely conspiracy related (other than a couple of token gesture &#39;fringe&#39; items that they&#39;ve gathered will give them some kind of credence in the eyes of the community) were the only ones who wanted to impose this against the will of all the actual proper users who made the sub what it is (u/orangutan for example).
