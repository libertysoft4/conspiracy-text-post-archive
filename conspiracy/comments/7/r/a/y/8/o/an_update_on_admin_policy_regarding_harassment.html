        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">71</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-18 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/axolotl_peyotl.html">axolotl_peyotl</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, I need to apologize for how I handled <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7px25l/fuck_reddit/">this post</a>. It was unprofessional and immature, and I&#39;m committed to not letting it happen again.</p>

<p>After some introspection, it seems that although I&#39;ve been a mod here for several years, I still haven&#39;t wanted to relinquish my status as an independent user of this sub.</p>

<p>Before I was a mod (and in the early days after I was), I was able to post anything and everything I felt like without fear of retaliation, brigading, and general accusations of pushing &quot;propaganda.&quot;</p>

<p>Within the last year or so, this has shifted dramatically. Now the MO of the shit-stirrers is to claim that OP must believe <em>every</em> word of <em>every</em> article they submit. This obvious logical fallacy is apparently lost on many well-meaning and intelligent folks.</p>

<p><em>This is a forum for discussion</em> after all.</p>

<p>My posting habits have literally not changed in the last 10 years...I use the exact same sources and post the exact same material. However, to my utter surprise, in the course of a few months there were literal front page posts accusing me personally of being a fervent supporter of the current US administration, including fabricating quotes from me to that effect. Needless to say, I&#39;m still stunned by this development...I would never have expected it.</p>

<p>In the future, I&#39;ve decided to fully embrace my mod-dom (ooh a palindrome!) and accept that I can&#39;t be a &quot;regular&quot; user anymore, and by that I mean I can&#39;t expect to post anything without it turning into a mud-slinging battleground.</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that I used to work much harder on producing original content for the benefit of the sub, but I slowed down significantly after I became a mod. I&#39;d like to return to this approach.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve decided to avoid submitting all things political, and to devote more of my attention to modding and representing this sub in a positive way, as well as producing and sharing more original content. I refuse to add fuel to their fire any longer. They want us to fall in to their partisan trap.</p>

<p>With respect to the reddit admins, sadly I don&#39;t have anything positive to report.</p>

<p>Part of the reason why I got so frustrated last week is that I wanted to be able to present <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with <em>some</em> degree of good news with respect to the targeted harassment currently plaguing our sub.</p>

<p>As the current top (active) mod, I need to be able to represent this community with confidence and conviction. My mistake was looking to the admins for any support whatsoever.</p>

<p>I now realize that not only do the admins not care, we don&#39;t <em>need</em> them to: we have each other (as corny as that sounds) and ultimately that&#39;s all we need.</p>

<p>For years, when people would reach out to me personal regarding serious harassment/threats, I would redirect them to the admins. </p>

<p>Despite receiving countless threats myself over the years, I always brushed them off and instead found them empowering, as they were indicative that I was clearly doing <em>something</em> right.</p>

<p>However, as more and more <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users began personally reaching out to me regarding this incessant harassment, I realized that simply passing them on to some sort of nebulous concept of the reddit &quot;admins&quot; was both ineffective and irresponsible.</p>

<p>So about 6 months ago, I contacted the admins personally for the first time after a decade of using reddit. I formally laid out the case that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community was being regularly targeted, harassed and brigaded. I also included links to threatening PMs I had received at the time (a mere fraction of the total I&#39;ve received over the years).</p>

<p>Despite receiving the stock reply of &quot;thanks for your message, we&#39;re looking into it&quot; from the admins I assumed that I had done all I could at the time, and I chose to remain optimistic that the situation would improve.</p>

<p>Well, it hasn&#39;t. As more and more users started reaching out to me about this unacceptable behavior, and as my account started to get even more aggressively targeted, last month I felt it necessary to reach out to the admins again.</p>

<p>I sent them examples of when subs like SRD and TMOR (directly) link to our sub, and then &quot;shockingly&quot; regular users/mods get comments downvoted to below -1000/-1500 (unheard of on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) and the entire comment section devolves into a hateful anti-conspiracy circlejerk.</p>

<p>That type of behavior is unacceptable on any subreddit, but for some reason, it&#39;s allowed to occur when <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is in the crosshairs. </p>

<p>After reaching out to the admins this second time, I again received what appeared to be a prepared response along the lines of &quot;thanks for your reports, we&#39;re looking into it.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point, I <em>really</em> started to doubt that I was even corresponding with a human being. In my third message, I stressed the fact that not only were the users that had recently sent me very threatening PMs active, but the ones that I had reported <em>6 months earlier</em> were still active as well.</p>

<p>To me, this indicates that reddit policy is to simply ignore users that send literal death threats and let them continue with impunity.</p>

<p>This was <em>not</em> the news I wanted to share with you all, hence my palpable frustration in that post last week.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I <em>finally</em> received a message from the admins that sounds like it was written by an actual human:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey there, Sorry, we may not discuss account statuses with anybody other than the account creator. However, not all punitive actions we may take are publicly visible to users. Please continue to report site violations and any private messages that violate the site rules and we&#39;ll be happy to review it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not exactly sure what this means, but it certainly confirms my suspicions that the admins are taking an extremely hands off approach when it comes to targeted harassment and death threats.</p>

<p>As an aside, this begs the question: what does it take to get shadowbanned?</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, &quot;shadowbanning&quot; is a tool used by the reddit admins to &quot;delete&quot; your account without you being any the wiser. In fact, shadowbanned users can still participate on reddit, <em>but no one can see their comments or even their user page</em>. Some folks have continued participating on reddit for years as a shadowbanned user (which is insane). </p>

<p>Subreddit moderators actually have the ability to <em>see</em> and approve comments from shadowbanned users, but that&#39;s where our power ends. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so common to find shadowbanned users that I often go to the top threads on the sub (that have lots of comments) specifically to find them and inform them of their unfortunate situation.</p>

<p>So...what <em>does</em> it take to get shadowbanned if every single user that has sent me death threats is still using reddit without a problem?</p>

<p>Considering reddit&#39;s obsession with &quot;positive PR&quot;, how well does it reflect on reddit inc. that they turn a blind eye (and essentially condone) the constant harassment of an entire community on their website?</p>

<p>The answer is that it reflects abysmally poorly.</p>

<p>Now that it&#39;s clear that the admins don&#39;t care, I feel armed with this knowledge, and instead of being disheartened by it, I choose to be empowered.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need the admins. </p>

<p>We have each other. </p>

<p>Thank you all for your understanding and your dedication to the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community and everything we represent. </p>

<p>We are not unified on any front, despite their attempt to portray conspiracy theorists as adhering to a specific set of beliefs.</p>

<p>What <em>does</em> unite us is our desire for the truth and for the amelioration of the state of our civilization.</p>

<p>At the risk of oversimplification, they are fueled by hatred, and we are united by love.</p>

<p>And in the end, love <em>always</em> wins.</p>

<p>Thank you for everything <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>-AP</p>

<p>Not my claim, but some might think your postings are at times racially biased against minorities.  Would not then the Redditpolice as it were, not turn a blind eye to those that allow and even cultivate that behaviour?  </p>

<p>To some, the perception of Rule one is &quot;see we even have rule one, how can we be racist?!&quot;  Sound familiar?</p>

<p>If the sub maintains its seemingly racially contentious nature, one can only expect the admins aren&#39;t going to give a shit about what they consider to be your fee-fees.</p>

<p>Not trying to be a dick but this should be obvious.</p>

<p>Edit: LOL. Sure.  Just downvote a well reasoned argument without saying anything because reasons. Anyone following along knows AP has been called racist by his detractors.  Fuck me for thinking the admins might think the same.</p>

<p>If your gonna make a claim don&#39;t wimp out and say, &quot;Not me but I can assume others&quot; as a means of walking away when it falls apart; have pride in your opinion. It makes it hard to take you seriously when you clearly are lying before you even start.</p>

<p>But I thought it was &quot;not your claim&quot;??</p>

<p>And that&#39;s an interesting sub name it&#39;s almost as if the conclusion was already made up before it was even created... Oh and where is anything that <a href="/u/axotlotl_peyotl">/u/axotlotl_peyotl</a> posted on that sub???</p>

<p>Well first of all it&#39;s called a typing a comment no need to open my mouth... But second of all what do I not know? That apparently there is all these closet racists on this sub? The one&#39;s that all get down-voted to shit and only have examples every 3 weeks hardly a consistent pattern...</p>

<p>Why are you here again? To have meaningful contribution to this sub or to create this false sense of intellectual superiority for &quot;dealing with&quot; the &quot;racists&quot; (All in your fantasy land of course)?</p>

<p>What &quot;removed link to mitigate drama&quot; um what drama my b.s. meter is off the charts right now... Call me whatever you want I&#39;m just making you prove your own claim and it sounds to me like you can&#39;t and maybe just maybe that means that you should <strong>use this as a learning example to change your mind</strong>...</p>

<p>Something I have never understood is shadowbanning. What is the point of putting someone in a timeout/solitary confinement if they are unaware of the punishment?

<p>It was started to thwart spammers.  Why would you tell a spammer their post is removed or the account banned?</p>

<p>Problem is that the admins were understaffed and constantly trying to keep the servers up and so they just started using SBs on bad actors, trolls, scum and a lot of regular users as well.  That was an awful thing.</p>

<p>I used to find shadowbanned users talking to themselves in my subs spam filters and it was the saddest thing ever.  I began telling them because why the fuck would I want some user caught up in some innocuous shit spinning their wheels like that.</p>

<p>you can tell it&#39;s him because he uses similar usernames, goes through people&#39;s post histories trying to expose them, and uses lots of emojis.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re posting an article and don&#39;t believe it, then you should probably make that known. This seems like an absurdly easy fix that he shouldn&#39;t have to complain about. Don&#39;t want people to think you agree with the article? Make it known when you post it. Takes 30 seconds to leave a comment saying &quot;I don&#39;t necessarily agree with what this is claiming, but I thought it would be a good discussion&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of times articles are posted as evidence towards a specific aspect.  Let&#39;s say a US gov publication states that research into spacecraft breaking the speed of light has positive results.  So OP uses that information for his argument into wormholes or whatever.  Then a comment in the replies tries to discredit him by saying that the article stated, &quot;however, no UFOs in our known atmosphere have ever broken the speed of light.&quot;  </p>

<p>Using XYZ to try and discredit ABC is a problem where attention shifts away from the original.  If the person feels strongly enough about the UFO statement then they could make their own post with their own evidence.  It is a tactic used to discourage active users and push lurkers away.  Maybe I was really interested in OPs post but come to the comments and the top 10 comments are all blatantly disagreeing with OP by using subsections of the article and are off topic.  It pushes the lazy away from becoming more active and asking relevant questions.  </p>

<p>The mistakes u/axolotl_peyotl made are very minor IMO.  Frustrations are an emotional state of humans. Mistakes are a condition of being human.  Recognizing mistakes is a characteristic of a <strong>decent</strong> human being.  </p>

Don&#39;t get disheartened by the hate, there will always be those that wish to bring you down and you surely know by now that mods are a prime target, especially of any kind of psychological harassment.

<p>Keep being yourself, do what you feel is true for you. Spread peace, compassion and love, as well as the truth.</p>

<p>There is no need to apologize for the post that you made, receiving death threats and the like is enough to get anyone to flip out. </p>

<p>Moderating is a thankless job.  Literally can go a year without someone so much as even saying thanks for the reply after they message me.  But make one decision and you&#39;ll hear quickly from users negative things.  Make a different decision and you&#39;ll hear from a whole different group of people.  </p>

<p>At times it seriously feels like a no-win type of situation.</p>

<p>And I for one HATE heavy handed moderation so I only make decisions when something is clearly a violation of the few rules we have in the subs I moderate.  I also try to counter the negativity by responding why I&#39;m removing posts but people still love to flame others.  </p>

<p>However, this seems like one of the better, more open subs out there for all kinds of discussions.  I hope that doesn&#39;t change because it&#39;s one reason I come here.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m not really a fan of that style of moderation at all.  I&#39;ve completely left subs because they did the same to me.  It was a one day ban but it was a minor rule infraction, zero warning and BAM...banned for a day.  </p>

<p>That was really off putting so I just quit participating in that sub.  </p>

<p>In case anyone was wondering, the perma ban was for rule 8/harrassment when commenting in a spammed post by the shill &quot;Squishyisbest&quot; (he may finally have been banned because I haven&#39;t seen his spammed posts lately). But my comment was 
&quot;Oh look it&#39;s Squishy doing what Squishy does best!&quot;. Yep received a perma ban for it I kid you not and he got away scott free even though he was literally breaking the rules and I didn&#39;t .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Expecting people to not be dickbags on the internet is a fool&#39;s errand. That doesn&#39;t mean we should let them run rampant, but it does mean that dealing with them will be a never ending thankless job. If AP can&#39;t handle that job then he should step down. </p>

<p>Whining about how the admins aren&#39;t personally attending to his problems just comes off as immature and petty. The admins have given us the tools to deal with the assholes ourselves; since they&#39;re apparantly too incompetent to hire enough people to take care of it themselves. If you&#39;re getting death threats then report the person to the mods and the admins and then block em. It&#39;s that simple. </p>

<p>No, that doesn&#39;t stop them from harassing other people, but those other people can do the same thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, as do a lot of people here.  If you&#39;ve never been in their crosshairs then I don&#39;t expect you to understand.  Not only do they downvote you here, and make throwaway accounts to harass you here, but they follow you out onto the rest of reddit to harass you there too.  And they do it 24 hours a day non stop so you can fuck off with your lack of personal experience with these psychopaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have the energy (or desire) to spend searching your history for proof.  What I know is that for the last 2+ weeks I have seen several comments from you on TMOR and your alternative sub (can&#39;t remember the name). </p>

<p>I&#39;m not here all that often, and certainly don&#39;t follow you around, so perhaps you are technically correct in saying you have &quot;kept the majority of stuff&quot; in your own sub - but if that&#39;s the actual case, you&#39;ve been talking about TMOR <em>a lot</em>.</p>
