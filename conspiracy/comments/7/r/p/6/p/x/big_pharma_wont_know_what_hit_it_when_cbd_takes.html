        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In my eyes, the prescription drug mafia that Big Pharma has been able to entrap today&#39;s medical feild can indeed have negative effects along with their positive scientific breakthroguhs. In fact, I believe that once goverment authorities realized the medical potential behind cannabinoids such as CBD, they have been strugling to &quot;clean their tracks&quot; every since. This medical potential includes aleviating the sometimes painful symptoms of diseases such as Parkinsons&#39;s Disease and Epilepsy. 
There have been tons of studies out within the last decade or two that have provided more than enough information in order to back up the theory behind using CBD, or cannabidiol, for medicinal purposes. 
The only good thing is that it is still able to be accessed in all 50 states, whether medical marijuana is legal there or not, as long as the CBD that is purchased was derived from hemp and not marijuana.
One may ask themselves, &quot;What&#39;s the difference behind hemp and marijuana?&quot; Well, in short, they are both part of the genus Cannabis, but differ in concentrations of CBD and THC. THC, the classic psychoactive chemical compound that produces the &quot;high&quot; when it interacts with the body&#39;s endocannabinoid system, is found in high concentrations amongst marijuana strains. Hemp tend to be much more heavier on the CBD side of things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh still prefer the CBD from cannabis plants. Hemp CBD just doesn’t seem to work the same without the THC. They truly do work together synergistically. It’s about balance, not one or the other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. But it&#39;s not just thc that works synergistically with CBD, there are lots of cannabinoids and terpenes that seem to get left out from hemp derived CBD. I could tell by the taste, hemp-derived CBD tastes like hay. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fully agree.</p>

<p>All these dumb extraction companies are taking the terpenes out and selling clear pure THC only. While you can get a decent high from this, you lose most of the medicinal benefits. </p>

<p>I’m also a fan of THCA, which is mostly nonpsychoactive. You get a lot of the medicinal benefits and anti-inflammation properties without the high. </p>

<p>1:1 CBD to THC is still my favorite though, CBDa, CBD, THCa, and THC is also a wonderful more whole plant like experience.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I bought some awhile back as a last hope for my 17 year old pup who was having a tough go with arthritis. Unfortunately it didn&#39;t seem to help him and I had to have him put to sleep anyways. I tried it myself to see if I noticed any effects but didn&#39;t. Maybe cbd from cannabis is better, but I don&#39;t live in one of those states so wasn&#39;t able to give that a try.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CBD is on the list to get criminalized. some big pharma company is gonna come up with their own CBD pill, probably lab-created, and will push the government to outlaw OTC sales of CDB. </p>
