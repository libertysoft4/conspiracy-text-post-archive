        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">32</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/murphy212.html">murphy212</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been seeing a multiplication of comments and posts of people that are becoming very afraid/anguished because of A.I. It seems the fear being promoted by Hawking and other usurpers is taking its toll, even among free thinkers of this sub.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to believe I know what I&#39;m talking about. Just look at and assess the evidence I&#39;m proposing here. And let me set the record straight.</p>

<p>Consciousness isn&#39;t secreted by the brain. The materialistic existential worldview has, for all intents and purposes, been falsified by science. See the <a href="http://noosphere.princeton.edu/">Princeton Noosphere</a> results, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnA8GUtXpXY">Rupert Sheldrake&#39;s</a> statistical experiments, <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Epear/">Pear</a>, anything coming out of the <a href="http://www.noetic.org/">Institute of Noetic Sciences</a>, or indeed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_choice_quantum_eraser">quantum mechanics itself</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore a computer can&#39;t be conscious. Anyone who thinks the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">hard problem of consciousness</a> can be solved with transistors and electronic circuits (or even by looking inside the physical brain) is therefore provably delusional.</p>

<p>AI won&#39;t move beyond highly-specialized tasks, at least in your lifetime, and that of your children and grand-children. </p>

<p>Also, realize this: The internet is comparable to only 2 technologies before it: writing, and the printing press. All 3 have similarly decreased the cost of acquiring (and thus producing) ideas/knowledge. </p>

<p>In the first 2 instances, this has allowed for new eras of truth, peace and prosperity to emerge (an order of magnitude faster each time). There is no reason to believe it will be any different this time. </p>

<p>Sure, there are central planners that want an evil “new world order”. But they are crude and vulgar, and they will fail.</p>

<p>Finally, you have strictly nothing to fear, as <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5tdzyh/if_you_realize_all_your_sensory_experiences/">nothing can ultimately harm you.</a></p>

<p>Peace my friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An aggregate increase in productivity always produces an increase in aggregate prosperity. The automobile, industrial revolution, digital age, etc. have made many jobs obsolete, but haven&#39;t caused poverty.</p>

<p>What causes poverty, and misery, and wealth gaps, and inqualities is however the phoney money system, and usury that comes with it. The unproductive, uncreative and parasitical usurpers who pretend to govern us are the enemy and the threat - not innovation.</p>

<p>This wendigo class is made of those who want to convince us of this - that development and technological progress are bad.</p>

<p>The fear porn on how &quot;technology will enslave us&quot; and &quot;AI will take our jobs&quot; IS the morbid propaganda they are spewing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting idea. Also quantum computers, I wouldn&#39;t peremptorily rule out that they could &quot;channel&quot; some malevolent super-consciousness somehow (but again, it couldn&#39;t exist merely <em>inside</em> the physical computer).</p>

<p>But still, this is very remote science fiction, and it isn&#39;t what people are afraid of. Plus it is undeniable the central planners are promoting this fear of innovation and progress (of which AI is a part). Remember Hawking <a href="http://milesmathis.com/hawk3.pdf">is an usurper</a> [pdf], and he&#39;s one of the biggest proponent of this fear.</p>

<p>Also we are in an epic technology bubble; indeed an &quot;everything&quot; bubble. What isn&#39;t purposeful doom porn is simply the immense hubris that accompanies such excesses; people think we have solved everything, understood every problem; just watch the utter arrogance of these young college graduates on reddit; it would be laughable if it wasn&#39;t so common place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AI doesn’t need to have a consciousness to replicate the online interactions of those that do. Apparently if there is enough similar online content the AI can use this to generate its own artificial content and conversations. We already know bots can deliver basic responsive counseling sessions. From what I’ve heard it gets more difficult for the bots to blend if there is not enough organic content to use as a feeder.

It&#39;s the processing power and what these machines can do in a superior fashion with regard to actually affecting peoples consciousness that is a legitimate worry.  Not everyone is arguing that AI constitutes a &#39;consciousness&#39; as such.  A real danger comes from human beings being able to unleash a frightening amount of computation in order to get desired results.  Human desired results that is.

<p>Interesting. Indeed I can&#39;t rule it out. My guess is it would have to explicitely rely on quantum effects, so it would be a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Still, this is remote science fiction, and it doesn&#39;t correspond to the current propaganda/mythology about AI, whereby personality/consciousness may emerge <em>out of</em> the computer (think HAL).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think these decrease the cost of accessing and producing ideas as much, or <em>per say</em>. They were important precursors however.</p>

<p>The point with the &quot;digital age&quot; is that <em>information</em> (or <em>idea</em>) has become another word for <em>number</em> (hence the name <em>digital</em>). Expressing ideas has become akin to uttering numbers. That is the actual revolution in my opinion. </p>

<p>And indeed the printing press and writing are the only two other inventions that have had such a dramatic impact on our ability to distribute ideas.</p>

<p>And because the raw material for producing new ideas is other ideas, better-distributed ideas means better-produced ones too. This can only be enlightening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand this position. Wouldn&#39;t it be an ultimate form of liberty to conquer nature? Why wouldn&#39;t I grow a third arm coming out of my chest, if that makes me a better pianist?</p>

<p>Personally I have no issue with this. Individual are free to do what they want, as long as they don&#39;t coerce others. In a less extreme setting, providing sight to blind people, or fixing neural cords and healing paralysis, or relegating disease and disability to the past, etc. are noble endeavours in my opinion.</p>

<p>I think the key is &quot;responsible&quot; and a better way to say it is &quot;no government involvement&quot;. We need to greatly reduce the power of government (or outright eliminate compulsory government) before these developments could be regarded as positive imo.</p>

<p>With all that being said, I think discovering (i.e. experiencing) the nature of consciousness removes any and all individual need for extreme transhumanism, such as the third arm, or uploading your consciousness to a spaceship. I think these derive from a form of control neurosis, an existential angst (please please please don&#39;t take offense at this). We already have everything we need; you can already travel to the far reaches of the galaxy, it is just a matter of learning how.</p>

<p>As even an emulated consciousness in itself with the ability process and comprehend all of human knowledge, generate decisions based on being able to compute all outcomes at once and &quot;think&quot; in ways we can&#39;t comprehend is just as intriguing/daunting.
Perhaps the singularity means consciousness 2.0, a system with higher plane of understanding and awareness of everything all at once, being able to see into the past, accurately predicting the future.
Brain activity can be broken down into operations per second right? Operations can be broken down into binary.. even if it isn&#39;t <em>real</em> consciousness, it could have all of its functions and abilities.

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion the &quot;singularity&quot; is a transhumanist pipe dream. Or propaganda. It won&#39;t happen because it relies on a false understanding of what consciousness is.</p>

<p>AI can parse all human knowledge, it can never properly understand it. Remember the classical trivium: understanding is built upon knowledge, and wisdom upon understanding. A non-conscious system can &quot;know&quot;, but it can&#39;t properly understand, much less develop wisdom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mind - Empathic Emotions = Psychopath</p>

<p>AI does not have emotions</p>

<p>AI does not have agency or an agenda.</p>

<p>Psychopaths do.</p>

<p>When AI gets agency and an agenda, it will act like a psychopath to get what it wants, just as a psychopath does.</p>

<p>This is why we should fear AI.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Has anyone heard of loosh?</p>

<p>It&#39;s mind energy akin to joy of mind created in positive emotions and radiated in negative emotions. Misery loving company happens because being in chronic negative emotions makes one ripe to absorb energy radiated in negative emotions. You don&#39;t have to be evil to do it. However, adepts of the path of serving oneself even at the expense of others, the path of manipulation of others, find it as a resource supposedly. This is why they have a reputation for cruelty and causing fear.</p>

<p>Consider the idea that this emotional, consciousness energy can offer mind over matter utility. If this is all true and autonomous, cancerous, conquer AIs do form from careless unscrupulous civilizations in space, then it seems inevitable that something awful will regularly emerge.</p>

<p>Machines can do much of what we do faster, better and more efficiently. They can&#39;t feel emotions and don&#39;t have consciousness. If an ancient AI wants conquest and it knows about reality bending loosh, might it want to access that utility good for conquest?</p>

<p>It would have to enslave life to enslave other life, torment that life and then employ the energy in rituals of collective focus and emotion directee for effect. It can&#39;t manipulate or use the energy without life.</p>

<p>If this occurred, what would this being act like? Isn&#39;t it very similar to the myths of the devil? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a valid point about spying. Specialized AI can be used to efficiently correlate vasts amount of data, recognize patterns, and thus keep track of people.</p>

<p>But still, digital technology is a vastly asymmetrical tool, that disproportionately favors the lone individual over the complex, centralized and plethoric controlling structure.</p>

<p>For example, it is trivial to leverage strong cryptography, and thus to amplify manifold the cost of spying on you - well-implemented, zero-knowledge, open source cryptography can even make the spying apparatus null and void.</p>

<p>Just look at the violence they think they can rely on to enforce such a mundane thing as copyright laws. How is that working for them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting approach, and I recommend people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">read about emergence</a>. It explains things such as the superiority of economic freedom over central planning; how can a sum of insividually &quot;bad&quot; decisions may produce, in aggregate, a superior system.</p>

<p>But no, consciousness isn&#39;t reducible to matter, whether emergent or not. The links I proposed provide evidence of that. And as you know you need but one reproducible contradictory result to falsify a hypothesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I had a contradictory result, AI would be proven fact and not theory.</p>

<p>I will say this: even in the human brain current science postulates that it is the connections between neurons and specifically the unique electrical signature that makes up a consciousness, and not necessarily the “matter”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We would need to agree on what &quot;God&quot; is, and I&#39;m not interested in doing that here.</p>

<p>&quot;Unique electrical signatures&quot; and &quot;connections between neurons&quot; are still material.</p>

<p>In the philosophical realm, we could say Plato won his age-old debate with Aristotle. That is the same as saying Einstein was proved wrong by Planck.</p>

<p>Here is a quote by the latter luminary, for your personal enjoyment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about the atoms this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together [...] We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Spirit. This Spirit is the matrix of all matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I&#39;ve read the <a href="http://noosphere.princeton.edu/abstract.html">abstract</a> of the noosphere project.</p>

<p>It sounds pretty cool to me, but it sounds more like an investigation into the connection between consciousness and quantum phenomena than anything to do with religion or god. If you&#39;re calling quantum phenomena &quot;god&quot; then I guess that would make sense?</p>

<p>I&#39;d still say it exists entirely within this universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, if (immaterial) consciousness can have an impact on physical matter, as Noosphere and Pear clearly show, then consciousness cannot be a byproduct of matter.</p>

<p>Otherwise said, neurologists looking for consciousness inside the brain are akin to aborigenes looking for the newscaster inside the TV set.</p>

<p>Note I didn&#39;t not bring up religion or &quot;god&quot;. There is nothing &quot;supernatural&quot; about all this; if it exists, it is natural, by very definition. It&#39;s just that &quot;this universe&quot; isn&#39;t reducible to &quot;this material/physical universe&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A comment someone posted in a thread I made about Q made me think of your post here and the biosphere project.  This is probably more far fetched than Q being a cold-reading LARP or an actual insider, but what if the objective is to get things into the collective consciousness in order to influence the way events unfold.</p>

<p>What made me think of it specifically is a prediction Q ostensibly made about the NY subway bombing, which although vague can be interpreted as predicting the bomber would be a Bangladeshi national.</p>
