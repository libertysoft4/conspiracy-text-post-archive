<p>One question is who is Russian &quot;bot&quot;? I use the word &quot;bot&quot; in quote marks because I don&#39;t think most of them would be AI, but rather people being paid to post.</p>

<p>Has this sub been hijacked by a government power or am I just being paranoid?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think that happens rampantly on reddit because it is a massive way to exploit individual thread popularity due to the nature of how this website works</p>

<p>i think russians have very little to do with it and i think the manipulation is mostly organic; from humans largely in discord servers</p>

<p>i&#39;d be welcome to being proven wrong but what i&#39;ve seen so far is &#39;russian bots&#39; being the scapegoat, for example twitter removing the demand for fisa declassification from trending (censorship), then news companies finding 5000 &#39;russian&#39; bots in the slew of 1.6++ million authentic engagements, letting them dismiss the outrage entirely</p>

<p>what i have observed is what my original post outlined. sort <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> by controversial daily for a few weeks. you&#39;ll find 2-3 conspiracy posts per day at 0. click the submitter, sort by &#39;submitted&#39;. EVERY post they have submitted will be to this subreddit and ALL of it will be anti GOP. for most of them they will have a few years of intermittent submitted history, often in game of thrones discussion forums or the like, followed by maybe a month hiatus, then nothing but conspiracy posting. i can give you examples tomorrow if you remind me. i was compiling a decently sized list, but i&#39;ve lost it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s expensive but i&#39;m sure it happens daily for front page posts</p>

<p>the cheapest way they do it (they probably pay someone, but this is how it happens)</p>

<p>they have programs that will collect reddit usernames (scrapers)</p>

<p>they then have a huge frequently used password list and will run it through all the usernames they&#39;ve scraped. successful logins are placed in a separate text file they&#39;ll use later. when they have a few thousand successful user:pass combos they can then run that list to upvote a specific post, sometimes with staggered upvoting time to make it seem more organic. sometimes posts will only be boosted +50 or whatever it takes to get front page traction</p>

<p>that seems like it&#39;d be too expensive and detectable, so i really think most of the obviously shilled content is &#39;organic&#39; but now and then you&#39;ll see a horseshit post with 45k upvotes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>after you create a certain amount of accounts it should lock you out of creating anymore for a timed duration. new accounts are often automatically filtered from subreddit participation. feel free to try and make a new account and constructively participate in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. your comment will never show up. you can verify this by clicking &#39;context&#39;, so your comment is highlighted in the comment chain, then logging out. your comment will not be there. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t bot reddit threads, but i&#39;m assuming similar filtration methods exist for upvoting and downvoting. 0 day old 0 karma accounts are easy to filter out. also when they&#39;re going to upvote/downvote manipulate threads, they are switching proxies every account, or every few accounts they cycle to avoid IP based detection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So create an account and wait. </p>

<p>Now to address the fact you&#39;d prefer to try and discredit me at the top of your post:</p>

<p>yeah, you obviously didn&#39;t go too deep into my account. There&#39;s stuff about UFO&#39;s, wasserman shultz, shills, corporate corruption, Donna Brazille, etc.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s a small sub. So if I want to see it go somewhere I have to provide most of the content right now. The new developments that suggest possible conspiracies with regards to the current administration have vastly dwarfed most other conspiracies.</p>

<p>And honestly, I&#39;m sick of seeing very plausible conspiracies crowded out by partisan bickering and wanted to create a space devoted to highly plausible theories. If you look at our sidebar rules, partisan cheering/jeering is strictly prohibited, and despite our small size several comment threads have had to be nuked. Often because of overtly liberal cheerleading that doesn&#39;t actually address the topics at hand.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re welcome to your own opinions, even if they haven&#39;t been given much serious thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>waiting doesn&#39;t solve the karma issue. that is an easy filter method. </p>

<p>also that was less to discredit you, but more to give an example of the type of poster you&#39;ll find when you filter by controversial. what i&#39;m primarily talking about is STRICTLY <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> submitted content. i&#39;ve never seen another account posting to your subreddit, but it mirrors what i&#39;ve been finding in this subreddit lately. there is almost ALWAYS a few month hiatus from a normal engagement pattern then post history becomes nothing but <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>i don&#39;t care about your political affiliation or motivations, but there is an active attempt to turn this subreddit partisan through inorganic means and it will be exposed</p>

<p>I think if you believe that it&#39;s because they are pushing a partisan agenda that your victim complex is showing. </p>

<p>They give to both parties because they don&#39;t give fuck who is in charge, as long as they have influence. But laws require them not to push false narratives supplied by foreign powers, and during the most recent election there&#39;s a lot of evidence to suggest it was tilted towards providing fake news to a conservative audience. The next election might be different. It&#39;s worth combating either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it happens there is more reason for the main benefactors/profiteers of the United States economy keeping control of the pigs at their trough.</p>

<p>They killed most of the unions, sent a ton of production jobs to slave wage labor countries &amp; killed most labor law protections. They have a ton invested in their 
unfair production scheme.</p>

<p>Clinton being elected would only benefit Putin &amp; the Russians.</p>

<p>Not a fan of Trump, but Clinton has had way more evidence of her &amp; Podesta being connected to profiting from Russian energy deals.</p>

<p>The media wouldn&#39;t report on any of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics">This book is required reading for Russia military and intelligence officers.</a></p>

<p>Some of it&#39;s goals would have seemed moon shots ten years ago: Isolate Britain from the rest of Europe. Annex Crimea. Etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s goals for America include:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you could advance towards those goals, with plausible deniability, and minimal repercussions even if outed for a very minimal investment compared to military or standard espionage, would you invest in online disinformation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a shit show. I think there are way more Shareblue, whoever is doing Trumps&#39;s shilling and US/Israeli shills but yes I don&#39;t doubt Russia has is also trying to push narratives as well. I get the feeling it is more of the above though. Russia imo likes to point out how corrupt Washington is. They really don&#39;t have to fabricate shit, just shed light on it. Oh I forgot pharma, fracking and agriculture shills as well. They are magic fucking fairies who poof in and out of the sub when keywords trigger a comment.</p>

<p>Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends, we are glad you could attend, step inside step inside.</p>
