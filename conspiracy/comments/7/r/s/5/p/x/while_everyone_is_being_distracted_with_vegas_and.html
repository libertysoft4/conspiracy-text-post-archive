        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know this post is long, but this matters and it matters now. 
This post is written regarding the 5G Smart Grid/Internet of things that&#39;s being rolled out by every government (and tech giants like Google/Facebook) around the world; even those who seem to be in conflict with each other.</p>

<p>ATT is rolling out 5G VR-WIFI this year. Understand that all previous cellular services were labeled according to their Radio Frequency location on the Radio Spectrum. I.E. 3G = 3GHZ and 4G = 4GHz. This was done deliberately for the purpose of concealing the fact that 5G = 24GHz - 90GHz. That is the millimeter wave (based on length of waves) section of the spectrum. It is classified as Extremely High Frequency Ionizing Radiation. </p>

<p>The compact nature of millimeter waves results in heavy interference from just about everything. This limits the distance a signal can travel as well as being line of sight only. Water molecules in the air for example cause heavy loss in signal strength. The only way to compensate for these issues and still deliver the band width promised with the Internet Of Things, is to have 5G WIFI routers on every telephone pole in the country, in every room of every public building in the country, boosted by every CFL bulb(on the box) and smart meter. Even satellites for those in the sticks. If you are saying to yourself </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Wait a minute, I&#39;m 70% water!&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>then you are asking yourself exactly the right question. </p>

<p>The next question is how the hell do we stop something the white hats don&#39;t think is a problem and are even pushing for. Trump believes in geoengineering and he just put out a statement in December declaring all sorts of things you can only do with 5G to be a national priority. Q nor Trump have in any way mentioned these dangers. I say now, the whole Q phenomenon and its results are just another distraction, like they have done so many times before, this time, so they can pull off the most lethal thing ever done to this planet. </p>

<p>Every living thing is harmed by Ionizing Radiation. As the densely packed waves bounce off cells in your body they cause minor damage, as your body repairs this damage, occasionally the process results in cancer.</p>

<p>It breaks strands of DNA. We are exposed every day to harmful radiation from both natural and man made sources. Unless you live under a cell tower or high power lines, that radiation amounts to a misting in most cases, in order for 5G to work, it will be akin to jumping in the ocean. The reason they put lead a vest on when you get an X-ray is EXACTLY the reason they refused to do any safety testing on 5G</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t need to, they know 24GHz - 90GHz will kill you, especially at the levels of signal saturation required to reach everywhere. Milliwatts per square meter is how they measure Electromagnetic Frequency Exposure and 2.5 is the highest amount reported to be safe as of 2013. </p>

<p>The amount measured when laying a meter on a new ATT residential 5G router was 1800+. Now make that commercial and Imagine the overlap and omni directional bombardment of walking through a mall, school, city street and your 1000+ living room doesn&#39;t seem so bad anymore. This is microwave radiation, they took the device that cooks your food out of the microwave, modified it for data and plan on placing them everywhere. </p>

<p>This is the technology they use at airports that can see through your clothes. They can literally boil the water in your skin. I can only imagine the things they could do to your brain, but it might explain why, for as long as i can remember, there have been zombie movies. </p>

<p>The signal that comes from the transmitters has the ability to send out multiple, seperate, pinpoint focused beams that automatiaclly track every wifi receiving device that comes into its signal range. The military has been using millimeter wave technology for at least fourty years. They just need you, me and everyone else to look the other way while they deploy it. </p>

<p>If we wait until the Internet of things is online it will be too late. Q&#39;s pyramid was setup up to fall exactly how its falling. Trumps faction was given the goods on the old guard in order to get them out of the way. Then use the repercussions to set up everyone to accept the new 5G internet of things. The level of evil/corruption in the old guard was necessary and it served at least three purposes.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Fear and control over the elites for as long at they were needed. </p></li>
<li><p>Easy disposal of the elites and there structure of control once they had served their purpose. </p></li>
<li><p>Getting the public to react so emotionally/viscerally to the child sacrificing stuff.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Combined with the monetary chaos the market manipulation will cause, as well as all the drug/weapon/trafficing garbage, that they will embrace the incorruptible, block-chain secured, D-wave driven, Palantir/IOT fed AI overlord as new supreme being/god/ruler. Crypto-currency builds the block chain, the block chain is the neural network of the global Artificial General Intelligence. AGI is the one they make all the scary movies about. The crypto currency is also the best trap imaginable for getting people to buy in to the system. I.E. You have 2 million in crypto that can only be accessed as a member of our system. That&#39;s the reason for the war on cash, once currency exist only in the system, you have no choice but to join the system or attempt to exist completely and utterly outside of it which will be made illegal shortly after the system comes online. </p>

<p>Regardless of method, they will find a way to get enough people accept the system that those who don&#39;t, won&#39;t be missed. None of us have ever heard the names of those who give the elites their orders. The elites live in total fear of these beings as their families have made bargains with them for millennia and they understand the true nature of what I call the Hidden Hand. They have been called many things by many people for as long as there is recorded history.  Fallen angels if you are Christian or Luciferian. Satan presented himself as a serpent that could talk and walk upright in the Garden of Eden and reptilian is still one of the most enduring theories.</p>

<p>Every ancient culture we have records from show some sort of God/s that interacted with them. Once the population of the planet reached a point that they could no longer control it with direct, individual based fear, a new method of domination became necessary.</p>

<p>At this point they decided to rewrite all of human history as the first step in separating humanity from the God/Creator/Source/Light whatever you choose to call it. If you do not believe in creation/reincarnation, then I point you to DNA.  It is incomprehensibly more powerful, both as a computer and as a storage device then anything we have imagined at this point in our evolution. Evolution is the natural process of creation adapting to its environment in order to thrive, exactly the way the DNA was designed to do. Every human emotion can be traced back to just two base emotions, Love and fear. Love is from &quot;God&quot; (you) and it is the meaning of life. </p>

<p>Your purpose, as the highest intellect on this planet, a human being with unlimited potential and the ability to do help or harm, is to show Love to every other living thing in existence. The molecular structure of water is affected by words written on pieces of paper and taped to the outside of the bottle. Beautiful snowflake like structures for kind words, amorphous cancer looking structures for mean words. Words, thoughts and emotions have the power to affect the physical world and again, we are 70% water. The Hidden Hand exist and operate in direct opposition to, and resentment of, &quot;God&quot;. It doesn&#39;t matter in the slightest if you believe in God or Lucifer...</p>

<p>...THEY DO! They always have and they act upon that belief. Fear, suffering and despair is their desire for the creation they despise. They have turned our existence into a farm for that fear. Differences between humans, both real and imagined is their seed. How is it that countries that sanction, sabotage, spy on and go to war with each other, have no problems what so ever sharing any and all info about things like CERN and all agree that geoengineering our atmosphere is the only way to go? The differences created by them shape our emotions and beliefs so powerfully that it is accepted in every country with a military, for the young people to go kill or be killed based solely on the discretion of the government.</p>

<p>How many wars do we now know were started with a false flag or under false pretenses?
The final act in the play is to turn the Earth into an artificial existence that nothing can survive unless it has been modified from its original form in order to do so. Everything with DNA in it is going to be bombarded in the microwave hell they are creating. The final nail in man kinds coffin and the only way to survive the system is going to be through genetic modification/trans-humanism. Once we &quot;jack in&quot; to the system, the system will control our memories, emotions and thoughts and we will no longer have any memory of what life was like before the system. </p>

<p>Pretty much every president has been used as a wedge to drive apart the American people. And the last one that didn&#39;t ended up with a bullet through the head. The last two presidents have been atomic wedgies in that regard. If you don&#39;t have things that have made you question Trumps motives, you are not paying attention. Environment, geoengineering, oil, fracking, Goldman Sachs, Zionist, selling weapons. And please don&#39;t wait any longer for someone with big words like Trump to show up... Seriously, his motivations, the end of corruption, saving the children, all these bad guys being taken down, all of it is meaningless if the 5G/VR-WIFI/IOT is allowed to come online. Please look around, the whole planet is sprinting toward the system and its completely separate from everything Q related.﻿</p>

<p>If there&#39;s anyone who managed to have an attention span longer than that of a goldfish, it&#39;s time to realize YOU are the solution. The solution lies within yourself and it&#39;s not going to come by voting for the next puppet in 2 years. Educate yourself on the 5G Smart Grid that&#39;s being rolled out. Do whatever you can and want to spread the information. Even copying this post and spreading it around will help.</p>

<p>Anyways, for the few that made it to the bottom of this post, here&#39;s a few links to help you start off. (and somewhat of a TL;DR I guess)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem isn&#39;t with the technologies, they could be great for us. The probem is that these technologies are being introduce on their ability to generate more income; to work more efficiently... Rather than the true benefits they hold.</p>

<p>For instance, a specimen that can work 18 hours a day;a specimen that is sterile; that will never have the responsibility of caring for others. 
A specimen that is even tempered with a narrow predictable range of expression. All this is enhanced - improved.</p>

<p>They won&#39;t diagnose it. They will give me any disease I&#39;d like, or a psychiatric disorder if I prefer it and as many painkillers as I&#39;d like, which do not help.  But they never told me I could turn off the router and turn off the pain.   Which is a fact!  Now I&#39;m cured because some conspiracy theorist got me thinking about electromagnetic frequencies and I turned off the radiation I was giving myself!   Now I have energy, was fatigued, no headaches, used to have headaches every day.  I can sleep well, that&#39;s good, and not in pain.  Guess what I did then, I went over to my Mom&#39;s house and made her turn off the wifi, suddenly she can sleep, she&#39;s not in pain during the night.  All fucking night, I thought I was going to die for years.  Just look around for a minute, I don&#39;t know how old you are but things are a lot different then they used to be.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a reptilian dictating these changes, but human beings are notorious for falling into folly like this.  Anyways, there are a lot of people suffering from pain, just blanket pain.  The doctors are not allowed to say anything their field doesn&#39;t teach them, even if they know, they can&#39;t say it or they could be sued for malpractice.  They&#39;re not allowed to tell you, just like they can&#39;t tell you to be a vegan and your allergies will go away.  You&#39;re acne will go away, your erectile dysfunction will go away if your not sitting in radiation.  They&#39;re not allowed to say anything, the government&#39;s done no testing, and frankly I&#39;ll bet they&#39;re not even allowed to notice.  It&#39;s like dentists putting mercury in people&#39;s mouths, they are not allowed to say anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. I agree with a lot you have written. Ultimately it&#39;s my view that we are here to understand polarity. Everything is polarity in this dimension. Good bad night day. Etc. If we take the long view ie Indian cosmology and the yugas we understand that the whole thing is cyclical. If we look at Hancock at al&#39; s research into ancient civilisation and a deeper knowledge we know the ancients forewarn us of this fact. This is our age. There is no escaping that fact. The one thing that meditation and any spiritual practice teaches you is that the battle within is the battle without. We have to look deep into ourselves in order to heal our ourselves and our heritage. You talk of DNA. DNA is the physical expression of all that has been and all that there can be. It is holistic in that every decision you take, every thought you have is both recorded within and actualized  without. It is consciousnesses expression - we all have to search ourselves in truth if we are to free ourselves from the wild oscillation that is polarity consciousness. When you remove yourself from mind and harmonise the frequency that is you all questions cease and polarity is seen for what it is - a beautiful expression of life. Om.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It certainly fits. But I really don’t think it would be any different no matter which candidate was in. We have to constantly keep in mind that the top folks are nothing but puppets. I’m not sure there’s much anyone can do to steer the path once TPTB get the ball rolling on new plans. We can certainly try to keep as many people as possible informed. In that, upvotes for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>4g does not mean 4ghz. 5g does not mean 5ghz. There are a range of frequencies used for 4g and 5g. Look at it on Wikipedia. If I remember right 5g will operate on frequencies well above 20ghz and 4g currently operates less than 20ghz but higher than 1ghz. GSM (3g I believe?) operates at about ~900mhz. </p>

<p>You made some good points but you must get your facts straight about the tech if you really want to be taken seriously. Mind you, what is listed may not be the exact numbers but I encourage you to check out the wiki or an FCC database to find the real numbers. In fact, once you find out the real numbers, 5g should scare you even more. In order to get good range at that high of a frequency the power output must increase which could potentially increase the chance of harmful side effects in human or animal life. It&#39;s not ionizing but if the power output is high enough it could definitely damage tissue. </p>

Being subjected to  controlled frequencies and vibration will trap our minds and keep us from unlocking our spiritual and loving nature. Even that will be impossible soon.

    <div class="md"><p>Electromagnetic and radiation shielding takes many forms depending on the specific part of the electromagnetic spectrum or nuclear particles being shielded against. </p>

<p>For electromagnetic shielding its a Farady cage made of copper or other conductive metals in layers, depending whether its an MRI machine, supercomputer, SCIF, that needs the shielding.</p>

<p>For nuclear materials or shielding from neutrons, protons, or nuclei or gamma and X ray ionizing radiation, you need lots of mass and dense shielding, although sometimes boron capture for neutrons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>😂 i am well aware of where the visible spectrum lies with respect to microwaves.</p>

<p>Visible light interacts with the human body differently than microwaves do, and even differently within the relatively small band of visible light. For example, visible blue light around 440nm or shorter wavelength causes ROS formation in human tissue(which is why its used in ance therapy), and also causes a process called rhodopsin mediated photoreversal in the retinal pigment epithelium, causing eye damage. Longer wavelengths do not.</p>

<p>Just like the long wavelength 4G signals compared to the bands used for 5G. 5G interacts with body tissue differently. I am not aware of 2.4GHz cell signals causing cataracts but the up to 80GHz 5G will use has been demonstrated to.</p>

<p>So before you say something even stupider, go read up on the subject or take some basic physics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Straight from Apple legal on iphone..radiofrequency exposure (RF EXPOSURE type of rardio and microwave exposure)</p>

<p>iPhone has been tested and &quot;meets applicable limits&quot; for radio frequency (RF) exposure.</p>

<p>Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) refers to the rate at which the body absorbs RF energy. The SAR limit is 1.6 watts per kilogram in countries that set the limit averaged over 1 gram of tissue and 2.0 watts per kilogram in countries that set the limit averaged over 10 grams of tissue. During testing, iPhone radios are set to their highest transmission levels and placed in positions that simulate uses against the head, with no separation, and when worn or carried against the torso of the body, with 5mm separation**</p>

<p>To reduce exposure to RF energy, use a hands-free option, such as the built-in speakerphone, the supplied headphones, or other similar accessories. Cases with metal parts may change the RF performance of the device, including its compliance with RF exposure guidelines, in a manner that has not been tested or certified.
Although this device has been tested to determine SAR in each band of operation, not all bands are available in all areas. Bands are dependent on your service provider’s wireless and roaming networks.</p>

<p>How about those 5g cell towers how much RF are they letting off??

    <div class="md"><p>There is a conspiracy to hide the health effects of 5G, which jumps from the 2.4GHz range to 10s of GHz with provisions up to 80GHz. </p>

<p>It also uses mini cell towers that have much shorter range because the higher frequencies are absorbed by water, including the water in foliage and animals as well as atmospheric moisture. As a result, 5G will use beamforming antennas and a lot more cell towers, with transmitters being put on buildings and utility poles since they basically require LOS to work well.</p>

<p>The power levels youre exposed to from cell towers thousands of feet away are nothing compared to walking by cell transmitters at ground level constantly. They have done studies that show cellular damage, immune dysregulation, cataracts and a host of other health problems associated with the RF that 5G uses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rofl.</p>

<p>First of all - G means generation, not the frequency...so:<br/>
1G - NMT; 450 MHz and 900 MHz<br/>
2G - GSM; 900 MHz and 1800 MHz<br/>
2.5G - GPRS, EDGE; 900 MHz and 1800 MHz<br/>
3G - UMTS; 900 MHz and 2100 MHz<br/>
3.5G - HSDPA, LTE; 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz<br/>
4G - LTE-A; 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1800 MHz   </p>

<p>Maybe something is missing because i&#39;m writing from memory. That&#39;s how it is/was in Europe...i think your CDMA stuff isn&#39;t too different. Newer generations will use the same frequencies because carriers need to pay for using frequencies; that&#39;s why EU started abandoning the 2100 MHz band. Base station locations also cost money so they&#39;ll likely just upgrade hardware to support newer standards.</p>

<p>Second - the higher the frequency, the lower the reach. That&#39;s why an AM radio station in kHz range can cover a whole continent and 2.4 GHz 802.11b/g/n wifi can cover an apartment...5 GHz 802.11a/n/ac has even a lower reach. A high frequency like 24-90 GHz would literally need to have transmitters in every room (it cannot penetrate walls) and it would stop working if you accidentally walked through the transmitter-receiver antenna&#39;s line of sight.  </p>

<p>For everything else...sorry, i didn&#39;t read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you want the news to state &#39;according to scientists 5G is being rolled out&#39; to make it believable? This post isn&#39;t about the god/devil bullshit, the only thing you did is proving you didn&#39;t read it properly. Click the links I wrote down at the bottom and see it for yourself, you don&#39;t have to. You&#39;re free to go back and wait for Trump to drain the swamp. He said he&#39;d do it, thus it&#39;s going to happen. Q anon told us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, the 5G is not good.  Even the 2.4 GHz, same frequency as the microwave, routers clocking a high wattage.  No one&#39;s going to test their home router because an acoustimeter costs 300 dollars.  If you don&#39;t believe this person try it on yourself.  Go to your house and turn off your router for a while, get a cable if you can&#39;t disconnect.  Turn it off while you sleep, if you have mercury amalgam fillings in your head, TURN THAT SHIT OFF NOW.   </p>

<p>Watch the anxiety disappear, feel warm fuzzy feelings again, like a sense of well being.  Headaches, body aches if things are really bad, should stop.  Something as simple as this, no need to read the entire internet to find out if it&#39;s true or not, you can just simply test it out and see if it&#39;s true, for yourself, and then you&#39;ll know. </p>

<p>What I do now is radiation reduction since I have metal in my head, I know I&#39;m an antenna, so I have to turn off the WiFi while I sleep.  I adjusted the settings so when my devoted loved one needs to use the ipad, it&#39;s only on at 25% blast.   There are smart meters, and surrounding WiFi, and I&#39;m looking to the future to try to coat my walls, or move out of the city.   </p>

<p>In my city the 5G towers are already up about every 3K feet in shopping areas, and the 5G panels are on top of many buildings.  All the apartment buildings downtown, and every building that I know of that accepts section 8.  There are much larger arrays in the poorer neighborhoods.  Then there was a really sad one at a seniors with disabilities independent living place.  The thing that bothers me most about this is the amount of pain people are going to be in.  I don&#39;t know if anyone has experienced chronic pain, but it&#39;s something you wouldn&#39;t wish on anyone.   Get yourself prepared to protect yourself if you ever want to feel well again, or feel good vibes.  </p>

<p>On a lighter note I made a repulsor, put it over my heart all day, (a few magnets taped with their north faces touching, tape them together in the way they don&#39;t want to go, it theoretically creates a magnetic field) and it felt great.  I have been using this in front of my face because there&#39;s something weird at my job.  I use it and don&#39;t get headaches anymore.   Don&#39;t just call me a liar, try this for yourself and prove it to yourself if it&#39;s true or not this time. </p>

<p>Everyone thinks this is so crazy, well maybe I agree.  But I hate pain, I&#39;m just saying this so that if someone else is feeling the pain they can cure themselves otherwise I wouldn&#39;t because I also hate social scrutiny.  Good luck guys!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t know that, but the point is, there is a tragedy unfolding before our eyes, the advent of 5g really may be the nail in the coffin that locks everyone into the slave system to the point where there is no escape barring absolute self sufficiency off the grid. Being subjected to  controlled frequencies and vibration will trap our minds and keep us from unlocking our spiritual and loving nature. Even that will be impossible soon. Full and global control is the agenda. As someone who has dreamt of having children, I cannot rightfully bring a child into this world of indoctrination, and inescapable control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>😂 i am well aware of where the visible spectrum lies with respect to microwaves.</p>

<p>Visible light interacts with the human body differently than microwaves do, and even differently within the relatively small band of visible light. For example, visible blue light around 440nm or shorter wavelength causes ROS formation in human tissue(which is why its used in ance therapy), and also causes a process called rhodopsin mediated photoreversal in the retinal pigment epithelium, causing eye damage. Longer wavelengths do not.</p>

<p>Just like the long wavelength 4G signals compared to the bands used for 5G. 5G interacts with body tissue differently. I am not aware of 2.4GHz cell signals causing cataracts but the up to 80GHz 5G will use has been demonstrated to.</p>

<p>So before you say something even stupider, go read up on the subject or take some basic physics.</p>
