I remember when he used to do his episodes  “joe Rogan questions everything” with Duncan trussell. Now he denies and dismisses anything that isn’t cnn approved. He had the meta bunk guy on, and in the most recent Danica Patrick episode when she was talking about signing a contract during mercury retrograde he went on to say how much nonsense that is. </p>

<p>What happened? Was he threatened? Was he given an offer he couldn’t refuse? He used to give me so much hope now I can barely stand listening to him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What i have learned from visiting this sub for 5 years ( guessing but im sure at least that) , is that users , like myself , got a certain buzz or dopamine release from the discovery of indignancy im our world. This puts people in the frame of mind ( and  i see it here today, more and more) that people wish there to be a conspiracy to explain everything. The worst part for me is when relationships i have with my family, girlfriend ( though she is of a similar frame of mind) and friends began to deteriorate. I had to accept reaponsibility for this because it was affecting my mood, much like other habit forming , chemical releasing addintive behaviours can. It affected how i sawnthe world and made me unhappy, and made me waste loads of my fucking time. Look, i an writing this , not to discourage people from the path to truth, but to share my personal experience , and to offload and verbalise , in a subreddit that opened my eyes, but then fixated them. 
This post sparked my interest today as i occasionally flip back to this /r to keep in touch with things. I have learned to chill out though. I went from being amazed, ( in the initail days for me it was the late michael ruppert), to angry, to a combination of depressed and obsessed. It became dangerous to my health both socially and mentally. 
I would like to tale this opportunity to ask people to exercise their critical thinking skills but also to ask, what is important here. Is it the overarching narrative? Is it the minutia or unverified data and congecture? Or am i simply getting a dopamine hit from hearing how fucked over we are, and justifying my current state
Of apathy. 
  I am not saying i domt believe. . I can say with reasonable level of certainty, if not total certainty that elite groups of individuals are cocking up the world, and wreeking havoc as tbey have been for time immemorium. Am i going to change that by reading 30
Stories an evening and trying to piece it together? Probably fucking not. I like to juggle these days. I enjoy a joint and to work hard physically. I really stopped with all this when i began to travel. I didnt have the fucking time. I was picking cherries at 4 am and livingmin a barn in canada, or working weed farms or fucking lying by a lake somewhere with fuck all money and a big spliff. I escaped from this never ending , reloading maze of distraction ,which leads OP and others to not even be able to enjoy their normal
Stuff , like an innocent podcast, or convos that dont involve some level of consiratorial conjecture. It was time i got this off my chest. I became happier when i stopped lookingninto the abyss. I write a diary now of things i do in a day abd what to do tomorrow. I juggle. I write songs, i worl on my kood proactively. I still get called a tinfoiler by my friends. A badge i wear with dignity and pride because impo  it takes a snart mind to break free and question, but now i know a wiser one to start at home ( figuratively speaking) to change this world. Its the system thats broken. Its important to remember that unless you have a degree of empathy for yourself and the world around you, you will always look at it with more and kore contempt, and you will have solved nothing. 
I wish you all well. and again , i am not saying this is everyones experience. Some people will maybe even think im a shill😧. We all know things are fucked but dont give up hope in the things you love. Live life and be happy. A good day to you all x </p>

Why is he a sell out because he changed his mind? People change their minds all the time on shit. I don’t believe in Santa anymore does that make me a shill? He doesn’t believe in flat earth and he thinks we went to the moon. So what 90% of the population believes that. He’s not a sell out he doesn’t have to sell out! He’s made all his money doing his own thing like calling UFC fights and his podcast. He does what he wants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought yours was a good take.  Shouldn’t be downvoted.  I think some members of the audience struggle with people who are only partially in their own camp.  People that blur the lines are often seen as traiters to the cause because they don’t believe the whole rhetoric.</p>

<p>For me personally, I get some cognitive dissonance from him.  Sometimes, he seems incredibly open-minded and you get a bunch of new awesome information, and other times he’s incredibly close-minded and insulting to people with whatever belief he doesn’t share.  Even if I agree with him, I find him abrasive to other people when he gets in that mood, and I don’t want to be around him and I just shut off his podcast and come back later to a different one.  It’s like watching a parent berate their kid in public.  </p>

<p>Wait until you get data caps (monthly cap on data, and pay to go over). Or when you have to shell out an additional $20/month more than you used to just to access Netflix, because your ISP has a deal with Hulu.</p>

<p>And then, when you want to visit your favorite conspiracy website but it won&#39;t load because they didn&#39;t pay your ISP for better access, well you can start your own (inaccessible) website to complain about it.</p>

<p>The reason they came down on one side is simple: the only people pushing for deregulation are the companies that stand to make a profit.</p>

<p>If the ISP&#39;s gave two fucks about competition, they would have built fiber to everyone&#39;s homes instead of pocketing the <em>billions</em> in taxpayer money they received to do so.</p>

<p>The big companies don&#39;t care about you, they only care about profit. The internet was scheduled like all other utilities (phone, electricity, water, gas), and they convinced <em>you</em> that that&#39;s bad.</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re against the internet being scheduled as Title II, then you had better start trying to deregulate your other utilities as well, for the same reason (more competition, etc.).</p>

Do you find it suspicious when someone posts to this sub repeatedly with his own content regardless of revelance particularly when he makes money off said content and also when he doesn’t own his relation to the content. He is also a condescending prick too... and thinks himself better than this sub. So when I run across his posts I let people know who they are arguing with. If you know him let him know that his shilling his own material this site is pathetic, some of his claims are disgusting, his style of argument is inane and he should open a physics textbook once in his iife. Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you give me a specific example? I know him as in have interacted with him in this sub plenty of times before. I&#39;m aware of his flat earth beliefs and while I don&#39;t personally believe in it, I&#39;ll also admit that I&#39;ve never really looked into it that much, so I won&#39;t completely dismiss everything he says because of that one belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Follow him through a few arguments he has on this site. </p>

<p>1) He is shilling his own site. If he said hey, here is a video I made it wouldn&#39;t be an issue. But he relentlessly promotes his own site and videos and only his own site and videos. He tried to post them directly so it did not work, now he goes around this sub trying to inject them into the comments...</p>

<p>2) He makes money off of his site. Not donations, no merchandise but subscription and most of his videos directly promote the paid videos while saying little more than that he will blow your mind.</p>

<p>3) He is condescending when engages in arguments, attacks debaters, moves goal posts, and will  try to hone in on one detail for which he requires extraordinary levels of proof.</p>

<p>4) He does not believe anyone died in the towers on 9/11... which is very insulting to those who lost colleagues, loved ones, partners, children, parents etc. To make things worse he uses these claims to try to push his paid website. </p>

<p>This is ironic because his conjectures do not seem to require such proof. Take the video on media fakery that he spams into most conversations. </p>

<p>It actually his video on how he does not believe missiles are capable of level flight. He injects this into many unrelated conversations. </p>

<p>At the core of his argument is his lack of understanding of how physics work and lack of imagination to realize how control surfaces and vectored thrust works.</p>

<p>When called on this, he will ask for proof. If you post articles and theories on missile control  surfaces then he will claim that its not proof because it is theory and diagrams. </p>

<p>If you post a video of cruise missiles  and SAMs in level flight he claims that the videos do not constitute proof either. </p>

<p>Which would be fine, accept his original conjecture is based on his lack of understanding of physics, engineering and a nasa force diagram of a missle/rocket. </p>

<p>Thus based on his own logic it would mean he could only say he doesn&#39;t know missiles could fly, but instead he shills this video that missiles cannot fly. </p>

<p>On youtube comments why he is wrong was explained to him, on reddit why he wrong has been explained to him, but he just moves goal posts and resorts to ad hominem attacks. </p>

<p>If you note in the youtube comments he mainly responds to and attacks people who he suspects won&#39;t be able to argue back and ignores substantive comments probably because he knows he is wrong. </p>

<p>He then created a response video where starts of by pretending to admit being wrong, but then concludes that its best to stay on his website behind a paywall... this is a common MO for him, try to get people to get interested in his paid content.  </p>

<p>Most of his videos are more agregious, where he does not even present his ideas and facts but instead just sells his website and other videos. This brings me to reason 5 why I dislike him:</p>

<p>5) His videos employ sketchy sales strategies. Why people hate him. How he will blow your mind. Everyone else is wrong but he alone knows the truth Just pay him money and he will change your life... its reminiscent of people hawking diet pills and other vapor ware on infomercials. </p>

<p>Real thinkers and believers let their own ideas and facts do the talking. They don&#39;t try to oversell their content nor take money from others for them. If they do have a paid aspect to their content they make a good faith effort to provide samples of their content. </p>

<p>Basically he is acting in bad faith. It is not clear what he actually believes. He makes fun of &quot;normies&quot; and &quot;conspiritards&quot; alike. He is actively shilling his own content under false auspices. He is promoting his paid content and trying to take advantage of people on this sub. When he argues he acts like an arse and a troll. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The person that replied to you, step2thejep is John le bon and he jsut linked to a video he himself produced. He is trying to promote his paid website ($20+/mo) and his youtube channel so he tries to insert links to conspiracy threads. He exclusively links to his own content. </p>

<p>His views are nonsensical, his style of debate starts by asking some question about one of your points and the he will condescend, move goal posts, demand impossible proof for your points while demanding none for his own,  misapply/ misunderstand science, and link to his own videos. </p>

<p>He himself is a flat earther but since he thinks himself better than people in this sub who he calls &quot;conspiritards&quot; (he has a video about why conspiracy theorists hate him) and &quot;normies&quot; everyone who does not agree with him... so he basically states he is not a flat earther but also doesn&#39;t believe in the earth orbiting the sun, spinning on its axis or being round. </p>

<p>Ask him what he actually believes about the earth and he won&#39;t tell you or link to a nonsensical video or his member only site. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well none of us will know whether he really did &quot;sell out&quot; or not, but it is obvious for those who have listened to him from the start that he treats conspiracy related topics much more conservatively now. Sure people grow and change their viewpoints, he always stated that, and he&#39;s certainly getting old and with family, money and more fame probably just doesn&#39;t have the same curiosity he used to have.</p>

<p>Having said that, I personally feel that he is much less perceptive / sharp in his podcasts and less articulate and thoughtful. I almost feel that the onnit and alpha brain crap he&#39;s peddling is slowly crippling his cognitive functions. </p>

<p>Also on a side note, some of the comedians who knew Rogan from the old days commented on how Rogan was a huge jerk and bully in the past...so people certainly evolve. Sometimes for the better, and sometimes for the worse.</p>

<p>My position has consistently been that he is not known for his conspiracies. Just because that’s how you view/viewed him does not mean that is how the general populace views him. He was becoming a known figure before his podcast even started. </p>

<p>His podcast is popular because he is a funny and entertaining guy. He has clout with celebs and is able to get a wide variety of interesting people on his show. </p>

<p>Some people may also enjoy his views on some controversial subjects like drugs and conspiracies, but I think those are not the reason his podcast is successful. His podcast would be successful regardless of his stance on them, hence, they are superfluous to his fame.</p>

<p>His bio makes all of these pretty self-evident. It’s not like he was a nobody who shot to fame when he started talking about touchy subjects. He was someone who slowly amassed their fame and was already on an upward trend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying someone is “known for” something is a general expression indicating what the general population would recognize about said person, not a statement on every individual’s personal feelings on the matter.</p>

<p>It’s a generalization. For example:</p>

<p>Men are known for being less emotional. </p>

<p>Does that mean no man is more emotional than a woman? Does that mean no man is emotional at all? Of course not. It’s a generalized observation of a larger trend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my answer to your unwritten question. I&#39;ve been thinking a lot lately that most of everything can be explained by criminal levels of incompetence. A conspiracy of deep rooted incompetence, if you will. The google lawsuit, the Hawaii false alarms, and the swatting shooting are some recent smaller examples. Some larger examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The military: See ships smashing ships into each other, the Syria missile attack where several never reached their target, and the last 20 years in the middle east. Aluminum tubes look like WMDs? Don&#39;t double check, must be WMDs!</p></li>
<li><p>Intelligence agencies: If there are massive databases and &quot;lists&quot;, and I&#39;m starting to doubt it, they are being used ineffectually; the FBI has to bait people into crimes to catch them and many more terrorist attacks occur than are prevented. Throw the results of the TSA audits in this pile.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on and on. People want to come up with grand conspiracies to explain things and in doing so invent more bullshit than truth. In my mind three things can explain away nearly every conspiracy theory:</p>

<ul>
<li>people being retarded/ignorance of facts: accepted age of civilization vs gobekli tepe+100000 year study, for example</li>
<li>making up facts/completely full of shit: media coverage of politics, for example </li>
<li>willfully misrepresenting facts for personal gain/scammers: climate change, the paris accord, and $3 billion in payments to foreign counties, for example</li>
</ul>

<p>I mean you could be correct, you could also be wrong. But I wonder what fills you with the need to type out massive responses like this in a conspiracy sub. I imagine it comes from a desire to convince others to think like you. I wonder why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man. I agree with you. Its hilarious that a forum dedicated to the discussion of conspiracies is upvoting a post that is quite literally stating that conspiracies don&#39;t exist at all.</p>

<p>Sometimes I get hooked into an inane back and forth with some stooge here, get extremely frustrated that this is actually a horrible place to reasonably discuss conspiracies, and then wonder why I&#39;m on reddit at all.</p>

<p>Just wanted to say you aren&#39;t alone - there is so much noise here, almost no signal.</p>

Joe looks at the camera and says he would sell out his own grandmother if they approached him and showed him the secrets.  Joe is now a government asset.

Are you going to protect him and he family if he covers the wrong truth and get himself into trouble? He is far to popular to talk about anything damaging the elite power structure. </p>

<p>The thing is that you have to understand the danger of influence. Joe Rogan has one of the most listened to radio shows in the world. Just look at what happened to Ben Swann. Saying the wrong thing when you have listeners can have very negative consequences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he sold out, the dude just tries to cover literally every topic. I&#39;m sure if the opportunity for one comes up, he&#39;ll talk about one, but he&#39;s never been a specifically conspiracy podcast. I know a lot of health nut friends and fitness friends who listen to him, he&#39;s got a wide audience. Which is why it&#39;s awesome that he talks about those subjects at all. But don&#39;t assume that&#39;s ever been his focus, for that you should listen to conspiracy specific stuff. I don&#39;t really listen to every Rogan podcast, I just pick and choose ones based on the subjects that I&#39;m interested in learning about. I still don&#39;t think he&#39;s topped his episode about DMT.</p>

I&#39;ve been watching since episode one and was on his forums before that where basically only conspiracy theories and dicks were discussed. He most definitely set himself up as a guy who didn&#39;t trust TPTB and was insanely passionate about man having not gone to the moon.he has without a doubt done a 180 with no real explanation as to why. Even his best buddy Eddie Bravo sees it and calls him out on it. Come on man ....... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well none of us will know whether he really did &quot;sell out&quot; or not, but it is obvious for those who have listened to him from the start that he treats conspiracy related topics much more conservatively now. Sure people grow and change their viewpoints, he always stated that, and he&#39;s certainly getting old and with family, money and more fame probably just doesn&#39;t have the same curiosity he used to have.</p>

<p>Having said that, I personally feel that he is much less perceptive / sharp in his podcasts and less articulate and thoughtful. I almost feel that the onnit and alpha brain crap he&#39;s peddling is slowly crippling his cognitive functions. </p>

<p>Also on a side note, some of the comedians who knew Rogan from the old days commented on how Rogan was a huge jerk and bully in the past...so people certainly evolve. Sometimes for the better, and sometimes for the worse.</p>
