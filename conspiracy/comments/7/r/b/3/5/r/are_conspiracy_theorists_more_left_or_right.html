<p>The left right paradigm is a feature of our voting system.  And even though it is archaic and kinda dumb, we&#39;ve shown some pretty amazing progress in our 240ish years.</p>

<p>I am in favor of changing the voting system to another model.  I also realize to change this system I have to use this system.  This system mandates two parties so I am certainly going to pick a side and use that to fight for what I want.  You have to pick a side to make the change you want.  </p>

<p>We&#39;re not going to burn it all down.  Accelerationsim is silly.  We work slowly to make change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The system does not mandate two parties though. Our first president gave a strong an serious warning about the two party system and regardless it moved to that almost immediately and has been there to this day.  </p>

<p>It is instilled from a young age that voting for a third party is a waste of a vote.  To be a democrat or a republican is a part of growing up, that should not be the case.  Despite the fact the last election had two of the most hated candidates of all time third parties still got less that 5% of the vote.  By your logic at this pace we should have a contending third party by when? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy Theorists for the most part want to see a fair, transparent and just world. Some of them are unable to model reality and so they will align themselves with political ideology. True conspiracy theorists question everything and decide for themselves the best model and way to actualize a better world.</p>

<p>Your &quot;normal&quot; conspiracy theorist, without any negative connotations, jumped on the bandwagon. More and more conspiracy theorists lack critical thought and are only seeking for someone else to create a model of reality for them in which they can then choose to accept or deny. This is no different from the mass media.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Opinion: Leftward-leaning people who look into conspiracy theories tend to veer rightward (but might not cross &#39;the centre line&#39;); rightward-leaning people who look into conspiracy theories don&#39;t move that much further right.</p>

<p>There are two reasons for this.</p>

<p>1) It is an article of faith among the intelligentsia of the left that conspiracies do not happen, and that such theories are the products of flawed intellects. (I&#39;m not going to back that up, but I promise that you will find it is true of your own accord.) If a left-leaning person starts to look into conspiracies, then they will soon come to reject this article of faith and before long they will start to jettison other left-wing shibboleths and no-nos.</p>

<p>2) The right wing puts a far greater importance on individuality over collectivism, and ascribes far greater significance to incentive-driven behaviour. These concepts are capable of absorbing conspiracy notions without any great intellectual discomfort. (That&#39;s not to say that right-wing people are credulous about conspiracies per se.)</p>

<p>Caveat: &quot;left wing&quot; and &quot;right wing&quot; are a diptichal frame for describing political belief, not a real measure of two sets of values. The &quot;left-versus-right&quot; setup dates from the time of the French Revolution, and the values it represented are now just as outdated, but they serve as a useful way of comprehending <em>party</em> politics, if not the politics of voters themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scale is wacko tin foil conspiracy types vs realistic practical conspiracy types.   For example,   working from proven conspiracies vs going for the sensational stuff that is promoted by cult-like figures.</p>

<p>The left right divide is a charade that is largely cultivated.   I mean the issues upon which polarities are accentuated for the explicit purpose of distracting and dividing people while they get poisoned and ripped off.</p>

<p>Yeah,  there was an older left right divide,  which was about the rich vs the poor,  but that&#39;s gone at least in the US,  the poor are just as likely to vote in a rich bastard,   and the rich are just as likely to give money to Obama or Hillary.    Since the fall of communism in the Soviet Union and the rise of a new wealthier China,   the poor have not been represented by any left political parties anywhere I know of,   except maybe for a while in Venezuela or Ecuador.    And what happened in Iceland when the failed banks were <strong>NOT</strong> bailed out.    Now <em>that</em> was interesting,  but it wasn&#39;t about poor or left,  it was about realistic,   practical people who were interested in a PROVEN CONSPIRACY and thus capable of effective and beneficial action.</p>

<p>The poor were not served all that well by the leftist movements of the past.    The ideology of class warfare or handouts only backfired on them.    Maybe they should take a lesson from Iceland.    All we need is for the game not to be stacked against us and for the corrupt, and the corrupt are really good at ideology.    Follow the money,  don&#39;t listen to those crooks behind the curtain who are rigging the game in their favor in the name of left and right.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a place for crazy conspiracies like flat earth.    When the stakes are high,  that place is really huge:   trolls,  schills,  and disinfo.    Ego freaks and megalomaniacs of the Alex Jones variety who love big media and dream of being at the top of it.    We don&#39;t need more media channels,   we need to follow the key people who are actually in a place where they know what they are talking about.   Keep track of your own list of real experts,   hopefully practical people who are less ideological and more focused on getting the facts.   We all need mentors like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does it matter though? Most of the shit keeping humanity down is the finger that points to the &quot;other&quot; while we still bleed the same color, and continue to pay the opportunists that make fortunes from hedging bets against both &quot;sides&quot;. I can&#39;t calm down. Get off the party line. Stop collecting cards and start making your own decisions. Stupid question, I&#39;m sorry, but damn questions like these come from &quot;useful idiots&quot; not free thinking individuals. Cmon already. </p>

<p>The left right paradigm is a feature of our voting system.  And even though it is archaic and kinda dumb, we&#39;ve shown some pretty amazing progress in our 240ish years.</p>

<p>Would love to see more of a proportional representative system.</p>
