        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>GAIA (Gaea) was the goddess of the earth. She was one of the primoridal elemental deities (protogenoi) born at the dawn of creation. Gaia was the great mother of all creation--the heavenly gods were descended from her through her union with Ouranos (Uranus) (Sky), the sea-gods from her union with Pontos (Sea), the Gigantes (Giants) from her mating with Tartaros (the Pit), and mortal creatures born directly from her earthy flesh.</p>

<p>Gaia was the chief antagonist of the heavenly gods. First she rebelled against her husband Ouranos (Sky) who had imprisoned several of her giant-sons within her womb. Later when her son Kronos (Cronus) defied her by imprisoning these same sons, she sided with Zeus in his rebellion. Finally she came into conflict with Zeus for she was angered by his binding of her Titan-sons in Tartaros. She birthed a tribe of Gigantes (Giants) and later the monster Typhoeus to overthrow him, but both failed in their attempts. Typhon= Satan/ That old serpent/ the great dragon. All of the Titans were imprisoned within Tartaros.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. 2 Peter 2:4 
- For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to hell, and delivered [them] into chains of darkness ...</p>

<p>In the ancient Greek cosmology earth was conceived of as a flat disk encirced by the river Okeanos (Oceanus), and encompassed above by the solid dome of heaven and below by the great pit (or inverse dome) of Tartaros. Earth supported the seas and mountains upon her breast.</p>

<p>Known as the &quot;father of all monsters&quot;, Typhon was a fire-breathing dragon who had one hundred heads that never slept. After the Titanomachy, Gaea wanted to punish Zeus for imprisoning her Titan children in Tartarus; thus, Typhon was born. Neither like the gods nor mortal men, fell, cruel Typhaon, to be a plague to men. The earth created Typhon to be the equal of Zeus, and to over throw him. </p>

<p>There was a great battle in heaven. Zeus swooped down on his Chariot from heaven and struck the great Typhon with lightning bolts. When Typhon hit the earth the entire earth trembled, and shook. Still unable to kill Typhon, so Zeus imprisoned him within Tartaros.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. and the dragon fought and his angels, And prevailed not either was their place found any more in heaven. Angel=messenger, fallen=failed. Fallen angel =failed messenger</p>

<p>Lucifer = Prometheus. The light bearer. He created man, along with his brother, who are now imprisoned within Tartaros. He gave man fire from heaven. Which angered Zeus, cause he didn&#39;t want man to have any advantages to be like gods.</p>

<p>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!</p>

<p>13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit&quot; Hell=Tartaros</p>

<p>The later poets frequently connect Typhoeus with Egypt, and the gods, it is said, when unable to hold out against him, fled to Egypt, where, from fear, they metamorphosed themselves into animals, with the exception of Zeus and Athena.</p>

<p>&quot;[Leto i.e. the Egyptian goddess Buto] taking charge of Apollo [Egyptian god Horus] from Isis, hid him for safety in this island [Khemmis (Chemmis)] which is now said to float, when Typhon [Egyptian god Set] came hunting through the world, keen to find the son of Osiris. Apollon [Horus] and Artemis [Bastet] were, they say,children of Dionysus [Egyptian Osiris] and Isis, and Leto [Egyptian Buto] was made their nurse and preserver; in Egyptian, Apollon is Horus, Demeter Isis, Artemis Bubastis.&quot;</p>

<p>Herodotus, Histories 2. 144. 1 : &quot;Before men, they said, the rulers of Aigyptos (Egypt) were gods, but none had been contemporary with the human priests. Of these gods one or another had in succession been supreme; the last of them to rule the country was Osiris&#39; son Horus, whom the Greeks call Apollon; he deposed Typhon [Set], and was the last divine king of Aigyptos. Osiris is, in the Greek language, Dionysos.&quot;</p>

<p>The reptilian race is not the aliens.  You are not indigenous. Which goes along with the idea that reptilians exist through the ancient dinosaurs that roamed earth.</p>

<p>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made.</p>

<p>If the devil is a dragon, then why does every image we are presented with of the devil appear as a horned goat man? This would be the demonization of the Greek god Pan. This demonization was no accident, but rather a deliberate twisting of pagan ideals as Christianity spread its influence throughout Europe. After the Council of Nicea issued the Nicene Creed and the Roman Catholic Church was established in 325 C.E., Christian theologians (beginning with Eusebius) transformed Pan from a benign nature god to Satan the great Adversary.</p>

<p>Pan is the universal agent known as phosphorus, that gives light and life to the world. In Lévi&#39;s writings, the Baphomet does not only express a historical-political tradition, but also occult natural forces that are explained by his magical theory of the Astral Light. Lévi called his image &quot;The Goat of Mendes&quot;, possibly following Herodotus&#39; account that the god of Mendes—the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt—was depicted with a goat&#39;s face and legs. Herodotus relates how all male goats were held in great reverence by the Mendesians, and how in his time a woman publicly copulated with a goat.</p>

<p>At several places in the Delta, e.g. Hermopolis, Lycopolis, and Mendes, the god Pan and a goat were worshipped; Strabo, quoting (xvii. 1, 19) Pindar, says that in these places goats had intercourse with women, and Herodotus instances a case which was said to have taken place in the open day. The Mendisians, according to this last writer, paid reverence to all goats, and more to the males than to the females, they call both Pan and the goat Mendes, and both were worshipped as gods of generation and fecundity. Diodorus compares the cult of the goat of Mendes with that of Priapus, and groups the god with the Pans and the Satyrs. The goat referred to by all these writers is the famous Mendean Ram, or Ram of Mendes, the cult of which was, according to Manetho, established by Kakau, the king of the IInd dynasty.Lévi called his image &quot;The Goat of Mendes&quot;, possibly following Herodotus&#39; account that the god of Mendes—the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt—was depicted with a goat&#39;s face and legs.</p>

<p>Baphomet is a term originally used to describe an idol or other deity that the Knights Templar were accused of worshipping and that subsequently was incorporated into disparate occult and mystical traditions.</p>

<p>33rd degree Freemason, Manly P. Hall had said in the Secret Teachings of All Ages;“Pan was a composite creature, the upper part–with the exception of his horns–being human, and the lower part in the form of a goat. ” According to Hall, the symbolism of the goat relates to the pre-Christian God Pan, Dionysius.</p>

<p>The Goat-God was accepted by the later Greek Mystery Schools as the symbol of the Temple Builders. In fact, the Dionysian Artificers was such a mystery school. They viewed practical Temple Construction as a source of understanding the mystery of Nature and God; thus being one of the early esoteric schools from which Masonry has inherited certain symbols and teachings.</p>

<p>Another famous 33rd Degree Scottish Rite Freemason, Albert Pike had written in Moral and Dogma, in describing the 28th degree; &quot;The Gnostics held that it [universal agent] composed the igneous [pertaining to fire] body of the Holy Spirit, and it was adored in the secret rites of the Sabbat or the Temple under the hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet or the hermaphroditic goat of Mendes.&quot; Pike further stated; &quot;&quot;... Satan is not a black god, but negation of God ... this is not a Person, but a Force, created for good, but which may represent evil. It is the instrument of Liberty or Free Will. They represent this Force; under the mythologic and horned form of the God Pan; thence came the he-goat of the Sabbat, brother of the Ancient Serpent, and the Light-bearer.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve mixed false Greek mythology with the Abraham religion. </p>

<p>What a inventive way to commit blasphemy.</p>

<p>The Illuminati only exists so that those in power don&#39;t come down from it. </p>

<p>The precept you used about Lucifer falling are the true children of God watching those at the tippy top rebelling against God falling from power.</p>

<p>They worship Baal, a false God of the flesh. Although he has many names, at the end of the day, all false God&#39;s are worship of the flesh. I.E. they worship the matrix.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no coincidence that Taco Bell would promote #belluminati</p>

<p>Or that Rothschild has promoted the Arch of Baal being risen in not one country but two!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>Baal is a name.</p>

<p>Yahawah is a name. </p>

<p>These are two different entities but both can have the title LORD depending on who you are talking to.</p>

<p>Both are Yahawah</p>

<p>7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is talking about True Israel finding out the name of the their God. </p>

<p>Because the prophets of Baal have ruled the world for their period and it is almost over. You have to understand that God gave the world to Satan to punish his chosen people. </p>

<p><strong>Job 9:24King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<p>24 <strong>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?</strong></p>

<p>Get it? The Bible is only meant for the bloodline of Israel. It condems all other 17 nations. </p>

<p>The rulers of this planet know this, so they hide it and worship Satan by worshiping the Matrix, thus completing rebellion against God by worshiping the flesh.</p>

<p>This was Esau&#39;s downfall throughout the entire Bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just like Baal, Satan isn&#39;t a name either. </p>

<p>Satan (Hebrew: שָּׂטָן‎ satan, meaning &quot;enemy&quot; or &quot;adversary&quot;; Arabic: شيطان‎ shaitan, meaning; &quot;astray&quot;, &quot;distant&quot;, or sometimes &quot;devil&quot;) </p>

<p>Therefore by that definition you can replace Satan with simply meaning enemy, or adversary. </p>

<p>So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan</p>

<p>Here the devil , or Satan is the the great dragon/old serpent. Therefore Satan is a dragon, or serpent. Not a fallen angel. </p>

<p>The Devil (from Greek: διάβολος diábolos &quot;slanderer, accuser&quot;) here devil would simply means slanderer, or accuser.</p>

<p>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made.</p>

<p>That would make the serpent a best of the field which the Lord had made. Not a fallen angel.</p>

<p>Fallen simply means failed, and Angel simply means messenger.
Fallen Angel means Failed Messenger.</p>

<p>Now a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars. 2 Then being with child, she cried out in labor and in pain to give birth. 3 And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great, fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads. 4 His tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give birth, to devour her Child as soon as it was born. 5 She bore a male Child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her Child was caught up to God and His throne. 6 Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</p>

<p>The Python used to dwell on Mount Parnassus, in central Greece. Wherever the Python went, it diffused an obnoxious smell and spread mischief and death. Python was once sent out by Hera, the wife of Zeus, in order to chase the pregnant Leto, a lover of Zeus, so that she couldn&#39;t settle anywhere to give birth. Zeus felt sorrow for Leto and transformed her into a quail (ortyx) in order to give birth to their twin children, Apollo and Artemis.</p>

<p>Now when the dragon saw that he had been cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male Child. 14 But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent. And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. 2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon (Apollo).</p>

<p>And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, 8 but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them[a] in heaven any longer. 9 So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</p>

<p>Known as the &quot;father of all monsters&quot;, Typhon was a fire-breathing dragon who had one hundred heads that never slept. After the Titanomachy, Gaea wanted to punish Zeus for imprisoning her Titan children in Tartarus; thus, Typhon was born. Typhon confronted Zeus and in their first battle, managed to repel almost all of the Olympian gods and tear out Zeus&#39; tendons. Hermes managed to get the tendons back and give them to Zeus,. Zeus recovered his strength, he made a sudden descent from heaven on a chariot drawn by a winged horse. Hurling thunderbolts, he pursued Typhon who eventually threw his lightning bolts against Typhon and overwhelmed him. He finally trapped him underneath Mount Etna.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all.</p>

<p>Zeus had raised up his might and seized his arms, thunder and lightning and lurid thunderbolt, [855] he leaped from Olympus and struck him, and burned all the marvellous heads of the monster about him. But when Zeus had conquered him and lashed him with strokes, Typhoeus was hurled down, a maimed wreck, so that the huge earth groaned. But when the blessed gods had finished their toil, and settled by force their struggle for honors with the Titans, they pressed far-seeing Olympian Zeus to reign and to rule over them, by Earth&#39;s prompting. So he divided their dignities amongst them.</p>

<p>The Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes erected a statue of Zeus Olympios in the Judean Temple in Jerusalem.[65] Hellenizing Jews referred to this statue as Baal Shamen (in English, Lord of Heaven).[66]</p>

<p>Dragon , and Lucifer are never mentioned being the same beings in the Bible. The dragon would be Typhon he made war with the gods in heaven, and was cast to the earth. The Olympian gods were not cast to the earth. </p>

<p>Demon-Disembodied spirit, Not a fallen angel. To mate with the daughters of man, and have sex with them, and create children they care about, they would be physical beings. Daemon comes from the Ancient Greek word δαίμων, which originally referred to a lesser deity or guiding spirit.</p>

<p>This is talking about the upcoming war where Edom will gather the armies of the earth to fight Yahawah and Yahawashi who will be coming with the chariots of God as stated in Revelation 1:7 KJV.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation 1:7King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again this is reference to watching the people at the top right now fall so fast it will seem like lightining. Remember it was only for an appointed time that the gentile would rule over Israel.</p>

<p>Because all 17 nations partook in the destruction of Israel, they must be recompensed.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 83King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>83 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.</p>

<p>2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</p>

<p>3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</p>

<p>4 <strong>They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</strong></p>

<p>5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Obadiah 1:15</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.” </p>

<p>Dragon , and Lucifer are never mentioned being the same beings in the Bible. The dragon would be Typhon he made war with the gods in heaven, and was cast to the earth. The Olympian gods were not cast to the earth. Demon-Disembodied spirit, Not a fallen angel. To mate with the daughters of man, and have sex with them, and create children they care about, they would be physical beings. Daemon comes from the Ancient Greek word δαίμων, which originally referred to a lesser deity or guiding spirit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Worship of all other God&#39;s are Satan Worship. There is no if ands or buts about it. Even if it&#39;s a rock, it&#39;s Satan worship because it&#39;s a deception I.E. deceiver I.E. The Devil.</p>

<p>Because you don&#39;t understand history. Before Alexander came from the caves to conquer the world, the Jews (Benjamin/Judah/Levi) spoke Hebrew. They were conquered. The Apocrypha details this. </p>

<p><strong>2 Maccabees 6:8-9</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>8 Moreover there went out a decree to the neighbour cities of the heathen, by the suggestion of Ptolemee, against the Jews, that they should observe the same fashions, and be partakers of their sacrifices:</p>

<p>9 And whoso would not conform themselves to the manners of the Gentiles should be put to death. Then might a man have seen the present misery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Understanding this, it was the <strong>Ancient Jews themselves who translated the Bible into GREEK.</strong></p>

<p>There were two nations of people living in Greece not mention the original Japhites people who were slaughtered when Alexander showed up. One ruled over the other one, Edom over Israel.</p>

<p>You say Baal is Satan, and Devil, so he has 3 titles now, but you have given no name. You say lightning falling from heaven is people in power, losing power? That is really, really reaching so far I can&#39;t see the analogy.</p>

<p>Seeing as Typhon was struck with lightning , and fell from heaven to earth by a literal lightning bolt of Zeus. I would say my analogy is a lot closer.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The serpent is the the left hand of God since it clear that Yahawashi (so called Jesus) sits on his RIGHT HAND.</p>

<p><strong>Acts 2:33</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>God created Satan to try the souls of men, Satan is controlled and created by GOD himself. This is clear in Job. </p>

<p><strong>Job 1:6-9</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</p>

<p>7 <strong>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</strong></p>

<p>8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</p>

<p>9 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see this back and forth here? God knows very well that Satan is his creature and Satan knows that he is a servant of God. Again:</p>

<p><strong>Isaiah 45:7King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why we see people chase after the fast cars, hoes and money and at the end of it, they feel empty. Because once the spirit of Satan gets what he wants from you, he leaves you high and dry to accept your judgement. Many entertainers even sing about this. </p>

<p>Just as the serpent chastised Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, he has been doing it ever sense. The serpent merely represents spiritually the left hand of God, his evil side. For there cannot be good without evil and God understood this.</p>

<p><strong>Proverbs 11King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>11 <strong>A false balance is abomination to the Lord: but a just weight is his delight.</strong></p>

<p>You have made it so simple in your mind, but it just doesn&#39;t fit. Jesus/Dionysus, Moses/Hermes, Lucifer/Prometheus, Hades/Hell, Hercules/Samson, Devil-Satan-Great Dragon/Typhon, Zeus/God, Baphomet/Pan, Deucalion/Noah, etc., etc., etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the wisdom of the LORD is for the Simple. As I explained above, there are two sides. I will present an easy diagram to understand.</p>

<p>&lt;--------------------------------------------------&gt;</p>

<p>(Negative)                                        (Positive)</p>

<p>(Intellect)                                        (Wisdom)</p>

<p>(Evil)                                                 (Good)</p>

<p>(Left)                                                 (Right)</p>

<p>Get it?</p>

<p>So Edom uses intellect, which leads to madness. They&#39;ve polluted our skies with chemtrails, our water with their nuclear radiation, our food is all grown in labs, they&#39;ve millions of species, they&#39;ve destroyed the plant life, they&#39;ve raped the ground of it&#39;s resources, they make 3 people babies, robot dogs, messing around with dark matter etc. This is the left side, or rather intellect.</p>

<p>While True Israel used wisdom aka what God made on the planet, never inventing things that would destroy the planet and staying in harmony with the earth at all times. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I assure you they are the same stories of different gods, or Baals. What you seem to believe would be blasphemous to me. Your perception is your reality, and that is great, but you are not really presenting your case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My case has been presented quite thoroughly using only the scriptures to back up what I am trying to convey. I need not to add unto the word of God for there are great consequences for doing so. As a youth I allowed Satan (this matrix) to program me to do wicked things not knowing that what I was doing was wicked. When I found God I understood why everything I had done changed me and why the people I used to hang with no longer wanted to hang. They hated the words of the father.</p>

<p><strong>John 15:18-27King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>18 If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</p>

<p>19 If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</p>

<p>20 Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</p>

<p>The serpent race is talked about in every religion known to man to have ever existed on earth. That being said, what you believe can&#39;t be verified by other religions throughout time. I think you want to believe so hard that you will make anything fit your beliefs, and will dismiss anything that contradicts your beliefs. That is not very open minded. I have no dog in the fight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t need for you to believe, only to show you the truth. John said try the spirits to see if they were my family. </p>

<p><strong>1 John 4:1-5 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do have a &quot;God&quot; in this fight, I understand you don&#39;t because you do not believe.</p>

<p>Can you tell me one prophecy that has passed from your Greek mythology?</p>

<p>Every nation on the planet has held the Israelite&#39;s captive, I find it no surprise that you will find references of the Hebrew story line in every nation. From middle east, to China (moab), to Africa (hamites), to even here in America (transatlantic slave trade). </p>

<p>Show me where your beliefs show prophecies, the only book that has been correct so far, has been the Bible.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it obvious? </p>

<p>He was speaking of Cain who was reincarnated as Esau.</p>

<p>Just as his brother Abel came back as Jacob.</p>

<p><strong>Genesis 4:2-10</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but <strong>Cain was a tiller of the ground.</strong></p>

<p>3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord.</p>

<p>4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. <strong>And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</strong></p>

<p>5 <strong>But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</strong></p>

<p>6 And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</p>

<p>7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</p>

<p>8 <strong>And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</strong></p>

<p>9 And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother&#39;s keeper?</p>

<p>10 <strong>And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother&#39;s blood crieth unto me from the ground.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cain slew Abel, just as God said would happen between the serpents seed (Negative) and the woman&#39;s seed (Positive).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s follow what happens next:</p>

<p><strong>Genesis 4:11-15</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>11 <strong>And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother&#39;s blood from thy hand;</strong></p>

<p>12 <strong>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</strong></p>

<p>13 And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</p>

<p>14 <strong>Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.</strong></p>

<p>15 And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Lord even goes on to spare Cain after this. Clearly signifying that it is talking about the brothers before the <em>reset</em> and the twins after but ultimately fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p><strong>Genesis 3:14</strong></p>

<p>14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, <strong>thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only people living this way are maybe the Amish. They use no technology, or modern invention. I am literally talking to you on a computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is pure scoffing at the words of God, for Yahawashi already said that no man can perform all 613 laws but rather have faith in God and compassion.</p>

<p><strong>Ecclesiastes 7:20</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did not the LORD say that there would be an increase in knowledge?</p>

<p><strong>Daniel 12:4</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, <strong>and knowledge shall be increased.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Know that no matter how many times you take a shower, your feet will always be dirty as soon as you step out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree that the world is being polluted, etc., but the world is not ending. There are powerful people within the Illuminati, and Knights Templars bringing about prophecy. Manufacturing the end of the world. To make you believe it is out of your hands, and the will of God. God didn&#39;t destroy the world with a flood , because it was his will. Man had become greedy , and violent , and was thus destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that you don&#39;t understand God in the slightest form, nor do I without looking at scriptures but it is clear he is a terror to make angry. </p>

<p><strong>Proverbs 9:10King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>10 <strong>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom:</strong> and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that it doesn&#39;t say the Love of the Lord or some other bullshit? That&#39;s because God is not an entity you can reason with. What he says goes, he sets up the game board and he tells us when it&#39;s finished. It is not our choice but his. Everything we see built and computed by the <em>Matrix</em> was created by him. Therefore, you have no real say. Why do you think these scientist are all scrambling to figure out if we live in a simulation? Because they&#39;ve realized they don&#39;t control the narrative of our reality. A stronger, much more wise entity does.</p>

<p>The 13 (12 now) Royal Bloodlines aren&#39;t doing anything that they aren&#39;t supposed to be doing. They are supposed to be wicked because that&#39;s how God made them. Point Blank Period.</p>

<p>Prometheus clearly took the side of humanity in their struggle with the gods of Olympus. He saw, however, than without fire, Man would remain not much more than an animal, so he tried to convince Zeus, that fire should be given to Man.</p>

<p>Zeus refused and war broke out between Man and Zeus who wanted to cleanse the Earth of them. Prometheus intervened and made Man sacrifice to Zeus, however, he wrapped the meat in skin and the bones in fat. Zeus chose the fatty good looking parcel. He was not amused when he found all that was wrapped in the fat were the bones. Again he denied Man fire and Prometheus came and stole it in a hollowed stick of fennel.</p>

<p>Next he started to teach man cooking and firing pottery. He taught them about the stars and the Arts, but took away their knowledge of the future and gave them blind hope in return. </p>

<p>Zeus found out that Man had gotten hold of Fire and, rightly, blamed Prometheus. Together with Hephaistos, his son, they moulded a woman out of clay as beautiful as Aphrodite, as modest as a maid. Athena dressed her, Aphrodite gave her grace and Hermes gave her a lovely voice and a tricky mind. This woman they named Pandorra.</p>

<p>Pandorra beguiled him with her looks and her voice, and gave this mix of sweetness and deceitfulness to all other woman. Pandorra opened the urn and all that was bad escaped in to the world. When Prometheus found out he was very sad, a last look in the jar showed him that all was left was hope, which he shook out and sent out in to the world, to give solace to Man.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the world grows miserable and Zeus decides it needs to be destroyed. He saves a Deukalion and Pyrrha, children of Prometheus and his brother Epimetheus, by putting them in a boat before he floods the world. </p>

<p>One of their children is named Hellen, who gives rise to the Hellenes, or ancient Greeks.</p>

<p>&quot;Miss me with the David Icke misinformation, that is level one conspiracy drivel.&quot;</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t think it was just some wacky new David Icke conspiracy did you?</p>

<p>The Toltec Mayan god Gucumatz was described as a &quot;serpent of wisdom&quot; who enlightened humankind. His Aztec counterpart was named Quetzalcoatl. In the Yucatan, he is called Kukulcan.</p>

<p>The Hopi refer to a race of reptoids called the Sheti, or &quot;Snake-Brothers&quot;, who live underground. The Cherokee and other Native American peoples also refer to reptoid races.</p>

<p>In pre-Columbian mythology from Colombia, Bachue (the primordial woman) transformed into a big snake. She is also sometimes called the &quot;Celestial Snake&quot; (Serpiente Celestial).</p>

<p>Many users of the drug Dimethyltryptamine (the active ingredient in many South American shamanic potions such as ayahuasca) have seen reptilian humanoids or reptilian disincarnate entities and aliens while hallucinating (Strassman 2000).</p>

<p>Cecrops I, the legendary first King of Athens was said to have been half man, half snake. The ancient Titans and Gigantes were sometimes depicted as winged man-like beings with serpents instead of legs, for example on a fresco on a temple in Pergamum. In these images from Pergamum, some of which depict the gigantomachy, one sees the giant Klyteios with huge serpents in place of legs.</p>

<p>Boreas (Aquilon to the Romans) was the Greek god of the cold north wind, described by Pausanias as a winged man with serpents for legs.
Indian scriptures and legends the Naga are reptilian beings said to live underground and interact with human beings on the surface. Some are alleged to turn human. In some versions, these beings were said to have once lived on a continent in the Indian Ocean that sank beneath the waves. Indian texts also refer to a reptilian race called the &quot;Sarpa. The Syrictae of India were a tribe of men with snake-like nostrils in place of noses and bandy serpentine legs.</p>

<p>Japanese have tales of Kappa, a basically reptilian humanoid.</p>

<p>In China, Korea and Japan, underwater realms where the Dragon Kings and their descendants live are referred to, as well as the lineage of humans from a race of dragons. This lineage was often claimed by Asian Emperors, who were believed to be able to change from human to dragon form at will, much like the modern concept of shapeshifting reptilians. However, the dragon is seen as good rather than evil in Eastern tradition.</p>

<p>Typhon, and Enchidna</p>

<p>the Middle East, reptilian beings ranging from certain Jinn to dragons and serpent-men have been spoken of since ancient times. In one of the apocryphal books purporting to be the lost Book of Jasher, a serpent race is described.</p>

<p>In the Book of Genesis, God punishes the serpent for deceiving Eve into eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil by decreeing, &quot;Upon thy belly thou shalt go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of your life&quot; (Genesis 3:14 KJV). Traditionally, many have felt this implied that the serpent (a snake or reptile) had legs before then. Thus It is therefore often portrayed in Western art as a humanoid (woman) with a snake&#39;s tail, and sometimes lizard-like feet, as in a detail from Bosch&#39;s Last Judgement.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages down to modern times, the Devil was often conceived as a humanoid with reptilian characteristics, as were demons in general. and the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</p>

<p>Africa, some shamans claim to bear extensive esoteric knowledge of a race of reptilians called the Chitauri, whom they say control the Earth. They also claim to have accounts of a reptilian race who created them and used them to work their gold mines.</p>

<p>Rhodes contends that the majority of the reptilian humanoids are descendants of the dinosaurs and are biological byproducts of Earth evolution. He also states that human attention has been intentionally misdirected away from the underworld toward deep space, so the subject of underground Earth dwelling Reptoids and lost ancient civilizations can remain secret. </p>

<p>A subterranean Nazi-friendly super race is sometimes associated with accounts of reptilian humanoids, and also with the telekinetic super race depicted in Vril: The Power of the Coming Race.</p>

<p>The brain stem is the oldest and smallest region in the evolving human brain. It evolved hundreds of millions of years ago and is more like the entire brain of present-day reptiles. For this reason, it is often called the &#39;reptilian brain&#39;. Various clumps of cells in the brain stem determine the brain&#39;s general level of alertness and regulate the vegetative processes of the body such as breathing and heartbeat.</p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to the brain possessed by the hardy reptiles that preceded mammals, roughly 200 million years ago. It&#39;s &#39;preverbal&#39;, but controls life functions such as autonomic brain, breathing, heart rate and the fight or flight mechanism. Lacking language, its impulses are instinctual and ritualistic. It&#39;s concerned with fundamental needs such as survival, physical maintenance, hoarding, dominance, preening and mating. It is also found in lower life forms such as lizards, crocodiles and birds. It is at the base of your skull emerging from your spinal column.</p>

<p>The basic ruling emotions of love, hate, fear, lust, and contentment emanate from this first stage of the brain. Over millions of years of evolution, layers of more sophisticated reasoning have been added upon this foundation.
Our intellectual capacity for complex rational thought which has made us theoretically smarter than the rest of the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>When we are out of control with rage, it is our reptilian brain overriding our rational brain components. If someone says that they reacted with their heart instead of their head. What they really mean is that they conceded to their primitive emotions (the reptilian brain based) as opposed to the calculations of the rational part of the brain. There are almond-shaped groups of neurons located deep within the medial temporal lobes of the brain in complex vertebrates, including humans. Shown in research to perform a primary role in the processing and memory of emotional reactions, the amygdalae are considered part of the limbic system.</p>

<p>And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. and the dragon fought and his angels, And prevailed not either was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</p>

<p>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I said before, The Israelite&#39;s were taken into slavery <strong>by all 17 nations</strong>. There they learned to continue their heritage with false God&#39;s retaining on bits and pieces. If it wasn&#39;t for Yahawashi turning up on the scene the gentiles/heathen Israelite&#39;s would have never came out of such worship.</p>

<p>These reptilians that you keep talking about are a race of people. These people have he same characteristics as snakes, I.E. they shed their skin. </p>

<p>There is only one group of people on the planet that Yahawah marked with the mark of Cain which is why vampire movies use the same reference. They burn in the sun, they need blood and usually do it using pagan methods, they shed blood at an astronomical rate, all throughout history and they are red.</p>

<p><strong>Malachi 1-4 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<p>1 The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi.</p>

<p>2 I have loved you, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? <strong>Was not Esau Jacob&#39;s brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob,</strong></p>

<p>3 <strong>And I hated Esau,</strong> and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</p>

<p>4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the Lord of hosts, <strong>They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.</strong></p>

<p>Why does the LORD, out of all 17 nations keep saying that it is Edom he that he hates?</p>

<p>Why does he say that they are the border of wickedness?</p>

<p>Why does he want to throw down what they have built.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 49:11King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>11 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; <strong>they call 
their lands after their own names.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amerigo Vespucci (America) = What is his earthly nationality?</p>

<p>Scorpio Africanus (Africa) = What is his earthly nationality?</p>

<p>Christopher Columbus (Cuba) = What is his earthly nationality?</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;d like to add where are your sources? I can&#39;t find all this stuff you keep talking about in the Bible and I have access to a KJV 1611, so I&#39;m confused where you are getting your information.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pulling from +2000 year old sources and you are simply going off what&#39;s rattling in your brain? </p>

<p>In a debate class they would throw tomatoes.</p>

<p>Again, what prophecy has Greek Mythology showed by itself without trying to mix the fathers knowledge into whatever twisted form of history recreation you have.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about <em>fun</em>, the end of this world is right around the corner and here you are doing madlibs with old information trying to piece together totally different beliefs. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a good look.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I can&#39;t find all this stuff you keep talking about in the Bible &quot;</p>

<p>You would have to be a little more specific. If I reference the Bible . Then it is in there. Please be more specific. </p>

<p>The point is, it is  the same gods. when Zeus fought the Titans he claimed himself god of gods. King of Kings. No other god was his equal, and only Zeus be worshipped. Sound familiar(The Bible/God of the Old Testament.). It sounds like you simply worship cronus instead of Zeus. The Jews also worship Cronus.</p>

<p>You say Abel came back as Jacob? Therefore, you believe in reincarnation of Abel into Jacob? Where is the definitive biblical proof of this? The conclusions you come to don&#39;t fit. My interpretations at least fit , and have similarity. Snake is a snake. </p>

<p>Primitive man could only interpret the best he could. When witnessing advanced technology would seem improbable to describe, but in these modern times we understand now.</p>

<p>If there are only two lineage of Cain, and Abel. Why Mark Cain? There must have been other populations of people on earth to Mark Cain as to enact the seven times revenge.</p>

<p>Jonah, and the whale/big fish-submarine technology. Jesus birth- artificial insemination. The story of Noah and the flood. We know it is impossible to put two of every animal in a boat, and multiples of livestock, in all the world, but you could take the dna of the animals and then repopulate the earth. The three wise men/magi followed a traveling star to the birth of Jesus. Must have been some sort of flying craft as a star can&#39;t do this. Pimitive man witnessing this type of technology would be baffled as if witnessing magic. Beasts  like the Leviathan are described like being a solid metal aircraft that could bomb cities. </p>

<p>Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?</p>

<p>2 Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?</p>

<p>14 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.</p>

<p>15 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.</p>

<p>16 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</p>

<p>17 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</p>

<p>This  specifically sounds like a welded metal that not even air can enter.</p>

<p>18 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</p>

<p>19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.</p>

<p>20 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.</p>

<p>21 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</p>

<p>This sounds like headlights, or lights as eyes, and fire like from a jet engine burning from his mouth/exhaust.</p>

<p>22 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</p>

<p>23 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</p>

<p>Sealed like a welded metal?</p>

<p>24 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.</p>

<p>25 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</p>

<p>26 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</p>

<p>Nothing can penetrate the metal hide.</p>

<p>27 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</p>

<p>28 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</p>

<p>29 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</p>

<p>30 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</p>

<p>31 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</p>

<p>32 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</p>

<p>More light like lights on a plane, and terrible sounding fire from it&#39;s mouth/exhaust.</p>

<p>33 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</p>

<p>34 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.</p>

<p>This great weapon/aircraft struck fear in their primitive minds.</p>

<p>Also, this is not a debate. I doubt either of us change our views on them matter. Advanced technology would at the time seem like magic , and they tied to describe these events the best they know how, but in these modern times we should begin to understand this.</p>

<p>The prophets were poets. Understanding this, you have to read into what they are saying at times and other times you don&#39;t. The Bible has spiritual parts and carnal parts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t compare, you attempted to add it in. Notice how I have not added any other doctrine into the mix? Yea, there are a reason for that.</p>

<p>Regardless of what you believe, the Israelite&#39;s and the Greeks were not the same. Yes there were Israelite&#39;s who became heathenish (through force as I showed earlier), but they are not the same.</p>

<p>We see it is clear that Yahawah&#39;s end game is race wars between the two.</p>

<p><strong>Zechariah 9:13</strong></p>

<p>“When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, <strong>and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece,</strong> and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.” </p>

<p>It is clear that Judah/Ephraim (head tribe of the 10 northen tribes) will be at odds against the sons of Greece, which is tribute to Alexander the Great. The first white conqueror.</p>

<p>My ego is high only because I have on the spiritual armor and don&#39;t lie to myself. It is clear that the story is about to end my friend. Thus saith the LORD, I am simply telling you the truth but I knew you wouldn&#39;t get it because it was no meant for you to get. This is the messiah said don&#39;t cast your pearls before swine.</p>

<p>10 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; <strong>but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.</strong></p>

<p>One, the devil is depicted red by your own European leaders. In all the movies, that&#39;s what they choose to bare. Also, so called white people are not white, they are red.

<p>21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</p>

<p>22 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord; but Baal&#39;s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</p>

<p>23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:</p>

<p>24 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</p>

<p>25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.</p>

<p>26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</p>

<p>27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</p>

<p>28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</p>

<p>29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</p>

<p>30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down.</p>

<p>31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:</p>

<p>32 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</p>

<p>33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</p>

<p>34 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</p>

<p>35 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</p>

<p>36 <strong>And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.</strong></p>

<p>37 Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.</p>

<p>38 Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</p>

<p>39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The Lord, he is the God; the Lord, he is the God.</p>

<p>Clearly showing that Baal is a false God that was/is at adversary to Yahawah.</p>

<p>Either way, doesn&#39;t matter how you or I feel. It is clear Edom is losing it&#39;s grips on the earth, therefore, war is coming. There is nothing you or I can do about this. Once Rothschild (Illuminati) falls, so will the rest of Edom for they are your head, regardless of how wicked you think they are.</p>

<p>It is clear that the so called white man worships the devil and also why you do in almost every avenue presented. From your shows/movies to your past times like death metal and throwing up the baphomet at the concerts. All of it is designed for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why won&#39;t you answer some of my questions? If Cain and Abel are the only two lineages why put a mark on Cain? To spare him from whom?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say they were the only two lineages, I said that these two boys would be the start of the story of this reality. He was spared because it was more punishing to allow him to live with the guilt, just as his later ancestor Esau would.</p>

<p><strong>Hebrews 12:16-17</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>16 Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, <strong>as Esau,</strong> who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</p>

<p>17 <strong>For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now Rothschild builds his nukes, warplanes, tanks, submarines, satellites, soon to be introduced mark of the beast, ww3 etc. All for the purpose of holding the true Israelite&#39;s hostage because he knows that God will never give him the blessing. This is going to happen very soon. The father says that 2/3&#39;s of the Israelite&#39;s will be killed 1/3 left therein to be sealed with the 144k chosen elect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adam-It could be ultimately derived from Hebrew אדם (&#39;adam) meaning &quot;to be red&quot;, referring to the ruddy colour of human skin.Red as in white. If Adam was red, then why do you say the serpent race is red?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two types of Red in the Bible</p>

<p>The word used to describe Adam </p>

<blockquote>
<p>אֲדָמָה ʼădâmâh, ad-aw-maw&#39;; from H119; soil (from its general redness):—country, earth, ground, husband(-man) (-ry), land</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word used to describe Esau</p>

<blockquote>
<p>אַדְמֹנִי ʼadmônîy, ad-mo-nee&#39;; or (fully) אַדְמוֹנִי ʼadmôwnîy ; from H119; reddish (of the hair or the complexion):—red, ruddy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice how David was mentioned to be Ruddy not Red as Esau was?</p>

<p><strong>1 Samuel 16:12-13 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>12 And he sent, and brought him in. <strong>Now he was ruddy,</strong> and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While genesis 25:25 shows that Esau was born RED not RUDDY.</p>

<p><strong>Genesis 25:25King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>25 And the <strong>first came out red,</strong> all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clear distinction.</p>

<p>6 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.</p>

<p>Reincarnation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You believe in reincarnation in the bible? Where?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God tells David he will come back through the line of his seed:</p>

<p><strong>2 Samuel 7:12-14</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>12 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</p>

<p>13 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</p>

<p>14 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next we have a psalm from David clearly showing that he was speaking of his return later on because David did not die this way.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 22:15-18</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.</p>

<p>16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.</p>

<p>17 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.</p>

<p>18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is a clear description of how the Messiah would die but coming from <strong>DAVID</strong>.</p>

<p>Here is the Messiah on reincarnation.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 11:12-15</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</p>

<p>13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</p>

<p>14 <strong>And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.</strong></p>

<p>15 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence, they had been waiting on the return of the spirit of Elias aka John. </p>

<p><strong>Matthew 19:28</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, <strong>That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even the apocrypha follows suit.</p>

<p><strong>2 Esdras 14:34-35</strong></p>

<p>34 Therefore if so be that ye will subdue your own understanding, and reform your hearts, ye shall be kept alive and after death ye shall obtain mercy.</p>

<p>35 <strong>For after death shall the judgment come, when we shall live again: and then shall the names of the righteous be manifest, and the works of the ungodly shall be declared.</strong></p>

<p>Do you not see the earth? How it follows the circle of life? If God created a system that could live off itself and recycle within itself, would not the spirit world be the same? Duh.</p>

<p>Like I said the angels that rebelled are locked in the earth, not running about playing gods.</p>

<p>Here Zeus son Apollo , or apollyon is mentioned</p>

<p>And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.</p>

<p>2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.</p>

<p>3 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</p>

<p>4 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.</p>

<p>5 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.</p>

<p>6 And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.</p>

<p>7 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.</p>

<p>8 And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.</p>

<p>9 And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.</p>

<p>10 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.</p>

<p>11 And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</p>

<p><strong>Jude 1:3-6</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</p>

<p>4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</p>

<p>6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one precept saying that there were rebellious angels. </p>

<p>But this was talking about Israelite&#39;s. How do we know?</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 22:30</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, <strong>but are as the angels of God in heaven.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the Israelite&#39;s are the saints, the angels, the gods of this planet. Unfortunately, our power has left us because we did not deserve his protection and must learn why we need him.</p>

<p>Also Revelation chapter 9 is talking about <strong>thermonuclear missiles.</strong></p>

The bible says Satan was cast to the earth chained up. It says Apollo co.es down from heaven. You have no answer just. Uh he is evil. I am good. White man evil. Black good. White man was given power over this earth for a reason you can&#39;t begin to understand. I say Abraham wasn&#39;t black. You say yes he was cause moses this, and moses that, but your proof lies in what it doesn&#39;t say in the bible? That makes no sense. Reincarnation is bullshit. You die and wait for judgement day. You say I lack faith, but you literally believe nothing the bible actually says. Only your interpretation which is bypassed towards yourself, and your ethnicity. 
You still have failed to explain why the lord in Hosea says you will call me Baal no longer, but is hi. You can&#39;t explain why Apollo descends from heaven after the trumpet sounds when the angels that sinned are chained in darkness. You are not chained in darkness. You are not a Jew, or a god either. Embrace your heritage and be proud. Surely your family doesn&#39;t approve of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bible says Satan was cast to the earth chained up. It says Apollo co.es down from heaven. You have no answer just. Uh he is evil. I am good. White man evil. Black good. White man was given power over this earth for a reason you can&#39;t begin to understand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes because Rothschild lives the life of luxury, heaven/hell on this plain is a condition. You cannot understand this because you are not meant to get it. So Rothschild (the richest man on the planet) being brought down. The Angels of Satan are demons, (people who follow him).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I say Abraham wasn&#39;t black. You say yes he was cause moses this, and moses that, but your proof lies in what it doesn&#39;t say in the bible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you read the Bible then you interpret it. It is wisdom to understand that if both Moses, Mary, Joseph and the messiah hid among the Egyptians, they had to be the same color. <strong>Duh.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>That makes no sense. Reincarnation is bullshit. You die and wait for judgement day. You say I lack faith, but you literally believe nothing the bible actually says. Only your interpretation which is bypassed towards yourself, and your ethnicity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, it is prophecy that you would say these things. You can&#39;t understand because it is not meant for you to understand for Esau/Edom are the wicked.</p>

<p>Malachi 1:4</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the Lord of hosts, <strong>They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Daniel 12:10King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>10 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; <strong>but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.</strong></p>

<p>ou still have failed to explain why the lord in Hosea says you will call me Baal no longer, but is hi.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Already explained, you did not accept it. Baal is the name of the false God that Rothschild uses. The Israelite&#39;s, were persecuted, enslaved and forced to learn white Christianity aka the Devil AKA BAAL.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&#39;t explain why Apollo descends from heaven after the trumpet sounds when the angels that sinned are chained in darkness. You are not chained in darkness. You are not a Jew, or a god either. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Apollyon is reference to the Devil, once again as I&#39;ve told you. So simply look at it as Edom&#39;s doing. These are nuclear warheads that are being described.</p>

<p>As for the angels chained in darkness, you used one precept and I defeated you once one looks at the entire chapter. Face it, you don&#39;t have wisdom. It was talking about the Israelites, who would not listen to God.</p>

<p>No I am not chained in Darkness. I believe and have faith that the son of man will come to save me regardless if my people have been made the tail long ago, we have no money, we have no standing army, we have no guns, nukes or anything else that the so called white man has. I know for a fact after reading the Bible that God LOVES the underdog, it&#39;s when he does his best work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Embrace your heritage and be proud. Surely your family doesn&#39;t approve of this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do embrace my heritage as Israel, which is why I show myself approved, not by reading other doctrines or coming up with my own thoughts and opinions but using the precepts written in the greatest song ever sung. I also care not about what my family thinks.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 12:50</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have explained nothing on your side, even science (created by Edom) condems your point of view. The world started off melanated, there is noway that the people claiming to be Jews today are the sons of the Jews of antiquity for they were all dark skinned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>George Friedmann in his book, The End of the Jewish People, pointedly states that the <strong>Europeans claiming to be Jews, are nothing more then Hebrew speaking Gentiles.&quot;The late president of Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser, stated on television, &quot;you (the Jews) will never be able to live here in peace, because you left here black but came back white. We cannot except you!</strong></p>

Just as we&#39;ve been seeing meteorites all over the place.
 And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;</p>

<p>11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.</p>

<p>This is completely different. Not even same chapter. This star is called apollyon and has the key to the bottomless pit/tartarus. </p>

<p>And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.</p>

<p>See here it says and to HIM was given the key.
And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.</p>

<p>10 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.</p>

<p>11 And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</p>

<p>Directly named the Greek god Apollo. Or in Hebrew abaddon. O ye of little faith.</p>

<p>This is not a reference to a nucleur weapon. This is the Greek god Apollo opening tartarus. </p>

<p>I apologize, you do not quote precepts so it becomes a little confusing trying to debate. Most of your gibberish is just linked with different precepts from one book to another with no quotes or even precept numbers to follow. You&#39;re literally all over the place.</p>

<p>Revelation 9 is literally talking about Edom (choose whatever false God you want to call him, Satan, Devil, Apollyon, Lucifer, Zeus, Baal, Baphaompet, Pan etc.) using Nuclear War Heads on the people.</p>

<p>Nuclear Apocalypse is almost here.</p>

<p>For this is the judgement of God.</p>

<p>No man in history has ever &quot;walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire&quot; or &quot;fallen from heaven.&quot; Man is not capable of the things the great serpent can do.
Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone [was] thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou [art] the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee [so]: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou [wast] perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee</p>

<p>And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.&quot;
You can be sure God was not punishing four legged beasts by afflicting them with boils.</p>

<p>Leviticus 20:15-16: &quot;And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.&quot;</p>

<p>This certainly could not be a four legged beast that a man or woman could lie with. If it were, God would not demand the death penalty for a dumb animal with no reasoning power.</p>

<p>Exodus 19:13: &quot;There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.&quot;
Now we have a beast with a hand. Do you believe God told Moses to talk to the camels, donkeys, cattle and tell them not to touch the mount?</p>

<p>Jeremiah 7:20: &quot;Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast...&quot;
Jeremiah 21:6: &quot;And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.&quot;
Would God refer to a four legged beast as an inhabitant of a city?</p>

<p>Jeremiah 27:6: &quot;And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.&quot;
The Negro race has always been used as servants.</p>

<p>Jeremiah 31:27-30: &quot;...the seed of man, and with the seed of beast...But every one shall die for his own iniquity.&quot;
How can an animal die for his sins and iniquity? They cannot because they do not know God’s Laws so they cannot sin.</p>

<p>Jeremiah 31:34: &quot;And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.&quot;</p>

<p>Ezekiel 14:15: &quot;If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts.&quot;
Only two legged beasts could stop man from passing through the land.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 29:11: &quot;No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.&quot;
Now the beast inhabitant not only has a hand but a foot as well. Animals have hoofs or paws.</p>

<p>Jonah 3:7-8: &quot;Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.&quot;
What manner of beast would wear sackcloth; have the power of speech and, once again, we see that the beast has hands?</p>

<p>Zechariah 8:10: &quot;For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast...&quot;
Here we have beasts that can be hired.
The great boast of modern civilization is its unparalleled degree of enlightenment when compared with preceding ages.

<p>It is literally talking about animal here. The Laws of God are not for confusion.</p>

<p>If a man or woman has sex with an animal, they shall be put to death was/is the law in the coming kingdom. Even the animal in Edom&#39;s world today kills an animal who has been abused in this matter.</p>

<p>No. What I understand is that Yahawah can do whatever he pleases to this matrix. If he wants to kill someone he can have it done. If he wants to exalt someone he can have it done. If he wants to destroy the earth, he can have it done. So if he wants to kill his creations, he can have it done. It is his will. </p>

<p>Yes, people had farms and livestock...</p>

<p>Jeremiah 27:6: &quot;And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.&quot; The Negro race has always been used as servants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is talking about the King of Babylon being granted power where the Israelite&#39;s once had it. The Beasts of the field are the surrounding animals of the land and livestock... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Negro race has always been used as servants.</p>

<p>What a cowinkydink so have the <strong>Lost 12 tribes of Israel,</strong> according to the Bible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jeremiah 31:27-30: &quot;...the seed of man, and with the seed of beast...But every one shall die for his own iniquity.&quot; How can an animal die for his sins and iniquity? They cannot because they do not know God’s Laws so they cannot sin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A question like this is only asked when someone is either not an Israelite or they are scoffing. The Bible breaks down into formulas, like how Numbers 1:18 says that God goes by the father&#39;s side. That follows up throughout the entire Bible you will find not one contradiction. </p>

<p>So if we know that the laws, statues and commandments are only for Israel, then why would an animal know sin? It is but a dumb animal. So why even ask a question like this? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ezekiel 14:15: &quot;If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts.&quot; Only two legged beasts could stop man from passing through the land.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? So you think in the middle of the Jungle, that a lion coming out of nowhere isn&#39;t going to strike fear in a mans heart? Do you even understand what you are saying at this point?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ezekiel 29:11: &quot;No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.&quot; Now the beast inhabitant not only has a hand but a foot as well. Animals have hoofs or paws.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t what the hell are you reading LOL</p>

<p>It says</p>

<p>No Foot of Man</p>

<p>NOR Foot of beast</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it logical that foot (English) is easily understood to mean paw in (Paeleo Hebrew)? How hard is that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jonah 3:7-8: &quot;Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.&quot; What manner of beast would wear sackcloth; have the power of speech and, once again, we see that the beast has hands?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fool, sackcloth represents poverty, it was to beg God for mercy via Humbleness. Even the king participated, did they throw sackcloth on the animals? Most likely not, but they probably didn&#39;t give them as much food and water as they normally would have and made them humble down in their own way.</p>

<p>If you would have just went up a few precepts though, the spirit would have given you that wisdom. </p>

<p><strong>Jonah 3:1-6 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 And the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</p>

<p>2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</p>

<p>3 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days&#39; journey.</p>

<p>4 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day&#39;s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</p>

<p>5 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</p>

<p>6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</p>

<p>Zechariah 8:10: &quot;For before these days there was no hire for man, <strong>nor any hire for beast</strong>...&quot; Here we have beasts that can be hired. The great boast of modern civilization is its unparalleled degree of enlightenment when compared with preceding ages. While marvelous advances have been made in the realm of many sciences, in other respects we are still groping about in a clouded maze of misconceptions. Colleges and universities have been taken over by aliens and are teaching as truth philosophies which have no substance in actual fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take your time to read, you are not ready for someone as blessed as me. I&#39;d tell you to use wisdom but I know it is not found within you so I will explain it. Here is something to ponder on, if this was thousands of years ago, what do you think they did for transportation, cutting larges fields of grass, traveling, moving large items etc. Use that and perhaps you will answer your own question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reference of a Cherub is God telling Ezekiel this is what he is supposed to prophecy. It is clear that the Bible insinuates God made a metaphor. He had anointed the King of Babylon to power (Again God controls both sides), to punish the Israelites.</p>

<p>But their sin raised to high which is why in precept 15 on down in Ezekiel 28. God is litterally marveling at his own work (creating such a wicked creation) in these precepts. </p>

<p>This is the same thing that happens in Revelation (the end of this reality). <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/china-hypersonic-glide-vehicle-ballistic-missile-destroy-us-defense-767716">America will be nuked by a multitude of nations all at once and destroyed within one hour.</a></p>

<p>This is the outcome that we are witnessing happen. </p>

<p>So understand that this is metaphoric, the king of Babylon was not an actual cherub. He was a man liken to a cherub in the scriptures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus/Dionysus/Bacchus
Elements, such as the celebration by a ritual meal of bread and wine, also have parallels. The omophagia was the Dionysian act of eating raw flesh and drinking wine to consume the god. Within Orphism, it was believed that consuming the meat and wine was symbolic of the Titans eating the flesh (meat) and blood (wine) of Dionysus and that, by participating in the omophagia, Dionysus&#39; followers could achieve communion with the god. Powell, in particular, argues that precursors to the Catholic notion of transubstantiation can be found in Dionysian religion.
As with Jesus, December 25th and January 6th are both traditional birth dates in the Dionysian myth and simply represent the period of the winter solstice. Indeed, the winter-solstice date of the Greek sun and wine god Dionysus was originally recognized in early January but was eventually placed on December 25th, as related by ancient Latin writer Macrobius (c. 400 AD/CE). Regardless, the effect is the same: The winter sun god is born around this time, when the shortest day of the year begins to become longer.
In the common myth about the birth of Dionysus/Bacchus, Semele is mysteriously impregnated by one of Zeus&#39;s bolts of lightning--an obvi­ous miraculous/virgin conception.
The miracles of Dionysus are legendary, as is his role as the god of wine, echoed in the later Christian story of Jesus multiplying the jars of wine at the wedding feast of Cana (Jn 2:1-9).
&quot;This story is really the Christian counterpart to the pagan legends of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, who at his annual festival in his temple of Elis filled three empty kettles with wine-no water needed! And on the fifth of January wine instead of water gushed from his temple at Andros. If we believe Jesus&#39; miracle, why should we not believe Dionysus&#39;s? (Leedom, 125)
Dionysus&#39;s miracle of changing water to wine is recounted in pre-Christian times by Diodorus
Dionysus a solar hero, born of a virgin on &quot;December 25th&quot; or the winter solstice, performing miracles and receiving divine epithets, being killed, giving his blood as a sacrifice, resurrecting from the dead after three days in Hades/Hell, and ascending into heaven
Included in the twelve Olympians, as the last of their number, and the only god born from a mortal mother.
The cult of Dionysus is also a &quot;cult of the souls&quot;; his maenads feed the dead through blood-offerings, and he acts as a divine communicant between the living and the dead. He is sometimes categorised as a dying-and-rising god.
In Greek mythology, he is presented as a son of Zeus and the mortal Semele, thus semi-divine or heroic: and as son of Zeus and Persephone or Demeter, thus both fully divine, part-chthonic and possibly identical with Iacchus of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Some scholars believe that Dionysus is a syncretism of a local Greek nature deity and a more powerful god from Thrace or Phrygia such as Sabazios or Zalmoxis.
Dionysus was the son of Zeus and Persephone, the queen of the Greek underworld. Diodorus&#39; sources equivocally identified the mother as Demeter. A jealous Hera again attempted to kill the child, this time by sending Titans to rip Dionysus to pieces after luring the baby with toys. It is said that he was mocked by the Titans who gave him a thyrsus (a fennel stalk) in place of his rightful sceptre.[21] Zeus turned the Titans into dust with his thunderbolts, but only after the Titans ate everything but the heart, which was saved, variously, by Athena, Rhea, or Demeter. Zeus used the heart to recreate him in his thigh, hence he was again &quot;the twice-born&quot;.
According to a legend, when Alexander the Great reached a city called Nysa near the Indus river, the locals said that their city was founded by Dionysus in the distant past and their city was dedicated to the god Dionysus. These travels took something of the form of military conquests; according to Diodorus Siculus he conquered the whole world except for Britain and Ethiopia.[27] Returning in triumph (he was considered the founder of the triumphal procession) he undertook to introduce his worship into Greece
It is a measure of Bacchus&#39;s ambiguous position in classical mythology that he, unlike the other Olympians, had to use a boat to travel to and from the islands with which he is associated&quot;
Dionysus was of the few Olympians with the power to remove deceased mortals from the underworld, and thus restore them to life. He descended to the underworld (Hades) to rescue his mother Semele, whom he had not seen since his birth, making the descent by way of a reputedly bottomless pool on the coast of the Argolid near the prehistoric site of Lerna, and bypassing Thanatos, the god of death.
The Dionysia and Lenaia festivals in Athens were dedicated to Dionysus. On numerous vases (referred to as Lenaia vases), the god is shown participating in the ritual sacrifice as a masked and clothed pillar (sometimes a pole, or tree is used), while his worshipers eat bread and drink wine. Initiates worshipped him in the Dionysian Mysteries, which were comparable to and linked with the Orphic Mysteries, and may have influenced Gnosticism
In the Orphic tradition of ancient Greece, Dionysus Zagreus served as its patron god connected to death and immortality, and symbolized the one who guides reincarnation.
Many identify both Dionysus and Jesus with the dying-and-returning god In The Bacchae where Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity, which is compared to the New Testament scene of Jesus being interrogated by Pontius Pilate.
Other elements, such as the celebration by a ritual meal of bread and wine, also have parallels. The omophagia was the Dionysian act of eating raw flesh and drinking wine to consume the god. Within Orphism, it was believed that consuming the meat and wine was symbolic of the Titans eating the flesh (meat) and blood (wine) of Dionysus and that, by participating in the omophagia, Dionysus&#39; followers could achieve communion with the god. Powell, in particular, argues that precursors to the Catholic notion of transubstantiation can be found in Dionysian religion.
Dionysus savior-god whose birth was observed on DEC-25. He was worshipped throughout much of the Middle East as well as in Greece. He had a center of worship in Jerusalem in the 1st century BCE. Some ancient coins were found in Gaza with Dionysus on one side and JHWH (Jehovah) on the other. In later years, his flesh and blood were symbolically eaten in the form of bread and wine. He was viewed as the son of Zeus, the Father God.</p>

<p>They did not go by Black Israelite. They went by either those who knew who they were Israel and those Israelite&#39;s and those who didn&#39;t know who they were, I.E. gentiles. This was due to the King of Greece banning them to continue their practice and thus destroying their heritage.</p>

<p>This is why Paul was so important, he was the spirit of unity. He urged the Israelite&#39;s to not hate the gentile Israelite&#39;s who didn&#39;t follow the customs of their forefathers. </p>

<p>For it is by blood that one is of Israel not spirit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we are to believe in Jesus miracle of changing water into wine, then why not Dionysus?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Believe in that, it clear the Bible is not for you, again, you promote something other than the Bible at every turn, you don&#39;t believe the messiah is ever coming and you believe that it is Dionysus is the true so called Jesus.</p>

<p>You pretty much have a doctrine here, why not follow it? Call on that name in the terrible times ahead and see how far he will get you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&#39;t you see there is no way these captive black Israelite&#39;s would know all of this, and the evil white man copied it. Impossible. what is more likely is that the pre existing Dionysus was later made into Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can&#39;t you see that it is because God ordained that his elect would never forget him? Therefore, they knew what had to be done. There were those among us who hid in the caves to worship God.</p>

<p><strong>2 Maccabees 6:10-14</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>8 Moreover there went out a decree to the neighbour cities of the heathen, by the suggestion of Ptolemee, against the Jews, that they should observe the same fashions, and be partakers of their sacrifices:</p>

<p>9 And whoso would not conform themselves to the manners of the Gentiles should be put to death. Then might a man have seen the present misery.</p>

<p>10 For there were two women brought, who had circumcised their children; whom when they had openly led round about the city, the babes handing at their breasts, they cast them down headlong from the wall.</p>

<p>11 And others, that had run together into caves near by, to keep the sabbath day secretly, being discovered by Philip, were all burnt together, because they made a conscience to help themselves for the honour of the most sacred day.</p>

<p>12 Now I beseech those that read this book, that they be not discouraged for these calamities, but that they judge those punishments not to be for destruction, but for a chastening of our nation.</p>

<p>13 For it is a token of his great goodness, when wicked doers are not suffered any long time, but forthwith punished.</p>

<p>14 For not as with other nations, whom the Lord patiently forbeareth to punish, till they be come to the fulness of their sins, so dealeth he with us,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First you stopped us from doing so but people still did it even if they faced death. It was those among them that survived it all that had the knowledge of who they were still. The rest followed suit to the laws of whatever system that was in place. Those stories in Greece came from our knowledge from the script writers of Israelite&#39;s who followed the customs of Greece I.E. the gentiles. This happened in every nation that the Israelite&#39;s were ever held captive/sojourned.</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s what God wants, don&#39;t ask me, go search the Bible. Only the Israelite&#39;s are going to be saved. The Gentiles are Israelite&#39;s who didn&#39;t know they were Israelite&#39;s because they were forced to not keep their customs.</p>

<p>Micheal making war with the dragon shows us that Satan = <strong>Man</strong></p>

<p><strong>Revelation 12:7-8 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 <strong>And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,</strong></p>

<p>8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>War between Man &amp; God (The Last Rebellion).</p>

<p><strong>Revelation 19:19-20 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>19 <strong>And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.</strong></p>

<p>20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Showing that it is MAN once again who is making war against God.</p>

<p>We even read further we see that the metaphor is even pushed again.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation 20:1-3 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>20 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.</p>

<p>2 And he laid hold on <strong>the dragon</strong> , <strong>that old serpent</strong> , <strong>which is the Devil</strong> , <strong>and Satan</strong>, and bound him a thousand years,</p>

<p>3 <strong>And cast him into the bottomless pit</strong> , and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.</p>

<p>correlates to prophecy</p>

<p><strong>Luke 10:18 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<p>Yes, an angel of the LORD on the <strong>LEFT</strong> hand side I.E. the dragon , that old serpent , which is the Devil , and Satan who is in the physical manifestation of <strong>Edom.</strong></p>

<p>I have not contradicted myself once, it is because you do not understand. I assure you</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G3&amp;amp;t=KJV">Appllo</a> is the translated word for Abaddon.</p>

<p>Which translate to destruction/destroyer</p>

<blockquote>
<p>perish, vanish, go astray, be destroyed</p>

<p>(Hiphil)</p>

<p>to destroy, put to death</p>

<p>of divine judgment</p>

<p>object name of kings (fig.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just as he said he was coming to destroy those who destroy the earth.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation 11:18 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>18 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; <strong>and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This correlates to the scriptures perfectly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are reading what you want to read brother.A bad interpretation. Just yesterday you said that Apollo is edom, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just yesterday I told you that apollo is simply another word for <strong>THE SPIRIT OF SATAN.</strong> This is what I told you. </p>

<p>I said that all Gods that are not Yahawah are false, this is what I told you.</p>

<p>Who is the destroyer of this current reality? Who would everyone no matter what color or what religion they follow blame for the destruction of earth all together unanimously?</p>

<p>The Destroyers. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but he is chaining the dragon you believe to be the devil/Satan. This is a contradiction. Nothing more. so edom who you believe is evil is chaining the dragon/devil/Satan?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I did not interpret this, the Bible says they are all one in the same, for all deities and entities are false/deceivers that are not Yahawah and his right hand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 And he laid hold on <strong>the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan,</strong> and bound him a thousand years,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right there, in clear view, these are all the same metaphoric entities the spirit of sin/negativity.</p>

<p>The angel that descended in of the Devil (deceiver).</p>

<p><strong>Revelation 12:12King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<p>12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! <strong>for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.</strong></p>

<p>Again, Revelation 9 is talking about Edom the physical manifestation of <strong>the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan,</strong> using his gadgets on the people of the world and ending with thermo nuclear destruction.</p>

<p>The Bible does not contradict itself and anyone that is actually trying to get to the bottom of the truth can see this.</p>

<p>No. I believe this happened as it wasn&#39;t placed in a metaphoric setting. It says the LORD did it accordingly. There was no metaphoric setup with words that liken it to something else. It&#39;s written verbatim.</p>

<p>I also believe that the LORD destroyed the earth and that Noah did save the creatures with the Ark which again is written Verbatim.</p>

<p>No it really is, you have to erase everything you know about it to read it the correct way. The devil has controlled this artifact for many centuries and has spread lies on the father and his message he left in this book. When I first started, I remember finding out things that I grew up hearing were in fact so wrong it was disgusting. I found that I had been lied to majority of my life from people who seemingly didn&#39;t even open the book themselves to fact check it. </p>

<p>So coming into this saying that the information of the world is correct is complete and utter bullshit. </p>

Ancient insults like the word fool you use all the time, that the Bible forbids. </p>

<p>I have been to many churches myself, Baptist, penecostle, Catholic, Methodist, etc.
I assure you that they all interpret the Bible differently , and condemn each other to hell. They all read the same Bible, and worship the same god, but are so far away from each other it is embarrassing .</p>

<p>All the churches I went to can&#39;t answer my questions. Just like you. They say oh don&#39;t think about that, that isn&#39;t important, just listen to our interpretation. 
Well interpretations are like assholes, everybody has one. You may as well insert the word opinion, instead of interpretation, cause that is all that it is.</p>

<p>These are the basic strategies in a divide and conquer tactic. We will never come together to solve anything, problems, because we are so divided up by race, religion, politics, etc. The Bible is mostly Jewish propaganda. Plain and simple. Just like the television. You watch the television enough it will brainwashed you. Your teachers have used the Bible as a tool to divide us .</p>

<p>You can wait for a black god savior to come and save you from your horrible plight. I think that there would be a million Africans that would gladly change places with you in a heart beat. You have become spoiled in modern times. You forgot how bad you really used to have it. I am not that gullible. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you find it convenient that there are a million different religions, and a million different interpretations? This is so the human race doesn&#39;t come together and shake off the evil Jew. </p>

<p>You keep referencing to lineage. That doesn&#39;t mean they are black. There are two types of Jews. Your Hebrew jew that is dark skinned, and ashkenazi Jews, who appear more white skinned, and have lineage to ancient germany. This is probably the two types of Jews, not black African, or Mexican latinos, etc. This is just wishful thinking on your part. You wish you were a Jew, so you have to rationalize why.</p>

<p>You keep referencing how I am suppossed to debate you by using scripture, but you won&#39;t look at anything other than the Bible. You are like a child that puts his fingers in his ears, and says na, Na, Na ,Na I&#39;m not listening. Why do I have to stick to certain guidelines when organized religion, and everything they teach is a joke? What you believe is a black version of organized religion. Free your mind and your ass will follow.</p>

<p>Every organized religion really doesn&#39;t believe in the supernatural either. They rationalize word of god to be man, or something that man can understand. </p>

<p>I asked you about the flying triangles in the video you linked, and what you believe that it is?</p>

<p>I have witnessed one of these flying triangles personally. It set and hovered for a few minutes, then shot of at incredible light speed. I have personally witnessed ghosts. If everything are reincarnated , why have I personally witnessed ghosts, and I have seen a child ghost too. Did not a child need to reincarnated, and not live eternity till judgement day as a ghost? I have seen incredible things, and experienced incredible things, not visions in my head, or spirit world bullshit, but in the real physical present world. What you teach to a man like me doesn&#39;t add up. I know I am merely white, and not a black god like being like you, who can&#39;t understand, but my personal experiences tells me there is a hell of a lot more to the world than your simple rational explanations for everything.</p>

<p>Jonah and the whale is impossible to survive in the belly of a well. Use your damn brain. It had to be a submerged craft, like submarine of some sort. We know putting two, and four, of every animal on earth on a boat is impossible. Use your brain , sir. Noah had access to advance genetic technology. Taking the DNA of the animals, and re cloning the animal population. Gene splicing also explains some of the of creatures that represented several animals, or animals mixed with human genetics.  Don&#39;t think of Noah as a primitive nobody. He was a highly advanced genetics expert. With access to highly advanced technology. </p>

<p>Where do you believe the cross symbol comes from? 
Why was Jesus crucified upon it?</p>

<p>The cross symbol is the symbol of the sky god. Jesus was nailed to the symbol of the sky god. Why? When primitive man witnessed a plane flying over head , with the wings it looks like a cross when directly over head. Constantine saw this in the sky, and changed to Christianity.</p>

<p>However before the Milvian Bridge battle he and his army saw a cross of light in the sky above the sun </p>

<p>I assure you the Bible is speaking of advanced technology, and primitive man is trying to explain the best he knows how.</p>

<p>How could any church that teaches the Bible, or preachers who went to school to be a preacher, could possibly understand this? They can&#39;t. They have been propagandized to near death. Like you. They will not listen to a word of it, unless it goes along with their religion the have been indoctrinated in.</p>

<p>You will come around to this idea in the future. </p>

<p>Instead of further debate, let us watch the world move toward the prophecies to see if the Bible is a liar or not. We don&#39;t have much time left before these things come to pass.</p>

<p>Economic Collapse for America</p>

<p>Nuclear Destruction of America</p>

<p>EU Will Flip On America</p>

<p>Introduction of the Mark of The Beast (slowly already happening).</p>

<p>Blacks, Latinos, Native Americans and the Multitude who know they are Israelite&#39;s will be tried (Rex 84/Agenda 21).</p>

<p>Rapture</p>

<p>Global Race Wars</p>

<p>Global Class Wars</p>

<p><strong>Ezekiel 33:33</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.” </p>

<p>Let us see if these things happen, set a reminder for these are the words of God that shall come to pass.</p>

<p>Again, no faith in the word at all. You&#39;ve allowed Satan to become your God. in your mind everything that happens is because of man. While in my mind everything that happens is because of Yahawah, this is why we are different. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science can prove that the first humans were so called black. </p>

<p>Yes I agree the black race was created first. When the Annunaki (predates Bible) came onto earth they mind minerals like good, and precious stones themselves. It started a problem, so they created the black race to work the mines. This took several tries though at creation. The white race was made later as a servant also. To tend the gardens of God. This actually predates the Bible. A lot of the Annunaki tablets became a lot of the Bible.</p>

<p>Those images ancient old show Giants. By simple observation 9. feet is too short. Look up the images of the Annunaki tablets. The gods were I would say at least 15 to 20 feet tall.</p>

<p>And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:</p>

<p>23 Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</p>

<p>24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>

<p>Here he says become one of us, and uses the word cherubim&#39;s gaurding the way. Man has left the garden at this point.. The King of tyrus  was called a cherub. The anointed cherub. Therefore, if cherub was in the garden after man had been banished, a cherub can&#39;t be a man. The king of tyrus would not have been a man by the word of scripture.</p>

<p>Cherub means many things when used in the context of old english.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H3742&amp;amp;t=KJV">https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H3742&amp;amp;t=KJV</a></p>

<p>As for the King of Tyrus being anything other than a man, it is clear that this is metaphoric. He is referencing the spirit of Satan (the serpent) dwelling and influencing the King of Babylon.</p>

<p>Again, this was God admiring his left hand while also condemning it.</p>

<p>According to Strong&#39;s which uses Paeleo Hebrew (predates greece) here is the definition of it.</p>

<p>Strong&#39;s H3742</p>

<p>cherub, cherubim (pl)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>an angelic being</p>

<p>as guardians of Eden</p>

<p>as flanking God&#39;s throne</p>

<p>as an image form hovering over the Ark of the Covenant</p>

<p>as the chariot of Jehovah (fig.)</p>

<p>Strong’s Definitions [?](Strong’s Definitions Legend)
כְּרוּב kᵉrûwb, ker-oob&#39;; of uncertain derivation; a cherub or imaginary figure:—cherub, (plural) cherubims.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Cherubs in the Garden were obviously the chariots (what we call UFO&#39;s today)</p>

<p>The Cherub reference in Ezekiel was a metaphor toward then spirit of Satan which is God&#39;s LEFT hand.</p>

<p>You keep forgetting that God controls both sides.</p>

<p><strong>Isaiah 45:7 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No matter what you try to rationalize ,sir. Cherub means winged angel. If you made a cherub of gold it would be a golden winged object. If it represents a Chariot it has wings. 
Why would you think the ancient primitive man always referenced wings?
Angels always had wings? What to you is this symbolic of?</p>

<p>It means the ability of flight. Wings means flight. A winged angel of god, by the original translations,,  would be- A messenger of God with the ability to fly . Could that be flying in a type of craft? Sure. I don&#39;t believe the angels personally had wings, but had the ability to fly lie birds, when ancient man could only dream of such things, and tried to describe the best they can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not saying that.</p>

<p>The omophagia was the Dionysian act of eating raw flesh and drinking wine to consume the god. Within Orphism, it was believed that consuming the meat and wine was symbolic of the Titans eating the flesh (meat) and blood (wine) of Dionysus and that, by participating in the omophagia, Dionysus&#39; followers could achieve communion with the god.</p>

<p>This pre dates the Jesus bread, and wine rituals.
This isn&#39;t a black Israelites practice. This was a Dionysus practice.</p>

<p>Powell, in particular, argues that precursors to the Catholic notion of transubstantiation can be found in Dionysian religion. </p>

<p>We celebrate Jesus birth the same as Dionysus. </p>

<p>As with Jesus, December 25th and January 6th are both traditional birth dates in the Dionysian myth and simply represent the period of the winter solstice. Indeed, the winter-solstice date of the Greek sun and wine god Dionysus was originally recognized in early January but was eventually placed on December 25th, as related by ancient Latin writer Macrobius (c. 400 AD/CE). Regardless, the effect is the same: The winter sun god is born around this time, when the shortest day of the year begins to become longer. </p>

<p>Jesus and Dionysus are both born of a virgin miraculous birth.</p>

<p>In the common myth about the birth of Dionysus/Bacchus, Semele is mysteriously impregnated by one of Zeus&#39;s bolts of lightning--an obvi­ous miraculous/virgin conception. </p>

<p>The black Israelites would have known that Jesus would turn water to wine at a wedding, when they were captive black Israelites?</p>

<p>The miracles of Dionysus are legendary, as is his role as the god of wine, echoed in the later Christian story of Jesus multiplying the jars of wine at the wedding feast of Cana (Jn 2:1-9). &quot;This story is really the Christian counterpart to the pagan legends of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, who at his annual festival in his temple of Elis filled three empty kettles with wine-no water needed! And on the fifth of January wine instead of water gushed from his temple at Andros. If we believe Jesus&#39; miracle, why should we not believe Dionysus&#39;s? (Leedom, 125) Dionysus&#39;s miracle of changing water to wine is recounted in pre-Christian times by Diodorus.</p>

<p>Dionysus died and resurrected after three days.
Would the black Israelites have known this in captivity long before?</p>

<p>Dionysus a solar hero, born of a virgin on &quot;December 25th&quot; or the winter solstice, performing miracles and receiving divine epithets, being killed, giving his blood as a sacrifice, resurrecting from the dead after three days in Hades/Hell, and ascending into heaven Included in the twelve Olympians, as the last of their number, and the only god born from a mortal mother. The cult of Dionysus is also a &quot;cult of the souls&quot;; his maenads feed the dead through blood-offerings, and he acts as a divine communicant between the living and the dead. He is sometimes categorised as a dying-and-rising god. </p>

<p>Would the captive black isralites have now Jesus was going to be twice born, or teach born again?</p>

<p>A jealous Hera again attempted to kill the child, this time by sending Titans to rip Dionysus to pieces after luring the baby with toys. It is said that he was mocked by the Titans who gave him a thyrsus (a fennel stalk) in place of his rightful sceptre.[21] Zeus turned the Titans into dust with his thunderbolts, but only after the Titans ate everything but the heart, which was saved, variously, by Athena, Rhea, or Demeter. Zeus used the heart to recreate him in his thigh, hence he was again &quot;the twice-born&quot;.</p>

<p>According to a legend, when Alexander the Great reached a city called Nysa near the Indus river, the locals said that their city was founded by Dionysus in the distant past and their city was dedicated to the god Dionysus. These travels took something of the form of military conquests; according to Diodorus Siculus he conquered the whole world except for Britain and Ethiopia.[27] Returning in triumph (he was considered the founder of the triumphal procession) he undertook to introduce his worship into Greece </p>

<p>Would the black captive Israelites have now there coming Messiah would have to travel to and from by boat?</p>

<p>It is a measure of Bacchus&#39;s ambiguous position in classical mythology that he, unlike the other Olympians, had to use a boat to travel to and from the islands with which he is associated&quot; </p>

<p>Would they have now Jesus will bring the dead back to life just like Dionysus?</p>

<p>Dionysus was of the few Olympians with the power to remove deceased mortals from the underworld, and thus restore them to life. He descended to the underworld (Hades) to rescue his mother Semele, whom he had not seen since his birth, making the descent by way of a reputedly bottomless pool on the coast of the Argolid near the prehistoric site of Lerna, and bypassing Thanatos, the god of death. </p>

<p>The Dionysia and Lenaia festivals in Athens were dedicated to Dionysus. On numerous vases (referred to as Lenaia vases), the god is shown participating in the ritual sacrifice as a masked and clothed pillar (sometimes a pole, or tree is used), while his worshipers eat bread and drink wine. </p>

<p>Initiates worshipped him in the Dionysian Mysteries, which were comparable to and linked with the Orphic Mysteries, and may have influenced Gnosticism In the Orphic tradition of ancient Greece, Dionysus Zagreus served as its patron god connected to death and immortality, and symbolized the one who guides reincarnation.</p>

<p>Would they have relayed the story of Jesus and Plate while in captivity?</p>

<p>Many identify both Dionysus and Jesus with the dying-and-returning god In The Bacchae where Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity, which is compared to the New Testament scene of Jesus being interrogated by Pontius Pilate. </p>

<p>Dionysus savior-god whose birth was observed on DEC-25. He was worshipped throughout much of the Middle East as well as in Greece. He had a center of worship in Jerusalem in the 1st century BCE. Some ancient coins were found in Gaza with Dionysus on one side and JHWH (Jehovah) on the other. In later years, his flesh and blood were symbolically eaten in the form of bread and wine. He was viewed as the son of Zeus, the Father God.</p>

<p>Sounds just like Jesus huh?</p>

<p>Yes I told you to worship your pagan religion, that&#39;s what you want do in your heart.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yahawashi was not born on December 25th. That date is a day for Pagans to worship Baal, this is where the writers of the movie <strong>The Purge</strong> got their idea from. When our book was taken and used by others, they incorporated the idea of linking his birthday to this pagan ritual and even took St. Nicks ( A so called black man from Russia who gave toys to orphans) and changed it into Santa (Satan) Clause (Claws).</p>

<p>Yahawashi was born in the spring time, it is spiritual that he would be born during a time of renewal, not in the winter when everything dies.</p>

<p><strong>Luke 2:8 KJV</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</p>

<p>Jesus and Dionysus are both born of a virgin miraculous birth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, wrong. Jesus had a father unlike your Greek savior.</p>

<p>First we simply continue the story the same way it has always been.</p>

<p>God told David that he would send him a <strong>KING THROUGH HIS SEED.</strong>(2 Samuel 7:12-14).</p>

<p>David was of Judah as was Joseph as was Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 1:18-19 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<p>18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, <strong>before they came together,</strong> she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>This is saying that they had no marriage ceremony, it was unbecoming of a woman at this time to have sex before marriage, even though it is sex that confirms a marriage.</p>

<p>19 Then Joseph her husband, <strong>being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.</strong></p>

<p>So grandpa Joe put her away.</p>

<p>Even when Yahawashi goes missing:</p>

<p><strong>Luke 2:48 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>48 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? <strong>behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, referring to Joseph, the virgin birth is a made up conception by the catholic church to worship the woman. Why? Because rebellion, God is a man.</p>

<p><strong>Exodus 15:3 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 The Lord is a <strong>man</strong> of war: the Lord is his name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the rest is bullshit from a King who was known for so much <strong>whitewashing</strong> they literally gave it a term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization">Hellenization</a> hell is the root word. </p>

<p>There is no doubt about it, the so called white man is the strongest, most prideful, most deadly, most cunning predator the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>And even then, I still have faith that the devil shall be brought down from his high places, to worship the feet of those whom they have made small.</p>

<p><strong>Jeremiah 22:13King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>13 <strong>Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness,</strong> and his chambers by wrong; <strong>that useth his neighbour&#39;s service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;</strong></p>

<p>Your attempt to write me off as some sort of common racist is futile. I showed you there are white Israelite&#39;s via video twice. What you are trying to do is put the words of God in a box. I never said there were only Black Israelite&#39;s. The southern kingdoms are black (Benjamin, Levi, Judah). While the other 10 northern tribes (Native Americans, Latinos), left for America long before the southern tribes were forced to come over here. Although brother Gad was a formidable opponent, unlike Judah who was more of a priest, Gad and Ruben would never surrender. Only 5% of my brothers and sisters left.</p>

<p>The sons of God are the angels which the son of man already explained:</p>

<p>These were the sons of Adam the men of Renown were the men who were righteous before the flood I.E. <strong>the elect</strong> who were sealed from the beginning of time. Duh, was this really that  really hard to decipher?</p>

<p><strong>Ephesians 1:4-5</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 According <strong>as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:</strong></p>

<p>5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same souls</p>

<p>Different bodies</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you also blaspheme and not believe there were true giants of stature?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giants as in these men were huge and warrior like, not as in actual giants. Goliath was a giant but he was 15 feet tall. The tallest man to live in our time reached about 9 feet tall I believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you not truly believe that they lived expansive life spans of hundreds of years?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, less pollution and a more pure world would obviously lead to longer lives. Look how Esau coming into power has destroyed the lifespan of man. Again, chemtrails in the air, pesticides all over the food, nuclear radiated seafood, fake food, fake seeds, antibiotic ridden meat, car exhaust, industry smog even the world is has had enough, mother earth is literally about to kill all of us because we have become a virus under the rulership of Edom.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To me you seem to have a hard time believing in the super natural, and try to rationalize everything to fit your paradigm of white, and black</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are the one who doesn&#39;t believe in the spiritual understanding of God. You said so yourself. The problem is, you see the Bible in the flesh (literal only) and I see where there are metaphors and can decipher between the two.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You use the term devil as a name, but we know its not . we&#39;ve been over this. Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour&#39;s service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All Gods other than Yahawah Bahasham Yahawashi are the Devil which is the deceiver. There is no point arguing this with me. You believe what you believe and I will have faith in the father. You can be deceived, I won&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you consider gods work of serving in the natural order of the world, your proper place, as unrighteousness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t, I see that my father had to let his kings become slaves because we would not humble unto his words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You prosper more than your ancestors could have dreamed for their small part. You are being rewarded now. What is so bad about your life?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You cannot see it because of cognitive dissonance but my people suffer under yours. When God comes to establish us our own land and nation once again on earth, then shall we be liberated from the hands of the Devil. Living under the rulership of people that have beaten, raped, killed, slaughtered our ancestors to the point we still walk around with their last names is not free. I don&#39;t even know my real last name, forever cursed to carry the name of the people that destroyed my loved ones. You will never understand this until recompense is paid by the father. You can bet your ass the son of man is on the way to give reward you just as you rewarded us even double.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, reference to Adam, two nations Adam (men) and Eve (women). This is how Cain found a wife, that was not his mother.</p>

<p>The word of god is not so cut and dry, because just like the serpent race, giants are in every religion, and account of history for every civilization that has ever lived on earth. Some that are so old they predate the bible by a long shot . </p>

<p>Hey, look. I really do have some respect for a good black person. If to believe the Bible, and be a good Christian , you have to make it a black god, then fine. I&#39;m all for it.

<p>Also:</p>

<p><strong>Romans 12:19King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 10:16 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>16 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This truth makes you feel different about things.</p>

<p><strong>John 8:32 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have to ask yourself: </p>

<p>All these so called poor black,Hispanic,native american,whites sitting on these corners yelling to society that the world is ending and nothing happens to them. The police literally watch them at times screaming about how the white man is the devil and go into all this stuff about our government being corrupt and do nothing. People walk by get into debates with them, sometimes heated arguments just because they read something from the Bible. It&#39;s interesting to watch, I&#39;ve heard no reports from any of the camps of someone coming up and trying to fatally hurt them or anything. What is protecting them? Those were the thoughts that were running through my head when I first understood what they were claiming. How do they have so much faith in something that could only <em>possibly</em> exists. How did they have that much faith in the words of some old book translated a million times? Why did it even survive?</p>

<p>That&#39;s when I decided to read for myself using their concept, I had to see what they were talking about. It began to make sense and I&#39;ve been studying ever since.</p>

<p>Is it coincidence that the first amendment would protect them? I don&#39;t think so. I think the freedom of speech was a gift from God just as much as I think the 2nd amendment is a gift to Esau.</p>

<p>One son was created to use peace (Jacob)</p>

<p>One son was created to use war (Esau)</p>

<p>Order comes from Jacob</p>

<p>Chaos comes from Esau</p>

<p>Maybe you just can&#39;t imagine real Giants, or god Kings with supernatural powers, etc., but I can , and I know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said Giants didn&#39;t exist, I said it was not the size of a fairy tale giant.  </p>

<p>Nine feet tall is very tall. But it seemed like you were trying to describe giants the size of buildings, which would be wrong.</p>

<p>I also never once said that supernatural powers didn&#39;t exist. I mentioned that the renowned men were the spirits of the elect who were here from the beginning. Those spirits were the pre-cursor (before the flood) to the physical manifestation shells which would be called Israel. For God chose Israel.</p>

<p><strong>Deuteronomy 32:9</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For the LORD&#39;S portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is said that the elect will receive spiritual powers over the elements and make war with the nations alongside Yahawashi.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 24:31 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2 Esdras 2:42-43</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>42 I Esdras saw upon the mount Sion a great people, whom I could not number, and they all praised the Lord with songs.</p>

<p>43 <strong>And in the midst of them there was a young man of a high stature, taller than all the rest, and upon every one of their heads he set crowns, and was more exalted; which I marvelled at greatly.</strong></p>

<p>Now if you are speaking about your Greek doctrine again, I cannot listen for I know that it is false.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is your take on the pyramids of Egypt? Do you believe these are man made, or some thing else made them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know and honestly don&#39;t care, it is not of importance just as if the earth is flat. It changes nothing to know.</p>

<p>Again, you misunderstand, God chose the elect from the beginning as I&#39;ve already told you. He controls both the Angels (Right) and the Demons (Left).</p>

<p>Why would I be branded as a heretic when it clear that even the messiah himself spoke of reincarnation and waiting on the spirit of Elias to return inside the shell that was John the Baptist?</p>

<p>12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 11:13-15</strong></p>

<p><strong>Matthew 17:11</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“And Jesus answered and said unto them, <strong>Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.”</strong> </p>

<p>Was not Elias dead hundreds of years before Yahawashi?</p>

<p>Ah does that solve our current reality of all the greatest nations on earth building tanks, missiles, guns and even more destructive nuclear bombs? Will it stop the world from heading toward nuclear war? Is that the greatest knowledge on the earth? Will that solve the coming destruction? Will God say &quot;hey they figured out the knowledge of the pyramids, let&#39;s not continue with prophecy&quot;.</p>

<p>No it won&#39;t.</p>

<p><strong>1 Corinthians 3:19 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know there is an opposing white doctrine to your black is god religion right? </p>

<p>I</p>

<p>God&#39;s first Divine Law, when He created the earth and everything upon it, was everything after its kind whose seed is in itself. He states this very clearly ten times in the first chapter of Genesis. It applies to all living matter, even vegetable.</p>

<p>Genesis 1:11: &quot;And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.&quot;</p>

<p>Genesis 1:12: &quot;And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.&quot;</p>

<p>Genesis 1:21: &quot;And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.&quot;</p>

<p>Genesis 1:24: &quot;And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and Beast of the Earth after his kind: and it was so.&quot;</p>

<p>Genesis 1:25: &quot;And God made the Beast of the Earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.&quot;</p>

<p>In Genesis 1:27-31, it says God created male and female, tells them to be fruitful, multiply and have dominion over every living thing, and God beheld everything that He had made and it was good. Everything that God made has its seed within itself, therefore it is good because it produces only its own kind. Like begets like. Never do the simpler forms of life violate this law unless forced to by the higher form, man.</p>

<p>When different races mix, they do not bring forth their own kind; their offspring are mongrels or hybrids. This is a transgression against Divine Law, upsetting Nature&#39;s delicate balance and producing that which is not good. Little wonder that, so often in the past, God has destroyed His own children for mongrelizing, and, you can be sure, He will again.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 7:6: &quot;For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.&quot; The Adamic Race is to have dominion over every form of life previously created. This includes not only the four legged beasts, but the two legged as well. The Negro is an articulate member of this Beast Creation. For proof that they are beasts, and God calls them exactly that.</p>

<p>Exodus 23:10-11: &quot;And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof: But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.&quot;</p>

<p>If wild or even domesticated animals were beasts of the field, just picture what would happen to your gardens and vineyards. Note the distinction God makes here between the &quot;poor of thy people&quot; and the &quot;beasts of the field&quot; the poor of thy people shall eat first.</p>

<p>Exodus 9:9: &quot;And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.&quot;
You can be sure God was not punishing four legged beasts by afflicting them with boils.</p>

<p>Leviticus 20:15-16: &quot;And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.&quot;</p>

<p>This certainly could not be a four legged beast that a man or woman could lie with. If it were, God would not demand the death penalty for a dumb animal with no reasoning power.</p>

<p>Exodus 19:13: &quot;There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.&quot;
Now we have a beast with a hand. Do you believe God told Moses to talk to the camels, donkeys, cattle and tell them not to touch the mount?</p>

<p>Jeremiah 7:20: &quot;Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast...&quot;
Jeremiah 21:6: &quot;And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.&quot;
Would God refer to a four legged beast as an inhabitant of a city?</p>

<p>Jeremiah 27:6: &quot;And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.&quot;
The Negro race has always been used as servants.</p>

<p>Jeremiah 31:27-30: &quot;...the seed of man, and with the seed of beast...But every one shall die for his own iniquity.&quot;
How can an animal die for his sins and iniquity? They cannot because they do not know God’s Laws so they cannot sin.</p>

<p>Jeremiah 31:34: &quot;And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.&quot;</p>

<p>Ezekiel 14:15: &quot;If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts.&quot;
Only two legged beasts could stop man from passing through the land.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 29:11: &quot;No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.&quot;
Now the beast inhabitant not only has a hand but a foot as well. Animals have hoofs or paws.</p>

<p>Jonah 3:7-8: &quot;Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.&quot;
What manner of beast would wear sackcloth; have the power of speech and, once again, we see that the beast has hands?</p>

<p>Zechariah 8:10: &quot;For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast...&quot;
Here we have beasts that can be hired.
The great boast of modern civilization is its unparalleled degree of enlightenment when compared with preceding ages. While marvelous advances have been made in the realm of many sciences, in other respects we are still groping about in a clouded maze of misconceptions. Colleges and universities have been taken over by aliens and are teaching as truth philosophies which have no substance in actual fact.</p>

<p>For example, because the doctrines of the atheistic school of natural development are accepted as the acme of scholarship, specifically the theory of the evolution of the species, the door to understanding has been fastened shut in regard to the true origin of the races.</p>

<p>The Bible stands as an impregnable bulwark against today&#39;s modern slogan that all men, regardless of color, are blood brothers. The patriarchs of the Bible, the prophets of old, the apostles of the early Christian Church, do not support this view. Nevertheless, under the operation of the Law of the Lord, all are entitled to equality of justice and righteousness in judgment. </p>

<p>The simple truth regarding the origin of the races demonstrates conclusively that the Negroes and the White Race do not have a common ancestry.</p>

<p>A full grasp of this fact will go a long way toward solving racial problems which are menacing the entire world today. When the undeniable truth is known and acted upon, it will bring about an abrupt and complete cessation of the present attempt to elevate the colored races or Jews to positions of authority over those whom the Lord instructed: &quot;Thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother.&quot;</p>

<p>So we respectfully ask that you bring to this study an open mind in search of truth. And we feel that if you do you will find that a careful weighing of the evidence presented herein will result in an astounding comprehension of aspects of the story the Bible tells which has long been hidden from view</p>

<p>He never wanted it, all your people care about is the Matrix. You have to conquer everything because naturally that&#39;s what you were made for.

<p>Here the morning stars sing together. Is this not symbolic of the angels? Angels are stars that fall, or morning stars. Stars withing the firmament are lights for navigation, signs, and wonders.</p>

<p>When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have to stop pulling from Job without the full context because Job is one of the most metaphoric books in the scriptures. </p>

<p>The morning star is a reference to those who hold power in the heavens. The spirit of Satan as I&#39;ve mentioned before works for God. As I&#39;ve also mentioned before, Satan is God&#39;s creation and everything he does is because Yahawah instructed him to do so.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the start of the book you pulled this from. </p>

<p><strong>Job 1:6-12 KJV</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>6 Now there was a day <em>when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we see that the Israelite&#39;s go to talk to God, Satan comes along with them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 <em>And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>God even asks Satan, where are you coming from? Satan replies from going throughout the world trying men, which is exactly what Satan was created by God to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>8 And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</p>

<p>9 Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</p>

<p>10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</p>

<p>11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</p>

<p>12 And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yahawah and Satan even go into a full blown conversation about one of the elect (JOB). Satan even goes on to say, &quot;you put a protection around him, that&#39;s why he&#39;s so blessed&quot; let me see if I can try him.</p>

<p>This shows us that Satan is controlled by God. Meaning Satan is God&#39;s top angel on the LEFT side, while Christ is his top angel on the RIGHT.</p>

<p>Will Christ rule over Satan? Of course he will because he is/will be the brightest morning star.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation 2:26-28</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</p>

<p>27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</p>

<p>28 And I will give him the morning star.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Revelation 22:16 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.</p>

<p>This is true but we&#39;ve only discussed parts of the Bible that literally interpret themselves. All of this has been bread, not one peice of actual meat has been discussed which is how I know I am dealing with someone who has not read the Bible from front to back.</p>

<p>Anyone with even a small understanding of the entire story would say to themselves holy crap, this book is about a ancient global space spiritual race war.</p>

<p>Literally where Geroge Lucas got his ideas from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That would be an angel then. What the hell are you arguing about?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am arguing that Satan is not in the sky and that he is here on earth. He will not fall from heaven physically in the end times which is what you keep talking about. Since Satan is here on earth, the metaphor is meant to show that Satan (Rothschild) will fall from <strong>POWER</strong> in the end times.</p>

<p>Wrong. I agree Satan is here. I said Apollo will come down from heaven during tribulations . although I don&#39;t believe in end times, or rapture,etc. I know people like you do. Revelation is to reveal not the end. For the world abideth forever. </p>

<p>Is Rothschild in the bible then you are condemned as a heritic. Like you told me. Why equate Rothschild with the devil when Rothschild is never once mentioned. </p>

<p>You are adding, and taking from scripture.</p>

<p>How does one argue about the Bible but not actually believe the things written inside of it? Amazing. You don&#39;t believe in the end times when both the Old, Apocrypha and New Testament all talk about it? That&#39;s probably because you&#39;re Esau.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 49:11 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>11 <strong>Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever,</strong> and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.</p>

<p>Yeah right. What is of the spirit is of the spirit, and flesh of the flesh you did nothing but entertain the craziness in your mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>1 Corinthians 4:10King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>10 <strong>We are fools for Christ&#39;s sake,</strong> but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.</p>

<p>Is Rothschild in the bible then you are condemned as a heritic. Like you told me. Why equate Rothschild with the devil when Rothschild is never once mentioned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because their family is the richest on the planet who gained their wealth by funding the Transatlantic Slave Trade, the biggest atrocity ever committed by man.</p>

<p>4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how I know you are a deceiver, you quote the Bible but give no precept/chapter numbers. Because you think I won&#39;t go and grab the context of the information you present. But I will anyways.</p>

<p>First off this is correct way to present a precept.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 5:22</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who is Yahawashi coming to save?</p>

<p>Lets find it:</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 15:24 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>24 But he answered and said, <strong>I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>John 4:22King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: <strong>for salvation is of the Jews.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who did Paul Pray for?</p>

<p><strong>Romans 9:2-5</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.</p>

<p>3 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ <strong>for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:</strong></p>

<p>4 <strong>Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;</strong></p>

<p>5 <strong>Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we have this reoccurring narrative that salvation will only be to the Israelite&#39;s throughout the entire Bible and yet for some reason, it doesn&#39;t sink in for some, certainly not Esau who seeks it carefully with tears. </p>

<p>In other words, Christ was talking about <strong>THE 12 TRIBES OF ISRAEL.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here is the judgement for Edom</strong></p>

<p><strong>Isaiah 14:21-22King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.</p>

<p>22 For I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Psalm 137 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 <strong>Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.</strong></p>

<p>8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.</p>

<p>9 <strong>Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Is Esau still Jacobs brother? Let&#39;s Find Out:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Amos 1:9</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; <strong>because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, it is good nature for my people to be happy that we are even alive in these times for these are times that the prophets themselves dreamed of.</p>

<p><strong>2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>6 <strong>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;</strong></p>

<p>7 And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,</p>

<p>8 <strong>In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong></p>

<p>9 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;</p>

<p>10 When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amen, Selah.</p>

<p>They worship anything that is not Yahawah. It could be a rock or that god forsaken cross (wood) for all they care. As long as it isn&#39;t the true God of the Bible.</p>

<p>To teach us something as we are about to be the rulers of this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>15 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:</p>

<p>Notice how it is mention that IT WILL COME TO PASS not if.</p>

<p>The LORD likened his people unto a whore, who went praising after other gods one after another.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If god gave Adam dominion over earth he must be white, cause that is who has dominion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adam is gone, after the world was cleansed, God made new plans.</p>

<p><strong>Deuteronomy 32:8</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, *<em>he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.” *</em></p>

<p>At this point in bible and our time, the living power gave all of his wisdom to the nation of Israel. This would be his last covenant according to the Bible. As it is mentioned CHRIST will rule for ever and ever.</p>

<p>Yes, the European race, not all but majority all go back to Edom. There are some so called white people who&#39;s ancestors going back on their fathers side are themselves Israelite&#39;s.</p>

<p>Tell me, do you think that a people with no power, no military, no knowledge of self can actually be racist toward another race? No. I can call you whatever the hell I wanted and at the end of the day, your foot is still on my throat via your leaders.</p>

<p>Is God not a racist if he said he has chosen only one group of people out of the whole world?</p>

<p><strong>2 Esdras 6:56</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“As for the other people which also come of Adam, <strong>thou hast said that they are nothing, but be like vnto spittle,</strong> and hast likened the abundance of them vnto a drop that falleth from a vessell.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the other nations but the Israelite&#39;s are nothing but spit in God&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 147:19-20King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>19 <strong>He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.</strong></p>

<p>20 <strong>He hath not dealt so with any nation:</strong> and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Deuteronomy 32:8</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, <strong>he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2 Esdras Chapter 5:21-27</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>21 And after seven days so it was, that the thoughts of my heart were very grievous unto me again,</p>

<p>22 And my soul recovered the spirit of understanding, and I began to talk with the most High again,</p>

<p>23 And said, O Lord that bearest rule, of every wood of the earth, and of all the trees thereof, thou hast chosen thee one only vine:</p>

<p>24 And of all lands of the whole world thou hast chosen thee one pit: and of all the flowers thereof one lily:</p>

<p>25 And of all the depths of the sea thou hast filled thee one river: and of all builded cities thou hast hallowed Sion unto thyself:</p>

<p>26 And of all the fowls that are created thou hast named thee one dove: and of all the cattle that are made thou hast provided thee one sheep:</p>

<p>27 And among all the multitudes of people thou hast gotten thee one people: and unto this people, whom thou lovedst, thou gavest a law that is approved of all.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>How can this be when it clear the sons of Judah were black?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moses was born a Hebrew – Israelite from the tribe of Levi (Exodus 2:1-3). He spent 40 years in the House of Pharaoh (Acts 7:23) and from the time he was an infant, passed as the Pharaoh’s grandson (Exodus 2: 6, 10). This was during the same time that Pharaoh ordered all Hebrew males under the age of two to be killed. So, if Pharaoh, was a black-skinned descendant of Khawm / Ham, which he was, it would of course follow that Moses was black-skinned also.</p>

<p>Moses was raised in the house of Pharaoh, as the grandson of Pharaoh, when Pharaoh ordered all other Hebrew males to be killed at birth. If the Israelites were a white-skinned people, how could Moses the Hebrew survive (secretly) in the house of Pharaoh among black-skinned Egyptians for 40 years, and not be noticed. Scripture tells us that Moses killed an Egyptian, after he saw him mistreating a Hebrew. So Moses had to flee from Egypt for his life because Pharaoh found out and sought to kill him (Exodus 2:12-15).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moses fled to the land of Midian where he helped seven daughters of the priest of Midian water their flock, after chasing away some bully shepherds. The girls went home to their father, Reuel and told him what happened.</p>

<p>They told him that an EGYPTIAN saved them and watered their flock (Exodus 2:16-19). Notice they didn’t say a Hebrew in Egyptian clothing saved us, and they described Moses as a black-skinned descendant of Ham (Egyptian).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Acts 21:38
“Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the &gt;wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even the messiah himself, was a dark skinned man.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation 1:14-15</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>14 His head and his hairs were white like <strong>wool,</strong> as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</p>

<p>15 <strong>And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace;</strong> and his voice as the sound of many waters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear who has the nappy wooly hair in the world. It is also clear that if we took a peice of brown brass and tossed it into a furnace and pulled it out, it would be an even darker brown.</p>

<p>The proof is in the poetry my friend.</p>

<p>But again I know why you don&#39;t understand :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.</p>

<p>2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.</p>

<p>3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?</p>

<p>4 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Obadiah 1:15</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>15 For the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet the prophecies continue to pass? The only book in the world that has proven itself over and over? </p>

<p>Are not the armies of the world gathering in the middle east?</p>

<p><strong>Joel 3King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He will free us from your bonds</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He will gather all the armies of the world to show them that they are fighting over something that doesn&#39;t even belong to them and also remind all 17 nations what they did long ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have sold his children as slaves, even sold the young men of Israel to be whores to slave masters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even asking nations like the Philitines, what have you to do with my land? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>5 Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They took everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6 The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They sold us to the great white conquerors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He will bring us back into the land eventually.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation 11:14</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.” </p>

You need to quit interpreting the bible as you see fit, and read it for what it says. Like Satan the devil the great dragon that old serpent is just that a serpent, snake. Have you been so propagandized you can&#39;t simply read the bible for what it says, not what you think your interpretation means. Maybe we should all do a lot less interpreting and start taking the bible for what it says. You can rebell all you want from the white man. No black god will save you.

<p>Again, you can&#39;t see it because you have no soul. You cannot commit sin for you are already damned. </p>

<p>The only nation on the planet that can commit sin are the sons of Israel.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 147:19-20King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.</p>

<p>20 <strong>He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the Lord.</strong></p>

<p>Again, I understand you cannot understand this. What I will tell you is to live it up in this reality, because soon Edom will be making his move on the children of God and then comes the ancient one to avenge his people. </p>

<p>Again, there is nothing you nor I can do to stop this. </p>

<p>We will see world war three</p>

<p>We will see class/race wars</p>

<p>We will see people killing over loafs of bread</p>

<p>We will see nations rise against nation</p>

<p>we will see kingdoms rise again kingdoms</p>

<p>All of this and more when the day of Yahawah comes to pass. </p>

<p>Some Christians will be irked by your mixing of religion and myth, but I think it&#39;s a valid practice in order to figure out what is going on.  I am starting to think the whole reality we are presented with, from news, science, sports, mainstream events etc is totally symbolic. </p>

<p>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you heard of Melek Taus, the Peacock god of the Yazidis? </p>

<p>&quot;The Yazidi consider Tawûsê Melek an emanation of God and a good, benevolent angel who has redeemed himself from his fall and has become a demiurge who created the cosmos from the Cosmic egg. After he repented, he wept for 7,000 years, his tears filling seven jars, which then quenched the fires of hell. Yazidis believe Tawûsê Melek is not a source of evil or wickedness. They consider him to be the leader of the archangels, not a still-fallen nor a still-disgraced angel, but a forgiven one and an emanation of God himself.&quot;</p>

<p>This peacock symbolism also parallels that of the phoenix. But I thought the phoenix was associated with Ra. Is Ra Lucifer? Jesus and the Archangel Michael were also often depicted with peacock feathers. </p>

<p>I was under the impression that Ra was the sun (good), Saturn was karma (natural law) and Venus was Lucifer (autistic). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Melek taus I&#39;m not that familiar with enough to discuss, but I&#39;ll look into it. Amen-ra is Zeus. Venus is Aphrodite, she gets mixed with Lucifer a lot of times. Aphrodite would be ishtar. All the angels , or gods are referred to as stars symbolically in the bible. The ancient people would also mix gods. What is better than one gods favor? Multiple gods favor. I personally can&#39;t tell you what to believe. I am telling you what the illuminati believe, but you are definitely on the right track, and I&#39;ll look more into Yazidi. I haven&#39;t gave it much effort, but I&#39;m sure there is a lot of significance in it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet the prophecies continue to pass? The only book in the world that has proven itself over and over? </p>

<p>Are not the armies of the world gathering in the middle east?</p>

<p><strong>Joel 3King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He will free us from your bonds</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He will gather all the armies of the world to show them that they are fighting over something that doesn&#39;t even belong to them and also remind all 17 nations what they did long ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have sold his children as slaves, even sold the young men of Israel to be whores to slave masters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even asking nations like the Philitines, what have you to do with my land? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>5 Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They took everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6 The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They sold us to the great white conquerors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He will bring us back into the land eventually.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation 11:14</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.” </p>
