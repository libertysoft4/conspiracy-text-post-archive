<p>1.They are dismissive, sometimes in a very obnoxious way.</p>

<p>2.They will try to shut down your narrative by repeatedly demanding proof.</p>

<p>Edit: (a little late for Clarity on this but fuck it) example of this would be maybe the Vegas shooting, OP would connect the dots to their own Theory and the whole post be shot down because people would be dismissing it wanting proof, where there of course wasn&#39;t any. That&#39;s not fair. Maybe that OP was on to something. Sometimes those demands are ridiculous. Sometimes it&#39;s suspicious. I believe it&#39;s a tactic they use to derail a possible true.</p>

<p>3.They will not and possibly cannot agree with you on conspiracies widely accepted to be true. At this point I would ask myself why are you here if you don&#39;t a LEAST believe in that? Usually the conversation won&#39;t continue after probing one of these questions.</p>

<p>Young Reddit age, high Karma? Possibly (They&#39;re obviously supporting each other. Maybe reddit is supporting them also) </p>

<p>Of course we can&#39;t go around calling people shills. I&#39;d look through their comments and try to pieced together what the accounts narrative is.</p>

<p>Please share if you notice anything else. </p>

<p>Edit: What is happening here is interesting. It&#39;s hard to gauge my tone through text so I just want to say I came to the sub to be convinced and educated. There&#39;s huge variety of people here with a wide diversity of knowledge much greater than I. I will certainly concede to a good argument because that&#39;s progress for me. That&#39;s the way it should work.</p>

<p>Edit: And Im grateful this post reached as many eyes as a did.</p>

There&#39;s nothing we can do about it. Can&#39;t call them out and can&#39;t report them anyway unless they blatantly break some rule. Even if their contributions here are mostly to continually use ad hominem attacks, make comments solely to discredit every conspiracy and insult users. As long as they don&#39;t blatantly break rule 10 by doing so. 
I&#39;ve reported a few that continually harass me through pm to the admins, they don&#39;t care. I have no doubt at this point that they&#39;re complicit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ask for evidence all the time too, it isn&#39;t the same thing. It is the way they do it. Like say I make a post about a wild theory I came up with, and I lay out all the dots I think are connected, and ask the sub what they think. The shills will come into shit like that telling OP he is a liar piece of shit unless he posts evidence. They ask for evidence when it is obvious based on the premise that there isn&#39;t any. There are plenty of babies that get thrown out with bathwater around here, for sure.

<p>The intentions are clear with these political conspiracy theories. There&#39;s no intention to show evidence. That&#39;s where the malicious calling out is from. It&#39;s not shills.

    <div class="md"><p>Its a fucking conspiracy forum. Clearly there isn&#39;t always going to be proof of every claim. That doesn&#39;t mean the claims are untrue, just that they aren&#39;t <em>proven</em>, something pretty common in the conspiracy world. I don&#39;t know why this concept is so fucking difficult for people to understand, its so simple.</p>

<p>The main argument I see against any of the Trump Russia stuff or the DNC hacking is &quot;but where is the evidence?&quot; </p>

<p>So does that mean that all those people are shills? Nah. There are also plenty of snarky people on reddit. I don&#39;t assume anyone who I argue with is getting paid to have an opinion. I&#39;d rather just present a decent argument as to why I disagree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think people get into these debates with the intention of changing minds, a lot of the time it&#39;s for the onlookers. Not saying minds can&#39;t be changed or that that&#39;s not ever the motive. I think providing sources shouldn&#39;t be a problem for someone who is secure in their beliefs, and they shouldn&#39;t just be dismissed as shills. It just seems like an easy cop out. Again, this is just my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it&#39;s more about awareness. Some pointed out the pointlessness and I agree. I expected to get chewed up. Oh well. It&#39;s a tactic it seems. Of course asking for Source isn&#39;t only used by Shills. I should have probably had more clarity on that too bad the entire thread was based on that line. I appreciate the reply to the reply.

<p>For pointing out CTR shills? Really? If so, you should post some of those instead of this limp wristed list.</p>

<p>Because you dominate the sub, try to erase independents, and lie constantly about being oppressed by &quot;Donald 2.0&quot;, a provably false narrative. The nonstop, hyperpartisan Democrat circle jerk has done far, far more damage to this sub that bots upvoting shit from the Donald.</p>

<p>You guys have actually ruined the sub, while blaming republicans for everything and accusing independents and moderates of being secret Trump supporters.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never had a trump supporter accuse me of being a secret leftist for disagreeing with them. I have, however, been called a nazi, a trump tard, and a shill by democrats because I dared to be critical of their side.</p>

<p>It&#39;s especially annoying because I have historically leaned democrat. Registered independent who&#39;s voted Democrat twice and Republican not once in my life. But according to &quot;liberal users&quot;, I&#39;m a fucking nazi.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Right in the beginning of my comment I state it&#39;s fucked up what the democrats are doing. It&#39;s highly hypocritical and I don&#39;t think DACA and dreamers is worth shutting down the government for. It was fucked up when the republicans did it, and it&#39;s fucked up when the democrats do it.</p>

<p>You say that you&#39;re against extreme partisanship, but yet you are attacking me for pointing it out when a conservative user is doing it.  And the only reason why I pointed out his right wing stance is because of the comment I was replying to. Read it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;CTR shills is a fact. But so are conservative shills, and the right wing propagandists try to pretend it’s not happening.&quot; Whataboutism for CTR</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly is the issue here? I acknoweldge the existence of CTR shills and even point out that it&#39;s a fact that they exist because their own website acknoweldges it, which liberals and shills try to ignore or say that CTR shills don&#39;t exist. Were you hoping others would not read my comments and just rely on what you had to say about them?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agreed&quot; you agreed that Clinton has collapsed on camera before, while arguing that Bernie didn&#39;t stand a chance in the same thread, which is veiled apologetics/deflections for DNC fuckery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agreed that she collapsed on camera implying that I agreed there was something wrong with her. And the DNC did fuck over Sanders. That has nothing to do with my reasoning that Trump would have still won. And I used evidence to back up that claim because there was a senator in Wisconsin that had the same exact views and policies as Sanders, and was one of the only ones to vote against the Iraq/Afghanistan war. But, he still lost, which means that Sanders would have most likely lost Wisconsin and Michigan, which means he would have lost the electorally. You again try to purposely misintrepret what I was saying with what I assume is hoping that people just rely on your interpretation of my comment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Has nothing to do with dems or republicans since you don&#39;t assign blame and stay vague as usual</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait, so now you&#39;re attacking me because my comment has nothing to do with democrats or republicans? I thought all of my comments were pro democrat and anti Trump? The title was the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What are some secret military technologies that we probably know exist? And what are some that might exist, that we have no idea about? I mean trillions of dollars went missing, I’m sure they’ve got some pretty crazy stuff. What do you think?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then I responded with this comment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m betting full battle suit armor with camo, and smart weapon technology not that different from a few sci fi shows.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also betting they are working on AI technology to build robots for the future wars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How was I being vauge when I was directly responding to the topic and keeping it on point? Again, you try to mislead my comments were about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Oprah is as shitty as trump&quot; anti Trump comment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what if I&#39;m anti Trump. I still think that Oprah would be a shitty president and it&#39;s fucking dumb how all of the stupid liberals, even some liberal pod casters that I enjoy listening to, have practically endorsed her to run. My comment was the very definition of anti-partisanship because I attacked both sides. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I posted that comment to show again that not all of my comments have anything to do with republicans/democrats/Trump. I was even corrected and I admitted that I was wrong and that I need to brush up on my history more and I thanked him for correcting me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to be high. Promltion of DACA</p>

<p>Again, I posted that comment to show that I don&#39;t only talk about democrats or republicans. I was stating that from personal experience that a big problem with VA assistance is that a lot of veterans don&#39;t seek help, especially with the older vets. And what exactly is wrong with me supporting DACA? You again ignored the context of what I was saying. </p>

<p>What are you talking about? I stated that I don&#39;t think there is an IG investigation that I was aware of.He proved me wrong, and I said &quot;Cool thanks.&quot; I did respond to him.

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t blame republicans for everything and I never accussed independents and moderates of being secret Trump supporters. Democrats have a lot to blame for our societal issues. Just look at how the democrats and Clinton threw tens of thousands of minorities in jail and destroying families, or how Hillary Clinton called black youths &quot;super predators&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve never had a trump supporter accuse me of being a secret leftist for disagreeing with them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with being a leftist just as much as there is nothing wrong with being a conservative. I&#39;m a liberal and not ashamed of that. But, from what I&#39;ve seen from your history, you mostly only engage with liberal minded people and make accusations and harass them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have, however, been called a nazi, a trump tard, and a shill by democrats because I dared to be critical of their side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s wrong and hypocritical of them. We need to be able to have more sincere honest and civil discussions. I have a best friend who is a conservative republican, and he&#39;s one of the smartest people I know. He puts me to constant shame when I try to debate with him on stuff, but we always kept it civil. He works in the DC area, and he tells me how he has to hide his political identity because liberals would attack him in a hateful rude manner. That kind of shit really pisses me off. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t do that. I&#39;ve said a few comments where you first started talking with me about, but I never accused this place of being Donald 2.0 or attack independents. I have always been civil with every single person that I&#39;ve disagreed with. And when we did discuss this point before, you were able to prove your point, and I&#39;ve since noticed that on the front page, it&#39;s full of mostly liberal minded people. I think my view was wrong because I just tend to notice to same handful of conservatives in new and rising, because that&#39;s where I mostly hang out at. Confirmation bias clouded my judgement.</p>

<p>Again, that&#39;s wrong, and I&#39;m sorry that happens to you. But, it&#39;s hard to take you seriously when you say you&#39;re against extreme partisanship but you only attack liberal users and let other conservative users go when they constantly spam their political stuff as well. </p>

<p>No matter what &quot;evidence&quot; you give, you don&#39;t know that. And, by making it seem like no big deal because it wouldn&#39;t have changed the outcome of the election, according to you, you are just running interference for DNC fuckery which should be scrutinized <em>heavily</em>.</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t you the guy who is freaking out because i didn&#39;t quote you exactly or accurately enough? I said your account is <em>virtually</em> all pro Democrat and anti GOP. Proving me wrong would be showing comments you&#39;ve made either doing apologetics for GOP or making anti-democrat comments</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How was I being vauge</p>

<p>Because you don&#39;t indicate who you think is responsible for this. One party? Both parties? Independents in Congress?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a superfluous comment. It&#39;s like how some of my top rated comments on this sub are taking apart the 440hz is evil theory... it doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with my &quot;bias&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My comment was the very definition of anti-partisanship because I attacked both sides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She has no support from the establishment. An attack on Oprah is not an attack on the democrats. Just like how an attack on Trump in 2016 was not an attack on republicans, considering many republicans openly hated him. So, all that comment is is an anti-trump comment, and it was one of your examples of how you&#39;re not just an anti Trump type poster.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>not all of my comments have anything to do with republicans/democrats/Trump</p>

<p>Yet you still applied your liberal bias to the comment! Fucking hell, man. This is so simple I&#39;m kind of astounded. </p>

<p>You posted a comment about your support of a controversial Democrat-pushed policy... to show that you aren&#39;t hyperpartisan? Whaaaa? And, for the record, there&#39;s nothing really wrong with DACA. The comment is simply another example of how your comments all fall into the same categories: Democrat stuff good, trump/GOP bad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, to show that I don&#39;t only talk about Trump/republicans/democrats, etc. </p>

<p>Wtf? This just seems like a clumsy effort to say something you think a non-partisan would say. Also, the for-profit prison industry gives far more money to Republican lawmakers. Clearly right wing drug policies have contributed to this just as badly if not worse. Being non partisan means you put fault where fault is due, regardless of party lines.</p>

<p>And you can&#39;t imagine why, when my highest rated comments on this sub are the ones where I criticize Trump and GOP c onmen like Ryan?</p>

<p>You cant imagine the frustration in constantly being told I&#39;m a Trump supporter, and that anything negative about Trump will get you downvoted and banned by the mods because this is Donald 2.0? It&#39;s literal gaslighting. You cant see how my ire would be directed at the people responsible for fabricating such absolute horseshit... horseshit that ruins just about every single post made to this sub? You really can&#39;t fathom why, as a guy who&#39;s leaned democrat and actually voted Democrat a couple times, I would be <em>more</em> pissed at the party I actually had a modicum of faith in at one point, because the hardliners of that party have declared me an enemy for saying, &quot;the democrats have problems&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he tells me how he has to hide his political identity because liberals would attack him in a hateful rude manner</p>

<p>I studied politics in college, so I have many friends who work in DC and are extremely politically literate, just like your friend. The conservatives I know are in the same predicament as your friend. The liberals I know are not. And guess What? The independents I know <em>are</em>! Liberal shaming is out of fucking control. I barely recognize the damn party anymore. This sub is a microcosm of that environment, and the fact people like you deny it is is just ridiculous. Hence my ridicule.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying posting a comment where you call out a Democrat shill would go a longer way than this absurdly objectionable list. In fact, you kight just blow the doors off my argument completely. Something tells me, maybe I&#39;m wrong, that you were calling out Trump shills and letting the dem shills slide.</p>

<p>You know What? I might be guilty of letting questionable pro-trump accounts slide, here. I already explained my reasoning, though. The Trumptards usually don&#39;t respond, and they are usually downvoted to oblivion already. The left wing attack dogs, on the other hand...</p>

<p>Okay. I give you an immense amount of appreciation for saying that. Thank you. It honestly makes me feel good to know that I helped raise awareness of an issue that is important to me. </p>

<p>Alright, maybe I was wrong about the extent of your partisanship if you are willing to see things from another perspective. Maybe I am wrong to lump you in with the toxic members of this sub who use the insults you are denouncing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>conservative users go when they constantly spam their political stuff as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, their shit gets downvoted, though. Democrat stuff is front page, hundred of upvotes type stuff. Democrat downvote brigades are way worse than the donbot ones ever were. Axylotl peyotl or whatever his name is, i don&#39;t really agree with him, but I&#39;m pretty sure he has people following him around 24/7 downvoting everything he posts. That&#39;s fucked. And he&#39;s a mod, which goes against the &quot;Russian mods banning all dissent&quot; narrative.</p>

<p>Plus, the Donald 2.0 narrative, as I said, just pisses me off. The right wing narratives like pizzagate and Seth rich, are much easier for me to not give a shit about because its much more speculative and for all intents and purposes has no data behind it. Donald 2.0 rebuttal data is the front page. People&#39;s comment histories. </p>

<p>Look, man, I&#39;ll admit that I might have been wrong about you. If you&#39;re really not like the circlejerkers on the front page, then I apologize. I don&#39;t want to lump you with them if you genuinely don&#39;t deserve it. There were simply some things I interpreted as red flags, per se, in our earlier conversation.</p>

<p>Like you, I&#39;m also hyper focused on suspect accounts. There was one time where I noticed a thread in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> where every single comment was made by accounts that were created that day and within hours of each other. They were all liberal comments and I tried to call stuff like that out, but it&#39;s hard to do without violating the rules. So I would just point out account age, but I did eventually get banned for harrasing users. Apparently pointing out account age is harrasing now adays. I tried to find the thread, but I can&#39;t find it. But, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and similar subs are rife with shills. There&#39;s one user there who solely just posts shareblue links every single fucking day. It pisses me off because propaganda shit like that should be banned, but whatever. </p>

<p>... not proof...evidence. There is a difference. </p>

<p>What takes the place of evidence?</p>

<p>I mean...really. How do you function without some kind of evidence?</p>

<p>Even when you think you&#39;re just going by gut instinct, your gut instinct comes from past experience - evidence.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why you would look at this one and automatically think someone was a shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t automatically think they were a shill. If they were being repeatedly unreasonable I&#39;d think they were a cunt.</p>

<p>If they were being dismissive I&#39;d also think they were a cunt. Whatever. </p>

<p>The real thing I&#39;d look at is their history. To see if they are on a mission. Directly disputing everything. Being poison to this sub. They are here. And they are on 4chan. If you think people aren&#39;t trying to push a narrative and being paid for it that&#39;s just naive.</p>

<p>Focus on the last thing I said. If you think you&#39;re arguing with somebody like this try to bring up 911 or Sandy Hook. If they don&#39;t agree with at least 911.  They need to get the hell out of the sub. But hey I&#39;ve only been here for half a year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do they? And you don&#39;t agree with what I&#39;ve got to say? Your account has been here a long time. Maybe you should look through my history before being dismissive, though I don&#39;t think youre shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Outlandish yes. Obviously that&#39;s for the individual to decide though. At the same time though these are conspiracy &quot;theories&quot; people are just theorizing. The burden of proof isn&#39;t exactly Fair all the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That point in OP&#39;s post is what allows many people here to dismiss people as &quot;shills.&quot; They think asking for proof, or dismissing their source material from &quot;paulsconspiracyblog.com&quot; is shill behavior. Oftentimes users, like me, are dismissed as a shill because I like my conspiracies the have a little bit of evidence behind them, not just my imagination. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a fucking conspiracy forum. Clearly there isn&#39;t always going to be proof of every claim. That doesn&#39;t mean the claims are untrue, just that they aren&#39;t <em>proven</em>, something pretty common in the conspiracy world. I don&#39;t know why this concept is so fucking difficult for people to understand, its so simple.</p>
