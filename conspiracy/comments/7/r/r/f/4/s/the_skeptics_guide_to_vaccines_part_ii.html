    <div class="md"><h2>Strain Replacement &amp; Pathogen Evolution</h2>

<p>Ideally, vaccines would provide perfect protection that lasts forever. However, vaccines are imperfect; they confer incomplete immunity.</p>

<p>Mounting evidence indicates that vaccines designed to <em>reduce</em> the growth rate of pathogens within their hosts produce conditions that actually <em>increase</em> pathogen virulence, ultimately preventing eradication of the disease.</p>

<p>Disease-causing organisms strive to maximally infect their hosts without killing them. Vaccines induce the targeted pathogen to adapt and evolve in unintended ways, creating undesirable disease outcomes in individuals and entire host populations.</p>

<p>Herd immunity may never be achieved as vaccination rates impel the pathogen family to avoid extinction by enhancing its hostile nature as it <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11742400">adapts to its new environment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This evolution can erode any population-wide benefits such that overall mortality rates are unaffected, or even increase, with the level of vaccination coverage.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16817536">We find</a> that the use of either anti-growth or anti-transmission vaccines leads to the evolution of pathogens with an increased within-host growth rate; infection of unvaccinated hosts with such evolved pathogens results in high host mortality.</p>

<p>The emergence and spread of mutant pathogens that evade the effects of prophylactic interventions, including vaccines, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23455568">threatens our ability to control infectious diseases globally</a>.</p>

<p>Vaccines that reduce pathogen replication <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18773536">may select for more virulent pathogens</a>, eroding the benefits of vaccination and putting the unvaccinated at greater risk.</p>

<p>The control of some childhood diseases <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25878365">has proven to be difficult even in countries that maintain high vaccination coverage</a>. This may be due to the use of imperfect vaccines and there has been much discussion on the different modes by which vaccines might fail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15221031">Immunity has been shown to promote virulence</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Vaccination] accelerated the rate of virulence evolution, rendering parasites more dangerous to naïve hosts. These results argue for further consideration of the evolutionary consequences for pathogen virulence of vaccination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vaccines that target some <em>but not all</em> strains of a disease can induce the emergence of other strains that become <em>more</em> prominent as they replace previous ones. </p>

<p>Often, the new strains are more virulent and may infect age groups normally unaffected by the disease.</p>

<p><strong>Haemophilus influenzae</strong></p>

<p>A vaccine targeting the “b” strain of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae">Haemophilus influenzae</a> was recommended for infants in 1991. Mass vaccinations against Hib increased deadly infections caused by the “a” strain and other non-b strains. </p>

<p>Adults and the elderly have also become more susceptible to invasive <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> disease <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10982068">following Hib vaccinations of children</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the introduction of Hib immunization in children, invasive Hib infections in unimmunized adults also declined, <em>but the overall rate of invasive Hi disease in adults increased.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23735653">deadly infections from <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type “a” have increased</a>, turning it into a “major invasive bacterial disease.”</p>

<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12508153">the incidence of Hia meningitis increased 8-fold</a> within one year after a vaccination program against Hib was initiated.</p>

<p>Several of the new strains are severe. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21054663">More than one-third of Hif cases and one-fifth of the non-typeable cases require intensive care</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The clinical burden of invasive non-type “b” <em>H. influenzae</em> disease, measured as days of hospitalization/100,000 individuals at risk and year, increased significantly throughout the study period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vaccination against Hib <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20398617">has altered the epidemiology of invasive <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> infections</a>. Prior to infant vaccination against Hib, 65% of all <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> cases were caused by the “b” strain. Now, 84% of all cases are now caused by the “f” strain and other non-b strains.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of the Hib vaccine, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17304452">there have been more fatal cases of non-Hib infections in the elderly</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The epidemiological characteristics of invasive <em>H. influenzae</em> disease have changed from a disease that predominantly affects children and is dominated by type b to a disease that predominantly affects adults and is dominated by non-typeable strains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21888789">The increased cases of virulent non-b <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> among adults</a> could be caused by the loss of cross-immunity that was provided by natural exposure to Hib or from changes in the organisms.</p>

<p>Invasive non-b strains of <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> are more virulent, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24421786">causing severe disease in the pediatric population</a>. These non-typeable strains <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21134777">are resistant to antibiotics</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Pneumococcal disease</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"><em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em></a> pathogen has more than 90 different strains. In 2000, a vaccine that targeted 7 of these strains was recommended for infants. In 2010, a new vaccine was introduced that targeted 13 pneumococcal strains.</p>

<p>Pneumococcal disease rates initially declined following the vaccine&#39;s release, but then increased when non-vaccine strains quickly replaced strains targeted by the vaccine. Many of these new strains are highly virulent and resistant to antibiotics. </p>

<p>Pneumococcal vaccination of children also significantly increased the risk of the disease in adults. Vaccine-induced pneumococcal strains are now a worldwide problem, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23676265">posing a threat to the long-term effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination.</a></p>

<p>Cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22338325">have increased significantly</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gains in disease reduction were offset by increases in replacement serotypes, particularly among the over-65 age group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20109042">Although the vaccine was effective against some strains</a>, “the emergence of replacement nonvaccine pneumococcal serotypes has resulted in an increase in the incidence of serious and invasive infections.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The increase in carriage of non-vaccine serotypes, and the consequent increase in invasive disease, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20377886">could reduce, negate or outweigh the benefit</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22814362">Adults are especially at risk</a> of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine-induced replacement serotypes, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20626365">infants have been affected as well</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19564254">There is evidence</a> that antibiotic-resistant strains of invasive pneumococcal disease have arisen from recombinations of vaccine and non-vaccine strains.</p>

<p>Due to strain replacement, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582389">the overall pneumococcal rate hasn&#39;t changed</a>. Also, the new vaccine that targets 13 strains <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24567842">“did not affect the rate of overall pneumococcal colonization.”</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) that are currently in use only protect against some serotypes of the bacterium, and there is now strong evidence that those serotypes not included in the vaccine <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24132203/">increase in prevalence among most vaccinated populations</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just two years after PCV13 was introduced, 94% of all pneumococcal strains in healthy children <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463806">were non-vaccine targeted serotypes</a>. PCV13 is expected to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22763632">induce strain replacement</a> like that seen with PCV7.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24089337">Strain replacement is inevitable</a> when vaccines only target some of the many strains that are in competition with each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>Selling Varicella</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox">Chickenpox</a> is a contagious disease caused by infection with varicella zoster virus. </p>

<p>Before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_vaccine">chickenpox vaccine</a> was introduced in 1995, it was common for doctors to recommend exposing children to the disease because it is generally benign in childhood and complication rates increase when it is contracted by teenagers or adults.</p>

<p>When people regain their health after contracting chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in the body. Later, when immunity weakens, the virus can become active again and cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingles">shingles</a>, also known as herpes zoster. </p>

<p>Immunity against shingles is strengthened by periodic exposures to the varicella virus. Before the chickenpox vaccine, frequent encounters with the varicella virus boosted antibody protection against shingles. Although chickenpox cases decreased after the introduction of the vaccine, this restricted opportunities to reinforce immunity and increased the rate of shingles. </p>

<p>Medical costs, pain, and suffering associated with shingles generally are much greater than with chickenpox. To address this problem, the maker of the chickenpox vaccine, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_%26_Co.">Merck &amp; Co.</a> has developed and released a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoster_vaccine">shingles vaccine</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to causing a dramatic rise in shingles, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22659447/">the vaccine becomes less effective as rates increase</a>. This is due to a reduction in opportunities for natural boosts to immunity which occur from exposure to people who are shedding the wild varicella virus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the prelicensure era, 95% of adults experienced natural chickenpox (usually as children)--these cases were usually benign and resulted in long-term immunity. Varicella vaccination is less effective than the natural immunity that existed in prevaccine communities. </p>

<p>Universal varicella vaccination has not proven to be cost-effective as increased herpes zoster morbidity has disproportionately offset cost savings associated with reductions in varicella disease. Universal varicella vaccination has failed to provide long-term protection from varicella zoster virus disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sponsored and promoted studies that showed positive outcomes of varicella vaccination but opposed, and attempted to block, publication of findings that were critical of the vaccination program.</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>Measles Mania</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles">Measles</a> is a contagious disease caused by a virus that affects the respiratory system, skin and eyes. </p>

<p>Complications from the disease are unlikely, and previously healthy children usually recover without incident. However, measles can be dangerous in populations newly exposed to the virus and in malnourished children living in undeveloped countries.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles_vaccine">A measles vaccine</a> was introduced in the 1960&#39;s, and it was combined with vaccines for mumps and rubella in a single MMR shot. </p>

<p>People who are vaccinated against measles can still get the disease, and measles <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585562/">can be transmitted from a fully vaccinated person to other fully vaccinated individuals</a>.</p>

<p>Measles vaccine failures cause outbreaks of the disease, raising <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23264672/">“important questions concerning the relative contributions of vaccine failure versus failure to vaccinate.”</a></p>

<p>Loss of immunity after receiving the MMR vaccine, combined with viral shedding, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1509566/">may spread disease and prevent herd immunity</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If wild virus can be spread via individuals with subclinical infections, it is doubtful whether population immunity (herd immunity), which is necessary to eliminate the three diseases, can be attained in large populations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fevers induced by measles vaccination are related to the replication and shedding of the live vaccine virus, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11858860/">“showing that subcutaneous injection of an attenuated measles strain can result in respiratory excretion of this virus.”</a></p>

<p>Only molecular genotyping can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11858860/">distinguish between wild-type and vaccine-related disease</a>.</p>

<p>Emergency room visits are significantly more common in children <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22174753">who recently received the MMR vaccine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are significantly elevated risks of primarily emergency room visits approximately one to two weeks following 12 and 18 month vaccination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Young children have an increased risk of requiring emergency care after MMR. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440113/">This is especially true for girls</a>, who “may have an increased reactogenicity to the MMR vaccine.”</p>

<p>Vaccine-related deaths have been associated with mumps as well, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770235">as a study has observed</a> &quot;devastating neurological complications associated with the detection of live-attenuated mumps virus in the brain of a child.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A toddler who developed severe neurological symptoms including blindness associated with chronic encephalitis and died following MMR vaccination <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/vaccine-did-it-mutated-mmr-mumps-virus-brain-child-caused-his-death-british-resea">was found to have vaccine-derived mumps virus in his brain</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contracting diseases like measles and mumps naturally in childhood may have lifelong health benefits, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26122188">a significant protection against heart attacks and strokes during adulthood</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Measles and mumps, especially in case of both infections, were associated with lower risks of mortality from cardiovascular disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The results of this study may be explained by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis">hygiene hypothesis</a>, which proposes that infections suffered during childhood are necessary for normal development of the immune system.</p>

<p>Many autistic children have elevated levels of antibodies to the measles virus but not to other viruses.  “An inappropriate antibody response to MMR, specifically the measles component thereof, <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/65007">might be related to pathogenesis of autism.</a>” As a result, a large number of autism cases may stem from neurological symptoms due to an atypical measles virus infections following MMR vaccination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>I just want to say that you should switch your statement and say that you want NEW research to create a NEW vaccines for these diseases that are LESS HARMFUL.</strong> It is a better statement than saying thay vaccines are bad and you shouldnt take them. Yes current vaccines on rare occasions cause devastating health effects. The next logical conclusion would be to fund NEW research into making SAFE vaccines.  While still getting vaccinated.</p>

<p>A couple of things I want to adress. Your post has made be angry, at your stupidity to suggest that we shouldnt vaccinate against measels. Just no...no. <strong>However you have a point in that they can have harmful and devastating side effects. Which autism is NOT one of them.</strong> Please read my section on that. I think you need to reapproach in that you pro vaccine but for a newer safer one. Anyways...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/smbbs/measles-elimination-orig">Here is greate slideshow on the actual complications of measels</a>. This statement itself is ignorant, and shows you only researched on why it is bad not what measels actually is, and how dangerous it is. It also proves your biase nature, towards anti-vaccine. Your statement that those who contract it rarely suffer complications unless they live in a 3rd world country is false.
[Here are some more of the complication and systems.](<a href="http://www.healthwatchcenter.in/">www.healthwatchcenter.in/</a>)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Do you think that combining 3 viruses in on, contributes to  some complications and ineffectiveness? If so wouldn&#39;t  the most logical conclusion would be to advocate for measels, mumps, and rubella to have their own seperate vaccine, which would be safer.</p>

<p>People who are vaccinated against measles can still get the disease, and measles <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585562/">can be transmitted from a fully vaccinated person to other fully vaccinated individuals</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, they can. But just cause some people do get measels when vaccinated it doesnt mean we still shouldn&#39;t.  Someo people get sun burnt after putting on sunscreen, that doesnt mean we shouldn&#39;t wear it, or make it anyless beneficial for our health.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Measles vaccine failures cause outbreaks of the disease, raising <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23264672/">“important questions concerning the relative contributions of vaccine failure versus failure to vaccinate.”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again. I think this should be used as evidence that their should be newer ones, using modern technology  and medicine. Not evidence used against not vaccinating.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Loss of immunity after receiving the MMR vaccine, combined with viral shedding, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1509566/">may spread disease and prevent herd immunity</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If wild virus can be spread via individuals with subclinical infections, it is doubtful whether population immunity (herd immunity), which is necessary to eliminate the three diseases, can be attained in large populations.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The key word being MAY. Enough said. My house may be hit by lighting during a thunder storm, that doesnt mean my house stops me from being protected by the rain and lighting. </p>

<p>I think it can be attain in larger populations if each vaccine for measels, mumps, and rubella are seperate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fevers induced by measles vaccination are related to the replication and shedding of the live vaccine virus, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11858860/">“showing that subcutaneous injection of an attenuated measles strain can result in respiratory excretion of this virus.”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, fever means your body is fighting of an infection. This is how vaccines are supposed to work. The live vaccine virus is their so that your body can build anti bodies to fight it. So when it actually invades your immune system will know how to fight it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only molecular genotyping can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11858860/">distinguish between wild-type and vaccine-related disease</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, how does this have any relevance?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Emergency room visits are significantly more common in children <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22174753">who recently received the MMR vaccine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are significantly elevated risks of primarily emergency room visits approximately one to two weeks following 12 and 18 month vaccination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Young children have an increased risk of requiring emergency care after MMR. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440113/">This is especially true for girls</a>, who “may have an increased reactogenicity to the MMR vaccine.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alright. This is evidence that we need to make a newer vaccine. We now know these things, and input them into the equation and take them into account. Do you think that if this wasnt 3 in 1 deal that this statistic would change?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vaccine-related deaths have been associated with mumps as well, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770235">as a study has observed</a> &quot;devastating neurological complications associated with the detection of live-attenuated mumps virus in the brain of a child.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A toddler who developed severe neurological symptoms including blindness associated with chronic encephalitis and died following MMR vaccination <a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/vaccine-did-it-mutated-mmr-mumps-virus-brain-child-caused-his-death-british-resea">was found to have vaccine-derived mumps virus in his brain</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This is rare, and it sucks. This should be evidence for new and improved vaccine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contracting diseases like measles and mumps naturally in childhood may have lifelong health benefits, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26122188">a significant protection against heart attacks and strokes during adulthood</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Measles and mumps, especially in case of both infections, were associated with lower risks of mortality from cardiovascular disease.
The results of this study may be explained by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis">hygiene hypothesis</a>, which proposes that infections suffered during childhood are necessary for normal development of the immune system.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement the whole potential health benefits thing is idiotic, ignorant, and lack of empathy for children. Just because you will be immune from it the rest of your life that does MAKE IT A GOOD THING! Why should a child needlessly suffer [horrific pain, rashes, and potentially dying](<a href="http://www.healthwatchcenter.in/">www.healthwatchcenter.in/</a>), when all that pain could be avoided with single shot, and still get life long immunity...sometimes. It is better to take the risk right now, until we get a better vaccine then to not take it and risk that child suffering. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many autistic children have elevated levels of antibodies to the measles virus but not to other viruses.  “An inappropriate antibody response to MMR, specifically the measles component thereof, <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/65007">might be related to pathogenesis of autism.</a>” As a result, a large number of autism cases may stem from neurological symptoms due to an atypical measles virus infections following MMR vaccination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please for the love of god get rid of your autism argument. Vaccines do not cause autism. End of discussion. </p>

<p>Clearly you do not understand what autism is. It is a group of complex <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Fact-Sheet#3082_5">NeuroDevelopmental disorder</a> characterized by repetitive and characteristic patterns of behavior and difficulties with social communication and interaction.
Autism is cause when the brain is developing in the womb. It lierally happens before you are fucking born.
Sorry to get all worked up about this, but I actually have high functioning autism. Yes I got vaccinate, and what a fucking mircle I dont have polio. And no it didnt make me autistic. This annoys me to no end. </p>

<p>I am so fucking tired from writing this, I will respond to the rest tomorrow. Hope this helps.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Despite so much being spent on health care in the first world, we are getting sicker and sicker, and Big Pharma keep refusing to study their vaccines, that&#39;s because they know what they&#39;re vaccines are really doing, if they believed their vaccines were good they would have no shame in studying them and showing us exactly how much harm they are causing.  Unfortunately vaccines are regularly causing all sorts of highly profitable problems, this is great for the industry, as healthy people don&#39;t make them profits.  Vaccines are causing Asthma, Diabetes Type 1, MS, Peanut Allergies, Epilepsy, Childhood Leukemia, Eczema, Muscle Wasting Diseases and so much more.  The childhood viruses were are vaccinating against are very mild and short term, nothing to worry about in healthy well-nourished individuals, the immune system knows what it&#39;s doing.  Whereas the problems the vaccines cause, nobody wants those, they are a life sentence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just found this, will put it here, the MMR vaccine is causing lots of epilepsy, which easily outweighs any theoretical benefit of the vaccine given that Measles is such a mild virus in the first world.</p>

<p>Physicians for Informed Consent Finds MMR Vaccine Causes Seizures in 5,700 U.S. Children Annually</p>

<p><a href="https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/news/physicians-informed-consent-finds-mmr-vaccine-causes-seizures-5700-u-s-children-annually/">https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/news/physicians-informed-consent-finds-mmr-vaccine-causes-seizures-5700-u-s-children-annually/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Los Angeles, Calif. — The California-based nonprofit organization, Physicians for Informed Consent (PIC), recently reported in The BMJ that every year about 5,700 U.S. children suffer seizures from the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.</p>

<p>This finding is derived from results of the most statistically powered safety study ever to measure the association between MMR vaccination and febrile seizures. More than half a million children were evaluated, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, from a Danish population that is relied upon globally to examine vaccine safety. The results showed that seizures from the MMR vaccine occur in about 1 in 640 children up to two weeks following MMR vaccination. Applying this risk of seizures to the 3.64 million U.S. children vaccinated with a first dose of MMR every year results in about 5,700 annual MMR-vaccine seizures.</p>

<p>“To make accurate and ethical public health decisions, the risks of a vaccine must be compared to the risks of the disease one is trying to prevent,” said Dr. Shira Miller, PIC president and founder. “When considering the MMR vaccine to prevent measles, the risks of the MMR vaccine need to be compared to the risks of measles.”</p>

<p>There is a five-fold higher risk of seizures from the MMR vaccine than seizures from measles, and a significant portion of MMR-vaccine seizures cause permanent harm. For example, 5% of febrile seizures result in epilepsy, a chronic brain disorder that leads to recurring seizures. Annually, about 300 MMR-vaccine seizures (5% of 5,700) will lead to epilepsy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), designed to be a warning system for identifying vaccine side effects, receives only about 90 annual reports of MMR-vaccine seizures following the first dose—only 1.6% of the 5,700 MMR-vaccine seizures that actually occur. Thus, other serious vaccine adverse events from MMR, including permanent neurological harm and death, may similarly be underreported.</p>

<p>“In the United States, measles is generally a benign, short-term viral infection; 99.99% of measles cases fully recover,” said Dr. Miller. “As it has not been proven that the MMR vaccine is safer than measles, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that mandatory measles mass vaccination results in a net public health benefit in the United States.”</p>

<p>Physicians for Informed Consent is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational organization dedicated to safeguarding informed consent in vaccination. To learn more about vaccine risks vs. disease risks, read PIC’s Letter to the Editor in The BMJ, and PIC’s Measles Disease Information Statement (DIS) and Vaccine Risk Statement (VRS) at physiciansforinformedconsent.org/measles.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection">Human papillomavirus</a> is a sexually-transmitted virus with more than 100 subtypes. Although most infections cause no symptoms and resolute spontaneously, in some cases they can result in precancerous lesions.</p>

<p>In 2006, the FDA approved a new HPV vaccine for 9 to 26-year-old women. The vaccine protects against 4 of the 100 strains of HPV. Another HPV vaccine, produced by a U.K. manufacturer, is also available in many parts of the world.</p>

<p>Young teenage girls have no risk of dying from cervical cancer, but they gamble with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25535199">permanently disabling autoimmune or degenerative disorders</a>, or death, following their HPV vaccines:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The present study provides epidemiological evidence supporting a significant relationship between HPV4 vaccine administration and serious autoimmune adverse events.</p>

<p>For example, women diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, a serious autoimmune disease, were 5 times more likely that controls to have received the HPV vaccine (odds ratio, OR=5.3).</p>

<p>Women diagnosed with alopecia (OR=8.3), gastroenteritis (OR=4.6), vasculitis (OR=4.0), and central nervous system conditions (OR=1.8) were also significantly more likely than controls to have received the HPV vaccine.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Some girls <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26425627">develop premature ovarian insufficiency after HPV vaccination</a>, which may affect childbearing. Current HPV vaccine safety research is inadequate to determine ovarian safety.</p>

<p>Coercive tactics such as vaccine mandates that are supported solely by vaccine manufactures&#39; own data is unacceptable. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22420796">The HPV vaccine manufacturer aggressively lobbied legislators</a> to mandate their vaccine for school entry, drafted the legislation, provided the science, and made financial contributions to lawmakers.</p>

<p>There is no significant evidence showing that HPV vaccination can prevent cervical cancer, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22188159/">and the long-term benefits are based on assumptions, not reliable research data</a>:</p>

<p>Current worldwide HPV immunization practices appear to be neither justified by long-term health benefits nor economically viable, nor is there any evidence that HPV vaccination (even if proven effective against cervical cancer) would reduce the rate of cervical cancer beyond what Pap screening has already achieved.</p>

<p>Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities). </p>

<p>We thus conclude that further reduction of cervical cancers might be best achieved by optimizing cervical screening (which carries no such risks) and targeting other factors of the disease rather than by the reliance on vaccines with questionable efficacy and safety profiles.</p>

<p>Wrong. Simply wrong.</p>

<p>There are more than 100 types of HPV and only 40 are considered sexually transmitted. Of those 40, 13 are commensal meaning that they cause no harm.</p>

<p>That leaves 27 types of sexually transmitted HPV that can potentially cause harm. 13 of those canc cause warts. <strong>14 can cause cancer. Of these 14, HPV 16 and HPV 18 cause more HPV related cancers than all the other HPV types put together including about 70% of all cervical cancers.</strong></p>

<p>Although most infections cause no symptoms and resolve spontaneously, that simple statement is misleading without definitions. After all, &quot;most&quot; of 100 cases could be 51.</p>

<p>It is now estimated that around 90% of sexually active people in the US have had or will have at least one HPV infection with most of those having more than one.</p>

<p>Men tend to have more infections and those infections tend to last longer while women suffer more adverse reactions, more specifically, women suffer adverse reactions of HPV infections 8 or 9 times more often than do men. That is almost exclusively due to the uterine cervix susceptibility to precancerous and cancerous lesions.</p>

<p>Is HPV a sexually transmitted disease? SOME types are sexually transmitted. </p>

<p>Does it make a difference if there are &quot;over 100&quot; types of HPV? YES! If you&#39;re implying that a vaccine is useless because it only covers 4 types, it makes a huge difference. Only 2 types of HPV cause 70% of cervical cancers and about 90% of all other HPV related cancers.</p>

<p>4/100 or more=.04, 2/2.5=80% Would you like to have 4% coverage or 80% coverage?</p>

21% of cervical cancers were diagnosed in women 20-29 years of age.
1% were diagnosed in their teens.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s in a country where Paps are given beginning at the age of 21.</p>

<p>In the UK where the universal health care coverage starts Pap smears at 25 instead of 21, MOST cervical cancers are diagnosed in women younger than 29.

<p>It takes 7 to 10 years, average (depending what type of cervical cancer), to develop invasive cervical cancer from an HPV infection. If you&#39;re sexually active at 13, you can have cervical cancer at 20 before you&#39;ve ever had a single Pap.</p>

I don&#39;t deny they exist necessarily, I just want to know more.

<p>When one learns that lots of the common allergies and autoimmune diseases are vaccine injuries, then you ask about when the friend/family member first had symptoms, you&#39;ll find it&#39;s mostly just after a vaccine or not long after.</p>

<p>A pensioner I knew was going away through a cruise, he got two travel vaccines before he went, both at the same time.  He told the doctor it wasn&#39;t a good idea to give them together, but the doctor said it was fine.  On the cruise he got extremely sick, almost died, he was later diagnosed with an autoimmune disease associated with one of the vaccines he received.  It costs 2K US dollars per month for a treatment to keep him alive, even still he&#39;s already been close to death on a few times, such is the severity of his illness.</p>

<p>For example Chicken Pox is perfectly safe in a healthy individual, unless they take Ibuprofen or Aspirin, then it becomes a problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most people who get chicken pox are fine, the mortality rate is typically low. In the US, before the vaccine came out there were ~4 million cases, ~9000 hospitalizations, and ~100 deaths per year. About 1/5 of those hospitalized developed neurological complications.</p>

<p>The vaccine causes serious complication in 2.6/100,000 doses, and death in .1/100,000 doses (usually in children with severe congenital defects or a compromised immune system, who shouldn&#39;t have received it in the first place). Usually about 5 million doses are given per year - that adds up to 100 cases of serious side effects and 5 deaths per year.</p>

<p>Chicken pox was a comparatively benign illness, but it still caused deaths and serious problems. The vaccine has brought down levels of infection by close to 90%, and it&#39;s risks are far less than the virus.</p>

<p>Vaccines cause you to shed the virus for 2 weeks. Ok, that sounds pretty bad. How many people have caught chickenpox from an immunized person? 11. So it&#39;s obviously not the same as the virus floating around the population in it&#39;s normal manner. Yeah, definitely &quot;tears apart&quot; the herd immunity &quot;marketing approach&quot; as you call it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s WRONG, more smoke and mirrors from you, the key line you missed out above the data you gave us is </p>

<p>&quot;Among women younger than 40 years of age—&quot;</p>

<p><strong>So of those who are under 40</strong>, &quot;21% of cervical cancers were diagnosed in women 20-29 years of age. 1% were diagnosed in their teens.&quot;</p>

<p>Cervical cancer accounts for less than 1% of all new cancer diagnosis, it&#39;s mostly a problem for smokers and those who used oral contraception.  Healthy females will clear up the HPV virus naturally.   The HPV vaccine has approx 1 in 33 risk of harming you, that is far higher than the risk of cervical cancer itself, especially in someone so young who is at low risk.  It&#39;s also been admitted in official documents that if you had HPV when you received the vaccine your risk of cervical cancer increases, yet they are not screening to see if people have HPV before giving the vaccine.  Another thing to watch out for is that many <a href="http://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/10/28/false-positive-cervical-smears">cervical cancer diagnosis are false positive</a>, they show up in official data as the real thing and tens of thousands of $ are spent treating a healthy individual, that means the healthy patient being damaged by the chemo along with $100,000+ for Big Pharma.</p>

<p>&quot;The present study provides epidemiological evidence supporting a significant relationship between HPV4 vaccine administration and serious autoimmune adverse events.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is from the abstract of this study:
A case-control study of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine-associated autoimmune adverse events. December, 2014</p>

<p>Here is the recommendation at the end of the study abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additional studies should be conducted to further evaluate the potential biological mechanisms involved in HPV4 vaccine-associated SAAEs in animal model systems, and to examine the potential epidemiological relationship between HPV4 vaccine-associated SAAEs in other databases and populations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good advice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conclusion
Exposure to HPV vaccines was not associated with an increased risk of ADs within the time period studied. Results were robust to case definitions and time windows of exposure. Continued active surveillance is needed to confirm this finding for individual ADs.</p>

<p>Is it biased? </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean it was biased but maybe we can find another study.</p>

<p>8) Wiley site down but this is the same study published elsewhere:
 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27478093">Incidence of new-onset autoimmune disease in girls and women with pre-existing autoimmune disease after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination: a cohort study.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>RESULTS:
A total of 70 265 girls and women had at least one of the 49 predefined autoimmune diseases; 16% of these individuals received at least one dose of qHPV vaccine. In unvaccinated girls and women, 5428 new-onset autoimmune diseases were observed during 245 807 person-years at a rate of 22.1 (95% CI 21.5-22.7) new events per 1000 person-years. In vaccinated girls and women, there were 124 new events during 7848 person-years at a rate of 15.8 (95% CI 13.2-18.8) per 1000 person-years. There was no increase in the incidence of new-onset autoimmune disease associated with qHPV vaccination during the risk period; on the contrary, we found a slightly reduced risk (incidence rate ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.93).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, that&#39;s only an abstract and I can&#39;t tell you who funded the research.</p>

<p>So here we are with at least two studies that have done exactly what OPs study suggested - followed up on a potential connection. And they found none.</p>

<p>Not one single study performed. All of these are articles and opinion.</p>

<p>Cervical cancer is caused by a persistent infection by a high risk type of HPV. Cervical cancer begins as dysplasia and progresses through several stages of dysplasia through to cancer. Therefore, evidence that people who have been vaccinated have fewer incidence of dysplasia is also evidence that there will fewer incidence of invasive cancer.</p>

<p>This guy is trying to say that reducing incidence of dysplasia is not evidence the vaccine works. That&#39;s quackery.</p>

<p>You attacked your opponent&#39;s character or personal traits in an attempt to undermine their argument.</p>

<p>You started your submission claiming that you were not guilty of &quot;gish gallop&quot;</p>

<p>However, I spent significant effort demonstrating that on just one narrow sampling of your arguments they were fraught with inaccuracy and poor quality. The very definition of gish gallop.</p>

<p>Instead of supporting the quality or accuracy of those arguments, you used ad hominem as a response.</p>

<p>Do you find this to be productive?</p>

<p>Even one of the lead researchers in developing this vaccine is speaking out about it, and the very real problems with this vaccine have become evident enough that even mainstream news sites can&#39;t ignore it anymore. So please, stop pushing your agenda here. </p>

<p>&quot;Parents and women must know that deaths occurred. Not all deaths that have been reported were represented in Dr. Slade&#39;s work, one-third of the death reports were unavailable to the CDC, leaving the parents of the deceased teenagers in despair that the CDC is ignoring the very rare but real occurrences that need not have happened if parents were given information stating that there are real, but small risks of death surrounding the administration of Gardasil.&quot;</p>

<p>She also worries that Merck&#39;s aggressive marketing of the vaccine may have given women a false sense of security. &quot;The future expectations women hold because they have received free doses of Gardasil purchased by philanthropic foundations, by public health agencies or covered by insurance is the true threat to cervical cancer in the future. Should women stop Pap screening after vaccination, the cervical cancer rate will actually increase per year. Should women believe this is preventive for all cancers - something never stated, but often inferred by many in the population-- a reduction in all health care will compound our current health crisis. Should Gardasil not be effective for more than 15 years, the most costly public health experiment in cancer control will have failed miserably.&quot;</p>

<p>To give a bit of data, I looked through the first six pages of your most recent comments (25 posts a page so 150 in total). I count 9 that aren&#39;t HPV related. That&#39;s less than 5%. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m really baffled how you can sincerely deny that your posts are overwhelmingly on a single topic. </p>

<p>I mean, I can see why you&#39;re so into the subject. Your ex husband sounds like a real piece of shit who really screwed you over. So I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re a shill. But come on now, surely you can admit you&#39;re super interested in talking about HPV on reddit.</p>

Physicians for Informed Consent Finds MMR Vaccine Causes Seizures in 5,700 U.S. Children Annually</p>

<p><a href="https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/news/physicians-informed-consent-finds-mmr-vaccine-causes-seizures-5700-u-s-children-annually/">https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/news/physicians-informed-consent-finds-mmr-vaccine-causes-seizures-5700-u-s-children-annually/</a></p>

<p>Los Angeles, Calif. — The California-based nonprofit organization, Physicians for Informed Consent (PIC), recently reported in The BMJ that every year about 5,700 U.S. children suffer seizures from the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.</p>

<p>This finding is derived from results of the most statistically powered safety study ever to measure the association between MMR vaccination and febrile seizures. More than half a million children were evaluated, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, from a Danish population that is relied upon globally to examine vaccine safety. The results showed that seizures from the MMR vaccine occur in about 1 in 640 children up to two weeks following MMR vaccination. Applying this risk of seizures to the 3.64 million U.S. children vaccinated with a first dose of MMR every year results in about 5,700 annual MMR-vaccine seizures.</p>

<p>“To make accurate and ethical public health decisions, the risks of a vaccine must be compared to the risks of the disease one is trying to prevent,” said Dr. Shira Miller, PIC president and founder. “When considering the MMR vaccine to prevent measles, the risks of the MMR vaccine need to be compared to the risks of measles.”</p>

<p>There is a five-fold higher risk of seizures from the MMR vaccine than seizures from measles, and a significant portion of MMR-vaccine seizures cause permanent harm. For example, 5% of febrile seizures result in epilepsy, a chronic brain disorder that leads to recurring seizures. Annually, about 300 MMR-vaccine seizures (5% of 5,700) will lead to epilepsy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), designed to be a warning system for identifying vaccine side effects, receives only about 90 annual reports of MMR-vaccine seizures following the first dose—only 1.6% of the 5,700 MMR-vaccine seizures that actually occur. Thus, other serious vaccine adverse events from MMR, including permanent neurological harm and death, may similarly be underreported.</p>

<p>“In the United States, measles is generally a benign, short-term viral infection; 99.99% of measles cases fully recover,” said Dr. Miller. “As it has not been proven that the MMR vaccine is safer than measles, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that mandatory measles mass vaccination results in a net public health benefit in the United States.”</p>

<p>Physicians for Informed Consent is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational organization dedicated to safeguarding informed consent in vaccination. To learn more about vaccine risks vs. disease risks, read PIC’s Letter to the Editor in The BMJ, and PIC’s Measles Disease Information Statement (DIS) and Vaccine Risk Statement (VRS) at physiciansforinformedconsent.org/measles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here’s a fun tidbit. At 17 I was diagnosed with HPV. My gyro told me it rarely goes away on its own and the only way to fix it was getting the gardisil vaccine. She used her authority to lie to me, she said it would make my HPV go away. </p>

<p>I asked around and read a few articles before deciding to simply live a healthier life and avoid the vaccine. My HPV cleared up by next pap and ten years later I’m still hpv free.</p>

<p>Moral of the story. Doctors lie to you. They offer a <em>false sense of security</em> and that’s the biggest problem with vaccines, being offered a vaccine as a cure all when you likely just need to change your lifestyle </p>

    <div class="md"><h2>Pushing Pertussis</h2>

<p>The first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis_vaccine">pertussis vaccine</a> was introduced in the 1930&#39;s to treat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis">whooping cough</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The recent resurgence in pertussis infections is put down to a combination of waning immunity and new mutations in the pathogen that existing vaccines are unable to effectively control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pertussis vaccine has encouraged evolutionary adaptation, permitting virulent vaccine-resistant strains of pertussis to emerge.</p>

<p>People who are vaccinated against pertussis may be silent carriers of the disease and capable of infecting others. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24277828">baboons vaccinated against pertussis became carriers and spread the disease</a>.</p>

<p>Because people who are vaccinated against pertussis can still spread the disease, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26103968/">herd immunity and eradication are virtually unattainable</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Asymptomatic transmission is the most parsimonious explanation for many of the observations surrounding the resurgence of <em>B. pertussis</em> in the US and UK. These results have important implications for <em>B. pertussis</em> vaccination policy and present a complicated scenario for achieving herd immunity and <em>B. pertussis</em> eradication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23478868/">Fully-vaccinated children are still susceptible to pertussis</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pertussis has increased in the U.S. since the 1980s despite high coverage with pertussis childhood vaccines. Protection from the DtaP series beings to wane after vaccination, contributing to the accumulation of vaccinated individuals who are still susceptible to disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since protection after vaccination wanes within 2 to 4 years, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25941309/">“lack of long-term protection after vaccination is contributing to increases in pertussis</a> among adolescents.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24757216">New strains of pertussis toxins have emerged</a> subsequent to pertussis vaccination:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Global transmission of new strains is very rapid and the worldwide population of <em>B. pertussis</em> is evolving in response to vaccine introduction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The vaccine <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19751581">is not effective against these virulent new strains</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vaccines designed to reduce pathogen growth rate and/or toxicity may result in the evolution of pathogens with higher levels of virulence...waning immunity and pathogen adaptation have contributed to the resurgence of pertussis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since Pertussis has “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22841154">no non-human hosts or environmental niche</a>, vaccine-mediated immunity is the most likely selective pressure against <em>Bordetella pertussis</em>.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Significant changes in <em>B. pertussis</em> populations have been observed <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23406868">after the introduction of vaccinations</a>, suggesting a role for pathogen adaptation in the persistence and resurgence of pertussis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pertussis vaccine failures are due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22529282">genetic changes in pertussis strains and poor efficacy</a>, not because too many people are unvaccinated.</p>

<p>When the acellular pertussis vaccine (DtaP) replaced the whole cell pertussis vaccines (DTP) in the 1990s, the World Health Organization created an official standard method to define cases of pertussis.</p>

<p>The new definition was excessively restrictive, requiring laboratory confirmation and at least 21 days of paroxysmal cough. As a result, legitimate cases of pertussis were eliminated and the efficacy of the vaccine was artificially inflated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003418">The universal use of pertussis vaccines has been associated with genetic changes</a> in circulating <em>B. pertussis</em> strains...with DTaP vaccines, genetic change should be a major concern regarding vaccine efficacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Acellular pertussis vaccines are designed to protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertactin">pertactin</a>, however, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22348138">pertactin-negative mutations have emerged in Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22717007/">France</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22914363">Finland</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655754">Australia</a> and the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23388024/">United States</a>.</p>

<p>DtaP vaccination to protect children from <em>B. pertussis</em> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21034823">increases their risk of whooping cough</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordetella_parapertussis"><em>B. parapertussis</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22156857"><em>B. parapertussis</em> infections contribute significantly to the overall pertussis burden</a> and contribute to the pool of children thought to have vaccine failure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20200027">Another study concluded that</a> &quot;aP vaccination interferes with the optimal clearance of <em>B. parapertussis</em> and enhances the performance of this pathogen,&quot; resulting in &quot;an approximately 40-fold increase in <em>B. parapertussis</em> lung colony-forming units.&quot;</p>

<p>Pertussis vaccines also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23092514">do not protect against whooping cough</a> caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordetella_holmesii"><em>B. holmesii</em></a>.</p>

<p>The imperfect immunity given by pertussis vaccines is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16048777">causing outbreaks of whooping cough in highly vaccinated populations</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that populations of <em>B. pertussis</em> may have evolved to circumvent the immune responses elicited by vaccination and to alter their virulence levels raises a number of questions concerning the design and use of future vaccines.</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>Influencing Influenza</h2>

<p>Originally developed in the 1940s, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine">influenza vaccine</a> is strongly encouraged for nearly everyone over the age of 6 months. About 170 million doses were expected to be produced for the U.S. market during the 2015/2016 flu season, compared to 32 million in 1990.</p>

<p>Annual vaccination against seasonal influenza reduces protective immunity against more virulent strains. People who are naturally exposed to circulating influenza viruses (the unvaccinated) frequently gain cross-protection against other strains of the disease. </p>

<p><em>Vaccinated people are denied this benefit</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879807">Preventing infection with seasonal influenza viruses by vaccination</a> might prevent the induction of heterosubtypic immunity to pandemic strains, which might be a disadvantage to immunologically naive people--eg, infants.</p>

<p>Prior receipt of 2008-09 TIV trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20386731">was associated with increased risk of medically attended pH1N1 illness</a> during the spring-summer 2009.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19440239">These findings</a> may have implications for the general recommendation to vaccinate all healthy children against seasonal influenza.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22643217/">Annual vaccination may hamper</a> the development of cross-reactive immunity against influenza A viruses of novel subtypes, that would otherwise be induced by natural infection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The CDC policy of vaccinating pregnant women is not supported by science. Pregnant women vaccinated against seasonal influenza and A-H1N1 swine flu <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23023030">had high rates of spontaneous abortions</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ACIP&#39;s recommendation of influenza vaccination during pregnancy <a href="http://www.jpands.org/vol11no2/ayoub.pdf">is not supported by citations in its own policy paper</a> (pdf) or in current medical literature. Considering the potential risks of maternal and fetal mercury exposure, the administration of thimerosal during pregnancy is both unjustified and unwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The current season&#39;s influenza vaccine will not work in people <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23413420">who also received the previous season&#39;s vaccine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In vaccinated subjects with no evidence of prior season vaccination, significant protection (62%) against community-acquired influenza was demonstrated. Substantially lower effectiveness was noted among subjects who were vaccinated in both the current and prior season. There was no evidence that vaccination prevented household transmission once influenza was introduced; adults were at particular risk despite vaccination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The influenza vaccine is not very effective, causes adverse reactions, and can spread disease to other people. <a href="http://www.jpands.org/vol11no3/geier.pdf">This study</a> (pdf) analyzed 18 years of data and concluded that the influenza vaccine has little or no effectiveness for preventing influenza cases, hospital admissions, or deaths.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22895945">Another study determined</a> that “the manufacturers&#39; refusal to release all safety outcome data from trials carried out in young children, together with obvious reporting bias and inconsistencies in the primary studies does not bode well for a fair assessment of the safety of live attenuated vaccines.”</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15733718/">an assessment</a> of the efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines in healthy children, there was “no convincing evidence that vaccines can reduce mortality, admissions, serious complications, and community transmission of influenza.”</p>

<p>Children who receive an inactivated influenza vaccine are significantly more likely than non-vaccinated children <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22525386/">to be hospitalized</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We found a threefold increased risk of hospitalization in subjects who did get trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Children vaccinated against seasonal influenza are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22423139">more likely to develop respiratory virus infections</a>.</p>

<p>Handwashing and teaching proper hygiene <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19773323">may be more effective than vaccines</a> at reducing the spread of influenza and other respiratory viruses:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The disparity in effectiveness between the high profile of influenza vaccines and antivirals and the low profile of physical interventions is striking. Public health recommendations are almost completely based on the use of vaccines and antivirals despite a lack of strong evidence.</p>

<p>We could not correlate increasing vaccination coverage after 1980 with declining mortality rates in any age group...<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15710788">we conclude that observational studies substantially overestimate vaccination benefit</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19840664">There is no unbiased scientific evidence</a> that influenza vaccines improve death rates in the elderly.</p>

<p>Vaccinating healthcare workers against influenza to protect their elderly patients <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16631547">is not effective</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vaccinating healthcare workers who care for those aged 60 or over in long-term institutions showed no effect on laboratory-proven influenza or complications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mandatory vaccination for healthcare workers to protect their patients <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23209901">is not supported by science</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The studies aiming to prove the widespread belief that healthcare worker vaccination decreases patient morbidity and mortality are heavily flawed and the recommendations for vaccination biased.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Influenza vaccine studies and their conclusions <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19213766">rarely match the actual data that is in those studies</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of our studies (70%) were of poor quality with overoptimistic conclusions—that is, not supported by the data presented. Those sponsored by industry had greater visibility as they were more likely to be published by high impact factor journals and were likely to be given higher prominence by the international scientific and lay media.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23553143/">There is no good evidence that vaccines reduce serious complications of influenza</a>. Moreover, promotional messages conflate &quot;influenza&quot; (disease caused by influenza viruses) with &quot;flu&quot; (a syndrome with many causes, of which influenza viruses appear to be a minor contributor). </p>

<p>This lack of precision causes physicians and potential vaccine recipients to have unrealistic assumptions about the vaccine&#39;s potential benefit, and impedes dissemination of the evidence on nonpharmaceutical interventions against respiratory diseases. In addition, there are potential vaccine-related harms, as unexpected and serious adverse effects of influenza vaccines have occurred.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f3037">Closer examination of influenza vaccine policies</a> shows that although proponents employ the rhetoric of science, the studies underlying the policy are often of low quality, and do not substantiate officials’ claims. The vaccine might be less beneficial and less safe than has been claimed, and the threat of influenza appears overstated.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>US data on influenza deaths are a mess. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges a difference between flu death and flu associated death yet uses the terms interchangeably. </p>

<p>Additionally, there are significant statistical incompatibilities between official estimates and national vital statistics data. Compounding these problems is a marketing of fear—a CDC communications strategy in which medical experts “predict dire outcomes” during flu seasons.</p>

<p>This guy suggestions that getting fucking measels in early childhood and letting your body deal with it naturally that way is actually and more healthy and beneficial just because it worked for <em>some people</em>.

<p>Fortunately now we&#39;re at a stage where the experts are now able to crowdfund to the necessary research which the pharmaceuticals refuse to do.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right that&#39;s exacting what some studies suggest...not only that but contracting measles <em>naturally</em> in childhood is associated with lower rates of heart disease in later life.</p>

<p>The vaccine made polio epidemics <em>worse</em>...and when they realized this they changed the definition of polio to make it seem like cases had been <em>reduced</em> by the vaccine.</p>

<p>DDT poisoning and high-sugar diets contributed to the &quot;polio&quot; epidemic, and the vaccine was contaminated with SV-40, a cancer-causing simian virus.</p>

<p>An entire generation was therefore given a cancer-causing virus, which may be directly responsible for today&#39;s epidemic in soft-tissue cancers.</p>

<p>So yeah, the polio vaccine was one of the greatest scientific debacles of the 20th century.</p>

<p>I love that you sticky and mod your own thread and then call out other subs as &quot;safe spaces&quot;. I also love the shotgun technique of link posting. 100 links, 5 minutes to read each, 15 to fact check with multiple sources, 5 to summarize and respond. Round it up to 50 hours to address each claim made. Not counting the additional links, sprinkled here and there, that would also have to be verified. Only really useful to someone who thinks your claims are credible, because who is going to bother with that? Well played indeed. You literally can&#39;t argue against it. Again, well done. And stickied as well? Have a well deserved upvote. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disaster seems like a bit of a stretch, seeing as nobody has polio anymore. Again, id draw attention to the lack of people with polio. No, im not going to go through and fact check 50 other false claims. Your main claims seem to be that live polio vaccine gives people polio-it definitly can, thats why they are switching to the inactive vaccine to finally eliminate it. Live vaccine is cheap and easy to administer. Seems to have worked pretty well, considering polio is just about eliminated.</p>

<p>Your other point seems to be that meningitis is actually polio. It&#39;s just not. Transmission is different, symptoms are different, disease process is different, patient outcomes are different. And we can actually see stuff under microscopes, meaning that this conspiracy extends to everyone with a microscope.  But why let that stand in the way. Im sure you have another link avalanche to &quot;prove&quot; your point. </p>

<p>I used to care if people immunized their kids. I care less now. You do you. More personal freedom, i say. You want to ride a motorcycle on the interstate with your kid on the back with no helmet, why is that my business? I mean, i&#39;ll make fun of you, because i think your behaviour is reckless and ill considered. But im sure as hell not going to stop you. The problem with most vaccines is they dont last as long as we thought. A blood titer and a booster every once and a while fix the problem of unvaccinated people adequately. Your risk taking behavior is fully none of my concern. </p>

<p>Tell that to the 10s of thousands of cases of &quot;non-acute flaccid paralysis&quot; that the polio vaccine recently caused in India.</p>

<p>In the 1950&#39;s, this polio vaccine-caused paralysis would have been classified as, you guessed it, polio!</p>

<p>When the vaccine was <em>clearly</em> making things worse, they reclassified polio to require a much narrower definition, effectively &quot;eliminating&quot; polio, when in reality paralysis cases were called something else.</p>

<p>Again, read the section on polio in my first Skeptic&#39;s Guide...it&#39;s been scientifically determined that elimination of the polio virus is <em>impossible</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is an important distinction between 1 in 100 000 (your claim) and a bit more than 1 in 4 (everybody else). What im saying is, and i think you just demonstrated this really well, your initial claim was a totally made up number and the actual number is really easy to find. My question was where did you come up with that number? Did you just make it up, or did you read it and not check it? </p>

<p>Good example of how virtually every claim here will fall apart under any kind of scrutiny, though. Cheers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats not what you said. You said 1 in 100k show symptoms of the disease. No mention of rate, and if thats what you actually meant its really poorly worded. 
I&#39;ll play though. Rate over how much time? Annually? Lifetime? Its not a rate if you dont include a time, its just a bullshit number you made up.</p>

<p>And your number is bullshit anyway. 1949 there were 42000 cases in the us, pop 149 000 000. 1 in 3500 got sick that year. Thing is, its localized, so spreading it out really minimizes the risk. In 1916, 2000 people died from polio in new york city alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All diseases are cell-damage that we give specific names to. But the term &quot;disease&quot; is a strange one. It doesn&#39;t make much sense to refer to symptoms of cell-damage as a fragmented term.</p>

<p>So basically you look at what causes cell-damage. The answer lies in chemistry: acidosis and alkalosis. Your body needs both, but too much acidosis and your lymph system, kidneys, adrenals, pituitary glands and liver start to fail. Your body gets too acidic and can&#39;t get rid of the toxins? Cell damage. </p>

<p>We give these varying degrees of cell damage names like diabetes and cancer. But we never look at what root cause of the problems are. </p>

<p>The answer is really, really simple. Just get rid of what causes the acidosis. That way you allow the 100 trillion cells in your body to resume what they do best: pooping and eating. Without flooding the interstitial cells with acids, your body actually functions properly and gets rid of damage. </p>

<p>You can even revert genetic weaknesses with life-style changes. Babies were never supposed to be born with tumors, toddlers were never supposed to wear glasses. Something&#39;s up here.</p>

<p>The concept I&#39;m playing with is that we are a tropical species. As such, we were never supposed to eat dead animals, nor drink their milk. Sure, you can survive off it. Depending on how strong your constitution and current health, you can do quite well. But once you&#39;re sick, you have to detox. Get rid of the toxins in interstitial cells so your 100 trillions bone-cells, muscle-cells and brain-cells can resume functioning optimally. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all acidosis, alkalosis and how this relates to the health of your lymph system. This is essentially the sewage system of your body. That&#39;s how you get rid of acids and toxins. Kidneys too. For a lot of people, these systems are quite clogged up. Get too clogged up? Get stuff like depression. Body can&#39;t get rid of heavy metals? Get Alzheimer&#39;s. Can&#39;t get rid of systemic inflammation / acidosis? Get arthrititis. Makes sense to me.</p>

<p>Everything else in the universe is cause and effect. If you wake up to find your car keyed, you don&#39;t say: &quot;Oh well, that&#39;s probably because the car was getting older. Old cars often have scratches.&quot; No, you say: who&#39;s the fucker that keyed my car? Except when it comes to illness, you are the fucker who keyed your own body. But people in general are not ready for this level of self-accountability, people love pills that drown out the symptoms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of illnesses can be avoided by healthy living, I agree. But you have people that live a clean life and still get cancer, Or kids that get some stupid illness and it kills them.  </p>

<p>You have people in countries that reject vaccines because they think the UN are trying to poison them but when was the last time you knew of someone dying of rubella or measles? Or all those people suffering from polio?  </p>

<p>If you live in a country that has a for-profit healthcare system you will be wary of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read a lot of stuff on polio. Is it true? I don&#39;t know. But... my two cents is that this explanation is plausible: polio is caused by highly unsanitational circumstances and malnutrition.</p>

<p>This is all post world war 2, so it makes sense. We also saw polio dissappear in other countries where they didn&#39;t have the vaccins. Yet all they did was change nutrition and sanitation circumstances. So how do you explain that?</p>

<p>Again, no proof. But organisations like the UN, the WHO, the CDC and the FDA give me the absolute creeps. I&#39;ve heard them openly say they prefer the world&#39;s population to go into the 500 millions, not the 7 billions. So... Yeah, take it with a grain of salt, but I&#39;ve seen some weird claims come from these organisations.</p>

<p>And I live in a country with a for-profit healthcare system and it severly fucked me up thankyouverymuch :-)</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t know which people lead a 100% clean life and get cancer. Can you name these people? I&#39;m not trying to be a dick per se, but almost everyone I know thinks they live healthily. But they don&#39;t, not by my current standards.</p>

<p>Also kids getting ilnesses is horrific. But I can definitely see a cause-and-effect relationship being plausible. Children get their lymph system from their mothers. Genetic weaknesses being hereditary sounds plausible to me.</p>

<p>Also vaccins often contain thimerosol and other heavy metals. We already know that amalgam in teeth can cause psychosis, schizofrenia and levels of depression and madness previously thought infathomable. And we&#39;ve know this stuff since the mad hatters... </p>

<p>Heck, even as close as 40 years ago, doctors told pregnant women they could smoke up to 10 cigarettes a day. You could say my &quot;trust&quot; in allopathic medicine, when it comes to chronic ilnesses, has essentially become zero.</p>

<p>Again, not evidence, but I&#39;ve put hundreds of hours of personal research into health. Most of what I&#39;ve come to accept as true is based on evidence and logic. Or at least on results. </p>

<p>Not a cancer?. Not saying a lifestyle change won’t “reduce” risk of many cancer. Sun exposure, drinking, smoking, pollution and hereditary conditions etc all have an affect.</p>

<p>Just over 4 in 10 can be preventable by lifestyle change</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not saying leukemia won&#39;t kill you, nor that it isn&#39;t a nasty thing. I&#39;m saying the label of &quot;cancer&quot; is not accurate.</p>

<p>I got my information on illnesses, like cancer, from hundreds of hours of my own research. Some reading papers, mostly hundreds of hours of lectures from Naturopaths who have a track record of keeping their patients alive.</p>

<p>So, look. It worked for you. That&#39;s good, great. Glad to have you alive. But there is absolutely zero chance you&#39;ll ever see me trust an MD over a highly qualified and reliable ND (though there are only a handful of those in the entire world). Because I have some life experience when it comes to health myself. You may think this knowledge was airdropped to me. You have no idea and I don&#39;t want to go deep into that with highly skeptical individuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got my information from having had cancer and spending the next 3 and a half years reading studies, papers, watching 100’s of hours of lectures and debates and a huge amount of reading up on not just my form of cancer but many others. Social media, someone watching a few videos and reads a few articles and they think they know better than professionals that dedicate their lives to it. I certainly don’t but from your comments you actually know less than me. Not sceptical, but a lucky and educated enough survivor. I rely on professionals and specialists in the field for my information </p>

<p>I’d rather you provide written links over YouTube videos please. Feel free to go as deep as you want</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, what this entire conversation will boil down to is this: allopaths try to control the body, naturopaths try to give the body what it needs to heal itself. So if you&#39;re not someone who believes in the &quot;God-force&quot;, free markets, free will, and that there are people out there who are, for lack of a better term, &quot;evil&quot;, I just don&#39;t see the point in continueing this conversation. Because your mind needs to truly understand that &quot;trust&quot; in others will get you fucked and killed.</p>

<p>If Robert Morse, Peter Glidden and Joel Wallach (all on YouTube) can&#39;t provide enough proof through clinically verified, physics and chemistry based proofs, my personal argumentation doesn&#39;t stand a snowball&#39;s chance in hell. </p>

<p>The td;dr of all disease and cancer is: you cause cell damage to yourself through acidosis / inflammation. Because you&#39;re a tropical species that should only eat fruit. Yet you eat bread, rice, dead animals, heat your meals in radiation chambers (microwave ovens), sit in front of acid forming computer screens, treat your cancer with acid chemotherapy (acids on acids...). So basically your entire life is a lie. All of it. Your entire belief system, everything you believe. It&#39;s all bullshit. So yeah, from my experience, maybe 3% of all people have the ability to accept this. Because it means leaving your culture behind. That means never talking to your &quot;friends&quot; again, cutting off ties with family.</p>

<p>How the fuck does anyone do that? They can&#39;t. You need money to survive. So you also need the ability to get money that isn&#39;t dirty. Which is impossible. Except through Bitcoin. </p>

<p>So yeah, you can think I know less than you. But you&#39;re only using your thinking mind. That limits you. It&#39;s useful only for immediate survival, not for big-picture reasoning and understanding.</p>

<p>The next time you speak to your oncologist, ask him these ten questions. They&#39;re all quite reasonable. I can almost guarantee he will kick you out of his office: <a href="https://youtu.be/UnwojBg-vIY?t=53">https://youtu.be/UnwojBg-vIY?t=53</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look mate I already stated there were external factors that can increase the risk in some cancers and the percentage of cancers that can be reduced/prevented (I provided the links). I have been clear for 3 years so no I am not looking at it from someone in stage 4/5 and taking stuff at face value because my life is dependent on it. I am going by all available evidence available from professionals and researchers in that field (including a sister that was a long term oncology nurse) that I have been studying since getting the all clear. The simple fact is there is still a huge amount we don’t know yet (yet you do?) also some cancers can not be treated through chemo/radio. There’s over 200 cancers all with loads of varying degrees taking into account the stage/persons makeup/cancer with millions of variables.</p>

<p>Mutations can happen by chance when a cell is dividing. They can also be caused by the processes of life inside the cell. Or by things coming from outside the body, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke. And some people can inherit faults in particular genes that make them more likely to develop a cancer.</p>

<p>Some genes get damaged every day and cells are very good at repairing them. But over time, the damage may build up. And once cells start growing too fast, they are more likely to pick up further mutations and less likely to be able to repair the damaged genes.</p>

<p>Notice the word  “Chance”?</p>

<p>Face facts mate sometimes it’s just bad luck in some cases. “Not” all. </p>

<p>Please elaborate on this “only using your thinking mind comment”. You completely lost me there. Throw something nonsensical in there and beat me down with some stupid?.... Am I to believe someone on a conspiracy forum that watches the odd YouTube video and reads a little bit on the tinterweb or someone that save lives or dedicates their life’s work to understanding the disease?. </p>

<p>Actually don’t bother because we’ll just run round in circles. Have a nice day and enjoy arguing with yourself ;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get it, only Pharmaceutical patented products can possibly be good for us and only Pharma paid off doctors can ever know the truth about true health.  Healthy diet is useless, not smoking is useless, vitamins useless, exercise a waste of time, only vaccines can save us.  We all need to listen to Big Pharma Vaccine Millionaire Paul &#39;Profit&#39; Offit on why it is safe to receive 10,000 vaccines on one sitting.</p>

<p>Following your logic we should all go and ask McDonald&#39;s for advice about a healthy diet.</p>

<p>Which ones? Let&#39;s discuss that! I&#39;ve been working on this post off and on for about a year. Any studies that have been &quot;discredited or retracted&quot; have happened since then...can you link the ones you&#39;re referring to so I can update my post?</p>

<p>I use that for my OC...it helps to have a place to work/edit larger posts with tons of links first before I share it in its completed form on a larger sub like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>In this instance, the wording was poor, and I apologize. I&#39;ve changed it to reflect the fact that the study determined that the flu vaccine was efficacious, but that more studies are urgently needed before making the vaccination of children a public health policy.</p>

<p>&quot;Thimerosal is a mercur y-containing compound that
prevents the growth of dangerous bacteria and
fungus. It is used as a preservative for flu vaccines
in multi-dose vials, to keep the vaccine free from
contamination. Thimerosal is also used during the

the growth of microbes. &quot;</p>

<p>The researchers emphasize, however, that the risks associated with low-level exposures to inorganic mercury in the developing brain are unknown, and they describe other research linking persistent inorganic mercury exposure with increased activation of microglia in the brain, an effect recently reported in children with autism. They recommend further research focused specifically on the biotransformation of thimerosal and its neurotoxic potential.</p>

<p>Stating the purpose of Mercury in the vaccine, i.e. as preservative, does not in anyway prove it is safe.  And just because Big Pharma don&#39;t do research to see if Mercury, Aluminum etc are safe, and so hence don&#39;t find any bad evidence through not looking, still does not mean that injecting Mercury and Aluminum is safe.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t get to the why, but I will watch it. What time in the video does he explain this? </p>

<p>Regardless though, his point is that thimerosal is toxic, and since this was made, it has been removed from almost all vaccines. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>First, you can ask for the flu shot without thimerosal, which is available. Second, since thimerosal isn&#39;t in vaccines like MMR, hep-b, and all other recommended childhood vaccines, what&#39;s the theory then? What&#39;s the problem with those vaccines, which do in fact immunize children? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Realisticly most people are not going to request a thimerosal free version of the flu vaccine. Most people just get their shot as given because &quot;doctor knows best&quot;</p>

<p>Yes i recommend watching the video to the end. It&#39;s long and slightly dated but this guy goes way down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>At 30 min he begins to talk about the conflict of interest between regulators and industry, and financial ties between them. </p>

<p>Shortly after that he begins to explore intent. By 45 min deeper.... Rockefeller, Kissinger, Gates, World Health Organization....</p>

<p>At the one hour point he really dives down the rabbit hole even more. I&#39;ll let you decide. Make some popcorn to go with the red pill. It&#39;s a video worth watching imo </p>

<p>But it still doesn&#39;t answer my question about MMR, hep, chickenpox, etc.  They no longer contain thimerosal , so what is the current theory on them?  Why would they be bad, considering that they do vaccinate children against potentially deadly diseases.</p>

<p>Your script is well out of date, we&#39;re already at a stage where a CDC whistleblower has confirmed that the studies showing vaccines caused autism were destroyed as part of one of the biggest cover-ups.  The former head of the NIH said that the necessary studies to see if vaccines cause autism have not yet been performed, she says the studies are required.  Even vaccine millionaire patent holder Paul &#39;Profit&#39; Offit admitted to other vaccine shills (on video) that it is not know with MMR causes autism, but he recommended they lie about it.</p>

<p>Also we are not discussing the whole Autistic spectrum, just the part of it linked with vaccines, not Asperger etc, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_dgh4UJ9L4">just when children regress after their vaccines into something far more serious than Aspergers</a> after a vaccine, and even worse than Down Syndrome.</p>

<p>Of the pregnant women who took Thalidomide, not everyone one of their babies had birth defects, a % of them do.  There are many factors at play, but since they refuse to do the necessary research we will never know exactly which factors are involved when a child goes Autistic after a vaccine.  Known factors including a number of different vaccines, Tylenol (University of California found it was those who were given Tylenol at the time of MMR who were most likely to go Autistic) and mitochondrial disorders as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh-nkD5LSIg">admitted by the CDC</a>.  Instead of doing the necessary science to find out who needs to avoid the MMR, they&#39;ve gone into full whitewashing cover-up mode, lying and destroying evidence, clearly the CDC do not deserve trust, especially not with the advice they dispense about your your child&#39;s health.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Then the Autism rate shouldn&#39;t be rising so fast.  The fact that it&#39;s been scientifically proven that children who receive late vaccines are less likely to go Autistic should give the game away.</p>

<p>One needs to be cautious, there is a lot of pharmaceutical propaganda going around, be careful with what you read in the mainstream media.  Do the research for yourself, there is no substitute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you should always be wary of who is funding and carrying out these kinds of studies. Including studies by anti-vax foundations. What&#39;s more helpful is checking the impact of journals they are posted to to see if they are reputable and not predatory or have one of the main scientists on their board. Checking their expertise is important too (like ophthalmologists doing vaccine research).</p>

<p>The best thing about scientific studies though is that you can go and look at them yourself and they get peer-reviewed.

<p>You mean vaccine safety advocates, who are the ones instead of trying to market a product with fake studies, actually try to find out if vaccines are safe.  No these are the most important studies of all, the non-BS ones.</p>

<p>You should be warning us about the pro-vax studies which aren&#39;t using real placebos in safety studies and are removing people from studies if they get sick.  You&#39;ve got the whole reality upside down.</p>

<p>The so-called anti-vax side are people who have given up lucrative careers to get the truth out, the industry destroys people as soon as they dare find out the harm of a vaccine.  The money is in the pro-vaxx side, so that&#39;s why it&#39;s full of shills and weak characters, whereas the vaccine safety side is full of decent human beings trying to get the truth out, save lives and protect health.</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS: There is no increased risk of postvaccination seizure in infants regardless of timing of vaccination. In year 2, delaying MMR vaccine past 15 months of age results in a higher risk of seizures. The strength of the association is doubled with MMRV vaccine. These findings suggest that on-time vaccination is as safe with regard to seizures as delayed vaccination in the first year of life, and that delayed vaccination in the second year of life is associated with more postvaccination seizures than on-time vaccination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That has literally nothing to do with the comment you are addressing. Autism itself has absolutely nothing to do with seizures, there needs to be comorbid epilepsy or some other similar independently seizure causing condition in order for them to occur.</p>

<p>&quot;Aluminum (Al) is highly neurotoxic and has been
shown to impair both prenatal and postnatal brain
development in humans and experimental animals.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The risks from current childhood vaccination
schedules are thus twofold. First, a single vaccine
may disrupt the delicate balance of immune mediators
required for normal brain development
and thus compromise neurodevelopmental programs.
Second, such multiple vaccinations are
routinely administered simultaneously (Table 2),
thus magnifying the inflammatory response
which, although being essential for linking the
innate and adaptive immune responses, is also
responsible for adjuvant’s immunotoxic effects.4
The repetitive taxing of the immune system by
high doses of Al adjuvants may also cause a
state of immune hyperactivity, a known risk for
autoimmune diseases.&quot;</p>

<p>Most studies show a remarkably higher level of aluminum built up in the brain of those who suffer from autism and immunodeficieny disorders. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmkVv8pcVhc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmkVv8pcVhc</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not completely anti-vax but you can save your shit. There are risk vs. rewards when deciding the schedule for your child I have no reason to subscribe to the 72 vaccines they&#39;re currently recommending. My child is at zero fucking percent chance of contracting HepB so you can save your aluminum. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing selfish about it. I want to do what&#39;s best for my child.</p>

<p>What they do is they show linkages between actions and results with an according level of confidence in the hypothesis.</p>

<p>That why when you see polls, they have a disclaimer on them &quot;The results are accurate to +/- 3.2% 19 times out of 20. That is the accuracy of the number they are trying to estimate using their methods and sample size.</p>

<p>Autism has worse outcomes than Down Syndrome, most pregnant women would choose to abort if their unborn child had Downs Syndrome. Autism is a life sentence for the parents, it most cases they would have preferred their child to die from the vaccine than be left mentally retarded, screaming, banging their head against a wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, autism runs in my family: I have three cousins with the syndrome, ranging from high-funcitoning Asperger&#39;s to low-functioning ASD. And I guarantee you <em>none</em> of my aunts and uncles would rather their child be dead right now. </p>

<p>Yes, my cousins have trouble with things that you and I find easy, from emotional regulation to social interactions. But that doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t wonderful, valid human beings whose lives are just as worth living as yours and mine. One of them currently studying to be a computer programmer. Another lives in a group home, but he&#39;s the sweetest man you&#39;ll ever meet and lightens up all our family gatherings. I would cry my eyes out if anything happened to any of them. And you just wished death on them all.</p>

<p>Seriously, get out there and actually meet someone with autism (or Asperger&#39;s or ASD -- they&#39;re all different names for the same disorder). Look past the superficial differences, and you&#39;ll soon realize they&#39;re just people, who want to live fulfilling lives and be loved, same as anyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To say that autism &quot;runs in your family&quot; may be missing the bigger picture. </p>

<p>What if your genetics simply have weakness within in them. A weakness that only gets triggered when heavy metals are introduced into your genetic make-up. Perhaps certain glands within your lymph system are not as strong as with others. Perhaps your kidneys are genetically weaker.</p>

<p>Perhaps none of these weaknesses would have triggered autism or Asperger&#39;s had these people never received vaccines that contain formaldehyde, aluminium and other substances that have no place in the human body.</p>

<p>I have a cousin who is &quot;on the spectrum.&quot; His uncle is a structural engineer, our grand-father is a teacher. I don&#39;t have any issues myself. Yet the cousin, I assume, got a lot of vaccines as the uncle is a firm believer in modern medicine. </p>

<p>Of course we don&#39;t want people to go or die. But it is wise to essentially &quot;zoom out&quot; of your situation. Look at others and look at history. I am personally seeing many more people develop systems that simply were not around a few decades ago. So something is going on. And perhaps genetic constitution is a key factor.</p>

<p>At least all of this makes a lot of sense to me. I&#39;m a big fan of the wholistic approach of looking at the body and, when necessary, using wholistic methods of healing.</p>

<p>Big Pharma decide what&#39;s &#39;officially recognized&#39;, that&#39;s all about profits and cover-ups.  They have a history of renaming Polio when it was convenient, calling things Cancer which aren&#39;t Cancer and now we see they through a serious vaccine injury in with all of the rest of the Autism, despite it being distinctive from the other types.  This is how they hide it i.e &quot;well Autism was here already so nothing new&quot;, but it&#39;s regressive Autism and quite different from the other types.  Parents aren&#39;t making up stories, as the CDC whistleblower has admitted this is a cover up, he was there and witnessed the destruction of evidence.</p>

<p>your initial comment was regarding death as well. You said &quot;...die to easily preventable disease&quot;. So now are you agreeing that vaccines aren&#39;t the major factor when it comes to saving lives?</p>

<p>We were talking about biases and correlation doesn&#39;t always mean causation... My professor brought up autism and vaccines as an example. It wasn&#39;t like she picked a side, just mentioned it. </p>

<p>This student asks &quot;did it show if it was, like, uneducated people that believed this? Like autism?... Really, come on!&quot; and she did an annoying laugh like you have to be the dumbest to believe it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like she couldn&#39;t see why someone would believe it once but. She couldn&#39;t understand from someone else&#39;s point of view. I hate that people are getting like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP&#39;s post is full of incredibly intellectually dishonest misinformation. There are certainly many valid complaints to be made about the American health care system and pharmaceutical industry. But the basic functioning of vaccines is very well understood by modern science. The cherry-picked facts from these articles pale in comparison to the literally thousands of peer-reviewed studies demonstrating the overall safety of vaccines. Mild reactions to various vaccines are fairly common, but serious reactions are EXTREMELY rare, typically on the order of 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000. Meanwhile the effects of many of these diseases can be extremely serious if not fatal, especially in children who don&#39;t have developed immune systems like adults. It is incredibly irresponsible to not get your kids their basic vaccines.  </p>

<p>I absolutely believe in small groups of of wealthy elites and government insiders carrying out criminal conspiracies. But tens of thousands of scientists and doctors from all around the world are not in on a conspiracy to trick you into thinking you should get vaccinated.  </p>

<p>&quot;Despite the agency’s disclaimer, the CDC does receive millions of dollars in industry gifts and funding, both directly and indirectly, and several recent CDC actions and recommendations have raised questions about the science it cites, the clinical guidelines it promotes, and the money it is taking.&quot;</p>

<p>Marcia Angell, former editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, told The BMJ, “The CDC has enormous credibility among physicians, in no small part because the agency is generally thought to be free of industry bias.

<p>Amazing how they simply drop sick people from a safety trial to whitewash the results:-</p>

<p><a href="https://khn.org/news/desperate-quest-for-herpes-cure-launched-rogue-trial/">Southern Illinois University Herpes vaccine trials</a></p>

<p>From <a href="https://khn.org/news/desperate-quest-for-herpes-cure-launched-rogue-trial/">khn.org</a> link above</p>

<p><strong>Vaccine Trial Side Effect 1</strong></p>

<p>One, a web developer in his 20s, felt ill after receiving just one dose.</p>

<p>“I experienced tiredness and ringing in my ears,” said the web developer, who reported the feelings along with “disequilibrium and slurred speech” continue to this day.</p>

<p><strong>Vaccine Trial Side Effect 2</strong></p>

<p>Another participant, a Colorado woman in her 40s, said she told Halford she experienced flu-like aches and pains and tingling and numbness soon after the second shot. The symptoms were followed by an “excruciating” 30-day outbreak of herpes.</p>

<p>“I have new symptoms every day,” that woman later wrote Halford in an email exchange provided to KHN. “This is terrifying.”</p>

<p><strong>So what do the researchers do?  Remove them from the study to whitewash the whole thing, making the vaccine appear perfectly safe</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Halford had told participants he would follow up on their reactions to the vaccine for a year, according to the consent form. But he <strong>stopped sending questionnaires</strong> to the two participants who said they had been <strong>dropped from the trial.</strong>&quot;</p>

Me and my partner did talk about vaccinations and we both don’t just blindly trust the pharmaceutical community, but risking my child’s life in the off chance she may develop a syndrome as well as a possible harbinger of death for other kids seems extreme. Unvaccinated kids our all other kids at risk, and if something happened to my kids because of it, id probably gut the bastards. There is reason that even the most forward thinking pediatricians and child care services, and schools won’t take unvaccinated kids. While there may be side effects and chances of developmental issues, the consequences of forgoing these things are too risky. Have someone come up with a better solution, but until then don’t try to scare new parents into making poor decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As usual with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, it&#39;s asking good questions, but I&#39;m skeptical of the answers. Here&#39;s a quote from one of your linked posts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the introduction of Hib immunization in children, invasive Hib infections in unimmunized adults also declined, but the overall rate of invasive Hi disease in adults increased.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I checked the paper.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines, rates of Hib disease in Alaska&#39;s indigenous people were among the highest in the world. Vaccination reduced rates dramatically; however, invasive H. influenzae type a (Hia) disease has emerged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re stating that the introduction of the vaccine was unarguably beneficial for indigenous Alaskans, not the reverse.</p>

<p>Representation of infected, indigenous Hib patients from 1980-1982 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3484505">was representative of 51% of the total infected</a>. Alaskan natives are 16% of the population. Reduction of Hib was dramatic and effective. A study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16882783">cited by the paper you linked</a> says that &quot;After universal infant vaccination in 1991, H influenzae type b disease among Alaska Native and non-Native children &lt; 5 years of age decreased by 94% and 96%, respectively.&quot;  That&#39;s a major success.</p>

<p>The paper you link spans from 1983 to 2011. The Hib vaccines were introduced in 2002. Type-a emerged a decade later. It is of note that the Hib vaccine reduced the Hib infection rate, so the Hib vaccine was effective, regardless of a new strain showing up on the scene.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my issue here, and maybe you can help. Where in the study does it suggest that the Hib vaccine is a direct cause of the Hia upswing among Alaskans? And if the Hia upswing is a resultant of the Hib vaccine, did the vaccine&#39;s benefits outweigh the future challenges presented by type-a flu?</p>

<p><strong>Please explain.</strong></p>

<p>[Add: I&#39;m a layman, so if I tripped up on the medical details, please let me know, and I will correct.]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying the idea of vaccines is bad, I&#39;m saying they have taken this &quot;medical procedure&quot; and are turning it into a soft kill weapon. They work slowly at this global agenda. It&#39;s a multi generational plan. Their goal is to reduce the population drastically. You are all being programmed that it is normal to get huge numbers of vaccines. You are not to question it. Just get your jabs. No questions. Line up and vaccinate regularly. They are making it normal. </p>

<p>This will weaken immune systems by overloading them. This also diminishes natural immunity to the wild viruses. It&#39;s all preparation for a big viral pandemic that is coming. I also believe that they are going to use them as covert birth control. Sterility will be common someday. </p>

<p>Go ahead and vaccinate if you want to. Keep an eye on it though and remember what I told you. There will be more and more and more vaccines being forced at you. Maybe you don&#39;t need them all? Chicken pox is a good example. Do you really need that vaccine? </p>

<ol>
<li>Correlation is not causation, as the studies shows the more vaccines the worse the infant mortality.  The reduction of infant mortality is linked to improved nutrition and sanitation.</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol>
<li> It&#39;s not just the US, if you draw a graph showing which countries give the most vaccines, it&#39;s clear that the more a country gives the worse it&#39;s infant mortality.  This will be to do with vaccines causing SIDS and many autoimmune diseases and allergies.  Japan found that when they stopped vaccinating under 2&#39;s their infant mortality rate jumped up to best in the world, SIDS vanished in the country.  The unfortunate reality is that it is not safe to vaccinating children under the age of 2 as essential detoxifying enzymes are not yet present in the liver, so it any child under the age of 2 is being poisoned in one way or another with vaccines.</li>

<blockquote>

<p>You have been misled on that, pharma refuse the necessary studies, they play games with statistics and allow people with conflicts of interest to make key decisions.  The CDC has been captured by industry, so they are all part of the same beast.</p>

<p>Here we see <a href="https://patientdanmark.dk/private-forces-to-raise-funds-research-into-aluminium-in-vaccines/">experts having to crowdfund for their own vaccine safety research</a> because Big Pharma continue to refuse to perform the most basic studies of all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mild reactions to various vaccines are fairly common, but serious reactions are EXTREMELY rare, typically on the order of 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody knows that as the studies are never performed, vaccine-induced autoimmune diseases can take months to show symptoms after a vaccine.  No tracking system is in place to find out exactly how much carnage vaccines are causing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a start then</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But tens of thousands of scientists and doctors from all around the world are not in on a conspiracy to trick you into thinking you should get vaccinated. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not many of them are involved, they just get fed marketing information from the top and have to place trust in it.  The necessary safety studies are never performed so the bad data never reaches them.  It would be like asking a soldier in US Afghan if 9/11 was a false flag, they&#39;ve been told from their boss that it was and that hence Afghan needs to be attacked, they weren&#39;t there when the false flag too place, the same as most doctors are involved in testing vaccines and funding biased studies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not vaccinating your kids directly can have an impact on other people&#39;s kids and is a big reason that schools want you to have your vaccinations up to date before they start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have fallen hook line and sinker for the propaganda antiquegeek.  The recently vaccinated shed viruses for 2 weeks post-vaccination, yet we let them walk around shopping malls and in schools.  The unvaccinated don&#39;t spontaneously generate viruses out of nowhere to spread around.  Actually studies show that the unvaccinated are far healthier on average than the vaccinated.</p>

<p>I&#39;d strongly recommend you do some research before spreading your beliefs on social media, as they could endanger a child if anyone follows your advice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CDC have been asked to perform the study themselves but they refuse, they say it&#39;s &#39;unethical&#39;, which is an absurd excuse, they know the study will find out the truth, so instead they use studies where they play games with the data.  </p>

<p>Fortunately good scientists have already been analyzing the data available, this one found that vaccinated children to be over six times more likely to have neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD).</p>

<p><strong>Pilot comparative study on the health of vaccinated and unvaccinated 6- to 12-year-old U.S. children</strong> </p>

<p>&quot;However,  in  a  final  adjusted  model  with  interaction,  vaccination  but  not  preterm  birth  remained  associated  with  NDD,  while  the  interaction  of  preterm  birth and vaccination was associated with a 6.6-fold increased odds of NDD (95% CI: 2.8, 15.5). In conclusion, vaccinated homeschool children were found to have a higher rate of allergies and NDD than unvaccinated homeschool children. While vaccination remained significantly associated with NDD after controlling for other factors, preterm birth coupled with vaccination was associated with an apparent synergistic increase in the odds of NDD.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats the SOP because this test produces so many false negatives. They don&#39;t want to miss flu cases so they will diagnose flu then follow up  with a more accurate test. Because flu is dangerous. Skipped that part to cherry pick something out of context that &quot;supports&quot; your point, huh? How totally like the rest of this thread. 
Also, because you are pretending not to understand this, let me explain the basic pathology of flu. You get sick from flu, then you get pneumonia. It&#39;s like getting a cut, then you get an infection. Most of the time, the infection is what kills you. Sometimes it&#39;s just flu, like with spanish flu, but luckily that&#39;s not the case most of the time. 
What i&#39;d like to see is a citation for the original claim that flu virus by itself hardly kills anybody. I&#39;ve noticed you guys seem to like posting fake numbers, and I want to see a credible source for your original claim.</p>

Reported flu deaths are not reported because of a test they are reported because the doc makes a judgement call. This leads to errors in the reported numbers. There is no way to measure how many people die from the flu until they make regulations that require testing of suspected flu deaths that confirm it. Gold standard is biopsy or western blot to confirm the actual bacteria not the antibodies. </p>

Joking. Let&#39;s pretend for a second that somebody who dies from a flu like illness also tested positive for flu. Which is likely right? They would get a rapid test, or the RT-PCR, or a viral culture positive result for influenza. That person&#39;s condition worsens and they die. And you are saying the only way to know anything about how they died is a post mortem test? I mean, yeah, it would be nice to have that information, but at the same time I think we can be confident that they didn&#39;t die from a car crash. Are you suggesting a mystery agent? Or just that 99% certain isn&#39;t worth anything? I get that, but it&#39;s a really thin limb to suggest that these deaths aren&#39;t caused by flu.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is they don’t bother testing post Mortem. The diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation. Elderly patients can die fro many things because they have so many different diseases. You are just hell bent on being right. Maybe read your own link and learn a thing a two. There is no reason to jump to a mystery agent, when most elderly take about 7 different medications for about 5-7 different conditions. Blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiac, diabetes, gastric, and pain meds. Respiratory distress can occur for many other conditions besides the flu. Since testing is not needed for the flu and it is unreliable the doctor is making a guess. 
I would love evidence as well, but the lack of evidence is not evidence of proof. Without proper collection techniques the numbers are unreliable. That should concern everyone because we have no way to verify if the numbers reported are accurate and trust is an emotion that has no place in science more so in medical settings. 
FYI: mystery agent? You sound silly, and seem to resort to demeaning labels when your facts don’t support your argument. Tha shows a lack of curiosity and intelligence on your end. You seem more concerned with being right even when you are wrong, not very smart. No one is ever right all the time. In this case try some humility and if you are truly concerned about resolving the problem of the flu then you are going to need to follow facts and not some hidden agenda to push false narratives. Good luck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where does it say that most diagnoses are clinical? There you go again, making yet another false claim that has to be refuted instead of admitting you are posting outright lies. The document says you can diagnose flu clinically during an outbreak inspite of a negative rapid test result. It also says to then follow up with a more accurate test. This is because it is safer be cautious. </p>

<p>Im looking at my state&#39;s numbers right now. They are reporting not just the number of positive tests, but the strain of flu. Did they get that from a clinical diagnosis? The strain of flu? You are so completely full of shit its amazing. </p>

<p>You are claiming that people that die after getting a positive flu test didnt die from flu. We arent talking about clinically dignosed cases here. We are talking about people who get a positive test result for flu, and then die. You are saying they what, coincidentally died right after, because diseases are common and old people take a lot of medication? Lol, buddy. People get flu and they die, you cant explain that. That&#39;s the extent of your reasoning here. How embarrassing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, parent of an autistic six year old here. My son is the most honest, caring, and sweet boy I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing, let alone raise. Sure, it’s difficult to raise one child who is neurotypical and one who is not because each has their own unique challenges. </p>

<p>From my experience with my son going to therapy and meeting many children with autism, it is often the fear (from a combination of ignorance about autism and the anti-vax movement) that holds parents back from getting their child therapy when their brain is still developing out of denial that their child has it in the first place, causing children to be much lower functioning than they otherwise may have been.</p>

<p>Every child can miss their window of opportunity to learn to socialize and communicate. Children with autism simply learn their own unique ways and need to be given the right tools to succeed while they still can utilize them.</p>

<p>I’m not downplaying how difficult it can be to care for someone who refuses to communicate. Before he was diagnosed and he wasn’t yet in therapy, my husband and I were going through hell. However, since he was diagnosed when he had just turned three and we got him into ABA therapy right away, he went from having moderate autism to high functioning and may even test out of the spectrum entirely.</p>

<p>If you really want to help children with autism, stop scaring parents into thinking it’s some horrible disease worse than polio, smallpox, etc. All you’re doing is scaring good willed parents out of doing what is right for their kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Below is how the CDC justify artificially inflating their flu deaths, most of which are really pneumonia which is a very common cause of death in very sick people who were already on their way out.  They inflate the deaths to help sell the vaccine.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm</a></p>

<p>&quot;CDC does not know exactly how many people die from seasonal flu each year.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Why does CDC estimate deaths associated with seasonal flu?&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;CDC feels it is important to convey the full burden of seasonal flu to the public. Seasonal flu is a serious disease that causes illness, hospitalizations, and deaths every year in the United States. CDC estimates of annual influenza-associated deaths in the United States&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;What categories does CDC use to estimate flu-associated deaths?</p>

<p>CDC uses two categories of underlying cause of death information listed on death certificates: pneumonia and influenza (P&amp;I) causes and respiratory and circulatory (R&amp;C) causes. CDC uses statistical models with records from these two categories to make estimates of influenza-associated mortality.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Here <a href="http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/research/pi-trend-report.pdf">http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/research/pi-trend-report.pdf</a> we get to see exactly how many of the deaths were really caused by Influenza </p>

<p>e.g. In 1999 the pneumonia deaths were 62,065 and influenza just 1,665</p>

<p>e.g.2.  In 2010 the pneumonia deaths were 49,597 and influenza 274</p>

<p>The Tetanus vaccine is based on bad science and is one of the most dangerous on the market.  In Africa they found that it actually reduced the lifespan of children who were injected with it.</p>

<p>Tetanus is a disease of poor wound hygiene, normally one would only expect someone with serious burns or an immune system issue to go down with Tetanus, but even if they did there is are tetanus antitoxins, such as tetanus immune globulin and also antibiotics, so there is no benefit in risking the vaccine.</p>

<p>Eight children dead in a span of 2 and a half weeks from diphtheria, in 1897-98.</p>

<p>Vaccine was in use by the 1940&#39;s, and cases <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/dip.html#trends">fell dramatically</a>. From 18,000—20,000 in 1940 to 2,000 in 1960. Cases reported nowadays are a tiny, tiny percentage of what they were 100 years ago.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/diphtheria">Diphtheria is extremely rare in the United States today; between 2004 and 2011, no cases of diphtheria were reported to public health officials. One case was provisionally reported in 2012.</a></p>

<p>Vaccines, in concert with improved health and hygiene, are the reasons why a family in 1987, or 1997, or 2017 don&#39;t have to suffer the tragedy of losing <strong>8</strong> children because of an entirely preventable disease.</p>

<p><a href="http://vaccinepapers.org/wp-content/uploads/Autism-and-aluminum-adjuvants-in-vaccines.pdf">Why the autism connection needs to be further researched...</a></p>

<p>The term “immune activation”
describes the activation of the cellular
components of the immune system. The
developing brain can be injured by immune
activation, with life-long consequences
(Meyer 2009, Deverman 2009, Estes 2016,
Kneusel 2014, Careaga 2017, Meyer 2014).
Immune activation injury is linked to autism,
schizophrenia, depression and other mental
illnesses or neurodevelopmental disorders.
Immune activation effects on the brain are
mediated by immune system signaling
molecules, especially cytokines (Estes 2016,
Meyer 2014, Smith 2007, Choi 2016, Pineda
2013).
It is generally accepted that immune
activation (e.g., from infection) during
pregnancy is a risk factor for autism and
schizophrenia in the offspring (Ciaranello
1995, Atladottir 2010, Brown 2012). The
intensity and duration of immune activation
and cytokine expression appear to be
important factors influencing autism risk
(Meyer 2014). Intense immune activation is
associated with greater risk of autism
(Careaga 2017, Atladottir 2010). Chronic
inflammation is associated with greater risk
of autism (Jones 2016, Zerbo 2014). However,
there is no evidence that short-duration, low intensity
immune activation resulting from
common childhood illnesses increase autism
risk. Timing of immune activation in relation
to stages of brain development is also an
important factor (Meyer 2006, Meyer 2009).
Animal experiments have tested the
effects of immune activation during
pregnancy and postnatally on the
development of offspring (Meyer 2009,
Deverman 2009, Estes 2016, Kneusel 2014,
Careaga 2017, Meyer 2014). In these
experiments, pregnant animals (mice, rats
and monkeys) or neonates are injected with a
non-infectious immune activating substance
such as “poly-IC” (which mimics a viral
infection) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS, which
mimics a bacterial infection). These
substances cause immune system activation without infection. They induce fever and
cytokine production and can have substantial
effects on brain development if activation is
sufficiently intense or prolonged and if
exposure occurs during vulnerable
developmental stages.
Immune activation has been
demonstrated in mice to cause the three core
behavioral symptoms of autism: decreased
socialization and communication, and
increased repetitive behaviors (Malkova
2012). Immune activation has also been
shown to cause neuropathology (Weir 2015)
and behavioral abnormalities in monkeys
that resemble behaviors in human
schizophrenia and autism.</p>

It would make a lot of sense as this illness in its form didn&#39;t really exist before and started mostly in the 1980s [as yuppie flu]. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>im sorry to hear about your illness friend. Ive come to some information in regards to CFS. There is a special diet that comes from a book called &quot;The plant paradox&quot; by Dr. Gundry. It has been used with people with CFS with excellent results. I have something similar and this diet has given me almost miraculous results. Also look into detoxing, I recommend you look into Josh Macin and the detox dudes.  Anyway just wanted to mention it , it may help out. It is basically a low lectin diet. Thanks for that link and I wish you nothing but a full recovery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for responding. Tried most things, cant be cured as so many think [I was even told to go to meditation and the girl was adamant that I will be cured] This can be frustrating sometimes as I have meditated since my youth and she just wasn&#39;t taking my explanations into account at all.</p>

<p>M.E It is something at the mitochondrial level that is just not working as it should, like a defective battery, it just won&#39;t hold charge. also as it is late onset CFS [I prefer M.E as it is truer in meaning] it isn&#39;t likely to get better. 
I always explain it as being given £5 spending money whilst other people get £50 a day and things just cost a certain amount [hair washing = £2 for example, hoovering = £3 etc].</p>

<p>However I appreciate your ideas and will look into it. I have basically learned to just live with the little bit of energy that I am given daily and it works quite well.</p>

<p>I am still quite convinced that it is due to vaccines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh i absolutely think vaccines are a main culprit for many diseases including M.E.. I was injured by a tdap vaccine but have made a lot of progress thanks to food, specially what i put and not put in my body. I was always told that disease begins in the gut, like Hippocrates said, and i couldn&#39;t agree more. Food is the very first thing to look at when it comes to any disease. Fasting is another incredible tool to help heal the body as well. </p>

<p>Even though M.E. is a problem that seems to be coming from a deficient mitochondrial function, im willing to bet that its because the body is full of heavy metals and toxins that interfere with the bodies natural processes. Heavy metals are really hard to detox from specially if you have your detox pathways damaged. ex leaky gut.</p>

<p>Also, if you havent already, look into kratom. Ive heard good things from people with M.E. /CFS. God bless friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please add controversy surrounding the feds use of the anthrax shot and BT Vaccines on their own soldiers, which were pointed to as the likely cause or causes of the 11 symptoms which became known as Gulf War Syndrome.</p>

<p>The DOD made it illegal to not take a shot in 2009 (UCMJ), and in 2011 began their own department for the creation of counter-bio-weapons (vaccines). Perhaps they did this because Merk pharma has been embroiled in lawsuits by ex employees that all have data evidencing their allegations that Merk fudged saftey and efficacy data for over 20 years to retain patents. The DOD requires the same shots for DOD Civilians as it does for it&#39;s soldiers.</p>

<p>The DOD is and has been allowed to use New Investigational Drugs on soldiers, but after John D. Rockafeller stood before Congress and told the people that their government had likely caused a debacle by testing things on troops that may have consequences, Congress told the DOD to use documents to inform people before they give them the shot. It&#39;s a grey area for if people have a choice (they do but are told they don&#39;t).</p>

<p>In 1991 Australia changed their formula after 90 percent of the first troops came back from the person gulf with what later became known as Gulf War Syndrome. The US did not change their formula, which included an adjuvant called squaline that science later found reason not to trust. Squaline was included in an innoculation in Spain a while back, so I know its still in use in places, in spite of the controversy surrounding it.</p>

<p>Here is my story from when I proved the anthrax shot is still a danger to humans as of July 2011. The anthrax shot almost took my life and they swept it under the rug. <a href="https://joshua-ray.livejournal.com/180493.html">https://joshua-ray.livejournal.com/180493.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best argument against vaccination is the somewhat questionable efficacy, and the almost complete lack of safety.</p>

<p>3.6 billion dollars in awards from the vaccine Court were given out for mostly CHILDREN who were harmed. Many seriously harmed. By that I mean lifelong debilitation and/or DEATH.</p>

<p>There has been virtually no effort to properly monitor adverse events to the point where less than 5%, with some estimates closer to 1 or 2%, reporting rates for adverse events. This means that there is no real data to back any assertion of safety.</p>

<p>If you can provide evidence of both efficacy and safety, now&#39;s your chance. And not just for the individual vaccines, but for the entirety of the combined administration of all vaccines and its effects on small children or adults.</p>

<p>seeing as nobody has polio anymore</p>

<p>Tell that to the 10s of thousands of cases of &quot;non-acute flaccid paralysis&quot; that the polio vaccine recently caused in India.</p>

<p>In the 1950&#39;s, this polio vaccine-caused paralysis would have been classified as, you guessed it, polio!</p>

<p>When the vaccine was <em>clearly</em> making things worse, they reclassified polio to require a much narrower definition, effectively &quot;eliminating&quot; polio, when in reality paralysis cases were called something else.</p>

<p>Again, read the section on polio in my first Skeptic&#39;s Guide...it&#39;s been scientifically determined that elimination of the polio virus is <em>impossible</em>.</p>

<p>You should be warning us about the pro-vax studies which aren&#39;t using real placebos in safety studies and are removing people from studies if they get sick.  You&#39;ve got the whole reality upside down.</p>

<p>The so-called anti-vax side are people who have given up lucrative careers to get the truth out, the industry destroys people as soon as they dare find out the harm of a vaccine.  The money is in the pro-vaxx side, so that&#39;s why it&#39;s full of shills and weak characters, whereas the vaccine safety side is full of decent human beings trying to get the truth out, save lives and protect health.</p>

<p><strong>Experts complain of the &#39;witch hunt&#39; which takes place after any scientist reports on vaccine dangers</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Actually it was you who changed it, AP was talking about covertly using vaccines for sterilization in the third world.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>infant mortality had decreased while vaccinations have increased</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Correlation is not causation, as the studies shows the more vaccines the worse the infant mortality.  The reduction of infant mortality is linked to improved nutrition and sanitation.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>As to why infant mortality is higher in the USA versus other 1st world countries that vaccinate less, there could be a lot of factors.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li> It&#39;s not just the US, if you draw a graph showing which countries give the most vaccines, it&#39;s clear that the more a country gives the worse it&#39;s infant mortality.  This will be to do with vaccines causing SIDS and many autoimmune diseases and allergies.  Japan found that when they stopped vaccinating under 2&#39;s their infant mortality rate jumped up to best in the world, SIDS vanished in the country.  The unfortunate reality is that it is not safe to vaccinating children under the age of 2 as essential detoxifying enzymes are not yet present in the liver, so it any child under the age of 2 is being poisoned in one way or another with vaccines.</li>

Do yourself a favour and do a little research outside of the anti-vax bubble, how scientific studies and peer review journals work.   You and your bullshit peddling is leading to real harm. </p>
