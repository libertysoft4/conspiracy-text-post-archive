<p>I&#39;ve seen lots of people saying the NBA/NFL are rigged, something something Patriots 2002.   What about soccer?   I remember S Korea getting &quot;&quot;&quot;very lucky&quot;&quot;&quot; when they hosted the world cup and got all the way to the semis in 2002, with Spain and Italy being the victims.   Doping is another thing that supposedly barely ever happens (something like a handful out of 5000 tests) anyone have the scoop on that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is match fixing in football but mostly it is in markets you would expect such corruption (Asia, eastern Europe, Africa etc)</p>

<p>In my 31 years I believe there has only been one incident of match fixing / betting in the top division in England and that was in the 90’s and involved Bruce Grobbalar and Hans Seagars. </p>

<p>Doping and drugs are anyones guess. You would have to expect there to be plenty of it. Man City’s manager has always been involved with wrong doing and doping. He was banned as a player and is rumoured to have shady doctors and medical staff around at all his clubs except at Bayern Munich.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s gotten so bad that it appears the can review video of any play sequence to find violations to retroactively make calls against us. The first example of this was last year when after a game winning three, they reviewed the play and decided that the timekeeper had missed a few milliseconds in starting the clock, and that we would not have made the bucket if timed correctly. We were given the loss. Of course they failed to note the overun of the clock on the stoppage directly previous to the final play, and several just prior. Soon they&#39;ll say a misthrown tip to start the game erroneously caused us to win a game.</p>

<p>For English soccer it is pretty clear that refs and the Football Association don&#39;t like my team, Chelsea. They even used video review in the midweek game and got it wrong. So wrong the ref association came out and said it was wrong afterwards. </p>

<p>I&#39;d put most of this down to human&#39;s being terrible at being prefect in judgement and lack of accountability rather than deliberate mass fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think every major sport is manipulated to a degree. That being said, some are easier to manipulate/rig than others, usually because of the way the rules work or the number of refs on the field/court at any given time. I would imagine that soccer, with one main referee running around in front of the whole stadium, would be a bit harder to fix than American football, where 5 or 6 referees are everywhere and a lot more action happens.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re genuinely interested, this blog is what opened my eyes to sports conspiracies in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen enough games to know that sports are rigged. Teams that had disasters in their city the previous year winning championships to teams with big markets consistently getting calls against smaller market teams(especially in playoffs, post-season). Yet fanatics of sports and sports teams don&#39;t want to believe, I am just crazy to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Start of the NHL season in 1989 (yes I am old) I said if Calgary wins this year this whole thing is rigged.  Sure enough they did. </p>

<p>Lanny MacDonald announced his retirement and if any player could not go without a cup ring it was him. They let it happen. </p>

<p>Since then I have paid attention  to things like playoff games. Notice how many go the full 7 games? </p>

<p>Millions are made in ad revenue per game </p>

<p>Sports are a show. A distraction and they milk them for all they are worth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nowadays one hardly has to &quot;fix&quot; a game as they did in the old days. Nowadays you can bet on ANYTHING that is related to ANY game. Not that hard to make money of the number of corners or throw-ins in a soccer-game if you can only get one of the players on the field to help you out a little. Just an example of how easy it is to &quot;rig&quot; a modern game without rigging the actual result.</p>
