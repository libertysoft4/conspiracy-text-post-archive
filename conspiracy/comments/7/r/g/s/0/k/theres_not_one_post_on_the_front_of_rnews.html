<p>Between 3 weeks and 40 weeks a miriad of things can go wrong, fetus’ with only a partial brain and who will die within secinds of being born still have a heart beat. I could go on but I’m sure you get the point that the tweet was a blatant lie and has no basic in science or fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So maybe the baby can’t survive without the assistance of the mother’s womb at that point but I don’t agree that “life” doesn’t exist at that point. Nor does it make it a fact that life doesn’t exist. If you plant a seed and it begins to germinate through the shell...but then you neglect the seed of water, light  and soil then it will die before it can become a plant. It doesn’t mean that the seed had no life just because it never made it to the point where the embryonic root dig into the ground to farm it’s own nutrients. It was on its way to having independent life from the embryo but the conditions were changed so life stopped at the first stage....I think you get where I am going. My point is that as the above user said, that is an opinion on when life starts, not a fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stated a fact, and followed it up with an assumption. Is there a problem with that? Does that make the first not a fact?</p>

<p>Late term abortions (after 21 weeks) are so rare because they&#39;re offered in so few places and pose such a great threat to the health of the mother, that it would make sense that most of them are for the health of the mother. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gave a number. That’s a stat. You’re obsessed with people believing in your science. We don’t know when life begins. We have witnessed a spark of energy created when the sperm meets the egg but to this day there are nothing but theories about what has happened at that point. Is it just an electrical spark? Is it a soul being created? What happened at that moment of conception? There are many theories just like with abortions. If you are so obtuse about everything then what’s the point of presenting your theories. You’re not changing my mind and I doubt anyone else’s. You’re just looking for agreement.  I definitely don’t agree that their is no life created until the baby is out of the womb....in the cases where the mother would die then yes we should use our scientific advancements to save the mothers life because ALL life is precious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. All life is precious, and no one&#39;s opinion is better than anyone else&#39;s. Is a 6 week old fetus more important than a 2 year old cow? We slaughter animals by the billions, who is to say they don&#39;t have souls? There is no right and wrong on abortion - just your own opinion. </p>

<p>Rape, incest, disease, all valid reasons to get abortions. Abortion as a form of birth control (someone that gets several) is wrong. But making birth control readily accessible should help with that - on top of fewer abortions, it reduces the number of unwanted children which likely end up requiring state assistance. I&#39;d rather the state pay for BC than a lifelong &quot;state-assisted&quot; person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t want lifelong state assisted children either just like I don’t want life long state assisted illegal immigrants. It is unfair to everyone involved. Besides, People end up having children in those situations anyway because they look at children as paychecks thanks to our welfare system. There are thousands (assumption amount not fact) of people trying to have children right now that would adopt and raise the children without state assistance. If the mother doesn’t want the child then we will find a home. People adopt newborns from every corner of the planet to bring back to the US. We are a nation of incredibly helpful and giving people regardless of what we are told on the television....as for a cow, well that gets in to the circle of life argument. Is a lion evil for eating a gazelle or was that how life was meant. Not for pointless death but for balance of the ecosystem to provide nutrients for life. Dead fetuses are not being used for consumption of nutrients to foster life (at least I pray not but I have my doubts after some of those planned parenthood undercover videos)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An abortion is a lot cheaper than 9 months of medical bills when you can&#39;t afford health insurance. Bringing a baby into the world costs thousands and thousands of dollars in medical costs, days of missed work, and all the other costs of day to day things (clothes, more food, etc) that many people (especially poor, single mothers) can not afford. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not a bible pusher or anything where I believe condoms and birth control are sins or anything. I’m not even that sure I believe in Catholicism anymore. I believe life comes from an unexplainable universal “light” that some call God. .... My wife is on birth control because I’m done. It doesn’t mean I’m done having sex. I think of them as responsible moves. So yeah I support providing birth control. That’s what planned parenthood was sold as + gynecologists for those who couldn’t afford them. That’s not what it became...sex is for creating love and creating families but our society has turned it into a pretty perverse activity more about immediate pleasure than love. There are also ways to do it without birth control if you have a stable partner and you avoid having sex for about 10 days in a cycle while a woman is fertile. That’s not the way our society treats sex though. I don’t claim to know the fears of a single mother and if there are doctors willing to do it then that’s on their conscience. I just don’t think the state should be involved in any way with the abortion process. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m legitimately confused. Is this something that was being talked about before today? All of the sudden it&#39;s all over right-wing sites (from looking at memeorandum), but not elsewhere.</p>

<p>I know the overall subject of FISA has been discussed, but it&#39;s weird how out of nowhere this memo discussion is. It feels like some switch was flipped and suddenly a bunch of people are declaring it the most important thing ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but a memo isn&#39;t like a bomb going off. There&#39;s a lead up to it. I assume the memo is based on information that had already been presented to them. Why would a summary of information they&#39;ve received over the previous months suddenly be so urgently important?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I followed it. It&#39;s a terrible analogy. Being gay is one simple piece of information that is a binary, either you know it or you don&#39;t. This is a complex issue where a person spent 20 years doing business with Russia rife with mob ties, red flags and suspicious business deals. It&#39;s not a fair or good analogy in any way shape or form.  People may &quot;know&quot; that trump has done 20 years of business in Russia, and that it&#39;s common knowledge that big money doesn&#39;t flow through Russia except through the mob, but it&#39;s not so simple a topic as &quot;either you&#39;re gay or you&#39;re not.&quot; How in the same breath trump supporters say &quot;everyone knows so it can&#39;t be blackmail&quot; and &quot;the public has no right to see Trump&#39;s financial or tax returns because he has nothing to hide&quot;.

<p>Have you seen the voting patterns here? Who, exactly, feels more at home? Who seems more likely to be going along with &quot;the norm&quot; and being on the receiving end of more upvotes than down? Who is that?</p>

<p>As for your tired old &quot;cult of personality&quot; bullshit... you can save it. We&#39;ve heard it all before. We heard the same said about Obama and his fanatical devotees. Again: who cares?

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re really fucking reaching to defend that bs analogy, and you know it. The question of someone being gay(that&#39;s a specific term btw) or not, is a simple yes or no question. Are you so desperate to not be the &quot;norm&quot; that you&#39;ll deny reality and logic? I think we both know the answer to that. Cultists see no nuance. Your analogy was absurd and has no meaning. Here, fill in the blank. It is (possible, probable, unlikely, impossible) that Trump owes money to Russian mob connected oligarchs. As a bonus, explain to me what that has to do at all with whether or not people know that trump has done business in Russia and has made suspicious biz deals. It&#39;s all moot anyway, because he could go on TV tomorrow, admit he owes 50 mil to Russian oligarchs and you would still be sitting here trying to come up with absurd rationalization as to why that&#39;s somehow ok or not a big deal. Yes. Cultists. I use that word carefully.</p>

<p>No, just refuting your claim that I&#39;m &quot;at home&quot; in &quot;an insane doublethink community&quot; here with pure facts. You got more upvotes than I did, which means you are more &quot;at home&quot; here and more at peace with the mainstream narrative here.</p>

<p>You bore me with the &quot;Russian mob / oligarch / lizard man&quot; stories and hypothetical scenarios, by the way. Like I said, you can&#39;t step back from treason to just say he did some business deals with shady Russians. You could have had that as the story from the beginning, but it&#39;s too late now. You&#39;re a prosecutor who charged him with murder, and now the jury isn&#39;t having any of it because you&#39;ve failed to prove your case... so you want the jury to consider simple assault instead, just so you can get your little win.</p>

<p>A little bit.</p>

<p>The point is, I&#39;m tired of the endless allegations, hypothetical scenarios, and rumors. It&#39;s boring to me now.</p>

<p>And, when we have been told over and over that this was no doubt about it, 100% collusion, Putin&#39;s Puppet, all of that... and now just want to nail him on any little thing to prove a point.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it again: you can&#39;t step back from treason at this point. &quot;Trump Russia collusion&quot; is what you need. That&#39;s the only prize to be won here. Any less of a crime is minor in comparison, and would make it hard to justify a 2+ year long expensive, politically biased, and possibly illegal, investigation in to Trump and co.</p>

<p>It better be, for their sake. But it seems more and more likely that they&#39;ve switched away from looking at collusion and are just trying to &quot;get him&quot; on something to justify their existence.</p>

<p>And the thing is... if you have 2+ years, unlimited resources, teams of lawyers, and clearly biased intel agents, you&#39;re going to find something on anyone. Just imagine if any other politician or even another kind of public person was put under this much scrutiny... they wouldn&#39;t look great by the end of it.</p>

<p>Obviously he&#39;s the president so he should be under more scrutiny than most people, but where do they draw the line? How many years of his presidency are they going to tarnish, with little to show from their investigations? Do they just enjoy being a cloud of negativity hanging over his head?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think he looked great before he was elected, tbh, and I’m sure some people do enjoy having a cloud of negativity over his head just as some people enjoy seeing one over Obama or Hilary. I’m not sure if you remember when Clinton was president but the Lewinski scandal stayed around for a long time with Trump himself parading some of Clinton’s accusers around as recently as 2016. So political scandals have a way of tarnishing reputations forever. It won’t just be: “Turns out there was no collusion with Russia by Trump so back to business!” Sex scandals, money laundering, bribes, shady business dealings... he will be lucky if he doesn’t go to jail which I think is what some people really want.</p>

<p>I don’t see the recent allegations as pivoting away from collusion just more revelations as information comes to light. And you keep mentioning 2+ years but he has only been in office a year with the Mueller investigation being shorter than that.</p>

<p>How so? The story they are parroting seems to be as though there was some horrible actions undertaken by Obama, Clinton, and the DOJ and FBI.

<p>The GOP leaks everything. There&#39;s nothing to this, otherwise it would have come out already. This will be more spin, nothing else (just like the whole &quot;Here&#39;s the <em>real</em> collusion: The DNC paid Fusion GPS!).</p>

<p>No, just refuting your claim that I&#39;m &quot;at home&quot; in &quot;an insane doublethink community&quot; here with pure facts. You got more upvotes than I did, which means you are more &quot;at home&quot; here and more at peace with the mainstream narrative here.</p>

<p>What kind of shitty cult votes against its own member (me, apparently) in favor of an outsider (you, I guess)? I&#39;d leave that cult in a second. What&#39;s the point of it if they&#39;re not gonna back you up, right? :-)</p>

<p>You bore me with the &quot;Russian mob / oligarch / lizard man&quot; stories and hypothetical scenarios, by the way. Like I said, you can&#39;t step back from treason to just say he did some business deals with shady Russians. You could have had that as the story from the beginning, but it&#39;s too late now. You&#39;re a prosecutor who charged him with murder, and now the jury isn&#39;t having any of it because you&#39;ve failed to prove your case... so you want the jury to consider simple assault instead, just so you can get your little win.</p>
