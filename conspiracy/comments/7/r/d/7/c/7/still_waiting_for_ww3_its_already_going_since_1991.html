<p>Get it ?</p>

<p>The war against the Third World.</p>

<p>Have you noticed that a lot of chaos is brewing in the Middle East, Africa and (poor) South-East Asian nations ?</p>

<p>1991 Operation Desert Storm was the first active combat operation (aggressive war) of &quot;western&quot;/Christian troops in the Islamic home domain (Arabic nations) since the last Christian Templar crusade ended with the fall of Acre in 1291. This is exactly <strong>7</strong>00 years difference and not a coincidence.</p>

<p>OP:DS was the first exercise to test new US. weapons against the older US. materiel supplied to Saddam Husseins Iraqi military used the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988).</p>

<p>Then the 9/11 false-flag happened and now the western world hates Islamic people after almost 100 years of peace since the fall of the Ottoman Empire (WW1).  </p>

<p>In 2001 the US. govt chopped down the Islamic Taliban govt., not because some cave-dwellers magically learned to fly modern planes, while dodging the entire US. Airforce from intercepting them, but because they cut the Poppy flower / Opium production down next to zero, which was of course a thorn in the eye of the most drug-addicted nation on the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. All part of the Oded Yinon plan. There will continue to be continuous war throughout the world I believe. The completely evil war on terrorism got the powers that be a lot of benefits. Not only did they get the resources, the oil, the minerals, the land from these third world nations, they also got more power in first world nations. People were begging for more security measures after 9/11 that&#39;s where the PATRIOT Act comes in. Be careful for anything the establishment tries to push on to you if it takes away your freedom and privacy in return for &quot;safety&quot;. I think another fake Cold War is a possibility sometime in the next 25 years </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the &quot;people begged for more security after 9/11&quot; is utter bs though. The news conspired to push that narrative, just like they continue to conspire with organizations today.   I never heard anyone say anything irl about wanted to be more secure because of 9/11. That was a false narrative pushed to help the government. The news was complicit in the events of that day. </p>

<p>Edit add... not to discredit anything you said, just noting that facet of your statement was in essence it&#39;s own conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US sold Afghan heroin to fund a secret army in the 80&#39;s to fight the Soviets. This army later became Al Qaeda. The US gave the secret army jihadist literature, religious motivation for war, tons of equipment, and trained them. Some sources:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Afridi was a key player in the Afghan war of resistance against the Soviet Union&#39;s occupying troops in the decade up to 1989. It is a matter of record that top US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officials believed in the early 1980s that they would never be able to justify a multibillion-dollar budget from the government to provide support to the mujahideen in the fight against the Red Army. As a result, they decided to generate funds through the poppy-rich Afghan soil and heroin production and smuggling to finance the Afghan war. Afridi was the kingpin of this plan. All of the major Afghan warlords, except for the Northern Alliance&#39;s Ahmed Shah Masoud, who had his own opium fiefdom in northern Afghanistan, were a part of Afridi&#39;s coalition of drug traders in the CIA-sponsored holy war against the Soviets. <a href="http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/CL04Df01.html">Link</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was released from prison right after 9/11 for &quot;unknown reasons&quot; and the opium production in Afghanistan skyrocketed shortly thereafter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you need a bit more context: about 100 years of peace were ended with the Sionist media &quot;blame the moslem&quot; campaign after 9/11, this peace began with 1918 (end of ww1) between the Islamic world (Ottoman Empire controlled Arabia, Egypt etc.) and the Christian world.

    <div class="md"><p>Bro that ORB study seems fishy. They just, what, go and interview a total of a few hundred people, survey like 1200 others, and then say &quot;yeah they all agreed it was totally like around almost exactly close to a million&quot;? lol I guess I don&#39;t understand their methodology, because that&#39;s all that they talk about is a survey and a handful of interviews. Guess I don&#39;t understand how that can beat, like, a census comparison or something. </p>
