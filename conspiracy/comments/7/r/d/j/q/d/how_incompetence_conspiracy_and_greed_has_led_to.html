<p>Many people think Flint is the only city with major lead problems, but it&#39;s not. There are cities all over the country with bad water, and one of the reasons they don&#39;t know about it is because it&#39;s covered up. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Guardian: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/22/water-lead-content-tests-us-authorities-distorting-flint-crisis">US authorities distorting tests to downplay lead content of water</a> </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;NYC fudged records to show day care centers’ water was tested for lead, but no tests were performed. DOHMH — the agency that&#39;s required to inspect all 11,000 child care centers in New York City annually — <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-faked-day-care-centers-lead-water-level-test-records-article-1.2686760">had more or less given up on the task.&quot;</a></p></li>
<li><p>CNN: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/28/us/epa-lead-in-u-s-water-systems/">5,300 U.S. water systems are in violation of lead rules</a></p></li>
<li><p>A USA Today investigation has identified <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/11/nearly-2000-water-systems-fail-lead-tests/81220466/">&quot;almost 2,000 additional water systems spanning all 50 states</a> where testing has shown excessive levels of lead contamination over the past four years, and at least 180 of the water systems failed to notify consumers about the high lead levels as federal rules require.&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Why is lead in the water? Because of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2509614/">The Lead Lobby</a>, a lot of the city pipes that carry your water (not just pipes in your house) contain high levels of lead. Many of these are still in use. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a pretty good link on crumbling paint, industrial waste, and plumbing all contributing to high levels of lead:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-testing/">A Reuters examination of lead testing results across the country found almost 3,000 areas with poisoning rates far higher than in the tainted Michigan city.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Lead is only one issue we face. There are many other potential contaminants.</p>

<p>As of 2010, it was estimated that 84,000 industrial chemicals were used in the United States, with about 700 introduced annually.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/03/AR2010010302110.html">Nearly 20 percent are secret, according to the EPA, their names and physical properties guarded from consumers and virtually all public officials under a little-known federal provision.</a></p>

<p>It is worth pointing out that an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/us/17water.html">extremely tiny percentage of these chemicals are tested for and regulated in tap water.</a> Since we don&#39;t know what many of these chemicals are, it&#39;s very difficult to test for their presence in tap water. </p>

<p>We obtain our water from lakes or rivers, which go through an insufficient filtering process. If the water in the lake or river is polluted with a chemical that is difficult to remove, then your tap water will also be polluted. Since we only test for about 100 contaminants, we are taking a risk every time we drink from a tap. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/us/13water.html">Records analyzed by The New York Times</a> indicate that the Clean Water Act has been violated more than 506,000 times since 2004, by more than 23,000 companies and other facilities, according to reports submitted by polluters themselves. Companies sometimes test what they are dumping only once a quarter, so the actual number of days when they broke the law is often far higher. And some companies illegally avoid reporting their emissions, say officials, so infractions go unrecorded.&quot; (article written in 2009)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s an example of what gets through the filters at water treatment plants: <a href="http://time.com/4928759/plastic-fiber-tap-water-study/">94 percent of the tap water in the US is contaminated with plastic fibers.</a></p>

<p>A good example of what happens under these conditions is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html">Dupont&#39;s &quot;C8,&quot; which caused a variety of medical problems for surrounding populations.</a> It was also expensive and time-consuming to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/03/03/how-dupont-concealed-the-dangers-of-the-new-teflon-toxin/">figure out what Dupont replaced C8 with, and that chemical was also making its way into a nearby river.</a></p>

<p>If you think about how difficult it is to show that a specific contaminant is having a specific effect on a population, you should realize that C8 and other similar contamination problems are the tip of the iceberg. It is guaranteed that there are numerous cases that we don&#39;t yet know about.</p>

<h1>Other routes of exposure:</h1>

<p>Water is not the only route of exposure. We are also exposed to various chemicals through car seats, furniture, shampoo, cosmetics, beds, fragrances, etc. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many Americans assume that the chemicals in their shampoos, detergents and other consumer products have been thoroughly tested and proved to be safe. This assumption is wrong. Unlike pharmaceuticals or pesticides, industrial chemicals do not have to be tested before they are put on the market. Under the law regulating chemicals, producers are only rarely required to provide the federal government with the information necessary to assess safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/sunday-review/think-those-chemicals-have-been-tested.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/sunday-review/think-those-chemicals-have-been-tested.html?_r=0</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>U.S. Government Has Little Authority to Stop Unsafe Cosmetics.</p>

<p>Under federal law, cosmetics companies don&#39;t have to disclose chemicals or gain approval for the 2,000 products that go on the market every year. And removing a cosmetic from sale takes a battle in federal court.</p>

<p>Joseph H. Guth, a lawyer and biochemist at University of California, Berkeley, said the cosmetics industry “is insulated behind the burden of proof” required under the law. Guth said the burden of proof should shift to the manufacturers to present testing information before products go on the market instead of making the government prove harm to get them off the market.</p>

<p>“People think cosmetics are tested for safety. They are not. It&#39;s not like pharmaceuticals or even pesticides where some data are required. All the same, people slather cosmetics directly on their bodies, and absorb them in creams, deodorants, fragrances and shampoos, and ingest them in lipstick.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/us-government-has-little-authority-to-stop-unsafe-cosmetics/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/us-government-has-little-authority-to-stop-unsafe-cosmetics/</a></p>

<p>What has been done about this  so far?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It could take centuries for EPA to test all the unregulated chemicals under a new landmark bill. </p>

<p>Synthetic chemicals surround us. They’re in our takeout containers, children’s toys, furniture and clothes. There’s BPA in our receipts and flame retardants in our children’s carseats. You might think the government has carefully reviewed every chemical for safety before it hits the market. But it hasn’t. <strong>In fact, there are more than 80,000 chemicals registered for use today, many of which haven’t been studied for safety by any government agency.</strong></p>

<p>The new law requires EPA to test tens of thousands of unregulated chemicals currently on the market, and the roughly 2,000 new chemicals introduced each year, but quite slowly. The EPA will review a minimum of 20 chemicals at a time, and each has a seven-year deadline. Industry may then have five years to comply after a new rule is made. <strong>At that pace it could take centuries for the agency to finish its review.</strong></p>

<p>“The bill doesn’t provide EPA enough money to get through this enormous backlog of old, and in some cases, very dangerous chemicals to assess whether they need to be regulated or even banned,” he said. “It will take EPA decades to get through the thousand most dangerous chemicals that EPA itself has said need urgent review.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/it-could-take-centuries-for-epa-to-test-all-the-unregulated-chemicals-under-a-new-landmark-bill/">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/it-could-take-centuries-for-epa-to-test-all-the-unregulated-chemicals-under-a-new-landmark-bill/</a></p>

<p>There isn&#39;t very much information about how two or more chemicals interact in our bodies. When scientists study the toxicity of chemicals, they study the effects on animals of one chemical alone at a time. Very rarely do they study two or more chemical combinations and how they interact. Some chemical combinations can have multiplicative effects (&quot;synergistic toxicity&quot;), which means the toxicity of the combination is much more severe than we would have thought. Here is one example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-09/ind-lso090815.php">They show that some oestrogens such as ethinyloestradiol (one of the active ingredients of contraceptive pills) and organochlorine pesticides such as trans-nonachlor, although very weakly active on their own, have the ability to bind simultaneously to a receptor located in the cell nucleus, and to activate it synergistically.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Food Additives:</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>The explosion of new food additives coupled with an easing of oversight requirements is allowing manufacturers to avoid the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for ensuring the safety of chemicals streaming into the food supply.</p>

<p>And in hundreds of cases, the FDA doesn’t even know of the existence of new additives, which can include chemical preservatives, flavorings and thickening agents, records and interviews show.</p>

<p>“We simply do not have the information to vouch for the safety of many of these chemicals,” said Michael Taylor, the FDA’s deputy commissioner for food.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/food-additives-on-the-rise-as-fda-scrutiny-wanes/2014/08/17/828e9bf8-1cb2-11e4-ab7b-696c295ddfd1_story.html?utm_term=.0932f5f423e6">https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/food-additives-on-the-rise-as-fda-scrutiny-wanes/2014/08/17/828e9bf8-1cb2-11e4-ab7b-696c295ddfd1_story.html?utm_term=.0932f5f423e6</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In practice, almost 80% of chemical additives directly—intentionally—added to food lack the relevant information needed to estimate the amount that consumers can safely eat in FDA&#39;s own database and 93% lack reproductive or developmental toxicity data, although FDA requires feeding toxicology data for these chemicals.</p>

<p>Of the totality of FDA-regulated additives, both directly and indirectly allowed in food, almost two-thirds don’t have publicly available feeding data.</p>

<p>In the absence of toxicology data on the majority of chemicals added to food, the scientific basis for determinations of safety to humans may be questioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link. Here are a few more on radiation contamination in drinking water:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Research into Arizona town&#39;s uranium-contaminated water supply sparks change</p>

<p>Town leaders want to know why the state agency issued the first public notice about the danger in August of 2015, despite having reports of chemical samples showing federally unsafe contamination levels more than a decade earlier.</p>

<p>&quot;Folks have been using the water for so many years without being told,&quot; said Raymond Smith Jr., a community leader in Sanders. &quot;Everybody is wondering, why are we just now getting this information?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.12news.com/article/news/local/arizona/research-into-arizona-towns-uranium-contaminated-water-supply-sparks-change/124812713">http://www.12news.com/article/news/local/arizona/research-into-arizona-towns-uranium-contaminated-water-supply-sparks-change/124812713</a></p>

<p>Kathleen Hartnett White, the former chair of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Senate committee honed in on a 2004 document that showed White openly supported a TCEQ policy of subtracting the margin of error from tests for radiation contamination in water. If a public water supply was found to have amounts of naturally occurring radium or uranium that exceeded federal limits, Texas regulators would subtract the margin of error and lower the results. Under White’s leadership, the agency presented testimony that said, “Maintaining this calculation procedure will eliminate approximately 35 violations.”</p>

<p>A violation of the Environmental Protection Agency’s maximum limit for radiation would require water systems to notify citizens and take action to clean up the contamination or provide an alternate source of drinking water. White and other leaders in Texas worried about the high costs that might be incurred by water systems for a violation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wonderful, well researched post! This deserves to be much higher.  </p>

<p>Corporate and government pollution schemes are the most commonly verified conspiracies out there, but receive relatively little attention comparative to the damage they cause to our health and the health of our environment. In general, these types of conspiracies lack clear cut political context, and call into question deeper systematic issues with economic institutions and behavior -- thus they are more complex (and consequently, more &quot;boring&quot; to the media) than issues which can be used as political attack fodder. </p>

<p>Another &quot;vector&quot; that we need to focus on more is the pharmaceuticals.</p>
