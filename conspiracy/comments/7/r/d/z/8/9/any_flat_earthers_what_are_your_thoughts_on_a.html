        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi, everybody. I&#39;ve been sitting on an idea for a while and I wanted to reach out and see what your thoughts on this are. Feel free to answer if you&#39;re not a Flat Earther.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a student journalist, and I want to make a short video profile of people who associate with the Flat Earth movement. Conspiracy theorists face a lot of ridicule by the media but I find the community to be a great example of people exercising their free speech and questioning mainstream beliefs. I think it may also be symbolic of a greater struggle against current politics. I would want to focus more on the person, than the conspiracy aspect.</p>

<p>I have some questions, if you have the time to answer:</p>

<p>a) theoretically, how open would you be to having your political/scientific opinions recorded (not necessarily in a video) and published? </p>

<p>b) are there certain aspects of this that you think it is imperative to cover?</p>

<p>c) I live in Canada. Don&#39;t tell me your city (unless you want to) but is there a sizeable population of the community in Canada (esp. British Columbia?)</p>

<p>d) lastly, is this something you&#39;d be interested in watching? If not, what would make it pique your interest?</p>

<p>Thanks so much to anyone who can help me out. I really appreciate it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should probably do it on the idea of alternative views on the planet/our existence in general- if you want to keep the flat earth type topic. The flat earth theory is what brought me to this sub, b/c I wanted to see it debated. </p>

<p>It was the first conspiracy in a while to really make me question what I&#39;ve already believed in for years. I think people hate it mostly b/c we are so invested in aliens, and space travel, and that puts those in question. Cue somebody to hit me with, &quot;No, we hate it b/c it&#39;s retarded!&quot; and run away.</p>

<p>It has been attacked more than any conspiracy that I&#39;ve ever seen. You can rant about shape shifting lizard people all day long, and never get a peep in opposition. Mention that flat earth has some merit to it, and people come out of ye old woodworks to get this visceral hostility to you. This fascinates me, as well as the topic of what is reality in general.</p>

<p>Essentially the flat earth conundrum is more complex than most people give it credit for. There are problems with a globe earth/heliocentric model, and this is what pulls most people in to consider it.</p>

<p>That being said, people have points against flat earth, but seem to overlook or assume that those things makes all the things like Eric Dubay&#39;s 200 proofs the earth is flat not exist or still be valid points.</p>

<p>Personally I recognize that both (all?) models, flat, sphere, pear- I mean &quot;oblate spheroid,&quot; hollow, etc. all have their quirks and anomalies, which just send me running back to Camp Simulation Theory, like Elon Musk believes.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Flat earth is fascinating to open minded people, but gets gut wrench reactions from many. They think, &quot;I can prove x is a problem on flat earth, so everything else is false, ergo earth is a ball.&quot; Nevermind that there are still problems with sphere earth. Then there&#39;s hollow earth guys. You should cover the whole fight, if you choose this subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It gets attacked because it&#39;s a classic example of human stupidity and old, dated knowledge being replaced. Also, pretty much everyone hears the story of Columbus (I&#39;m pretty sure he didn&#39;t actually think the earth was flat, but the point still stands) and the story of Galileo in school. It has also gained popularity as a meme/joke.  </p>

<p>Saying the earth is flat gets a similar reaction to saying 2+2=5, and both ideas are similarly ridiculous.   </p>

<p>I actually watched that video. It&#39;s one of the dumbest things I&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s just blatant falsehoods and lies over and over again going on and on.  </p>

<p>The earth isn&#39;t flat. I&#39;m all about being open minded, but if you think the earth is flat, you are about as far from being open minded as you can get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello you! I agree with a lot of what you say, except for your faith in NASA Freemasons, and I guess this having zero merit. </p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t consider myself a flat earther, but they do have some points I&#39;d like you to address for me. The biggest one off the top of my head is curved water. Other than a drop, or water curving as it pours, can you show water curving in a mass? </p>

<p>They have a point with the, &quot;water level&quot; always being level, and some pictures that appear to defy curvature, (i.e. the world record photograph). There&#39;s the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-motorola&amp;amp;ei=OEdhWsasBYGwsAW7yaboAg&amp;amp;q=chicago+mirage+picture&amp;amp;oq=chicago+mirage+&amp;amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.1.4.0l2j0i22i30k1l3.3927.6687.0.8971.21.15.0.2.2.0.213.2253.0j13j1.14.0....0...1c.1j4.64.mobile-gws-serp..13.8.1107...35i39k1j0i67k1j0i20i264k1j0i131i20i264k1j0i131k1j0i131i20i263i264k1j0i20i263k1.169.PAUsCVZ2tOE">Chicago mirage picture</a> that several guys have appeared to recreate, and drive to from one shore to the other on camera. </p>

<p>There&#39;s places that are known for their flatness such as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-motorola&amp;amp;ei=3UdhWvHNMMyEsAXUxIaYBg&amp;amp;q=world+largest+salt+flat+located&amp;amp;oq=largest+flat+locat&amp;amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.1.0.0i22i30k1.33494.42562.0.45022.44.33.0.6.6.0.454.6052.0j26j4j1j1.32.0....0...1.1j4.64.mobile-gws-serp..25.19.3044...0j35i39k1j0i67k1j0i131k1j0i20i263k1j0i20i263i264k1j0i20i264k1j0i22i10i30k1.171.Lj6u89T6Bxk">this</a>, which seem to defy curvature.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> funny also, that people have seemingly conflicting arguments such as, &quot;You can&#39;t go high enough to see the curvature, it&#39;s like an ant on a beach ball...&quot; But then say you can see the curvature from the beach, watching ships, and from airplane windows. Even though no matter how high up you go, (so long as it&#39;s not a fisheye GoPro) it <em>does</em> appear to be flat.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not claiming a believer, just have seen some possible trickery that made me scratch my head.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Other than a drop, or water curving as it pours, can you show water curving in a mass  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The curving in small amounts of water is due to surface tension. The reason why water &quot;curves&quot; in the ocean is because it&#39;s sitting on the earth, which is round. Before you say &quot;then why doesn&#39;t it flow downhill&quot;, it&#39;s not downhill. Gravity is all even on that surface.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They have a point with the, &quot;water level&quot; always being level  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they don&#39;t. <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/dscn3193-comparison-jpg.24254/">Care to explain?</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s the Chicago mirage picture  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You explained that one yourself. It&#39;s a mirage. It&#39;s not visible like that 99% of the time. If the earth was flat, you would always be able to see it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s places that are known for their flatness such as this, which seem to defy curvature.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does it defy curvature? Are you saying that because you cannot see the curve from ground level easy it is therefor flat? Really?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&#39;t go high enough to see the curvature, it&#39;s like an ant on a beach ball...  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? Who says you can&#39;t go high up enough to see the curve? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmkbAql5_jU&amp;amp;t=0s">The curve starts to become very apparent at 40,000ft.</a> He moves the camera up and down a lot. Definitely not a fish-eye lens.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But then say you can see the curvature from the beach  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the image I linked already.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>from airplane windows  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, see what I just linked. Flights at 40,000ft are not that common, but there are some routs that take them. I was on a flight a while ago that briefly went up that high. Curve is definitely visible.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>ven though no matter how high up you go, (so long as it&#39;s not a fisheye GoPro) it does appear to be flat.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I just explained, no.  </p>

<p>just have seen some possible trickery that made me scratch my head.  </p>

<p>Please provide the trickery. I&#39;m a debunking machine.</p>

<p>Oh come on man. You have eyes in your head. Please use them. That is quite clearly not caused by a wave. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/eDneKS4.jpg">It&#39;s a wave</a>. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KhQpUIA.jpg">Definitely a wave.</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about you lay down the top problems with any of those top 200  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well for one, a significant portion are riding off claiming that gravity doesn&#39;t exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ax_YpQsy88?t=1495">Here is a blatant lie</a>. You can buy some tickets right <a href="https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/jnb/syd/johannesburg-to-sydney">here</a>. In fact, the existence of that flight completely disproves the flat earth, as that flight cannot exist on a flat earth model. Many planes do still take the around rout because there are simply not very many people taking that rout, so they would rather funnel the people taking those flights onto more common routs.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also can you explain how the Coriolis effect can allegedly change the flight path of bullets  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can <em>very</em> slightly change the path of bullets on very long shots (I&#39;m talking 1000+ yards).  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but not airplanes  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And another lie. Of course they are effected, but they naturally correct for it, and any effect that it does have is massively outweighed by atmospheric winds. Same with bullets, actually.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>or why the earth doesn&#39;t move out from under hovering helicopters or balloons?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh come on man. The atmosphere is moving along with the spinning earth, and thus objects in the atmosphere move along with it as well. The fact that you have to state repeated, blatant inaccuracies should be a glaring sign at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No upvotes from me yet tonight. For the second time in a row, you have sent me essentially word salad. </p>

<p>&quot;You can see _ from _, b/c said so,&quot; with no actual argument against their claims. &quot;I was in a plane, and could see a curve once..&quot;</p>

<p>Again, I thought you were a math and science guy- blow me away with how their curvature math is wrong or something. </p>

<p>&quot;You would be able to see the the buildings on any day if the earth was flat.&quot;</p>

<p>That is the same argument people use for everything. Ever drive in fog? Someone can be driving directly at you, with high beams on, and you won&#39;t see them until surprisingly close. Fog is essentially a ground level cloud, so the same phenomenon still applies everywhere else. </p>

<p>As for flights, there&#39;s video after video of people showing different sides of the flight path problem. Some people can show some that don&#39;t make sense on ball earth, or how planes disappear off of GPS in the southern hemisphere, and some show some like you sent me. </p>

<p>Yes, there&#39;s locations on the popular flat earth AE map model that don&#39;t make sense, there&#39;s also things on spinning sphere earth that don&#39;t make sense. Traveling with or against rotation comes to mind (other than the countless videos that are just guys showing opposite/counter scenarios like you sent me) but there&#39;s a <em>ton</em> of them. </p>

<p>Lmao. A convenient excuse. Normally &quot;shill&quot; is the direction they go.  </p>

<p>Yup, but there isn&#39;t fog on a perfectly clear day. You just claim that there is mystical, impenetrable fog 99+% that no one can see yet still block you from seeing distant objects.     </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there&#39;s locations on the popular flat earth AE map model that don&#39;t make sense  </p>

<p>And until they and the endless other problems with the model are resolved, it&#39;s safe to say that the earth isn&#39;t flat.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>there&#39;s also things on spinning sphere earth that don&#39;t make sense.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like what?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Traveling with or against rotation comes to mind  </p>

<p>What about that? As I have already said, the atmosphere spins along with the earth. That doesn&#39;t really have an effect until you leave the atmosphere. Rockets launched into space do actually have to account for this, and launching eastward gives them a speed boost.    </p>

<p>Yeah, as picked up by a seismometer. We are talking vibrations so tiny you need extremely sensitive equipment to detect it. I really don&#39;t know what you think that is supposed to mean. There is even an explanation in your own link. You do realize by somehow using that as evidence you concede that the moon landings happen, right? Those seismometers were set up by astronauts, and the impact that caused them was the lunar descent module slamming into the moon.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has been speculated by people such as Isaac Asimov that the moon is unique in that it is unusually large for a satellite of earth.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is large, but there is at least one far more extreme example that I can think of off the top of my head. The moon is about 80x smaller than the earth in terms of mass. Pluto&#39;s moon Charon is about 8x smaller than Pluto in terms of mass. That&#39;s a 10 fold increase. The size of the orbiting objects really doesn&#39;t matter. They can be the exact same size and mass and be in orbit around each other.     </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to do it perfectly because the variation is relatively small over what you can realistically do. If you are interested, the equation for the change in acceleration do to gravity is g(h) = g * [r/(h + r)]<sup>2,</sup> where g(h) is your new gravitational acceleration, g is the acceleration due to gravity at sea level (about 9.81m/s<sup>2</sup> ), r is the radius of the earth (in m), and h is your altitude. If you get a decent scale you can probably test it yourself on an airplane.  </p>

<p>The centrifugal force of the earth&#39;s rotation also has an effect, so you would have to make sure you are at the same latitude as well.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiehallion_experiment">The gravitational attraction from mountains has also been measured going back a long time.

<blockquote>

<p>If you heat up a metal, it loses its magnetic properties. Also, they used lead, which is not magnetic.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, they most definitely cannot. If it was all explained by that, the experiment would not be repeatable with the same results over and over again across different tests and yield the same constant. It would be constantly changing.  </p>

<p>The curving in small amounts of water is due to surface tension. The reason why water &quot;curves&quot; in the ocean is because it&#39;s sitting on the earth, which is round.
