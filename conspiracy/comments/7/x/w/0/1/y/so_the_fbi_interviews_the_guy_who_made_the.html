<p>Not necessarily saying this guy WAS dismissive or he decided he didn&#39;t want to get involved. There was hard evidence and the FBI could&#39;ve done something about it on their own.

<p>They already got many of them on board with the militarization of police, using Trump and the fake BLM dialectic ... “oh you’re against the paramilitary force we call the police? That means you support the black-supremacist thugs!”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like the FBI has the whereabouts on every single person that makes a YouTube comment. Also there are laws that prevent the FBI from using certain methods to try and find someone unless they get a court ordered warrant providing enough proof. Believe it or not people make a lot of threats on social media platforms in joking or serious matters, and when they looked into this it was just a single statement that was reported in Mississippi with only a username that happened to be his actual name. So even after searching regular databases they couldn&#39;t find out what state he was from or who he was. There&#39;s also a thing called free speech. It&#39;s in the constitution you can say whatever the hell you want unless it&#39;s a credible threat with enough evidence to go after, but how can you tell if it&#39;s a joke or not? </p>

<p>Nicholas and it’s variations is a common name, Cruz is a common surname. Realistically how many of these dumbass comments get made per day across the entire internet? It’s probably 1,000s.</p>

<p>And even if the FBI finds the right kid and talks to him, they know there’s jack shit they can do.</p>

<p>There’s no reason to tear down heaven and hell to find 1 commenter out of what is 100s or 1000s of similarly stupid shit that gets said online everyday when there’s no recourse even if you find him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So every comment that makes a broad violence threat every day should get a FISA warrant so they can track that person down, send an agent out, and ultimately not have any power to do anything?</p>

<p>You think there’s only 11 people with a similar name? We know for certain what his name is now. Doesn’t his handle have Macrov in it too? How the fuck is the FBI supposed to know that’s his full real name based off a single YouTube comment.</p>

<p>You are literally advocating for a fucking police state on a conspiracy sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand it’s collected, but the argument as to why that’s awful is based on the assumption that the data can and will eventually be used against us.</p>

<p>We don’t live in a police state yet, not even close. But the FBI taking information obtained by the NSA without a warrant and making stops at everyone’s house that made a threatening comment on the Internet is a good start towards precrime and the <em>complete</em> destruction of our civil liberties.</p>

<p>I mean with this logic, why stop at just this Cruz kid? I’m sure they get plenty of other threat tips and since there’s no way to know which will ultimately prove prescient why not track down every asshole online?</p>

<p>So he’s a conspiracy user that to push a specific conspiracy wants the FBI to just go full minority report, which I’m sure he’s very against in any other scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Within a minute, an FBI agent in the unit that administers the FBI’s global tip line picked up the tip, setting in motion a process that happens on average 1,300 times a day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/fbi-tip-line-receives-actionable-tips-daily">FBI Actionable Tips</a> </p>

<p>The release highlights an instance where one idiot disclosed a direct threat and included where and when it would happen. Unsurprisingly, the FBI went to that location prior to the time and was able to make an arrest.</p>

<p>Cruz made a threat with no information.</p>

<p>The FBI got the You Tube tip and conducted database searches and couldn’t locate the kid.</p>

<p>What’s more believable, the IC groomed this kid for over a year to murder 17 children? Or the vague threat got overshadowed by the 1,300 threat responses that happen every day for the FBI?</p>

<p>They didn’t not follow up on it. They interviewed the man that contacted them. If this was some secret elaborate plot why wouldn’t they kill the guy who reported the tip? No loose ends right and if they’re A-ok with plotting the murder of 17 kids, well what’s one more random bail bondsman as collateral damage? This sub points out suspicious suicides all the time. If they didn’t want their plot busted they would’ve suicided the guy making the tip and then eliminated all evidence of said tip.</p>

<p>It’s patently unbelievable that they would groom a kid to murder 17 other kids, but then leave such an obvious loose end walking around with a story to tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree on your point about invasive tech, but I actually think the fact they didn’t use illegal methods of tracking this kid down to precrime him is indicative that we don’t live in the police state we fear. At least not yet.</p>

<p>I mean in an alternate reality where the FBI tracks this kid down using our warrantless spying apparatus and puts him on a watch list or arrests him, I could see people here doing posts that we now live in a real world version of Minority Report and we now live in a police state and how unacceptable that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How would they know he was living in Florida? They couldn&#39;t get any location information. You seem to take facts known now and make it seem that a comment from YouTube can be traced quickly and easily to the person sending it. This kid wasn&#39;t even living in Miami he was living around the Fort Lauderdale area. Using a real name doesn&#39;t immediately show exactly where the person is from with an address. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other people named Nikolas Cruz in the US. There&#39;s a billion active users on YouTube as well. I mean your expecting the FBI to find and follow up on every YouTube comment that is a threat being reported to them? I&#39;d like to see that, but even if they found him they can&#39;t just arrest him to prevent him from doing an attack 5 months later. What are they gonna do charge him with a felony for making a threat and adjudicate him guilty in less than 5 months to prevent him from buying an AR-15 to carry out a mass shooting? I mean come on that&#39;s a joke. </p>

<p>Find out how many people are named Nikolas Cruz in the US, and then follow up on every single person to figure out where that single YouTube comment came from to prevent that person from carrying out an attack 5 months later. Yep makes sense! </p>

Really...I just find it funny that you think a comment on YouTube will instantly prevent a mass shooting. Dude even if agents found him what will be done? He didn&#39;t threaten to shoot up a specific school, and he could easily deny that he would do it. Also cops were always involved with him so maybe cops could have done more, but still it&#39;s not enough to lock someone up to prevent them from doing what they want. This is America.

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps, but if his point of view was that he didn&#39;t have anything to live for maybe he would find it exhilarating. News today was another tip with all kinds of info about him were given to the FBI yet they failed to follow up in Jan so the first time wasn&#39;t a big deal, but the second time should have been a huge red flag. That right there means that the FBI did fail, but if he&#39;s had 39 visits from police officers I think he&#39;s beyond that point of caring if the FBI was knocking on his door. He would have probably threatened them in some way as well after talking. </p>

<p>Also if you are saying that the dossier was the only evidence the FBI used for a FISA warrant that&#39;s laughable. FISA warrants need more than just a single piece of evidence and they need to renew it every 90 days providing evidence throughout. It&#39;s not just a bullshit way of going to a judge and saying this dossier is all we have on the trump campaign we need the warrant now since that&#39;s all we have.

    <div class="md"><p>There must be something to this, because the &quot;No, couldn&#39;t be!&quot; debunker-wannabes are out in force here. Whenever there&#39;s such adamant, coordinated pushback, you know there&#39;s something to it. </p>

<p>I mean, seriously, how obvious is this? The FBI interviews the guy who warns about the shooter to be, but not the shooter? How is that not an obvious Red Flag for everybody?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure that theory holds water. Could it be, perhaps, many people just don&#39;t believe there isn&#39;t anything more to this than a single shooter? </p>

<p>You can&#39;t have it both ways... if no one says anything it&#39;s a false flag. Too many people, it&#39;s a false flag. Just sayin&#39;</p>
