<p>I actually was in the bathroom at the 
moment and I had came back to my
classroom and I knocked on the door and
the fire alarm went off
the principal came on the speaker and
just said everyone needs to evacuate
right now so that&#39;s what we did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh okay....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as I was going down the stairs I heard a couple
shots fired everyone was freaking out
saying that it was a gun and as we were
walking the whole class together</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go on....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I actually was speaking to the suspect
Nicholas Cruz and as I was speaking to
him he seemed very I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know
what the word I want to say is but he
was trouble in middle school so I kind
of joked to him about it and said I&#39;m
surprised you weren&#39;t the one who did it
and he just gave me a huh so that&#39;s
really what happened </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait what? You were speaking with the shooter and said I&#39;m surprised you aren&#39;t the shooter? Who says that to another student while there is a shooting going on? Also wouldn&#39;t she be more like &quot;What are you doing here, I thought you got kicked out of school?&quot; NOPE</p>

<p>Then dude asks if she was scared...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>um in the moment I wasn&#39;t because there
was obviously definitely another shooter
involved </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How was she not scared when there was ANOTHER shooter at that moment shooting people?</p>

<p>EDIT: How did she know there was another shooter involved when she only knew that there was one shooting involved at that currant time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No way I would be that calm and collected. One girl says she talked to the shooter and joked with him that she thought it was him doing the shooting. She never questioned why he was there when he was 19 and expelled from the school? She also said she wasn&#39;t scared talking to him because there was another shooter.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, what do you mean circumstantial evidence? It’s eyewitness testimony. The “circumstances” are that she’s either lying or not. I’ll assume since she likely doesn’t have any reason to lie, and she’s not pushing a gun control agenda, she’s probably saying something closer to the truth than Anderson Cooper. </p>

<p>At best what you’ve decided to take as unquestionable truth is at least 2 levels (police, news media) removed from what could reasonably be called evidence. You literally just accept the story as it’s presented to you and throw out the actual evidence (ie. Multiple conflicting reports, drill scenarios) that something is amiss. </p>

<p>It’s literally the exact same thinking that always crops up in this sub after one of these events, frankly it’s boring at this point.</p>

<p>Please feel free to explain why you are perusing a conspiracy forum if you have no reason to believe there was a conspiracy here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The girl is just lying because obviously she saw the dude before or during the attack and probably talked to him about it and then she either didn&#39;t realize anything was wrong or didn&#39;t do anything about it. She can&#39;t tell the truth risk being accused of being responsible in part, or not doing enough. </p>

<p>Her smirks in the interview are known as &quot;deceivers delight&quot;. </p>

<p>She&#39;s delighting in the fact she believes she&#39;s deceiving us. </p>

<p>I also kinda got the impression maybe she was thinking that he spared her. Maybe they had a history, maybe she had a bad boy crush on him. </p>

<p>I hope she gets psychological help. I don&#39;t think most people&#39;s reaction to seeing a troubled former student, even one who was expelled, would be to think &quot;oh, danger&quot; What&#39;s known as normalcy -bias is really strong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to give a locals perspective, the high school has three operate builds, the freshman building where the shooting occurred is three stories. The other two builds are the middle school, and the arts build (band and theater). The shooter chose the only building with long interior hallways in order to corral the people for easy pick offs. My friends daughter was in the arts building and is completely devastated and mentally upside down since the shooting happened and she wasn&#39;t even in the building where people were shoot. Our HR lady&#39;s little cousin was in one of the class rooms where the teacher got shot and they had to drag the body inside just to close the door to the class. She is devastated. None of them are as calm or collected as this chick in her interview and both experienced completely different scenarios during the shooting. </p>
