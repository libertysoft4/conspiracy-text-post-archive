        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I have another Netflix recommendation for you guys. This will be the last one for a while.</p>

<p>The Keepers is an awesome microcosm of the Catholic Churches abuses. It involves the rapes and sexual assaults of many young girls done by a Catholic Priestand his associates in Baltimore. It all starts with the cold case invesrigation of the murder of a nun to keep her quiet. It shows how the Church used/still uses its influence on the police force and community in Baltimore to thwart any real investigation. </p>

<p>It is a seven episode series, but it really is worth the watch. There wasn&#39;t a slow moment in my eyes since there were a lot of people interviewed from victims, suspects, police/detectives, government employees, witnesses, basically anyone with ANY info.</p>

<p>My girlfriend actually found this show and now understands why I stay away from the Church and made it easier for me to explain how those same scenarios happened all around the US and the world (minus the murder).</p>

<p>Caution to those with past trauma, it gets real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disclaimer: am Catholic. </p>

<p>Pedophilia is a serious problem within the Church, but since Spotlight (basically a proven hoax, see non-existence of Constance Sweeney) I take these things with a grain of salt. </p>

<p>It does not appear to me that The Keepers is untrue, but it is disinfo guiding away from a intelligence / military op / pedo ring.</p>

<p>My theory: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The priest with the glasses, Maskell, was admittedly a hypnotist and administered memory-compromising drugs to the young women. Classes at Johns Hopkins, military background where he was a military chaplain IIRC. Many of the abuses happened under the guise of psychological or physical medical examination (see story of doctor who abused girls with Maskell during examinations)</p></li>
<li><p>Above guy Maskell was said to play act and dress up in sacraments in his back yard when he was a kid. This is a sign that he and his family were Satanists, as Catholics usually don&#39;t let their kids profane the sacraments and vestments in the back yard willy nilly. (Aside from betraying his charge and being a rapist). </p></li>
<li><p>Multiple ties of the cast to military intelligence, not just Maskell. Multiple accounts of the priests inviting cops and other guys to partake, then terrorizing the kids. </p></li>
<li><p>Covered up by cops in Baltimore. This is presented in the doc as &quot;Catholics protecting Catholics&quot;, but given other pedo rings and when cops/military gets involved, it&#39;s also a case of &quot;cops protecting cops&quot;. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Towards the end of the doc, when they do the reveal and this is the most glaring part that they were stupid enough to mention:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cathy is in her apartment with other people from the seminary. She tells the others present that she is going to pursue the abuse she&#39;s discovered. MASKELL AND MAGNUS burst into her apartment a few moments later. </li>
</ul>

<p>So... this was a military operation. Cathy Cesnik was being actively surveilled by people who in real time heard her comment and stormed into her house like the fucking Stasi. </p>

<p>The Keepers is not what it seems, it was clearly some kind of spook operation. </p>

<p>End disclaimer: None of this means that pedophilia is not a serious problem (see all my comments about pizzagate and disclaimer above). I just view this easily being slidden into &quot;Catholics rape kids whadya gonna do?&quot; when it really should be about some kind of MK ULTRA operation that it clearly was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way the documentary presents it is: </p>

<ul>
<li>Night before Cathy disappeared, she has friends / nuns / teachers from the Catholic school over. </li>
<li>The priest-in-training with the deep voice who loved her (interviewed extensively) said that Maskell and Magnus burst into her apartment moments after she revealed what she suspected about the abuse at Keough school to essentially shut it down. MOMENTS. </li>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>All the work is already done.  None of us are righous:</p>

<p>Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p>Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>

<p>If you rely on your self righteousness and aren&#39;t trusting full in what Jesus Chrsit&#39;s blood sacrifce did for you then you will be under God&#39;s prfect wrath:</p>

<p>Mat 7:22  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? 
Mat 7:23  And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe Satan has entered all of the modern Abrahamic institutions, and many non-Abrahamic ones, so to betray my ancestors&#39; culture in order to not really run away from Satan doesn&#39;t seem so noble. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how you can look at the world and believe that Catholic church is Satan but everyone else is whiter than snow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I agree every single institution is on lock-down by Lucifer.  He runs this world and it&#39;s institutions.  I don&#39;t identify as any denomination.  I&#39;m just a born again King James Bible believing Christian.  Salvation is simple and it comes from repentance and faith in what Jesus did for us and that&#39;s it.  Sanctification is done by conviction of the holy spirit after being saved.  The baptism that saves is in spirit not water.  Nothing wrong with being water baptized but it isn&#39;t part of salvation.</p>

<p>I just know many people who follow Catholic doctrine and they say they cannot know that hey are saved.  So if you feel that way I just pray you will repent of that (change your mind) and trust in the blood of Jesus Christ alone to save you.  Once you truly believe in his gospel (above) in your heart and that he already saved you then you will know for certain that you are saved:</p>

<p>Eph 2:8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Eph 2:9  Not of works, lest any man should boast. </p>

<p>1Jn 5:13  These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, none of this is conclusive to the point I&#39;ll tell you I&#39;m certain, but Miles Mathis amongst others did a write-up of &quot;Spotlight&quot; where he essentially shows the judge presiding over the case likely doesn&#39;t exist and is a cut out. </p>

<p>He also pokes a bunch of holes in the overall story, pointing out that Bradlee Jr. and Sr. at Washington Post have been psy-op&#39;ing the public for decades. It was recently revealed that Bradlee Sr.&#39;s wife, Sally Quinn, is a Satanist. I&#39;m putting this all in the context of &quot;Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick&quot;, mind you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know people think that, if only because they have it repeated to them so often. I think it&#39;s a distinction that makes people feel warm but isn&#39;t true. But there&#39;s no point in just going back and forth and saying yes / no.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to stop being Catholic. The other reason I felt obligated to pipe up with specifics about this is what you are doing is really common and insidious. &quot;Hey guys Catholics are the worst everyone please stop being Catholic.&quot; </p>

<p>Also while we&#39;re on the topic, Protestant churches in the States have historically taken the lead on Satanic abuse of children, and Jews historically have taken the lead on mistreating pretty much everyone who isn&#39;t Jewish. But I gotta stop being Catholic? No. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to have a thing for finger pointing.  Anyone but the poor catholics, eh?</p>

<p>All of the abrahamic religions are masked demon/ruler worship.  Pointing at the other ones for validation doesn&#39;t help.  What makes the Catholic Church slightly worse than protestantism, is that it&#39;s been a brutally enforced mind control institution for almost two thousand years, set up by caesars and other ruling families who have been brainwashing fools since the beginning of recorded history.</p>

<p>Judaism is a scourge on humanity, and its bastard children (catholicism, islam, and protestantism) aren&#39;t much better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except the Catholic Church has the oldest history of abuse, coverups and manipulation. If it wasn&#39;t selling indulgences, it was murdering dissenters. If it&#39;s not pedophiles being SYSTEMATICALLY recruited, hidden and shuffled about dioceses, its the fact that the Church is STILL complicit with covering up priests&#39; paternity cases. Over 100k children on this planet right now are not able to see their father, claim his name as their own, or receive any monetary assistance for their existence. Let&#39;s talk about the abuses against tribal people, still being de-heathenized... </p>

<p>Do you have the obligation to believe your religion is the &quot;most correct&quot; and that scandal should be minimized to prevent others from losing faith? Sure, but realize you&#39;ve been placated into that belief, through sheer psychological and spiritual manipulation. <em>In nomine Patris et fillii et Spiritus Sancti</em></p>

<p>... but don&#39;t see how participating (and defending) in a religion that not only subverts it&#39;s own, but whole countries, and the span of modern history, would be not well recieved here</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a common refrain and I consider it a manufactured talking point, I must tell you. To many people Catholicism is their culture, you sound like an SJW who doesn&#39;t understand that Christendom (the West) as it is commonly understood comes from Catholicism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You do realize you&#39;re speaking to a person who has been abused and manipulated by the Church?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As much as I am saddened to hear this, and hope your abuser faces justice in this world and the next, you do realize you aren&#39;t making a cogent point? </p>

<p>Fundamentalists and Jews and Muslims all are guilty of sexual abuse, and sexual abuse aimed at minors. You are allowed your anger, but your point isn&#39;t valid. It isn&#39;t even a point. I&#39;m sorry to have to point this out to you. </p>

<p>You are trying to pretend you don&#39;t have a chip on your shoulder against Catholics, but you do realize your argument is essentially saying any institution that had someone raped or abused by another person now has to GO AWAY FOREVER? </p>

<p>Just stahp.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or were you too arrogant to remember that duty to piety?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn&#39;t really make sense with the rest of what you said, but because so much of what you wrote seems like LARP copy pasta I&#39;ll add the following: </p>

<p>Catholics are people. They aim to be in Communion with other Catholics and their communities and the world. There are no Catholics who feel they owe it to the Church to not be angry about pedophilia. This is a fucking creepy Protestant / Atheist meme that you would know was not true if you knew any actual Catholics. </p>

<p>Stop LARPing. I admire Hitchens for his intellect and aesthetic but you do realize you are essentially repeating 2007-2011 atheist talking points that never address how Catholics actually live their lives. And it&#39;s obvious you&#39;re talking about people you don&#39;t engage with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re actually insane. Delusional. </p>

<p>The span of the Catholic Churchs reign was around 1000 years, not the span of Western Civilization, nor accounting for the East. It&#39;s not the director of civilization or cultures, it conquered and destroyed them. Whole tribes of people, devoid of life and history, for the sake of &quot;Christendom&quot;. The authenticity of Popes is often meme&#39;d by Catholics and doesn&#39;t actually exist before it became a state religion. </p>

<p>I tried joining a parish and getting involved in 2014-2015. The Church is dead, even with Francis&#39; push to be relevant or &quot;merciful&quot;. It&#39;s only the conservative, dogmatic ones that even stuck it out through the wake of the scandal and they hate Francis for being a &quot;reformer&quot;, even though he&#39;s not changing doctrine, just making happy speeches and being nice/human in public. I don&#39;t hate them for it, I just feel bad that some people can&#39;t see through their programming and live a life without thought direction. </p>

<p>How many times are you going to point towards other pedophiles, as a defense of something bigger than just the occurrence of sex abusers? The Church recruited these men into being priests. Then counseled families into remaining silent, as the offender would often stay in the same diocese, but go to a different church. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not it&#39;s only grievance. Hoarding of wealth, directing science and medicine, hoarding literacy, helping to create the economic desparity between classes, Crusades, etc was all in the past. They&#39;re currently manipulating 3rd world countries. And elderly Americans. </p>

<p>As for your LARP, SJW, buzzwords bullshit, it&#39;s a lovely defense wall, huh? What a wonderful way to be dismissive. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t just a pedophile that got me. It was the whole diocese, complicit with the state. When a religion can pressure the state into illegal and immoral activities, is that ANYTHING near the Gospel? Is that an act of faith, or a corporate fraud? You bet your ass I have a chip on my shoulder. I have &quot;forgiven&quot; my abuser and don&#39;t believe in hell. That&#39;s not my beef. He was just as manipulated by the system as my family was. My beef is a tax-free institution manipulating the courts to protect itself from financial losses, while preaching at me the value of my humanity that it didn&#39;t value enough to even give a name. The sins of the father are literally my inheritance. </p>

<p>Seriously, you post paragraphs in defense (and try to defraud people in both subs that the intelligence community is more at fault) of an organization that practiced espionage as , dare I say, a religion. </p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>All the work is already done.  None of us are righous:</p>

<p>Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p>Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>

<p>If you rely on your self righteousness and aren&#39;t trusting full in what Jesus Chrsit&#39;s blood sacrifce did for you then you will be under God&#39;s prfect wrath:</p>

<p>Mat 7:22  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? 
Mat 7:23  And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The military is a tool of the Family.  The Catholic Church is a tool of the Family.  Neither of them are clean.</p>

<p>Just like in the military, the stupid brainwashed grunts (in the church) don&#39;t tend to have a clue what they&#39;re a part of.  It&#39;s the leadership that sets the direction.  And the catholic church is a vile institution.  Always has been.  The other abrahamic religions are awful too, but the institution of the catholic church has been a plague on the world for almost two millennia.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that military elements could be involved too, but trying to whitewash the church&#39;s role in it isn&#39;t acceptable either.</p>
