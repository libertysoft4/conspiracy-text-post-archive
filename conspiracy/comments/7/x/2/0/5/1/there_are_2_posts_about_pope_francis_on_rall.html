<p>Take it home, think about it. Most people want other people to have a fair shake at life. It isn&#39;t a big deal. But your appropriation of causes that have nothing to do with your situation is, at best, tacky. To me personally, it is highly offensive when I give a shit to think about it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re an obvious christian cheerleader. I have one female saying if I don&#39;t believe her jew had magical powers I&#39;d go to hell. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tens of millions of articles, a few holy books and the general agreement of 3 and a half billion people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means absolutely nothing by the way. Nor do articles written by these people. Everyone alive today was born in the 1900&#39;s. So basically they are theorizing over a piece of literature written to control the masses by believing in a &quot;God&quot; that was also changed from it&#39;s previous version.</p>

<p>Which is the also Jewish God. The Christians tried to steal God by proclaiming the Jew God had a son that was also himself. </p>

<p>You see, you believe in Christ which means your logic and reasoning skills are subpar. It is the same God.</p>

<p>Jews believe they are the chosen, meant to rule over all others because Abraham was a Jew who got the commandments.
Christians tried to steal God from the Jews. 
Muslims believe they are apart of it too. </p>

<p>All the same &quot;God&quot; the all knowing - all creator of the verses.</p>

<p>Keep trying to pretend that your magical bullshit is nothing more than identity politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus stated that he was the Messiah sent by God to the Jewish people.  The Jews said no, we reject you.  That means they reject his teachings which mean they think Jesus is a false prophet.  This by and large means they don&#39;t believe in God as described by Jesus.</p>

<p>Some people had faith and believed in Jesus&#39; teachings and the miracles he performed.  They became his followers.  That is how Christianity was formed (literally means followers of Christ).  </p>

<p>Muslims also deny that Christ is the son of God.  They say he was a prophet but nothing more.  A few hundred years later a bloodthirsty warleader was born who claimed to be a prophet gained tens of thousands of followers, likely by slaying anyone he invaded who didn&#39;t bend the knee to his version of God (Obviously I&#39;m biased so I&#39;ve explained it with a negative, but honest connotation).</p>

<p>Man I shouldn&#39;t have to break it down this much but I guess I shouldn&#39;t expect much more from an Antifa member.  I&#39;m literally explaining this to you while I&#39;m stoned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being the same God* (you have to be religious to get this far into any reasoning here.) Is what the believers believe. Whether they each believe it&#39;s the same is different. Jew God is the og God. Christian worship a good they believe to be the Jew God *see old testament. Muslims believe the old testament as well.   Jesus and Mohammed are profits of  the jewgod. And have their own new set of rules for the god. But it&#39;s the same God they are worshiping just people keep saying he changed his.mind.    </p>

<p>I know this is sloppy. I&#39;m on a phone but I thought this was interesting conversation.  I&#39;m with out on not wanting to agree with antifa but when it comes down to it, it sounds like you are saying they are different gods bc the followers don&#39;t want to admit they are all praying to the same guy and just bestowing thier own believes onto him </p>

<p>This is my opinion. I don&#39;t believe so I can make a statement about any of this being fact as I believe it to all be superstition.</p>
