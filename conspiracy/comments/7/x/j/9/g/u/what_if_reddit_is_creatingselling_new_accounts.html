It got me thinking, if people are buying older, high karma accounts for shilling use, what&#39;s to stop reddit from creating new accounts to sell, then editing the age/karma values (and creating a false posting history) for these accounts? It would be a more effective execution of an established tactic, allowing for rapid creation of shill accounts, limiting the exposure of the practice (since you wouldn&#39;t need to ask anybody to buy their account), and possibly be cheaper. </p>

<p>Edit: sell not sale, bah</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I just don’t see the ROI on that. The average user doesn’t jump right to someone’s profile and check karma/account age.</p>

<p>It’d just be a waste of money. If there’s any type of shill scam going on why wouldn’t they just recycle a large number of accounts through each new “shill” they bring in.</p>

<p>I think assuming there’s a black market  influential reddit account scheme going on is being kind of paranoid.</p>

Sometimes it&#39;s dismissive from the start, but more often they start off posting decent comments (I assume so people begin to mentally attribute the user as a good poster) and then after a few weeks they start with the disinfo and divisive shit.<br/>
The disinfo agent is obvious to those who know what one looks like... But unfortunately most people don&#39;t. You can&#39;t call them a shill because of rule 10. You can&#39;t call them out as a new poster because their account says they&#39;ve been around a few years. Just gotta make mental note and counter their shit as well as you can when you spot it. </p>

<p>Account age on fucking Reddit is trivial</p>

<p>For those in the know, yes. But even so, you can more quickly spot shills/spammers with young age or karma accounts. A bit harder when it is more established. </p>

<p>And just because you think age is trivial, doesn&#39;t mean others don&#39;t. Just think of job seniority, especially in unions? You could have someone half as capable as you, but your senior, and they&#39;ll have more benefits (and possibly pay) than you.  </p>
