<p>Not necessarily, no. I&#39;ve been here long enough and have talked to enough people to know, that, we have many Marxist normies here as of late, who would downvote how Ron Paul was cheated. It certainly wouldn&#39;t be conservatives or Libertarians downvoting it, now would it? </p>

<p>I&#39;m a Voluntaryist these days, but, voted for Ron Paul when he ran. I think he was exactly the person we needed to truly downsize the federal government, and return power back to the States and then ultimately, we the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed it too, but it&#39;s coming from polar opposites and all you seem to do is turn up the volume.  This has no longer become a bastion for free thinking, and you have taken a stance on one side of the hill doomed to cave in on itself by throwing around horse shit terms like, &quot;normie&quot;, and &quot;marxist&quot;.  It simply invites dispute, and turns away people that might have a place in r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>On topic, Ron Paul has been a check valve allowed to stay in power, because people are much less resistant to take action if they believe in their heart someone out there is speaking for them.  Rest assured, Ron has no power, is going no where, and will do nothing to stop the tidal wave of liquid shit being dumped on the average american.  He is required by design.  Stay comfortable enough to do nothing.</p>

Then Zerohedge (it started with the Gatestone Institute articles, recently they even had an article promoting the fear porn of &quot;automation&quot; and blaming &quot;late capitalism&quot; instead of socialism for unemployment).</p>

<p>Today I saw an article from the Mises Institute railing against the individual liberty and natural rights of children, by defending male genital mutilation in the name of a judeophiliac &quot;freedom of religion&quot;.</p>

<p>A lot of people are being sucked in ;( </p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult to believe those outlets may have been controlled opposition from the start, and are now operating their turn-around. But that may be the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By male genital mutilation I meant circumcision. It is child abuse, especially because it causes acute pain and because there are thousands of botched circumcisions every year that lead to handicapped or grotesquely disfigured sexual organs. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not even mentionning the &quot;mohels&quot; that put the infants&#39; penises in their mouth to suck the blood out. <a href="https://m.imgur.com/gallery/f3ucS09">Talk about barbarism.</a></p>

<p>About the &quot;transgender&quot; stuff, and abusing children by forcing &quot;sex change&quot; unto them, it is so absurd <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">I feel no need</a> to really falsify it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say this: I love women so much (indeed I am a <em>philo</em>gyne) that I choose to selectively grant that appellation; a hairy dude typically doesn&#39;t qualify in my opinion. How can you love someone or something that is indistinguishable from the rest?</p>

<p>To be fair, socialism is in fact &quot;late stage capitalism.&quot;  However, it would be a terrible mistake to miss the fact that it is socialism that is rotting out the heart of our society, while capitalism is what built it (and keeps it strong even with so much rot).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism is a Marxist word, so I generally avoid it, because of its ambiguity. If the banker who bribes government to get a license to counterfeit money is a capitalist, then I agree that leads to socialism, as it <em>is</em> socialism.</p>

<p>And indeed, if a &quot;capitalist&quot; country has a centrally-planned economy, ubiquitous corporate welfare, lobbyists in every corner of government, a plethoric military-industrial complex, negative interest rates, more regulation than anywhere in the world, the most undecipherable laws in human history, and is ruled in secrecy by an unaccountable oligarchy, then &quot;capitalism&quot; is bad. But then it has nothing to do with economic freedom.</p>

<p>But I’ll agree with you on this: liberty leads to prosperity, prosperity produces complacency, and complacency causes tyranny. I’m not sure how to avoid this vicious cycle. Perhaps strong spiritual grounding, and placing <em>morality</em> always ahead of <em>utility</em>?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure how to avoid this vicious cycle. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So to me, the best answer I have found is to break the scale of the cycle down into the smallest possible components.  So instead of nationwide cycles, it&#39;s more localized.  Say state, or even city-wide at maximum.  This reduces the potential scope of damage, and makes it easier to recover because (presumably) your neighbors are at a different point in the cycle when you are in the dumps.</p>

<p>This specifically is why I am an anarchist/voluntaryist.  I believe the answer to this problem is to break the units of government into the smallest possible pieces.  Ensure peace through universal armament <em>a la</em> Marx or the US 2nd Amendment.  Ensure justice with a combination of vuluntaryist courts and social insurance like the Xeer system.</p>

<p>None of this practical or realistic at this point in human history, but it is the future I feel we should be working towards.  Or at least, the future <strong>I</strong> should be working towards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wholly agree with you on the decentralization of power! Another word to describe it is <em>panarchism</em>. The end-goal of civilization is self-government, i.e. sovereign individuals.

    <div class="md"><p>Cool!</p>

<p>I feel like the only way to achieve internal monarchy is to give people room to expand their self-empowerment.</p>

<p>For example, a baby is born with the bare basics of neural function, unmyelinated throughout, nothing coordinated, primary sense is probably pain but unrefined.  Then, the baby through use and growth, puts all the connections together, myelinates the nerves, and becomes a functioning human being.</p>

<p>I feel that are similar in philosophical frames as well.  Give people room to grow their personal philosophy to include the right of lethal force, and they will expand their functioning to include it.  But people will never grow into that power unless they have access to it: they are otherwise permanently stunted.</p>

<p>It&#39;s dangerous and it takes growth.  You can&#39;t just give a child a gun.  You start with pocket knives, teach them about safety with small things, and it becomes a process of growth.  But the growth needs to happen, and it needs to with access to actual power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to follow-up, it made me think of this. Liberty and responsibility are reflections of the same underlying notion, projected from 2 different angles. Or, liberty and responsibility are two sides of the same coin; if you are infinitely free you are also infinitely responsible; conversely a slave is responsible for nothing, as he doesn’t decide anything.</p>

<p>So you can never be free if you can’t be responsible; and an ultimate form of responsibility is handling a firearm, as that has the potential of robbing a fellow human’s life from him.</p>

<p>I was in India once, asking my driver why he’d throw his plastic bottle out of the window <em>right after</em> he had lamented how dirty his country was. He seemed baffled by the question. He told me, as if it was utterly obvious, he wasn’t the one “responsible for making the streets clean.”</p>

<p>It dawned on me as that point that the century-old caste system had deprived many people over there of any sense of personal/civic/individual responsibility, as they’d never been free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a lot of &quot;left-leaning&quot; people (at least before this election), they agreed with his strong and blunt anti-interventionist, anti-war stance at a time when almost all of the politicians of both parties were advocating increased foreign intervention and militarism, but at the same time, disagreed with his stance on cutting social welfare programs and overall reducing the scope of government. </p>

<p>For a lot of &quot;right-leaning&quot; people, they agreed with his stance on reducing welfare, cutting taxes, and legalizing cannabis, but disagreed with his reducing the military, and many generally want government to do a lot of things that Paul didn&#39;t think it should do. </p>

<p>If you look at the <a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org/uselection2016">Political Compass</a> for the 2016 election (I have a <em>lot</em> of issues with the PC, but the overall diagram is useful), Ron Paul would be even farther down on the lower right than Gary Johnson. On the positions he does hold, he&#39;s very passionate, genuine, and articulate, and that resonates with people. But he&#39;s so far out of the US Overton window that most people in the US have some things they completely disagree with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, I think the media is in large part to blame for that, and as far as I remember about Paul, he also personally believed that the States <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be providing the same level of services that the federal government had been, but that the Constitution left that decision to the States, and as a Congressman or President he would do nothing to stop the States from doing so. </p>

<p>Either way, eliminating a lot of these programs at a federal level, especially if he did it over a short period of time like 4 years, would have meant that many or perhaps most States would be without these services, at least for some time. People who think government should provide the services he wanted to cut at the federal level would never have supported him. </p>

<p><em>The judges who made this unfortunate ruling simply do not understand the First amendment. It does not bar religious expression in public settings or anywhere else. In fact, it expressly prohibits federal interference in the free expression of religion. Far from mandating strict secularism in schools, *</em>it instead bars the federal government from prohibiting the pledge of allegiance, school prayer, or any other religious expression.** The politicians and judges pushing the removal of religion from public life are violating the First amendment, not upholding it.*</p>

<p><strong>It’s important to recognize that the First amendment applies only to Congress. Remember, the first sentence starts with &quot;Congress shall make no law...&quot; **This means that matters of religious freedom and expression should be decided by the states, with disputes settled in state courts.</strong> The First amendment acts as a simple check on federal power, ensuring that the federal government has no jurisdiction or authority whatsoever over religious issues. The phony &quot;incorporation&quot; doctrine, dreamed up by activist judges to pervert the plain meaning of the Constitution, was used once again by a federal court to assume jurisdiction over a case that constitutionally was none of its business.**</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Similarly, the mythical separation of church and state doctrine has no historical or constitutional basis.</strong> Neither the language of the Constitution itself nor the legislative history reveals any mention of such separation. In fact, the authors of the First amendment- Fisher Ames and Elbridge Gerry- and the rest of the founders routinely referred to &quot;Almighty God&quot; in their writings, including the Declaration of Independence. It is only in the last 50 years that federal courts have perverted the meaning of the amendment and sought to unlawfully restrict religious expression. We cannot continue to permit our Constitution and our rich religious institutions to be degraded by profound misinterpretations of the Bill of Rights.*</li>

Every single moment of media coverage about Trump throughout the primary elections was downplaying his chances of being a serious candidate. Fox, along with the rest of MSM wanted an establishment candidate like Cruz, Rubio or Jeb to face off against Hillary. Saying that corporate media ever promoted Trump is flagrant horse shit. Can you produce even one example of MSM promoting Trump? It didn&#39;t happen.

<blockquote>
<p>he garnered massive support for throughout the entire United States of America</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t true. In 2008, his polling numbers peaked in the <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/2008_republican_presidential_nomination-2741.html#polls">upper-single digits</a>; in 2012, his polling numbers never reached above the <a href="https://realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/republican_presidential_nomination-1452.html">upper teens</a>.</p>

<p>Certainly, he garnered a significant amount of momentum, and developed a passionate following among certain younger voters. But it&#39;s a bit of a stretch to say he had &quot;massive support,&quot; especially since (in both years) GOP voters were generally happy with the Republican establishment (unlike in 2016).</p>

During the primaries I don&#39;t remember seeing anything positive in MSM, even from right-leaning news sources who were hyping Cruz and Rubio. Only smaller sources and a few pundits had anything good to say about him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re off your rocker if you think they &quot;willingly gave us Trump&quot;. The media has been nothing but negative press about him since he said he was running. Read the first chapter of Art of the Deal where Trump specifically lays out how to use the media to your advantage to by saying controversial things in order to get free press. Ron Paul was blackouted by the media, Trump simply outplayed them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed it too, but it&#39;s coming from polar opposites and all you seem to do is turn up the volume.  This has no longer become a bastion for free thinking, and you have taken a stance on one side of the hill doomed to cave in on itself by throwing around horse shit terms like, &quot;normie&quot;, and &quot;marxist&quot;.  It simply invites dispute, and turns away people that might have a place in r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>On topic, Ron Paul has been a check valve allowed to stay in power, because people are much less resistant to take action if they believe in their heart someone out there is speaking for them.  Rest assured, Ron has no power, is going no where, and will do nothing to stop the tidal wave of liquid shit being dumped on the average american.  He is required by design.  Stay comfortable enough to do nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism is a Marxist word, so I generally avoid it, because of its ambiguity. If the banker who bribes government to get a license to counterfeit money is a capitalist, then I agree that leads to socialism, as it <em>is</em> socialism.</p>

<p>And indeed, if a &quot;capitalist&quot; country has a centrally-planned economy, ubiquitous corporate welfare, lobbyists in every corner of government, a plethoric military-industrial complex, negative interest rates, more regulation than anywhere in the world, the most undecipherable laws in human history, and is ruled in secrecy by an unaccountable oligarchy, then &quot;capitalism&quot; is bad. But then it has nothing to do with economic freedom.</p>

<p>But I’ll agree with you on this: liberty leads to prosperity, prosperity produces complacency, and complacency causes tyranny. I’m not sure how to avoid this vicious cycle. Perhaps strong spiritual grounding, and placing <em>morality</em> always ahead of <em>utility</em>?</p>

<p>Or, liberty and responsibility are two sides of the same coin</p>

<p>Do you watch Jordan Peterson at all?  He makes a similar argument, that &quot;rights&quot; are <em>responsibilities.</em>  Very interesting man, if you haven&#39;t run across him yet.  </p>

<p>My first thought on reading this is the horror at how often I&#39;ve heard the same sentiment right here in America.  </p>

<p>Good talking with you.</p>
