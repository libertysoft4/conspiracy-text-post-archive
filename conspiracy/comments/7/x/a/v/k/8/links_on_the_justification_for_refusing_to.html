<blockquote>
<p>In testimony in front of the Senate in March, Holder, who is now the U.S. attorney general, seemed to lament the position government enforcers had found themselves in [when deciding whether to prosecute bankers for the 2008 financial crisis]. “I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if we do prosecute — if we do bring a criminal charge — it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.” - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Holder returned to the law firm that he was at prior to becoming attorney general, where his client list included the banks that he declined to prosecute. <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/eric-holder-wall-street-double-agent-comes-in-from-the-cold-20150708">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/eric-holder-wall-street-double-agent-comes-in-from-the-cold-20150708</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be clear, the decision of whether to indict a corporation, defer prosecution, or decline altogether is not one that I, or anyone in the Criminal Division, take lightly.  We are frequently on the receiving end of presentations from defense counsel, CEOs, and economists who argue that the collateral consequences of an indictment would be devastating for their client.  In my conference room, over the years, I have heard sober predictions that a company or bank might fail if we indict, that innocent employees could lose their jobs, that entire industries may be affected, and even that global markets will feel the effects.  Sometimes – though, let me stress, not always – these presentations are compelling.  In reaching every charging decision, we must take into account the effect of an indictment on innocent employees and shareholders, just as we must take into account the nature of the crimes committed and the pervasiveness of the misconduct.  I personally feel that it’s my duty to consider whether individual employees with no responsibility for, or knowledge of, misconduct committed by others in the same company are going to lose their livelihood if we indict the corporation.  In large multi-national companies, the jobs of tens of thousands of employees can be at stake.  And, in some cases, the health of an industry or the markets are a real factor.  Those are the kinds of considerations in white collar crime cases that literally keep me up at night, and which must play a role in responsible enforcement. - <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-lanny-breuer-speaks-new-york-city-bar-association">http://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-lanny-breuer-speaks-new-york-city-bar-association</a></p>

<p>Drug cartel money laundering:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Criminal proceedings were brought against Wachovia, though not against any individual, but the case never came to court. In March 2010, Wachovia settled the biggest action brought under the US bank secrecy act, through the US district court in Miami. Now that the year&#39;s &quot;deferred prosecution&quot; has expired, the bank is in effect in the clear. It paid federal authorities $110m in forfeiture, for allowing transactions later proved to be connected to drug smuggling, and incurred a $50m fine for failing to monitor cash used to ship 22 tons of cocaine.</p>

<p>More shocking, and more important, the bank was sanctioned for failing to apply the proper anti-laundering strictures to the transfer of $378.4bn – a sum equivalent to one-third of Mexico&#39;s gross national product – into dollar accounts from so-called casas de cambio (CDCs) in Mexico, currency exchange houses with which the bank did business.</p>

<p>&quot;Wachovia&#39;s blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations,&quot; said Jeffrey Sloman, the federal prosecutor. Yet the total fine was less than 2% of the bank&#39;s $12.3bn profit for 2009. On 24 March 2010, Wells Fargo stock traded at $30.86 – up 1% on the week of the court settlement.</p>

<p>The conclusion to the case was only the tip of an iceberg, demonstrating the role of the &quot;legal&quot; banking sector in swilling hundreds of billions of dollars – the blood money from the murderous drug trade in Mexico and other places in the world – around their global operations, now bailed out by the taxpayer. - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs</a></p>

<p>NEW YORK — British banking giant HSBC agreed to pay a record $1.92 billion settlement Tuesday after a broad investigation by U.S. federal and state authorities found the bank violated federal laws by laundering money from Mexican drug trafficking and processing banned transactions on behalf of Iran, Libya, Sudan and Burma .</p>

<p>The settlement, a combination of forfeitures and civil penalties, shows the London-headquartered financial powerhouse for years deliberately channeled hundreds of millions of dollars of the prohibited transactions through its U.S. arm.</p>

<p>&quot;HSBC is being held accountable for stunning failures of oversight — and worse — that led the bank to permit narcotics traffickers and others to launder millions of dollars through HSBC subsidiaries, and to facilitate hundreds of millions more in transactions with sanctioned countries,&quot; said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer in announcing the largest settlement of its kind.</p>

<p>&quot;The record of dysfunction that prevailed at HSBC for many years was astonishing,&quot; said Breuer.</p>

<p>HSBC shares were up 0.5% to $51.82 in afternoon trading Tuesday. The shares also traded higher in London.</p>

<p>&quot;Obviously, $1.9 billion is a very large number, but it&#39;s very manageable&quot; without affecting HSBC&#39;s bottom line, said Ian Gordon, head of bank research for Investec Securities in London. &quot;It&#39;s clearly within market expectations.&quot; - <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/12/11/hsbc-laundering-probe/1760351/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/12/11/hsbc-laundering-probe/1760351/</a></p>

<p>Everything Is Rigged: The Biggest Price-Fixing Scandal Ever</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists of the world, believers in the hidden hands of the Rothschilds and the Masons and the Illuminati, we skeptics owe you an apology. You were right. The players may be a little different, but your basic premise is correct: The world is a rigged game. We found this out in recent months, when a series of related corruption stories spilled out of the financial sector, suggesting the world&#39;s largest banks may be fixing the prices of, well, just about everything.</p>

<p>Five of the world&#39;s largest banks have plead guilty to federal charges including manipulating the global foreign exchange market and rigging a benchmark interest rate that affects the cost of credit card, vehicle and other loans.</p>

<p>Citicorp (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Barclays (BCS) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) agreed to pay more than $5 billion for conspiring to fix the price of U.S. dollars and euros, the Justice Department said Wednesday. The main banking unit of UBS Group plead guilty to charges tied to interest-rate manipulation.</p>

<p>Washington’s probe into the alleged rigging of the $13 trillion US Treasurys market by Wall Street banks has narrowed its focus to a handful of firms — including Goldman Sachs, The Post has learned.</p>

<p>In addition, European authorities have opened their own investigation into possible Treasurys bid-rigging, sources said.</p>

<p>Investigators in the fraud division of the Justice Department have obtained chats and emails from Goldman that appear to implicate the company in manipulating the price of Treasury bonds, according to two sources familiar with the investigation.</p>
