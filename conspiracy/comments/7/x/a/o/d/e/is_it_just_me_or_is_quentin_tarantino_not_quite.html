        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Samantha Geimer on QT&#39;s words about her being a victim in the Polanski thing- <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/2018/02/roman-polanski-rape-victim-samantha-geimer-quentin-tarantino-me-too-1201927148/">&quot;He is sincere in his apology and I told him I felt my rape was being used to attack him by people who don’t care about what happened to me, and that I do take offense to.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Diane Kruger on QT choking her in Inglorious Basterdz- <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Be29JD3lzCC/?utm_source=ig_embed">&quot;For the record however, I would like to say that my work experience with Quentin Tarantino was pure joy. He treated me with utter respect and never abused his power or forced me to do anything I wasn’t comfortable with. With love, D xoxo&quot;</a></p>

<p>Uma Thurman on the KillBill car crash- <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Be0x6OCFRwQ/?utm_source=ig_embed">&quot;the circumstances of this event were negligent to the point of criminality.
i do not believe though with malicious intent.
Quentin Tarantino, was deeply regretful and remains remorseful about this sorry event, and gave me the footage years later so i could expose it and let it see the light of day, regardless of it most likely being an event for which justice will never be possible.
he also did so with full knowledge it could cause him personal harm, and i am proud of him for doing the right thing and for his courage.&quot;</a></p>

<p>QT on choking/spitting on UT in KillBill- <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/quentin-tarantino-defends-choking-and-spitting-on-uma-thurman-during-filming-2018-2">&quot;Naturally, I did it, Who else should do it? A grip? One, I didn’t trust actor Michael Madsen because, I don’t know where the spit’s going to go, if Michael Madsen does it. I talked to Uma and I said, look. I’ve got to kind of commit to doing this to you.&quot;
Tarantino said they tried to use fake spit, but it didn&#39;t look real enough. 
As to the choking, Tarantino said the way the scene was shot was actually Thurman&#39;s idea.
&quot;I was assuming that when we did it, we would have maybe a pole behind Uma that the chain would be wrapped around so it wouldn’t be seen by the camera, at least for the wide shot,&quot; he said. &quot;But then it was Uma’s suggestion. To just wrap the thing around her neck, and choke her.&quot;
The Times piece didn&#39;t note whether Tarantino&#39;s tactics were Thurman&#39;s idea, or if she approved of them.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to publicly apologize to Samantha Geimer for my cavalier remarks on The Howard Stern Show speculating about her and the crime that was committed against her. Fifteen years later, I realize how wrong I was. Ms. Geimer WAS raped by Roman Polanski. When Howard brought up Polanski, I incorrectly played devil’s advocate in the debate for the sake of being provocative. I didn’t take Ms. Geimer’s feelings into consideration and for that I am truly sorry.
So, Ms. Geimer, I was ignorant, and insensitive, and above all, incorrect.
I am sorry Samantha.

    <div class="md"><p>Free speech just means the government doesn&#39;t censor you, </p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t.  Free speech means that I am free to speak my mind without being censored.  Our free speech is, in theory at least, protected <em>from</em> interference by the governments.  Corporate interests like reddit can and do censor free speech.</p>

<p>I think racism is stupid.  I will fight for the rights of racists to express themselves.  Driving all the people whose opinions fall outside of the politically correct spectrum into the shadows doesn&#39;t stop their beliefs.  If anything it radicalizes them because they are left without a forum for discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I do not.  All the pedo subs on voat that encouraged illegal activity are gone anyways, and the ones that are left are essentially pedo support groups.  Now, personally I would love to change the law so that all pedos, offending or not, were put to death, but as of now it&#39;s not illegal, so they too deserve to have a forum to speak.  That said, I&#39;ve never frequented the pedo forums, and those people would be heavily abused on the forums I do frequent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling him a scumbag is unwarranted. This literally should even be a controversy if you understand the context. It&#39;s especially idiotic to single Tarantino out for this when countless people in Hollywood have said the same thing in regards to Polanski. I don&#39;t see you calling Whoopi Golberg a scumbag for saying the same thing. </p>

<p>It should also be telling that the people who know and worked with him have come out and defended Tarantino. If he was as big of a scumbag as you seem to think, I don&#39;t think these people would continue to stand by him and issue public statements in his defense. He was also the one who helped Thurman find the footage of the Kill Bill crash since it was locked up in storage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a girl in the UK who was ganged raped by 20 different men when she was 11 year old. It went on for from what I remember 3 years. When she was 14 years old one of the men pulled up to her house and she got up willingly from her chair and got into his car and was taken somewhere to have sexual intercourse. Did she consent that time?</p>

<p>The only reason we know this is because after she died of a drug overdose at 14 year old her family read her diary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you&#39;re a piece of shit. Think its hilarious that you shortened &quot;statutory rape&quot; to &quot;statutory&quot; to make it seem like the term doesn&#39;t LITERALLY CONTAIN THE WORD RAPE. Kids under 18 (I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re American) cannot legally consent so any instance of sex with a minor is always, always rape no matter how seemingly &quot;willing&quot; I.e coerced the child is. With the added fact that the child was drugged there&#39;s literally no basis for the argument she was complicit (which would be invalid anyway), whether she&#39;s &quot;forgiven&quot; him now is completely irrelevant. If you think drugging and anally raping a 13 yo isn&#39;t that bad there&#39;s no wonder you think QT&#39;s a great guy, the morality bar is clearly very, very, VERY low.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and as I said in my first post, the fact that she&#39;s forgiven him is totally irrelevant, just because one person is big enough to forgive another for a horrible action does not mean he didn&#39;t commit it. I also understand the victim does not want her traumatic experience used as a way for people with a vendetta to demonize Tarantino, but he did that himself, he said those things, if he hadn&#39;t we wouldn&#39;t be having this conversation and his morality would not be under such scrutiny. But he did, so it is. And it took 15 years and a public scandal for him to realise that defending the drugging and rape of a 13 yo was wrong and make a half-assed apology to save his own career??? Woowww, what a pillar of society. I totally get people change their views on things as time goes on but rape is generally not something people go back and fourth on the acceptability of, its always been wrong and always been illegal. I&#39;ve certainly never defended a known pedophile and rapists actions and never would for the sake of &quot;playing devil&#39;s advocate&quot; and getting attention on TV. He&#39;s trash. You&#39;re trying to make out there&#39;s some huge conspiracy to put him out of work, what exact reason would there be for that? Tarantino is one of the best loved and well respected living and working directors with a huge body of critically acclaimed work, what reason could there be for demonizing him unnecessarily? The answer is that it is not unnecessary because he has done bad things which he deserves to be criticised for, just like everyone else. There are plenty of people (like yourself) who will ignore disgusting behaviour when its done by someone they admire or that they think is a &quot;genius&quot; (Woody Allen, case and point) but that&#39;s exactly the problem, when we let people we like get away with more than those we don&#39;t, it sets up an imbalance which these &quot;genius&#39;s&quot; can easily exploit for their own gain. Keep defending him all you like but you can&#39;t deny that he has done some very suspect and morally bankrupt things throughout his career, the fact that he (might, I personally doubt it) feel bad about it now makes no difference. As a previous fan of most of his films and his general aesthetic I have no reason to demonize him other than the genuine belief that his statements were evil and deeply wrong, and the fact that he made them to gain attention and be incendiary makes it 10x worse. Why the victim doesn&#39;t want her trauma used against him when did exactly that to her for his personal promotion is totally beyond me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaa yeah I&#39;m a blue-haired sjw cuck for thinking rapes bad right?? I have not used what happened to her to attack him, ive attacked him for going on TV defending a pal who drugged and raped a 13 yo for his personal promotion and gain. If you cant see that that&#39;s wrong you clearly have major problems, but that was already clear from your previous comments about statutory rape being a &quot;lesser crime&quot;😂 If all you wanted making this thread was to circle jerk over how great he is you should have done it on a Tarantino fanpage, provided a link for you at the bottom. Sorry I made valid points that you couldn&#39;t adequately respond to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enough name throwing and finger pointing, ur not even responding to the same person talking about statutory being a lesser crime.Yes we know rape is bad, real brave stance. All QT did was say some stuff on THE HOWARD STERN SHOW 15 years ago that was intended to be provocative and to play devils advocate. He didn&#39;t gain anything from saying it. People say some of the craziest things possible on Stern, it&#39;s not worth publicly executing him imo. If it&#39;s just words then I&#39;m happy to forgive him if he properly apologizes, which he did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I want to publicly apologize to Samantha Geimer for my cavalier remarks on The Howard Stern Show speculating about her and the crime that was committed against her. Fifteen years later, I realize how wrong I was. Ms. Geimer WAS raped by Roman Polanski. When Howard brought up Polanski, I incorrectly played devil’s advocate in the debate for the sake of being provocative. I didn’t take Ms. Geimer’s feelings into consideration and for that I am truly sorry. So, Ms. Geimer, I was ignorant, and insensitive, and above all, incorrect. I am sorry Samantha.- Quentin Tarantino&quot;</p>

<p>Very first post- &quot;I am aware that my rape is being used to attack him (QT) by people who don&#39;t care about what happened to me, and I really don’t like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is sincere in his apology and I told him I felt my rape was being used to attack him by people who don’t care about what happened to me, and I do take offense to that.
I think apologies go a long way to help the person who was wronged and the person that is apologizing. I often say I don’t need them, but in truth, they always have a positive impact. He is under a lot more scrutiny than I am. If not for Roman and Quentin’s fame, nobody would be talking to me about any of this, so their words, actions and even apologies will always be glorified and criticized. Fame magnifies everything.
Talking to Quentin, I know he just wasn’t thinking and I didn’t take it personally the way he was talking on Howard Stern. But then once I saw it in writing the next day, I realized, it did make me feel better.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the first interview posted is Polanski&#39;s victim forgiving QT for that interview and for him being misinformed on that situation. The year of that interview Polanski won a best picture, QT was not the only one confused by the Polanski problem at the time.

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand there may be some error given the depth and perspective issues... there is a slight amount of foreshortening between the award and his face. Still, I just look at that skinny tiny leg and think it must belong to a child. I am a skinny guy and my leg is much larger than that... you can just tell it&#39;s not an adult leg. But I do appreciate the detective work put into that image.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s a definite smear campaign going on against him. I think it might have jumped the shark late last week when Jezebel and others wrote about a “resurfaced” interview from a Grindhouse DVD featurette where Fergie said Tarantino bit her while filming a zombie attack scene.</p>

<p>No one bothered to contact her before the story ran. The day after, she said they were just playing around and this wasn’t a legitimate story. </p>

<p>My conspiracy theory about this is Judd Apatow is behind the campaign somehow. He’s been going at Tarantino hard for months now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>3rd time that&#39;s been posted, thanks :) </p>

<p>I want to publicly apologize to Samantha Geimer for my cavalier remarks on The Howard Stern Show speculating about her and the crime that was committed against her. Fifteen years later, I realize how wrong I was. Ms. Geimer WAS raped by Roman Polanski. When Howard brought up Polanski, I incorrectly played devil’s advocate in the debate for the sake of being provocative. I didn’t take Ms. Geimer’s feelings into consideration and for that I am truly sorry.
So, Ms. Geimer, I was ignorant, and insensitive, and above all, incorrect.
I am sorry Samantha.
Quentin Tarantino</p>
