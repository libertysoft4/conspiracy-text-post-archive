<p>Also I just remembered that Flynn (a private citizen at the time) had his phone call with the Russian ambassador leaked...which basically started all of this...LEAKED...who did that? Huh. </p>

<p>....No, hardly. Especially when Erdogan has been a Gulen lackey since in office, and whenever he deviates outside of the interests of the US/Israel/Gulen, there&#39;s yet another coup attempt. Seriously, how much do you actually know about Turkish affairs? I highly encourage you to look into the alternative news sources that don&#39;t stem from US outlets like Newsweek. </p>

<p>I would like to point out that we <em>are</em> in a conspiracy sub, after all.</p>

<p>From what it sounds like to me though that was that the coup attempt was a false flag or orchestrated by Edrogan as a way to consolidate power for himself.</p>

<p>And yes, we’re in a conspiracy sub. Doesn’t meant everyone has to believe in the same theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of &quot;treason&quot; and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel&#39;s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s his full statement. I don’t know honestly, he calls accusations false, recognizes lying to the FBI was wrong.</p>

<p>“Set things right” could basically mean cooperate however he can and be truthful and forthright. If his wrong was lying to the FBI, then cooperating and being forthright would effectively “set things right”.</p>

<p>The idea that he’s flipping on Trump is still predicated on having information to flip. If that information doesn’t prove Trump colluded than it doesn’t mean what people are reading into it.</p>

<p>I’m not saying I don’t think he has info, I’m just saying it may not be what many people think it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except I don&#39;t choose based on biases, but on their reporting history. WaPo and NYT reliability spout pro-CFR, pro-war, pro-Western propaganda, not to mention their being infiltrated deeply by the intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as 100% fake news, and even those two trash heaps have some good reporting. I just choose to use sources which have integrity in reporting.</p>
