<p>no one said anything about the 2nd amendment. i didn&#39;t even give my stance on gun control. this is about how the FF idea makes no sense when there hasn&#39;t been a single step of federal action toward gun control after 98349871498 mass shootings. if they wanted to do it they&#39;ve had enough justification for years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes they can. they can easily limit it, and we have. there are bans on destructive devices. there are bans on full auto. they could reasonably ban anything down to muskets, and then go further. the 2nd amendment isn&#39;t some sort of divine device that prevents anything from ever happening. a government capable of pulling off dozens of false flag shootings should have no problem getting something passed under certain interpretations of the 2nd amendment. but we can&#39;t even get stronger background checks (which is, again, an immensely popular thing). </p>

<p>nothing&#39;s called the totalitarian tip toe. it&#39;s another thing david icke made up because he likes attention. almost every other advanced country has gun control and hasn&#39;t become a totalitarian state. but the government doesn&#39;t care about public support when they pass laws already, and they would&#39;ve had enough justification years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  I know this is a conspiracy subreddit but sometimes there isnt a conspiracy, sometimes the world just fucking sucks.</p>

<p>Whats more likely: A mentally ill teenager was bullied and isolated, so he grabbed his guns and shot his class mates and now people genuinely want gun control</p>

<p>or that the federal government orchestrated a giant undercover plot with the help of multiple news media stations, in order to maybe pass lukewarm gun legislation that no one in the entire country wants passed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re generally right, in that it&#39;s clear that people can sadly become so disillusioned or deluded and resentful that they would actively seek out to harm that which is good and alive. Columbine seems to be a genuine example of this, as far as I know.</p>

<p>I would say, however, that you&#39;re drawing a conclusion with your final sentence that isn&#39;t really warranted because you&#39;re arguing against something that nobody seriously suggested.</p>

<p>Nobody claims that &quot;the federal government&quot; is doing these things. Nobody in Congress (who isn&#39;t part of the innermost circle) would have to be aware of false flags. And there&#39;s not much you need to &quot;orchestrate&quot; when you have a profile of pretty much every individual (especially high-schoolers) anywhere, which allows you to pick out those few who are actually close to that point which the Columbine kids crossed. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re the kind of person who understands psychology enough to know how to trigger responses in people (CIA, et. al.), it&#39;s really not that difficult to conceive that events like this one might be provoked, triggered, or staged (with the predetermined &quot;culprit&quot; being no more than a patsy; mysterious second shooter and all).</p>

<p>So my point is that the fact that people can genuinely become cruel and deranged enough to shoot up a school out of their own volition doesn&#39;t take away from the idea that shadowy groups would abuse our collective emotional response to events of this sort to transform our societies in ones of ever-increasing &quot;security&quot; through control, gun or otherwise.</p>

<p>But Why ruin something for law abiding citizens when we can address the real problem. I for one think it&#39;s our culture and mental illness that leads to guns looking like a bad thing. You can do as much with a stolen semi truck can you Not? I mean confiscate all the guns that will just lead to the &quot;bad guys&quot; who have the illegal guns to be the only ones to have them. There is strict guns laws on South America, Mexico, The UK and Europe but you still have tons of people with guns that terrorize people because they know they have the gun and regular people dont. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. A lot of people know that their gun is purely for safety and the last check before a tyrannical takeover. We&#39;re not mentally disturbed people that want to hurt people unless someone poses an immediate  threat to loved ones.</p>

<p>Same argument applies to any dangerous thing. Most people won&#39;t do harm. But we still regulate things like explosives and dangerous chemicals.</p>

<p>Yet they still have very strict regulations yet still have gun deaths hmm. Also deaths by other means rose because of it. Such as acid attacks and stabbings.</p>

The difference is that the threat is localized, random, and often without warning.

The real question is what pushed this kid over the edge, and why would he be able to carry out his attack if the school, the police, and the FBI knew that he was a threat. If you think that the kids of today have anything in common with the baby boomers besides dna take a look around. Baby boomers played outside, these kids don&#39;t play. They take selfies, and snapchat.   </p>

<p>You mean like how the Baby Boomers were raised in fear of nuclear annihilation by performing endless (and unnecessary) &quot;drills&quot; where they were made to hide under their school desks? Or how they lived in fear of a compulsory draft that would send them (or their loved ones) to fight and die in a foreign land for amorphous and unjust aims?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that most school/rampage shootings are not FF or TI. I think we have a serious issue in America and it&#39;s not just access to weapons or the &quot;mentally ill&quot;. There&#39;s a sociopathic, voyeuristic narcissism to exist in this world. We&#39;re all plugged into our own entertainment, including the elderly, and remote from each other, including nuclear families that all socialize online, even when home together. </p>

<p>I watch the kids at the bus stop across the street. One dad parks with his kid in the car. The dads and moms talk. Only the 2 youngest boys are playing with each other. Kids don&#39;t even know how to socialize with their neighbors? I fuckin loved my &#39;hood friends. I had dozens. We did so many things beyond Nintendo. Rode bikes. Played sports. Made a hiking/biking trail in the woods. Had a fort. Bottle rocket wars. Snuck porn at one kid&#39;s house. Snuck cigarettes at another. Explored the creek all the way to the river.  I had social contacts, even when not at school, church or sports/dance. I also grew up without cable and a lot of network programming was aimed at pre-schoolers, so TV was a lame way to spend my time. Do kids even read books, craft, listen to music anymore, without it being an app? </p>

<p>The other thing this sub doesn&#39;t like to talk about is that the perpetrators are generally white (young) males, who are unhappy with society and spend a lot of time online. The denial is thick on this point. </p>

It was then followed by two different wars, the first of which was supported almost unanimously by both parties, the second of which attracted majority support from Democrats.</p>

<p>In Sandy Hook, a bunch of young children were mowed down. If anything was going to be a &quot;9/11&quot; for gun confiscation, <em>that</em> would&#39;ve been it. And it was followed by literally nothing serious being enacted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to take away rights and make the people themselves want it to happen in order to make them feel more secure you need time to ignite fear, build momentum and create tension. You keep repeating over and over until they can&#39;t take it. Then they&#39;ll beg you and that&#39;s where you step in as the saviour. You create the problem, most of the attacks are suspicious if not outright semi-staged or allowed to happen, and then you offer a solution. If you take such valuable rights away too quickly people will protest. But if you convince them through such events, and most importantly the media, that gun control is needed they will gladly obey and give you their guns with open arms eventually. It&#39;s like chess. You think in advance long-term and don&#39;t want to rush your moves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy here is not about gun control. It&#39;s about the fear of gun control driving people to stock-up while they can, fueling gun sales and donations to the NRA. 
I&#39;m not saying the NRA/ gun industry is orchestrating false flags, but that they have the most to gain when these tragedies occur (roughly once per fiscal quarter). 
I am curious about what (if any) ties might exist between the pharmaceutical industry and gun industry, as many of these murderers have a history of anti-depressant or anti-psychotic medication.  </p>
