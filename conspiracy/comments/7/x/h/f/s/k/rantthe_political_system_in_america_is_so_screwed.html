    <div class="md"><p>It’s human nature to horde and be greedy for self preservation reasons. It’s as hard to fight this innate reaction as it is to convince yourself that sweet fatty salty things taste worse than bitter greens.</p>

<p>However, one mechanism (although of a heavily flowed system) I can see that can help alter the innate greed is religion. To introduce a thought that there is existence and consequences after death (whether it be true or not) provides somewhat of a foil to the impulse of greed now. </p>

<p>I know plenty of bad, evil religious people that use their religion for selfish justifications. But on the other hand, the most kind, generous, and altruistic (debatable if true altruism even exists however) people I know are deeply religious.</p>

<p>The one thing I believe in, as corny as it sounds, is the only way to trump a lot of maladies in today’s society is through love and compassion, wherever the motive or source comes from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04981">Parochial altruism</a> is certainly a thing.  Some of our ancient ancestors would help each other without an immediate expectation of reciprocity.  In the long run, the people that helped each other selflessly received more help in turn than those that demanded repayment or didn&#39;t help at all, and thus were more able to survive and pass on their genes and memes.  The groups with more selfless helpers tended to outcompete the groups with fewer, and they were able to build larger communities, which led to civilizations, which led to empires.  Parochialism has ruled for tens of thousands of years.  True altruism, if it exists, doesn&#39;t stand a chance against the in-group mentality.</p>

The so called world&#39;s biggest democracy(India) isn&#39;t doing any good either with the rise of politically backed goons and nationalism rhetorics. Media has been bought to the extent that their is a dedicated new network just to push the current government propoganda and serving fodder to easily manipulated masses who treat the leader as physical incarnation of God. Only difference, freedom of speech is still guarded to an extent whereas here it&#39;s scary to talk anything bad about government in public.

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. You might think that since the potential rewards aren&#39;t as large, municipal governments wouldn&#39;t be as corrupt. It&#39;s actually the opposite since the people in office at those levels have zero spotlight on them. People barely even vote in local elections and many don&#39;t even know the candidates names. Plus, even a relatively small town can have a budget in the millions, so there are plenty opportunities to award construction contracts to your friends or companies that you totally don&#39;t secretly have a stake in.</p>

<p>He was a billionaire ceo. Chances are, he came close to fucking models, maybe not pornstars. I’m gonna need a source for that. Even if you meant models, so what. Name any guy that hasn’t lied about banging someone. And this was before he was president. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And you know this because you have his tax returns? Or are you relying on the “lie” trump said about it. You’re most likely pulling that out of your ass considering the tax return that was leaks and read on live tv showed that he paid more than his fair share. </p>

<p>After becoming president, they jacked membership fees at Mar-A-Lago from 100k to 200k and he spends 100% of his personal time away from the WH at his own properties.</p>

<p>Did you know that the mar-a-lago was once intended to be the second White House? If anything, trump is fulfilling merriweather posts dying wish and that property is now being used as a winter White House. So self serving. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s him saying he never met Putin on Jul 27, 2016. I can provide links to transcripts if you care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TRUMP: I never met Putin, I don&#39;t know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I&#39;m a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s him saying he never worked with any Russians same day, in reference to his businesses and taxes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I&#39;ll release them when the audits completed. Nobody would release when it&#39;s under -- I&#39;ve had audits for 15 or 16 years. Every year I have a routine audit. I&#39;m under audit, when the audits complete I&#39;ll release them. But zero, I mean I will tell you right now, zero, I have nothing to do with Russia, yes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please also note that audits don&#39;t prevent him from releasing his taxes, nor do audits last for years and years and years. </p>

<p>Here he vociferously denies ANY dealings with Russia</p>

<blockquote>
<p>QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) Russia has no business in you -- that you don&#39;t have any...</p>

<p>TRUMP: No, I have nothing to do with Russia, John (ph). How many times do I have say that? Are you a smart man? I have nothing to with Russia, I have nothing to do with Russia.</p>

<p>No, <strong>doing</strong> not saying. What separates them from the rest of the pack is that their <em>actions</em> matched their words. Politicians like Rand Paul, Flake, and McCain often say the right thing, but ends up doing the wrong thing when it actually matters, when it comes to their voting record. </p>

I&#39;m sure if they cast a wider net and included US Congressman we&#39;d see vastly different numbers that probably closer align to the pollee&#39;s of that Rasmussen study. Also, what constitutes a &quot;good faith&quot; to keep their campaign promises? It&#39;s also odd that they then use the back half of the article to bitch about Trump, seems kinda like a non-sequitor to me.</p>

the answer for this is not voting its not canvassing and getting the word out the fucking answer is to knock it all down and start over. this shit isn&#39;t broken our government/society/america is not broken it is a fucking mess so there is no fix. no bandaid or quick solution the only way to get us on a better track is a revolt. bloody, viloent, destructive revolution. then lock the doors to the outside and rebuild. the american dream has been long dead there is no longer the ability to start from nothing and become everything. The idea that any child in america can grow up to one day become president is a total and bull shit lie. no one can be president unless those rich mother fuckers at the top allow it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please vote for the Green Party.  Doctor Jill Stein has the foresight and the determination to cut the extraordinarily wasteful &quot;Defense&quot; budget <strong>IN HALF</strong> if she becomes President, despite the countless assassination attempts from the CIA that she would likely encounter for bravely trying to halve the &quot;Defense&quot; budget.</p>

<p>Halving the &quot;Defense&quot; budget is in her platform; she campaigned on it in 2012 and 2016.  The wildly wasteful and excessive &quot;Defense&quot; budget is America&#39;s Number One Problem.   We would have money for everything (infrastructure, education, health, new industry innovations) if we cut the &quot;War-making&quot; Budget in half.</p>

<p>The mendacious, larcenous Democrats and Republicans are actually increasing the &quot;Defense&quot; budget every year!  They don&#39;t care about the American People, only for &quot;Defense&quot; giants Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrup Grumman, the 3 Kings of America, our war-happy rulers who see their profits skyrocket with each new war.</p>

<p>Some may ask why I never include Boeing in the list.  Well, 80 percent of Boeing&#39;s annual revenues come from civilian sector sales of airplanes like the 747, 767, etc., whereas it&#39;s just the opposite for the 3 Kings:  Upwards of 80 percent of their annual revenues come from military weapons manufacturing --  way excessive, wasteful, and unnecessary weapons production at that.  So I cut Boeing just a little slack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s Defense Budget:$716 billion aproximately 13% increase from 2017</p>

<p>$617 billion: Base budget for the Defense Department</p>

<p>$69 billion: Overseas Contingency Operations (extra funding for wars that Congress can’t limit, known as OCO)
$30 billion: “Other” national defense spending, which includes money for the Energy Department to oversee America’s nuclear weapons</p>

<p>150 billion was used in 2013 for current and retired military personnel, and their benefits.</p>

<p>90 billion were used for basic pay, food, housing, allowances, bonuses  and any type of special pay.</p>

<p>16 billion were used for their pensions.</p>

<p>40 billion aproximately were used for their health benefits. [This keeps increasing each year btw] </p>

<blockquote>
<p>out of aproximately 10 million people eligible for their benefits only 1.4 million serve in active duty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump&#39;s budget aims to recruit 26,000 new troops, and build 355 ship quote -which experts say it will take decades to complete-</p>

<p>If it takes 150 billion on 1.4 million personnel. and she wants to cut it in half then 75 billion would only fund about 700k personnel. That&#39;s a big jump [BTW this was just a simple division, obviously it would be more balanced. Yet considering that Jill Stein hasn&#39;t actually released her plans, and I can&#39;t find any of her numbers, nor how she actually wants to reinvest that money on renewable jobs that those who lose the jobs will &quot;get&quot; plus the fact that she wants to make the National Guard the primary group for our defense. Makes me very skeptical of the reality of her plans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America&#39;s brave soldiers are getting very little of the 1.2 Trillion dollars in &quot;Defense&quot; we spend each year.  Totalling all soldiers&#39; annual pay amounts to only  about 35 or 40 billion dollars, which is just 3 percent of the true annual &quot;Defense&quot; budget calculated last year by Doctor Paul Craigs Roberts, who was Reagan&#39;s Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.  </p>

<p>Even if you want to use your figure of 150 Billion for total pay <em>and</em> benefits of current and retired military personnel, that amount to only 12 percent of the 1.2 Trillion.</p>

<p>The vast amount of the annual &quot;Defense&quot; budget goes to the &quot;Defense&quot; companies for weapons manufacturing to make too, too many aircraft carriers, destroyer ships, long-range bombers, fighter jets, tanks, missiles, ICBMs, hydrogen bombs, etc., etc., and crazy Star Wars/&quot;S.D.I.&quot; schemes if they attempt to resurrect that program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where do you get the 1.3 trillion of annual defense budget? I can&#39;t find a source that even comes close to that. Specially when in 2015 the annual U.S. budget was totalled in 3.3 Trillion yet the military only had  609.3 Billion (16% of all the budget) without counting Veteran&#39;s benefits and they don&#39;t even come close to the 1.3 trillion you mentioned.</p>

<p>And actually Trump increased the military pay raise by 2.4% on the monthly pay. If the average active  military sergeant salary is about 99,000 including all the benefits. When we only take actual salary that is about $29,380, divide this by 12 months and that equals around $2,448.33 per month, multiply this by the 2.4% it equals to around $58.75.  So that would mean they would earn around $2,507.08 which annually  would mean they would earn around $30,084.96 . It&#39;s not a lot but it is something.</p>

<p>When you mention the 40 million in terms of the 1.4 trillion (again I can&#39;t find any source that equates that defense budget in annual basis) You only mention actual salary, not the benefits that they get as I explained in my first response.</p>

<p>Finally, obviously most of the budget goes to operations, the military by ideology does not have time to personally develop new guns and tech. They pay companies and arm dealers for both the manufacturing and the distribution of them obviously they are going to spend more. In fact the average soldier needs around 17k to equip. That includes training and equipment. Most of the arms and technology the military uses comes from U.S. located arm dealers. So even if you disagree with this you cannot ignore the fact that it is also possible that many of these companies and therefore their works will also lose their jobs when you plan to slash the entire budge by half.</p>

<p>Again we can continue debating around individual program fundings but unless you give actual numbers with sources we cannot have a discussion of this topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do take into account benefits and salary in the 150 Billion figure you mentioned.  I&#39;m fine with the 150 figure.  </p>

<p>Last year&#39;s &quot;Defense&quot; budget was about 600 Billion plus 200 Billion in &quot;contingency&quot; expenditures.  That&#39;s 800 billion.  So total pay and benefits for active duty and retired personal is still just 18 percent of the total budget by your numbers of 150.  But google Doctor Paul Craig Roberts, who was Ronald Reagan&#39;s Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.  Doctor Roberts and others calculate last year&#39;s actual spending on &quot;Defense&quot; to be about 1.2 Trillion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve never heard of Doctor Paul Craig Roberts?  He&#39;s respected within conservative circles, and liberal ones.  I once posted a link to a YouTube video of Dr. Roberts in which he (and others) have listed 1.2 Trillion.  But even using your figure (which is our always honest government&#39;s figure) of 800 Billion last year, the 150 billion is still just 18 percent of 800 :-)</p>

<p>... thats exactly how it gets distributed? if you are working 60 hours a week at a cash register, great you provided a service (i guess), but the job is valueless. if you are doing something harder (in terms of who can do the job, not how many hrs you stand there), you get paid more</p>

<blockquote>

<p>people are mostly idiots and stay stuck in this trap because they are either too stupid or lazy (or both) to get out of it. there are more opportunities now than ever before to improve your life... hell you can make a million $ a year playing video games online from your house. my best friend went to a public state university but spent the summers doing internships and getting top grades and 4 years after graduating makes 200k+/yr even though he works 60-70 hrs a week. and the fact being in the military pays for your college...</p>

<p>if youre poor, or stuck living month to month, its almost always because the choices you made. maybe now theres less ways to escape that, but thats because you have to live with the choices you make</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your frustration, but it&#39;s hardly our fault. If you research the history of America the rich have been holding the hand of our government since it&#39;s inception hundreds of years ago.<br/>
I didn&#39;t choose when to be born, neither did you. And I for sure wouldn&#39;t have chosen to be born into this system that was already fucked and put in place.<br/>
Yes I know that we can change it. But unless we have revolts greater than what happened in the 1800&#39;s and early 1900&#39;s nothing will change (and lots of people were killed by the government for them).
Any child born in the U.S. today adopts over 20 trillion of debts, the majority of the money that created that debt was used to push our imperialism across the globe, and at the same time make a few families filthy rich.  </p>

<p>Maybe the internet can be used as a catalyst for change. Imagine if enough people online put their heads together to try to come up with a new system that benefits everyone. What would be the culmination of such power? Instead of a few people in a room out of everyone&#39;s sight coming up with how to be in charge and run everything. People could rally together to try to come up with a new way things should be run, and other people could point out flaws brought up. I don&#39;t feel qualified for this myself, but if Think Tank companies exist, then the internet itself is the closest thing we have to a global consciousness (or a brain).<br/>
How do we create a system that benefits everyone without creating poverty and despair?<br/>
Maybe the good old Problem, Reaction, Solution method that the elite are so keen on using can be used upon them as well.<br/>
And the first step is coming up with a Solution. Then we point out the Problem, and use the Reaction to introduce the change.  </p>

<p>Sorry, I went on a rant. It&#39;s not our fault personally, it&#39;s the inherent greed of mankind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The solution is simple actually 
Feed the masses, decentralized free produce that supermarkets, distributors and producers are required to provide for free, vegetables, rice, corn, milk, ect. 
Secondly a new law, no one can be evicted from their primary residence. 
And clean free transportation for all and move away from cars and put gardens where the parking lots were. 
I know your asking how will we pay for this? Simple, decrease military spending and all the money necessary will be available. 
Once people are less easily exploitable then society will balance itself out. Inequality is the result of the masses being easily exploited. Since all of us need food, shelter and transportation and we are easily exploitable if the threat of these things are taken away a society where these basic needs are provided the masses will be less exploitable and in turn the inequality we experience will be reduced. </p>

<p>I see you live in Canada and want to talk about socialized medicine. </p>

<p>Let’s do that. Let’s discuss how being allies and sharing a border with the worlds largest superpower affords you to luxury of having a virtually nonexistent military which you can then use the tax dollar savings to buy sup par healthcare. </p>

<p>Furthermore let’s discuss how Canadian price controls in the medical sector have no market basis and are subsidized by rate hikes to US citizens. </p>

<p>Let’s discuss how there are months long waiting lists for fundamental and sometime life saving procedures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sharing a border with the largest superpower is precisely why we need our small but efficient military. It may not be that large but there is a militia unit in every town and we have a high rate of gun ownership. Since you couldn&#39;t beat Vietnamese peasants or Afghan mountain men. It&#39;s enough.</p>

<p>Quality of healthcare is measured by outcomes. Ours are better than yours, and US citizens permanently residing in Canada have equal access to it.  Even North Korea which spends almost as much per capita on their military as Americans have universal health care. It has nothing to do with American subsidies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you man. I kindly dissagree though with us and Germany. Actually the US is like Germany in the 30s&amp;40  minus the holocaust ,ww2. But during the 30s and 40s Germany was a country ripe with a bright economical future after they bounced back from a horrible depression. Hell our own President had a picture of Hitler on his desk in the White House. Now, to differentiate us from Nazi global domination is that we fear global extinction. No one is fooled by proxy wars etc. Its all a game to be the most Dominant. Its in our nature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real truth is none of us would really be any different if we were in similar positions of power.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very easy to sit as an outsider and say &quot;Not me&quot;. However, in my country after the austerity imposed by the EU, we elected a large number of political outsiders. All of them went in on the &quot;we&#39;ll break corruption&quot;, &quot;we won&#39;t accept bribes&quot;. In the last 5 years all of them have been caught accepting bribes, meeting with lobbyists then backing their motions in the houses of parliament. They&#39;ve all been caught paying their families to work for them, lying on their expense claims and generally being like every other politician who&#39;s ever lived.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll never have a fair government as long as people are in control of politics. In fact, the only way I can ever see it happening is if we create an artificial intelligence who&#39;s only goal is to create monetary equality for all citizens.</p>

<p>So get used to it. It&#39;s never going to change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all started in the reconstruction Era. Mega industry leaders like Vanderbilt, Morgan, Carnegie, etc basically bought their way into complete control of industry and legislation. They eventually got pruned out around the time of the first major stock market crash but that was just a practice run. After world War 2, the defense industry was booming, they had the perfect villain to roll out, and they had people&#39;s buy in on their purpose. Thus started a 70 year plus control on legislation. In the 70s and 80s, the oil companies and big banks and pharmaceutical companies found their little slices thanks to Reaganomics. Since then, there&#39;s been an almost uninhibited run on corporate control of congress and media.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not true. They can and they are doing it in secret. They work tirelessly to ensure their plans come to fruition. The problem is you can&#39;t do it by brute force. This is what they have learned over the last two millennia. You need to do it over time. Erode people. Every step they take is designed to slowly degrade the quality of the humans in the general public with the purpose of reaching a divide so great there is only the Nobility and the Workers. They want the workers so completely oblivious to the fact this is happening that they won&#39;t even need to try and hide what they are doing. The Workers will just accept &quot;that&#39;s how it is&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elite and their bought and paid for politicians want a  return to Roman Times where the wealthy were the only &quot;free&quot; men and the rest were slaves to used as they wish.  Couple this with Advanced AI and agile robotics, they will want to eliminate most of us so they can have the Earth return to a green and blue paradise with only a few(500 million to a billion or so) of the them getting to enjoy it.  They will want to keep a small % of us for their amusements and are actively working towards this end.  </p>

<p>The degradation of the environment will be the window of chance for the masses to strike a fatal blow to the elite.  When they have to retreat to their underground cities to ride out the enirvonmental calalmity on the surface is when the masses who are left to the horrors will need to find those underground cities and destroy them.  It won&#39;t save us but it will make sure the elite go down/our with the rest of us.  </p>

<p>The USA was special but we got complacent and I fear it is not fixable due to the Citizens&#39; United ruling.  It will make it impossible to fix our system as the amount of money flowing in is too much.  </p>

<p>I just wish there weren&#39;t so many that are willing to help it all along by supporting Trump.  He is an evil stupid man who should be stoned to death, but somehow is being allowed to help bring it all down around us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your sentiments, and expect the same dark future awaiting us, given our chosen path as a nation. We are witnessing power consolidation, instead of additional checks and balances to protect the average citizen.  </p>

<p>Instead of the environment being destroyed, causing a Punisher-esque scenario in infiltrating the bunkers and cleaning house (enjoyable as that would be), I expect the US will see the continued rise of a covert neurofeedback network, that is being harnessed to cause widespread confusion among political dissidents, by manufacturing precisely targeted auditory illusions. They are turning neighbors/citizens and otherwise likely allies against each other with vile illusions that impersonate the other, leading to rifts in society where none should reasonably be.<br/>
The average citizen predictably reacts with assuptions of mental illness toward their neighbors, and are extremely resistant to consider any other source, due to dismissive portrayals in entertainment creating a stigma -- most people cannot differentiate between &quot;Saul&#39;s brother getting psychosomatic relief with mylar&quot; and the hard science of industry-proven electromagnetic shielded enclosures and rooms -- they are recklessly assumed to be the same.<br/>
There needs to be a culture shift towards accepting the efficacy of electromagnetic shielding, instead of casting it off as a hallmark of mental illness. I&#39;ve created subreddits with information intended to aid and protect those that are being targeted with such technologies, and have mustered the courage to walk past the &#39;lol tinfoil&#39; imbeciles towards a real solution that&#39;s proven to work.  </p>

<p>I caucused for Bernie in 2016, and ended up shredding my ballot because I would not vote for a red/blue-flavored oligarch. I only respect Trump for one reason -- he defeated the Clinton foundation political machine. All the clothespins in the world couldn&#39;t get me to vote for Hillary, and the DNC denying Bernie and throwing the election to Trump should never be forgiven or forgotten.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. In my view, we reached a point in history where there is a light for humanity... We have the possibility to change something, and non spiritually I think there is a change going on. Not just because of Trump or something, but behind the curtains some of the puppet masters are in fear. Short while ago, a huge asset of the Rothschild in Austria was sold. They need liquidity. Seems like the money printing out of thin air is over, they touched the hard assets and this means something. So, in 10 years retrospective we&#39;ll shake our heads and tell these storys our children and spook them with this fairytals of the evil people who created wars for wealth, created decease to treat them halfway, plant poison in food and so on and on... </p>

I knew what trump would be and that russia would control him the moment i heard of him being a candidate. when you are familliar with russian schemes 1st hand, its SO OBVIOUS.Even my prime minister is also an &quot;anti-regime&quot; &quot;successful businessman&quot; &quot;white male&quot; &quot;family man&quot;, who also happens to have &quot;shady ties to russia&quot; and his laws have nothing to do with the well-being of the people of my country. Rings a bell?</p>

<p>Anyway, I never expected any deep thinking from a trump voter anyway, else they wouldnt be trump voters, right?

<p>Do I think Russians meddled in our election? Yes, it’s very possible. And we have clear evidence of that with uranium one. I’m willing to bet uranium one is just fake news to you right? Yet you sit there peddling trump Russia with not much to go on. How’s the mueller investigation going?</p>

As I said, I have lived my entire life in an eastern post-soviet country, with a clear, but officially hidden, just like in the US now, Russian presence in our government. Trump is a classic Russian patsy, as I said, just like our current prime minister, we had a president like this, and many more high profile polititians.

<p>Uranium one covers Clinton. Yet you can’t provide anything that covers trump. Mass orgies?! Bringing up the democratic opposition research known as the dossier where money exchanged many hands, including Russians, to prove trump can be blackmailed shows the level of brainwashing you’ve gone through.

    <div class="md"><p>Look, politics is a game. A game that has been being played before America was founded, and will continue when America is gone.</p>

<p>Once you understand this it’s very easy to just stop paying attention. The politicians are never gonna let the game end, this is key in allowing yourself to not give a fuck about politics. </p>

<p>People say if you stop paying attention the politicians will go crazy with power and ultimately fuck the average American but aren’t we basically already at that point? Politicians are being held to such low standards that morals and values are a thing of the past. </p>

<p>The politicians are only gonna allow the spectrum to swing so far before they switch the direction of the pendulum, they’re never going to allow the pendulum to stop. </p>

<p>So, once we understand the ultimate goal of a politician is to make sure politics don’t die, we realize that the issues the politicians are spewing aren’t going to be the end of the world. Even tho they have the power of law, they will not let that power destroy their game, and as long as the game is played they get paid.  Which is why you see certain politicians being outted, not because they’re harassing interns/any woman they please, because they’re a determent to the game they’re playing.  </p>

<p>Once I realized this it was very easy for me to not give a fuck about what they say or do cause it’s all going to stay within the parameters of the game. And this game is cooperation v government. 
Imo it’s easiest to just not focus on politics but be aware of bills and laws being passed, hit the local parties so at least you have a strong bond with your local community, but wording yourself about politics as a whole is a waste of time imo. </p>

<p>Facts don&#39;t matter anymore. Truth is based on how you feel about an issue. No one respects data, or science, or reality. Its my team vs your team. There still people who believe Obama was a godsend and fixed everything, and still people who believe Trump is honest and not a completely self-absorbed narcissist f****** this country for his own benefit.</p>

<p>Journalism was a tool of the people who don&#39;t have time to investigate every issue. The Common working man does not have time to analyze all the data necessary to find the truth about our elected representatives. With faith and journalism at all-time lows, I don&#39;t see how we can ever recover from this. The elites will continue robbing us until we reach the point of bloody revolt</p>

<p>that was the smartest thing you said.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>when it comes to politics, you have to realize all media has a bias. People are just starting to realize the CNNs of the world arent news, they are mind control machines, leftist propaganda, no different than PRAVDA or TASS.</p>

<p>Your comment about Trump is a perfect example.  WHY do you think he is f*ing the country for his own benefit? WHAT benefit? He was already a 70 year old billionaire and TV show star. Taking on the thankless job of having media attack him with daily smears was a step DOWN in so many ways...but the media wont tell you that...so people like you dont realize that you subsconsciously have been trained to hate him. Wont argue the narcissism though, any person with his history is likely to have an exaggerated sense of self-importance, and it is historically his hallmark trait - but notice how you have been conditioned to apply that as confirmation bias to your disdain for him.</p>

<p>Back to the OP post - I think we can recover if:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>everyone realizes that ALL media is propaganda on some level, and a lazy and effortless view of &quot;news&quot;, or even entertainment in general, and you will be silently programmed whether you like it or not. Be AWARE in consumption of all media, assess underlying motives, facts, and evidences with an open mind and a true sense of the bias of the publisher/broadcaster.</p></li>
<li><p>agree with some comments about taking the money out of politics. Not sure the best route to achieve it, but essential. The profit motives corrupt everything hopelessly.  There are some situations where a profit motive cannot be attached to the process. Like the criminal justice system. Like the military and national defense. And like politics in general. </p></li>

<p><strong>HE</strong> isnt. His business is an entity that existed before the presidency and will exist after. He may return to running it after he leaves the WH in 7 years. Whats your point?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why didn&#39;t he put it all in a blind trust?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that a requirement under law? If not, then why would he?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did he promote ivanka&#39;s businesses from his position as president?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Define &quot;promote&quot;. If you mean mention that she has great stuff and people should buy it, maybe because he is a human being he is allowed to do that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did the state department promote Trump properties?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, define &quot;promote&quot; and include sources, and I will review and give you my thoughts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why does he spend 100% of his time away from the White House at Trump properties?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont know, and Im not sure that is an accurate statistic. Do you have a statistical reference for that which can confirm his 100%? If not, is there a % that you feel it is up to you, your highness, to allow him?  Because clearly it is your job to decide on that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are 3/4 of his golf trips to his own Golf Resorts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No idea, and why does it matter in any sane universe?</p>

<p>I know Trump hate is irrational, and the media has literally created an army of you blind haters with its 24/7 drip feed, but get ahold of yourself. You are literally turning the most mundane issues into attack points.</p>

<p>I was an Obama supporter.  I can tell you with zero hesitation that if he OWNED any golf properties, if as an attack talking point someone asked me why he spent 75% of his at his own, I would immediately assume that person to be insane.  It just isnt even a rational question.  This is how delusional you people have become.</p>

<p>And the saddest part is you cant bring yourself to wake up.  You just keep swallowing each new confirmation bias hate article out of the media.</p>

<p>Quite sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>whats horrifying is that you even ask that question.</p>

<p>Would that question have been asked of an Obama supporter?  A Bill Clinton supporter?  A Jimmy Carter supporter? Why or why not?</p>

<p>The question shouldnt be one of &quot;turning against&quot; him.</p>

<p>He is human. He has made mistakes, even in the presidency, he will make more, undoubtedly. He has made decisions I didnt agree with, Im sure he will again.  Is that what you are asking?</p>

<p>Please define &quot;turn against&quot;?</p>

<p>Will I blindly swallow the media propaganda about him being somehow the root of all evil? A nazi, a racist, a sexual predator, a clown, mentally unfit, a con man, a xenophobe, heartless, a dictator...the list is nearly endless.  The media makes up new ones daily - and publishes them gleefully in massive headlines. </p>

<p><strong>NO, I will not</strong></p>

<p>Trump is the greatest president in modern history, one of the greats of all time, and that includes the founding fathers.</p>

<p>Anyone who hasnt yet realized is either on the payroll of the leftist media and democrat/entrenched swamp machine or remains asleep in the matrix they have created, the alternate reality where Trump really is all those vile things, even though in 30 years in the public eye as a billionaire and TV star he was well liked and never accused of any of that. </p>

<p>Somehow he magically transformed the minute the media detected he might win the primary <strong>RUH ROH!</strong></p>

<p>But you go ahead and stay asleep (or on the payroll, whichever it may be)</p>

<p>What if Trump admitted to using his position to personally profit? </p>

<p>What if he plead guilty to campaign finance fraud?</p>

<p>Would you still think he was the greatest president ever if he confessed to beating Melania in the White House?</p>

<p>If a Republican controlled congress impeaches him for appointing his friends in exchange for money?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you list of the fever dreams of a liberal puppet who has been indoctrinated without realizing it by the Trump hate media&#39;s 24/7 drip feed, and yet you tell me to put down the kool aid?</p>

<p>Again, would you have any of these fantasies about Obama? About Bill Clinton? About Bush?</p>

<p>The only one of these that is remotely possible is the congressional impeachment.  The reality is not what most people think. The presidents TRUE allies in the congress are a tiny minority (call them Trump Republicans).</p>

<p>The rest of congress are establishment dirtbags, and R or D dont matter. They hate Trump, and they look out for themselves and their donors and special interests.  Trump has managed to drag them along with him (barely) on a few things, like tax cuts, where his agenda matches their own, but the <strong>REALITY</strong> is that for the most part the congres HATES HIM for exposing their actual business model, and if Mueller delivered what he is supposed to, which is ANY impeachment excuse that would give them cover with the American people, I think they WOULD impeach him.  And it could be ANY excuse from Mueller.</p>

<p>This is why I have written for months now that Trump will undergo all these leftist narrative land mines up until the 2018 elections, and at that point the establishment left&#39;s time is up. If the American people do not give the establishment a majority, they cant impeach/remove, so that game will be over.  But it isnt a matter of R or D. Its a matter of establishment or unknown vs vocally and demonstrably Trump ally. Again, so far, his side, which is the american peoples side, has a tiny minority. Will the public change it in the midterms?</p>

<p>Thats up to the public.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, keep having your libporn fantasies.</p>

<p>You answered none of MY questions BTW.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a nice short read and uses simple language to detail a framework called selectorate theory. </p>

<p>The theory describes politicians as a function of the &quot;winning coalition&quot; or minimum number of people needed to get and keep power and subsequently describes all their actions in terms of how they can accomplish that singular goal.</p>

<p>For example it describes most idealistic politics (e.g. abortions, religion, guns, voter ID laws, immigration) as boiling down to being a means of creating a winning coalition from a given slice of the population so they can get elected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest cause of this situation are people being in love with ideologies that harm them.</p>

<p>What has conservatism really done for the average rural farmer in the last 40 years?</p>

<p>What has liberalism really done for the average city dweller in the last 40 years?</p>

<p>People are voting for fantasies pushed by politicians that do the bare minimum necessary to maintain the fantasy.</p>

<p>This is why some of us celebrate conservative tax cuts for corporations that actually harm or don&#39;t help individuals or provide jobs.</p>

<p>This is why some of us celebrate mostly-marketing social programs like Obama Care which really didn&#39;t do much for many. Those who couldn&#39;t afford it got fined. Those who needed critical care were still bankrupted.</p>

<p>Too many people listen to what these politicians say and don&#39;t watch what they do.</p>

<p>We are in a cycle of Democrats standing up a bunch of straw men and Republicans tearing them down in dramatic fashion. Meanwhile, the military budget climbs, consumer protection falls, the financial and infrastructure health of the masses declines, and very little progress is made for the majority of citizens.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> People are ignorant and stupid on both the left and the right, sometimes willfully so. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a conspiracy to keep the population dumb or down. The population <strong>is</strong> dumb and down. Now what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, the whole system needs a purge. But, short of a purge, DJT is the closest thing we have to a guy who really wants to make things better in America. We came close to the brink of absolute destruction of the USA from the inside with terrorist Obama. Had Hillary won, we would be annihilated by now, or very soon.</p>

<p>In this non-perfect world, we all have to support Trump to help him drain the swamp. The Trump hammer is the closest thing the People have to swinging our own fists in that swamp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree and I think this is true for all democracies, oligarchies etc. Politicians tend to be the worst among us in general. I think it reflects upon the psyche of the masses that we think that humans with sociopathic tendencies are better than us. I think it’s because the majority of us are inherently insecure, greedy, lustful, jealous etc. In our Indian philosophy these are all tamasik tendencies. My opinion is that our food, lifestyle, and alienation from a higher awareness, god, whatever causes these tendencies. What we need is a mass awareness and willingness to seek yoga (joining) with a greater consciousness. When society is satvik, or at least rajasik, we will elect better politicians to govern for us. Currently our social idols are pornstars, violent athletes, and immoral celebrities. Any outsider looking at us will not find it very hard to grasp why we have such shitty leaders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that wages and earnings are so low or moderate that many people have to work 2 jobs or side jobs just to make it. Therefore people don&#39;t have the time to discuss and deal with important topics confronting us. People are also distracted by sports and culture television just like was used by the emporer in Rome with the Roman circus.  On tops of all that the education system is used to produce worker bees and get us all in a fine tuned box instead if promoting individuality and creativity. Then the 2 political parties divide us further by highlighted issues that really don&#39;t matter as much, we need systematic change not to refuse to join or dint even talk to each other due to things like immigration,  abortion,  2nd amendment,  etc etc etc..... we need to realize we must join together to fight against the elite power elements in this world, we have the numbers and joining to together is our best chance and their worst fear that&#39;s why they do everything to prevent it,  don&#39;t let them!!!!!! Stand together and wake the f*** up!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s got a name. That name is neoliberalism.</p>

<p>You have all been told it hundreds, if not thousands of times. </p>

<p>But half of you have equated it to &quot;socialism&quot;, or &quot;liberals&quot; or some other corrupted term.</p>

<p>Yes, the world is not equitable. Yes, there are winners and losers in everything.</p>

<p>However, the &quot;American dream&quot; that everyone can make themselves what they want through hard work is an illusion pushed by those who do have the initial capital to make themselves richer.</p>

<p>Regulation is a MUST. In it&#39;s simplest form, unchecked capitalism breeds oligopolies and monopolies in every industry. It is trading the European royalty we escaped from, to serfdom under a new royalty: the capitalist elite. It leads to boom and bust cycle, due to the over accumulation of capital by a very small population. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a &quot;red&quot;, but the third way, the fine balance between capitalist freedom and social democratic regulation is the world we knew for only a brief time between WW2 and to just after Vietnam. </p>

<p>Keynesian economics, with a healthy dose of free market principles is the way forward.</p>

<p>Globalisation only makes rich richer, poor slightly better off, and the middle class destitute. Protectionist economics protects us, the middle. Therefore, regulation is vital.</p>

<p>To end my rant: prove me wrong by naming a single economic collapse since 1946 which wasn&#39;t helped (or exacerbated) by lack of government intervention.</p>

<p>And economics is 100% at the heart of all politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, as a european I&#39;ve always wondered about this:</p>

<p>With your government system being so bad and everyone (I hope) being aware of it, why does everyone just suck up and take it? Is it really that hard to rally people to petition for a reform to how the elections are done? I don&#39;t mean rioting (if it&#39;s not necessary), just petition or putting your activism where it counts. </p>

<p>Many societal problems in the US to me seem to be the direct result of the people completely unable to voice their discontent. No politician truly represents them as the choice is marginal at best, there are no labour unions, nobody to change education or healthcare costs. Frankly, your quality of life has been decreasing for a long time.</p>

<p>Is it going to continue until the majority of the people are literally starving or are you actually going to do anything about it now?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say we have a typical GOP candidate, Greg Gregson, vs. a typical DNC candidate...  Don Donson.

Don is for gun control, gay rights, pro-choice, better societal structures and safety nets, and higher taxes to pay for them.</p>

<p>I see you live in Canada and want to talk about socialized medicine. </p>

<p>Let’s do that. Let’s discuss how being allies and sharing a border with the worlds largest superpower affords you to luxury of having a virtually nonexistent military which you can then use the tax dollar savings to buy sup par healthcare. </p>

<p>Furthermore let’s discuss how Canadian price controls in the medical sector have no market basis and are subsidized by rate hikes to US citizens. </p>

<p>Let’s discuss how there are months long waiting lists for fundamental and sometime life saving procedures. </p>

I knew what trump would be and that russia would control him the moment i heard of him being a candidate. when you are familliar with russian schemes 1st hand, its SO OBVIOUS.Even my prime minister is also an &quot;anti-regime&quot; &quot;successful businessman&quot; &quot;white male&quot; &quot;family man&quot;, who also happens to have &quot;shady ties to russia&quot; and his laws have nothing to do with the well-being of the people of my country. Rings a bell?</p>

<p>Anyway, I never expected any deep thinking from a trump voter anyway, else they wouldnt be trump voters, right? But seriously, no offence, im sure you are quick to call conspiracy theory on the dems but have the guts to admit that youve been played by the russian propoganda and cyberwar espionage machine and learn from mistakes.</p>

There were intelligence statements about the russians having &quot;intel on clintons&quot;, that was unrelated with emails and not otherwise released into the world.
