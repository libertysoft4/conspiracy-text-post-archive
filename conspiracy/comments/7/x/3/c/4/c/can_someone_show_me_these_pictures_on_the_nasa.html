<p>It shows the 2012 picture with a crazy disproportionate size of the earth, is it even from NASA though, or is it just a fake &quot;fake&quot; picture?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Globebusters did a recent interview with one of the guys from FES - it seemed like a decent debate. When I went to the FES boards site it required a registration so I noped out...read their <em>theory</em> and decided that sounded antithetical to the overall claim.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been anti-Moon anti NASA for eons. In all honesty I started looking at FE as a way to ease thru Pizza Gate trauma. This most recent scam with Elon and our Tax Dollars going to subsidize his BS really pisses me off but there it is - I&#39;m not in control of TPTB.</p>

<p>From the moon the earth would be indescernible from a perfect sphere. But it is a little fatter in the bottom.</p>

<p>The mentality of the people who are floored by the pear shaped notion are only showing their ignorance. If the earth was the size of a basketball our atmosphere would be equivalent to a sheet of paper over it. </p>

<p>The earth is freaking huge when compared to a humans perception

<p>Yeah, that little thing used between sentences helps sort out the confusion between.</p>

<p>I sure didn&#39;t get the <em>perspective</em> between the Earth size declared by Elon in his little escapade. I&#39;m damned positive that ISS has never shown that much of the Earth and where the fuck were all the other landmasses around Australia?</p>

<p>If you look at the live camera right now the earth still seems freaking huge and it has been ripping away for days!</p>

<p>I hope Brandon does some space shit soon so all the marching morons can pick on a guy I don&#39;t admire. </p>

<p>Pushing the electric agenda is necessary for our break from fossil fuels. Making giant solar batteries for remote villages will improve the living conditions for millions on this planet. </p>

<p>Pushing development into getting off this rock is also a necessity of we are going to get to type one anytime soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically there hasn&#39;t been a real picture of the earth since the 1970s. All the pictures produced since then are composite images stitched together in photoshop cue the &quot; it&#39;s photoshopped.... it, it has to be&quot;. If you were on the moon and were looking at earth it would be huge, yet the classic picture from the moon has the earth the same size as the moon would be and if you turn the contrast up there&#39;s a discolored square around the earth, kind of odd isn&#39;t it? The explanation for the different size continents and such is that the pictures are taken from different distances from the earth but the earth appears a similar size and shape without any frame of reference.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there any dispute that NDT said that the Globe is pudgy, oblate more pear shaped? Or that many major Scientists are now looking at a Flat Universe with earth at the Center? Really, the highest I&#39;ve ever flown is about 36 thousand feet. I&#39;ve sat shot gun in a Cessna. </p>
