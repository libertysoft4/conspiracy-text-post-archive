<p>His next step in making NASA look like fools is when he tries to get healthy people across the Van Allen belts.

    <div class="md"><p>Hard to explain. I would say, now I&#39;m not so sure we can actually go to what we call space.</p>

<p>I used to use the VA belts as an argument that the moon landings were fake. Of course I still think they are fake. But, there seems to be so much confusion and dissonance about the belts that they seem more like a fictional construct.</p>

<p>Take a look at this clip from Alan Bean, the supposed 4th man to walk on the moon. Here, he proves the moon landings were fake simply by not knowing that his mission would have traversed the belts. But, the more I watch this and think about it, it makes more sense that the belts are just bullshit and he hasn&#39;t yet prepared himself to talk about them from their accompanying script.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2FTZhyuJy8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2FTZhyuJy8</a></p>

<p>Anyway, if you ask someone who believes in Apollo they say things like, the missions just went through the belts really fast so there were no health hazards. It just all seems like bullshit, to be honest. Bringing them into a debate about the moon missions only causes more headaches because one side insists that they are deadly and another side insists that it&#39;s no big deal if you go through them really fast, or go through at the poles, or whatever. But the fact is, both sides are sort of full of it. They don&#39;t know about these belts because no human has ever traveled that high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally get your skepticism about the belts.</p>

<p>I generally believe they exist because it fits my full model of how the solar system works. My views on the subject are far from mainstream.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that the sun is mostly hydrogen. I don&#39;t think Jupiter is gas, either. I think that light may lower its wavelength over immense distances, so I don&#39;t even believe the universe is expanding.</p>

<p>I do believe that the corona of the sun is undergoing reactions that send positively charged particles our way, and it makes sense to me that they would form a belt around the planet, and as they slow, they would tend to fall into the poles...</p>

<p>That said, I have no reason to distrust Van Allen himself... I just distrust generally =P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have signed up for the moon thing. To me, that&#39;s worth the risk. Test pilot for terrestrial stuff... not so much.</p>

<p>OMG... to walk on the moon. I&#39;m just giddy thinking about it.</p>

<p>But, back to physics, a field of positively charged nuclei travelling near light speed, hitting the metal shell of the capsule as it was reportedly built, would have exposed the crew to lots of radiation. The best case scenario would be radiation sickness.</p>

<p>I do not believe they missed the belts through a polar exit, because their inclination was quite low. I think they faked it in 69, and maybe went back later, with different technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure most people agree that Armstrong strode across the moon in &#39;69... and I&#39;m not trying to convince anyone. I don&#39;t think we could convince each other, here, anyways...</p>

<p>But, since I&#39;m in the &quot;Earth is round, most of science is valid, but the... um... moon landing was a hoax&quot; camp, part of the objection is &quot;How&#39;d ya get through the belts&quot;</p>

<p>I think they&#39;re there. I think it makes perfect sense that they are there, and I think they would eviscerate human tissue. As a policy, we don&#39;t send people into the belt. Other than the moon landings, humans have stayed in low earth orbit.</p>

<p>Surely they would have sent SOMEONE further out... but they can&#39;t, because it&#39;s horrible proton death soup out there. Anyways, that&#39;s my opinion :p.</p>

<p>They may have gone later, but I think they just faked in in 69 to poke the commies in the eye. =P Sputnik and all that. I used to be... a... I guess, &quot;Neo-conservative&quot;. Back then, I totally would have faked it to save us from commies, and my dad would have, too. Patriotism... yay.</p>

<p>You could pull this off with far fewer insiders than the manhattan project, so... yeah. We controlled all the info going into mission control, and we just faked the feeds for all the people back in Houston.</p>

<p>We built miniature scale models of every piece we were going to encounter, and we filmed them for use in the simulations the astronauts used for landing. The only parts they didn&#39;t actually simulate as part of the confirmed, above board operations... was the actual walking around and stuff on the surface.</p>

<p>So, I think they faked it... but since I&#39;ve only covered about 3% of the &quot;Why&quot;, I don&#39;t expect you to be convinced.</p>

<p>It took me about six years to go from &quot;Moon Hoaxers are idiots&quot; to &quot;Oh, shit... maybe we did fake it.&quot; I encourage space enthusiasts to spend that kind of time... but it&#39;s not really a hot issue for me.</p>

<p>Central banking is my hot issue.</p>

<p>I just like it when Musk does things at 50% the price of NASA, and then goes even lower. I LIKE space exploration, and I&#39;ve always wanted the private sector to kick it up a notch and make the bloated behemoth, NASA look bad. Have a wonderful day :)</p>
