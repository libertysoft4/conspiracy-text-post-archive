<p>Have you ever seen a more civil discussion on Pizzagate?  It&#39;s almost as if the thread is designed to be debunked by a team or coordinated effort seeking to look level-headed and reasonable.</p>

<p>Then we have the repeating Abramovic posts, with comments proclaiming her innocence and disbelief this poor 71-yr old woman is being scrutinized.  Kinda odd Abramovic is getting any press at all.  You&#39;d think they want to hide her.</p>

<p>Just an observation on some things that caught my attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s pretty weird...  I&#39;m trying to be genuine, respectful, and grounded.  I think that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar and I think that the useful idiots over at tmor likely respond positively to my attitude.  I&#39;m not trying to promote anything but the truth.  Right now, I don&#39;t know if pizzagate is real or not, but I do know that there&#39;s a lot of evidence and a lot of things that should be explained.</p>

<p>Biggest thing I want is a COMPLETE mapping of the DC tunnels as well as a forensic analysis of the portions and entrances near the Pegasus Museum and other suspicious locations.</p>

<p>The fact that it was somehow easier for JA to get Megyn Kelley to give him a softball interview in which he&#39;s just declared 100% innocent without addressing any of the facts than it was for him to just open Buck&#39;s basement for tours and/or open the Pegasus Museum for tours is astounding.  It&#39;s very suspicious that the news media rallied around and proclaimed the whole thing debunked before any real investigation took place.</p>

<p>I would have probably completely dropped the whole thing after a couple months if they got on the TV and said &quot;Yo yo yo calm yo tits, angry mob.  The police are evaluating the whole thing and doing the best they can.  Please don&#39;t be vigilantes.  We don&#39;t know the facts of the situation.&quot;  Instead they vehemently denied and it was frustrating to see the mountains of evidence debunked by their word!</p>

If David Brock Media Matter shills really do lurk this sub and the_donald, I think they would have a much easier time blending in on r/conspiracy. T_D is just an echo chamber, so obviously you&#39;re not going to see many shills commenting without getting banned from the sub. You&#39;re really going to stand out trying to debunk Pizzagate in T_D, so your argument doesn&#39;t really hold up.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy isn&#39;t a circlejerk like T_D, it would be much easier to infiltrate. I mean, didn&#39;t a Voat Pizzagate mod just get outed for being friends with James Alefantis on Instagram? </p>

<p>That said, if a person was following Pizzagate wouldn&#39;t following Alefantis on Instagram be one way to keep track?</p>

I&#39;m still looking into his debunking, but this whole thing blew up a bit so I&#39;ve been distracted with a bunch of angry PMs calling me a shill and telling me to die and shit...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted a large info dump of research material from early on in the pizzagate investigation in reply to one of OPs comments, in case there was anything in it he hadn&#39;t seen before and wanted to look over. It subsequently got downvoted into oblivion.<br/>
Admittedly, I think my comments got singled out for downvotes because in my first comment in the thread I said that I didn&#39;t trust the user &quot;pizzagate_researcher&quot; because his comments tend to always dismiss pizzagate and use dismissive language, rather than objectively analysing it or even entertaining the idea. I recognise it&#39;s an ad homenim when used in a debate and I that do have a slight bias against people who don&#39;t entertain both sides, but it was my opinion and I thought I&#39;d share it. </p>

<p>There definitely is evidence that there is a coordinated effort to debunk pizzagate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what is that evidence? I&#39;ve been called a paid shill, a paedophile, and even been accused of being Alefantis&#39;s boyfriend simply for pointing out the weakenss of the pizzagate case, but I&#39;ve never been paid to post, I&#39;ve never coordinated my posts with anyone else, and I&#39;ve certainly never met Alefnatis (or Podesta or any of the others). Is it so hard to conceive that there are people who require a much higher standard of evidence than has been presented? Why are you not simialrly charging that there has been a coordinated effort to promote pizzagate (what with the creation of a pizzagate sub here and at voat, the psoting of numerous Youtube videos, and the organisation of protests in Washington)? Why is that unremarkable but when a few people post rebuttals to the pizzagate narrative it&#39;s suddenly some conspiracy in itself?</p>

<p>do you honestly think that&#39;s the case?  Thousands of people look at the same evidence and find it compelling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And what is that evidence?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want me to tediously repost and collate the same things that&#39;s said over and over?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>at voat, the psoting of numerous Youtube videos</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re aware of where/how to find evidence to look at on your own, yet you are asking me what evidence there is?</p>

<p>You can totally post arguments against pizzagate, I&#39;d be fine with that, but you can&#39;t acknowledge that you&#39;ve seen evidence while feigning that you need help finding it.  It doesn&#39;t lend much to your credibility. </p>

<p>Regardless of what you think about pizzagate, FUCK ambrovavich!  Someone who is a self-avowed Satanist whose idea of a good time is mock cannibalism (or real cannibalism?) CAN NEVER be considered a sweet old lady.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be a religious person to recognize that some people are religious and their religion is like serving the dark lord...  Like imagine if someone was convinced Voldemort were real and they openly praise him and pledge to do his bidding, you don&#39;t have to agree that Voldemort is real to know that that person is up to no good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because theres accounts in here and the other thread saying thanks for posting and nothing else, yet the tone of each thread is different. </p>

<p>It almost seems like someones just flooding new accounts into conspiracy to fvck with everyones minds here. Especially, considering the new rul concerning no comments/posts from under 3 month old accounts, and yet alot of the accounts have very very little activity any where else or are accounts that have about a year or more age to them but with little activity at all. But very specifically have conspiracy activity.</p>

<p>hence the lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did a lot of studying on Abromovic right before the elections when pgate was in full force. Interestingly her brother (I think her brother... if not, it was a relative) is heavily invested into studying Nikola Tesla. He has written many things about his life etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why I thought this was significant at the time... I found it very interesting though. I think my interest spurred from curiosity of if his sister, Maria, had the same interest in Tesla. </p>

<p>I think I was trying to figure out if Tesla&#39;s findings could somehow be related to Maria&#39;s beliefs. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a fan of Tesla, I don&#39;t want or try to connect him to Satanism. I just feel that it could be significant that the Abromovics, Maria and her brother, are interested in two subjects that are shrouded in mystery and controversy. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find any significant connections at the time, but I just wanted to mention it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted this on a previous thread. Kinda fucked up shit,
I started researching some of Aleister Crowley&#39;s books because of your information and it&#39;s very dark. I came across a ritual called the &quot;Mass of the Phoenix&quot;. So how it&#39;s performed is basically a wafer made from meal, honey, olive oil, Oil of Abramelin and blood/bodily fluids. It&#39;s stated in his book about what blood to use. Reminds me of spirit cooking with Marina Abramovic.</p>

<p>&quot;The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child, or dropping from the host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers: last of some beast, no matter what. (AL.III.23-4)&quot;</p>

<p>Ok, so I decided to do a youtube search on &quot;Mass of the Phoenix&quot;. I found a disturbing result. A mom and a young girl performing the ritual together. The other videos they posted are kind of weird, almost like the mom is showing off the little girl for who knows what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe i peaced-out too early in that thread, but i thought the point of the post was to show evidence that pizzagate was legit. i thought it was trying to show the connection between the child-smuggling from Haiti to the US, while also showing that the children&#39;s charities doing work there were full of pedophiles having orgies with underage prostitutes.</p>

<p>granted, the user who posted the gigantic comment with 280 upvotes was not there when i was looking at it.</p>

<p>edit: someone please give it to me straight: is pizzagate legit, or is it just another distraction?</p>

<p>Pedophilia exists. Child abuse, child smuggling, underage prostitution, all exist. All of the above being coordinated by a group of democrats out of a pizza parlor? No, not even close.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the interesting part to all of this. 
There is plenty of evidence out there to support the theory that there&#39;s an international ring of child trafficking pedophiles - that at the very least is frequented by high profile politicians, celebrities and law enforcement. </p>

<p>But then it gets wrapped up into a Pizza Parlour, with a lot of odd circumstantial evidence and a lot of red herrings, and now people bicker back and forth only about the Pizza place stuff while ignoring everything else. </p>

<p>Point goes to the elite for dividing the Conspiracy subculture and making everybody chase phantoms and their own tails. </p>

<p>It&#39;s probably because the artist (Kehinde Wiley) who painted that bizarre official portait of Barrack Obama has been linked to Marina Abramovic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know a couple of girls in their 20s who claim they religiously follow Wicca, do rituals and have alters with baphomets and hanging pentagram tapestries ECT ECT. They are the sort of people who would actually worship and appreciate the work of abramovic. We live in a world where everyone is able to practice what they want and unfortunately for a lot of young women, abromavic is portrayed as their Tumblr edgy role model. It really doesn&#39;t surprise me that she&#39;s not hidden away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to bite my tongue and not comment but those girls are morons. Wiccans honor the Goddess and the Green God.They worship the Earth and nature. Pentacles are used to represent the 4 elements and Spirit. Baphomet and pentagrams have nothing to do with Wicca, they are practicing a bastardized version closer to Satanism. Just my 2 cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been a coordinated, full-spectrum propaganda and action push across America in the past few days. The shills are out in force all over social media and Reddit, there&#39;s another big school shooting, the military is ramping it up against Syria and the Russians. Today we&#39;ve got a New Yorker story about Trump&#39;s affair with a Playboy playmate.</p>

<p>Lots of wheels in motion. Can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s a desperate last Hail Mary play or the bad guys are back on top for sure. </p>

<p>But that Pizzagate post is a total disgrace, from the initial &quot;info graphic&quot; to the enormous engagement from people who are there to cheer on the debunking. Very concerned about what&#39;s going on in this sub. :-(</p>
