<p>In almost every single thread, no matter the conspiracy, the discussion always seems to end up with one group calling another group out, slurring, etc. baseless attacks to derail the thread.</p>

<p>It’s been awhile since I’ve browsed this sub and actually found substance. It’s now a toxic breeding ground for arguments somewhat similar to Facebook or r/politics.</p>

<p>As an avid conspiracy theorist, I’m formally requesting that the mods step up and begin seriously moderating the threads and comments for things that are obviously biased to one group, or political party. </p>

<p>With conspiracy’s we need to have a birds eye perspective. What is best for everyone. How to tell the truth.</p>

<p>This was one of my favorite subreddits when I came to Reddit years ago. Let’s get back to that. If there’s a better way than what I’ve brought up, let’s please find it. Whatever we can do, we need to do it.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time</p>

<p>Edit: you fuckers buried this! </p>

<p>Edit: so many accounts under a year old brigading this. Hmmmmmmmmmmm</p>

<p>Edit: incredible how this was instantly downvoted to 0, and has never even reached 1, did I hit a weak spot?</p>

<p>Edit: almost 50 comments and not one upvote for the post? Lmao this site is so obvious with its bullshit </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the biggest conspiracy theory of our time is that Trump colluded with Russia in the 2016 election. I think it&#39;s strange that people wouldn&#39;t want to talk about that in a conspiracy sub. It&#39;s even more strange that people don&#39;t really think of it as a conspiracy theory. They think it&#39;s proven.</p>

<p>We get enough censorship here from the /politics/ gang running rampant with the downvotes, which hides posts and comments from people who disagree with their echo chamber, so we don&#39;t need any more censorship from you.</p>

<p>Sorry if you&#39;re not interested in politics... but this is the big one right now. This would be like showing up after 9/11 and telling people &quot;let&#39;s not talk about planes and buildings and whatnot&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean we absolutely could, we just don’t have to have a partisan take to it. We had these discussions years ago, now it seems as though it’s almost impossible, because the community seems to think it can’t happen. It has happened and r/conspiracy was a much more thought provoking society. Like I said in my original post, it’s almost down to r/politics levels of just whatever fucking side people are on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I mostly agree with you. I think maybe the best solution might be some sort of &quot;good faith participation rule.&quot; </p>

<p>Personally, I think the shills goal has always been to divide and conquer this sub. I see how they did it, and its really not that surprising to me that it worked. And now they&#39;ve got their votebots going on many threads and they&#39;ve pretty much hijacked the sub. I know they want to silence regular users and I hate to potentially let them win, but there are so many other forums that aren&#39;t nearly as shilled out as this one has become. I find myself coming here far less often than I used to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your title is still your title.  I made a comment based on your title.</p>

<p>There is nothing to add to this discussion that is a request for censorship.  Pointing out the hypocrisy is indeed adding something.  It&#39;s been so thought provoking you apparently cant seem to shut up.  All you&#39;ve got is personal insults and attacks on character because at some point even you realize the ridiculousness of your request.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so. In my experience, people&#39;s perception of what&#39;s &quot;not contributing&quot; or &quot;bullshitting&quot; or &quot;shilling&quot; is heavily biased by their own political persuasion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think I agree with that. I can tell when someone is bsing. There are threads that have no mention of politics, then someone brings up trump or Clinton and the whole thread goes to shit and no one decides to comment anymore because they’re tired of seeing the same shit I am. It’s just fucking lame r/conspiracy has fallen so far. This place used to be an internet research pinnacle. Now it’s a toxic breeding ground similar to Facebook.</p>

<p>It used to be about information. Now it’s about “whose side you’re on.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. </p>

<p>However, that’s not what I’m trying to accomplish and if it is coming off as tyrannical I guess I need to study tone more. </p>

<p>I’m not asking for censorship. I’m asking for the mods to do what they’re supposed to, and clean up the bullshit that has infested this sub. Everything is an argument.</p>

<p>Like I said in another comment, it used to be about the information. The truth. The outcome. The answers. Not it seems like it’s about “whose side you’re on”</p>

<p>It shouldn’t be that way. I want to get rid of that toxic energy in this community. However it seems like it is a futile effort</p>
