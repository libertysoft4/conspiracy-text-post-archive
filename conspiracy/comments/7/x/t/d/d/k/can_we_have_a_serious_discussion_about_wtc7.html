        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">175</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-02-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/DFW_1996.html">DFW_1996</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the <a href="http://www1.ae911truth.org/faqs/682-how-did-they-know-examining-the-foreknowledge-of-building-7s-destruction.html">BBC and CNN</a> segments from that time of day many times and think that we need to have an organized discussion of the implications.  For context before we begin, BBC is owned by the British people and operates as a statutory corporation with a royal charter, and CNN is owned by Turner which is owned by Time Warner.  </p>

<p>First of all, both sources claim that the WTC-7 has collapsed before it actually has.  This is very strange because before 9/11/01 no steel-framed building had every experienced full collapse due to fire, even much older, weaker buildings experiencing much longer, larger fires.  Why, then, would BBC&#39;s and CNN&#39;s sources confidently state to them that an unprecedented event (the collapse of a steel-frame building due to fires without the presence of jet fuel) would occur momentarily?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s briefly remind ourselves here that 118 NYC firefighters and first responders claim to have heard explosions coming from below ground in the Twin Towers and the 9/11 and NIST Reports claim that they encountered no evidence of explosions in any of these cases.  Of course the reason for this is that they did not look for <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/gallery/evidence.html">evidence of explosions</a>, of which there is plenty.  To summarize this group&#39;s finings, no, the debris from the collapsing Twin Towers could not have taken down WTC-7 via the scattering of debris and a couple of office fires.  And certainly not almost symmetrically and at free fall.</p>

<p>Summarizing up to this point: two media entities claim that WTC-7 has either collapsed or may collapse.  This implies they have the same source, as it is preposterous to claim that something &quot;has either collapsed or may collapse&quot; when we can see it standing outside the window behind the person making the claim!  With our own eyes we can confirm that the report is false.  And to hear the same false report from two sources simultaneously is very strange.  But does this mean that the companies themselves had foreknowledge of the collapse?  No, rather it just means that they received probably the same report of that statement.  Since they are mostly reporting entities and not investigative journalistic entities, this is in line with what we would expect them to do even absent foul play.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, the CIA itself has acknowledged that it 1) <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-cia-and-the-media-50-facts-the-world-needs-to-know/5471956">has assets in all major American newsrooms</a> (and it&#39;s not a far leap to extrapolate that to the BBC) and 2) that it reserves the right to disclose to some journalists <a href="https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2018/02/cia-selective-disclosure/">but not others</a>.</p>

<p>What seems most likely here, given that I&#39;m pretty sure that all three buildings game down via controlled demolition that many high-ranking defense personnel were aware, is that these media entities were fed the same claim by the same source to prepare people for the possibility that a very large building would soon collapse against all odds and unexpectedly.  This forewarning, especially while the vast majority of viewers were not taking a skeptical stance toward what they were hearing, served exactly the purpose as was intended.  Today, you will hear people defend the foreknowledge by alluding to the fact that firefighters who were there just before the collapse told people to back up because WTC-7 was about to come down.  This is a preposterous defense because, as discussed above, any real firefighter would be well-aware that there is no logical reason that the building should collapse.  The question then should become &quot;who is this firefighter and how did <em>he</em> have accurate foreknowledge of the impossible?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to see any mention of no-planes or nukes or missiles or the Pentagon or the Twin Towers or any of that.  Let&#39;s just discuss the events of that afternoon as informed by our knowledge of state-infiltration of major media and our knowledge of the events of that afternoon (unless you have some important context that is missing here that you would like to add).</p>

<p>One love everybody!</p>

<p>To truly awaken you need to question <em>everything</em> incl. your own beliefs and theories and accept that you can probably never know for sure so you can never be as certain of <em>anything</em> as you obviously are in that statement you just made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No... when it comes to 9/11 MAJORITY of truthers at one time or another believed the government propaganda story. </p>

<p>You can say we will never figure it ALL out and agree, because shit, it&#39;s been 17!FUCKING YEARS and shit has been written into history, let alone drilled into people&#39;s minds ( which, if you&#39;ve never taken psychology and looked into mind control, or heard GW literally say he need to &quot;keep repeating things&quot; to &quot;ya know, huh, catapult the propaganda&quot;). </p>

<p>So maybe you need to re-evaluate your stance one what you hold to be &quot;truth&quot;, good sir, as we who have come to the conclusion that 9/11 was a manipulation of the greatest magnitude and no, it wasn&#39;t because we were duped into doing so.</p>

Everything else is wishful thinking. But how many people do we need to acknowledge a truth before we call it fact? Demolition expert Danny Jowenko took one look at the collapse of building seven and said, &quot;That&#39;s controlled demolition. Definitely.&quot; I agree that one needs to exercise the humility of doubt, but in the case of building seven one also needs to acknowledge the overwhelming probability is that its collapse was the result of controlled demolition. As Occam would have said it, &quot;If it looks like a duck, and it walks like a duck, it is unlikely a chicken.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh a bulge huh? See this is why trying to speak to people is like running your head into a brick wall over and over again. Most are just too damn stupid to use their own eyes, and their own critical thinking skills. If you can tell someone “there was a bulge which precipitated the collapse” and they buy this explanation without questioning the symmetrical free fall speed...the BBC announcing the collapse before it happened...the countless other steal frame buildings throughout history that have been engulfed in fire and burned far longer and they still didn’t collapse...and on and on and on. Let’s not forget those that don’t even know of building 7 collapse that day...these stupid mothers haven’t even taken 5mins to even do the most basic of research. Do I need to continue...doesn’t this willingness to except whatever BS that is fed to us by MSM &amp; and gov shills without the slightest of independent investigation explain why we’re where were at today!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No man. You&#39;re the close minded fool. You like the idea it was a controlled demolition. You read just enough to verify your belief&#39;s and then never question them.</p>

<p>You&#39;re so deep in your arrogant fantasy world you assume everyone you talk to is either stupid or hasn&#39;t researched this issue as thoroughly as you.</p>

<p>Yet you&#39;re the one repeating untruths.</p>

<p>-It was symmetrical... no, no it wasn&#39;t, the collapse initiated east to west internally, starting from the east penthouse, you can even see open air through the upper windows, and rippling down the side of the building in the collapse footage. Then with no internal bracing the columns buckled... and seeing as how the building had a special construction where the outside walls are ridgedly tied together... then the outside walls began to come down. Not to mention it only fell realitvely straight down for first 20 stories or so...it then fell over across a 4 lane street and part of the building struck another building across it. </p>

<p>-It fell at free fall speed... No, no it didn&#39;t. For 8 stories, or around 100 feet it fell near free fall speed, but not at it all. The reason for this is the same reason for why if you stand on a piece of spaghetti it buckles and boom you come down at free fall speed.</p>

<p>-countless other steel framed buildings have burned for longer and have never collapsed...no, not true at all. There was one in Iran just last year, and there have been many others that were partially steel framed construction and when they burned guess what happened...the portion that was steel framed collapsed. Steel framed buildings are vulnerable to fire, which is why they apply fire proofing....but it can only delay the effects of a fire. Building 7 was at least a 4 alarm fire that burned with no fire fighting response for something like 7 hours. Duh.</p>

<p>-bbc announced the collapse beforehand.... Well ya that&#39;s true but if you look into or ask the woman who announced it why...she explains it was a misunderstanding when her colleague said to her &quot;building 7 collapsed&quot; or whatever and she just ran with it. </p>

<p>Nevermind the bulge the firefighters noticed at 2pm and evacuated the area expecting it to come down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;There are some people who realize that the physical evidence indicates that the official story is wrong, but don&#39;t understand what purpose or interest the government may have had in carrying out the attacks and thus have a psychological relation to the entire event as remaining quite mysterious even though the government&#39;s claims are patently absurd. I&#39;ll resolve that for you.</p>

<p>On 9/11/91 Bush Sr. spoke before Congress calling for a new world order. Alright, so the president is announcing a major initiative to the world. What could he be up to?</p>

<p>As the USSR was collapsing, there were major operations underway to seize control of their industry. We need to lay down a little historical context for those unaware before proceeding.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1980s the CIA was heavily involved in cocaine and arms trafficking, money laundering, etc. The most famous name here might be Oliver North, but Bush Sr. is neck deep. Mena, Arkansas is a major hub for this operation under the jurisdiction of Bill Clinton. Long trail of deaths surrounding North, Clinton, Bush, Mena, etc. You can educate yourself on those details.</p>

<p>This scandal goes mainstream around 1986. In 1989 you get the first major form of collateralized debt obligations in the form of Brady Bonds, invented by Bush Sr.&#39;s treasury secretary. Minimally informed people are aware of the centrality of CDOs to the 2008 financial panic and the endemic fraud to securities trades of this type.</p>

<p>One of the Bush/North associates is Neil Livingstone, who acts as a go between to Semion Mogilevich. Mogilevich is one of the biggest mafia leaders in the USSR at the time. Mogilevich has had money laundering through the Bank of New York exposed to the tune of $10 billion. He is a major arms dealer at the time, and also heavily connected to al-Qaeda. Part of a bargain Livingstone tried to broker with DoJ involved Mogilevich handing over a bunch of his al-Qaeda connections.</p>

<p>Around 9/11/91 a bunch of fraudulent Brady Bonds are issued through the Bank of New York, Mogilevich&#39;s personal money laundering machine. This manifests ten years later. If you go back and look at the settlement imbalances at banks after 9/11, even the banks operating out of WTC complexes don&#39;t have any real settlement issues. There is one major exception however: Mogilevich&#39;s money laundering hub, the Bank of New York, is reporting book imbalances in excess of $100 billion per day following the attacks. The rules governing security clearance were lifted immediately after 9/11 - allegedly due to widespread problems - but really just to allow BoNY to clear it&#39;s balances without a record. It&#39;s worth noting that BoNY did not sustain structural damage on 9/11 - not in the WTC.</p>

<p>So these 100s of billions of fraudulent securities that were not clearing in the days after 9/11 - where did they come from? What were they used for? This is how the west launched their invasion of Russia following the collapse. You&#39;ll find exposes about crates of freshly printed US bills being shipped to Russia like The Money Plane in NY Magazine, used to buy influence; the other side of this is the securities fraud used to buy assets. It&#39;s estimated that something like 40-50% of Russia had been bought up through the mafia by late 92 or 1993.</p>

<p>In 2000/2001 Putin comes onto the scene. He starts nationalizing Russian assets that were seized by the US via the above mentioned securities fraud / money laundering and putting pressure on the mob. Next thing you know 9/11 happens. There are a lot of bones to pick with the official story, but rather than taking up those issues I&#39;d like to highlight the importance of some officially acknowledged but underreported facts.</p>

<p>On 9/9/01 Ahmad Massoud is assassinated by a fake TV crew that disguised a bomb as a TV camera. Two days later the secret service denies access to a couple of guys claiming to have an interview lined up with Bush in Florida on the morning of 9/11. This is our first direct threat against Bush of the day and indication of some larger plot than hijacked planes. Upon learning of the attacks, Bush insists on returning directly to Washington. In flight, a threat is received in the form of a call from an unknown source saying &quot;Angel is next,&quot; angel being code for the president that only insiders would have. (* &quot;Can you confirm the substance of that threat that was telephoned in...that Air Force One is next and using code words?&quot; Fleischer: &quot;Yes, I can. That&#39;s correct.&quot;(September 13)* )Bush is at this point aware that there is some sort of coup effort going on; for example, all the reporter&#39;s onboard AF1 are required to turn their cellphones off because they are worried about the attacking faction tracking cell signals - a capability we can all agree is well beyond that of al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>So Bush is under threat from people with high level insider knowledge. Press secretary acknowledged all this on national TV the day after (Angel is next being called in). Bush diverts to Barksdale which is basically the #2 nuclear command site. After a couple hours there he proceeds to Offutt, which is the #1 nuclear command site. You should also be aware of a variety of drills running on the day of 9/11, Vigilant Guardian. This is a full scale mock up of nuclear war; the whole infrastructure is activated for first strike (incidentally, part of the Vigilant Guardian drill in 2001 included a hijacking of planes as the instigator of the conflict). So what is Bush doing going to Barksdale and Offutt? Clearly trying to bring the nuclear forces to heel in light of learning of high level insider power plays.</p>

<p>This might be starting to sound a bit over the top - high level insiders seizing control of nuclear infrastructure and threatening the president with it. But only a few years later we have a similar incident in 2007 as 6 nuclear weapons are seized, generally regarded as intended for use starting the war in either Iran or Georgia. Later, in 2013, we again have nukes going off base unauthorized. Hours after it was reported in the media Sen. Graham is on TV warning of a nuke hit on South Carolina to be blamed on Syrian rebels; two of top nuclear commanders get dismissed in the following weeks. So high level insider fighting over the nuclear arsenal is pretty standard stuff, well known to the public.</p>

<p>With the question of a struggle over the nuclear arsenal now being common sense rather than shocking, we consider Bush caving to the terrorism line and starting the whole war on terror. You have Putin immediately backing off the seizure of assets in Russia. It won&#39;t be until the last couple of years that Putin resumes his assertion of authority over Russia; the US responds in kind with attacks on Syria and Ukraine but Russia has since quietly updated it&#39;s missile program and is prepared for nuclear war this time around; you now see a defiant Putin in the face of the 9/11 coup faction. Alongside this remarkable shift in geopolitics, there is an emerging anti-dollar block with the BRIC countries establishing an infrastructure bank last year. Just weeks ago, Glazyev announced this and is widely regarded as being the mouth of Putin; he organized the recent gas deal with Chin for example.</p>

<p>So you see 9/11 was a pivotal event used to extend the US dollar empire under threat of nuclear war for another 10-15 years in the face of an assertive Putin back in 2001 and growing domestic problems for the US Government. (You may recall the 90s was full of anti government militancy, concern over globalization, NAFTA, extraordinary distrust, in general what you would expect of citizens in an empire with no apparent external threat ... the cold war had ended)</p>

<p>So now that broad outline of purpose and motivation for 9/11 is clear, it&#39;s easier to come to terms with what your eyes tell you looking at Building 7 implode into its foot print at free fall for example. You don&#39;t even necessarily have to view it as an evil thing; the US people are quite severely fucked without something being done to backstop the US dollar.&quot;</p>

<p>At least part of that is a myth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Colonel Mark Tillman said he and his crew received a radio message saying &#39;Angel is next&#39; as America reeled from the attack on the twin towers.</p>

<p>Angel was the secret call sign for Air Force One as it left Sarasota, Florida, where President Bush had been told about the attacks on the Twin Towers.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2034423/9-11-message-Air-Force-One-pilot-Mark-Tillman-got-flew-President-Bush.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2034423/9-11-message-Air-Force-One-pilot-Mark-Tillman-got-flew-President-Bush.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;An entry at 10:20 a.m. notes Bush &quot;authorized shoot down if reason&quot; — a reference to the president deciding that, if a hijacked airliner were dangerously on course with a potential target, fighter planes could be allowed to fire. The false threat to Air Force One — &quot;Angel is next&quot; — comes in via the White House switchboard at 10:32 a.m.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a48495/air-force-one-handwritten-notes/">https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a48495/air-force-one-handwritten-notes/</a></p>

<p>Your link doesn&#39;t even dispute the fact that someone threatened Angel, it just says there may have been a way for an outsider to know this was a call sign for Air Force One. The fact that the article also relies on the 9/11 commission, and claims to call this a myth while admitting all the material facts pretty much buries this claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just denying facts I&#39;ve already proven and trying to shout me down with low effort bullshit <em>once again</em>? Why are you even allowed to comment here if you&#39;re going to engage in blatant, low effort propaganda, denying facts already proven and then get magically upvoted in spite of your comments being a steaming heap of dogshit? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You have not stated a coherent thesis, and I already refuted the claims of your idiotic article (which refutes it&#39;s <em>own</em> claims, by showing that the threats to Air Force One were <em>not</em> a myth.) You can&#39;t read your own fucking article and you&#39;re mouthing off about reading comprehension? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;threat&quot; was tracked down and found to be the result of confusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it wasn&#39;t. The people on the plane all say your article, which involves an alleged retraction of the story by a &quot;Mr. Bartlett&quot; and Dick Cheney, is wrong. The articles I linked also have <em>the notes taken on 9/11 by the people in charge</em>.</p>

<p>Your stupid article isn&#39;t even <em>internally consistent</em>, and it absolutely falls apart when we start looking at the evidence. Like I already explained, with direct citations. And for that reason I&#39;m reporting you for intentionally, willfully lying by denying proven facts without any basis, defending conspirators, and slapping multiple upvotes on this steaming pile of dogshit you&#39;re calling a comment, when older comments haven&#39;t been touched because the OP is over a day old (i.e. no one is reading this except you, me, and your phantom upvoters).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haven&#39;t you considered that this is intentional?  it&#39;s pretty easy to sort social network comments with relatively (i think) simple bots to determine general sentiment.  i&#39;m guessing a database of this kind of info is useful for whatever intel agencies have access to it.  </p>

<p>think of it as warfare.  intel on the enemy can go a long way.  and it seems calculated to me.  they know not everyone will automatically up and riot when these little &quot;mistakes&quot; are found, because the vast majority won&#39;t catch them at all, and by the time more observant people do, the psychological quirks and social dynamics they&#39;ve programmed into the minds of 95% of the public will do the rest of the work for them.  it&#39;s actually kind of fucking brilliant.  </p>

<p>from there, they can set up multiple levels of control.  we have the exact same biases, just on different levels, where we assume this youtuber isn&#39;t &quot;woke&quot; enough, but that youtuber is just batshit crazy.  but in reality, we have no fucking clue at all who&#39;s even close to the truth.  and then this dynamic gets used against us too, so we&#39;re irrevocably polarized and unable to work together.  </p>

<p>then throw in a bought off media, increasing infiltration of professional shills, a depressingly dumbed-down and weakened youth, etc.  looks bleak.  wish we had a decent plan and good leadership.</p>

<p>Depending on whether you think this was a deep state/military/Cheney coup, a preventable event that bush let happen, or bin laden was working for the cia, it implies very different possible timelines. This is especially true when we recall that bin laden allegedly orchestrated the WTC attack in 1997 and Bush saw a Presidential Daily Briefing in the summer of 2001 that explicitly warned of an attack from bin laden. </p>

Why would they need to give out this forewarning?<br/>
If, as you say, all three buildings came down via controlled demolition, why didn&#39;t they just blow up 7WTC when the other towers came down?
Instead they apparently let it burn for almost 7 hours before blowing it up, but not before forewarning news organisations that they were about to do so.. why?<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I ask myself the same question but that&#39;s clearly what happened. I don&#39;t think 7 was part of the plan at all, despite the fact it was rigged for demolition, how could they have planned it? And why did they choose to bring it down? I guess it was damaged enough that the explosives would have been been discovered during the clean up. Why were they there? Who knows, but they clearly were. I guess it could be argued that the bringing down of 7, being a far more standard type demolition, was far easier to spot as such, which of course it is, and so it would make sense to put as much distance between it and any witnesses. Kind of a cluster fuck in my opinion, I&#39;ve had people argue, &quot;It can&#39;t have been controlled demolition, they&#39;d have never pulled it off&quot; My response is &quot;They didn&#39;t! It&#39;s right there!&quot; But people see a mixture of what they want and what they&#39;re told. Gonna be a while yet before people are disconnected enough from the event to see the truth of it, when they do they&#39;re gonna look at us as some real dumb asses for not being able to see it though.</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s not.

<p>&quot;[..] skeptics often make <strong>legitimate probability arguments</strong>, and these can falsely be dismissed as arguments from incredulity. We certainly also ridicule absurd propositions – but again this is not fallacious as long as independent justification is offered.[..]  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Granted there are many assumptions in any estimation of the probability of pulling off an elaborate conspiracy without getting caught. But logical inferences can be made to create a valid argument that the scope and complexity of 9/11 is such that the odds of carrying it out without getting caught are vanishingly small. As long as the inferences are based upon the best available evidence and are reasonable, the conclusion can be valid and reliable. The key is that the judgment is not based upon a dismissive characterization of absurdity, or on the inability to imagine how it could have been pulled off, but rather a reasonable assessment of what would have been required at minimum for such an operation to be successful.&quot;

<p>Not a critical or even contributory factor to the collapse of WTC7 according to the official conclusions, as you&#39;d know if you&#39;d read the official report and weren&#39;t trying to obfuscate its manifest failure to explain what actually happened to the casual reader.</p>

<p><a href="http://911blogger.com/node/20469">Frank Greening&#39;s scientific illieracy has been utterly and painfully exposed in debate with a high school physics teacher.</a></p>

<p>Even if that were not the case, it would not alter the fact that your original claim for the source of the sulfur, though coming from an article published a &quot;skeptical&quot; organisation, does not withstand a moment&#39;s genuinely skeptical or critical thought: it is, in fact, the antithesis of skepticism, or an example of skeptopathy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paper walls and firecrackers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Returning to lessons of the high school physics teacher who humiliated Frank Greening: please learn that <a href="https://youtu.be/nUDoGuLpirc">observation is the starting point in science</a>.</p>

<p>While paper walls and firecrackers may seem risible to you (and it doesn&#39;t surprise me in least that you&#39;re trying to hand-wave them away), the effect in experimental terms is far more demonstrative than anything the greatest minds in physics and structural engineering have ever been able to offer after all these years. </p>

<p>In terms of actually demonstrating an experimental understanding of what happened to the towers, the &quot;official collapse theory&quot; is at this present moment, and is destined to always remain, completely and utterly without a shred of experimental, reproducible validation.</p>

<p>That is why it is accurate to call it pseudoscience and the cumulative proof some form of additional energy was present is becoming overwhelming.</p>

<p>In other words, 16 years after the most catatrophic structural disasters of all time, it remains the case that no-one can experimentally demonstrate a theoretical understanding of how those towers could possibly have collapsed with such incredible speed and destructive force, in either virtual or physical terms.</p>

<p>That is the whole point of Cole&#39;s experiments. He is only forced to improvise with firecrackers after exhaustively testing the official collapse theory with his backyard constructions and proving that, however much he tries, towers simply never collapse that way without an additional source of energy other than gravity.</p>

<p>That&#39;s Newton&#39;s Laws for you.</p>

<p>&quot;FACT: Many conspiracy theorists point to FEMA&#39;s preliminary report, which said there was relatively light damage to WTC 7 prior to its collapse. With the benefit of more time and resources, NIST researchers now support the working hypothesis that WTC 7 was far more compromised by falling debris than the FEMA report indicated. NIST (Sunder): &quot;The most important thing we found was that there was, in fact, physical damage to the south face of building 7.<br/>
On about a third of the face to the center and to the bottom—approximately 10 stories—about 25 percent of the depth of the building was scooped out.&quot; NIST also discovered previously undocumented damage to WTC 7&#39;s upper stories and its southwest corner.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah.. whatever. Since it &quot;does not withstand a moment&#39;s genuinely skeptical or critical thought&quot; I&#39;m sure you can easily refute the contents of the article, right? You know, with science, facts and logic, and without the ad hominem?</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The only thing Cole&#39;s backyard constructions prove is that they in fact do not behave like full size skyscrapers after being assaulted by an airliner and being subjected to a massive inferno. Who would have thought...  </p>

<p>Mr. Cole should perhaps go back to his high school physics teacher to brush up on his material science and scalability knowledge.</p>

<p>In reality, even though attempting to model the tower&#39;s collapse by use of physical models is a fool&#39;s errand, the <em>theoretical</em> understanding among structural engineers is generally well established.<br/>

<p>I easily refuted the article&#39;s claims about the the source of the sulfur. There was no ad hominem involved, but one does have to ask why a &quot;sceptical&quot; article would not itself ask the blindingly obvious question if it is really likely that such a common building material as gypsum would release such a dangerous chemical under conditions of fire, and instead stupidly assert the opposite.</p>

<p>Please note I included virtual modelling as well as physical modelling in my observation that Bazant et al, along with <em>every single structural engineer</em> you claim has a theoretical understanding of how the towers collapsed, has absolutely <strong>zero</strong> experimental, reproducible verification for their scientifically unsubstantiated ideas.</p>

<p>Indeed. But the point stands, and it is disingenuous to dispute it in view of the fact I linked you to the primary source. The debris damage, according to NIST, was not a casual or critical factor in the collapse; NIST&#39;s contention is that office fires alone would still have caused the building to collapse.</p>

<p>This conclusion, of course, is based solely on a computer animation that has is impossible to verify because NIST will not release the input data for independent analysis and <a href="https://youtu.be/pmdcMb5D9gM">looks nothing like the event it purports to model</a>: so much for peer review. <a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/faqs-nist-wtc-7-investigation">NIST didn&#39;t examine a single piece of physical evidence actually from the building</a> in producing this pseudoscientific &quot;forensic&quot; conclusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as of yet nothing in the document I linked to has been refuted</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was literally my opening remark to you; it is disingenuous to pretend otherwise. To suggest that elemental sulfur or (even more improbably) sulfuric acid can be easily derived from gypsum aka drywall aka calcium sulfate under conditions of fire -- which is what your article says -- beggars belief; for the final time a material that is so potentially dangerous would never be used in modern construction, as drywall so commonly is, for painfully obvious reasons (except to the deeply unskeptical authors of the article you cited).</p>

<p>That fact can be inferred from just a few moments&#39; critical thought.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where did I call Feyman a fool?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are being disingenuous again. I offered you Feynmann&#39;s famous quote because the position you have adopted does not agree with physical experiment. Every tower collapse experiment, whether physical or virtual (if the virtual environment has a reasonably accurate physics engine, like Blender for example) does not agree with you. You, Bazant, and however many structural engineers or other authorities you may wish to appeal to have nothing, I repeat <em>nothing to support your claims in terms of experimental verification</em>, the fundamental element of the scientific method.</p>

<p>And that is after 16 years of trying or, even more significantly, failing to honestly address this absolute scientific necessity, just as you are so disingenuously doing now.</p>

<p>Newton&#39;s Laws are Laws because towers -- whether experimental or otherwise -- never, ever collapse in the way we witnessed on 9/11 without a vast amount of energy in addition to gravity. [There is an entire subreddit dedicated to collating the research that proves this point](r/towerchallenge). </p>

<p>In short, in Feynmann&#39;s terms, you are wrong. You know your are wrong because not only do you disingenuously misrepresent Feynmann&#39;s point, but you disingenuously misrepresent the point I was making by linking to those YouTube videos of huge, physical structures that were designed to test earthquake resistance. </p>

<p>I was of course not suggesting that these structures were in themselves tower collapse experiments intended to test the scientifically unsupportable position with respect to tower collapses that you have so dogmatically adopted, but was making the point that structural engineers do actually conduct very large scale physical experiments to establish facts about how structures behave.</p>

<p>This was in in response to your claim that scale (by which I assumed you meant the square cube law, and probably static vs dynamic momentum) makes the experimental investigative effort a &quot;fool&#39;s errand&quot;.</p>

<p>To make that statement is indeed to call Feynmann and all those who subscribe to the foundational importance of experiment to the scientific method foolish, and this would include a fundamental misunderstanding or disingenuous misrepresentation of Jon Cole&#39;s experiments also.</p>

<p>As usual you are handwaving away the meaningful yet relatively easily understood criticisms of Bazant because you are simply incapable of addressing their substance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greening is an odd and unreliable source to cite as I have pointed out. He was <a href="http://911blogger.com/node/20469">schooled in elementary physics and humiliated himself</a> in an exchange with David Chandler in June of 2009 when attempting to defend the official tower collapse, and by December of 2013 was <a href="https://kevinbarrett.heresycentral.com/2013/12/frank-greening-bbc-mischaracterized-me-i-do-not-believe-the-official-story-of-wtc-7/">loudly pronouncing that he did not believe in the official explanation for the collapse of WTC7</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps, unlike you, he is a believer in science who is prepared to accept he is wrong. He <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/the911forum/withering-critique-of-the-new-wtc7-report-t44.html">left Korol&#39;s team that produced those two peer-reviewed papers</a> you continue to desperately avoid addressing after asking for them but was credited for his work on them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Greening is not so unwise as Dave Thomas as to confidently posit the origin of the sulfur as gypsum for reasons I have already explained exhaustively, perhaps because his area of expertise is in fact chemistry and obviously not even elementary physics. He says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the maximum concentration of SO2 from the decomposition of gypsum was 12 grams / m3, equivalent to 0.42 vol % SO2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>even if the conditions for this decomposition could have been achieved in the rubble pile, and his only conclusion is to recommend further tests to see if indeed this could possibly have occurred.</p>

<p>You&#39;re being totally disingenuous as I&#39;ve already pointed out. What experiment do you think is in question here? My point has consistently been that, as much as you may mock Jon Cole&#39;s experiments and by extension call Feynman an idiot for asserting the primacy of experiment as the arbiter of scientific truth, <em>all the tower collapse experiments that have ever been done</em>, whether virtual or physical, disagree with you.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve already said, and as you continue to disingenuously ignore, there is an entire subreddit dedicated to collating the experimental evidence that proves this point at r/towerchallenge.</p>

<p>Can you point to one verifiable tower collapse experiment that reproducibly demonstrates an understanding of the mechanic that caused the twin towers to be so rapidly and totally destroyed? You can&#39;t, because every experiment disagrees with you. That&#39;s why you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p>Or please, propose the kind of experiment you think would demonstrate how gravity blew the towers up. We&#39;ve only been waiting 16 years so far.</p>

It would require me to write a novel to adequately answer every single issue.  </p>

It is my personal conviction that most, if not all, of it has been debunked/properly explained by solid science and/or rational thinking.<br/>
At this point - 16+ years later - this whole &#39;9/11 truth&#39; movement really is just beating a dead horse (again - in my opinion).<br/>
What continues to fascinate and baffle me is how so many people apparently remain resistant to reason and are unwilling to change their view when confronted with facts that counter their &#39;belief&#39;.<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure several of the prominent &#39;truthers&#39; are in it for the attention (and perhaps money). Many are simply being contrary for the sole purpose of being contrary.

<p>Having said that, it&#39;s not my intention to change your view.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t consider the possibility that 9/11 was a false flag until about 7 years ago. Since then I&#39;ve met a number of people who share my opinion that it was and none of them fit any of the psychological profiles you suggested, except maybe a distrust of, or rather a willingness to question authority figures. One thing they do have in common is they are  fairly quiet on the subject, because frankly there is nothing remotely inviting about holding this opinion. Personally I do speak out on it quite openly and apart from the fact that it is a subject that gives most licence to be offensive, I find it surprising how many accept the official explanation without ever having questioned it.</p>

<p>You say you&#39;ll be happy to address any single point. I can think of three that I&#39;d like to discuss, if that&#39;s alright.</p>

<p>You suggest each point of the false flag argument has been debunked, but I think you mean to say that each point has been given an opposing explanation. For example the question of squibs exploding ahead of the wave of collapsing debris. The debunkers explanation is that that is air being expelled from ventilation shafts. Fine, ok, maybe it is, but it could also be squibs, we simply don&#39;t know, right? My point is that in the case of building 7, that being the strongest example in the argument for it being a false flag event, we have two opposing arguments. One being that it came down as a result of fire. Well FEMA looked at the case of building 7, and in their own words, their best fire based hypothesis &quot;has only a low probability of occurrence.&quot; Consider that along with the fact that the official explanation for the collapse of 7 is not fully available to the public, because it &quot;could jeopardize public safety&quot; and you have reason to question what you are being told. Consider that along with the fact that their is no historical precedence for such a collapse occurring outside a controlled demolition scenario, and yet the collapse fits the description of controlled demolition perfectly, and you have all the reason you need to consider that as the likely explanation. It is basic common sense. </p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D7Rm6ZFROmc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D7Rm6ZFROmc</a></p>

<p>Please also address the question of Norman Minetta&#39;s description of the events leading up to the strike on the Pentagon. I wish I could supply a link but I&#39;m in China during Spring Festival, YouTube is inaccessible right now. But you can easily find it if you search, &#39;Norman Minetta describes the strike on the Pentagon&#39;. I&#39;m sure that will do it.</p>

<p>Finally the fact of Operation Northwood. Albeit a previous government considered these plans, but it was only Kennedy that said no. And Bush was no Kennedy. Who is to say that such an idea did not arise again? It would fit the suggestion made by the PNAC. And if it did, do you think Bush would be the one with the moral fortitude to resist it? We don&#39;t know, but in light of the fact that such plans were made under a recent government, people do not simply have a right but a duty to question vigorously the possibility that they would consider such an action again.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll agree the 7 WTC collapse did indeed fit the description of controlled demolition. (Although I&#39;d argue &#39;perfectly&#39; is exaggerating it.) I too remember watching the documentary with demolition expert Danny Jawenko and thinking &#39;wow.. if a guy who does demolitions on a daily basis thinks it&#39;s CD, could there truth to it after all?&#39;<br/>
For me it was the trigger to start digging deeper and start reading lots (and lots and lots) about 9/11.
Long story short; Do I believe it <em>looked</em> like CD, yeah, sure. Do I think it is a likely explanation? No, I do not.
The absence of any evidence of explosives, or explosions, or witnesses, or whistle blowers or a feasible covert demolition scenario, or a &#39;smoking gun&#39; if you will, leads me to believe the controlled demolition hypothesis holds no water.
I do however believe the exact cause of the collapse (the collapse initiation event) is still unknown/disputed, and I <em>do</em> think this deserves further scientific research, if only to possibly improve building safety. </p>

<p>To illustrate, a snippet from someone who was actually there:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Early on the afternoon of September 11th 2001, following the collapse of WTC 1 &amp; 2, I feared a collapse of WTC 7 (as did many on my staff).</p>

<p>The reasons are as follows:</p>

<p>1 - Although prior to that day high-rise structures had never collapsed, The collapse of WTC 1 &amp; 2 showed that certain high-rise structures subjected to damage from impact and from fire will collapse.<br/>
2. The collapse of WTC 1 damaged portions of the lower floors of WTC 7.<br/>
3. WTC 7, we knew, was built on a small number of large columns providing an open Atrium on the lower levels.<br/>
4. numerous fires on many floors of WTC 7 burned without sufficient water supply to attack them.</p>

<p>For these reasons I made the decision (without consulting the owner, the mayor or anyone else - as ranking fire officer, that decision was my responsibility) to clear a collapse zone surrounding the building and to stop all activity within that zone. Approximately three hours after that order was given, WTC 7 collapsed. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories abound and I believe firmly that all of them are without merit.</p>

<p>Is he lying? Is he (and many of his staff) &#39;in on it&#39;?
I&#39;d say, very very very unlikely.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Regarding Norman Mineta, I feel it&#39;s best explained <a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php?title=Norman_Mineta">here</a>. (Warning: long)</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>As for Operation Northwoods; A proven conspiracy I suppose.<br/>
My stance on it is that the US military/intel organisations has probably hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people in tactical positions who do nothing but come up with all sorts of scenarios from mundane to inconceivably bizarre all the time.<br/>
But let&#39;s suppose someone had come up to president Bush or someone in his inner circle with a proposal to mass murder/false flag his own civilian population to further their agenda (assuming a proposal like that would ever get that far up the chain of command) would it be conceivable that they&#39;d say &#39;Yeah sure, let&#39;s do that.&#39;?<br/>
In some dystopian society, maybe. In reality, I&#39;d say &#39;No way&#39;.
But even if that happened - much like I really would like Bigfoot to exist, but the other way around I guess - I&#39;d need to see some solid evidence before I believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Operation Northwood wasn&#39;t just some radical, spitballed idea that had slipped through the cracks of a thousand more sensible ones, it was a finished, fully formulated proposal, accepted in entirety by the joint chiefs of staff. It was only Kennedy who said no to it. And that link on the Minetta testimony - did you read it? I wouldn&#39;t blame you if you didn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t read it all. I scanned and read what seemed relevant passages for 20 minutes, and I found nothing that shone a different light on Minetta&#39;s description of the events leading up to the Pentagon strike. In fact it didn&#39;t even seem to clarify what &#39;the orders&#39; were. Suffice to say, in light of the fact that Cheney was clearly aware of the incoming strike on the Pentagon, and that the orders went ahead as intended, the natural assumption would be that those orders were to stand down.</p>

<p>On the subject of witnesses giving reports of explosions in WTC7: Barry Jennings, Deputy Director of the Emergency Services Department for the New York City Housing Authority and Michael Hess, New York’s corporation counsel, both reported multiple explosions inside WTC7. On several occasions, Jennings stated that an explosion trapped them in WTC Building 7, and that explosions occurred throughout the building until they were saved. Jennings died in August of 2008. No cause of death was given, no autopsy or death certificate has even been released, and no witnesses to his death have come forward. His family disappeared at the same time. Two days after his death, the release of the NIST Final Report on the collapse of WTC7 claimed that there were no witnesses to explosions in building 7. Hess has since refused to comment further on the subject.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that the fire chiefs were in on anything, but there are questions about where the suggestions of the collapses of all three buildings actually originated.</p>

<p>In the FDNY oral histories, FDNY Chief Peruggia is recorded as saying, “I was in a discussion with Mr. Rotanz and I believe it was a representative from the Department of Buildings, but I&#39;m not sure. Some engineer type person, and several of us were huddled talking in the lobby and it was brought to my attention, it was believed that the structural damage that was suffered to the towers was quite significant and they were very confident that the building&#39;s stability was compromised and they felt that the north tower was in danger of a near imminent collapse.&quot;</p>

<p>In a 2008 discussion with Shayam Sunder from NIST, he is quoted as saying, &quot;.....there was a technical advisor or engineer who was called by, who was providing advice on 9/11 about the condition of buildings, and particularly building 7, and it was his judgment that he was hearing creaking sounds..........And he of course was observing the fires of the building as well, so based on that advice, the fire department decided around 2.30 that afternoon to stop fighting the fires in that building.</p>

<p>FDNY Chief Hayden, in the BBC&#39;s 2008 special &#39;The Conspiracy Files&#39; spoke of WTC7 saying, &quot;We were concerned of the possibility of collapse of the building, and we had a discussion with one particular engineer there, and we asked him, &#39;If we allowed it to burn, could we anticipate a collapse, and if so, how soon?&#39; And it turns out he was pretty much right on the money, that he said, &#39;In its current state, you have about five hours&#39;.</p>

<p>So it would seem the root of these predictions for buildings 1, 2 and 7 lie with this engineer. I have searched extensively and found no record of who this person is. So, who knows, maybe this person was in the know and spreading the collapse idea erroneously. To me that is more feasible than those three collapses occurring without the use of explosives. That is too far a stretch.</p>

<p>If you read the actual full-text proposal you&#39;ll see that most of it consists of &#39;simulated&#39; casualties. (Example; take a scheduled flight to Trinidad, pretend it&#39;s loaded with a group of college students, covertly land plane and swap it for identical &#39;drone aircraft&#39;, blow up drone after transmitting fake may-day, blame Cuba, profit). Now I&#39;m not in any way trying to justify/condone the operation, but compared to a mass-murder-of-US-civilians false flag scenario it&#39;s not even remotely in the same ballpark.<br/>
As the saying goes; Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. So far this evidence has, in my opinion, been sorely lacking.  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that link on the Minetta testimony - did you read it?  </p>

<p>No. Like you I scanned it and came to a similar conclusion as you did;  &#39;The order&#39;, and the timeline of events, are unclear.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the natural assumption would be that those orders were to stand down.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s where I disagree. Mineta himself inferred that &#39;the order&#39; referred to having the plane shot down. Critics have suggested that they could have been orders <em>not</em> to have the plane shot down.<br/>
&#39;The order&#39; <em>could</em> have been something else entirely. I&#39;d say it&#39;s pure speculation to <em>assume</em> anything at this point.  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hess has since refused to comment further on the subject.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually he has commented: &quot;[..] he is now certain that he did not hear an explosion. He just assumed on the day it could have been an explosion because he had witnessed the lights going out, the staircase filling with smoke and the building shaking vigorously.&quot; (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/10/caught_up_in_a_conspiracy_theo.html">Source</a>)<br/>
Also, the NIST Final 7WTC report was releases in late november 2008, not 2 days after Jennings death.<br/>
If you look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO5V2CJpzI">original Barry Jennings interview footage</a> would you think it reasonable to assume that what where he thought to have heard an explosion it was in fact &quot;likely that this was when Tower 1 collapsed, showering debris onto Tower 7&quot;?  (From source above)</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s in fact very likely to be different engineers. First responder teams for major disasters in urban areas are composed of firefighters, police officers, medical personnel, and structural engineers (according to FEMA/1999).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, this is pretty unambiguous:</p>

<p>&#39;The plans detailed in the document included the possible assassination of Cuban émigrés, sinking boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas, hijacking planes, blowing up a U.S. ship, and orchestrating violent terrorism in U.S. cities&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;To this end, Operation Northwoods proposals recommended hijackings and bombings&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;real or simulated actions against various U.S. military and civilian targets&#39;</p>

<p>They planned to murder people, plain and simple. This is not a point of discussion, it is a point of fact. Don&#39;t try to shine a nice light on their plans and suggest they&#39;d only have murdered a few people, not lots of murder, just a little murder, just enough to start a war so they could do the good, acceptable kind of murder. C&#39;mon. I simply raise the point of Operation Northwood to illustrate the fact that the truth movement, right or wrong, is wholly justified in its doubts and is asking questions that deserve to be asked. For example if there is nothing to hide why don&#39;t NIST do the tests for explosive residue and shut the truthers up once and for all?</p>

<p>Minetta, sure, ok, we don&#39;t know what the orders were, but still, they clearly knew there was an incoming plane. I can understand not wanting to shoot down a passenger plane but why not evacuate the building, they had plenty of time? Many people were killed needlessly. Or were a few deaths necessary? You see my point, right? The reality of Operation Northwood makes these reasonable suspicions.</p>

<p>So Hess changed his claim to having heard explosions, what about Jennings? You say he heard the collapsing debris from the second tower. Maybe, but his claim gives cause to consider the possibility. If I could access YouTube I would provide links to videos of explosions possibly coming from building seven, I know I have seen at least one. You can find them easily. That you can cast doubts on these quotes and videos being proof is not the point, they are reason enough to consider the possibility.</p>

<p>Here is another quote I came across. I tried to check it with Snopes but the connection repeatedly fails, I apologize, my hands are somewhat tied checking such things here in China, so much is unavailable, there&#39;s no Google for a start, you will have to check it yourself. Please let me know if it is authentic.</p>

<p>Former NYPD officer Craig Bartmer was in the immediate vicinity of Building 7 before its collapse at approximately 5:20pm. “I walked around it (Building 7). I saw a hole. I didn’t see a hole bad enough to knock a building down, though,” said Bartmer. “Yeah there was definitely fire in the building, but I didn’t hear any… I didn’t hear any creaking, or… I didn’t hear any indication that it was going to come down. And all of a sudden the radios exploded and everyone started screaming ‘get away, get away, get away from it!’… It was at that moment… I looked up, and it was nothing I would ever imagine seeing in my life. The thing started pealing in on itself… Somebody grabbed my shoulder and I started running, and the shit’s hitting the ground behind me, and the whole time you’re hearing “boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.” I think I know an explosion when I hear it… Yeah it had some damage to it, but nothing like what they’re saying… Nothing to account for what we saw… I am shocked at the story we’ve heard about it to be quite honest.”</p>

<p>Like I said, not sure about that quote but I&#39;m not sure about a great deal regarding 9/11. My point is that neither should you be. You say you&#39;re not trying to change my mind, well I am not trying to change yours. Change it to what? Neither of us knows the truth. If the very people tasked with explaining the collapse of 1 and 2 admit they cannot do that, then who are we to say we know? We do not. But the very fact of that admission is all one needs to conclude there is cause for continued investigation.</p>

<p>For confirmation of this claim you may have to download the peer review paper, &#39;Fourteen Points of Agreement with Official Government Reports on the World Trade Center Destruction&#39;. You will find the passage under point 13: NIST: “This letter is in response to your April 12, 2007 request for correction… we are unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse&quot;.</p>

<p>Similarly I see no reason why I should accept the word of NIST when they say they have a complete explanation for the collapse of 7. Their explanation is not fully available to the public as they say it might &quot;jeopardize public safety&quot;. Why should I accept that? Eight stories in perfect freefall. The same speed as if those eight stories were made of rice paper. Such an anomaly demands more than a &#39;trust me, we&#39;ve got this&#39; explanation.</p>

<p>NIST’s final report on WTC 7 concluded that the never before observed “new phenomenon” of “thermal expansion” was to blame for the destruction of the building, yet if the collapse of WTC 7 came as a result of a “new phenomenon” and an “extraordinary event” that had never happened before in the history of building collapses, then how did news stations and ground zero workers know it was going to happen hours in advance? That is my point about these remarkable engineers who recognized this new phenomenon, and in the case of building 7 did so five hours in advance, and yet received no recognition for it, but instead remain anonymous to this day. It&#39;s fishy.</p>

<p>Anyway, I reckon we&#39;re done, eh? I&#39;ll read any reply you make to this but we&#39;re going round in circles. Thanks for keeping it civil. All the best to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not arguing that the US government would be incapable of doing despicable deeds. There&#39;s ample historical proof of the contrary. (Which is why I added &quot;I&#39;m not in any way trying to justify/condone the operation&quot;)
Suspicion alone is however no grounds for conviction, especially when the charge is mass-murder on your own civilian population.  But yes, I get the point you&#39;re making.</p>

<p>You say the truth movement, right or wrong, is wholly justified in its doubts and is asking questions that deserve to be asked.<br/>
Well I&#39;d argue that most questions <em>have</em> been asked and for many people these questions <em>have</em> been adequately answered.
That&#39;s what the whole &#39;9/11 commission&#39; and related investigations were set up to do.<br/>
Your example, why don&#39;t NIST do the tests for explosive residue, is (in my opinion) sufficiently answered in their <a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/faqs-nist-wtc-towers-investigation">FAQ</a> (see point 22).  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can understand not wanting to shoot down a passenger plane but why not evacuate the building, they had plenty of time?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the artile I linked to earlier several conflicting reports raise serious doubts about Minetta&#39;s timeline, which would mean the conversation he overheard couldn&#39;t have been about Flight 77, which had (allegedly) already crashed into the pentagon.  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That you can cast doubts on these quotes and videos being proof is not the point, they are reason enough to consider the possibility.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The possibility <em>has</em> been considered and, based on scientific research and many eyewitness reports, has been dismissed.<br/>
Do I believe officer Bartmer is convinced he heard explosions? Sure.
Do I believe what he heard were controlled demolition charges going off? No I do not. There are simply too many reports conflicting with his.<br/>
A (again, in my opion) good analysis/summary can be found here:<br/>
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wtc7lies/whattheyheard">Did eyewitnesses report hearing or seeing bombs and
demolitions explosives in and around the towers?</a></p>

[..]You will find the passage under point 13: NIST:[..]  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.911proof.com/NIST.pdf">letter</a> (sorry, I could only find PDF), you can see that NIST is actually being quote mined here. Relevant bit;  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The final section of your request asserts that the WTC Report’s stated goal and overal analysis violates the Data Quality Act and OMB/NIST Information Quality Standards. The basis given for this assertion is that NIST did not fulfill its responsibilities under the NCST Act because the focus of the investigation was on the sequence of events from the instant of aircraft impact to the initiation of collapse for each tower. The NCST Act, as you note in your letter, requires NIST to “establish the likely technical cause or causes of the building failure.” In the case of the WTC Towers, NIST has established that the failures initiated in the floors affected by the aircraft impact damage and the ensuing fires resulted in the collapse of the towers. This conclusion is supported by a large body of visual evidence collected by NIST. Your letter suggests that NIST should have used computer models to analyze the collapse of the towers. <strong>NIST carried its analysis to the point where the buildings reached global instability. At this point, because of the magnitude of the deflections and the number of failures occuring, the computer models are not able to converge on a solution.</strong></p>

<p>Your letter contends that NIST’s report violates the Information Quality Standard of “utility.” NIST believes that the report has utility. In fact, the codes and standards bodies are already taking actions to improve building and fire codes and standards based on the findings of the WTC Investigation. As we mentioned previously, we are unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In short; They explained in detail <em>why</em> the towers collapsed (reached global instability) but were unable to model the collapses themselves because the computers were (and I&#39;m relatively sure still aren&#39;t) capable of properly simulating an event of this complexity (comparable to why we can&#39;t perfectly predict next week&#39;s weather).  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Regarding complete explanation for the collapse of 7;
Good summary here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/294k95/compilation_of_scientific_literature_that/">Compilation of Scientific Literature that Directly Cites to and Support&#39;s NIST&#39;s WTC 7 report&#39;s methodologies and conclusions</a>
To be fair I must however note that since that post was written there have in fact been legitimate questions raised about the NIST 7WTC research (details <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-uaf-study-shows-wtc7-could-not-have-collapsed-from-fire.t9056/">here</a>), and that deserves proper research in relation to building safety.
You&#39;ll find, however, that any indication of controlled demolition is completely absent in <em>any</em> scientific literature.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their explanation is not fully available to the public as they say it might &quot;jeopardize public safety&quot;.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the court proceedings available in the summary I linked to above:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judge C. KOLLAR-KOTELLY:
Reduced to layman&#39;s terms, the difference between the information that was released and the information that was withheld is that the released data files contain structural models based on information generally available to building designers and engineers, whereas the withheld data files contain information that could be used to predict the collapse of a building and, <strong>if made available</strong> to a person with the appropriate level of expertise, <strong>would provide instruction</strong> to individuals wanting to learn how to simulate building collapses and <strong>how to most effectively destroy large buildings</strong>.</p>

<p>This explanation for non-disclosure is sufficiently &quot;logical&quot; or &quot;plausible&quot; to satisfy NIST&#39;s burden of justifying its withholdings, … and NIST has, moreover, explained in a &quot;relatively detailed&quot; manner why the exemption is relevant in this context and has appropriately correlated the exemption with the pertinent records, … In short, NIST has provided an adequate explanation of, and justification for, its withholding decisions.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Makes sense to me.<br/>
Also, as a side note, when the &#39;truth movement&#39; is so unsatisfied with &#39;the official story&#39;, why don&#39;t they - instead of just &#39;asking questions&#39; - get their hundreds of architects and engineers together and do their own research once and for all confirming their  &quot;massive evidence for explosive demolition&quot; claim? There is plenty of public data to do so. Blueprints of the building(s), for example, are freely available. If I were a conspiracy minded person I might think that in reality they are perfectly happy with the manufactured controversy status quo. I doubt there&#39;d be any profitable ad/booksale/conference revenue when their own research might also conclude that in fact there is no explosive demolition evidence.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how did news stations and ground zero workers know it was going to happen hours in advance?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t - the first responders <em>assumed</em> this (because - as you mentioned before - they heard the building creaking, among other indications) and Reuters apparently just passed on false info from a local news station:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;On 11 September 2001 Reuters incorrectly reported that one of the buildings at the New York World Trade Center, 7WTC, had collapsed before it actually did. The report was picked up from a local news story and was withdrawn as soon as it emerged that the building had not fallen.&quot; (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/07/controversy_conspiracies_iii.html">Source</a>)  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In regards to the engineers receiving no recognition and remaining anonymous bit; Apparently to facilitate interviews with New York City first responders, the (9/11) Commission entered into an agreement with the City to keep the interviews confidential for a period of at least 25 years. (<a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/9-11/faqs.html">Source</a>)</p>

<p>Anyway, in conclusion; You say you&#39;re not sure about a great deal regarding 9/11 and neither should I be. Call me naive, arrogant or biased, but I <em>am</em> in fact sure about a great deal.<br/>
Not because I read every single piece of the 16+ cubic metres of textual records produced by the 9/11 commision. I didn&#39;t. I only read a tiny fraction. Not because I&#39;m a civil engineering expert. I&#39;m not.
I do however have a science background and after doing a lot of reading I&#39;ve concluded, partly based on expert opinions and partly on logical reasoning, that there is absolutely no evidence supporting either LIHOP nor MIHOP claims (ie. &#39;they&#39; Let vs &#39;they&#39; Made It Happen On Purpose).<br/>
The whole thing still fascinates me though (which is part of the reason I lurk around the conspiracy sub semi-regularly).<br/>
Apparently almost 55% of americans believe 9/11 conspiracy theories (<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/half-of-americans-believe-911-conspiracy-theories_us_5804ec04e4b0e8c198a92df3">Source</a>).<br/>
So I guess you&#39;re in good company!
I wish you all the best too. Good luck conquering that chinese firewall ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a third plane was supposed to hit 7. Ten planes were reported as off course and non-responsive that day.  Then there would have been no problem. But that one didn’t execute, perhaps, so they sprung into damage control. It was so implausible that 7 would collapse at that point because no plane did it. If it just collapsed straight up there would have been a lot of questions. But because “there were reports from the ground that it had collapsed or was about to collapse”, there’s no reason to ask questions. People say “What do you mean it was unlikely to collapse!? The firefighters said it was probably going to collapse before it did. Nothing to see here.”</p>

<p>The problem of course is why we’re these firefighters willing to stake their credibility on the claim that an physical impossibility was about to occur, namely a steel-frame building collapsing symmetrically and at free fall from a relatively tiny office fire with no plane and no jet fuel involved?  Other buildings took more damage but were not mentioned as collapse-risks. </p>

<p>I don’t mean to suggest direct, malicious involvement on the part of firefighters or first responders.  I think a couple were given news of an immensely collapse from probably the same source that gave the news to CNN. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the plan went south, and in the midst of chaos they quickly concocted a backup plan to rig the building with undetectable(?) explosives, a process that under normal circumstances would take months, <em>while</em> firefighters were searching the inside of the building and were busy putting out fires?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still doesn&#39;t make sense to me though. If the towers weren&#39;t supposed to have come down, how were they going to explain the 7WTC collapse? The main thing in my opinion that lends credibility to building 7 collapsing in the first place is the structural damage sustained by the tower collapse.<br/>
Also I find it rather incredible that the entire 9/11 incident would simply be a ruse to get to destroy the 7WTC building.<br/>
Why would it need to be destroyed? What was so special about this building that, assuming some of the contents of it needed to be destroyed, these contents couldn&#39;t be destroyed by conventional means and would require a mass murder of unprecedented proportion and covert demolition scheme with undetectable explosives?  </p>

<p>From the same page you linked to : &quot;The debris impact damage did play a secondary role in the last stages of the collapse sequence, where the exterior façade buckled at the lower floors where the impact damage was located</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed. But the point stands, and it is disingenuous to dispute it in view of the fact I linked you to the primary source. The debris damage, according to NIST, was not a casual or critical factor in the collapse; NIST&#39;s contention is that office fires alone would still have caused the building to collapse.</p>

<p>This conclusion, of course, is based solely on a computer animation that has is impossible to verify because NIST will not release the input data for independent analysis and <a href="https://youtu.be/pmdcMb5D9gM">looks nothing like the event it purports to model</a>: so much for peer review. <a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/faqs-nist-wtc-7-investigation">NIST didn&#39;t examine a single piece of physical evidence actually from the building</a> in producing this pseudoscientific &quot;forensic&quot; conclusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as of yet nothing in the document I linked to has been refuted</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was literally my opening remark to you; it is disingenuous to pretend otherwise. To suggest that elemental sulfur or (even more improbably) sulfuric acid can be easily derived from gypsum aka drywall aka calcium sulfate under conditions of fire -- which is what your article says -- beggars belief; for the final time a material that is so potentially dangerous would never be used in modern construction, as drywall so commonly is, for painfully obvious reasons (except to the deeply unskeptical authors of the article you cited).</p>

<p>That fact can be inferred from just a few moments&#39; critical thought.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where did I call Feyman a fool?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are being disingenuous again. I offered you Feynmann&#39;s famous quote because the position you have adopted does not agree with physical experiment. Every tower collapse experiment, whether physical or virtual (if the virtual environment has a reasonably accurate physics engine, like Blender for example) does not agree with you. You, Bazant, and however many structural engineers or other authorities you may wish to appeal to have nothing, I repeat <em>nothing to support your claims in terms of experimental verification</em>, the fundamental element of the scientific method.</p>

<p>And that is after 16 years of trying or, even more significantly, failing to honestly address this absolute scientific necessity, just as you are so disingenuously doing now.</p>

<p>Newton&#39;s Laws are Laws because towers -- whether experimental or otherwise -- never, ever collapse in the way we witnessed on 9/11 without a vast amount of energy in addition to gravity. [There is an entire subreddit dedicated to collating the research that proves this point](r/towerchallenge). </p>

<p>In short, in Feynmann&#39;s terms, you are wrong. You know your are wrong because not only do you disingenuously misrepresent Feynmann&#39;s point, but you disingenuously misrepresent the point I was making by linking to those YouTube videos of huge, physical structures that were designed to test earthquake resistance. </p>

<p>I was of course not suggesting that these structures were in themselves tower collapse experiments intended to test the scientifically unsupportable position with respect to tower collapses that you have so dogmatically adopted, but was making the point that structural engineers do actually conduct very large scale physical experiments to establish facts about how structures behave.</p>

<p>This was in in response to your claim that scale (by which I assumed you meant the square cube law, and probably static vs dynamic momentum) makes the experimental investigative effort a &quot;fool&#39;s errand&quot;.</p>

<p>To make that statement is indeed to call Feynmann and all those who subscribe to the foundational importance of experiment to the scientific method foolish, and this would include a fundamental misunderstanding or disingenuous misrepresentation of Jon Cole&#39;s experiments also.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish all those plenty critics best of luck getting their research findings through peer review and accepted by the general engineering community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As usual you are handwaving away the meaningful yet relatively easily understood criticisms of Bazant because you are simply incapable of addressing their substance.</p>

<p>However, if it is only peer-reviewed literature that will persuade you, you can <a href="http://www.challengejournal.com/index.php/cjsmec/article/view/36/19">start here</a> and <a href="http://www.challengejournal.com/index.php/cjsmec/article/view/50/41">here</a></p>

<p>Noting the many shortcomings in Bažant&#39;s analysis, which have been studied and criticized extensively since 2001, Korol and his colleagues set out to apply a much more rigorous methodology for analyzing WTC 7, which, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), collapsed from normal office fires.</p>

<p>Korol and his colleagues set out to apply a much more rigorous methodology for analyzing WTC 7.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert Korol, professor emeritus of civil engineering at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and a fellow of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering, has led a team of academic researchers in preparing two peer-reviewed scientific papers on the destruction of World Trade Center Building 7. Both papers were published in the Challenge Journal of Structural Mechanics — the first one in July 2015, the second in February 2016.</p>
