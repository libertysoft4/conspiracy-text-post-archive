And all were committed by something that is easy to obtain whether it&#39;s illegal, banned, or or otherwise. It&#39;s just another thing that gets placed on America&#39;s &quot;To Do&quot; list, and unless it&#39;s in the daily news it&#39;s forgotten. Maybe if addicts start overdosing 20-30 at a time inside schools, it would get a closer look. It&#39;s so easy to cast blame at guns or Trump or race, but the real problem is that people are fed up and shit is boiling over in all kinds of ugly ways. THEY have happily awaited this war WE have created. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>should we consider others feelings for all our actions? personal suffering is way more important than people grieving.</p>

<p>if people have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and they fill suicide would fill all those areas- I fully support them.</p>

<p>asking someone to suffer, whether emotionally, physically or any other way because it might upset others is immoral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said it was my thoughts. </p>

<p>And your trading 1 sufferer into 2 or 10. So now we have let’s say 5 suffers after the first killed them self.  So out of those 5 we can say 2 will kill them selves. Then there might be 13 people that are suffering and out of those 13 people maybe 5 kill them selves. </p>

<p>If suicide was legal and was not looked down on then you could have a run away issue where 1 could become 100’s.  </p>

<p>I am saying that suicide could be the answer for some people.  </p>

<p>You can also look at another thing that is really a solo thing. Why do we have seatbelt laws when the only person your hurting is yourself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure but those are less effective. Women attempt suicide at a higher rate than men but more men die of suicide. Why do you think that happens?

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree. I&#39;m a gun owner myself. I went through a long series of things to be able to own a handgun in CA, and eventually to concealed carry here in WA.  I can&#39;t imagine anyone getting around the system I had to go through (in CA and WA) any time I purchased a firearm through a dealer. That being said, if I wanted to obtain a firearm through the  black market for the purpose of committing a crime, I don&#39;t have to go through any checkpoints, nor any waiting periods.  I TOTALLY agree with waiting periods. If someone gets drunk, gets angry, and wants to kill...I don&#39;t want them to be able to buy a gun immediately. I agree with mental health checks against gun purchases...I mean, why the fuck wouldn&#39;t you check if someone is insane? Makes sense. But if sane people want to buy guns, there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s ever going to stop them completely. It&#39;s their Right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to point out that while it&#39;s certainly the most hyped up version of gun violence, comparing school shootings to every type of drug overdose seems dishonest.

Still not as many as there are drug overdoeses, but the number people should be concerned about is way higher than 7.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you re: discrimination of drug type. My anger comes at this. Only people who do not use guns think guns are the problem. If you are shoot skeet or hunt or have home protection &amp; you are trained then the last thing you think of when someone shoots up a school is &quot;gun control.&quot; If you are trained then your thought is if ONLY there had been a HEALTHY WELL TRAINED PERSON THERE WITH A FIREARM TO STOP THE INSANE PERSON.  So too with the &quot;opiate&quot; crisis. Only people who live a healthy, happy life without pain or being crippled thinks DOCTORS, PAIN PILLS when they hear &quot;overdose or opiate.&quot; If you yourself or someone you knows lives with chronic pain and takes their legitimate medications as prescribed thinks, &quot;my God why would someone shoot an unknown substance into their body for fun?&quot; I watched my old mother be forced off of 2 pills a day. a 7.5mg morning and a 7.5mg night dose of hydrocodone. She went from a high functioning, happy, babysitting granny to a bitter, depressed recluse. She has never watched television and she is now living her life by watching the lives of others on tv. She gets angry when I try to reason with her about going to a football game, &quot;NO! LEAVE ME ALONE! I AM NOT GOING TO GO BECAUSE I WILL BE UP ALL NIGHT WITH MY BACK SCREAMING...&quot; So I shush  my kids not to talk about the game until we are out the door. Now if one of you smarty pants with the doctors writing out prescriptions for 1000 pills a month can explain how my mother&#39;s 2 pills a day is HELPING A HEROIN ADDICT...i&#39;ll shut up and listen. The truth is that my mom&#39;s medication nor her doctor were harming anyone!!! LEAST OF ALL HER! She now lives with chronic pain and wishes to die. She tells me how all of her friends are dead so what is the point. 2 YEARS AGO SHE WOULD TELL ME ABOUT THE CAKE SHE WAS BAKING FOR HER BUNKO NIGHT!!!!! Dammit shame on all of you people! YOU HAVE CREATED AN UNTENABLE CONDITION FOR THOUSANDS OF PAIN PATIENTS AND FOR WHAT GOOD?!?!!? So you could proclaim loudly about those evil damn doctors and horrible monsters making pills? You are all idiots. YOU ARE ALL GLUED TO YOUR FUCKING TELEVISIONS EVERY NIGHT LISTENING TO THOSE TOOLS WHO MANIPULATE YOU INTO WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE BUYING NEXT MONTH OR NEXT YEAR AND ITS ALL A GAME TO ENRICH PEOPLE HELLA SMARTER THAN YOU!!!!! Just shut up. If you want to talk about the devastation of the true drug infestation then you should talk about the heroin of Appalachia or the crack/meth in the southern states or the cocain and ecstacy on the west coast BUT SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT PHYSICIANS AND THEIR EVIL LACKEY DRUG COMPANIES!!!! YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE FUCKING TALKING ABOUT!!!! Here is a little factoid for you... us veterans wth missing limbs suffer from excruciating phantom limb pain. With proper pain relief AND A DAY PROGRAM OF SPORTS AND SOCIAL INTERACTION they experience less pain AND THEY REBUILD PRODUCTIVE LIVES! For veterans receiving medication only they rebuild at high rates but in a much slower fashion. Veterans WITHOUT ACCESS TO PROPER PAIN RELIEF.....they have a dramatically higher use of ILLICIT DRUGS and rampant alcoholism and RARELY REBUILD and effective life. Do you guys ever think of those people as you scream your self important bullshit about &quot;THOSE CRAZY DOCTORS AND CRAZY PILL MANUFACTERERS AND THEIR CRAZY PILL POPPING PATIENTS...&quot; just shut the fuck up unless you have read the research, the government publications, and gone to a VA to see some of the great work that is now being done to help these guys. Programs like wounded warriors get them out into canoes and boats...4wheelers...setting up camp while sitting in their wheelchairs....AND YES! MANY OF THEM NEED THEIR PROPER DOSE OF MEDICATION SO THEY CAN DO THOSE THINGS!!!!!!!!! The goal is not &quot;get them off of their medications.&quot; The goal is GET THEM INVOLVED AND FUNCTIONING AGAIN BECAUSE THE MORE ACTIVE THEY ARE THE LESS MEDICATION THEY WILL NATURALLY USE!!!! AND THOSE STATISTICS ARE ROCK SOLID GOLDEN IN PEER REVIEWED ARTICLES!!!!! People who have rewarding careers and happy families do not lay around and say, &quot;Oh yay! Tomorrow I go to my crazy doctor and buy my pills from my crazy physician so I can be a crazy pill popping HAPPY PRODUCTIVE PARENT AND PROFESSIONAL!&quot; </p>

<p>WILL YOU GUYS JUST MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO BE RATIONAL IN YOUR QUESTION FOR VIRTUE? Instead of preaching, &quot;Weeeell what we need here is some good ole fashioned LAW MAKING!&quot; YUP....WITH MORE LAAAAWS WE&#39;LL HAVE LESS DEAD KIDS BY GOD!&quot; Here is some news for you.....THERE ARE ALREADY GODDAMN LAWS PEOPLE! IN FACT WE ARE SWIMMING IN SO MANY LAWS THAT EVEN THE SUPREME COURT CANT FIGURE OUT IF OBAMACARE IS LEGAL BECAUSE IT IS A TAX OR IF IT IS LEGAL BECAUSE IT IS NOT A TAX!!!!!!! </p>

<p>You want to know what would have saved those children &amp; 2 heroid men in Florida? I&#39;ll tell you. If that foster child&#39;s parent had not been using drugs or staying drunk during her pregnancy. I have a pretty good hypothesis he was  FES in addition to the autism. Because of ASD and FES he should have had a weekly meeting with a CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST biweekly and weekly contact with a counselor teaching social skills and coping behaviors. That should have been a regular part of elementary, junior, and high school. After the 2nd call to the police or the 1st evidence of animal mutilation HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MANDATED TO BIWEEKLY THERAPY WITH A LICENSED PSYCHOLOGIST...NOT A MASTER&#39;S LEVEL THERAPIST BUT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL! That psychologist then develops an effective treatment clan to include LPCs, occupational therapy, anger management, work study training, and social activities that are in vivo social skills training and coping behaviors use. The psychologist refers and follows the mental health medical treatment with psychiatry and/or pediatrics. When he became a young adult OR WHEN HIS MOTHER DIED he should have been moved to RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT where he lives in a real house with rules, chores, boardgame nights, movie nights, Christmas trees, Sunday at church with a couple of house mothers who are trained by professional therapists/psychologists. A licensed psychologist would be made available 24hrs 7 days a week for any unexpected events. Nikolaus should have been protected from himself and from the society that he was not equipped to understand or navigate successfully. Had he been protected from himself and society those kids and those brave men WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY!!!! So why wasn&#39;t Nikolaus receiving that level of care that could have overcome the negatives of FAS and ASD and would have allowed him to be a contributing (but still odd ) and safe member of society??? WELL BECAUSE OF CONGRESS! BECAUSE THE LOBBYISTTS AND MSM DO NOT TELL YOU ABOUT THOSE SERVICES!!! THERE IS NO MONEY IN GETTING KIDS LEGITIMATE HELP. they say, &quot;Hey! we send that kid a $700 check every month! why don&#39;t their parents take them for therapy? Weeeell mr smartpants politician wearing a sequined cowboy hat...that $700 pays for food and marijuana and beer for the fucked up, uneducated foster parent that you placed him with or let him be adopted by!!! BUT IF IT WAS RUN BY LICENSED PROFESSIONALS WITH KNOWLEDGE, ETHICS, CARE, AND INTELLIGENCE...and likely no sequined cowboy hats except at Halloween....THEN THE BOY MIGHT GROW UP TO BE MORE CAPABLE THAN THE FOSTER CARE/ADOPTIVE SYSTEM!!! The money is in something sexy or tragic. the money is freely given when what dies is a schoolful of potential rather than a little defenseless frog. AND YOU PEOPLE WITH ALL YOUR GOOD IDEAS ABOUT GUN LAWS...don&#39;t you think you sound more intelligent with rational common sense solutions that would parallel the way you run your own homes?</p>

<p>Look...if your child wrecks the family car and kills the family dog when he does it.... 14 yrs old and DRUNK...then what is your response? Your previous rules were 1. Be where you say you are going to be. 2. Always tell the truth.  then junior comes home smelling of alcohol one night so rule 3 is added. 3. No drinking alcohol until you are 21. so then junior comes home reeking of alcohol AND has a new pair of $400 shoes you did not buy. So rule number 4 is born. 4. No stealing. And then Junior comes in reeking of alcohol with hickies all over his stomach and back... uhm are you gonna go to NEW RULE JUNIOR! 5. NO SEX UNTIL WITHOUT A CONDOM.... at what rule do you stop to say, &quot;hmmmm y&#39;know..I&#39;m not sure junior even understands the concept of &#39;a rule.&#39;&quot; Because you have a whole shitload of RULEZ but not only is he BREAKING THE ESTABLISHED RULES BUT YOU HAVE TO ADD NEW RULES TO THE RULES HE IS ALREADY NOT FOLLOWING!!! At what point do you say, &quot;JUNIOR! YOU AINT GOING NOWHERE BUCKO! YOU ARE GONNA SIT IN THIS HOUSE SO I CAN SEE YOU ARE NOT DRINKING OR STEALING OR LYING OR FUCKING.....and &lt;deep calming breath&gt; you will be going to therapy weekly until you can figure out a better life than the current lying, stealing, drinking, fucking course you are currently on.&quot; Will Junior get shut down and into therapy at Rule #5 or Rule #25??? Because let me tell you this....at Rule#5 I can PROBABLY help ur kid BUT...YOU BRING mr bigshot bigballs you aint stopping me from nothing bitch into my office at Rule #25 ... my advice to you will be, &quot;strap in and get ready for a nightmare! Cause one way or the other this process is gonna be painful and long for ALL OF US!&quot; A child who is continually allowed to break the rules and invent new ones is a kid who has had the worst of his behavior REWARD (inadvertently) and REINFORCED FOR A LONG LONG TIME. Bad behavior and poor choices has become a habit for your kid. A child who is brought to therapy who has been allowed to reach rule #25 is a FAMILY PROBLEM THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED BEFORE I can do anything with the individual child.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their point is this seems a lot less like a genuine attempt to discuss an issue, and more of a defense against another, being the huge gun problem. 
The more people want to avoid it by pointing at other problems like Op has done, the easier it is to not talk about it properly. 
Even just making the comparison, opiate ODs kill more people than guns, is incredibly misleading and doesn&#39;t help make the issue or its resolution clearer.
There are just a lot more people taking opiates than there are people wanting to shoot up schools.
 That doesn&#39;t make the school shootings less of a problem, but it does make it sound easier for people like OP to distract. </p>

<p>To prevent pain and suffering, correct?</p>

<p>What if I told you there was something out there that caused more overall pain and suffering than school shootings and we were ignoring it? What if I told you that we could probably make more progress with this other thing given the measly effort we put into fixing guns? Because we&#39;ve had pretty common school shootings now for about ten years and every single time its the exact same public and political response. We aren&#39;t improving the quality of life on that front. We might be able to improve the quality of life for more people on the opiate/Big Pharma front. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes yes AND YES!!!!!</p>

<p>THANK YOU for some rational thought! I would upvote your comment 100x if I could. You are correct the problem is about mental health. You should expand your thoughts one step further. What has changed in the past 20 yrs that we see such a sharp decline in the overall general mental health of America now? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Internet expanded sphere of influence to young people for early exposure to sexual content in addition to sexual content that is extreme and others would define as out of the norm!</p></li>
<li><p>Television and Film aka Hollywood/NewYork ballooned into a vehicle for pushing and normalizing extreme behaviors. We are now in the midst of a push to make pedophilia &quot;normal.&quot; or just another sexual preference....as if somehow the child being victimized is an object and not a real live human being who is learning and evolving every moment and every experience.</p></li>
<li><p>A rapid increase in the use of alcohol. It has become such a normal expected part of daily life that people are actually in SHOCK when I explain I do not drink...anything...ever...not a drop. They say, &quot;oh you must be in recovery.&quot; And I say, &quot;No, I saw a brain that had been physically damaged by the alcoholic body is lived in for 40 years and I was HORRIFIED.&quot; The college kids are being decimated...wiped out by alcoholism but Hollywood makes movies that glorify alcohol use. They treat it like its marshmallows and hotdogs for summer camp...and IT IS KILLING YOUR COLLEGE STUDENT PEOPLE! I PROMISE YOUR CHILD AT COLLEGE IS DOING THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE YOU VOMIT. Our latest abomination was to have 3 students brought into the ER who had used an enama bag to poor EVERCLEAR LIQUOR into their intestines! One of those boys will have several surgeries to correct the damage. STOP FUCKING DRINKING IN FRONT OF YOUR FUCKING LITTLE CHILDREN YOU EMBECILES!!!! </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Okay. My post is finished for now. I&#39;m so furious by the insanity gripping this country. You idiots stay drunk and watch your insanity influences from Hollywood and then wonder why some poor foster kid (probably a drug baby) who was bullied horribly, fixated on the power of guns as portrayed in the movies, who was ridiculed because he asked for sex in the only way his autistic brain knew how to do it and had the only stable influence in his life die 3 months earlier BLOWS AWAY THE VERY PEOPLE HE BELIEVED CAUSED HIS PAIN!!!! Why did he think his pain originated in the school? Because he was AUTISTIC! If he was not experiencing it in the moment he did not think about it. At home with this mother he was happy with his guns and movies. At school he was laughed at and ridiculed, called names and his social confusion was excruciatingly painful. When his mother died his pain from that loss was conflated with the pain experienced in the school. In short...he held those kids responsible for ever bad thing in his life. AND THE FUCKING SHERIFF?!?!?! THAT IDIOT SHERIFF WHO IS SCREAMING POLITICAL SHIT ABOUT ELECTIONS AND GUN CONTROL?!?!!? ASK THAT BASTARD HOW MANY TIMES HIS OWN DEPUTIES WERE CALLED TO THAT HOUSE! ASK HOW MANY TIMES THE CITY POLICE WERE THERE! ASK IF THEY KNEW HE WAS MUTLATING ANIMALS!!!! AND THEN ASK THEM WHY THAT BOY WAS NOT TAKEN TO A RESIDENTIAL FACILITY FOR HIS OWN FUCKING SAFETY!!!!! WHY DONT YOU FUCKING PEOPLE ASK THOSE GODDAMNED QUESTIONS INSTEAD OF BITCHING ABOUT MORE FUCKING LAWS THAT DO NOTHING EXCEPT MAKE WASHINGTON RICHER AND MORE POWERFUL!!!!! DO THAT HOW ABOUT IT~!</p>

<p>I said what I said to show that you haven&#39;t thought critically about your views on government.  You lack the necessary nuance required to come to meaningful conclusions about how government should operate and what powers they should and should not have.  To you, &quot;they&quot; (as if the government is a single entity) are the enemy and should be dismantled.  Maybe try finding some sort of middle-ground in your views so you can stop sounding like an angsty teenager mad at the world.

    <div class="md"><p>Irresponsible patients do not equate to being murdered by a gunman.</p>

<p>A quick search and personal experience shows that 1-5mg hydrocodone lasts 3-4 hours or longer.  If you are taking more than this, you are being irresponsible with your prescription or you need to reevaluate treatment with your doctor.  Read the printout the pharmacy supplies that explains usage, side effects, drug interactions, and warnings.  Also a search on drugs.com will tell you specifically what drugs you are taking will interact adversely.  It&#39;s not rocket science.  </p>

<p>What are the overdose stats?  What dosages were these patients on?  Were they taking legally prescribed opiates?  Were they ingesting alcohol?  Were they mixing prescriptions that could cause death if taken together?  </p>

<p>No one shoves medication down a person&#39;s throat.  On the other hand, school shooters don&#39;t give choices to their victims.  So that&#39;s a apples to oranges comparison.</p>

<p>Also, manufacturers shouldn&#39;t be held responsible anyway.  Both guns and powerful prescription drugs should be regulated because they have the potential to have fatal effects if used incorrectly.  Hold consumers responsible by having them take a class.  God forbid people should be educated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no i do not.  maybe i&#39;m caught up in the semantics of this, but when you say &quot;the drug studies&quot; to me, it implies that pharmaceutical companies have a hand in all investigations of the drugs they produce.  there are thousands and thousands of articles published in the most prestigious scientific journals in the world that spell out plainly the negative consequences of all opioid classes of drugs, from the cellular level to the epidemiological level and everywhere in between.  no clinical trials data available refutes the widely held belief among the scientific and medical community that all opioids are addictive and should be prescribed sparingly.  the vast majority of medical practitioners know this and act accordingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, and that&#39;s a bad thing.  but it doesn&#39;t change that fact that the efficacy and safety of new drugs on the market are constantly being evaluated -- using opiates as an example, the suspect studies published by pharmaceutical companies are dwarfed in comparison to the scores of studies out there today that plainly spell out their potential danger, resulting in opiate prescriptions being harder to obtain.</p>

<p>Literally none of those things have happened with guns.

I’ve been to more than a few due to not having health insurance (and due to my stupid ass not staying clean, of course). They’re making it harder to get prescription opioids, that’s great, maybe that’ll prevent people from becoming addicts.

That may be school shooting deaths but total gun deaths this year is already 1800+ and this one incident yesterday more than doubled that 7 number. I agree something needs to be done about drugs but that does not discount the fact something needs to be done about the gun violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please do <em>not</em> wean yourself off without some sort of medical/psychiatric supervision, or you&#39;re gonna have a bad time.  Even a good general practice / family doc might not know how to deal with this, so a specialist would be best. </p>

<p>I&#39;m currently being weaned off of sertraline, and my family doc initially told me to just jump from 150mg/day to 100mg/day.  Needless to say, I had a bad time with the brain zaps. Currently going from 100 to 50, but this time I also got a script for the 25mg pills, which lets me bump things down by 12.5 every couple of weeks. It&#39;s going much much better. </p>

<p>One other thing I would suggest is to ask about other drug-classes to help ease the transition. Mood stabilizers and NDRIs can be really helpful and induce less physical dependency. </p>

<p>Again, <em>do not do this without medical/psychiatric supervision</em>. If your primary care doc doesn&#39;t want to help, see a psychiatrist for a pharmacology consult. That&#39;s what they do, and they know their shit. </p>

<p>Best of luck my dude(tte?).</p>

Saying drugs are less dangerous because they only affect the individual taking them ignores a whole host of factors. If they were less dangerous, why do they kill more people? Somewhere along the line people are supplying those individuals on a massive scale, fully aware of the dangers they impose.

<p>Yeah, let&#39;s look at Switzerland.
* About half as many guns per capita as the US
* Very different culture, people generally don&#39;t have guns &quot;for protection&quot;
* To buy a gun or ammunition you need a permit
* Carrying a loaded gun is illegal (both open and concealed carry)</p>

<p>The Swiss gun laws are much more restrictive than the laws in most US states. Most people asking for more gun control would be pretty happy with these laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which shows only one thing, increased prosperity.   Not to mention the fact that there were almost no mass shooters before the last 20 years, yet access to guns was ubiquitous.  You could buy them in a hardware store no questions asked.  High schools had shooting teams and firing ranges.  You could borrow a gun AT school and bring your own whenever you felt like it.   </p>

<p>If guns are the problem, why were they magically not a problem until the 21st century?</p>

<p>Our per capita number of cars has gone way up since then too, is there an emotionally charged political dialogue surrounding fatal road accidents which kill orders of magnitude more people than murderers who chose to use guns?  Is there an evergreen political dialogue around heart disease and death caused by putting sugar and corn syrup into every product in the supermarket, killing orders of magnitude more people than the combined total of every mass murderer in the US that ever chose a gun as his weapon in the entirety of history?</p>

<p>Homicide has declined significantly since 1968 alongside practically every other type of crime and the only underlying factor that correlates consistently with it is economic prosperity.  If guns are your target and statistics are your weapon, you&#39;ve picked up a venomous snake by the tail in a swordfight.  The health of society and the economy is the factor determining how much violence is directed at said society by its own citizens, not access to guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone takes driver&#39;s ed, and many states require a number of supervisory hours under a learner&#39;s permit before a full license is granted. You have your vision checked and take a driver&#39;s test before you&#39;re licensed, and the state can revoke your license if you have certain mental conditions, which they can learn about in a number of ways that don&#39;t require your consent. Your license gets revoked when you get too many points or commit certain offenses. Cars are strictly titled and ownership of every car is recorded with the state. Cars themselves are inspected annually and must contain certain safety features, like airbags, seat belts, backup cameras (in recent years), etc., and there are constantly new regulations being put in place as new technology becomes available which may make them safer (again, see backup cameras as an example).</p>

<p>Not to mention cars have significantly more utility than guns do. Most people commute with a car - I don&#39;t know of anyone who commutes with a gun. I can go get groceries with a car, but would starve to death in my city if I had to rely on a gun to hunt for my food. Those who do need guns for jobs generally do go through extensive checks, which I&#39;m cool with, but 99% of people have no need for a gun in their day-to-day life. And if you intend to hunt with a gun, you don&#39;t need to be able to fire multiple rounds per second, so at the very least the sorts of guns people have access to should be limited to <em>not</em> those that are basically only designed for warfare.</p>

<p>As are alcohol, tobacco, and food industries.  Doesn&#39;t matter: people are responsible for their own addictions.</p>

<p>Also the term fake news got implemented. It&#39;s to soften the tone of propaganda, which is literally fake news. Propaganda should be illegal, but since the average citizen is softened to &quot;fake news&quot; when they hear that anything is propaganda, they shrug it off. See my point? </p>

<p>It&#39;s not called cherry picking? Have you ever looked at the numbers?</p>

<p>And gun deaths is misleading. In 2016(?) there were 30,000 gun deaths, but 20,000 of those were suicides. Also, op is only talking about school shootings b/c of yesterday. So no, its not cherry picking to exclude mass shootings outside of schools if you are talking about schools shootings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the point is not valid. Even if you tried a better comparison which would be the amount of drug related deaths in schools versus gun related deaths in schools you still miss the most important factor. Gun deaths involve innocent bystanders, While drug overdoses involved participants who made a choice and by making that choice excepted a certain amount of risk.</p>

<p>I have no source, but i just find that so hard to believe, just in sheer numbers. </p>

<p>According to the census report for 2017 there were 74.6 MILLION students across america!!!!</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re right that in some places gun rights are unjustly restricted as a result of politicians taking the easy route of throwing out some &quot;feel good&quot; ineffective and inconvenience.</p>

<p>But the fact that tackling the mental health aspect is ignored doesn&#39;t logically imply that more restrictive gun laws will reduce avoidable gun deaths.</p>

<p>And you don&#39;t get to say what the effect of a law will be. You don&#39;t know because no one does. We can only make reasonable changes and see what happens. It&#39;s way too complex of a system to talk about how you are.</p>

<p>&quot;But they&#39;ll still get what they want&quot;
Yeah, alright. How is that going to work? Imagine an insane person.</p>

<p>They can either get the gun legally and easily for a fair cost or have to find a criminal contact who would sell them a gun for a big price increase.</p>

<p>Guns are not drugs. There is not nearly enough willing illegal gun users to support this idea that some random crazy guy could buy a gun as easily as some weed.</p>

<p>A national firearm registry already sort-of exists with the Federal Firearms Lisence that the federal government has. My father has one. These have extensive background checks as well as a monetary hurdle. I think we should instate a FOID card like system that Illinois has with Mandatory waiting periods for both firearms, ammunitio, and accessories. Make gun sellers hand over their buyers list and start soliciting people to enroll, fine them when they don&#39;t. Increase the fines stupidly, and garnish wages. They&#39;ll comply eventually. You&#39;re not removing their rights to own guns so they can&#39;t bitch about the second amendment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not perfect but I believe that we as a nation need to be more accountable and responsible when it comes to firearms. Mandatory education classes, education on fines and penalties for law breaking to everyone who purchases them.</p>

<p>Also we need better accountability to parents and their children. Obviously something was mentality wrong with the Florida shooter. Was anything done about it? We know he was reported multiple times to law enforcement and yet had guns. How did that happen? Where is HIS accountability as a person? As an adult, who votes in this country? How did he end up that way? Was he unable to afford care because sickness = bankruptcy in this country?</p>

<p>NIH said there is no evidence to suggest that those diagnosed with mental illness are any more dangerous than the general public.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is only for dealers, not for individual gun sales. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>What purpose does a waiting period serve?  At best, maybe someone is delayed long enough to change their mind about a shooting (though most of them plan it for months) and at worst, someone who needs it now will not be able to protect themselves because they were waiting. </p>

<p>Make gun sellers hand over their buyers list and start soliciting people to enroll, fine them when they don&#39;t. Increase the fines stupidly, and garnish wages. They&#39;ll comply eventually. You&#39;re not removing their rights to own guns so they can&#39;t bitch about the second amendment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Removing and infringing are two different words.  To infringe is to act so as to limit or undermine.  Waiting periods, mandatory registration and fines for non compliance wouldn&#39;t be an infringement? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also we need better accountability to parents and their children. Obviously something was mentality wrong with the Florida shooter. Was anything done about it? We know he was reported multiple times to law enforcement and yet had guns. How did that happen?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree.  Something was up and someone should have been able to see the signs.  I think it would be helpful for people to figure out what the signs are, so everyone knows what to look for. </p>

I don&#39;t even have a gun, but I&#39;m not about to tell people that they can&#39;t protect themselves from the violence that we all know exists out there in the world. People have a natural right to defend themselves from aggression. There are also some good arguments that the social contract with government can only be assured if people can hold their government to its promises, which would ultimately need to be backed by the threat of force in extreme circumstances.</p>

I think it even had something to do with his passing. He would go to pain doctor after pain doctor giving him oxycontins and oxycodone. Its an awful cycle, even my dad used them right at first but it caught him and my mom for a little while. Watching my dad break his ribs on purpose and calling the ambulance and telling them he fell was just heartbreaking. It turned him into a nother person. He didnt take them to get high, he actualy needed them at first ,He was burried in a ditch that collapesd in on him and ge was bed riddrn for a year. But it spiraled into something more.

This data was checked yesterday. I assume they&#39;re making sure their data is correct because of increased traffic to their website during this time.</p>

<p>Seriously, you guys need gun control. Why can you not accept this? This is completely mental to me. I live in Australia and my brother owns a shotgun and a few lower caliber rifles for pest control. All it took was time and patience to get these weapons, none of which you idiots seem to have. I&#39;ve also never bore witness to a shooting in public (or private), ever... How many Americans can claim the same? I&#39;d love to see those stats.</p>

<p>The UK, Australia have guns in the hands of the public, just less of them, because you need a reason to own a gun in these countries. Unlike in America, you can literally walk into a store and buy a gun, a lethal weapon, over the counter, no questions asked, no license required (driving a car, which is also a weapon, requires a license, why not a gun?). Guns in the hands of unstable people who might be angry at someone for petty reasons, or brainwashed with dangerous ideology (like the guy in this shooting).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think we have a few issues.  First, high homicide rates coincide almost perfectly with racial minority concentrations and very well with poverty.  As a start, most of those countries are almost entirely European.  Blacks make up 3.5% of the population in the UK, 1.6% in Australia, 1.42% in Ireland, 1% in Sweden and Finland, vs 13% in the US.  So considering the violence is centered around these groups, and most other countries don&#39;t have these groups, that explains enough of the violence to get the US on par or below the rest of the world. </p>

<p>Yeah, you&#39;ve got a violence/gun problem on top of a racism problem on top of the social problem - doesn&#39;t really change the fact that you&#39;ve got a gun problem. Because e.g. mass shootings ain&#39;t a racial minority problem and those also mostly happen in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lives being lost are damn few, and there are many solutions that are being ignored, because they don&#39;t meet the goal, which is restrictions on guns.  The conversation is never &quot;How can we improve this.&quot; its &quot;When will we be allowed to restrict guns.&quot;  I have a plan that I think would help, at the very least, make a difference.</p>

<p>End gun free zones.  All they do is disarm law abiding concealed carriers, who are statistically more law abiding than police, who are allowed to carry.  Force any school shooter to confront the idea that someone might very well shoot back. </p>

<p>Decriminalize drugs.  The war on drugs helps no one.  Addiction is a disease, not a crime.  Legalize marijuana and tax it, funnel the money into healthcare (of all kinds, not just mental health, people need help).  This will also hit gangs hard since drug sales are usually their main source of income.</p>

<p>Start outreach programs for students who are struggling.  They need to know someone is there to help, and that they aren&#39;t at it all alone. </p>

<p>Seal records of most felons.  When they get out of prison, they have served their time and repayed their debt to society.  As long as their crime was non-violent (and a few others), we gain nothing by making them report it when trying to get a job, and then they end up either right back in crime, or right back in jail. </p>

<p>Encourage media outlets to stop sensationalizing mass murder.  We know there are individuals out there with the necessary conditions to commit mass murder.  Research suggests the media reports (some of them like a damn scoreboard) inspire more shooters, as well as teach them how to carry our their shooting better. </p>

<p>All options that I would be good money would cost significantly less, wouldn&#39;t violate anyone&#39;s rights, and solve multiple problems at a time, instead of just making one of the tools harder to get. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with ending gun free zones and decriminalizing drugs, but for different reasons. Gun free zones are only ineffective because you can leave the area and just bring a gun back, they really are a complete waste of time. And a persons drug use won’t directly kill or harm other people around him, so I don’t see why that isn’t just a personal choice, albeit a harmful one. All we can do is offer help, and if they decide that they wanna kill themselves and keep using drugs, that’s their choice. </p>

<p>Outreach programs are a good idea, but they don’t necessarily work unless the student tells someone that they need help, or they ask for it themselves, and although I guess they might still be useful, they require the student of their parents to request the help first. </p>

<p>I also agree with the fact that the media should stop sensationalizing mass murder, but there isn’t really anything we can do to legally prevent that without infringing on the first amendment. </p>

<p>Sealing the records of felons is a very touchy thing, but assuming that the crime or situation which caused it (at the discretion of a court), was of good reason, I wouldn’t be against it. </p>

<p>The thing with all of these is, as smart and useful as they are, is that it’s still possible that one traumatized kid might get through all of these things, buy a gun, and kill someone. </p>

<p>Gun restrictions have been proven to work in almost every other first world country, and the only reason America can’t move forward with them, is the Second Amendment. People like to compare guns to cars and knives and other stuff, but the thing is that those things serve other important purposes. They weren’t intended for killing. A gun does one thing, and that is kill, so why people are so determined to defend their right to kill is beyond me. </p>

<p>For starters, there is scale.  It would require confiscation of 60-80 million guns here which would either cost a fortune we don&#39;t have, or require repealing 2 constitutional amendments.  They can&#39;t possibly get the votes, and the Supreme Court has several rulings stating the same laws would be unconstitutional here.  Not sure if you know how our laws work, but if the Supreme Court says they are not constitutional, they are null and void. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The government bought back some 600k firearms, and destroyed them all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They confiscated them.  I guarantee they didn&#39;t pay full value, and it wasn&#39;t optional.  That&#39;s not a buyback. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The accountability from any manufacturer is non existent. Now they&#39;re going after doctors who prescribe too much and patients who need their meds and the manufacturers get off scot free, if anything they&#39;ll be fined a couple of million dollars while raking in hundreds of billions per year. They win. Ethics clearly doesn&#39;t exist in the corporate world anymore. </p>

<p>I believe this is a bigger issue than guns. Walk around any metro area and tell me what you see more of? In Brooklyn it&#39;s flooded with drug addicts looking for a way to get their pills, most of them don&#39;t have guns, they would hock it immediately. </p>

<p>A few kids were killed yesterday, how many people died from an overdose or accidental overdose? The only reason everyone is up in arms about this shit is because it&#39;s muh children so they try to guilt you into feeling bad. Watch what is going to happen now.

    <div class="md"><p>Because opiate manufacturers aren’t producing illicit Fentanyl. In addition to the CDC double counting numbers (and coming clean which hasn’t been published mind you as commonly known) as a result contradicts lower script writing, and an overall decline in overdoses attributable to pharmaceutical narcotics since about 2009. Big Pharma knows this and is fighting tooth and nail because they actually tried to fix this problem after the Florida, Kentucky, and West Virginia Pill Mill issues came about. The charts show a completely different story when you compare real numbers vs propaganda to finance Medicaid paid rehab and drug court mandated programs of course created by big PHARMA with drugs like Vivitrol. Look no further than Indiana’s new law. The company actually drafted the laws for the state lol. It’s ridiculous. So now instead of making mills off pills, they’re making $1,000 per shot on the tax payers dime (Medicaid approved rehab drugs), vs what was happening on the insurer’s dime. </p>

<p>Of course deaths reported by medical examiners and labs during this period of time wasn’t specific in the type of narcotic most overdose from outside of a morphine equivalent. When samples have been retested and specific to the drug moving forward they’re finding the typical culprit as an illicit Fentanyl or a mix of alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other drugs where labels specifically say not to mix with the drugs. </p>

<p>At some point you have to blame the largest supplier of street narcotics, the drug cartels, CIA, and of course China - as well as human citizens of the USA, I mean our appetite for drugs is extreme. Meanwhile the DEA, CDC, and Federal Government are blaming the Pharma industry when analysts who study Afghanistan have proven our military involvement was like pouring fertilizer on the illicit Heroin trade, shaking up drug markets - if not the entire reason we where there to start with? </p>

<p>Islamic hardliners (now called ISIS) had actually banned the production of illicit poppy which showed a massive decline in street heroin (forcing a new more powerful drug to take its place) until we showed up relinquishing control back to the farmers actually allowing them to produce even more heroin. When the ideal solution would have been offering a white market for big Pharma, but that’s controlled through countries west of the Middle East - so the black market raged back, and then some, combining Fentanyl, thus a much higher number of overdoses. </p>

<p>Drug cartels realized early on when we fucked up the heroin market is was easier and much more profitable to just mix Fentanyl in with the slighter flow of heroin in turning a profit. Then, realized it was easier to just produce illicit Fentanyl inside the US after shipping from China, through Canada, and down into Chicago for distribution across the US vs the southern border - directly into their market the Midwest and East Coast. </p>

<p>Now they produce Fentanyl based - Xanax, Hydrocodone, Oxy, Roxy, whatevs you want in millions of pills daily right here in the US. About two years ago the DEA noticed an alarming trend. At the border less and less narcotics were coming through, replaced by pill presses and mixing/stepping chemicals to produce dark Pharma lookalikes. Most of the illegal pills going around now are simply Fentanyl look-a-likes as most of the Pharma loose control and slip through narcotics have dried up for the most part outside of Classic markets where it’s distributed via foreign markets and redistributed back to the US. </p>

<p>This is why.  </p>

Meanwhile, the propaganda machine keeps saying the problem is prescription opiates. The main problem in 2018 illicit heroin/fentanyl, NOT prescription opiates. </p>

<p>&quot;Between 2010-2015 opioid overdose deaths in the US increased by 65%, roughly 13,000. And even a cursory examination of Figure 2 shows that increase was entirely due to injectable drugs like heroin or fentanyl.&quot;</p>

<p>It was down voted to oblivion even with tons of research linked, quoted, and cited. One of the websites even sent me a DMCA notice of copy-write for quoting their statements and I did so within the bounds of the law at the time. </p>

<p>I got tons of hate mail in my inbox from families who’s children died from overdoses. And it was well written with zero accusations or mean spirited. It was just the truth, backed up with morgue and medical examiner statements and facts about what is tested and when they started actually deciphering drugs, but still to this day only about 1/3 of the largest cities do it, and zero rural communities. It costs too much is always the complaint, but that’s not always true. </p>

<p>My links were then redirected to an Amazon ad virus. </p>

<p>And lastly the sub deleted my post. </p>

<p>Pharmaceutical companies SHOULD be culpable.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get your framing at all, and your misuse of the numbers (narrowed down to school shootings alone) is bizarre.</p>

<p>Secondly, gun manufacturers shouldn’t be held responsible, the person who shot should. All we need to do is create stricter gun laws and regulation.

This was for children. The president of the company &quot;we did nothing ethically wrong&quot; not a single person went to jail. And, most likely, you never heard about this.  Untouchable</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well one has to overdose to die so...I reckon if the overdose happened.. via another person.. forcing the pills down the persons mouth. Might have some ground to stand on and it would be different. I would blame the doctors more than the drug company. These &quot;doctors&quot; are the real drug dealers. They stuff kill way more than illegal drug dealers...other than it being illegal.. Any weak ass punk can pull a trigger. One bullet can hit two targets..  pretty sure there aren&#39;t any pills that will kill a fool with one pill.... as far as I&#39;m concerned these people lettin the Internet raise they kids. Are major part of the problem. All these little assholes running around...are not getting an upbringing.</p>

<p>Take a karate class or stand up for your fellow classmates. When they getting picked on. Sure my 8 and 12 year old been pcmasterrace since they could use a mouse and keyboard. And would rather play pc games... but they gonna learn how to treat other humans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain exactly how gun manufacturers are being held responsible for the actions of their &#39;products&#39;? Keeping in mind that these products aren&#39;t designed for a certain purpose and then being misused, they are designed specifically with no other purpose than to kill and destroy at the highest rate possible. Opiates are actually still to this day the most effective relief for acute pain, the problem isn&#39;t with the product, it is with the distribution and lack of regulations in place to provide the drugs to those who truely need it. This is the paradoxical nature of the first amendment right in full view, in that its fine to want access to military grade weapons and hospital grade narcotics but without regulatory bodies in place to limit the access to these things, they are always going be exploited and misused by certain elements of the popultion. Im neither American nor religious, but divine intervention is possibly the only thing that can save the U.S from itself currently...</p>

It&#39;s not cool to portray the data to take the heat off guns.
But you are right, the pharma companies also have lots of explaining to do about overdosing, but that doesn&#39;t mean we neglect gun usage</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you seen to not have experience with opioids (bless you), addiction is extremely, extremely quick. Which is a huge part of the problem. I had an massive arm injury mountain biking and was prescribed heavy pain killers post surgery/reconstruction. My wife, knowing the dangers only let me take them for about a week. Coming off the drugs was worse than the pain, crazy mood swings, depression, and irritability borderline rage(I&#39;m a super chill guy). That shit is scary. I cant imagine what it would have been like had I taken the 3 weeks worth and then had to come off cold turkey. </p>

<p>Granted I&#39;d rather do that than be shot in the face, but too many people blow off just how fucking scary addiction can be and how hard and fast it can hit you with these strong prescriptions even when not abused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my point though. I wasn&#39;t abusing it. I was actively wary of it and it still fucked me up. I was chemically addicted at 3 days of appropriate use, and my prescription called for 3 weeks and I could have gotten refills no sweat. I WANTED more of it but I had a strong support system who kept me in check. My point being, when it comes to these heavy pain killers, people need to be more aware. Most opioid abusers do so, or at least started, on a legit prescription.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just my point of view but I feel as though this comparison is completely irrelevant? 
Yes pharmaceutical manufacturers need to be dealt with but I am certain that all these drug overdoses are not from junkies running around stabbing people with drugs. The difference is people who die from drugs are the ones who of drugs. Random people don’t just get a prescription and overdose (not majority of the time at least). The difference is that innocent children going to school getting an education and psychopaths and people with other mental illnesses have access to weapons they shouldn’t. How can you compare drug addicts to innocent kids getting shot for no reason?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While these are all great arguments might I add one that is oh so true yet so ugly and without solution that is a real threat to all humanity? That fact that there are people who along with their partners married or not should by the very maligned genes that make up their existence have no business whatsoever creating children. Children who grow as copies of both bad genes, who in turn continue the genetic line only worse through no fault of their own. We all no people like this, we see them and say, please for the sake of our humanity do not have any more!</p>

<p>This is extreme and vile and of course impossible to imagine in any way correcting right. My God it brings up visions of the worst memories of history.</p>

<p>And yet when you step back and se it objectively, it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true at its most palatable form as mental illness or in another form as racial hatred, depression, sociopathic behavior, or even straight stupidity. </p>

<p>What is the answer to this since it is inevitably  apart of the equation to all arguments here. And no, kindness or putting the children into a good home never changes the genes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there will be a viscous hatred toward me for even mentioning it, but nonetheless this truth is part of all the evolutionary perils we face.</p>

<p>Any takers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a paid commenter, just a sensible gun owner that believe in sensible gun regulations, universal background checks, closing the gun show loop hole and outlawing bump stocks.  If you love the second amendment and your guns, you would be wise to get on board with moderate gun reform because the alternative is that the millennial generation that is growing up terrified of being murdered in school will eventually repeal the 2nd amendment and take your guns.  The public outcry is growing and while it won&#39;t happen tomorrow it will eventually happen if something isn&#39;t done to stop these mass shootings.  </p>

<p>Also, school shootings are absolutely real there are hundreds of victims and thousands of witnesses.  Furthermore, if you are honest with yourselves you know that owning an a couple of ARs and 10,000 rounds of ammo is no deterrent to the Federal Government.  Gun owners like to act like they are the final check and balance for a corrupt government.  A few thousand nut jobs with MOAN ABE tattoos who can&#39;t agree if 9/11 was perpetrated by the government, the Illuminati, or international Jewish conspiracy aren&#39;t capable of uniting to become any kind of armed fighting force.  Gun owners are fed NRA propaganda until it runs down their leg and you guys regurgitate it on these forums right on cue.  Our government is so incredibly incompetent and inefficient that they can&#39;t even keep the Federal Government funded.  You guys like to get on these forums and talk big about how you are the only ones who see the danger and the government is trying pacify and disarm you so that they can take advantage of the people.  They don&#39;t need guns to do that, they are already doing that by funnelling your tax dollars to their rich friends and engaging in dirty business practices and deregulating big banks.  The gap between the richest and poorest is wider than ever and everyone still has their guns.   They keep you distracted by telling you that libtards are coming for your Bibles and guns while they are cashing out.  Your votes are more powerful than your guns, but first you have to realize you been had.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There seems to be a lot of misinformation here, and unfortunately the title just adds to it. </p>

<p>Opiate manufactures have faced more legal accountability than gun manufacturers. Multiple major cities (most recent is NYC) have sued Purdue for damages and misleading advertising about their dangerous product related to the opioid epidemic. Chicago won their lawsuit. More could be done to help the opioid epidemic, but it should be noted that gun companies have not yet faced this same level of legal accountability. As of this week Purdue declared they no longer will advertise directly to doctors. Currently gun manufactures give millions of dollars to the NRA for advertising and lobbying. Stopping this and holding them legally accountable for the damages they&#39;ve caused with the mass shooting epidemic is absolutely a good start to making change. It&#39;s better than doing nothing, which has been the current solution.</p>

We can assume that those numbers are higher today.  Out of all these millions of people only a handful have committed these terrible crimes by bringing weapons to school and shooting other students.  Although these are very tragic events, the odds of having more of these type of crimes committed as per the population that attends school show that we can not blame video games, guns, nor administration as the cause.  We have to understand that our schools are safer than we believe and publicizing these tragic events so strongly and then using them as examples to push gun control is irresponsible.  We are very lucky there hasn&#39;t been a whole lot more of these incidences in comparison to the school population in our nation.  If we keep putting out into the public domain all this shock and awe we are encouraging another broken person to commit the same monstrosity.  </p>

Pot is a great example of this, once big pharmaceutical companies figure out a way to profit off pot whether it be via patents for certain genetics (like Monsanto did with soy), cutting out the little guys buy basically “lobbying” for new laws/regulations, or artificially increase land prices to push out anyone smaller and eliminate competition, then I promise pot would be legal nation wide in no time. 
Same thing with these politicians speaking in favor of an oil company that has in some form or another, given them something of monetary value.  Probably a good time to clean house and start fresh..</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re right that in some places gun rights are unjustly restricted as a result of politicians taking the easy route of throwing out some &quot;feel good&quot; ineffective and inconvenience.</p>

<p>But the fact that tackling the mental health aspect is ignored doesn&#39;t logically imply that more restrictive gun laws will reduce avoidable gun deaths.</p>

<p>And you don&#39;t get to say what the effect of a law will be. You don&#39;t know because no one does. We can only make reasonable changes and see what happens. It&#39;s way too complex of a system to talk about how you are.</p>

<p>&quot;But they&#39;ll still get what they want&quot;
Yeah, alright. How is that going to work? Imagine an insane person.</p>

<p>They can either get the gun legally and easily for a fair cost or have to find a criminal contact who would sell them a gun for a big price increase.</p>

<p>Guns are not drugs. There is not nearly enough willing illegal gun users to support this idea that some random crazy guy could buy a gun as easily as some weed.</p>
