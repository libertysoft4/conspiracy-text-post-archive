    <div class="md"><p>When you realize that guns are not the problem, I think you might change this sentiment.  Define crazy. Legally crazy. If crazy people use cars to mow down people on a sidewalk, do we attack cars?  If they use fertilizer to blow up federal buildings, do attack Scott’s Turfbuilder?  Guns are not the problem. Crazy people are the problem. Whether they kill with guns, cars, or fertilizer doesn’t change the fact that they are crazy and will use whatever method they deem most useful to accomplish their task. Hard to solve this problem of the focus is the weapon of choice rather than the motive or the actor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or here&#39;s a thought.  Perhaps as a society we stop encouraging &quot;crazy&quot;?
90 % of school shootings involved a shooter with a history of phsych med use.  Instead of tossing pills down kids throats for not &quot;conforming&quot; to a ridiculous adult standard of behavior every time.  </p>

<p>Or maybe we stop telling kids that its NORMAL to be confused about what gender they are because they caught Johnny playing with dolls one day.  So to be the &quot;progressive parent&quot; they rush them into hormone therapy.</p>

<p>Guns and the 2nd amendment have existed for years.  When I was in high school it was not uncommon for several trucks to have guns in the back window.  Kids fought with their fists and never thought once about grabbing their rifle.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That flies in the face of the point of the bill of rights. They are absolutes, they are the most basic and important of our country. It&#39;s easy to say free speech isn&#39;t absolute, but that is a completely different thing than gun control.</p>

<p>People censure others speech. But the government is not allowed to. People are not allowed to reduce your right to bare arms. And the government was never supposed to do that. </p>

<p>You say it&#39;s about nuance. But the nuance behind gun rights was exactly the situation we are in now where the common people stand no chance if they have to rise up and overthrow their government. This was the entire point of the right to bare arms. </p>

<p>By limiting that in any way you violate the purpose of the law. This isn&#39;t like letting people create a digital safe space. It is about ensuring that the people have the ability to overthrow an oppressive government. Which can&#39;t be done when they drop bombs from drones but won&#39;t let you have a fully auto AR. </p>

<p>The bill of rights was not meant to be nuanced it was meant, like our constitution, to be a plane direct statement of law. We have made it nuanced because neither is very well written for the modern age. </p>

<p>Your right to bare arms is never supposed to be touched and all changes to that are unconstitutional. There is nothing in our constitution that removes those rights from felons, or mentally unhealthy people. That is all bull shit added later. It was meant to be an absolute. Because otherwise when we got where we are now we have no chance of restoring our freedom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Cool, don&#39;t live in America. Because what we see as Rights, are the foundation of this nation.&quot; was the comment i originally replied to. This discussion veered off some since then. My point is that the right of unrestricted access to firearms has a cost, and that cost is mass shootings and a higher gun violence rate. My point is also that while people fake being shocked, they are well aware of this trade off, and think it&#39;s a good deal. Im not advocating gun control. Spin this question however you want, there is a real cost to this right. You want to push some kind of moses tablet version of the second amendment, im fine with that. But im not fine with everybody acting shocked and surprised when this happens over and over again. Its dishonest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Law of freedom:
Freedom and morality are directly proportional.
As morality increases, Freedom increases. As morality declines, freedom declines.
True freedom CAN NEVER exist in a society that embraces moral relativism (the idea that there is no inherent and objective difference between right and wrong, so humanity may arbitrarily &#39;create&#39; or &#39;decide&#39; right and wrong for themselves).
Morality:
It&#39;s not right versus left. It&#39;s right versus wrong
A deep understanding of morality, principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong behavior, lies at the very heart of natural law.
RIGHT VS WRONG:
Correct Based on Truth
Moral Based in Natural Law
Actions based in it do not result in harm to sovereign beings.
VS
Incorrect Not based in Truth
Immoral Not based in Natural Law
Actions based in it result in harm to other Sovereign beings.</p>

You have a natural right to try to do anything at all, including harming or enslaving other people. Of course, other people carry that same natural right against you. Everyone also has the natural right to try to stop others from harming or enslaving them. But nobody has the natural right to succeed at any of these activities. Your natural rights end when somebody else successfully takes them from you. The social structures of government may either protect these natural rights or destroy them through physical force. </p>

Try to attack a monkey or take away it&#39;s young. You will be attacked and it is justified in doing so. </p>

<p>So then you don&#39;t believe you are born free? Or have a right to owning yourself? You don&#39;t believe killing another without it being justified is a wrong action that results in harm to another?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s universally understood by most of the world already that it&#39;s a wrong action. We&#39;ll never be free or grow as a collective when we view the world through the lens of &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Than you don&#39;t belong in this discussion. If you as rent even aware of why you have the right to bare arms you have no right to argue either way.</p>

<p>The right to bare arms did not have a damn thing to do with protecting yourself from your neighbor. It is about protecting your freedom from your government. </p>

<p>The entire point of the right to bare arms is so we can overthrow an oppressive government. It has nothing to do with you feeling unsafe because some redneck has a stock pile of arms.  That feeling is not relevant. His right to those guns is. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t fight off a government using drone warfare with semi auto pistols or rifles. With half the mag capacity, no body armor, no grenades. No anti air weaponry. </p>

<p>None of that is supposed to be limited because of why we have the right to bare arms. Which is to fight back against an oppressive government. </p>

<p>Guns can cause considerable collateral damage, especially when proper safety measures aren&#39;t taken.  For example I leave a loaded gun beside my bed in case of a home intruder.  One day when I&#39;m not home somebody breaks in and steals my gun.  They use that gun to murder somebody else and boom that&#39;s collateral damage.</p>

<p>So how much collateral damage is enough to warrant banning a particular form of self-defense/self-preservation?</p>

<p>I never said the person who had their gun stolen was guilty of murder (we can both agree they were probably guilty of negligence though).</p>

<p>Your argument was that I can&#39;t have a nuke because of collateral damage.  My point was that letting guns be so easily accessible causes collateral damage as well?

<p>Guns are easily obtained where I live.  And (surprise) we have very little gun violence.  In fact nobody I know owns a gun, I&#39;ve never talked to someone who said they owned a gun, I&#39;ve probably never even seen a gun (I know cops have them but still never seen one).</p>

<p>Except for when I visit the States of course where I see guns everywhere.</p>

<p>Also 3D printed guns are hardly a threat.  Have you every used a 3D printer?</p>

<p>Except that 99.9999% of cars never end up being used in an attack.  They also have a completely legitimate use aside from being used in terrorist attacks.</p>

<p>Guns have a single use: shooting bullets at a target to seriously injure or kill them.</p>

<p>Mexico still has less gun related deaths per 100,00 inhabitants than the US does.</p>

<p>I have two dogs so and live beside a police station so not too worried about my house being invaded.  Also home invasions with guns are way less common here than in the US.  I&#39;ve never actually heard of one happening, I&#39;m sure it does, but it&#39;s not very common.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about the times guns have saved people? There are lots of stories of people saving others because they happened to be carrying a gun.</p>

<p>If guns were an effective safety measure the US wouldn&#39;t lead the world in mass shootings and the developed world in gun deaths per capita.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess you ultimately believe guns should only be at the hands of police/military and not the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, if somebody really wants a gun then let them have it.  But they should have a required safety course, minimum waiting period, background check and an in person interview.  Where I live these are all requirements to get a gun.  This is a fair balance between the people who want guns and the people who don&#39;t want guns flooding the streets like in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That worked out well in the past for tyrants like Mao, Hitler, Pao and Stallin.</p>

<p>What about all the other countries that have strict gun control laws and (surprise) much lower rates of gun violence than the US?</p>

<p>Yes, I can be viewed as an anarchist. If you go by it&#39;s proper definition.
Anarchy from the Greek Prefix:
An- : Without; the absence of
&amp; the Greek noun:
Archon: Master;ruler</p>

<p>Anarchy does not mean &quot;without rules&quot; it literally means &quot;without rulers&quot;</p>

<p>No rulers and no masters. I like to call myself a &#39;voluntarist&#39; since anarchy nowadays has been conditioned to people to mean destruction or chaos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a classic philosophical question:</p>

<p>You&#39;re standing on a bridge with a very fat man.  Below the bridge a car wreck has trapped two families on the train tracks, in the path of an oncoming train.</p>

<p>Assuming this guy is really fat (ya, it&#39;s only hypothetical) and we&#39;re 100% sure that we could push him into the path of the train, slowing it down enough to save the two families, is it wrong to push him?</p>

<p>Some people might say we are obligated to push him in order to save the lives of the two innocent families below.  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.</p>

<p>Some people say the fat man has an unalienable right to not be pushed off the bridge.  It would be wrong to push him off even if it would save the lives of the families below.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>But if it was me and my family in the car I would desperately hope the person pushed the fat guy off.</p>

<p>What if instead of a fat guy it’s an old man?  He’s 100 years old, he can’t have more than a few years left.  Wouldn’t you want to him to get pushed off the bridge if it was you and your family in the car?</p>

<p>Everybody has the right to form their own opinions on questions like this.  There are many valid answers and we can’t say which one is absolutely correct.</p>

<p>It depends on our definition of what is “morally wrong” or “morally right”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok how about this situation.</p>

<p>You&#39;re standing at a junction for some train tracks.  Beside you is a lever, if you pull the lever the train goes left.  If you don&#39;t touch the lever the train goes right.</p>

<p>On the right said of the tracks a villain has tied up an entire family and left them in the path of the train.</p>

<p>On the left side of the tracks the villain has tied up an old man and left him in the path of the train.</p>

<p>Morally speaking, not touching the lever is the moral option. You don&#39;t stain your hands in blood by not getting involved.</p>

<p>I can understand why this would be viewed negatively considering one side is guaranteed to die. But saving one side you kill another. Maybe some would choose an immoral action to save more lives. Very interesting to think about.</p>

<p>Doing an immoral action or an action that causes harm to another will almost always result in a negative outcome for you.

    <div class="md"><p>Again - moral is still subjective - a convergence of collective norms.</p>

<p>Cultures all across the planet have sacrificed families for what they believed to be true, for a greater good - and they didn&#39;t deem it immoral because they were doing it for whatever deity they believed in. Believing it to be true that he/she wanted that sacrifice. So to them, killing and harming another was not immoral - quite the contrary.</p>

<p>Harming others has been done to ensure safety of others, through torture, imprisonment, psychiatric treatments etc. - and they weren&#39;t deemed immoral - until fairly recently.</p>

<p>Morality and perceived truth are not static. They change - and are extremely subjective, within the collective. So yes - they are indeed up for interpretation.</p>

<p>Of course those who&#39;re the victim of either might not feel it to be moral or true - but in the greater scope of things, it appears so to the rest.</p>

<p>Karma is an idea - a very nice one at that. But if the only thing keeping people from harming others, is the odds that it will hurt themselves, you&#39;re dealing with a scary bunch of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok so again two completely different things. You only have the &quot;right&quot; to earn what you make from your job because of this system that we as humans have set up. Do women have the &quot;right&quot; to make less then men? This is a system that has been set up for us. Call it rights, call it whatever you want but it was created by man and has been dictated to you, not inherently part of us. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;owning my own body&quot;. </p>

<p>If we were living alongside the dinosaurs right now, and one came by, scooped me up in its mouth and swallowed me. Would that mean my rights were violated? Or that a common scene in nature played out? we really only define these rights as how we interact with each other, man to man, human to human. </p>

<p>what if you think it is your right that you are free. But someone else, a king, a ruler, something like that, thinks that it is his right to enslave you for the greater good?</p>

<p>You are two humans with different beliefs. We agree that it would be immoral for the latter to happen, but that is just our beliefs. </p>

<p>Where do these rights come from, if not dictated by religion or law? The universe applies these rights living things? Have they always been the same rights? </p>

<p>I believe that living things are programmed to survive and reproduce. Not because it is defined that it is their right to do so, but because their DNA has been programmed to do this. Did the single cell organisms that we all evolved from, have rights?</p>

<p>Personally, I feel that the &quot;rights&quot; that are applied to us are important and should be maintained, but I don&#39;t believe that these &quot;rights&quot; are a natural component of the universe. I believe that they were born out of compassion that some humans had towards other humans. I believe this is very important, but still created by man. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll get back to the rest of what you said, I simply have to go for a bit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;owning my own body&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I allowed to tell you what you can do with your body? Can I sell your body parts to others? Owning yourself means that only you can decide what happens with your body; since no one owns it except you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what if you think it is your right that you are free. But someone else, a king, a ruler, something like that, thinks that it is his right to enslave you for the greater good?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They would be wrong and immoral. Just because someone in a position of authority thinks it&#39;s the right thing, doesn&#39;t make it so. It&#39;s not about what you think is right, but what actually IS based on TRUTH. 
If you don&#39;t believe in gravity, you can jump off a building and find out that it&#39;s real. If you don&#39;t believe the sun is hot, you would still be wrong. We find the truth and discover it and try our best to align ourselves with it as close as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that living things are programmed to survive and reproduce. Not because it is defined that it is their right to do so, but because their DNA has been programmed to do this. Did the single cell organisms that we all evolved from, have rights?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure exactly what you mean, everything has a right to survival. It&#39;s what I mean with universal Laws that exist already through nature and the universe. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I feel that the &quot;rights&quot; that are applied to us are important and should be maintained, but I don&#39;t believe that these &quot;rights&quot; are a natural component of the universe. I believe that they were born out of compassion that some humans had towards other humans. I believe this is very important, but still created by man. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are entitled to your opinion and maybe you are right, who knows; but I do know that actions that cause harm to others are wrong; and if an action doesn&#39;t hurt anyone then you should be allowed to do it. Regardless of what someone tells you like a king, president, group of people ect.</p>

<p>It was February of last year. Wasn’t a fan of it then, either. I’m of the small, mostly silent, group of people that thinks folks should be able to own whatever kind of gun (not getting into stupid arguments with trolls asking if I think an individual should own a nuke - the answer is no) but that the vetting process should be MUCH, MUCH more thorough. Fruitcakes and people with a criminal history of VIOLENCE don’t need ‘em.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fucking hate tRump but the last I remember was the republican controlled gov. blocked (before he became president) a requirement that doctors who thought a patient was too mentally unstable own a gun (mostly via ss disability) were not allowed to weigh in on this. as in those records not be allowed to be part of the normal background check during the purchasing of a gun. I haven&#39;t attempted to look this up for times and details, but i do remember the NRA ads about how the dems were trying to stop hundreds of thousands  of (US CITIZENS) on SS from being allowed to own a gun that got a lot of attention. The problem of course was nobody corrected the left out fact that those were only mentally unstable recipients that doctors felt very strongly should not be allowed to have access to a firearm.</p>
