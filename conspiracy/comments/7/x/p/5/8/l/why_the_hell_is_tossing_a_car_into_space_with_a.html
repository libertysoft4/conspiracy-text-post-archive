    <div class="md"><p>Look up the theory about Stanley Kubrick filming the &#39;moon landing&#39;. &quot;Space may be the final frontier but it&#39;s made in a Hollywood basement&quot; is a lyric I like to refer to often. After all, a picture was taken of Kubrick walking in a Hollywood back alley with several head NASA employees and an astroNOT. The US gov&#39;t paid for a majority of the Kubrick film <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, several gov&#39;t agencies were listed in the credits. A year later we &quot;landed on the moon&quot;. Speaking of Hollywood, did you know the wood of the Holly tree was the pagan wood of choice for magic wands, dating back to the Nordic era? It was sacred to them because it symbolized Holle or Hel, the Norse goddess of the underworld. Hollywood is the propaganda machine of Operation Mockingbird, the program to brainwash and indoctrinate the American public. Here&#39;s an interesting quote for the masses: &quot;we&#39;ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false&quot; - CIA Director William Casey, 1981. Barbara Honegger is the source of the quote, but feel free to research it if you still think &#39;Murica is the greatest country of all time and would <em>never</em> lie to Americans. Speaking of Americans, we are not citizens because the US is not a country. We are debt collateral because the US is a Federal Corporation and the proof is right in front of your eyes. 28 US Code 3002, (15) &quot;United States&quot; means - (A) a Federal Corporation. We are collateral, not citizens.</p>

<p>this is just ONE alternative example. how far do you suppose that disk was launched? 40ft? 50ft? it definitely cleared the tree tops. thats just with rando bob whatshisballs 8 capacitors 11 years ago. i imagine today in 2018 with the wealth and technology available to elon musk he must be able to construct a capacitor bank capable of launching objects into orbit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with this is  that it&#39;s just one initial pulse vs a rocket which has continuous thrust.  Basically that first pulse would have to launch the rocket and get it to escape velocity (over 40 000 km/sec) in a very small amount of time, which would put insane amounts of stress on the structure.</p>

<p>Maybe there are better ways (space elevator?), but this doesn&#39;t really seem to be one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>as i said this is just one example. if you build such a device into the structure youre launching you could theoretically have a continuous controllable steady d.c pulse that would propel your craft until your power runs out. slap a turbine on that fucker and you could run it indefinitely by compressed air or even a fucking series of hand cranks. worst comes to worse its one ground based pulse that launches your object to escape velocity and THEN conventional thrusters can take over. that would STILL be more efficient than these archaic oversized fireworks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also you are 100% sure that your opinion is correct, which you probably got from some shady youtube video on a channel where they propagate the flat earth and tell you the apocalypse is comming, so that they can sell their survival kits and anti-mind-control helmets, to dumb fools who will believe their shit?</p>

<p>So we have statement against statement. No one of us believes the other. So since it&#39;s you, that is making this huge claims, why don&#39;t you try to convince me of your delusion?</p>

<p>cheering fan boys and edited SpaceX live videos don&#39;t take away the pure fictious effort of &quot;space&quot; of Elon Musk and NASA, ESA, and Russia.</p>
