<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7jniyIWPc0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7jniyIWPc0</a></p>

<p>To give context, here&#39;s witness testimony from journalist Chris Hedges on fatal shootings of Palestinian children by &quot;the most moral army in the world&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Yesterday at this spot the Israelis shot eight young men, six of whom were under the age of eighteen. One was twelve. This afternoon they kill an eleven-year-old boy, Ali Murad, and seriously wound four more, three of whom are under eighteen. Children have been shot in other conflicts I have covered—death squads gunned them down in El Salvador and Guatemala, mothers with infants were lined up and massacred in Algeria, and Serb snipers put children in their sights and watched them crumple onto the pavement in Sarajevo—but I have never before watched soldiers entice children like mice into a trap and murder them for sport.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>General acceptance of killing Palestinian children pervades Israeli politics:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Israelis proudly tweet their desire to murder children: “Kill Arab children so there won’t be a next generation,” “Stinking Arabs may you die, amen,” and “Arabs may you be paralyzed and die with great suffering” are some representative tweets exposed by Israeli journalist David Sheen.</p>

<p>Israeli parliamentarian Ayelet Shaked has announced that she wants to kill not only Palestinian children, whom she calls “little snakes,” but also the Palestinian mothers who raise them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>One soldier bragged of killing 13 children. Was it a bluff?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A T-shirt popular in the Israeli army shows a pregnant woman with a target on her belly. The legend reads: “One shot two kills.”</p>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An October 2004 study by British Medical Journal confirmed that this is a common practice, and never punished: “Two thirds of the 621 children (two thirds under 15 years) killed at checkpoints, in the street, on the way to school, in their homes, died from small arms fire, directed in over half of cases to the head, neck and chest – the sniper’s wound…Clearly, soldiers are routinely authorised to shoot to kill children in situations of minimal or no threat.”</p>

<p>Probably because the (((media))) will delete it from all other platforms?</p>

<p>Seriously CNN filmed a soldier shooting a Palestinian child (Israel claims he was a medic or something who didn&#39;t know the bullets were lethal and not rubber coated). Did CNN keep the footage on it&#39;s webpage?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably the most left-wing person I know is Jewish, and all you have to do is bring up Israel and see all of her ideals instantly flip to the right.  </p>

<p>When I mention the hypocrisy she gets really flustered and always starts making arguments (just talking points really) about how it’s different because they’re Jewish, and that Jews need a country of their own because they’re so persecuted everywhere else.  This person is a medical doctor and is usually quite intelligent.  </p>

<p>I think she realizes how hypocritical she is being, but doesn’t care, because Jews (I have several Jewish friends) really do believe that they are “extra special” people, and are entitled to things that regular people aren’t.  </p>

<p>You all remember the Newspeak Dictionary; the one designed from the beginning to <em>limit the vocabulary</em>? Well, it&#39;s jumped from the pages of fiction to what passes for reality lately.</p>

<p>&quot;Rubber bullets, that&#39;s like Nerf Toys, right?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Settlers; aren&#39;t those like &#39;Little House on the Prairie&#39;?&quot;<br/>
