 says she saw 2 shooters run by (at 4 minutes 30 seconds)? Also she says the school had been doing school shooter drills recently (at 4 minutes 10 seconds), is this common nowadays (nvm, apparently it&#39;s common)?</p>

<p>edit: <a href="https://twitter.com/KHOUSportsMatt/status/963972590258806785?">here&#39;s</a> another interview of a student claiming she was with Cruz while another shooter was on the other side of the building.</p>

<p>Also check out the <em>disturbing</em> video <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/963883348035817473">here</a> that sounds like the shots are coming from 2 different places.</p>

<p>edit:  I&#39;m not saying the government sent fbi agents in to shoot all these kids, but maybe they manipulated some already unstable people for their own purposes, or they have an agenda they&#39;re trying to push in the media by changing the story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More likely that the AR-15 is the most commonly purchased semi-auto rifle in the US so a ton of people have them. You don’t see a lot of crimes committed with Sig-552s or Remington 700s because they’re generally more expensive and more rare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is also true.  But if someone <em>did</em> use a Sig, do you think any witnesses would correctly identify it?  Or would they just say it was an AR?  Also meaning that you can pretty easily tell by sound and speed of shots that someone is shooting a semi-auto .223, and again, that would be labeled “AR”.</p>

<p>“Although the state’s murder total was 146 that year, only 110 of those deaths were assigned to specific local jurisdictions in the FBI report. The statewide tally of 146 includes the 27 victims of the Sandy Hook massacre.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but the interview of the girl in this video said nothing about how she saw two shooters and that they practiced mock shooting drills. She heard 5-6 shots and that it was a weird time to do fake FIRE DRILLS, there was no mention of a second shooter in this interview. I’m not sayin that it’s not possible, it very much could be, but this video neither proves nor disproves that fact. So idk where you guys heard about this in the context of this interview.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my experience:</p>

<p>high school in NYC 1993-1997 no drills</p>

<p>Boston University 1997-2001 no drills </p>

<p>MIT 2002-2004 (I worked there), no drills and no training, which I thought was very strange, since this was well past Columbine and several MIT students would commit suicide every year due to the pressure. My boss mentioned that she thought about what to do if there was a shooter, but there was no plan in place. There was a &quot;hazardous materials&quot; drill one year, which MIT spent a ridiculous amount of money on. </p>

<p>University of Chicago 2012-2017 (I worked there), no drills. &quot;Active shooters&quot; are mentioned on the last day of HR new employee training, but there are absolutely no drills. Post VTech shooting, this seems very odd. There are also a number of shootings on and around campus every year (just local crime) and still no drills. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Like I said, there was no talk of school shootings where I went to school in upstate NY (just before the Columbine shooting happened in 1999). I didn&#39;t expect there would have been much talk about it anywhere in the US before 1999.</p>

<p>Any training you would get now seems to be very basic. I think it&#39;s still the &quot;Run, Hide, Fight&quot; strategy like this from DHS: <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/options-consideration-active-shooter-preparedness-video">https://www.dhs.gov/options-consideration-active-shooter-preparedness-video</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think the Sandy Hook conspiracy is one of the stupidest ones, so no, it doesn&#39;t bother me in the slightest if people think it was a hoax, because I don&#39;t think very highly of people who fell for that lie (it happened, the hoax is the lie).</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t live in the US so your gun laws don&#39;t concern me, personally. It would be nice if Americans stopped shooting each other, just on a human level, but I&#39;m certainly not mad because I don&#39;t have a dog in this fight.</p>

<p>You said something that I disagree with; it isn&#39;t personal, I just don&#39;t think you&#39;re correct.</p>

<p>In terms of why you don&#39;t understand, it&#39;s because you&#39;re moving the goal posts. You said mass shooting were relatively new, and when I show you some data you say &quot;I was meaning in terms of school shootings etc not gang shootings&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No goal posts are being moved. Regardless of whether I meant gang shootings or not you can see the graph shooting up to unprecedented levels and I did say relatively all along. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-shooting-university-of-texas-tower">&quot;According to one recent history of mass murder in the United States, there had been just 25 mass shootings in the previous 50 years. In the half-century since, there have been more than 150.&quot;</a></p>

<p>My point is the guns have always been available and gun laws even more lax in the past, yet the mass shootings are rising in number. Is that not telling, that perhaps guns are not the issue but something else... agendas perhaps, not to mention media influence and mental health. Every criminal seems to become a celebrity of sorts in the media.</p>
