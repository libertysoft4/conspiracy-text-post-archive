        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am sick to death of having to re explain the whole thinking of whether or not Monsanto is &quot;extremely litigious&quot;</p>

<p>A commonly held belief here on reddit, primarily thanks to the Monsanto Mafia that we have among us is that &quot;no farmer has ever been sued for cross contamination&quot; There are very slight variations to this statement, such as add the word &quot;accidental&quot; or &quot;drifting seeds&quot; or a whole lot of other spins on the same idea. That is simply wrong. While they are right when they say that no farmer has ever been sued for drifting seeds or anything else like that, I am absolutely positive that any farmer/lawyer/judge/sane person in the world will tell you that that is a really horrible premise to hang a lawsuit on. Which is exactly why it has never happened. Monsanto has and continues to sue the hell out of farmers for acknowledging that simple fact and going after patent infringement. The fact that they and their friends continue to try to change the narrative of this is the most disgusting thing ever. It is kind of like how the jews never mention the other 5-7 million people that were killed during the holocaust. That is some unnerving crap.</p>

<p>During the argument with the Circuit Court, Judge Kimberly A. Moore calls them out for being and I quote here &quot;extremely litigious&quot;. The following link contains the audio recordings of the arguments.</p>

<p>Monsanto has sued a lot of farmers for patent infringing on their seeds.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most important set of links in this entry. The Center for Food Safety has done (and continues to do) a lot of work on this specific issue.</p>

<p>This entry explains why, and how much Monsanto stood to make. They even lifted pages from Monsanto&#39;s own website showing them displaying their efforts to other investors, including facts and figures on how much they could expect to get from various states farmers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I really do like the jewish people. Quite a lot in fact. However they do eem to have more than a few foibles. They have a very heavy presence in ALL of American media, and they have all spouted on and on and on about the 6 million jews that were killed during the holocaust. Never once have they mentioned the other people that were killed there. I personally have taken affront to that.</p>

<p>Nice pro-monsanto instant-discrediting shill. Toss in some super dumb shit right before your actual argument so normies immediately fuck off and associate anti-monsanto with holocaust denial.</p>
