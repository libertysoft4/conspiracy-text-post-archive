    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the way it works, buddy. When an extraordinary claim is made (deadliest mass shooting in US history), extraordinary evidence is then required of that party, the one making said claim.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already asked for visual proof of shots being fired and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7jbmcn/complete_this_sentence_or_meet_your_doom_the/">no one could even do that</a>.</p>

<p>If no extraordinary evidence accompanies the extraordinary claims, the rest of us are free to think the claims are bullshit.</p>

<p>Not to mention, there is certainly evidence that the event was faked. I just have no obligation to present it (even though I already have, in my post history) until there&#39;s at least proof that shots were really fired, which there is not.</p>

<p>Is this a joke?</p>

<p>Holy fuck dude. That&#39;s some of the dumbest shit I&#39;ve ever read.</p>

<p>Answer me this... Has the US government ever lied to the American people about a false flag attack?</p>

<p>You and I both know the answer.</p>

<p>Second question... if they have... why do you think they would never do it again.</p>

<p>Are you aware that the US gov repealed the law preventing them from weaponizing propaganda against its own citizens in 2013?</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t aware - now you are.</p>

<p>If they&#39;ve gone to the trouble of making it legal - why do you think they wouldn&#39;t use their new available provisions?</p>

<p>Your argument has as much depth as a car park puddle.</p>

<p>If you have hard evidence, you should be able to post it right now. Do it.</p>

<p>Obviously you realize this is absolute nonsense right?</p>

<p>The official (ever changing narrative) has yet to be proven. There is ZERO hard evidence and ZERO answers to the discrepancies that are so god damned blatant.</p>

<p>But I guess that if they have &quot;Active Shooter&quot; drills, then they would be familiar with the term. </p>

<p>And each time they would pick a 6<sup>th</sup> grader to pull the alarm. That was my goal for 5 years, to get to be the kid that they allowed to pull the alarm. For some reason that was a big fucking deal in my grade school. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it’s pretty possible the daughter texted “Mom there’s a kid shooting up the school” and the mom in relaying the story didn’t verbatim quote her daughter and instead used the term “active shooter” on her own.</p>

<p>She’s not a court reporter, she’s a mom who just spent an hour of her life thinking there’s a chance her daughter might be murdered. The last thing she’s concerned about is accurately quoting her daughter.</p>

<p>I find this issue and the responses to it upsetting.</p>

<p>I just think the idea that this is distracting from current events to be idiotic and we’re not going to invade Iraq after this so what’s the false flag reasoning?</p>

<p>17 kids died today and we’re psychoanalyzing people who god willing we will never be in a position to understand the emotions they displayed today.</p>

<p>Oh come on!!! LOL.</p>

<p>Is this a joke?</p>

<p>Holy fuck dude. That&#39;s some of the dumbest shit I&#39;ve ever read.</p>

<p>Answer me this... Has the US government ever lied to the American people about a false flag attack?</p>

<p>You and I both know the answer.</p>

<p>Second question... if they have... why do you think they would never do it again.</p>

<p>Are you aware that the US gov repealed the law preventing them from weaponizing propaganda against its own citizens in 2013?</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t aware - now you are.</p>

<p>If they&#39;ve gone to the trouble of making it legal - why do you think they wouldn&#39;t use their new available provisions?</p>

<p>Your argument has as much depth as a car park puddle.</p>
