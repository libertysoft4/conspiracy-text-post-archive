<p>With the shadow experiment Eratosthenes had to ASSUME that the Sun was millions of miles away with the rays all hitting parallel in order to make the math work out for a ball earth.  If the Sun were smaller and much closer (like it has been shown and measured to be) then it would also work on a flat plane.  Math can be reverse engineered to fit whatever model you want.  Do you not find it odd that there is no observable, detectable, or measurable curvature of Earth anywhere besides the CGI bs that NASA gives us?</p>

<p>You obviously are not familiar with the subject at all.  No, even by heliocentric math you wouldn&#39;t see curvature from a drone.  Also I can tell you haven&#39;t researched the subject because the video you linked is a balloon with a fisheye lens that distorts the horizon.  Did you not find it odd that there was a giant curved horizon when the balloon was about 50-100ft off of the ground 6 seconds into the video?  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Because drones can&#39;t fly high enough.  People have sent high altitude balloons 120,000ft and there is no visible curvature.  How high should you have to be to see curvature?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m assuming military grade spy drones could spot the curvature of the Earth at max altitude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if that were true you said &quot;you can send a drone up and measure it yourself&quot;.  None of us have access to military spy drones so even if they could go high enough (which they can&#39;t) we couldn&#39;t measure it like you say.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I know, that is why I called you out for never researching the subject.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Why do you assume there is an edge?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why does every other planet that we can see through a telescope appear circular?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why not?  That is like saying all of the billiard balls are round so the table must be round as well.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s &quot;underneath&quot; the flat Earth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The deepest that we have been able to dig is about 8 miles down.  So how would anyone know?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s the point of the conspiracy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are going all over the place on the questions and I can&#39;t go into detail on every one or my responses would be way too long.  It is better just to focus on the facts at first and don&#39;t go down the &quot;why&quot; would they lie to us questioning.  Stick to facts instead of speculation until you have studied the subject for longer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What does math have to do with taking a picture from a drone really high in the air (with a non fish eye lens of course)? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because if you claim the earth is a 25,000 mile in circumference ball then that means there is specific spherical trigonometry that you can use to know how much curvature there should be.  So do you think you should be able to see earths curvature from 50ft high? 1000ft high? 50,000ft high?  How high should you be to see the curvature?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but that video was very bad and didn&#39;t prove anything.  What did you think it proved?</p>

There should be over 500ft of curvature from that distance (this is where the spherical trigonometry math comes from that you asked about earlier).  You should not be able to see the entire Rogers Centre like you can, it should be hidden by the curvature of earth if it were there.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4oT2EbDONs&amp;amp;list=PLj_nCPZAjSmYLy78PZuFI_nRLCxsh-HfV&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;t=0s">Another video from over 31 miles away</a>  There are tons more videos of people showing evidence of no measurable curvature.

<p>Why do you assume there is an edge?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the flat earth theory is that the Earth just goes on forever?  Again, what happens if I fly my plane in a straight line?  I&#39;ll eventually come to uncharted territory that isn&#39;t mapped on any globe/map of the world?</p>

<p>Also in the original video I linked of the air balloon flying up we can see the edges of the Earth (through a fish eye lens) but that still means we were able to see the edge.</p>

<p>If the Earth goes on forever (has no edge) then how can the sun rotate around it (to cause day and night)?</p>

<p>Again, why do the poles have longer days/nights (lasting up to months at a time)?  Why are the poles colder than the rest of the planet, while places near the equator are hotter?  How come if I go North from the equator it gets colder, while at the same time if I go South from the equator it gets colder?  How would this make sense with a flat earth?</p>

<p>Why do we have uniform gravity across the surface of the Earth?  This shouldn&#39;t be the case for a non-uniform object as different places on the surface of the Earth would be different distances from the Earth&#39;s center of mass.  Yet we can go anywhere on Earth and measure the same acceleration due to gravity/gravitational force (Hint: it&#39;s because the earth is a sphere).</p>

<p>What causes the seasons to change?  In globe Earth theory it&#39;s the revolution of the Earth around the Sun.</p>

<p>Do you still believe in plate tectonics?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sorry but that video was very bad and didn&#39;t prove anything. What did you think it proved?</p>

<p>From what I could tell he looked at a building, drove to a different place still at sea level and looked at the same island without the building being visible.  Then again it&#39;s just a shitty youtube video.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Now this was actually a pretty cool video.  But the big white blob doesn&#39;t seem to be in the right location to actually be the Rogers Centre (comparing the skyline pic she shows at the end, also I&#39;m from Toronto).  Also all the buildings do look a little squished to me like their feet have been cropped out.</p>

<p>Even if that&#39;s not the case we would expect some curvature in the light waves bouncing off of the Rogers Centre towards Fort Niagara.  Light curves along with spacetime meaning that it curves when it passes by a gravitationally massive object (the earth).  For reference check out this link:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens</a></p>

<p>You still have a lot of unanswered questions regarding how the flat earth would be possible, day/night, uniform gravity, edge of the planet, how to keep such a massive conspiracy under wraps for the past few thousand years, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Again, looking forward to your response.  </p>

<p>Since there is the Antarctic treaty nobody is allowed to independently explore the Arctics to find out, so I don&#39;t claim to know.  I just find it funny when people assume there is an edge because they are conditioned to think that way.  It would be like me asking why don&#39;t you show me the edge of outerspace?  Is there an edge to outerspace?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, what happens if I fly my plane in a straight line? </p>

<p>Well if we really lived on a ball you would go untill you flew into space.  If we were on a ball pilots would have to be constantly putting the nose of the plane down or they would go off into space, think about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll eventually come to uncharted territory that isn&#39;t mapped on any globe/map of the world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should research into Admiral Byrd.  He is probably the U.S.&#39;s most famous explorer.  In the 1950&#39;s he gave an interview where he said there were uncharted and untapped resources in Antarctica larger than the U.S. So that is coming from a famous explorer that has actually been to Antarctica on expansive explorations.  Since the Antarctic treaty like I said we are not allowed to independently explore for ourselves.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also in the original video I linked of the air balloon flying up we can see the edges of the Earth (through a fish eye lens) but that still means we were able to see the edge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think you know how perspective works.  No matter how high you ascend the horizon always rises to eye level.  If we were on a ball the horizon would start to drop below eye level but it does not.  Also you can not see forever, it is visual perspective.  Just like a long hallway doesn&#39;t really get smaller until the ceiling and ground converge, that is just from perspective.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the Earth goes on forever (has no edge) then how can the sun rotate around it (to cause day and night)?</p>

<p>First of all I never claimed the earth went on forever.  I said why do you assume that there would be an edge?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, why do the poles have longer days/nights (lasting up to months at a time)? Why are the poles colder than the rest of the planet, while places near the equator are hotter? </p>

<p>Because of the path of the Sun.  The Sun is much closer than millions of miles away and moves overhead as we are stationary.</p>

<p>What is your evidence for gravity that can not be explained by density and buoyancy? </p>

<p>The path of the Sun around the Earth.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been studying the subject for about 4 years and have answered most of these questions ad nasium and can&#39;t go over every single one again.  I&#39;ve got years of reddit comment history to prove that.  I also do not claim to have every single answer on the FE theory as at this point there is no one uniform theory.  </p>

<p>You have a lot of unanswered questions regarding how a 1000mph spinning ball with water stuck to it can exist without anyone being able to observe, measure, or model it in real life.  Science should be observable, repeatable, and measurable.  Why can nobody show any measurable curvature or detect any motion of the Earth?  That should be your starting point since that is the status quo theory.  Prove earths curvature should be your starting point.    </p>

<p>There were books written calling out the heliocentric theories falsehoods in the 1800&#39;s so it has hardly been &quot;under wraps&quot; for thousands of years.  All ancient cultures knew that we lived on a flat motionless Earth.  It was only very recently in history that the heliocentric theory was pushed on us.  </p>

<p>Since there is the Antarctic treaty nobody is allowed to independently explore the Arctics to find out, so I don&#39;t claim to know. I just find it funny when people assume there is an edge because they are conditioned to think that way. It would be like me asking why don&#39;t you show me the edge of outerspace? Is there an edge to outerspace?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The treaty you&#39;re referring to makes no mention of exploration being banned, go read it for yourself.  Only thing that&#39;s banned is military activity:</p>

<p>&quot;The area is to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited but military personnel and equipment may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Article 2 – Freedom of scientific investigations and cooperation shall continue;&quot;</p>

<p>Anyways why would I have to explore the arctics.  What if I just went due West or East, would I eventually come to the edge of the Earth and fall off?</p>

<p>Also as far as we understand it the Universe does not have an edge that we could ever reach.  This could be either due to expansion or because the Universe bends in peculiar ways we don&#39;t quite understand yet.  Either way the universe is a very tricky subject that we definitely don&#39;t understand.  The Earth is a big rock.  The rock either keeps on going forever or it has an edge (or it&#39;s a sphere).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because of the path of the Sun. The Sun is much closer than millions of miles away and moves overhead as we are stationary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does China have night time when I have daytime?  If we&#39;re all on a flat surface shouldn&#39;t the sun shine on all of us at the same time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is your evidence for gravity that can not be explained by density and buoyancy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure I understand the question.  Here&#39;s the formula for gravity:</p>

<p>&quot;F = (G<em>M</em>m)/(r<sup>2)&quot;</sup></p>

<p>Where G is a constant, M and m are the masses of the objects and r<sup>2</sup> is the distance (or radius) between them (actually between their centers of gravity) squared.</p>

<p>We could just as easily remove the G and write that F is proportional to M*m/r<sup>2.</sup></p>

<p>Now since the mass of the earth is so massive compared to every object on the earth (say a bowling ball, a person, a plane) we usually find that M*m doesn&#39;t change very much no matter which object we&#39;re calculating the force of gravity due to Earth for.  So the only real value that would change the equation is the distance between the two objects centers of mass.  If the earth were a big flat block its center of mass would be in the middle (obviously).  As we moved farther from the middle of the flat earth the radius would increase and thus significantly impact force due to gravity.</p>

<p>However you can go anywhere in the world and measure either the force due to gravity (by weighing yourself on a scale, you don&#39;t weight more in different countries or different parts of the world) or you could measure the acceleration due to gravity for an object in free fall.  Either way you&#39;ll find that it always comes out to the same value no matter where you are on Earth.  That&#39;s because the Earth is a sphere so the radius between the two object&#39;s center of mass is always the same.  This would not be the case in a flat earth, unless you have an alternative explanation and equation for gravity?</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Again, why do the poles have longer days/nights (lasting up to months at a time)? Why are the poles colder than the rest of the planet, while places near the equator are hotter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the path of the Sun. The Sun is much closer than millions of miles away and moves overhead as we are stationary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the path of the sun causes the arctic to always be cold and the equator to always be hot?  How does that work?  Again, why do we have &quot;days&quot; that last for like 6 weeks in the arctic?  This is all perfectly explained by a spherical Earth (equator is closest to the sun so it&#39;s hot, poles are farthest away so they&#39;re cold).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we were on a ball pilots would have to be constantly putting the nose of the plane down or they would go off into space, think about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually gravity pulls the plane downwards because it has mass.  At a constant altitude the plane&#39;s engines and aerodynamics create enough lift to counteract the force of gravity and keep the plane flying straight and at a constant height.  Planes actually do constantly &quot;put the nose of the plane down&quot; so that they can maintain that constant cruising altitude.  Go ask any pilot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science should be observable, repeatable, and measurable. Why can nobody show any measurable curvature or detect any motion of the Earth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go look at the stars outside your house, keep track of some constellations.  Now wait 6 months and go look at that same patch of sky, you&#39;ll see different starts and different constellations.  These occurs as the Earth orbits around the sun.</p>

<p>Also it&#39;s tricky to detect the motion of the Earth because everything on the earth (including it&#39;s atmosphere) is rotating along with the Earth as well.</p>

<p>Think of when you&#39;re on a fast moving train.  Throw a ball straight  up into the air and it&#39;ll come back down to your hand.  How does that make sense if the train is moving at 100 km/h?  Shouldn&#39;t the ball have gone flying to the back of the train once I let it go?  The reason is that everything inside the train is moving at the same speed as the train itself (assuming I&#39;m standing still and not walking forwards or backwards).  Another way we could say this is that relative to the train, I am not moving (again, if im sitting still).  However relative to the trees outside I&#39;m still moving 100 km/h.</p>

<p>So when I release the ball from my hand it keeps moving at the 100 km/h it was moving at while I was holding it.  Then assuming the train doesn&#39;t slow down or speed up it&#39;ll land perfectly back in my hand (because my hand also keeps moving at 100 km/h).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All ancient cultures knew that we lived on a flat motionless Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they didn&#39;t, they figured this out by looking at the stars and their changing positions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>t was only very recently in history that the heliocentric theory was pushed on us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you believe the Earth is the center of the solar system?  How does this make sense when the mass of the sun is greater than the mass of the Earth?  Why do all the other planets follow consistent elliptical orbits around the Sun?</p>

<p>Also you conveniently keep leaving out parts of my response, I&#39;m assuming because you have no answer to my questions.</p>

<p>Thanks for the explanations but you really haven&#39;t provided any evidence that the Earth is flat.  When all of my questions can be perfectly explained (seriously, perfectly explained) by a spherical Earth and flat earth seems to be answer none of my questions then I&#39;ll continue to stick with the spherical Earth theory until some evidence to the contrary comes up.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3H7Brj5NiE">Here is an engineer that discusses the gravitational constant</a>  He has a whole series of videos called &quot;balls out physics&quot; where he goes into depth about these subjects and brings up lots of questions from a formal science background.  The bottom line is you have to have a big leap of faith to believe that gravity exists.  The Cavendish experiment has never been repeated and there is no experiment that I have found to show gravity is a real force.  Gravity is the magic fix it all for the heliocentric theory and was invented to try and fill in all of the glaring holes in the theory.    </p>

<p>I mean I showed you that there is no observable, measurable curvature.  You were under the impression that you should be able to see earths curvature from a drone.  You were not aware of the spherical triginomerty involved in the ball earth theory that you support. So I did educate you on the fact that is not possible to &quot;fly a drone high enough to see the curvature&quot;.  I&#39;m sorry but the very first step should be to prove a spinning ball earth (not prove a flat earth) since that is the status quo.  You have not provided any evidence of curvature or motion of the earth.  You can only parrot theoretical equations just like everyone else that I have this conversation with.  </p>

<p>There are so many things that don&#39;t make sense in the heliocentric theory.  You literally have to use the magic catchall &quot;gravity&quot; to try to make all of the inconsistencies work and it still doesn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>First you are assuming that things are being &quot;pulled down&quot; and are not just falling due to density and being more dense than the surrounding air.  Also many people (physicist and engineers included) believe we live in an electric universe and &quot;gravity&quot; can be explained by elecromagnetic energy.  Also there is the Aether and many other aspects that to not get proper attention when it comes to this subject.  Again I don&#39;t claim to have every answer but I do know that gravity is far from proven and even Newton was disappointed in his theory because of lack of evidence.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It actually is (an attempt at it anyways).  You made the claim earlier that the current theory &quot;explains everything perfectly&quot;.  I find that funny because for the current theory of gravity to actually work there has to be 85% &quot;dark matter&quot;.  Scientist admit they do not have any idea what dark matter is but it must exists to make the equation work. So 85% of the &quot;perfectly explained&quot; theory is unexplained but has to be put in or the theory falls apart, once again how convenient.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure I can come up with several if I get to have 85% of the equation unexplained and not understood. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t expect you to until you start researching for yourself, you shouldn&#39;t just take my word for it.  Like I said the first thing you should do if you are interested in learning more is try and prove a spinning ball earth to yourself without using NASA as a source and see what you come up with.  If we were really on a 1000mph spinning ball it should be much easier than it is.</p>

<p>From newton&#39;s laws of motion we know that an object at rest will stay at rest unless an external force is acted upon it.  What external force would cause these objects to &quot;fall due to density&quot; if not gravity?</p>

<p>This is definitely possible.  We don&#39;t claim to know what causes gravity, only that we can see its effects all around us.  Personally I think that gravity is due to the bending of spacetime around massive objects (or any object with mass).  A simple visualization would be a bowling ball on a trampoline.  Spin a marble around on the trampoline and it will eventually be pulled towards the bowling ball.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The aether was actually one of the leading scientific theories of the day.  They even designed an experiment to measure the effect that the aether would have on the transmission of light.  Much to their surprise the experiment failed to detect any evidence of the aether at all!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>even Newton was disappointed in his theory because of lack of evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He wasn&#39;t disappointed in the lack of evidence that gravity exists, he was disappointed in the lack of evidence showing how gravity works or could work.  Here&#39;s an quote from one of his letters:</p>

<p>&quot;It is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the Mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and affect other matter without mutual Contact…That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance thro&#39; a Vacuum, without the Mediation of any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity that I believe no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an Agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this Agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the Consideration of my readers.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Newton he was about 200 years too early for Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity, which is how we started to gain some more understanding on how gravity waves propagate through space-time.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>To be fair I was talking about the spherical earth theory, not gravity when I said that.  But you&#39;re right, &quot;dark matter&quot; is a great example of what you called &quot;reverse engineering the math&quot;.  We needed dark matter because there was more gravitational force being exerted than should have been possible based on the estimated observable mass of the universe.  I&#39;ve even heard the number as higher than 85%.</p>

<p>Personally I think that &quot;dark matter&quot; is complete BS.  It&#39;s nothing more than the aether theory of our time.  My personal theory is that the universe(s) that exists &quot;before&quot; a certain instance and maybe even the universe(s) that will exist in the future, &quot;after&quot; an instance, will still exert their gravitational energy on our current universe.  Gravitational waves don&#39;t care about &quot;time&quot;, they care about space-time.  This is just a theory I have from smoking too much weed though haha, no science behind it.</p>

<p>&quot;[Einstein’s theory of relativity is] a magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors.

<p>Good luck because there have already been high altitude balloons (with non fisheye lens cameras) that have been up to 120,000ft and there is no observable curvature.  Also you can go to a beach and watch a ship &quot;go over the horizon&quot; then take a Nikon p900 zoom camera (or a telescope) and bring the ship completely back into view proving it only goes out of visual perspective and not &quot;over the horizon&quot;.  There are many experiments that we can do ourselves that prove there is no curvature especially as technology gets better and cheaper.  We don&#39;t just have to rely on &quot;authority figures&quot; to tell us what reality is.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s some math---The earths tilt is 23.4 degrees. The most common angle used is 90 degrees (no one should dispute that).        90-23.4=66.6 </p>

<p>The earth rotates around the sun at 66,000 MPH (link below)     <a href="https://www.livescience.com/32294-how-fast-does-earth-move.html">https://www.livescience.com/32294-how-fast-does-earth-move.html</a>  </p>

<p>The way they measure the curvature of the earth is 8 in per mile squared. At 10 miles there is a drop of 66.6 feet and at 100 miles there is a drop of 6,666.6 feet. </p>

<p>Funny how the math adds up.</p>

<p>90* is a nice, clean angle - but there&#39;s nothing special about it. Let&#39;s not forget that 360* is a human construct in itself. I&#39;d imagine that existed long before the tilt of the earth was observed </p>

Anyone here who is a flat earth person, I would wager, disagrees with that organization and would agree that they are intended to discredit Flat Earth Theory. </p>

<p>This is different from saying Flat Earth is a psy-op to discredit conspiracy theorists, which doesn&#39;t really make sense. Why would there be a psy-op within a psy-op? The Flat Earth Society believes that earth rises at the rate of gravitational acceleration and that you can fall off the edge and all this other nonsense. </p>

<p>Think about this: if the moon landings were fake, and they were, that means the first photo of a ball earth was taken c. 1971 -- <em>and it was fake.</em> This is why the next step after you realize NASA is full of shit is to question the description of our world and its location. </p>

<p>Also there is now a radiation belt around earth that prevents people from leaving the earth yet it wasn’t a problem back then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t prevent people from going through it, only from staying in that specific belt.  Going to the moon you passed through the belt fairly quickly.</p>

<p>It effects electronics as well.  For example: The recent SpaceX launch included a 6 hour delay until the burn to some kind of solar orbit because that is the time it took to pass through that belt.</p>

<p>The belt wasn&#39;t really that well known in Apollo era either, we hadn&#39;t been actually flying satellites or people that long.  It just wasn&#39;t studied.  Its like how Voyager has &quot;left&quot; the solar system several times, because each new area discovered is later understood to be a new region of solar/galaxy wind interaction.</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t lose the technology, the people designed the engines for the Saturn V died because of old age.  We used the Shuttle instead for decades, which used different engines and technology.  Over time you just kind of lose knowledge if you don&#39;t use it.  It gets shoved into an old warehouse or something.</p>

<p>Even SLS, which kind of looks like Saturn V, has more in common with the shuttle.  Its using the Shuttle engines and solid rocket boosters instead.  Why would we use tech from the 60s anyways?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that random youtube video has Don Pettit speaking in it and I’m pretty sure he’s qualified enough to speak for nasa. Are you biased towards “random youtube videos”? Im only using his words are you saying that is not Don Pettit or did you not even watch the video? Also a “normal” car should not be able to survive in the vacuums of space with no atmosphere which is why everything nasa sends to space is made specifically for that. Using materials ranging from gold, to titanium. The fact that people actually believe this shit is laughable. </p>

<p>I did, that&#39;s why I explained why we don&#39;t have the technology to go to the moon right now.  We abandoned it in favor of using the shuttle.  In fact, the story of the shuttle has a lot more it than that.  Its technically called the Space Transport System, and originally the plans included a tug and a NERVA based interplanetary craft as well.</p>

<p>But funding for space activities crashed as public interest was lost and we ended up with just the shuttle and no funded means of moving people beyond LEO.</p>

<p>A vacuum doesn&#39;t have a temperature.  Temperature is the measurement of the heat of physical matter.  The metal and plastics of the Tesla car can more than survive the few hours it was recorded for under the conditions that would be present for it in LEO.</p>

<p>What about plastic and metal do you think cannot survive the heating from the radiation of the sun?  Do think the materials in satellites or the ISS are really that dramatically different?  The radiation of the sun would have only gradually heated the car.  And I am sure the metals of the car can survive that temperature fluctuation too, at the very least for a few hours.</p>

<p>If people had focused on stuff that was wrong instead of make the claim of flat earth then more would prob have taken it seriously. Lots of stuff you can point at, like the older footage obviously fake, geographic patterns on map repeating around world or in weather or surface of other planets, africa having very similar shape as Australia, venus giving off its own light, other astrological observations... the &quot;electric universe theory&quot; actually makes a lot of sense and found that from looking into flat earth so maybe that will get more traction.

Plus, the guy has a checkered past and definitely has some high government connections.

If it was there should be a mountain ofl evidence but really the only proof we have is everybody believes it and they tell us it is. I find it funny too because people become angry, name call and character bash instead of providing evidence. Ive been on the flat earth wagon for a year now and havnt seen a shread of evidence to change my mind. Nothing to do with being a shill or psy op. To the contrary actually. Flat earthers on here speak up and spread the truth. Those who are also truth seekers will come to the light. </p>

<p>But dude, thats not even what i asked about. <em>Planets</em> are obviously spherical and anyone can buy a telescope and see that but if you say that isn&#39;t evidence that planets are spheres then there is no penetrating your thick skull. </p>

<p>And again, you haven&#39;t given <em>any</em> information at all on this supposed dome but yet somehow the &quot;evidence&quot; suggests we live in a dome? This is rediculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a math guy myself but here is a book devoted to using math to prove the flat earth.</p>

<p>From the description on Amazon.com:</p>

<p>&quot;Spherical Trigonometry is the study of curved triangles, triangles drawn on the surface of a sphere. The subject is practical, for example, because we don&#39;t live on a sphere. The subject has numerous elegant and unexpected theorems. I give a few below. For starters... To find the curvature of the earth... You must use Stanford’s 8 Inches per Mile Squared. Using the theorem of Pythagoras a2 this number above the a means squared and has been challenged by people who do not know how to square a number. This books debunks the spinning globe theory using everyday Spherical Trigonometry.&quot;

<p>Math can be manipulated to prove/disprove numerous things so it is not the end all, be all of evidence for proof of anything, especially when it comes to outer space which uses many assumptions to create the numbers used in the equations. This video explains it better than I ever could.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard some stupid shit like NASA is profiting off spreading this lie. Yes, every NASA employee is living in a mansion throwing bank rolls at hoes.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right for one though. I do have an agenda. Promoting science and hard work. There is no money in astronomy or astrophysics unless you become a pop science guy narrating documentaries and giving lectures.</p>

<p>Science is a labor of love for most academics and researchers. It makes me mad - maybe unreasonably so - that these anti-science cults denounce the hard work of polymaths, philosophers, researchers over the millennia with half assed theories. The worst part is that it catches on with the younger generation.</p>

<p>At the same time, it&#39;s the same reason I get mad at the federal ban of many beneficial schedule A drugs. It&#39;s the same reason I get mad at doctors who look at you differently when you tell them you partake in alternative medicine and homeopathic treatment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on many points of the pharmaceutical and medical industry but we disagree on the use of math/science. While both are extremely valuable, they are easy to manipulate by TPTB to serve the purpose of misleading the masses.</p>

<p>As for NASA employees, I doubt they are all in on it but I have no way of knowing. My guess is information is compartmentalized just as it is done in the military so that people only know a small section without being able to see the bigger picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently Mount Everest&#39;s summit can be seen from as far as 336 km away. The formula d = 3.57 &amp;root;h where h is your elevation allows you to calculate how far you can see <em>without factoring in atmospheric refraction</em>.</p>

<p>Washington, DC is on the other side of the U.S. entirely. You mean Washington state.</p>

<p>Searching for the distance from Nanaimo, BC to Mount Baker I found 218 km, not 250 km. The mountain&#39;s elevation is about 3300 m. Using the above formula, one should be able to see about 205 km from the summit of Baker. However (and this is very important), this number is the distance without atmospheric refraction, which adds about 8% depending on temperature, air pressure, etc. making the actual distance more like 221 km. So, depending on conditions between Nanaimo and Mount Baker at any giving time, its visibility is not surprising, and <em>certainly</em> not evidence that the Earth is flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it seems that way as I have never met a single irl. But </p>

<p>Also what it flat earther movement is there ro teach the public about critical thought. An easy to disprove theory that at its core has one fundumental issue, a fact that only a few people have verified for themselfs irl with their own eyes. So an a level its the perfect theory to make people look at evidence and assess its legotomacy. Or a perfect way to make people complacent with the evidence they are given and to comdition them to disregard all conspiracy theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im going to say no and heres why. Flat earth is probably the grandest of all conspiracies or at least up there with the big boys. It undermines everything underpinning our lives and belief systems. If true literally everything would come crashing down.  Now we are bombarded with evidence of the heliocentric model, convincing and (if indeed untrue in part or in its entirey) well constructed. Apart from a small online presence on the fringes of the conspiracy community Flat Earth carries no weight, unlike global warming denial and antivax Flat Earth has no effect on government policy nor does it hold sway in any educational circles. On the surface it would <em>appear</em> that Flat Earth is a belief system on par with the existence of unicorns or purple dragons on Venus - it is completely benign.</p>

<p>And this leads me to question just why there is such a concerted effort on behalf of flat earth debunkers especially with such vitriolic fervour. What lead me to start to question the standard accepted model on the earth and universe was flat earth. Thats not to say I believe in a flat earth per se, but the idea of even considering such a  polarising point of view gets you to start to question, it gets you challenging the little things and challenging the innate cognative disonance ingrained in us. I&#39;m not saying I want to be spoon fed by Eric Dubay but nor am I willing to accept a false dichotemy and ignore what I perceive as issues with things like Nasa footage - I&#39;m talking about the back combed hair, signs of people on wires, blue screens, the lack on non-composite images of the Earth, lackof significant stellar parallax, lack of visable curvature at high altitudes with non-fisheye lenses and so on.</p>

<p>So yes I do see value in Flat Earth theory either as a thought experiment, a means to challenge embeded viewpoints or even just as an interesting but benign point of view to consider.</p>
