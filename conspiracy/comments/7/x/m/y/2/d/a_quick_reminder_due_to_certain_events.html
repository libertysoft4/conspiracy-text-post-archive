    <div class="md"><p>Eh, there were some slight rumblings about gun control, but with Republicans controlling every branch of government there wasn&#39;t really any major push. There was also talk of banning bumpstocks. Even Trump and the NRA were on board with that one, but no clue what ever happened with that. There was also some attempt online to blame liberals (because it was a country music concert that was attacked and clearly only conservatives like country /s). But yeah, other than that it seemed like no one wanted to touch it. I&#39;m not sure how that sits with some of the conspiracy theories though, because what better way to distract from what actually happened than to make it super political and let people fight over gun rights or mental health or whatever else you want. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The thing is, those guns would have to be bought by someone who lives in a different state (at least for handguns, which account for the vast majority of gun crime).  People who buy more than a few guns at one time or regularly buy one or two over the course of a month or year definitely get the ATF&#39;s attention.  then, that person has to cross state lines, and then sell them to people he/she <em>knows</em> are prohibited possessors.  The buying multiples at once is the only part of this that doesn&#39;t already include a felony, and doing that regularly attracts the attention of the feds.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not the lack of laws, its the disregard for laws already in place.</p>

<p>The argument that people make about owning guns to protect themselves from a tyrannical government isn&#39;t as silly as you try to make it. The objective would not be to &quot;win&quot; against the military. The objective would be to force the government / military to kill its own citizens in very large numbers in order to accomplish whatever &quot;bad thing&quot; that they&#39;re doing in any given scenario.</p>

<p>So, instead of the government / military forces being able to safely go around arresting people for no good reason, they would be met with fierce resistance and be forced to kill a lot of their own people. Would they be willing to do that? Maybe. But it&#39;s a deterrent.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t my argument - I don&#39;t own any weapons - I don&#39;t predict a future tyrannical government that would do anything on the level required to get such a reaction out of people. But you&#39;re over-simplifying what these people say.</p>

<p>Just look at what has been happening in Syria. The main point that outsiders make is that Assad is &quot;killing his own people&quot;. That&#39;s bad PR. They don&#39;t care that some of &quot;his own people&quot; are also trying to kill him. That makes these outsiders want to bomb the shit out of Assad and his military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you. idk why people see to glance over this possibility. its can explain a lot of oddities. for example i wouldnt be surprised if these things events occurred and the media wanted to push a certain narrative thus staged phone calls from people claiming to be involved in it when they actually werent and then saying things that fit the narrative or message the news wants to push. </p>

<p>for example, in the early goings a student who was present had a 2-3 minutes convo with the reporter and then the reporter randonly starts asking about his instagram and mentions that the caller posted an instagram video of the shooting. they then play the video and its actually the edited video that pauses and shows the computer screen with holes in it. so clearly not the callers video as it was the edited version to hilight the computer bullet holes. they then quickly moved onto the caller saying the shooter had used instagram to post pics of guns and &quot;other sick stuff&quot; </p>

<p>my issue is if the caller had all this video on instagram and knew all this info about the shooter, who he said he didnt know at the beginning of the interview, why not lead with all that? the interviews throughout the day seemed forced and awkward, but that in no way impacts the reality of the events, simply the calls into question the coverage and the media&#39;s credibility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What!?</p>

<p>Ok, I am not going to try to argue with what amounts to your religious beliefs, but I want to ask how you square that idea with the atomic bombs on Japan?</p>

<p>I don’t buy into any of this spiritual or satanic or otherwise magical stuff regarding politics.  These are psychopathic narcissists who are motivated by greed and pleasure, not some religious devotion imo.  The explanations for ritual abuse are easily found in the writings of <em>The Marquee de Sade</em> rather than in Aleister Crowley; the boredom of having anything you want motivates some to attempt to find thrills in the most taboo and extreme acts possible.  </p>

<p>There is a certain thrill to criminal risk for most everyone (that is why teens shoplift pointless objects or vandalize buildings).  When a person is so wealthy and powerful that they can, literally, get away with murder, there are very few ways to seek a thrill that pushes the limits or may actually provide a risk that isn’t deranged and grotesque.  (I mean others like Branson skydive and climb mountains, but there are plenty of deviants.)</p>

<p>Do you think the families are hanging around here?</p>

<p>Also, respect towards the families involves getting to the truth, whatever it may be. To get there, there is no other way than to formulate hypothesis and possibly falsifying them.</p>

<p>Amazing all these posts telling us how to think. As far as I’m concerned they are counter-productive.</p>

<p>If you intend well, you must realize the most common argument in favor of the government-peddled conspiracy on 911 is “don’t ask question because this disrespects the families”. It is a disgusting tactic they use and which exploits, for criminal purposes, the human qualities of empathy and love.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t give me that fantasy about protecting yourself against the govt--do you really think Raptisoft and his hunting rifle are going to make a difference against a drone army?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The argument that people make about owning guns to protect themselves from a tyrannical government isn&#39;t as silly as you try to make it. The objective would not be to &quot;win&quot; against the military. The objective would be to force the government / military to kill its own citizens in very large numbers in order to accomplish whatever &quot;bad thing&quot; that they&#39;re doing in any given scenario.</p>

<p>So, instead of the government / military forces being able to safely go around arresting people for no good reason, they would be met with fierce resistance and be forced to kill a lot of their own people. Would they be willing to do that? Maybe. But it&#39;s a deterrent.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t my argument - I don&#39;t own any weapons - I don&#39;t predict a future tyrannical government that would do anything on the level required to get such a reaction out of people. But you&#39;re over-simplifying what these people say.</p>

<p>Just look at what has been happening in Syria. The main point that outsiders make is that Assad is &quot;killing his own people&quot;. That&#39;s bad PR. They don&#39;t care that some of &quot;his own people&quot; are also trying to kill him. That makes these outsiders want to bomb the shit out of Assad and his military.</p>
