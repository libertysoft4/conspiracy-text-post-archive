    <div class="md"><p>We don’t vote at the polls, we vote with our dollars. While I agree some taxes should be enforced to maintain a police department, a fire department and a few other services, I think we could do away with an income tax because the USA never needed an income tax prior to 1913, but we were still seeing GDP growths of 10% a year compared to about 3% now and we were in much less debt. The idea of living in a world free from taxes is a pipe dream unless there is a violent takeover of the US government </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Local and State government budgets are well documented and often spread quite thin. This is why many states apply for federal grants and whatnot. The Federal government really doesn&#39;t have to account for what they are spending, continuously building upon the debt. While I can agree with you that tax allocation is not as transparent as far as dollar-value in service provision, the private sector alone cannot provide these social programs to those less fortunate than you and I. You can help by &quot;gifting&quot; your servers in cash and writing &quot;taxation is theft&quot; on the receipt.

Think about the popular first-person shooter games and popular movies, glorifying military combat. War is as much a part of the American landscape as apple pie and baseball. It&#39;s fucked, but our economy is reliant on perpetual military engagement. Perhaps tax allocation is the heart of your problems and with that, I can agree with. It absolutely sucks, but we have to play the game to improve it. Young people need to stay informed and engaged politically, or else the spending will remain unchecked. </p>
