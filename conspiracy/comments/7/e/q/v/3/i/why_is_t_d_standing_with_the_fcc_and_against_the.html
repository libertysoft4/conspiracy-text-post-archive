    <div class="md"><p>I can give at least some perspective! I don&#39;t use TD but I&#39;m critical of NN.</p>

<p>Regulation put us in this mess, and I think it&#39;s insane to use more regulation to address it. Government involvement in ISPs is precisely why we have these monopolies. </p>

<p>If we addressed the influence these companies have and stop giving them tax payer money then some.day we can have a truly free internet market. People are saying &quot;well you&#39;d have to pay more for HD TITTIES!&quot; but neglect to use examples like T-Mobile providing their &quot;binge on&quot; service.</p>

<p>They allow you to stream music and video on cellular data without hurting your data cap. If you have only 2GB for the month, you can watch 50GB of video without even touching your usual 2.</p>

<p>If they were an ISP this would not be allowed under NN. This is a service that is good for consumers and encourages competition between T-Mobile and other phone plan providers.</p>

<p>Without NN, old people would be allowed to buy a cheaper package that gives them access to their email and Facebook rather than paying 100 per month for the same service that a hardcore gamer uses.</p>

<p>No NN <em>could</em> be a good thing if we address other issues. I personally think we should let ISPs run wild and put themselves to bed one day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that’s precisely it.  No more will 15mbps of bandwidth mean that you can download data from any site at a rate of 15mbps.  Instead, you will be charged based on which sites and services you’re accessing. </p>

<p>This is in complete misalignment with the internet’s infrastructure, and how networking in general works. </p>

<p>Imagine if your car performed based on the destination of your travel. If you paid for the Disney package, you could drive down the public streets at 100% of the speed limit, but not to Sea World. For destinations not in the Disney pack, your car is limited artificially to 10% of the posted speed limit. </p>

<p>That’s what they want to do to you - sell you 100mbit service to your house, and reduce the performance to e.g. 10mbit for anything not on their list of approved destinations.   In the back-end, no internet infrastructure is plumbed this way. This is an artificial mechanism entirely about billing you more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>T-Mobile&#39;s binge on service is exactly what T-Mobile wants you to think of as a positive example of net neutrality. Never mind negatives, like this:</p>

<pre><code>There&#39;s nothing hypothetical about what ISPs will do when net neutrality is eliminated. I&#39;m going to steal a comment previously posted by /u/Skrattybones and repost here:

2005 - Madison River Communications was blocking VOIP services. The FCC put a stop to it.

2005 - Comcast was denying access to p2p services without notifying customers.

2007-2009 - AT&amp;amp;T was having Skype and other VOIPs blocked because they didn&#39;t like there was competition for their cellphones.
2011 - MetroPCS tried to block all streaming except youtube. (edit: they actually sued the FCC over this)

2011-2013, AT&amp;amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon were blocking access to Google Wallet because it competed with their bullshit. edit: this one happened literally months after the trio were busted collaborating with Google to block apps from the android marketplace

2012, Verizon was demanding google block tethering apps on android because it let owners avoid their $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn&#39;t do that as part of a winning bid on an airwaves auction. (edit: they were fined $1.25million over this)

2012, AT&amp;amp;T - tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money.

2013, Verizon literally stated that the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the net neutrality rules in place.

The foundation of Reason&#39;s argument is that Net Neutrality is unnecessary because we&#39;ve never had issues without it. I think this timeline shows just how crucial it really is to a free and open internet.

<p>So I&#39;m confused, this seems to point out the FCC was stopping violations, which is what they want to go back to.  </p>

<p>Considering regulatory capture is almost a sure thing, wouldn&#39;t keeping regulations allow for Comcast/TW/etc to lobby to create/change the regulations in their favor, keeping out smaller competition?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s only a short term benefit for consumers. Allowing certain services to not count against your monthly data limit allows major companies to choose winners and losers and control the ways you take in information. Competitor services that pop up against the ones that are already zero-rated now have institutional barriers set up that mean that potential customers are punished for using their services. </p>

<p>Allowing something like Netflix to be zero rated is great and all in the moment, but when it means that there are barriers to entry stopping any potential competitor from being able to compete on an even ground, then in the long run, it&#39;s really screwing us over.</p>

<p>ISP&#39;s are already allowed to provide differing plans based off of speed and amount of data used. There&#39;s just absolutely no reason to allow discrimination based off of the destination or origin of your packets. Gaming bits are no different than e-mail bits. </p>

<p>Grandma is absolutely allowed to purchase a low speed Internet service with a low data cap that e-mail would never reach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right. They care about profit and want money. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re in it for anyone but themselves and it would be foolish to believe otherwise.</p>

<p>What I also think is that their desire to make a profit is directly dependent on people willing to give them money. If you have no regulations and a company (Provided we break up the monopolies) acts shitty, people just shop somewhere else. </p>

<p>People hated cable and we got Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and others.</p>

<p>People hated expensive phone companies who got rid of unlimited data and then we got players like Cricket and T-Mobile who really shook things up.</p>

<p>People hate Verizon and Comcast. Right now it&#39;s really hard for others to get involved. Do we pass laws that make it so only Verizon and Comcast can provide not-completely-shitty service, or is it better to ease the process of entry into the market and let the companies battle it out for consumers? What&#39;s worked best in the past?</p>

<p>Outside of that, let corporations do whatever they please with their service as long as they aren&#39;t infringing on other people&#39;s rights.</p>

<p>There are so libertarian purists who would likely disagree, but there&#39;s a point where the free market does need a bit of guidance in order for it to work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On January 14, 2014, the DC Circuit Court determined in the case of Verizon Communications Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission[56][57] that the FCC had no authority to enforce network neutrality rules as long as service providers were not identified as &quot;common carriers&quot;.[58]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FCC then responded by classifying ISP&#39;s as common carriers which is exactly what Pai wants to undo now.</p>

<p>If Pai succeeds in repealing the rules implemented in 2015 the internet will <strong>not</strong> be the same as it was pre 2015.</p>

<p>You were concerned that Net Neutrality would stall competition. I&#39;m trying to demonstrate that that is not true.</p>

<p>Google is not afraid of Net Neutrality anymore since they are rolling out their own ISP via Google Fiber and Google Loom. Google actually stands to gain from the removal of Net Neutrality this time which is why they are not fighting back as hard as they did in <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/sopa-pipa">2012</a>.</p>

<p>Yes I agree, but I really started to notice a difference in conspiracy talk around 2013-now. It’s escalated but before even infowars seemed anti globalist where as now it is basically alt right.
Both parties are not the same... it’s definitely worse now but you can listen to  an account by a general from the bush era where he was told we just need this war with Iraq. The GOP since Reagan has only been concerned with making the rich richer. I would only say Bush senior was any different. He knew the trickle down economic policy was absolute bullshit.</p>

<p>By this logic Scientology never claiming to be a place for free and open thought is better than something that does and fails in any respect. In practice this is just not true. It&#39;s a fast-track to cult behavior. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also ridiculous to call &quot;The Donald&quot; simply a fanpage. It&#39;s not. People are sincerely affecting their opinions about the larger world of politics and culture based on it. To steal the example (in the other direction) of a lower comment- If the users of Sandra Bullock&#39;s &quot;fanpage&quot; were making serious decisions and attempting to cause political and cultural changed based on fascistic cult-thinking, it would be no less creepy.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s why:</p>

<p>If there was a news channel called
&quot;PropagandaTV&quot;, it doesn&#39;t matter if the name is honest,
the content can still be dishonest.</p>

<p>Plus, &quot;The_Donald&quot; doesn&#39;t really clarify truthfully
what it is.
There&#39;s a big difference between 
a sub that believes Trump is playing 4D chess
but questions everything VS a cult sub which bans
THE SLIGHTEST of dissent.</p>

<p>Also, when people go to T_D
they don&#39;t really remember they&#39;re entering an echo chamber
with bots, shills, brainwashed people, zionist warmonger mods, etc.
(divide and conquer propaganda is also common there, like the manipulative thread tag &quot;violent left&quot;
as I&#39;ve seen).</p>

<p>It&#39;s not something that enters the consciousness.
And that&#39;s only the smarter ones.
The dumber ones think it&#39;s 100% legit
and think in stupid liberal vs conservative lenses (corporate false paradigm).
When both parties are corrupt, there&#39;s no left, center or moderate right.
It&#39;s just corporate extremism.</p>

<p>/T_D and /politics are both dangerous. 
Dissent gets you downvoted or banned.
I get that a 24/7 rally for Trump fans sounds good
and I sympathize, but it can really brainwash people.</p>

<p>Just my view. I don&#39;t actually have a solution,
I&#39;m just saying T_D can&#39;t be defended as it&#39;s anti-free speech
and infested with shills and bots.
I don&#39;t see one as better than the other.
Both of those shill subs are toxic.</p>

Ocean cables are not protected by government monopolies as far as I know, so anyone that wants in on that action is more than free to take that risk.

<p>I read this as: Little Johnny has some anger problems, so we are going to lock him up in the basement indefinitely to control him. We over-fixed the initial problem, and now we may have caused bigger problems down the road for Johnny as we broke him in worse ways while trying to fix him.</p>

<p>The way it was before Title 2 is no longer a possible option because that framework was overturned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#Narrowing_of_FCC.27s_authority_.282014.29">court</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On January 14, 2014, the DC Circuit Court determined in the case of Verizon Communications Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission[56][57] that the FCC had no authority to enforce network neutrality rules as long as service providers were not identified as &quot;common carriers&quot;.[58]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take a nuanced stance that Net Neutrality has both pros and cons. It is not a 100% bad nor is it 100% good.</p>

<p>The Pros of Net Neutrality: network throttling is banned as all traffic on the internet must be treated equally. By extension these rules prevents the creation of a tiered internet with fast lanes and slow lanes and allows small time competitors to compete with the big boys. The Wikileaks page will load as fast as CNN or Fox news.</p>

<p>The Cons of Net Neutrality is that certain large corporations like Netflix and Amazon are taking advantage of the situation as their business models rely on other users subsidizing their bandwidth usage. Even if you don&#39;t subscribe to Netflix and Amazon you are forced to pay for it regardless through your ISP. You pay the same rate for &quot;unlimited&quot; internet as someone who is streaming Terabytes worth of HD movies every month. It was predicted that this would stifle &quot;the great buildout&quot; (investment in telecomm infrastructure) because why invest in a fish that gets eaten by other fish? Investment flowed to the top-level predator (Amazon) who got the benefit of the buildout but shared no expense in it&#39;s creation.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is George Soros is supporting net neutrality and it is very rare that Soros is ever on the right side of history. Jeff Bezos is also pure evil as his corporation Amazon has killed millions of jobs and is responsible for the <strong>Dead Mall phenomenon</strong> spreading across America. Amazon has cheated billions in state and local taxes by not charging sales tax on their products. Your local taxes then have to increase to make up the difference in lost revenue to continue to pay for schools and other government services. Amazon is a parasite organization through and through. </p>

<p>Conclusion: I have recently swung my opinion from the pro column to the anti column as recently as just the last few hours. This debate over net neutrality feels like gaslighting as the body public has been convinced to support a greater evil. The removal of net Neutrality will not silence the truth as potential blocked websites can still be reached via VPNs. The idea of massively censored internet is groundless fear mongering. The truth will still get out to be discussed here and on other websites.</p>

Dismantling net neutrality just gives them even more control in terms of specific, pre-determined websites that you visit. People are acting like this is purely about dollars and cents. It&#39;s more than that. It&#39;s about control. Once it&#39;s gone it&#39;s never coming back. </p>

<p>Any potential blocked website can still be accessed with a VPN and they are never doing to block a major website like Reddit or Twitter so stop the fear mongering. This is about cutting down Amazon and Netflix from getting a free ride on the backs of other paying internet users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my understanding of the Net Neutrality situation (and why T_D is against Net Neutrality)...NN primarily benefits large media companies. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/20/14960154/netflix-net-neutrality-stances-timeline">Netflix for example.</a></p>

<p>These media companies are using the internet infrastructure for strictly commercial (profit-making) purposes as opposed to others who use the internet for mixed communication and sharing (universities, personal email, gaming, etc).</p>

<p>So basically, while most of us are using the internet for work and fun, Big Media is kind of piggybacking, using the internet as a &quot;free&quot; distribution network. Think about it. Netflix doesn&#39;t PAY ANYTHING to get that content to you. You&#39;re paying Netflix for the content, and AT&amp;T for the hardware to get it to you.</p>

<p>What Net Neutrality is doing is preventing ISP&#39;s from charging Big Media more for their commercial traffic. This results in <em>all of us</em> having to pay more to the ISP&#39;s. With Net Neutrality, Big Media is basically shifting their distribution costs onto everyone else.</p>

<p>Like if I&#39;m delivering pastries for a church charity, I&#39;ll give them a better deal than if Entenmann&#39;s hired me to ship coffee cakes.</p>

<p>Totally understandable, but in this situation today there&#39;s no need to give better or worse deals. You simply transmit the information. I think that&#39;s what everyone hopes the internet remains, a neutral pipe providing what you requested.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean what if (totally hypothetically) charging media providers more ended up in a drop in rates for non-media ISP accounts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, sure. That&#39;s a valid hope. But I&#39;d rather keep paying what I am today and have unfettered access to the information I want. Without Net Neutrality the ISPs can pick and choose what news or information I can access.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check it out people... net neutrality was a cover for the &quot;Fairness Doctrine&quot; to be implemented... to silence people looking for truth and reporting it. Hidden under a name and a cover story to make in  it sound like it was something for the common man. Don&#39;t fall the false narratives. Research what the controversy about it was before it was rammed down our throats. Look who is pushing you to protest the repeal. Follow the money, the massive reports of bots trying to get you to fight for the ultimate suppression of your free speech. Why is a certain wealthy person throwing money at this.

    <div class="md"><p>This thread is filled with noise and information bubbles.</p>

<p>Most everyone has the same position on NN.</p>

<p>However, T_D, is also censored. Twitter and Facebook are heavily anti-trump. Every day is a smear campaign on Twitter&#39;s front page. All I see T_D doing is point out how censored they are and their opinion (it&#39;s an opinion is not a fan-page) and going on to make the point of... Well, we don&#39;t like what happened to our community (T_D), but your opposed to NN which is just as much about censorship and media manipulation as it is MONEY.</p>

<p>The only place I can get information on THE GOOD Donald Trump is doing with his Presidency is T_D, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> has spin, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> has spin, all the mods are heavily left.</p>

<p>Often time&#39;s posts from news get x-posted to T_D for how much the comments in a normal sub are beginning to align with the &#39;alt-right&#39; perspective of T_D.</p>

<p>The end of net neutrality will be the end of internet freedom as we know it. Share information on 9/11, Sandy Hook, Las Vegas shooting. All of these things will be easier to clamp down on when this goes full force.</p>

<p>I want all of us to win. I want T_D posts to show up on reddit front page again though too, so other visitors to this website can get another perspective that what the mainstream media projects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright- I&#39;ll bite: Net Neutrality is horse shit.</p>

<p>Telecom industry has lobbied themselves into monopolies. How do you break up a monopoly? Allow competition. Why isn&#39;t the issue of local municipalities getting sued out of providing their own network getting more attention? Why are pole rights fought so hard for by the telecom giants, despite our tax dollars putting up those poles? They don&#39;t want competition, and getting the people to fight over this frivolous, do-nothing Net Neutrality takes all of the attention away from the real issue-- the lack of competition for ISPs. They win whether or not NN gets enforced, as long as people are talking about it.</p>

<p>Instead of deregulating the industry and allowing others to provide their own services (yay, free market!), we pass this pair of plastic handcuffs onto this monster that&#39;s been getting fed regulatory steroids for decades. Oh, and the best part--- everyone&#39;s been fooled into believing this giant ruse is really the answer to our network woes. The idea of allowing real competition in the marketplace just got shelved for another 5-10 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bandaid doesn&#39;t do anything to prevent a broken bone from healing, but it doesn&#39;t help any either- and that&#39;s my point. NN is a diversion to prevent any real change from taking place by the telecom giants-- and it&#39;s worked perfectly. </p>

<p>It has every technocrat on the internet convinced this is THE battle to save the internet, because apparently today&#39;s technocrats don&#39;t know god-damn fuck-all about legislation or principles of freedom, or common practices of industry manipulation (myself included there for a while)- when it&#39;s really just one toothless regulation that&#39;s been intentionally hyped by the masses. You want real change? Let the ISPs compete for you business, instead of being assigned to your area. Throttling would never appear in a free market.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my fucking problem. Net neutrality is seen as a take-all battle between the honest will of the people VS evil capitalism (gfd) when it&#39;s really Netflix vs Comcast. It&#39;s a diversion. It will solve nothing. Your internet freedoms and liberties will continue to be stripped with or without NN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think back to using the Internet in the 90&#39;s &amp; early 2000&#39;s... &quot;Net neutrality,&quot; as it exists today, was not a thing. The <strong>potential</strong> for throttling and restricted access was there, but it did not happen. Net neutrality came in recently as a government control to fix a <strong>potential</strong> problem, that doesn&#39;t yet exist. </p>

<p>IMO, I like the Internet better 15-20 years ago when it was more &quot;wild west-ish&quot; ... I&#39;d be interested in standing with the FCC for that reason. If the scenario presented itself where ISP&#39;s abused this as everyone is afraid of, then the rules can be put back in place. I don&#39;t understand why everyone is treating this like it&#39;s the end of the world, for good, and the worst case scenario is definitely happening.... seems a little pessimistic. </p>

Now Comcast not only provides the internet (Xfinity) but also creates it&#39;s own content (nbc). Now tell me, as a business if they&#39;re allowed to, why wouldn&#39;t they disrupt a competitors streaming service (Netflix) to persuade you to use their own? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry, once the ISP&#39;s get all their &quot;internet packages&quot; together they will be purging /pol/ and other conservatives from the internet. Reddit will be made to ban the T_D subreddit in order to continue operating or ISP&#39;s will refuse to do business.</p>

<p>Every ISP has opposed Trump (they donated to Hillary), but they supported his pick for FCC. Trump supporters were just useful tools, now that they&#39;ve got what they want they will dispose of them.</p>

<p>ISP&#39;s/Telecoms are all about getting advertising revenue. A subreddit spamming memes and offensives shit for the sake of being offensive us not good for advertisers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same reason why we see the same exact post about Nestle and water in Michigan on this sub get 1,000 upvotes. </p>

<p>Topics are gamed. The average T_D is most likely against it, just like anyone here doesn&#39;t give a shit that there is a water pump in Michigan. </p>

<p>But there are people that want you to think a specific way, and for only a few hindered bucks they can make you &quot;think&quot; that you should &quot;think&quot; that way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah and its really sad. last night in one of the threads that the mods sickie there was a good post talking about it from a pure right wing perspective on why to be pro NN, and how NN isn&#39;t a government take over and how the government actually did something good for a change, and it got deleted when i was writing a response back to it to add more because I agreed with the user.  </p>

<p>and he wasn&#39;t even a &quot;concerned troll.&quot; he was a real trump supporter with a long history of pro-trump posts.  </p>

<p>i hate it when left-leaning people right off actual valid, good points of view from right-leaning people simply because it came from a &quot;right-wringer.&quot; and i <em>hate</em> it when right-leaning people do the <strong><em>same</em></strong>. this issue isn&#39;t even right or left. this issue is politically neutral. </p>
