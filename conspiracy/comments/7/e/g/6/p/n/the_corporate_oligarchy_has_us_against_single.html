    <div class="md"><p>Its absolutely a conspiracy but good luck getting political commentators / leftists / economists to talk about it like that.  Or even other conspiracy theorists!</p>

<p>I think we should be looking more closely at what private corporations are doing because that is clearly where the action is, conspiracy wise.  What happens in washington is basically stage management at this point, theater.  (Unless we are talking about what the intelligence agencies are  doing or what is going on inside the pentagon.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is probably what they will do to mesmerize the growing number of people who support Sanders and are joining the DSA.  That does not mean they will actually do it in office -- they can always point at the Republicans and say, &quot;they wouldn&#39;t let us do it!&quot;</p>

<p>The democrats routinely kill healthcare legislation like a public option during obama&#39;s first time, and legislation that even far right republicans support, such as the bill which would make it legal for americans to buy their perscription drugs from Canada.  Even now most of them won&#39;t make even a symbolic show of support for Sanders&#39; medicare for all bill.</p>

<p>The democrats will not do anything to help anyone.  Their job is to neutralize leftist political movements and shut down popular political policies that are left of the desires of the ruling class.  If single payer or a public option ever comes to america, it will be in spite of the democrats, and anyone who is serious about fixing the american health care system should abandon the democratic party and their internal politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was only reluctantly added to the platform in 2016 because of Sander&#39;s campaign -- it would not have been on there otherwise.  This is the party which openly and unapologetically cheated in their own primary elections to elevate a woman who said that single payer was impossible and would never happen in the United States. Then when she suddenly starts supporting a public option in the middle of a political campaign against a leftist insurgent, we are supposed to believe the party is serious about fighting for a public option?  The party that cheated to sabotage a real reformer in favor of a woman who literally told her wall street masters that she has a public position and another, different, private position?  You need to stop playing their game imo.  They work for the health insurance companies.</p>

<p>Dude, <em>what</em>? That is literally <em>all leftists talk about</em>. This is why socialists advocate for socialism, because ownership of capital in our society is equivalent to ownership of power, and that power has been and always <em>will be</em> leveraged against the working class. </p>

<p>Even forgetting <em>socialism</em>, if you want &quot;pro capitalism, but anti-corporate/&quot;big capital&quot;, that&#39;s pretty much descriptive of other leftie ideologies like Left-Wing Market Anarchism, which opposes corporations on the grounds that they give undeserved and unfair state privileges to specific businesses. </p>

<p>Liberals are shitty treacherous dogs who&#39;d all us all out for a good speech and a song, but <em>leftists</em> are absolutely the staunchest opponents of oligarchy in existence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand me, I agree with much of your post and definitely leftists are interested in and talk about the stuff the OP is talking about.  What I meant to say before, is that leftists DONT talk about power in terms of a conspiracy theory.  They talk about it in a number of different ways, none of which are satisfactory and none of which offer any solutions in my view (you may or may not agree, but that isn&#39;t even the point I&#39;m arguing for now, I just mention it to explain where I&#39;m coming from).</p>

<p>The reason why I called out leftists in my post is because I think a &#39;conspiracy&#39; way-of-thinking (if you can kind of understand what I&#39;m talking about?) is missing from their critique of power.  Like I&#39;d like to see them start mapping out power relationships on a bulletin board with notecards connected by string, talking about specific people and specific institutions, concrete problems, instead of german idealism and &#39;capital&#39;, in the case of the marxists.  Leftists seem to be really averse to conspiracy-minded thinking, for some reason.  Chomsky is a good example.</p>

<p>Anyway we can discuss this more at length if you want but I just wanted to clarify what I was saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently took an economics class. The professor explained that economists have been using super computers for years to determine how to set prices on a regional scale. This formula takes into account rent and property costs and salary then the products are  all assigned a category and percentage. So if you live in a low property cost area your food might be more expensive or cars might be more expensive.if you live in a high cost of living area then your food might be cheaper or maybe daycares are cheaper but your rent is very expensive. This is why no matter if you are college educated or a tradesmen everyone is trapped. When the professor talked about this I thought how is this capitalism? It&#39;s price fixing and gouging and it is done on a massive scale by these global conglomerates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sounds like bs. If you&#39;re in a low property value area, in other words a low income area, there&#39;s a lower limit to how high you can set your prices before people stop buying products.  In a high property value area, you can set prices much higher while keeping customers.  The assumption made is that the people in the low property value and high property value regions have the same income when they most likely don&#39;t.  This is why people complain about gentrification; when property values start to go up in a low income neighborhood, higher priced businesses open up because they now have the opportunity of reaching a higher income clientele.  Also if there are regional differences in prices on certain goods, it opens up arbitrage opportunities which tightens the spread between the low price where the product is bought and the high price where it is sold.  Price gouging isn&#39;t unethical and the only entity that fixes prices is the Government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to think bigger. The computer models take wages into account, they know where people shop and who their target customer is. People on government assistance shop in the dollar store people who earn more shop in upscale stores. Price gouging is unethical if you charge one price to people in one income bracket and a different price to those in a different bracket. Price fixing is done by corporations all the time just look at pharma and health care. The government enables this. In fact I will go a step further in medical industry the correct term is predatory pricing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re agreeing with me to an extent.  What you said before was they charge lower prices for certain goods in high property value areas, and higher prices for the same goods in low property value areas.  What you&#39;re saying now seems to be that they charge higher prices in high income areas, and lower prices in low income areas.  I don&#39;t think this is unethical primarily because every transaction is voluntary, but people can also travel to different neighborhoods if the prices are that much better and competition will undercut artificially inflated prices.</p>

<p>As for price gouging, it is necessary when there are supply shortages.  For instance, during the recent hurricanes there were shortages of food and water.  Higher prices for those goods will entice producers to bring food and water to the area, because it is profitable to do so.  Same thing with Uber&#39;s &quot;surge&quot; pricing -- it entices drivers to give rides during emergencies, like the Sydney terrorist attack, which the drivers deserve because they are putting themselves in danger.  When it comes to medications, say for rare diseases, it is necessary for pharma corps to charge high prices in order to recoup the R&amp;D costs to produce the drugs in the first place, and when very few people have the disease the cost is spread over less people.  There is more research I need to do into healthcare, insurance and the government&#39;s involvement with it though so I don&#39;t have much else to say about that issue.</p>

<p>And no I don&#39;t work for a corporation haha, I&#39;m just interested in economics.  I follow the Austrian school, we get maligned quite often but if you&#39;re interested you can learn more at <a href="https://mises.org/">mises.org</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Setting prices on a regional scale is not a neighborhood price a region of a country is vast. Not based on a neighborhood. Again we are not talking about a mom and pop shop selling milk. This is a complex system in which one area will charge a range for automobiles and a different range for insurance. Both are needs and it is not feasible to drive to another region however many dealers do just that. They purchase cars in a lower priced region and resell them in higher priced region. That is simple business and profits. This is common knowledge. What is not common knowledge is that these prices are set based on ability to pay as assessed by a super computer in conjunction with other goods so that everyone gets a slice of the pie. It is done with disclosure to the consumer. There are no consumer groups that can negotiate prices or rates and there is no way for the consumer to not buy necessities. I am not questioning that a company can set their price, I have a problem with them using income data mined on a broad scale and sharing data among other conglomerates while the consumer has no recourse to influence those prices. Necessities are not wants and must be bought....we are not talking about tv&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are not making an educated guess though. Data mining eliminates the guess work. If you need food whether you like it or not you are going to pay 24% of your income in food. There is no choice when it comes to basic needs. So the price is not set based on cost but rather solid data of how much you have in your wallet. That might not creep you out but most people would be very disturbed that conglomerates are basing price on ability to pay and not costs. In addition this is how hospitals set their prices, if an insurance pays out 1000 for a test then that test is priced at 1000, another persons insurance pays only 500 for that same test. The actual term for setting prices based on insurances pay scales is called predatory pricing. It is considered very unethical. To do that to a consumer without disclosing it is predatory and not transparent. </p>

<p>Most people who pay attention and are objectively rational realized that he would be ineffectual if not a disaster. There were tons of people, from both sides of the isle, talking about how bad he would be.</p>

<p>The guy consistently verifiably lied. The guy consistently made remarks that made it clear that he didn&#39;t understand. They guy consistently revealed that he didn&#39;t have the temperament for the job. We are in a period of anti-establishment, which is understandable, but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t dumb to vote for any damn fool who walks in off the street simply because they are anti-establishment.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame them for not being hopeful, I was hoping I was wrong about it, but I do blame them for not paying attention or not thinking about it rationally.</p>

I&#39;m leaning toward a combination of 1 and 2. The US has grown soft in terms of protest, at least since Vietnam was the last major revolutionary/violent protesting. A departure from the twoparty system with some heavy/extreme protesting overshadowing the recent women&#39;s march would be a good step. &quot;Guide to Civil Disobedience&quot; is my recommended read for everyone.  </p>

<p>Bitcoin will likely continue to rise on its own with the &quot;Ubering&quot; Peer-to-peer markets of remaining industries throughout the next few decades. With luck, the financial/economic repercussions of parallel currencies can shatter governments and industries. We would just need to embrace it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conflating health insurance with the whole of the issue of access to healthcare is a bit nonsensical. Insurance companies are only part of the issue. It&#39;s just not that simple. Calling for single payer healthcare as a response to rising healthcare costs is like putting out a campfire with a fire hose. To investigate the issue completely, you have to look at the whole of the west. International pharmaceutical corporations sell to an array of markets, some with more price regulations than others. To make up for lost profits from regulated markets, they over charge unregulated markets. Your $25 pain medicine in the UK is part of why the same medicine costs me $75 in America, when the price needs to be about $50. Price regulations on international companies have to take into consideration international markets. 100 years ago if you tried to put a price ceilings on domestic drugs that made the production of drugs unprofitable, you couldn&#39;t do it. You&#39;d kill the industry. Nowadays you can get away with it no problem, they&#39;ll just subsidize the lost profits by charging more in another market in another country.</p>

<p>Healthcare facility costs are excessive, overly grandiose and decadent. There is a greater emphasis on amenities and luxury than healthcare. Go to a Baylor facility, you&#39;ll get what I&#39;m saying right away-you&#39;d think these were Ivy League university campuses or something. The only way around this is to go to more humble facilities and hope you are still getting great care.</p>

<p>Medical supply manufacturers overcharge healthcare companies, to the extent that something like $20 forceps end up being $700 forceps on a medical bill. This needs to stop, there need to be maximum prices for the sale of these products.</p>

<p>Health insurance companies should be subject to federal mandates to provide care for people with pre-existing conditions. Period. The taking on of such patients should provide a tax credit to compensate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s your health, not a sports car.</p>

<p>If the US were to implement single pay health care, it&#39;d just make each State it&#39;s own independent care provider. You guys have 50 states and they&#39;d all be doing the same thing which is buying in bulk and shopping around for the best bang for the buck products.

<p>True. You&#39;re just confused about providers.</p>

<p>Making a State government a health care provider instead of the myriad of insurance companies makes it way easier to eliminate a lot of the red tape which is a huge waste of money.</p>

<p>Anyways, you still need companies to sell products. They still compete against other companies. It&#39;s just that the Government pays them rather than the insurance companies.</p>

<p>As for innovation, I&#39;d call that a wash. Free market brings innovation, but not the kind that benefits people. Free market health care favours innovation in search of better profits.

<p>So he thought that, not many others would say the same. </p>

<p>So your stance is more deregulation would improve things for the patients? When in other countries the opposite is proven true?</p>

<p>You americans really love to hate on things that are in your best interest. Always in favour of deregulation and hate socialized programs. Well your love of deregulation just lost you guys net neutrality. When will you guys learn, deregulation only works in an altruistic universe. In reality it gives corporations extra power to fuck you in the ass. Whether it is telecoms or big pharma or insurance companies. The only thing keeping them from fucking you is regulations and socialization.</p>

<p>Am Canadian. I love our health care. You have no idea how nice it is to not worry about if you can afford treatment or not.</p>

<p>The fact that you guys in the US don&#39;t have sane healthcare yet makes me sad but also pisses me off because your healthcare system affects our system. There&#39;s a lot of wealthy entities wanting to weasel in on Canada&#39;s health care and shift it to a pay for play system like the US. Fuck everything about that.</p>

<p>What makes you think it&#39;s bad?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is seriously pathetic that we don&#39;t have proper universal healthcare yet. We are supposed to be the top nation in the world yet we can&#39;t even pay for peoples hospital bills. They need to seriously rework the whole healthcare system from top to bottom.... you know a regular routine blood test costs like $200? An ambulance ride is like $800. These prices are ridiculous. </p>

<p>We as a country should unite and push this issue to the extreme. I want my taxes to pay for local stuff, health and education of community, not wars in foreign countries. Make it happen. Universal healthcare is possible, the Medicaid/medical assistance program that gives you several choices to pick from works very well while still incorporating most of the existing health insurance companies (under gov&#39;t supervision). </p>

<p>Other focus should be education. Free breakfast/lunch for poor kids, free daycare, improved studies, more in depth &quot;health&quot; class that goes over wider variety of subjects like career choices, planning your money, how to do basic taxes, with more emphasis on safe sex since way too many people having kids who shouldn&#39;t. Scholarship incentives for poor kids. Lower tuition across the board for colleges. </p>

<p>We spend billions on military and americans get dicked. Why the fuck do people keep letting this happen? Instead we argue with each other about stupid, useless shit like race or gender.... which are non-issues since both can succeed and have no barrier to success anymore. </p>

<p>People need to vote every 2 years too, congress is just as important if not more then the president. I wish they would just clean house and replace them ALL with new candidates. Greed has made me sick of these damn politicians.... they must be seriously in debt or have done some fucked up shit and being blackmailed to be this arrogant. </p>

<p>The corrupt republicans will have corporations ruining the government, and the corrupt democrats will just end up with the same thing but corrupt government officials with corporate backing screwing shit up... either way americans get fucked. I keep hearing that we need a third party, and I&#39;m all for libertarians getting in the mix, but they don&#39;t seem to support stuff like healthcare or programs/aide for low income people.... democrat seems like the best way to lean but they need to clean house. </p>

<p>Really? Damn.</p>

<p>Every blood test I&#39;ve had through several illnesses over the decades, I&#39;ve not paid for a single one. My last suicide attempt? Ambulance showed up, took me to hospital, I thanked them and they went on their way to help someone else. Never had to pay for it. Tests and treatment for a cancer scare, depression, even minor surgery?</p>

<p>Never paid a penny. Not directly, as a bill for service, at least. More as part of my taxes, if anything.</p>

<p>I love the NHS. Still pretty shocking that basic affordable healthcare isn&#39;t a thing in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, well that is how much those services usually are charged for, but insurance will pay some or all of it.... like the blood test will be $20-30 out of pocket. Doctors and hospitals tend to overcharge for stuff because insurance companies don&#39;t pay the full amount, say only 65% of it, and depending on your plan you may or may not have to pay the rest. </p>

<p>Its all just too expensive, doctors should charge less, insurance should pay more, pharm meds should cost less, and patients should pay less out of pocket. There will be pushback but its gotta be done. </p>
