        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m seeing a lot of people arguing (or maybe insinuating is a better word) that since shills like soros / democratic party fund raising groups / massive IT corporations support net neutrality, then we ought to fight against them and oppose it.  Those are all terrible and powerful people and institutions, and its right to be suspicious of them.  BUT, this is quintessential divide and conquer, wouldn&#39;t you say?  I mean if this isn&#39;t divide and conquer then what is?  Without even commenting on if net neutrality is good or bad, its clear they are trying to get us to focus on partisan identity issues rather than the substance of the net neutrality issue.</p>

<p>Its not an actual criticism of net neutrality and illuminates nothing about ways in which net neutrality is good or bad.   The net neutrality issue is clearly more complicated than &#39;look at what THEY are pushing for&#39; since even many massively powerful institutions are at odds with each other over it.  Remember, there are some pretty powerful forces behind the campaign against net neutrality as well, most prominently the telecommunications cartel. I wonder if some people are so far-gone they no longer regard these telecomm giants with the same suspicion they have for &#39;the other side&#39;?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying its a foregone conclusion that net neutrality is good (though I will say I support it just so you know where I&#39;m coming from) but what we are seeing here is a partisan misdirection, a completely insubstantial sleight of hand.  Whats more, it seems like a calculated, weaponized idea designed to capture a certain demographic.  And given its worthlessness as an actual argument, I find it hard to believe the idea was conceived in good faith.  So where is it coming from, and who is behind it?  How do targeted and calculating ideological weapons like this penetrate certain communities?  This divide and conquer psy op is unfolding before our eyes, and once again, these same old tricks continue to work!</p>

<p>Edit: Big surprise this thread is getting down-voted without comment, is there any doubt this is a thrust to shut down substantial discussion of NN?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty much the fact that regardless of if you support net neutrality or not censorship of the internet will still continue to advance until the &quot;free&quot; internet becomes the same as in China.

    <div class="md"><p>See you are falling in the divide and conquer trap here.  You make a vague reference to genuine arguments against NN (which I&#39;m sure exist, don&#39;t get me wrong), without discussing them.

This is not how we will get to the bottom of things, but it makes us easily exploitable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I have participated in a few discussions about NN that were substantial... I don&#39;t see what this proves though.  You&#39;ve already tacitly admitted that what you said was a misdirection from substantial discussion of NN when you tried to point at other times you have made valuable contributions.  I told you exactly why I thought what you were saying amounts to effecting a divide and conquer attack on behalf of the telecomm cartel and nothing more, and I never said that &#39;taking a position&#39; is divide and conquer.  So you are going to have to elaborate on that point because it seems to be mostly meaningless.  This is why your post comes across as empty and vague, defensive, and accusatory to me.</p>

<p>It looks more and more like you were tricked by a divide and conquer psy op, and you consider me as &#39;the other&#39;.  You see where I&#39;m coming from with this?  I&#39;m not trying to discredit your entire &#39;side&#39; based off your actions here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read your article but I wish you would just say whats on YOUR mind because I don&#39;t know what part of it to respond to?  In general, the whole article is largely speculative about vague language in the NN rules (and the author&#39;s own misunderstanding of information technology).  Once again, there is no concrete problem about NN that is illuminated -- the author just points out that power can be abused.  This isn&#39;t a problem with NN, it&#39;s a problem with power.  Anyone single entity with control over the telecom infrastructure could abuse this power.  It&#39;s irrelevant to the NN discussion, which is about if the government (which at least affords a small amount of democratic control) should let the telecom cartel have unchecked and unaccountable power to do whatever they want with the internet.</p>

<p>I really wish you would just say why you want to get rid of NN instead of playing these unconvincing games!</p>

It is becoming more clear that your consideration of this matter amounts to consuming talking points from your business masters -- that would explain why your best argument is a link to a forbes article.

    <div class="md"><p>This issue has been the subject of such constant and pervasive propaganda it is impossible to have an actual conversation about it.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t with investment in the internet, which has admittedly gone down since title II rules went into effect. It isn&#39;t with the people supporting it, though that should give you a clue it isn&#39;t what it seems to be.</p>

<p><strong>The problem is the FCC taking control and deciding what content can and cannot be allowed legally through the network.</strong></p>

<p>The rules the FCC published in 2015 use the phrases &quot;legal content&quot; and &quot;illegal content&quot;. They do not define these phrases. We are entering a time when the FCC could potentially declare certain content illegal and the ISPs will have to block it or face fines. Do we really want the FCC, the nipple police, deciding what is okay for our internet? </p>

<p>I would like a free and open internet, with no government or company regulating content. If the rules were changed to eliminate the troubling language of &quot;legal&quot; and &quot;illegal&quot; I would be happy.</p>

<p>As it stands, the current rules open the door for actual censorship of the net.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a lawyer, but to me the phrases &#39;legal content&#39; and &#39;illegal content&#39; do not require additional definition... US and state law defines what is legal and what is illegal... something which is illegal should be well defined by the set of codified laws lawmakers have established.  I&#39;m not sure why you think the FCC creates laws.  The lawmaking process is pretty complicated but basically democratically elected representatives like the people in congress and the president determine what the law is.  The FCC does not just create laws by fiat.  Am I understanding you right?  What is the actual trouble you have with that language?  Also can you post a link to the rules you are referring to for the sake of transparency?</p>

<p>In my view that language is the FCC saying that ultimately content which is viewable on the internet will be determined via the democratic process -- by democratically elected representatives (in theory lol).  Without net neutrality unaccountable private conglomerates will determine what they will transmit to you over the network, for a nominal fee of course.  I&#39;m not saying democratic regulation is perfect but it seems better than the non-net neutrality option, which is that a rich businessman decides what you can view.</p>

<p>The FCC has been given the broad authority to determine what is allowed or not allowed on broadcast networks that they oversee.

<p>This will not change. We already know that Google and Facebook censor certain posts, same with Twitter. This is already happening and will in no way change based on net neutrality.</p>

<p>I would support true net neutrality as most people understand it. I want data to be prioritized only in emergencies, such as remote surgeries and things of that importance.</p>

<p>I absolutely do not support throttling of certain content and competitive monopolistic practices like that. If they removed the legal / illegal language in the rules I would support it.

<p>I wasn&#39;t thinking of these types of regulations as laws for some reason, but I see what you mean now and the FCC DOES create laws for all intents and purposes.</p>

<p>The FCC regulations about &#39;decency&#39; and that sort of thing explicitly only apply to radio and TV.  The supreme court ruling which justified these regulations was based off the notion that the number of frequencies available to transmit across is inherently scarce using this technology.  There is no reason to think this type of censorship would (or even would be legally permitted to) transfer over to internet regulation. </p>

<p>Yes yes I agree, but not all of the information transmitted over the internet is speech.  I shouldn&#39;t have said &quot;content which is viewable&quot; since this explicitly brings to mind people speaking and communicating on the internet.  I meant internet traffic at large.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This will not change. We already know that Google and Facebook censor certain posts, same with Twitter. This is already happening and will in no way change based on net neutrality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I found much of what you said to be reasonable, and I appreciate your considered views on the FCC, and actually I agree with you now that it would be desirable for the FCC and its rules to be reformed in a way that explicitly protects speech and removes any vague language, I think this is a very low quality argument.  First of all, those services are not ISPs and this controversy isn&#39;t even about them (okay there is google fiber but you know what I mean).  Second of all, the control afforded to facebook and google is TINY compared to what an ISP could control, and the only way those websites can have any impact on speech and censorship and so on is if you use them, and you absolutely don&#39;t have to use them.  The ISP conglomerates are huge and form a cartel, and no one can compete with them.  Furthermore they control the infrastructure that transmits ALL internet traffic.  An ISP can literally block out a site, and limit your access to the internet in every definable way.</p>

<p>It is a HUGE change for ISPs (not just companies that run web sites -- we are talking about the companies which actually control the telecom infrastructure) to control our access in this way.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for your post.  Ultimately I agree with you that the most desirable thing would be for the FCC and its rules to be reformed to reflect a commitment to free speech and free access.  But ending net neutrality altogether would simply throw away any chance at having the free internet we desire.</p>

<p>While the idea that all bits will be treated equally is a nice idea, it is unrealistic. I would not want my Netflix traffic to be prioritized the same as remote surgery. Suggestion to that is obviously moronic.

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is that the net neutrality regulations are possibly going to be REPEALED, not that there are new regulations being proposed?</p>

<p>I agree with your sentiment about remote surgery internet traffic being prioritized over netflix traffic. The FCC and the net neutrality rules do not prohibit that from happening -- they do not prohibit prioritization and discrimination of internet traffic ALTOGETHER, only when it is &#39;unjust&#39; and &#39;against the public interest&#39;.  Yes the language is vague, and your point on that is well taken, but the point is that it does not shut out the possibility and we can only speculate about that potential bad outcome you are worrying about.  And to be honest, I think that outcome is quite unlikely -- I don&#39;t think the FCC would have a problem with prioritizing remote surgery traffic over netflix traffic, they have no reason to stop such a policy and they would rightly face great public backlash over such interference.</p>

<p>You know who does though?  The ISPS who already take tons of money from netflix in exchange for specialized treatment, including special access to ISP facilities in order to optimize delivery times.  Netflix actually has servers at tons of ISP facilities specifically for short circuiting content delivery, and the telecoms take big money to allow for that.  Netflix could easily pay their way into getting their traffic prioritized over remote surgery traffic, and there would be little the public could do about it, especially if the net neutrality regulations are repealed.</p>

<p>We have a small degree of democratic control over the government.  The massive telecom conglomerates who literally control the nation&#39;s IT infrastructure, do not operate in the name of the public interest -- they operate to maximize their profits, and we have absolutely no control over them.  If we remove the few remaining regulations which protect net neutrality, they will only grow in power.</p>

<p>How did you go from &quot;Also, allowable speech should absolutely not be determined by a democratic process or any process.&quot; to saying that censorship by an undemocratic profit motivated board of corporate oligarchs is preferable to censorship by a democratic institution?</p>

<p>This is the opening of the new rules the FCC has published. There&#39;s a lot of bullshit buzzwords like &quot;light-touch&quot; etc. It appears to be a replacement of the rules from 2015 based on Title II. The new rules don&#39;t specifically mention legal/illegal content, but I remain unconvinced it is a positive change.</p>

<p>In my opinion the best scenario would be Title II applied to access only, with content entirely unregulated. People should be allowed to express any view, post any art, publish any video, etc online without censorship or access problems. The only thing punishable online should be crimes that take place in the real world, like CP, theft, etc. Private companies like Facebook and Google should not be held accountable for what is posted on their sites any more than libraries are held accountable for the books they contain.</p>

<p>In other words, &quot;censorship by private companies (an undemocratic profit motivated board of corporate oligarchs) is preferable to censorship by the government (an institution which allows for at least a small degree of democratic control)&quot;.  I guess I should have said that this is what should be concluded from what you were saying, instead of making it seem like what that is what you have in mind when you made your original comment.</p>

<p>I am reading the summary of that document.  And it seems as though indeed, the net neutrality rules (the title II rules) are merely being REPEALED.  It seems the only regulations which are being PROPOSED are some unrelated regulations requiring which will require ISPs to be &#39;transparent&#39;.  Do you agree?</p>

<p>I agree again with your sentiment about a free and open internet.  I&#39;m not sure what you have in mind with title II regulations only applying to access, while content is unregulated.  The title II regulations state this -- they say the FCC is allowed to keep the telecom conglomerates from limiting <em>access</em> in a way that discriminates about <em>content</em>.  Perhaps the most applicable regulation states that the ISPs can&#39;t, &quot;make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services&quot;.  So this is saying what you want, isn&#39;t it?  It is saying access the ISPs grant can&#39;t discriminate about the content in an unjust way.  There is nothing in title ii that regulates content specifically (to my knowledge).  Furthermore the title ii regulations apply to ISPs, not companies like google or facebook (to my knowledge)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From this comment it does sound like we have an understanding. I appreciate the protections title II apply to ISPs. The part of the 2015 rules that I have a problem with is the language that an FCC lawyer could twist into allowing them to regulate content. If they made it very clear that content would not be allowed to be blocked that would be fine. If they simply removed the words legal and illegal from the 2015 rules I don&#39;t think there would be an issue. But as it stands, those words open up the opportunity for the federal government to decide what can appear online. The FCC has a history of trying to regulate anything they believe they have authority over. I don&#39;t see evidence that they are protecting the internet, and their past actions show they are willing to over-reach. These rules that currently only apply to TV and radio could very easily begin to apply to the internet. If they do not intend for that to happen, they need to very clearly state that in the regulations.</p>

<p>Given the recent controversies with torrents, WikiLeaks, and attacking expression in general, I am very concerned with future administrations blocking access to certain content. They have already shown they are interested in doing this but had not the means to do it previously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we understand each other but I don&#39;t think we fully agree yet.  </p>

<p>First, I suppose it is possible an FCC lawyer could twist the imprecise language in title ii in an attempt to regulate content, and though that would be quite a twist (more like an outright fabrication), I agree now there should be extremely precise language which prohibits the FCC from restricting access to content (let the FBI and police deal with &#39;illegal&#39; content like child porn and so on).  I&#39;m not sure if that change is as simple as getting rid of references to the legal vs illegal distinction you have a problem with but ultimately I think you&#39;re right and that should be done.</p>

<p>I agree that the FCC has overreached before in its regulation of TV and radio.   But the reason why they were able to get away with that regulation, is because the supreme court upheld the legality of that censorship (wrong in my view), stating that it was only legal because the inherent scarcity of radio frequencies meant that we needed to have a regulatory body managing what is being transmitted over that limited number of frequencies.  But this does NOT apply to the technology which is used to bring us the internet.  Neither the motivating factors nor the legal justification for the FCCs past censorship of TV and Radio indicate that that censorship could spread to the internet -- and title ii itself has nothing to do with that.  If that censorship were to come about, it would be something entirely new (and we should oppose it if it ever comes up, just like we should repeal the still existing censorship of tv and radio).</p>

<p>There is no legal precedent for this type of censorship you fear getting applied to the internet, and the previous justification for the legality of the censoring of TV and radio could not be applied to the internet.  And though we should remain vigilant and fight the government if they ever DO try to do something NEW to censor the internet, repealing NN will not weaken their ability to ever enact this new type of censorship because it does not give the FCC any say whatsoever in what content is available on the internet -- all NN does is let the FCC protect the public interest from ISP censorship.</p>

<p>For example, your concern about powerful people limiting access to things like wikileaks and torrents, is legitimate.  And if the government ever did that, they would do it by forcing the telecoms to do it with some kind of newly created legal infrastructure which lets them censor the internet.  And since the government is an institution we have a degree of democratic control over and internet censorship is wildly unpopular, we will be well positioned to stop them and fight that.  Now, consider this.  In 2005 comcast users began to allege that comcast was disrupting their connections to peer to peer file sharing networks (dropped connections or throttled connections).  Not just bittorrent, but others as well.  And the electronic frontier foundation investigated that, and found it to be true:  <strong>comcast was literally blocking and undermining access to peer to peer file sharing networks IN SECRET -- exactly what you feared!</strong>.  You know why they stopped?  Title ii -- net neutrality!  I agree with you that the current laws and regulations are not perfect for a free internet, and we should have stronger legislation guaranteeing a free internet.  But that doesn&#39;t mean we should scrap what we have now, especially when scrapping NN will lead directly to the exact things we want to avoid.</p>

<p>Why would <a href="http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/on-the-internet-day-of-action-comcast-supports-net-neutrality">Comcast support NN</a> and why is the <a href="http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/on-the-internet-day-of-action-comcast-supports-net-neutrality">front page of reddit</a> lying about it? </p>

<p>The manipulation is on purpose. The ISPs in favor of NN are in bed with politicians.  They want innovation of the internet to slow down so they can milk this money train a little longer.  They want people to believe that the internet will always work through a infrastructure grid that requires regulation, and the only fair way to divvy up the areas of internet service is to have the government do it. So they scare people into believing that the only ISPs that will ever exist are the major corporations (Verizon, Comcast etc.), but it&#39;s not true.  <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/googles-magic-internet-balloons-bringing-wi-fi-to-india/">Google has had success with their ballons</a> and that&#39;s the real future.  This idea that areas will have to use only one internet provider because of infrastructure limitations and that they&#39;ll throttle the internet and jack up prices is a scare tactic.  The reason ISPs want NN is because they know the government will work in their interest to ensure a market and it will restrict innovation and therefore eliminate competition.  </p>

<p>No FCC intervention means the free market will be allowed to run in a way that no one can predict.  It will allow a guy like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/kim-dotcom-is-rambling-about-starting-his-own-internet-1686159521">Kim Dotcom to start his own ISP</a>, which may or may not be worth it, but at least there&#39;s no FCC there to tell him &quot;No you can&#39;t be a provider in this area it&#39;s been designated to Verizon&quot; for example. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read Comcast&#39;s statement -- they do not support net neutrality, they are just saying they do.  They explicitly say they are opposed to the actual regulatory instruments which have been maintaining net neutrality, while also giving lip service to the idea of net neutrality -- its just marketing, and you fell for it.  The FCC regulations which telecom conglomerates want repealed, AKA net neutrality, include things like allowing the FCC to promote competition in local markets, and to keep the providers from having services and making charges which lead to discrimination about the types of content that is provided, among other things -- and this is all done in support of their stated aim of protecting the public interest, and they are reporting to our democratic institutions, so we have some degree of control over what they can and will do.</p>

<p>Your fantasy about the FCC saying &quot;No you can&#39;t be a provider in this area it&#39;s been designated to Verizon&quot; has nothing to do with what the FCC is capable of doing or what they have been doing with the net neutrality regulations which are in effect and enjoy wide popular support.  You are describing the type of monopolized market that the telecom cartel is fighting for -- and what they largely already have.  You are misleading people. </p>

<p>The telecom market is not a free market, with or without FCC regulations.  I don&#39;t think any serious economist would describe it as such.  You sound like a con man.</p>

<p>...how is the telecom market not a free market?  There&#39;s no supply and demand for internet? Are you one of those people who believe the internet is a utility like water electricity or gas? </p>

<p>As it is the internet is setup via &quot;the grid&quot;, &quot;internet lines&quot; follow along the same lines as phone lines, but it won&#39;t be like that in the future. The same way you can watch youtube videos on your phone through a satellite provider, entire homes will get internet in the same way. This will allow ISPs to provide internet without using &quot;the grid&quot; at all, which will be much cheaper for them.  Which means giant companies like Verizon, who have huge amounts of capital, will have smaller companies that will be in competition with them.  The problem that a company like Verizon faces is that processing speeds are getting faster and soon people won&#39;t see the advantage of getting faster wired connections if people can still watch Netflix through a wireless provider. </p>

<p>15 years from now you&#39;ll realize I was right. </p>

<p>Lol, the existence of supply and demand are not the only requirements for the existence of a <strong>free</strong> market.  A market must meet tons of requirements to be regarded as free, to the point where some economists would tell you that a &#39;free market&#39; exists only in theory.  You literally did not know the first thing about what a free market was when you said that, so please be more careful with your words.  </p>

<p>Its not clear at all why non &#39;grid&#39; technologies will bring smaller companies in competition with the telecom cartel, when you even admit that that cartel has more capital it can use to destroy a smaller company in terms of infrastructure, advertising, legal wheeling and dealing, and increase its own efficiency to lower prices.  Even if a small company secured a patent on some marvelous new technology for a distributed wireless internet, the principles behind that technology will easily be reverse engineered and reformulated to skirt around the patent (the vast legal resources and power wielded by the cartel will help with that too). </p>

<p>Its also not clear why you think increased processor speeds will push people away from wired connections.  Wireless transmission is not bottlenecked by signal processing, it is bottlenecked by interference and signal strength, these problems will only get worse if even more traffic is being routed over radio networks.  And more robust signal processing techniques can only do so much to optimize transmissions over an inherently scarce radio spectrum that needs to accommodate more and more throughput. </p>

<p>I think you are wrong with your predictions and you don&#39;t understand the technology we&#39;re talking about, like you didn&#39;t understand what a free market is.  Its certainly plausible that someday end users will be accessing the internet from their homes wirelessly, but I don&#39;t see a future where the infrastructure of the internet (already a hodgepodge of different technologies) ever goes fully wireless, or how a wireless technology could skirt around the ISPs but still access the internet while remaining off the grid.  I don&#39;t think you understand the complexity of this system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, you don&#39;t think I understand what a free market is, guy who thinks that a market dominated by a monopoly is a free market?  I guess will have to spend more time in the economics department lol</p>

<p>Lmfao, sure I know the difference.  Radio waves are a kind of electromagnetic radiation and 5g is a non-existent communication standard.  Lmao, there is no 5g standard currently in existence you clumsy fool.  That being said I would be quite surprised to learn of a proposed 5g standard which didn&#39;t use radio waves!</p>

<p>And no I don&#39;t know what the fuck you are talking about when you say that higher processing speeds will improve the internet, because I know that the bottleneck in networked computing is the networking technology and IO operations over network infrastructure and that processor speeds are more than sufficient to handle all of the signal processing and scheduling problems relevant to high speed networked computing.</p>

<p>Not even defended your ideas here... remember when I said you sound like a con man?  Look! You were a con man who had no idea what they were talking about!</p>

<p>US and state law defines what is legal and what is illegal... something which is illegal should be well defined by the set of codified laws lawmakers have established.  I&#39;m not sure why you think the FCC creates laws.  The lawmaking process is pretty complicated but basically democratically elected representatives like the people in congress and the president determine what the law is.  The FCC does not just create laws by fiat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FCC has been given the broad authority to determine what is allowed or not allowed on broadcast networks that they oversee. They absolutely create law, they have been given this authority by Congress. Contrary to popular belief, many laws are created by committee instead of by the established legislative process. This is why the FDA can determine what we are allowed to eat without having to approve every chemical through Congress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also can you post a link to the rules you are referring to for the sake of transparency?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The terms are used in the FCC release which is posted on their website, in April 2015. It is a .docx file.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my view that language is the FCC saying that ultimately content which is viewable on the internet will be determined via the democratic process -- by democratically elected representatives (in theory lol).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has already been shown that the FCC has the authority to fine and punish networks that show content they deem inappropriate. Look up Nipplegate. This would extend their content regulatory reach to the internet.</p>

<p>Also, allowable speech should absolutely not be determined by a democratic process or any process. Speech is protected, all speech is legal, no matter your opinion (other than verifiable threats etc). Freedom of speech should be global and the internet is currently the best example of that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without net neutrality unaccountable private conglomerates will determine what they will transmit to you over the network, for a nominal fee of course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will not change. We already know that Google and Facebook censor certain posts, same with Twitter. This is already happening and will in no way change based on net neutrality.</p>

<p>I would support true net neutrality as most people understand it. I want data to be prioritized only in emergencies, such as remote surgeries and things of that importance.</p>

<p>I absolutely do not support throttling of certain content and competitive monopolistic practices like that. If they removed the legal / illegal language in the rules I would support it. But every version of these rules has included language like this. It is clear what the intention is, censorship.</p>
