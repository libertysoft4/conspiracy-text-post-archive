        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So the people telling you it&#39;s not deliberate, or an AI algorithm splicing together different videos are full of shit. I don&#39;t know if the games have been removed (probably not), but many involved objectives such as performing a C section on a pregnant Elsa. I saw my daughter (then 4) playing it. She also found a ton of similar games on a website called <a href="http://www.mafa.com">http://www.mafa.com</a>, which can also be found by googling &quot;girl games&quot;.</p>

<p>This network is way more extensive than most realize, so don&#39;t let people distract you with their bullshit theories.</p>

<p>Edit: another reason I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s &quot;random&quot;, is how often &quot;finger family song&quot; is associated with these videos. Listen to the lyrics to the song, it reads exactly like something an adult would recite to a child to groom them for molestation.</p>

<p>&quot;Mommy finger mommy finger where are you? Here I am here I am how do you do?&quot;</p>

<p>That BS nursery rhyme that didn&#39;t exist before YouTube sounds like it&#39;s entirely based around making a song to make molestation seem &quot;playful&quot;. And all these videos are associated with this stupid ass rhyme.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was more naive back then (she is about to be 8), but the moment I saw the game I banned then games and website immediately. I&#39;m sorry I thought her googling &quot;girl games&quot; with my supervision was OK.</p>

<p>My kids have been banned from YouTube without supervision for the last year, specifically because of &quot;Elsagate&quot;. I&#39;ve also warned a ton of parents to not trust their kids on YouTube. I also sat down with my kids and explained to them all why the videos were twisted and why they can&#39;t watch them. I sat down and explained to my daughter that the content creators have very Ill intent and I&#39;d gather she is now more educated on the subject of brainwashing and conditioning than most kids her age.</p>

<p>So if you want to come in here with your dismissive attitude and make me sound like a negligent parent, just know I sleep easy at night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it sounds to me like a scapegoat for bad parenting. if they kids can understand what is going on in the videos, it should still fall on the guardians of the child to provide good morals and life lessons. Block domains if you have to, but the internet is an amazing tool for all kinds of knowledge. obviously you are free to have your own opinion here, we can agree to disagree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really strongly of the opinion that children should not be allowed on the internet. Give them a CD with wikipedia and tell them to create their own small local networks (e.g. a school or library network) if you really want to teach them tech, but open access to the public internet should be restricted to people above the age of consent.</p>

<p>I like the idea of unschooling. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>unschooling children scored significantly below structured homeschoolers but within statistical variation of traditionally schooled children on standardized academic achievement tests</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea of a standardized achievement test for each unique human is pretty fucked up, but unschooling doesn&#39;t seem to be worse than a public education. It&#39;s basically a scientific control group for comparing education systems: not teaching kids at all is statistically the same as sending them to public school (when it comes to standardized testing), homeschooling helps kids pass standardized achievement tests.</p>

<p>Really though let&#39;s be honest. All it sort of DOES require though is a GOOD hearted company as large or tech savvy as Google to make some sort heavily filtered internet portal device.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you think instilled morals and ethics wouldnt help? That there was absolutely NOTHING they could do? And that because im in my 30s that i dont understand? Thats just kind of denial on how raising a kid can be. 8t is hectic and nobdoy really knows what theyre doing, and it gets weird over time. And yes it used to be that we could disappear all day and parents wouldnt have a clue where wed been. But really nothing they could do? Because ive seen tons of examples of people whos parents did raise them in adverse situations well. As well as ones who didnt. But theres no way NOTHING could have been done.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>YouTube, Google Play, and the Apple Store don&#39;t have effective quality control mechanisms in place when it comes to regulating &quot;appropriate content&quot; for children.</p>

<p>The problem is that you have to severely restrict user-generated content, hire massive amounts of manpower to audit it all, and then figure out a way to enforce arbitrary but culturally sensitive rules across the board.</p>

<p>Or you can rely on parents not to let their kids watch and purchase whatever the hell they want until they&#39;re old enough.</p>

<p>The bigger issue then, of course, is that parents today are almost unable to constantly govern their children without losing their sanity, and phones and tablets are the babysitter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mentioned this before. Some are even titled &quot;Elsa games&quot; and are Flash-based and older than than most of the freakier videos. Some of this started out as a dig at Disney and also poking fun at the annoyingly generic and boring &quot;girl games&quot; that were around at the time. But they were intended more as a satire thing than something for kids. Some were actually entertaining even while being oddball, like the Dermatology game (to get a better score you had to follow stuff that was in-line with real procedures - cleaning tools and dressing an area before surgery and doing sutures afterwards, r/popping probably would have liked it. Gross out - yes, but no dark implications.) and another one which was a clone of Drug Warz, but with the usual cartoon characters and references to older Breaking Bad tropes. Some of that was on New Grounds or Deviantart, before those kinds of things started taking off on their own. The internet is often weird like that.</p>

<p>Yet like you say a lot of it is worse and crap, as this thing has grown into something else over time. It&#39;s gone from being a poke at boilerplate stuff being mass produced and a lame genre using pop characters and being something even more twisted.</p>

<p>But part of the problem is that many parents are awful at being responsible and monitoring where their kids go online. They&#39;re still under the assumption that looking up things associated with pop-culture characters is always going to be kid-safe and that&#39;s no longer the case. If you&#39;re worried about that kind of thing you should always pre-screen and allow/deny on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if much is a bit of bored people with too much free time and making backlash type stuff in response to the kinds of games or software they make during their day-job. Cranking out some kind of gem-blaster clone with a different skin on it, probably going to want to do something crazy when there&#39;s no real creative freedom to it. If you don&#39;t mind the cringe, r/indianpeoplefacebook might give a kind of insight into the mentality of what&#39;s going on there.</p>
