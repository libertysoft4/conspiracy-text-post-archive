People of that elite status would just have their lawyers discretely arrange their self-surrender in a manner of which would be kept tightly sealed and off the media&#39;s radar and barely set foot in a police department if at all. They live above the law and receive police privileges not known to us normies.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;A few possibilities...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s examine this list first:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;Everything is a PSYOP? CIA runs NK?
</code></pre>

<p>Negative. North Korea &#39;NK&#39; is a &#39;rouge state&#39; by nature of its economics, and not so much its politics. It is not run by &#39;Kim&#39;, so much as it is operated by a cabal of military generals who knew Kim&#39;s father, and the financing access they have to China and Russia. the money flows from China and Russia, for black-ops and illicit finance. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump was chosen? Election wasn&#39;t real? Is that really surprising. Q seems Pro-Trump which only points to alt-right trolling via larping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was certainly not &#39;chosen&#39;. He was sworn in by merit of electoral college structure. This was not a populist win, which would be a &#39;media&#39; driven information program leading to popular-vote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re living in the matrix controlled by some celestially connected beings in an alternative universe? VOTL stuff</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? NO.</p>

<p>The holographic universe theory is in relation to information storage and low-energy elicitation, and not the structural nature of the universe. This is not the matrix, unless the way you think is the matrix, because our understanding of &#39;physics&#39; is fundamentally narrow-minded. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>UFO&#39;s/aliens happen to be real?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. This is true. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time travel? Where&#39;s McFly these days...keep in mind...Biff was based off Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Time travel is not possible. Yet, Seeing through time is possible. This is due to the nature of photon-states and residual forms of radiation imprinting upon an aspect of metrical &#39;space-time&#39;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is a PSYOP?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;PsyOp&quot;, stands for &#39;Psychological Operation&#39;, and is in relation to behaviorism, it&#39;s applications in geopolitical and economic missions, and operational/tactical evaluation/priming/learning/&#39;reinforcing&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What is the main implication&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It shows how wantonly foolish some people are, and how determined and willing others are to play with codes for fun. I was drinking on a long-night when I played. I also watched the news and reply to see how easily people were ping and primed - myself included in the degree of complexity of some of these puzzles - in that we all want to know the truth.</p>

<p>WE are constantly promised truth. When we see it, then we will know. Until then, the implications are, &quot;we are constantly offered truth for our faith&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will say this,</p>

<p>Every Great leader {some &#39;super-man&#39;}, is the &#39;mellenialistic-philosophy&#39; creation of someone else.</p>

<p>This does not mean he is not in league with people. Yet, it does also not mean he is part of a grand-conspiracy to overthrow a system that is already being shown as a grand-conspiracy to propagandize the nation into voting one way.</p>

<p>The fact Hillary wrote a book showing her faults in electoral strategy.</p>

<p>Trump use technology not regulated by the MSM to reach people who statistically now get their media from social outlets [friends] and have always psychologically trusted [peers] over news in all studies related to the subject.</p>

<p>The fact trump also promised everything to everyone, geographically, affected the perception of everyone in some unique way, to corner their particular &#39;buying-strategy&#39;. Their &#39;hot-button&#39; issue.</p>

<p>Now, your context: Imagine having all the information available to examine &#39;how&#39; something can happen, but assuming its some other applicable genius pulling your strings.  .  . Occam&#39;s Razor is how conspiracy theories gain validity and through deduction and evidence, proof.</p>

<p>Not faith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well put, yet the fallacy is in actually called &#39;Argument from ignorance&#39; [1], and I see this as more of a &#39;Base rate fallacy&#39;[2].</p>

<p>[1]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance</a></p>

<p>[2]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy</a></p>

<p>In this regard, your conclusion is not correct, in matter of determining truth probability. Yet, this does not mean your assessment is not theoretically necessary to assume. </p>

<p>In that assumption, you have an attitude - some philosophy - yet no more mathematically produced processes in models, you actually have no answers to the material structure of the relative universe. </p>

<p>So, yes, our understanding is &#39;so flawed&#39;, as we continually expect the possibility of traveling at/beyond light speed, without consideration to the physiology and capacity of mechanical environment to protect [that life form] from destruction - ASPECTS of science and models we do have a greater understanding of, as we have greater access to observation and experimentation to know this.</p>

<p>The means to travel worlds is not in speeds. The only aspect that will come of great-engines is in point-defense and interceptors. Everything else is inefficient in tran-system travel [where interacting with greater causes interrupts primitive colonization at every case]. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was no lone Trump ego show blundering himself into the WH as much as that&#39;s what the establishment wanted the public to believe.</p>

<p>Trump was surely chosen by some group. Otherwise he wouldn&#39;t have made it against all public odds. How can anybody even still consider the opposite?</p>

<p>he had to only spend 1/4 of the funds a DNC runner or fellow Republican candidate had to.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>He owns planes and hotels everywhere.</p>

<p>His stages were in his own places, or in demand and long-term deal with the rented space.</p>

<p>He never had to pay for more than gas on his flights.</p>

<p>His foundation was in real-estate empire and all the associative privileges and demanded capital that go with such. </p>

<p>Clinton had to form a phony foundation to get funding from foreign nations.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not as genius a political momentum as you might think. It&#39;s a good foundation of probable momentum. </p>

<p>This is not even addressing technology and how he reached people of various geographical places by hitting on every hot-button issue in promise.</p>

<p>Someone dangles a bunch of cryptic messages in front of you and you hungrily swallow it down and spend the next week of your life researching it. Are you seriously that easy to manipulate? You know who psyops work the best on? People who are that impressionable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q clearance is essentially the same as a TS (both considered a T5). The difference being is that Q&#39;s are processed via DOE, whereas TS is processed through DSS.</p>

<p>A Q clearance in general has greater access that <em>may</em> include SNM, etc. But if you are looking to have &quot;codes&quot; then they would be under a TS/SCI or SAP (DoD), not a Department of Energy clearance.</p>

<p>Source: Maintain a dual TS (DoD) &amp; Q; process clearances; oversee security management</p>
