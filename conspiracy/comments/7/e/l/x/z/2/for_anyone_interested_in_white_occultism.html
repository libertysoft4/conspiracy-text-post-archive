    <div class="md"><p>Jesus is the Son of God. He is not an idea. He came to humanity <em>to die</em> for the sins of ppl bec we could not help ourselves. He is the author of salvation to all who believe what He testified about the Father and Himself. </p>

<p>As Jesus said to Peter, when he uttered words of error, “Get behind me, Satan!”  </p>

<p>That is not hate.  It is truth —to turn you from error and delusion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He showed us the path of salvation, he didn&#39;t pay for it. He taught us that by learning his message, we can be like him and even do greater works than him. His message was that we are all children of God, and when we understand exactly what that means, he&#39;ll do wonders for us. Because we come to the realization that there is no separation between us and him. The father and I are one. You and I are one. The Lord and Jesus live in our hearts. He didn&#39;t pay our debt. Debt to who? Why would debt require a blood sacrifice? That type of Christianity doesn&#39;t encourage growth, compassion, or challenge in my opinion. Once you realize that God is all there ever has and ever will be, and that you are an inseperable part of him, then yes Jesus was a person that lived, but he is also an eternal soul that will always be there for you. But he is no more a son of God than you and I. Come to realize this, you&#39;ll be worthy of not just salvation, but a closer walk with our Lord. This was the point I was trying to make, but I&#39;m looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it. </p>

and the Word was God. 
2He was with God in the beginning. 
3Through him all things were made;

4In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 
5The light shines in the darkness,

<p>10He was in the world,

the world did not recognize him. 
11He came to that which was his own, 
but his own did not receive him. 
12Yet to <em>all who did receive him, 
to those who believed in his name,</em> 
he gave the right to become children of God— 
13children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.</p>

<p>14The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the <em>one and only Son,</em> who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow I was just looking into White Occultism, or more of good magic in general.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m working on creating &quot;holy magic&quot; spells, none of that death magic shit. Spells should incorporate beauty, passion, vigor, depth, peace, insight, and creativity, and shred those dedicated to evil.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem with Christian magic, it bolsters evil and gives them power. But we can bend it, like water-bending. It&#39;s hard to explain but if you channel joy into an evil remark, you can warp it. </p>

We exist physically in a third dimensional consciousness, above us is the astral plane, above that the causal plane, above that the mental plane, and above that the etheric plane. These are the &quot;negative&quot; planes. Think negative like the pole of a battery.  Above the mental plane you are in the realms of pure Spirit, beginning with the Soul plane.
