<p>The difference is one side tends to try and push the crazy ideologues to the sides (at times going overboard and silencing voices that need to be heard), and the other tends to amplify the crazy voices to build energy (at times going overboard and giving the crazy ideologues total control over their direction).</p>

<p>Also, it is a little rich for non-td assholesto hold forth on level-playing fields and censorship.  and oh btw.. the NN freakshow most certainly touches upon censorship.  the &quot;throttling websites, data and services&quot; <em>is</em> censorship.  Except, you&#39;re trying to portray it as if evil corporations will do it to the small fish.  otoh.. what we have right today right now is Google, FB, reddit, twitter and others running a downright fascist show of censoring opposing viewpoints.</p>
