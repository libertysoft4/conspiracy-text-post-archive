<p>I have never seen anyone on this subreddit say that. I do see a lot of pro-Trump and lock-Hillary-up posts though. I agree Hillary would have been a bad president, as is Trump, but for you to say we need to be more united, and then attack only one political party is very hypocritical.</p>

<p>The problem is not any individual person, the problem is the system. Any politician that fails to fight to revolutionize the system has failed their constituents. Every Republican or Democratic leaders I&#39;ve seen in my lifetime has just served to maintain the status quo. Bashing Trump or Hillary (like you just did) only further separates people and takes attention away from the real systematic issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both established parties and their dependence on insane amounts of cash to operate. The parties in and of themselves aren’t bad, but the system has morphed so that our representatives must hustle for that cash to get re-elected. The most cash comes from corporate lobbyists and that is who they represent. If raising money wasn’t an incentive they could focus harder on what the people want instead of repeatedly trying to destroy the internet as an example. So I’d say the enemy is an abstract one in that it is our system. So... fight the system? Rage against the machine? I don’t really know but Lawrence lessig talks about “root striking” which should be one of our main focuses I think. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So then who are the enemies?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>very simply, those people who support Greed and are prepared to conspire to benefit from other people&#39;s losses e.g. banks and most large business&#39; that use the &quot;it&#39;s for the shareholders/I was just following orders&quot; ... when I ripped them off/tricked them/scammed LIBOR!</p>

<p>FFS, it&#39;s basically the Neuremberg defense! </p>

<p>So &quot;who are the enemies&quot;?  We All are to some degree, becoz we &#39;sell ourselves&#39; to make the money we need to survive. It&#39;s a bit of a catch-22 there, but I don&#39;t include the people who aren&#39;t in a position to &quot;invest to make more&quot; in the group I consider &quot;the enemy&quot;</p>

<p>they are the people who are happy with the status quo and are doing their damndest to keep things the way they are -- as naivve as such thinking is, these people are the &#39;troops&#39; of the conservatives who like things just the way they are, well, the shareholders <em>do need</em> better returns ...</p>

<p>So yeah, IMO it&#39;s the people who have blinkers on, tend to not know better than to &quot;believe the official narrative&quot; <em>about whatever</em></p>

<p>these people &#39;prefer not to think&#39; ... so they let the MSM do the thinking for them. These people are the &quot;mindless enemy&quot; who support the Killarys of this world ... becoz they were gently sold to!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another problem is that most people here probably don&#39;t have the ability to make a change. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;change&quot; first occurs between the ears&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we are serious we need resources and a plan, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and the First thing we need to do is know how to &#39;recognize each other&#39;, like a logo or brandword</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but in reality we are just strangers in a subreddit and anonymity is a barrier because we know nothing about each others abilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think globlally, as you are, and &#39;act locally&#39; .. start doing this IRL in the world around you, start spreading this message IRL, &quot;let&#39;s ALL STOP FIGHTING EACH OTHER and start <em>working together</em> becoming friends ... <em>then</em> that develops into a unified group that has it&#39;s &#39;beginings online&#39; aka &quot;cyberspace&quot; which is nowhere and everywhere at the same time, so nobody &#39;owns&#39; this, like anonymous BUT REAL!</p>

<p>Now how do you do this? Social media&#39;s a good start BUT not everyone, esp the &quot;old hippies&quot; who are in their 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s and probably right behind ideas like this, are internet savvy BUT their knowledge is priceless and needs to become a part. How do we also touch such people? Through the grandkids social media? lol</p>
