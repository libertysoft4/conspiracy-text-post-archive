        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you go on r/all today you will see many posts from different subreddits displaying this same message:</p>

<p>Join the Battle for Net Neutrality! Net neutrality will die in a month and will affect [Insert] and many other websites and services, unless we fight for it!</p>

<p>These are some of the posts I&#39;ve seen: 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/7ehs8y/join_the_battle_for_net_neutrality_net_neutrality/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/7ehs8y/join_the_battle_for_net_neutrality_net_neutrality/</a>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/7efsi6/join_the_battle_for_net_neutrality_net_neutrality/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/7efsi6/join_the_battle_for_net_neutrality_net_neutrality/</a></p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t have strong opinions on the Net neutrality issue but I do try to investigate shilling, corporate manipulation, and astroturfing when I see it. Regardless of your position on this issue you have to realize that these posts are suspicious and that Reddit could be a prime target for Pro-Net Neutrality companies to spread their propaganda. Net Neutrality is a complicated issue that can confuse the uninformed citizen and this propaganda seems to immediately persuade them to view it as negative. Technical issues like this seem particularly vulnerable to shilling so watch out!</p>

<p>Only claim I have is in being aware that there are some, who have money, who have shown interest in keeping the Obama era stuff.</p>

<p>However, keep in mind that bankers started the whole funding of both sides in any conflict for maximum profit.</p>
