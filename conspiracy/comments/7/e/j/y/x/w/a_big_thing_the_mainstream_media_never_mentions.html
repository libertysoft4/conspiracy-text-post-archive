<p>30% of birth defects in the UK are from Pakistani immigrants (which represent 3% of the population)</p>

<p>This is a pretty big strike against that part of the world. Respecting culture that is different to your own is one thing -- treating a culture as equal when they are backwards and wrong is another.... even tribal cultures know not to inbreed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all like  to act like Muslims are a thousand leagues from us. I&#39;m irish (duh) and Christianity was once as powerful here as Islam is.. well anywhere Muslims are. People were subjugated by the shackles of religion. Not to say all Christians and all Muslims are good, but surely we should work towards liberating our fellows from those shackles instead of villanising them and calling them barbarians. 
Whether you want to admit it Islam is a beast the west created.  The Iran war killing thousands of families, drone strikes going on even now, IsIs made by America. And lets not forget what happened with Israel. Their extremism is caused by all of that. </p>

<p>No I am not &quot;oh all Muslims are good.&quot; But i thought the idea of this subreddit is that people were at least a little woke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying they are bad. Im saying they are inbreed and should be treated as such. Inbreed people have lower intelligence, and more aggression. They need to be taught the difference between right and wrong, whcih, in this case is entirely objective. Inbreeding causes massive birth defects and shallows the gene pool.</p>

<p>We should look at countries that have 70% inbreeding as contemptible, backwards and wrong. I believe in tolerance and freedom for different cultures -- not cultures which are harmful to themselves and others.</p>

<p>If a person is harmful to themselves, we stop them, not tolerate them.</p>

If you read the old testament and about the first humans and genesis in particular, you have to notice that they&#39;re all having children with their family. How did not half of them become retarded? (Same goes for the Quran i think, it&#39;s just that I&#39;ve done way more studying on the Bible than I have on Quran) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plus, even though I think all these religions are basically fairy tales, I still respect the Old Testament as a historical document that was attempting to preserve actual historical information which had been previously kept alive by an oral tradition. These stories are describing actual things that people believe they experienced. Now, their interpretation of events I might have an arguments with, but I do not doubt for a second that these events transpired in some manner consistent with the books. In that regard, I believe much of the genealogy is more accurate than anything else. Because keeping track of that was of the utmost concern to the authors and society from which it came.</p>

A BBC investigation in Britain several years ago revealed that at least 55% of the Pakistani community in Britain was married to a first cousin.  [<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Ban-UK-Pakistanis-from-marrying-cousins/articleshow/1298135.cms?">https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Ban-UK-Pakistanis-from-marrying-cousins/articleshow/1298135.cms?</a>]
The BBC’s research also discovered that while British Pakistanis accounted for just 3.4% of all births in Britain, they accounted for 30% of all British children with recessive disorders and a higher rate of infant mortality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;d have to see some stats about that 70% number in order for it to be believable. And 30% of ALL UK defects are from Pakistanis? That&#39;s pretty hard to swallow too.</p>

<p>Whatever practices they have in Pakistan, it&#39;s clearly working out OK for them up to this point and who are we to try and change cultures &quot;for their own good.&quot; That has traditionally not be very positive. There&#39;s a fine line between legitimate concern and eugenics.</p>

<p>But if it&#39;s actually as you say in the UK with immigrants, then I can understand the concern. I&#39;d think the public health system would be on top of it from a cost control perspective.</p>
