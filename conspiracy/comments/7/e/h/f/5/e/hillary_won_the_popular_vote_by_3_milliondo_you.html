<p>Cases of voter fraud</p>

<p>A woman in Iowa who voted twice. Terri Lynn Rote had the enormous misfortune of bad timing. Right as the candidate she supported, Trump, was drawing attention to fraud cases, Rote decided to try to vote twice in Des Moines, and got caught. The case made national headlines simply by virtue of the fact that it happened when it did, and that she voted for Trump.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, she suggested that the fault lay with Trump. “The polls are rigged,” she said to a local radio station by way of explaining her multiple votes, echoing another of Trump&#39;s complaints.</p>

<p>A man in Texas who voted twice. Phillip Cook was arrested on Election Day after voting twice. He claimed to be an employee of Trump&#39;s campaign who was testing the security of the electoral system. He wasn&#39;t an employee of the campaign — and the polling location&#39;s security worked perfectly well, it seems.</p>

<p>A woman who cast a ballot on behalf of her dead husband. Audrey Cook is a Republican election judge in Illinois. She and her husband applied for absentee ballots because he was ill. He died before completing his, so she filled it out for him and sent it in. The ballot will not be counted.</p>

<p>A woman in Florida who marked absentee ballots. Gladys Coego was hired to open absentee ballots in Miami-Dade County. One of her co-workers noticed that she was going a step further, filling in the bubble for a mayoral candidate with a pen she had in her purse. She was caught in the act and arrested. There&#39;s no evidence that she changed any presidential votes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the one hand, I think both sides engage in illegal voting voter fraud, with the US left having an edge of several million votes. That both sides are engaged is the insurance needed to keep any serious investigation from getting too far.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I know that a considerable number of votes are nullified every election, and that this likely constitutes the most serious form of voter fraud in the US, with illegally cast votes serving as a red herring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are they nullified?  In what state?
I&#39;m a poll worker and the only votes I&#39;ve seen nullified are those who can&#39;t show id.  They get a provisional ballot.  If the number of provisional ballots do not exceed the amount of difference between the two candidates, then they aren&#39;t researched.
They must be nullified past where I see them or perhaps other states handle things differently than we do.</p>
