    <div class="md"><p>I think my daughter nailed it- it&#39;s a way to make people feel complicit. It&#39;s sort of like the new version of feeling paranoid about your &quot;permanent record&quot;- the average parent likely has this smut on their phone and allowed their kid to access it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame parents very much- it has not been an easy row to keep my kids &quot;unplugged&quot;. It is a lot of work and I get why folks hand their kids their phone to keep them occupied. And kids are so easily addicted to this short-attention theater!! I took a video of my youngest making microwave popcorn and she replayed that thing until my phone battery died. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s one of the common shill arguments &quot;why do parents let their kids watch YT&quot;. Sure, kids shouldn&#39;t watch too much YouTube, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that these videos exist. Another retarded argument that many seem to fall for.</p>

<p>Regarding the second part of your post: this is why these Elsagate videos are so highly effective. Kids are hyper-stimulated, with a lot of color, movement and sound and this can keep them occupied for hours on end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I promise, I&#39;m not a shill. I&#39;m honestly trying to figure out how this phenomenon still exists. Why do YouTube and Disney allow it?? </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m old, lol. I have kids from 28 to 5 years old. My older kids didn&#39;t even get to see a Disney movie while growing up and my younger children are even more restricted when it comes to programming. They are only allowed an hour a day of screen time, and that is fully monitored by me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My daughter is the oddest duck sometimes, but I love how her mind works. I had actually called her way back summer before last to warn her about this elsagate deal. She, of course, thought I was nuts. A few days later, she caught my grandson watching Elsa vids- she told me (and I posted it here,) that what caught her attention was a change in &quot;tone&quot;, that the sound quality of what my grandson was watching changed. She went to check what he was watching and sure enough, elsagate. When she checked her history, she had hours of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you instantly assume it&#39;s shills? </p>

<p>It&#39;s very possible people do just have the opinion that it&#39;s a money grab. As you said yourself &#39;when the topic got big&#39; these opinions started showing up. In my mind that&#39;s because it&#39;s being seen by a an audience that&#39;s less acquainted with the conspiratorial angle. It could just be this subs second favourite boogeyman: the sheeple who can&#39;t see the forest for the trees. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be combative, I just see this shill argument thrown around so much here but I&#39;ve rarely seen any evidence. Certainly nothing that would imply this behaviour is as ubiquitous as often reported here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I read the post, and it makes a lot of sense. The issue I have with the people looking into it, is that the focus isn&#39;t on the comments, or I should say the criminals in the comments.</p>

<p>If people wanted to make a difference, they should report the accounts of any of the pervs hanging out in those videos, even if it&#39;s to Interpol, since we don&#39;t know their country of origin.</p>

<p>The videos are weird, but that person made a pretty high effort attempt to explain it. If there is a ring, I think it&#39;s in the comments. Either way, those people for sure need to be investigated, and I think it&#39;s weird people only focus on the videos themselves.</p>

<p>Basically, there&#39;s no easy fix, I&#39;ve read that more than 100 hours of content is uploaded per minute, or a year&#39;s worth of content per day. Do they pay thousands of people to basically watch videos? Do they remove anything that gets reported?</p>

<p>See, people here love to scream censorship, but then don&#39;t admit the issues with trying to actually go through so much content to censor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue there&#39;s far less videos that are getting reported for that, and YouTube&#39;s ability to recognize language means it can automatically be detected and dealt with. </p>

<p>The very fact most of these videos don&#39;t talk, and only make noises and strange sounds makes it that much harder to deal with. And they&#39;re long, and there&#39;s a shit ton of them.. what makes you think there&#39;s an easy solution?</p>

<p>Besides, they have to decide what needs to be censored, anything with a syringe? I mean, they have to have a reason they can justify removing it, they can&#39;t just say &quot;syringe+kids=bad&quot; and expect the content creator to swallow that.</p>

<p>Why, do you have some idea what they are supposed to do besides hire tons of people to go through the videos, or just remove shit tons of content without reviewing it, while more and more gets uploaded?</p>

<p>If I posted a video of someone getting beheaded (no sound or text) or someone showing their some nudity in the background - I&#39;m pretty sure it gets censored immediately.  </p>

<p>There is no excuse for this shit.  They thought through the scenario before making it.  They have a story and you buy it.  Well I don&#39;t because I could take the same approach and do a variety of different videos that are kid friendly.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This elsagate thing has been around for over a year and it is absolutely real. One of the producers did an AMA recently at r/elsagate, actually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The videos are creepy and disturbing. What is really mysterious is that Disney will issue you a takedown notice if you put a video of your Elsa-themed wedding etc, but allows these disgusting knockoffs to be fed, unsolicited, to children everywhere.</p>

<p>Why? I don&#39;t get it, honestly. My eldest child suggested that it is a way to make everyone complicit in perversion involving children- I mean, even the best parent that lets their kid watch YouTube likely has this shit in their browsing history. </p>

<p>The solution? Don&#39;t let your kids browse YouTube. Get them a coloring book or Legos or something. Even without the threat of them being fed disturbing fetish content, all that screen time is an unhealthy way to entertain children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s multipurposed and many layered. These Elsa videos, I mean. Its very calculated. </p>

<p>I think pretty much everything mentioned with them is correct. Child abuse, pedo shit, money from the ads, normalizing bad things to our kids, the list goes on and on. Just because one aspect is true, doesn&#39;t mean another isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s here to divide us further, into arguing what it&#39;s about, and to make America introduce reactionary rules. I see Elsa vids as an attack on the western world and western culture as a whole.  They know how to attack us now, it&#39;s not just about the action of what these videos do to our kids or culture, but how we over react to it and break ourselves in country and mind, in the process. </p>

<p>I did not call -gate because I feel that makes it sound like a crackpot conspiracy to normal people, and we should start picking our words very carefully, if to be taken seriously.</p>
