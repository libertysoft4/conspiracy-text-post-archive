<p>Trump has at least touched on Epstein before, but the Clintons have been silent.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the original C-SPAN video where Trump talks about Epstein. Go to approx 22:50 for his thoughts.</p>

<p>I think they negotiate what questions/topics are allowed or off topic ahead of the interviews. If the interviewer won&#39;t agree, they won&#39;t get the interview. Whenever Hillary was asked tough questions during the campaign, they would accept whatever spin or lie she said and not ask any follow up questions.</p>

If this story had stayed out in the open longer people would have had to ask about the actual content of the emails and Instagram. Now it is all but forgotten in the mainstream. Now when people hear #pizzagate it&#39;s automatically associated with right-wing Conspiracy theory and dismissed. I have discussions about it with people from time to time and they dismiss it. I ask them &quot;have you seen James Alefantis&#39;s Instagram?&quot; And they usually have no clue about him. They won on controlling that narrative. </p>

<p>One interesting point is that Epstein pleaded the fifth to the question &quot;Have you ever socialized with females under the age of 18 in attendance with Donald Trump&quot; He pleaded the fifth to the same question regarding Blowjob Bill too.</p>

<p>I wonder why you as a person don&#39;t think it is more interesting that reporters don&#39;t ask the sitting president about this or why he goes into changing rooms of minors.</p>

<p>So, you as a guy who appears to like tough questions, why are you not starting a thread and ask the guys here why the President is not asked about this stuff?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did. He implies the Clintons are involved with Epstein, which is a fair enough assumption but only throws in Trump, who is literally the President, in the comments as site note to protect against &quot;whataboutism&quot;. So I am left wondering why a truth-seeking person like OP is interested in this while his main focus is on a former president 15+ years out of office and his failed wife instead of the guy sitting in the oval office.</p>

<p>You have any idea why op doesn&#39;t ask the journalists why they don&#39;t ask Potus about his visits to the changing room of kids?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. You seem totally unimpressed by the president watching little girls change while your entire comment history is full talking about an ex-president having connections with a guy who also has connections with the guy who you are not concered about who is watched girls change. Isn&#39;t that weird...</p>

<p>Why are yot not asking more questions about the Potus. I try to understand he holds the most powerful office ( that we know of ) and is watching woman in the changing room. No reporters seem to ask him about this in the last time. Why are you making threads about this. When will you start investigate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that so? I checked his comments. He mentions Epstein very often and every time he also mentions Clinton, never Trump. </p>

<p>You sure about your comments? Seems pretty partisan and cuckish. OP wants to grill Clintons for their connections to Epstein but is not concerned with the Potus peeking into changing rooms. Hmmm. How can that be? He is a truth seeker and so are you, but all his Epstein comments in various threads are always talking about an ex president and his failed wife but never about the actual POTUS. Maybe, just maybe you cucks are sitting on your knees taking a big cock while getting narrative updates.</p>

<p>One simple questions. Why is op not making threads and asking why no report asked the Potus about watching girls change. Why buddy? You guys support that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the Clintons&#39; support staff isn&#39;t nearly as immune to facing the public as the Clintons.  People could also start yelling such questions at Chelsea.  That would probably be more likely to get B&amp;H angry enough to do something rash.  The more they try to suppress the story, the more obvious it gets and the more it seems like they&#39;re hiding something.  The Clintons are losing support of major players and have spun so many falsehoods to so many people its just a matter of time before the top of the food chain decides to stop enabling Billary.  </p>

<p>B&amp;C likely know alot of damaging secrets, but the more powerful Clinton associates almost certainly were savvy enough to start insulating themselves once Hillary lost.  Its also worth noting there&#39;s probably Clinton associates who could damage rivals more than themselves if the Clintons went down.  Alot of powerful people reassessed the Clintons&#39; value/ROI on election night.  </p>

<p>Virginia Roberts is the girl&#39;s name. She also said she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew. They are pictured together here:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/01/05/2465883300000578-0-Allegations_Prince_Andrew_pictured_with_Virginia_Roberts_and_Ghi-m-1_1420447321235.jpg">http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/01/05/2465883300000578-0-Allegations_Prince_Andrew_pictured_with_Virginia_Roberts_and_Ghi-m-1_1420447321235.jpg</a></p>

<p>In a 2011 interview with her attorneys, Virginia Roberts, one of the teenagers preyed upon by Epstein, said he had told her he had &quot;compromising&quot; information on Bill Clinton and that the former president &quot;owes me a favor.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton">https://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton</a></p>

<p>So that alone is proof Epstein has blackmail on Clinton.</p>

<p>According to a 2011 court filing by alleged Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre, she saw Clinton and Prince Andrew on the island but never saw the former president do anything improper. Giuffre has accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her when she was a minor, a charge Buckingham Palace denies.</p>

<p>Flying with a convicted pedophile on his jet nicknamed the Lolita Express is not proof of a crime, even doing it dozens of times like Bill Clinton did is not proof of a crime, but you&#39;d have to be a fool to think that&#39;s not the sort of thing that deserves a QUESTION.

    <div class="md"><p>The Clintons have deep connections to the CIA, going as far back as the 80s when Clinton was a governor. They are protected and have blackmail on others. As information has flowed more freely and openly via the rise of the internet and social media the CIA has increased its footprint on the mainstream media with affiliates like CNN and The Washington Post.</p>

<p>The mistake too many people make is in thinking that if the Clintons and the CIA and the Deep State are evil then Trump and the Republicans must then be good or somewhat better. They aren&#39;t. All of them are bad and have been in a war with each other these past two years. Trump is just as corrupt as the Clintons—however that doesn&#39;t mean that Trump can&#39;t be on the right side on occasion and ditto for the Clintons. The United States is but a chessboard to them and we are all the pawns. The mega donors and corporations dictate how they act and which chess piece goes where. </p>

<p>Trump has also indicated publicly he knew of Epstein’s interest in “younger” women, although he never suggested the financier crossed any legal lines. “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,’’ Trump told New York Magazine back in 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>

Why are there sworn testimonies from the underage waitresses saying they saw Bill with underage girls?

Virginia Roberts is the girl&#39;s name. She also said she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew. They are pictured together here:

In a 2011 interview with her attorneys, Virginia Roberts, one of the teenagers preyed upon by Epstein, said he had told her he had &quot;compromising&quot; information on Bill Clinton and that the former president &quot;owes me a favor.&quot;
<a href="https://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton">https://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton</a>
So that alone is proof Epstein has blackmail on Clinton.
According to a 2011 court filing by alleged Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre, she saw Clinton and Prince Andrew on the island but never saw the former president do anything improper. Giuffre has accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her when she was a minor, a charge Buckingham Palace denies.

<p>Look, nobody&#39;s disputing that OP is a child rapist. The point is that OP being a child rapist has nothing to do with the questions he&#39;s posing.</p>

<p>I do find it odd, however, that OP is frothing over the mouth about Hillary - the failed candidate - whilst doesn&#39;t mention at all that <strong>the President, Donald Trump, was close friends with Jeffrey Epstein and had numerous visits to Lolita Island aboard Epstein&#39;s private jet</strong>. POTUS controls a nuclear arsenal and is the head of the US government; surely it&#39;s more concerning that the <em>most powerful politician in the world</em> is a potential child rapist?</p>

<p>Must&#39;ve just slipped his mind, eh?</p>

<p>He’s not posting “questions”. He’s making statements he can’t or won’t back up and throwing a fit when I point that out. Which was my point, if you want to make accusations then use proof. </p>

<p>That was just a fun solution of mine knowing a guy who responds to 10 day old messages gets easily triggered. I even said it was sarcasm because the point was to show that baseless accusations are worthless without proof. </p>

<p>Personally, I’m all for holding Bill and Donnie equally accountable. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t fiction Bill has taken 25+ flights on pedo express.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t fiction 4 more women have recently accused Bill of sexual assault. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t fiction Epstein has blackmail on Clinton.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t fiction that <a href="/u/stonetear">/u/stonetear</a> was literally caught in panic mode deleting Hillary&#39;s emails, and was given immunity. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t fiction that Bill was smuggling coke as governor in Arkansas.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t fiction that the Clintons surround themselves with sexual deviants, including rapists and child molesters.</p>

<p>What fictional war are you speaking of?</p>

<p>These are just a small portion of the mountains of incriminating evidence against the Clintons.</p>

<p>If you want to make a post about Trump and Epstein feel free, but as I stated previously, Trump has spoke on his situation and Bill&#39;s situation regarding Epstein. There is a full deposition available. </p>

<p>Bill Clinton has yet to speak on his relationship with Epstein. Trump has. That&#39;s the difference. This isn&#39;t partisan. Trump is a scumbag. The Clintons are scumbags. Capeesh?</p>
