<p>qanon is a fraud</p>

<p>its just asking questions, no answers. He was wrong about indictments for WEEKS now, they never came and its nearly a month later.</p>

<p>all he does is say &quot;Its coming soon, keep following&quot; and never gives anything.</p>

<p>ITs a giant larp and if you think anything else until q anon actually provides something substantial with evidence there is no reason to think otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Soros is pretty much totatally award now that Trump is draining the swamp and all the swamp members are freaking out. The Saudi drainage was a big milestone in trumps career that has the swamp in full panic mode. </p>

<p>Trumps team wanted to ice the Rothschild banking mafia family and raid Langley CIA headquarters to end operation mockingbird and CIA rule. Meanwhile Soros was making a lot of movements which I am not sure of other than he wanted to pull a coup and probabaly failed. </p>

<p>Trump did raid that CIA HQ and he sent a helicopter to capture or kill some of the Rothschilds at some museum (or some building) they own. His intel was good so they sent a helicopter to go after them but a deep mole Rothchild agent pretending to be a white hat ratted Trump out to the Rothschilds. At that point the Rothschilds shot that’s helicopter out of the sky using some kind of laser beam or invisible weapon. </p>

<p>Lynn de Rothschild then sent a hidden message telling the Clintons to make a run for it before Trump mops them up. </p>

<p>That’s the best I could make out of it all. </p>

When I was a teenager in the 90&#39;s I believed a whole lot of bullshit I read on the internet(the FEMA camps have been opening for over two decades btw.) Maybe it was because I saw the real world as so boring because I was a kid? I still have my conspiratorial leanings, but I learned to discern the bullshit, which this obviously is, from the real conspiracies. I don&#39;t mean to be condescending, but how many of these need to be posted before you realize it&#39;s pure bullshit and start looking at why these things get lent any credence? I think that&#39;s the real conspiracy. </p>
