        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We live in a world where people love a show (stranger things) about dimensions, negative entities that can take over your body, psychic powers, dimensional portals, people who can channel, government mind control aka MKUltra, underground bases, shadow government, satanic elite who kidnaps children (Demogorgon) the ugliness of mankind and power by using the innocence of children...&amp; how love can save them.</p>

<p>BUT when we talk about those same subjects in REAL LIFE...in our government and celebrity culture, the majority is in denial and does not want to see it happening in our reality.  But it is and has for hundreds of years.  Hence what is happening now and the consequences of us doing nothing.  </p>

<p>Btw did you know that the show was originally called Montauk. Look up Montauk project if you don’t know about it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched it very much into the whole genre / plot and characters. I think parts of it are very weak, other parts are very good. The whole &quot;stranger things best tv show ever&quot; thing is pretty blind. The last episode of the first season was pure shit. Everything about it was rushed and predictable. I also hate that the writers were only willing to kill the absolutely most disposable character early into the show, then eventually everyone else is back. They also continued the plot into the next season, which I haven&#39;t watched, because the pure shock / revealing of the first season seemed to be the most important part, other than that you simply have a bunch of kids running around a city on their bikes. I can&#39;t imagine the second season gives you too many &quot;omg wtf&quot; moments since they seemed totally blown on the first season. And nothing about it was so crazy. It was like a very long episode of the X-files in which everyone&#39;s eventually forgiven and no one really has to suffer. X-files would have killed more people off and never looked back. Maybe the second season is good, but IDK haven&#39;t had time or desire to watch it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I usually don&#39;t say things like this, but the 2nd season of Stranger Things surpassed the first. But then again, I look at shows in a completely different way and look for symbols and esoteric meanings....which season 2 is packed to the brim of them so much so that I want to go back and rewatch season 1 to see what I missed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya me neither. I hate that after two seasons I still have no idea about what this shadow world exactly is. I think the narrative is very confusing and the plot really lacks depth. Good acting tho, and you gotta love Wynona, absolute goat.</p>

<p>Parallel universe maybe but considering it was kinda like a silent hill type universe Idk. Tbh it could just be another dimension. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See the thing is, the series could have made an effort to explain this, but it&#39;s risky to do this, so they just decided to make it all about some bunch of cute kiddos who don&#39;t really change throughout the entire series.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But they did though? I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s that important at this point and time in the show.  Idk man all of them changed especially if your looking at both seasons.</p>

<p>Considering the show is centered around children I would only imagine the show was go about it as if kids.</p>

<p>Upside down is like kiddie alternate dimension? </p>

<p>Idk i think you&#39;re being to serious?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See the thing is, the series could have made an effort to explain this, but it&#39;s risky to do this, so they just decided to make it all about some bunch of cute kiddos who don&#39;t really change throughout the entire series.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate when things explain everything, personally. Makes me feel like the people writing the show/film are condescending and treating me like an idiot, so I tune out. It&#39;s why I hate films that explre the back story fo horror villains to try to explain why they are the way they are, rather than leaving well alone and allowing the mystery to remain.</p>
