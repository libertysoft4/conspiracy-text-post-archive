<p>We need to stop fighting amongst ourselves and realize the reality they are feeding us through THEIR media outlets is a false narative designed to divide us. Pretty soon that&#39;s the only narritive we&#39;ll be able to see if NN is repealed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly what I was thinking.... the conservative and liberal news channels are both on the same side, they are just playing it up to excite emotions and get people to pick a side. Its like Mayweather v McGregor, both hyping it up just for more money.... but on a larger scale with media and politics. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust TV in general one bit.... funny how Russia&#39;s RT really is one of the least bias news out there lol. I watch it mainly for Abby, but still atleast they cover wide variety of stuff and don&#39;t hold back .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone thought about what net neutrality is going to do to &quot;citizen journalism&quot;?</p>

<p>I think the main side effect they are going for is control over the news cycle through limiting and restricting sources.</p>

<p>People will now &quot;lock in&quot; to their &quot;preferred&quot; source since having multiple sources will require more money. </p>

<p>It would be easy to create an artificial internal internet just through price restrictions. You will eventually be served the same type of model as China except it&#39;s enforced through capitalism.</p>

<p>Right, because an idea like Net Neutrality wasn&#39;t spearheaded by Comcast using Sandvine to block/slow bit-torrent traffic during the fucking Bush years.  Or how about the time they stacked the courtroom by paying homeless people to show up and &quot;represent supporting Comcast&quot; so by the time <em>actual people actually wanting to be involved in the process showed up</em> the entire courtroom was full of people who didn&#39;t give a shit about what was going on but had just been handed $50 to get out of the cold for a few hours.</p>

<p>Sure, it was just an Obama power grab.  Obama must have fucking loved The Pirate Bay, considering they were one of the spawning grounds for the idea of Net Neutrality, with how often they were being throttled and blocked.</p>

<p>How the fuck old are you?  Were you over 10 years old when Bush Junior was President?  If you are older than that, you don&#39;t exactly have a fucking excuse for this bullshit historical revisionism which ignores all the <em>citizens</em> who spearheaded this idea and had endless issues with ISP&#39;s for decades.</p>

<p>exact thing as happened on the internet between the 1990&#39;s-2015.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s a brief history on what the internet companies were doing that triggered Net Neutrality to be put in place:</p>

<p>MADISON RIVER: In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.</p>

<p>COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.</p>

<p>TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T: From 2007–2009, AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&amp;T when it came on the scene in 2009.</p>

<p>WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.</p>

<p>MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.
PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites.
AT&amp;T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.</p>

<p>EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace.</p>

<p>VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T: In 2012, AT&amp;T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&amp;T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&amp;T’s own products.
VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.</p>

<p>And all those things were fixed. In other words, you just proved these situations can and have been handled without net neutrality regulations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly, you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. I&#39;ll explain why those things could be fixed before net neutrality, but can&#39;t be fixed by the FCC if net neutrality laws are removed.</p>

<p>Up until 2014 the FCC could stop the ISPs from doing this stuff. In 2014 the DC Circuit court ruled that the FCC had no authority over internet providers as ISPs were not &quot;common carriers&quot;</p>

<p>In 2015 the FCC classified ISPs as common carriers which subjects them to Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and allows the FCC to enforce net neutrality. If that classification goes away then it falls back to the ruling of the Court and the FCC will have no power to stop this sort of stuff like they could before.</p>

<p>Do you get it now? Do you understand why the anti net neutrality propaganda you&#39;re spreading is completely baseless? Can you see how your argument completely falls apart when faced with any evidence at all? Even when you move the goalposts?</p>

<ol>
<li>Very few homes are able to have a sattelite set up (either due to space, bad coverage, or landlords not allowing it.</li>
<li>Fewer homes have fiber optics, so they need a different option</li>

<p>Most people are then either stuck with Comcast, or use an IP that will most likely become part of Comcast since Comcast has a HUGE monopoly here.</p>

<p>The cable television industry is an entirely distinct industry that operates under different conditions. Bundles are required for small channels to even exist. I&#39;d think if you searched &#39;why are television channels bundled&#39; you could find a compelling write-up, and you&#39;d also see how that dynamic has no practical application to websites.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Comcast was paid off by Netflix to not throttle them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a wholly inaccurate statement to it&#39;s core and it represents complete non-understanding of the issue.</p>

<p>Netflix, 1 single entity out of the millions that utilize Comcast infrastructure, was consuming 40% of the available bandwidth on the entire service. This is harmful to Netflix, to Comcast, to the other entities on the network, and to end consumers. You can&#39;t have a single service grow to dominance on limited pipelines, so-to-speak.</p>

<p>Comcast and Netflix sat down at the business table, and hammered out a deal that was favorable to both of them. Netflix pays it&#39;s fair share of the service it&#39;s utilizing, and Comcast gets a monetary solution to it&#39;s congested network. Now they can expand, increase bandwidth, and not resort to having to logically throttle anyone be it Netflix or the other services on the network.</p>

<p>This is called a business deal.  It&#39;s how all private business functions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you think they WOULDN&#39;T start rolling out tiered internet plans?</p>

<p>Because they haven&#39;t for the past 30 years, and when NN gets repealed they are not about to start.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a show to make you think there&#39;s one team vs another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>C&#39;mon, with net neutrality is almost a binary difference between the parties, and those posting around you told you this with facts</p>

<p>With health care one party expands government health insurance (D) while the other seeks to terminate it (R).</p>

<p>Democrats tend to favor more education spending. Republicans tend to favor reducing it and also allowing it to be used for private (religious) schools.</p>

<p>The Republicans tend to favor military spending increases. The democrats do as well at times, but they appear to want to limit or reduce it at times too. When have Republicans done that?</p>

<p>Obama was more diplomatic than Trump, but I have to agree with you here. It seems the deep state plays this fiddle for the most part. Our war behavior remains largely the same between presidencies, but remember that presidents have to rely on the corrupted (covertly by big economic interests) intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>Both parties will fail to change the status quo of the debt-based fiat money scam. That&#39;s understandable, as most people are too emotionally weak to independently examine that issue while experts and the media dazzle them with jargon and misleading bullshit. However, Democrats put some more customer protection into the system as of late, which the Republicans have shown clearly their intent to dismantle.</p>

<p>So, while we have a huge problem with big economic players corrupting financial regulations and foreign policies to serve themselves at others&#39; expense, we do have some very real differences between the parties on many important issues. Of course money and military issues are close to the core of survival for us. We really need to get the worms out of our state. They answer to the biggest economic players. If we tap any phones or Internet connections, it should be theirs. Throughout history, they have been the most willing and able to subvert the will of the people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, well first off your analogy is fucked because there is no &quot;US Postal Service&quot; of the internet. You can&#39;t choose the public option OR a private service when choosing internet providers. </p>

<p>You can only choose private or no internet. </p>

<p>So the government isn&#39;t setting any prices, they&#39;re just regulating how ISPs are allowed to charge. They can charge a billion dollars an hour to use their service if they want, or charge nothing. Government don&#39;t care about that, that&#39;s free market decisions. </p>

<p>What they&#39;re saying is that ISPs can&#39;t choose the speed at which certain data is allowed to flow through their infrastructure. So they can&#39;t decide to allow CNN priority access to your computer while slowing down Reddit because Reddit won&#39;t pay the ISP for access. And they can&#39;t charge you extra if you want Reddit at the same speed as CNN. </p>

And then launched into the litany of reasons why this is crazy, with her guest Xeni Jardin, activist and editor of Boing Boing. An entire segment dedicated to shining a light on this travesty.

    <div class="md"><p>What if this was the &quot;long term plan&quot; of the internet.</p>

<p>Phase 1 - Create an &quot;open network&quot; for citizens, businesses, news outlet to use for sharing ideas, music, media etc; in order to build users trust.</p>

<p>Phase 2 - Once trust established introduce social networks to get people&#39;s private data and create psychological dependence on said social networks.</p>

<p>Phase 3 - Once step 2 in place, enforce total control on the &quot;open network&quot; in order to gain total control of what is shared by citizens, businesses, news outlet.</p>

<p>Basically we all have a giant two ways screen we created ourselves, in our houses.</p>

<ol>
<li>Very few homes are able to have a sattelite set up (either due to space, bad coverage, or landlords not allowing it.</li>
<li>Fewer homes have fiber optics, so they need a different option</li>
</ol>

<p>Most people are then either stuck with Comcast, or use an IP that will most likely become part of Comcast since Comcast has a HUGE monopoly here.</p>

<p>So no, there is no competition or free market at all. You either get screwed by one monopoly, or screwed by another, and getting rid of Net Neutrality will just let them screw us bad enough to make Weinstein look like a saint.</p>

<p>Instead, you&#39;re advocating that heavy internet users be subsidized by light internet users. You&#39;re advocating for regulations that pave the way for a government takeover ensuring mass future censorship.</p>
