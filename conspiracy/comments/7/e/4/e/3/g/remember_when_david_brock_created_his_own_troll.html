        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In early 2016 he targeted his army of shills to go after Bernie supporters online with a $1 million budget. He has since restructured to better hide his troll farm and has received over $40 million more in funding.</p>

<p>From April 2016,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Citing “lessons learned from online engagement with ‘Bernie Bros,’” <strong>a pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC is pledging to spend $1 million to “push back against” users on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Instagram.</strong></p>

<p>Some Bernie Sanders-supporting users on Reddit already started to notice the changes on Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p><strong>“This explains why my inbox turned to cancer on Tuesday</strong>,” wrote user OKarizee. <strong>“Been a member of reddit for almost 4 years and never experienced anything like it. In fact, in all my years on the internet I’ve never experienced anything like it.”</strong></p>

<p>Watson previously worked at Brock’s Media Matters for America, where “their whole mission is to debunk conservative misinformation [and] a lot of that ends up being defending Hillary Clinton,” but says she’s never seen anything like this initiative.</p>

<p>“Usually places like MMFA and CTR are defending her against the media and established figures. <strong>This seems to be going after essentially random individuals online,” she said. “I don’t know that they’ve done anything like this before.”</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  Another thing is we have divided government so if some ahole congressman puts in an amendment to give tax breaks to private jet owners did trump ask for that?  Or was it put in there to make him look bad?  On a must pass tax bill he has no line item veto- so he can&#39;t to much about it. </p>

<p>Personally, as a rabidly anti-Hillary Bernie supporter, I appreciate how they handled the Russian Sanctions when it passed through congress and what the admin said in response.  I think they really are into rule of law and constitutional government.  </p>

<p>Although I don&#39;t think they&#39;re philosophy of letting corporations do whatever they want is good in the long run.   And him putting in Agit Pai there to kill net neutrality is horrible.  </p>

<p>Other than that, he&#39;s winning me over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s more. The author from this article infers that David Brock patterned and got his strategies for his shill army from Russia&#39;s troll farm. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the part of what the troll farm did to Russian internet. Does this sound familiar?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of these employees spent their time posting in comments sections, while others went so far as to start their own blogs on seemingly non-political subjects, only to weave political messages into their content when they had an audience. But this wasn’t just about convincing Internet users to support the Kremlin’s positions. <strong>It was also about turning the Internet into a political wasteland, so that if anyone sought information that might be against Kremlin policy, they’d encounter a confusing morass and feel immediately discouraged.</strong> Chen met with a liberal campaign manager named Leonid Volkov who emphasized this point:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The point is to spoil it, to create the atmosphere of hate, to make it so stinky that normal people won’t want to touch it,”</strong> Volkov said, when we met in the office of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation. “You have to remember the Internet population of Russia is just over 50 percent. <strong>The rest are yet to join, and when they join it’s very important what is their first impression.”</strong> The Internet still remains the one medium where the opposition can reliably get its message out. But <strong>their message is now surrounded by so much garbage from trolls that readers can become resistant before the message even gets to them</strong>. During the protests, a favorite tactic of the opposition was making anti-Putin hashtags trend on Twitter. Today, waves of trolls and bots regularly promote pro-Putin hashtags. What once was an exhilarating act of popular defiance now feels empty. “It kind of discredited the idea of political hashtags,” says Ilya Klishin, the web editor for the independent television station TV Rain who, in 2011, created the Facebook page for the antigovernment protests.</p>

<p>Tells you that Reddit is social media.  </p>

<p>If you look explicitly at either ShareBlue or CTR&#39;s mission, it never specifies platforms, but it clearly states that it will operate on any social media platform.  You are trying to assume that Reddit, one of the top 25 websites in terms of internet traffic, doesn&#39;t get targeted.  Am I correct?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your entire first paragraph is disingenuous.  Have you read anything i posted?  How exactly do you think Correct the Record operates if there is no one on the payroll to actually do it?  Also, why would he specify making an online presence on social media platforms?  Can you not put two and two together?  Lastly, he has no incentive to specify which platforms he is going to have shills on, because then people will outright discredit everything from that platform.  In fact, he never outright admits what platforms he does target, but they are obvious.  He is no Goebbels, but he isn&#39;t that stupid either.  But fine, maintain your assertion.  I already knew there was no way to convince you otherwise, but thanks to you, this will be seen by others who can actually think critically.  </p>

<p>Where did I say that? They hire people to create infographics that can be used on social media, like the original press release stated.</p>

<p>Because of what I just said, they make infographics that can be used on social media to &quot;push back&quot; against the GOP&#39;s smear campaign.</p>

<p>Right, which is why I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re so mad that I pointed out the only source that suggests CTR or ShareBlue pay people to post on Reddit is an <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> <a href="http://reddit.com/user/OKarizee">user</a>.</p>

Nobody would actually follow an account that would tweet that much so it had nothing to do with Hillary&#39;s historic loss to Trump.   On the other-hand, Hillary paid CTR to create troll farms of idiotic people that hate America as much as she does in order to harass any patriot online that they deemed against her.  </p>

<p>Yet these troll farms persist after the election, even though Hillary said she wasn&#39;t running again.  But we know that is a lie because the sheer volume of trolls here on Reddit.  </p>

<p>I never said Donald Trump did this, I&#39;m saying that pro-Trump bots outnumbered pro-Clinton bots 5-1.  I think it&#39;s worth investigating where the money came from for all those bots to be created and put to work and who ordered it.  It was no secret that the Trump campaign was spending way less money than Clinton&#39;s endless money machine was.  </p>

<p>And you&#39;re also making a GIANT assumption that no one sees those tweets that is kind of hilarious.  Who spends that kind of money, sets up that kind of infrastructure, on something they <em>know won&#39;t work</em>?</p>

<p>Stop just trying to blanket defend Trump because you&#39;re a the_donald poster and look at what happened.  I provided evidence of bot farming seriously leaning toward one candidate, everyone else in here is just circlejerking &quot;Clinton did it and still is!&quot; which is evidence-less.

I see the same person who did it published an almost identical misleading study prior to the election.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what is so confusing. Some of these critics of &quot;CTR&quot; pretend like the GOP has been totally honest with their messaging tools as well. The Clinton Campaign&#39;s methods of narrative control aren&#39;t exclusive to them. Both sides engage in this shit and it&#39;s hard to believe pointing that out comes with accusations of being a CTR shill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the mid 90’s, David Brock was a huge anti Clinton conservative. He wrote pieces on them, and I remember correctly, worked closely with Peter Smith, a GOP operative who openly despised the Clintons. He tirelessly searched for smear pieces against them. David Brock became a Democrat and apologized for his conservatism and his smearing of the Clintons, and now we know his role in Control the  Record. So we know where he is. But Peter Smith? Well, he “committed suicide” shorty after trying to obtain Hilary’s emails by placing a bag over his head and filled with helium. His suicide note said something to nature of, “NO FALSE PLAY. LIFE INSURANCE POLICY”. </p>

<p>Years ago before David Brock was a founder of Media Matters, he attacked attorney and professor Anita Hill in his book called &quot;The Real Anita Hill - The Untold Story.&quot; Some will remember in the early 1990s during President George Bush Senior&#39;s Regime, Anita Hill and other women testified in front of the Senate about Clarence Thomas&#39; sexual harrassment, but the Senate still confirmed Bush&#39;s appointment of Thomas to the Supreme Court. Judge Thomas is still on the Supreme Court to this day of course.  To think Thomas replaced Justice Thurgood Marshall.  Boggles the mind.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the part of what the troll farm did to Russian internet. Does this sound familiar?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of these employees spent their time posting in comments sections, while others went so far as to start their own blogs on seemingly non-political subjects, only to weave political messages into their content when they had an audience. But this wasn’t just about convincing Internet users to support the Kremlin’s positions. <strong>It was also about turning the Internet into a political wasteland, so that if anyone sought information that might be against Kremlin policy, they’d encounter a confusing morass and feel immediately discouraged.</strong> Chen met with a liberal campaign manager named Leonid Volkov who emphasized this point:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The point is to spoil it, to create the atmosphere of hate, to make it so stinky that normal people won’t want to touch it,”</strong> Volkov said, when we met in the office of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation. “You have to remember the Internet population of Russia is just over 50 percent. <strong>The rest are yet to join, and when they join it’s very important what is their first impression.”</strong> The Internet still remains the one medium where the opposition can reliably get its message out. But <strong>their message is now surrounded by so much garbage from trolls that readers can become resistant before the message even gets to them</strong>. During the protests, a favorite tactic of the opposition was making anti-Putin hashtags trend on Twitter. Today, waves of trolls and bots regularly promote pro-Putin hashtags. What once was an exhilarating act of popular defiance now feels empty. “It kind of discredited the idea of political hashtags,” says Ilya Klishin, the web editor for the independent television station TV Rain who, in 2011, created the Facebook page for the antigovernment protests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are saying the Trump Campaign paid millions for an army of trained trolls working for a very unpopular candidate to sit in a room with sophisticated social networking software meant to simultaneously overwhelm and attack accounts that make comments indicating they might vote for Hillary or are you referring to the Deplorables engaging in The Great Meme war of 2016?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your entire first paragraph is disingenuous.  Have you read anything i posted?  How exactly do you think Correct the Record operates if there is no one on the payroll to actually do it?  Also, why would he specify making an online presence on social media platforms?  Can you not put two and two together?  Lastly, he has no incentive to specify which platforms he is going to have shills on, because then people will outright discredit everything from that platform.  In fact, he never outright admits what platforms he does target, but they are obvious.  He is no Goebbels, but he isn&#39;t that stupid either.  But fine, maintain your assertion.  I already knew there was no way to convince you otherwise, but thanks to you, this will be seen by others who can actually think critically.  </p>
