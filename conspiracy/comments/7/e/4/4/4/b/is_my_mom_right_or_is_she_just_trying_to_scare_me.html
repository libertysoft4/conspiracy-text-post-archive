        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have neurofibromatosis and I have an inactive tumor in my brain and I get MRIs every few months (like 3/4) and she said I&#39;m going to get cancer and die because the government wants us dead. She said if I do have a tumor that has grown she&#39;s not going to get it removed but do something homeopathic. She said that because 1 out of 3 people have cancer and I have 2 sisters that don&#39;t have anything I&#39;m going to die before I graduate college (yes I&#39;m 20 and scared shitless about what my mom says. I know I can do what I want which is why I&#39;m getting it removed if anything happens, but what if I get cancer and die?). My mom tells me the government is trying to kill us all, and she&#39;s anti-vax so I never really listened to her until she said doctors and the government are out to get me and I&#39;m going to die from my NF...</p>

<p>Can I trust doctors to take care of my NF? Can I trust them to remove tumors and not give me brain cancer? Can I trust MRIs to not give me cancer? Sorry if this isn&#39;t the place for this..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would always get a 2nd and even a 3rd opinion from different doctors. Do not trust just 1 doctor.</p>

<p>Also, do your own research on the different types of treatment available for what you have. Read everything you can find.</p>

<p>I believe there are good doctors out there that we can definitely trust. Just make sure you go to 2 or 3 different doctors. I wouldn&#39;t trust just 1 (like I already said).</p>

<p>And STAY POSITIVE! It has been proven that worrying and being negative affects our health in a bad way. So stay positive! You said it is an inactive tumor, so that is good!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t imagine a mother being so insensitive to your feelings as to say such things as you describe. I&#39;m really sorry she seems to be off her rocker when you are struggling with a serious condition and need all the support you can get.</p>

<p>Since your mother seems to be a victim of tunnel vision and negativity, I suggest you try to ignore her sentiments as often as possible.</p>

<p>Trust your doctors here. They are certain to be more reasonable than your mother.</p>

<p>I hope you have a long lifetime ahead. Modern medical treatment can and does work. Be well and do the right things for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are the fucking worst kind of human. No, Jesus isn&#39;t going to do a god damn thing for his condition. All those fucking people who placed faith in their healing in &quot;Jesus&quot; and died horrible, avoidable deaths. Stop telling people to believe in your invisible friend. If you believe in God, hey, that&#39;s great. I&#39;m genuinely and unironically happy for you. However, stop trying to push your fairy stories on those in need.</p>

<p>To OP: I agree with the sentiment that you should always get a second or third opinion, but do. Not. Listen to your mum. Ignore everything she says, and as long as the doctors all agree on diagnosis and treatment options, pick the one who vibes best with you and trust his/her opinion. With very few exceptions, most doctors are selfless, amazing people who just want to make the world a better place. Even if the government did want you dead, (which I know, is arguable..) very few if any doctors would do what the government wants, against the will and well-being of their patients. </p>

<p>Find a doctor who feels right and vibes right, and follow their directions. That, and like someone above said, stay positive. Being negative has enormous and mostly-as-yet untold horrific consequences on both our psyche and our well-being. Stay positive. You are living in the time in our world with the best medical care available. Very few things are said-and-done death sentences anymore.</p>

<p>I&#39;m here if you want to talk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most definitely do your own research, get second opinions,  try to reduce your chances of it turning cancerous in the first place...various natural cures(such as cannabis oil) have potential to reduce the size of a tumor, there is some truth in what your mom says, and not every doctor or treatment is in your best interest.  You came to conspiracy because you want to know if we trust doctors, well many of us don&#39;t. Especially when it comes to cancer, doctors have been butchers in treating this disease in some cases, but sometimes that&#39;s what it takes and that&#39;s all we have available.  Im personally interested in learning more about this guy <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/2017/08/08/cancer-cure-suppressed-80-years-theyre-finally-admitting-royal-rife-right/">http://truthstreammedia.com/2017/08/08/cancer-cure-suppressed-80-years-theyre-finally-admitting-royal-rife-right/</a>   but I&#39;m really not well versed in your specific disease, wish I could tell you more. I wish you all the best, keep thinking positive, remember your body is an energetic system, fear and hate and paranoia and all types of negative thoughts feed back into this system eventually manifesting as some type of disorder. Don&#39;t be too hard on your mom, she&#39;s just another human trying to figure out the truth in this blizzard we are in</p>

<p>I believe that the secret societies have infiltrated our government and plan on creating a one world totalitarian socialist government; the New World Order.  Some think Trump is &quot;draining the swamp&quot; but I will believe it when I see it.  These people do want us dead or to milk us like cattle (by milk I mean take your money or other things).  Your health is more important for you than researching this subject at this time so I encourage you to focus on researching the treatment for your condition.  Hopefully someone here has good sources.</p>

<p>I think doctors are vastly more trustworthy than the government.  Some of them do sell out to Big Pharma.  Make sure you find a good one that you trust.</p>

<p>Big Pharma is also trying to milk you for money.  They are a business after all.  That is one of the reasons some people go for the more natural treatments.</p>

<p>You may be interested in searching this sub for posts on the unusually high number of holistic doctors who have been killed.</p>

<p>The down vote bots are burying this request for help.  Sad.</p>

<p>I will x-post this to my sub to try to get you more help.</p>

<p>I will pray for you and your health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for the MRI, its benefits probably outweigh the risks. Look into keto diet for a preventative measure. Cancer loves sugar. Feed your body fats instead. lt requires a lot discipline, but if it&#39;s done right, cancer doesn&#39;t stand a chance. There won&#39;t be enough fuel for it to grow. It seems like the medical cartel is to willfully ignorant of this simple aspect of cancer, but it&#39;s real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Senior medical student here: with all due respect, you&#39;re mom is nuts. MRIs don&#39;t give off radiation. You have NF, which causes tunics to occur and grow very rapidly. Listen to your doctor. Those with NF will undoubtedly develop tumors, comparing your risk to the general population is apples and oranges. A second opinion will not change the course of action, you&#39;ll just end up with repeat imaging and a bigger bill. Best of luck </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your mom sounds like a real jerk. I&#39;m an anti vaccer, and my daughter has a neurological condition. I can not imagine ever speaking to her the way your mother has spoken to you! Nor can i imagine discouraging her from seeking proper medical care with fear mongering. And, while I&#39;m generally skeptical of the medical establishment, there are some really great things about modern medicine and technology.</p>

<p>If you are unsure about the medical care you are receiving, get a second opinion. Do your own research. Find doctors you can trust, and ask them to be frank about the possible implications of your frequent MRIs. And, above all, try to stay positive!</p>

<p>No doctor though, would screw you over if you need medical help. You have a medical condition, a serious one judging from other comments here. Your doctor will help you. And if some reason he won&#39;t then the nurses have your back and will help you. If the doctors and nurses drop the ball then the pharmacists/dietitian/Physical therapist/hell the shmuck at the front desk will help you. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they might be dicks about doing it but no one who works at a hospital is going to throw you under the bus because some asshole bureaucrats said to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All Cancer is anaerobic. It is caused by malfunctioning cell mitochondria. Cancer is basically cells that have gone into fermentation as the primary energy source.</p>

<p>Starve it by severely reducing sugar and simple carb intake.</p>

<p>Suffocate it with oxygen. Eat more unprocessed natural oils. DO NOT eat hydrogenated oils. Oils are what cells use to maintain the cellular membrane. Hydrogenated oils do not allow cells to get enough oxygen and this is probably the biggest cause of cancer.</p>

<p>You could look into hyperbaric treatment to increase your oxygen levels.</p>
