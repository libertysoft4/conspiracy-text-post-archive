    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, very interesting.</p>

<p>I just had the thought that Soros does not really have a political agenda on his own, but is just the TPTB specialist for protests. The money he makes by betting against countries or corporations before a set-up protest might just be a by-product for him.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that Soros does not have a political agenda is ludicrous. He&#39;s a brilliant economist (not saying all his theories are correct, however he has some groundbreaking views) and he translates his views into his agenda. It has falsely been presented often as liberalism, which I would actually argue against. He sure has what many here would call &quot;a globalist agenda&quot;, but then again, from his economic views it makes sense. In my opinion he overestimates the value of revolutions, and he seems to fund a lot of them around the world. But then again I am more of a pacifist liberal so that might be the difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know people here see Soros as the embodiment of evil, and I don&#39;t really think that&#39;s completely fair. He is a corporate lobbyist, trying to push an agenda. However does the fact that he has an agenda mean that he&#39;s wrong on every single point?

<p>Same. However, it does help to know who is making this push so that we can ask why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at his 20/20 interview, he doesnt really seem like a man who is largely for human rights. He makes it very clear his goal is to make money. When you say that he sees the internet as a human right, how do you know that? What do you think his intent is? I think he makes his money through protests, movements, and organizations that &quot;stir the pot.&quot; I don&#39;t think George Soros cares about human rights,I think he&#39;s only supporting tbis organization to profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya, I don&#39;t think I can make any sense of this comment. You say Soros is more conservative than the Koch&#39;s? There is a huge difference between the Kochs and Soros. Koch bros are doing everything they can with their money to increase their own wealth, I don&#39;t believe they have any other motive than that (not being judgemental, if the option exists, why not use it?) Soros is way stranger to pinpoint, as he is not always into politics out of financial stimuli, but many a times because he actually tries to improve the world (not judging, we can argue on whether he actually does if you want to). I have no idea what to make of your comparison between russians and jews, but feel free to explain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This doesn&#39;t really mean much tbh. If anything it&#39;s always possible he funded it on purpose to partially sabotage it. Think about it; conservative news networks loathe George Soros and name drop him constantly to try and disavow anything they don&#39;t like. Big networks like Fox News and Breitbart could get ahold of this and start spewing lies about it being a lie so that they can support their donors by helping net neutrality get revoked.</p>

<p>I really just saw the website all over the front page and was curious who was funding it.  Similar to how we need to know who&#39;s lobbying against Net Neutrality, I wanted to know who is lobbying for it.  It&#39;s raises questions in my mind is all and I thought I would share.</p>

<p>Even [Bernie admitted that Open Borders was a Koch Brothers idea]9<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-07-31/bernie-koch-brothers-open-borders">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-07-31/bernie-koch-brothers-open-borders</a>) before he had to concede that principle.</p>

<p>Off the grid immigration and vulnerable refugees are being used as modern day slave labor. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/bernie-sanders-criticizes-open-borders-at-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce/?utm_term=.ebcd564fdbcd">Bernie has said this as well</a>. Idaho dairy farms, for example, have replaced South American undocumented immigrants with ME refugees after the immigrants refused to live in barracks next door to industrial size piles of cow shit. Conditions that would make Upton Sinclair blush.   </p>

<p>As Bernie knows, pick one: 1) Open Borders, 2) Single Payer (taxpayer) Healthcare</p>

<p>Look dude, people who disagree with your puppet candidate in office aren&#39;t evil racists like the corrupt MSM say. Try having an honest conversation with people before name-calling.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question is not whether NN makes sense (it obviously does), but what would Soros backed legislation on the topic look like. That&#39;s where the conspiracy is. </p>

<p>Trump instituting net neutrality would actually pre-empt and somewhat firewall against the eventual passing of it by others, who will no doubt structure the statutes in ways to subtly and completely reverse the entire purpose of it. I honestly don&#39;t trust Trump, except insofar as he is the enemy of my enemy, so I don&#39;t expect him to do this unless he sees some kind of advantage for his image from it (he should, this would be like a Teddy Roosevelt move that would endear him to many in the millenial and younger category). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vote this week is not about NN though.  The vote is for a repeal to classifying ISPs as public utilities.</p>

<p>The result of this is that more government approval will be necessary every time new fiber is laid.  For big companies (Comcast, for example), this hurdle actually helps them, because they&#39;ll probably have an entire office staffed with multiple full-time people just for dealing with the extra red tape.  Their smaller rivals will not be as well suited for dealing with it.</p>

<p>Title 2 of the Communications Act of 1934 also allows public utilities to have a pass on selling customer data.  Public utilities (and currently ISPs) are allowed to do anything they want with your data.  By removing ISPs status as public utilities, they will no longer be able to sell customer data any time they want.</p>

<p>Soros et all has essentially convinced the world that these changes are bad for the internet, when actually the reverse is true!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re being downvoted, but you are correct. It’s the monopolies that fuel the cries for Net Neutrality. If Comcast is the only ISP allowed in your town (because your municipality said they could), then if NN continues, it won’t matter. They can jack up prices for any reason, and you’ll be screwed until you move.</p>

<p>And if monopolies break up, it opens the door for more competition, lower prices, and better options.</p>

<p>So you realize that these big social media giants make money by collecting your information to serve advertising to you.</p>

You can find his financials and posting ridiculous, obvious insider trading based gains in excess of 50% for a decade straight breaking out under Rothschild money with multiple Rothschilds on his board.

<p>I think when a lot of Americans say libertarian,
they mean extreme right libertarians like
Ron Paul, Gary Johnson (pro-TPP Koch bros shill)
France&#39;s Rothschild banker Macron, etc.</p>

<p>But on the political spectrum,
the social axis goes from authoritarian to libertarian.
So there can be left/right libertarians of moderate and extreme degrees.
E.g. libertarian socialists (democratic socialists, anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists,
and other non authoritarian socialists)
and moderate right to centrist libertarians.</p>

<p>I believe extreme right (NEOliberal to full retard free market/no regulations extreme right libertarianism)
economics and extreme authoritarianism both lead to the NWO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not defending Soros, but I <em>do</em> support net neutrality and the right for everybody to have access to the internet without having to pay a great deal of money to big businesses for the privilege.</p>

<p>Was I here before 2017, on this sub? Once or twice, but the amount of bullshit on this sub and the people thinking everybody is out to get them, whether the thing they&#39;re against would actually hurt them or help them - as in the NN case, it would be the latter - is an insult to my intelligence. So I tend to stay away from the lunatics, for my own mental health.</p>

<p>Why am I here now, posting on this sub? It&#39;s because I feel I have a duty to inform the deluded people when they&#39;re so obviously wrong or undergoing some kind of psychological disorder, which I&#39;d say 90% of the &quot;regulars&quot; here are.</p>

<p>And nope, I&#39;m not a &quot;shill&quot; before you accuse me of that, because shills get told what to say and post, which is against my personal beliefs to willingly oblige. I&#39;d rather do and say things because of my own mind having me do/say them, rather than be told what to do/say. Plus, shills get paid money to comment online, which I most assuredly do not.</p>

<p>Though I do find it odd that this sub blocks people from posting for up to 10 minutes sometimes. Hilarious how the sub claiming to be full of shills fighting against their &quot;reality&quot; and &quot;we can&#39;t give in to what we think are lies purported by big business and government to stop us from having a voice&quot; is the one sub that stops people from having a voice. As though perhaps the &quot;you are doing that too much, try again in x minutes&quot; thing that comes up to block people from commenting is designed to have the more sane people stay away from this sub, because it won&#39;t let them try to help those who are very obviously not well, psychologically.</p>

<p>Would u/illuminatedwax care to comment and explain this policy of denying free speech in such a way?</p>

<p>2011 - MetroPCS tried to block all streaming except youtube. (edit: they actually sued the FCC over this)</p>

<p>2011-2013, AT&amp;amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon were blocking access to Google Wallet because it competed with their bullshit. edit: this one happened literally months after the trio were busted collaborating with Google to block apps from the android marketplace</p>

<p>2012, Verizon was demanding google block tethering apps on android because it let owners avoid their $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn&#39;t do that as part of a winning bid on an airwaves auction. (edit: they were fined $1.25million over this)</p>

<p>2012, AT&amp;amp;T - tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money.</p>

<p>2013, Verizon literally stated that the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the net neutrality rules in place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fight to save NN has always felt a little off to me, I don&#39;t want a closed off internet, but I don&#39;t actually know that that is what is happening here. Having not read the laws myself, I can&#39;t just go off memes and FB posts, those are controlled education.</p>

<p>I never thought I&#39;d side with FCC on this one, and still don&#39;t, but I am starting to consider that this, like every other fucking thing that shows up online, is just more BS being thrown at me. Time to go look at the details myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Young voters care more about NN than older voters, and young voters tend to be a Democratic power base more than a Republican one. Therefore, Democrats are historically more likely to vote to protect NN and Obama&#39;s FCC was more protective of it than Trump&#39;s. Democrats want young people getting politically motivated about NN, because some of those people will stay politically motivated about other things they care about, and become reliable voters, activists, and small-money donors for their own pet causes, which nets out to a gain for the blue team. </p>

<p>Net Neutrality shouldn&#39;t be a partisan issue, but it kind of became one naturally because everything eventually does. The solution is NN to become so popular than politicians wouldn&#39;t dare cut it, even Republicans. And that means activism.</p>

<p>What? No they didn&#39;t. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/11/dissecting-the-youth-vote/507416/">Clinton won 18-to-35 voters 55-37. </a>. Young <em>white</em> people voted for Trump, but most young people aren&#39;t white. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not like young voters were super jazzed for Clinton, <a href="https://civicyouth.org/virginia-youth-voter-turnout-doubled-between-2009-and-2017-estimates-suggest/">Ralph Northam won the youth vote by 39 points</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know much about net neutrality but in my country we&#39;ve never had it and it&#39;s been a good thing for consumers and smaller companies because of the growth in competition and innovation.</p>

<p>But we do have very strong consumer protection laws that cover both individuals and businesses. From what I can gather through experience is the US seems to have weak consumer protection laws and is I think is the main reason why companies like Google are able to get away with tweaking algorithms to suit themselves. Those kinds of anti competitive practices would be against the law here. </p>

<p>The other difference is that we only have one infrastructure network for our telecommunications which is free and open for anyone to set up their own service provider company and offer different products. This means the competition lies with different telecommunications and internet products rather than access to the network.</p>

<p>I think if the US dumps Net Neutrality it probably needs to strengthen consumer protection laws so individuals and smaller companies access are protected.</p>
