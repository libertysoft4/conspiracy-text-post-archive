(It reminds me of the time my son was 3 years old and I told him I could fly, but to remember that the Wright brothers were only airborne a few seconds.

<p>No one ever said otherwise.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right. Your point?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What a laugh. You&#39;re really not putting a second of thought into this.</p>

<p>Hmm, I wonder why perhaps they felt like spending time researching better methods and systems might be something people wanted to do.</p>

<p>I mean we used to cross the ocean in big wooden boats so why bother doing anything differently?</p>

<p>A base for practicing before mars? Practicing what? A real space station? Yeah, that exists. You can see it with your own fucking eyes without a telescope as it moves across the night sky. Get a telescope and you can see it even better. Never went to far? Prove it. And don&#39;t say the Van Allen belt, cause that bullshit has been proven wrong as ell. Satellites hang in balloons?

    <div class="md"><p>The space race and moon landing where a show of force and a pr stunt basically. The development of intercontinental ballistics, spy satellites, and air superiority where the primary motivators. The public face of the space race against superior soviet tech ( who beat us in every way in the space race) needed a moral boost. The goal of being the first nation to put a man on the moon was basically the only thing we hadn&#39;t lost at yet. And frankly didn&#39;t really display anything useful as far as militarily. But it&#39;d be like winning an olympic medal in space where previously we had yet to place. Good for moral and nationalism. To complicate matters tho, jfk wanted to work with the soviets and have a joint moon landing with the whole altruistic fantasy notion of peace and progress for a united humanity. This completely undercut the millitary objective of finally beating the soviets at something, ANYTHING, in space and keeping war profitable.</p>

<p>Why not go back? Well, it&#39;s not profitable, and aside from some visionaries, we lack real motivation in the form of independent funding. And someone is going to want to make money or power off such a move.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moon Landing Scepticism and Hollow Earth are overly simplistic (and untrue) attempts to explain certain things. </p>

<p>For Moon Landing the question is why we have not been back to the moon in 50 years, much less further, when almost every other area of Technology has advanced dramatically. I mean, surely there are Military Applictions, or even just ensuring the survival of the Human Race as a backup by living on other planets. And the U.S. and other militaries have spent hundreds of Billions on Military in the intervening years. </p>

<p>Their simplistic answer that there&#39;s some reason landing on the moon wasn&#39;t done or wasn&#39;t possible. Another answer is that advances in space transport have been made but have been kept secret. </p>

<p>With Hollow Earth, it&#39;s, maybe you see something or someone coming out of the ground and come to the conclusion that this means the earth is hollow. Of course that idea violates our physics, a more likely answer is that fairly large open areas exist in the earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s adhere to the official theory for a minute, because what you said raises an interesting question.  Assuming we can send men to the moon in tin cans with 1960&#39;s technology, where SHOULD we be by now, if they&#39;d just kept exploring etc?</p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t it be a manned moon base?  I mean should that have hit by 1990 or something?  What about Mars?</p>
