<p>George Soros and friends pump millions of dollars into NN propaganda.</p>

<p><a href="https://voicesofliberty.com/2015/02/28/ron-paul-on-net-neutrality-it-means-more-government-2/">https://voicesofliberty.com/2015/02/28/ron-paul-on-net-neutrality-it-means-more-government-2/</a></p>

<p>Ron Paul states the obvious, &quot;it means more government&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how the globalists can make so many people dance by threatening their Netflix speeds.</p>

<p>Soros literally funds everything that our neocon government doesn&#39;t want to happen. There is a reason for this. There is a new gang in town and they are a necessary evil for without them, our government will devour us. I suppose people will understand this when it all starts to happen.</p>

<p>Net neutrality didn&#39;t exist before 2015. &quot;Title II&quot; is the second part of the Telecommunications Act of 1934. This is the same act that gives the FCC jurisdiction content control over TV and radio. </p>

<p>our government likes to pass acts like &quot;the patriot act&quot; </p>

<p>Because the USA Patriot Act was named by Republicans who also named things Orwellian like</p>

<p>Protect America Act </p>

<p>Help America Vote Act </p>

<p>Tax Cuts and JOBS Act</p>

<p>Also, ending Net Neutrality is not an &quot;Act.&quot;</p>

<p>George Soros funds Open Secrets and provides the main source of campaign funding information for all major politicians. I side with George Soros on that too, and it is not blind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We the people have researched it. We don&#39;t like it for many reasons including the fact that consolidated companies will cheat to push their own integrated services ahead of everyone else&#39;s, the fact that ISPs will charge content providers opening a whole new source of income to replace actually building more bandwidth, and the fact that we like independent conspiracy sites which will be the last ones capable of paying the content provider fees especially since they were all thrown off Google AdSense.</p>

<p>Also, you can thank Republican Marco Rubio for taking away some of the funding in a must pass budget bill in 2015. At the time, he boasted that higher rates would hit just before the 2016 election.</p>

<p>Now, Republican Donald Trump is deliberately &quot;collapsing&quot; the program without providing his &quot;terrific&quot; health plan that was going to cover everyone for less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think you are the one that needs to do your research. organized labor, aka unions, led the fight against all those practices. </p>

<p>but the corps would literally just hire mercenaries to be &quot;union busters&quot; to straight up attack, intimidate, and even kill labor activists.</p>

<p>government protections were key to giving those unions the upper hand in that fight, and in lobbying the government for laws that would protect them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a free system, if two companies collude to set prices higher or service levels lower, they leave themselves wide open to some new competitor offering lower prices or better service. Only when governments <em>prevent</em> competition (directly, like with ISP regional monopoly grants, or indirectly by subsidies, tarriffs, regulations, and other means) is that kind of collusion possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“For almost twenty years, the Internet thrived under the light-touch regulatory approach established by President Clinton and a Republican Congress. This bipartisan framework led the private sector to invest $1.5 trillion building communications networks throughout the United States. And it gave us an Internet economy that became the envy of the world.&quot;</p>

<p>“But in 2015, the prior FCC bowed to pressure from President Obama. On a party-line vote, it imposed heavy-handed, utility-style regulations upon the Internet. That decision was a mistake. It’s depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation.&quot;</p>

<p>“Today, I have shared with my colleagues a draft order that would abandon this failed approach and return to the longstanding consensus that served consumers well for decades. Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the Internet. Instead, the FCC would simply require Internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate.&quot;</p>

<p>“Additionally, as a result of my proposal, the Federal Trade Commission will once again be able to police ISPs, protect consumers, and promote competition, just as it did before 2015. Notably, my proposal will put the federal government’s most experienced privacy cop, the FTC, back on the beat to protect consumers’ online privacy.&quot;</p>
