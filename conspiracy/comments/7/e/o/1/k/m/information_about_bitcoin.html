My friends are real advocates and have recently invested in bitcoin. They are doing this through a company called USI Tech (Im Australian). 
I searched around this subreddit but I&#39;m still confused about the whole thing so if someone can break it down (ELI5) that would be fantastic!</p>

<p>I just want to know what this community thinks about bitcoin and if possible post some links with information? Do you think it&#39;s worth investing in?</p>

<p>AHAHAA you mean Nakamoto? jesus christ do you know anything? AI? WTF are you talking about? No, Satoshi Nakamoto is a group of people who designed Bitcoin. It&#39;s not an AI. </p>

<p>any who,  Bitcoin is a UTXO based Blockchain with a transaction script language, called Script, is a Forth-like reverse-polish no‐tation stack-based execution language while ethereum is a VM (virtual machine, called EVM, ethereum Virtual machines) which is has a state, and it&#39;s a giant singleton environment. It also has a semi-Turing complete programing language.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>bitcoin is the greatest invention since the internet. It&#39;s up there with human flight, telephone, printing press, automobile, electricity and so on. </p>

<p>The only reason i come to reddit, is to read about crypto (bitcoin/ethereum etc) and conspiracy. I care about no other sub. I&#39;ve been a conspiracy guy since 2003. I&#39;ve been in the tech industry since 1999. Before bitcoin, I was hopeless for the future of man kind. After bitcoin, I have hope. </p>

<p>This guy is the best bitcoin talker out there.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t wanna give financial advice. I suggest you spend a day or so learning about bitcoin and crypto. You might fall in love with it like all the crypto heads i know. The best thing you can do is understand the technology. Understand why it&#39;s so revolutionary. Make up your own mind. It can crash down to zero tomorrow. It can hit 100,000 per coin in a few years. No one knows. This is uncharted waters. But god damn, i love having a window seat on this ship.  What is ethereum?</p>

<p>Thats a whole different ball of wax. It&#39;s bitcoin on steroids. It does way more things, but it has it&#39;s own drawbacks i think it&#39;s a little beyond this topic of conversation. </p>

<p>here is a video to help explain

    <div class="md"><p>another question, please sir.  if somebody did want to invest in.BTC now, what methods would you suggest?  is it as simple as just purchasing BTC for your digital wallet?  are guys acquiring BTC in other ways?  I know that mining is not really attainable for the average person any more, but I am seeing different ads where guys are getting BTC through various services, etc.  I don&#39;t expect to be spoon fed these answers but perhaps you could point me in the right direction...I want to get started.  thank you for your time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>let me help you: </p>

<p>Cloudmining == scam</p>

<p>Bitconnect == scam!!!</p>

<p>BitcoinCash == counterfeit. </p>

<p>these are ways to obtain bitcoin. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>mining (like you said, very industrial now. 6 years too late!)</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a service for it. (best way) do you cut hair? cut hair for bitcoin. Do you fix cars? fix cars for bitcoin. </p></li>
<li><p>buy it at an exchange (coinbase, Gemini) or localbitcoins. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>but like i said, the best thing you can do right now, is study it. Learn about it. read about the history. check out <a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org">http://nakamotoinstitute.org</a></p>

<p>worse thing you can do is hastily invest in something you don&#39;t fully understand. step one! understand the technology. You don&#39;t need to learn math. You just need to understand certain concepts. Plenty of youtube videos to help you. You have no excuse for not learning. There are motherfuckers in india with shitty internet connection and bad english who are learning.  no excuse!! </p>

<p>again: if you see a video that says &quot; this and that help me get free bitcoins!&quot; or &quot;i get 10 bitcoins by signing up here&quot; just run away! SCAMS ARE EVERYWHERE! BE VERY CAREFUL~ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I guess they were\are using people&#39;s machines to mine monero.  Mining bitcoin with a PC is a complete waste of time.  Monero however uses a different mining algo which is still mineable on Pcs. </p>

<p>Watch this video to really understand what mining is.  It will blow your mind </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you&#39;re wrong.  I say this because I went through this with gold.  The reason you&#39;re wrong is the reason you are right, but that is conventional wisdom, and that is why it will not happen like you think.  </p>

<p>I do believe it will be built up more before it is crashed.  I think the sell point is $11,195.  Then the crash.  I don&#39;t know how high it will go after that, but $15K is about right.  It will be a slow ride after the crash though. There will be better returns out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin and blockchain are the future. Do you have coinbase in Australia it is a decent way to buy bitcoin. After you have bitcoin you can exchange it for other cryptocurrencies. Some good exchanges I can recommend are bittrex, poloniex, or binance. Good luck, it’s the Wild West so, protect yourself from hackers buy a trezor or ledger wallet, it’s a small usb hard drive that will keep all your bitcoin and crypto safe. </p>
