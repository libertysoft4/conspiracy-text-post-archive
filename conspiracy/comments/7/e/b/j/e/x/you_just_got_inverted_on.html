<p>When they tell you that you are spinning on a ball at 1000 mph and there is a magical force called gravity keeping you from flying off, you just got inverted on.</p>

<p>When they tell you it would take a million Earths to fill the volume of the sun, when in reality it would take a million suns to fill the volume of the Earth, you just got inverted on.</p>

<p>When they test astronauts in Water instead of a Vacuum, you just got inverted on.</p>

<p>When they tell you the curve of the earth is .666 degrees, and that the Earth spins around the sun at 66,600 mph, you just got Satanic inverted on.</p>

<p>When they show you aerial pics of the ocean through a go pro lens and use that as an Image of Earth, you just got inverted on.</p>

<p>When all rocket launches end up traveling in an arc, you just got inverted on into thinking they get into space going &#39;sideways. You got inverted on again when they don&#39;t show em crash in the ocean.</p>

<p>You got inverted on when NASA officials say their missions &#39;looks like CGI, but it&#39;s not&#39;.</p>

<p>And you got inverted on when you didn&#39;t know they were wearing harnesses in some of the iss astronaut footage, and using virtual augmented reality wrist bans, and doing the same choreographed harness-spins.</p>

<p>You got inverted on with Sputnik, and you probably weren&#39;t even alive yet.</p>

<p>You got inverted on with Copernicus.</p>

<p>And Einstein inverted all over your face.</p>

<p>All these beliefs are lies,</p>

<p>and Inversion.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s part of the Satanism the Freemason organizations that form the shadow government use to control our minds and keep us from the knowledge of our existence. Over generations of information control ,and mass mind control through media, the generations accept Inversion as Truths.  If that is You, you just got inverted on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That article is all conjecture. You can even see how they&#39;re just guessing by the vocabulary they use throughout the article: &quot;It is thought....&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s not obvious how....&quot;, and so on. Then they say they know what is in the center of earth by lab experiments, based on potentially faulty premises, such as the iron content of earth&#39;s center which they assume must ge there simply because &quot;it&#39;s everywhere in the universe,&quot; or how the mass must be based on how they think gravity works. They may be good guesses to some people, but they are still guesses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh wow, you didn&#39;t understand that article at all. Science uses phrases like &quot;it is thought&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s not obvious how&quot; because there is no such thing as scientific certainty. The whole point of science is that every single premise within it is open to reinterpretation when new evidence is found.   </p>

<p>Also, we don&#39;t know that the earth&#39;s core is iron because we&#39;re guessing. We know it&#39;s iron for a few reasons. The most compelling is that we know the size of the earth and its gravitational pull. Using these two measurements we know what the density of the earth has to be. In order to meet the density requirement, the earth&#39;s core must be mostly iron. It&#39;s literally year 1 physics stuff</p>

<p>No, there isn&#39;t. Literally none of their points stand up to even the slightest bit of testing and they are incapable of creating even a working model of the earth, let alone the entire universe. If you believe the earth is flat and that mainstream science is lying to us, then you accept that science was somehow able to create a completely fabricated model of the universe that elegantly explains all known natural phenomenon, holds up to rigorous scientific testing, and can be used as a basis for further discoveries. In other words, believing the earth is flat is ludicrous and worthy of any amount of ridicule</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Then shut the fuck up and do some research. It&#39;s really not hard. You&#39;re willfully admitting that you&#39;re coming into a &quot;debate&quot; that you know nothing about and saying that your opinion should be respected because you&#39;re the one talking right now. How fucking arrogant is that?</p>
