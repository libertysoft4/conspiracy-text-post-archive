<p>Here&#39;s how it all went down, chronologically:</p>

<p>Joe tweeted this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlNKi5etxhk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlNKi5etxhk</a></p>

<p>Then tweeted this article: <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/opinion/4619073/youtube-promises-crackdown-on-disturbing-and-sexually-violent-gore-videos-targeted-at-children/">https://www.inquisitr.com/opinion/4619073/youtube-promises-crackdown-on-disturbing-and-sexually-violent-gore-videos-targeted-at-children/</a></p>

<p>And then tweeted this article: <a href="https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2">https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2</a></p>

<p>And a few moments ago he retweeted this: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElsaGate/comments/7bmq40/codedgibberish_comments/?st=JA5OMLKL&amp;amp;sh=762b6713">https://www.reddit.com/r/ElsaGate/comments/7bmq40/codedgibberish_comments/?st=JA5OMLKL&amp;amp;sh=762b6713</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of people are first hearing about Elsagate through him. If you google the word &quot;Elsagate&quot; the first result that pops up is the <a href="/r/elsagate">/r/elsagate</a> subreddit. And the first post there is &quot;Let&#39;s get real for a second. These videos exist for a reason, and it&#39;s not pedophelia.&quot; </p>

<p>Good timing. </p>

<p>They’re from the same breed that blamed Marilyn Manson for columbine, thought heavy metal summoned satan back in the 80s and every other kooky religious fundamentalist outcry for censorship.</p>

<p>How hard is it to keep your fucking kids off youtube? </p>

<p>Don’t allow them to watch “Spiderman gets Elsa pregnant” or whatever stupid idea they come up with for hits.</p>

<p>These youtube channels are creating content because lazy parents put their autistic kid in front of a computer and leave for the day.</p>

<p>So these channels are blowing up because nobody else is going to click on video after video aftee video after video adter video besides stupid children.</p>

<p>As far as the videos with kids swimming and shit...that is a byproduct of (once again) stupid parents thinking the whole world gives a fuck about Timmy losing his first tooth or Sally’s first time in a swimming pool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I was just gassed by your profanity-laden rant of idiocy. Like, I&#39;m only supposed to look out for my own kids, and I shouldn&#39;t worry about society or other children whose parents suck.</p>

<p>I&#39;m raising my children very well and responsibly. But I worry about <em>all</em> children. Some don&#39;t have good parents. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you carry such anger and hate. This was fun needling you for a while, but now I see you are obviously a broken soul and that&#39;s sad and tragic. You can have the last word, because that&#39;s probably very important to you. I hope you can find the help you need. We&#39;re all in this together, please remember that. </p>

<p>This is different in that it better aggregates children (though the manipulated views call into question how well) and IMO the bot gibberish provide cover for the pedophiles to communicate.</p>

<p>It also, like I keep saying, is a perfect money laundering scheme.  Dirty money is used to buy ads and the bots pump up the views and then the channels get paid.  Someone would be very angry to be so exploited by bots if it weren’t for the fact that it is all done on purpose.</p>

<p>I commented on it at the time:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7dsk9t/joe_rogan_spreading_awareness_about_elsagate_this/dq1acs6/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7dsk9t/joe_rogan_spreading_awareness_about_elsagate_this/dq1acs6/</a></p>

<p>But it&#39;s still the top comment, and it&#39;s just so plainly a distraction. Get everyone talking about whether scandals should have the suffix &quot;-gate&quot;, rather than talking about the scandal. Weird stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a note on reddit mechanics. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume the top comment is vote manipulated (not saying that user is necessarily in on it, just that those who want to slide the conversation are upvoting it for their own purposes.) </p>

<p>The way reddit&#39;s sorting algorithm works is that it considers a comment &quot;better&quot; when it get more comments. So when you make a reply that calls out the top comment (and then you get replies, either for or against you), you&#39;ve incidentally made the the comment you&#39;re calling out &quot;better,&quot; and more likely to stay in the top spot. You&#39;ve also made the thread of that top comment longer, so that people browsing through the conversation are more likely to spend they&#39;re time views discussion about the &quot;-gate&quot; suffix than they are about the actual story.</p>

<p>It may seem counter-intuitive, but I believe your best bet is to downvote and move on in these cases. Especially if there&#39;s another comment calling it out (even if it&#39;s not as good of a call out as you can do), just upvote it and move on. There&#39;s other schools of thought on this, but given how reddit works, calling out a forum slider only ever seems to slide the discussion even further. It&#39;s why it&#39;s so effective.</p>

Her and I and my mother and my brother reported her abuse to the local police department and a month later I was removed from my home with a restraining order. 2 months after that I was unlawfully incarcerated for 11 months until the bogus charges were dropped. Now that these things are finally coming out in the open I don’t feel like the creep for bringing these things up. I have contacted the FBI as well as homeland security. I was homeless for almost 2 years since this. Hacked. I haven’t seen my daughter since 2014. She was 4. I’m sorry I am rambling. I need ideas. I want her out of there. I don’t want her to be the adult that is a pedophile.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know a child who is loving this life. I have contacted the police. And was arrested for 11 months afterwards on bogus charges. The child went to a state funded therapist and concluded these things were happening to her and after seeing the therapist for 2 months a few times a week was put right back into the home. I know for a fact this state funded place that gives therapy to sexually abused children has “covered up” two separate family’s with children being sexually abused. HELP</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with some posts here about this NEVER EVER could be something autogenerated. I did work in multimedia. I did some video and music projects.</p>

<p>I guess you could say the keywords SEO aspect could be autogenerated. But the videos are hand crafted.</p>

<p>Theres a couple website out there, that lets you enter keywords and add your own audio. To generate a &quot;music video&quot;. The keywords you enter, generate images from a pre-existing library. And the website simply picks the most relevant images. Auto-generated doesn&#39;t necessary mean, actually images being drawn by the comuputer. Mostly likely its just computer picked images based on keywords. it all depends on the parameters set by the architects of the &quot;video generator&quot;. </p>

<p>Meaning, if this all could be auto-generated, alot if not all, is a set parameter by the creator. Which shows intent. Which is important to the story. </p>

<p>(One example i saw was Elsa bending over, and some guy holding a kitten behind her backside, and was stroking it gently. Thats not something a computer comes up with.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems pretty clear (to me, at least) what&#39;s going on here. Some foreign content creators are exploiting the fact that children watch Youtube. They add popular characters (Elsa, Spiderman, etc) to attract clicks. They then make them odd/inappropriate to keep them around. Kids know when something is off or wrong, and it keeps their interest. I remember finding an old porn mag in the woods when I was a young kid.  I hadn&#39;t hit puberty, sex or women didn&#39;t interest me at all, but I knew it was something I wasn&#39;t supposed to be seeing and I couldn&#39;t stop looking at it.  Same here, except obviously they can&#39;t show porn on Youtube.  It&#39;s purely a monitization scheme.  </p>

<p>If you notice, most of the cartoon videos are just over 10 minutes.  That&#39;s key. 10 minutes is the magic number for Youtube creators, it means you make more money off ads.  </p>

<p>Now, since all these weird videos blew up, now there are people copying them/turning them into a weird meme (like the live action ones).  Which is why they&#39;re fucking everywhere (with varying lengths).  They kept the themes because they&#39;re so fucking weird to begin with, why mess with a proven formula.  Ironically, now they&#39;re all getting WAY MORE views because we&#39;re all talking about them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They had millions of views before anyone knew about it. You have to realise that Disney etc arent pursuing these people for using and degrading their copyright in this way and making a LOT of money from it when they are usually hot on copyright infringements. Why is that? Also realise whoever is making them knows theyre damaging to kids and knows pedos will watch them and use them to get kids thinking these things are normal or ok. So even if you think their primary motive is money, it really doesn&#39;t change anything about what theyre actually used for and the damage theyre doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Pirates">Air Pirates</a> fiasco, Disney&#39;s policy towards parody and satire copyright infringements seems to be to ignore any given phenomenon until it fizzles out of the public&#39;s awareness. See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_from_Tomorrow">Escape From Tomorrow</a>. Otherwise, they wind up - as you said - giving them free advertising by even addressing it.</p>

<p>Unless Elsagate blows up <em>super big time</em>, Disney probably won&#39;t do a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also assumed it&#39;s a monetization thing, and I can understand &#39;shock&#39; value being a part of that process. But let&#39;s talk about the characters being stepped on by a giant foot, and Elsa inside of a sandwich. In the porn world, bugs or small animals being crushed by a woman is a definite fetish. Women being eaten in some form is also a definite fetish. And then there&#39;s boys and girls sharing lipstick, girls wearing high heels, etc. Something just isn&#39;t right here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, you can create the same video without the crazy manipulative stuff and still get paid. These creators could have easily made 10 minute fluff pieces without the scat and fetish parts and would still be making a killing, because kids will watch anything. What they are doing in these videos is nothing but stimulating sexual awareness with children in order to promote such behaviors later on. Just remember, the same devices these children are watching these videos on also have cameras. Let that sink in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually think that elsagate thread is pretty spot on. The real pedophile problem on Youtube is oblivious kids uploading videos of themselves and their friends doing suggestible things. That&#39;s where you&#39;ll find most of the pedo comments and odd viewcounts compared to other videos on a channel. Most of the elsagate-related content is pretty mild overall as far as possible fetishized content goes, and while there may be some viewers there for the wrong reasons I highly doubt it&#39;s the basis for the millions of views. </p>

<p>Grooming</p>

<p>Learned Helplessness</p>

<p>Normalize inappropriate Behavior</p>

<p>Color Programming</p>

<p>Only the first one is significantly controversial. It <strong>is</strong> a bit of a reach. The only part of this explanation that is rational, is how effective this would be for grooming, although there is little evidence to support that is <strong>actually</strong> what is happening. I&#39;d be fully in support of massively funded investigation of this.</p>
