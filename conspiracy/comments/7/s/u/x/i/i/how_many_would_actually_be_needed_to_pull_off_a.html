So how many would actually have had to have been actively involved, and of those involved how many would have had to have been knowingly involved on a criminal level? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Susan wrote a book, Extreme Prejudice, she was the first person imprisoned under the Patriot Act for claiming she told WH officals she overheard reports of an impending attack while working as a CIA asset.  They were about to dose her into stupidity except some lawyer heard about her and stopped the proceedings to declare her insane. A nightmare for sure.  A former soldier, April Gallop worked at the Pentagon and walked out of the hole where the plane supposedly hit. She claimed to smell cordite, a bomb ingredient and claimed she saw zero plane parts, remains, anything to indicate a plane had made that hole.

    <div class="md"><p>So 9/11, an event so big it would require a massive coverup, couldn&#39;t possibly be coordinated; and a helicopter crash containing say 30 SEALs (none of whom were involved in the raid per MSM, but we&#39;ll pretend for argument&#39;s sake) couldn&#39;t be kept hidden? 35 people need to know. The President, the Secretary of the Army (maybe...) the unit leader, the 30 dead SEALs (who are experts at maintaining gov&#39;t secrecy by the way as their whole lives literally depend on it) and the pilot and co-pilot. If the pilot team are SEALs as well, then only 33 people need to know. If the President doesn&#39;t know, it makes his responses look more &quot;real&quot;. The Sec. doesn&#39;t really <em>need</em> to know, for the same reason. Maybe for budget purposes as he&#39;ll have to justify hiring 30 more seals. </p>

<p>So, this begs the question which is more likely? That 30 SEALs died in a helicopter crash to keep the secret of Bin Laden (while the people that actually killed OBL weren&#39;t even on the helicopter) or that the gov&#39;t said &quot;Hey, so, we need this to happen. You guys are experts at keeping gov&#39;t secrets. Rig this helicopter, &quot;crash&quot; it in the middle of the desert, and either go with the &quot;dead&quot; lie or we&#39;ll keep you on the payroll and change your identity.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot easier to keep 30 government agents in line than it is to keep potentially hundreds or thousands of leaks quiet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine 09/11 was demolition and you were to work for people who want to blow up two skyscrapers and sacrifice thousands of innocent people for their own good.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that you as a regular person probably would not end up in such a position as I can imagine those people are carefully hand picked, you know what will happen to you or your family if you speak out on such topics.
If you are a hired demolitions contractor(mercenary/hitman) you probably do not care at all anyways as long as you get a shitload of cash for it.</p>

<p>To narrow it down, how many people do you really need? 
- A close circle of conspirators planning the whole thing.
- Contractors to place explosives - probably a hand full
- place those contractors in maintenance schedules or arrange a fire training or whatever and get the building evacuated so your people can work for a couple of days
- Use your connections to tell the responsible people it is just a exercise/ training whatever while your demolition guys look like average maintenance crew and plant everything</p>

<p>Soooooo not so many people after all who really know what is happening there.</p>
