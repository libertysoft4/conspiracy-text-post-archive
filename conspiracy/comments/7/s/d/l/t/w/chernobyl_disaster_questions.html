        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Not sure where to turn for this, hoping conspiracy can give me a start.</p>

<p><strong>Some background</strong></p>

<p>I used to be an intelligence officer in the Australian Army with TS and SCI (nothing exciting I just worked in AML).</p>

<p>In my post army life I met a retired Canadian Lt Col who worked alongside department of energy with a Q clearance and we spoke quite often (once a month for nearly 6 years).</p>

<p>He knew a lot of things that he wouldn&#39;t have otherwise known unless he held a high clearance (or was close to someone with one) and he was receiving an army pension in line with his purported rank, so I am confident he wasn&#39;t lying about that.</p>

<p>Some of the information he told me was outed in the media a few months later and a lot of this was quite significant, so he definitely knew alot. Or made a lot of good guesses.</p>

<p><strong>The situation</strong></p>

<p>We hadn&#39;t caught up in a month or so, but before I left for a holiday he told me he&#39;d &quot;tell me some secrets about what really happened at Chernobyl&quot;.</p>

<p>Unfortunately he died in a car accident; nothing unusual or suspicious, his car was t-bone but dude was quite old (like 80) and he sustained some injuries he couldn&#39;t recover from.</p>

<p>So now I have a knowledge inch I&#39;ll likely never scratch.</p>

<p>Are there any sensible theories around this event I can read and give myself some sort of self closure?</p>

<p>Edit. To be clear this is not meant to be a discussion on what I know about unrelated topics. I&#39;m just interested in some general theories on Chernobyl.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The largest was PRISM which was discussed at length well before E Snowden made it public.</p>

<p>Metadata exchanges with NSA.</p>

<p>Guantanamo prison programs.</p>

<p>Plus lots that has not come out yet.</p>

<p>Now to be clear. I am not disputing his rank or his clearance. But even with this information he could have been a paranoid man with a lot of good guesses.</p>

<p>I&#39;m purely exploring this on the assumption he did know these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed.</p>

<p>Interestingly most of these programs would commenced after he retired, which made me believe he was talking to someone in the know more then being in the know.</p>

<p>If there were something to do with this event it would have been something financial or politically motivated.</p>

<p>Nothing regarding Chernobyl.</p>

<p>In fact in reflection, we spoke remarkably little in respect to Russia at all, primary focus was 5 eyes members.</p>

<p>It was very out of character and didn&#39;t fit his profile (aside from his purported Q clearance).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if he had TS clearance and Q clearance he would have access to data on the repercussions of the disaster from an economic standpoint (half of TS reports are economic paperd).</p>

<p>With that I&#39;d &quot;guess&quot; the &#39;woodpecker&#39; never being used again may have been involved (significant cost to write down).</p>

<p>Alternatively the fact the other reactors stayed operational could have forced greater reliance on Russia for power (oil etc).</p>

<p>Both of these are predicated on an intentional event, which seems pretty far fetched given the global impact.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what &#39;the woodpecker&#39; is. The soviets weren&#39;t very much concerned with writing down capital investment and operating costs, as it wasn&#39;t a capital based economy. They didn&#39;t much care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So from what I read. It was related to the Woodpecker. I don’t know how it was done.  By spies or the like but supposedly Western Powers wanted the Woodpecker shut down/overloaded/damaged beyond repair. So a Power Surge in the power system was engineered to destroy the Woodpecker but as a side effect of the power surge it messed up Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station causing the disaster. </p>
