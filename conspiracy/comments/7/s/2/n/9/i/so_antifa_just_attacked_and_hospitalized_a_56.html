<p>Is that all of them and does that happen all the time? Because I&#39;m seeing reports of Antifa violence all over the place. A professor Eric Clanton was bashing people in the head with a Bike Lock. Its just a matter of time before Antifa kill or have already done so</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, we can discuss a few hundred alt left radicals or alt right radicals or illegal fake ass daca killers possibly in the few hundreds.</p>

<p>However, Alt-left has aligned itself with Communism, and the first step is to censor conservatives as we are seeing on youtube, twitter, FB, and reddit. </p>

<p>These Antifa attacks are the canary in he coalmine of what&#39;s coming</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who knows where he went?  I don&#39;t.  But it&#39;s not as though people smashing in your windows with bats and such isn&#39;t a deadly threat, I&#39;d of ran in both cases myself, wouldn&#39;t you have?  He shows up, we don&#39;t know what the story is, but they just start smashing at the car?  What the hell kind of response is that?</p>

<p>He could have gored those people into walls non-stop, it&#39;s a miracle nobody actually got gored.  We don&#39;t know what happened with the girl they showed in green who was on the hood of the car, at least I don&#39;t, she just walked off and went on her merry way of not being Heather Heyer.  </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Jc6aIB3.png">https://i.imgur.com/Jc6aIB3.png</a> Maybe the driver was a government guy, maybe he was who they say he was and he was just fleeing from a gunmen and people with bats, I don&#39;t know.  But if his intent was to kill a bunch of people, he could have done so.  All I see is an attempt to paint those who care about the future of their nation as satanists.</p>

<p>&quot;hello, I don&#39;t want my nation invaded by 35+ million illegals.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;KILL HIM AHH HE&#39;S A NAZI KKK WHITE SUPREMACIST!&quot;</p>

<p>Seriously, over and over I&#39;ve heard this kind of rebuttal to merely wanting the idea of just not letting any old person in.  Racism is an anti-white term to take advantage of whites overly strong sense of empathy and get them to lower their guard so they can be invaded and exterminated.  Truth is, I am a white nationalist, I want what is best for me and mine just like everyone else.</p>

Does it say she was never struck by the vehicle? 3) Where is the proof beyond a supposed now erased facebook post that Fields was fleeing in blind terror from a threat north of the scene of the crime? 4) If there was a threat to the north and Fields thought his safext course of action was to flee south and plow through a crowd of pedestrians who were, at the time, no immediate threat to himself, why, then, once he struck the crowd and a new threat of people with bats appeared again north of his vehicle, why didn&#39;t Fields continue on his predetermined safest course of action of traveling south? 4) Where is the proof that Fields had been diagnosed with and treated for psychotic issues? 5) If he had been, why was he not on medication?</p>

<p>Because that street is blocked for vehicular traffic.  If you weren&#39;t a dumbass just JAQing off you would know that already.</p>

<p>You&#39;re acting as if these events played out over the course of an hour rather than a few seconds, and that people are prone to making rational decisions in moments of total panic.  You realize how absurd that is, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is absurd that certain people are making up any and every excuse for this guy. He&#39;s anything from some poor scared snowflake to some schizo off their meds to not even himself, but instead, a government actor who stole his car or used a decoy and set Fields up. If Fields did in fact get threatened and fled in a blind panic why do prosecutors have video of him backing up before accelerating into the crowd? How long are we supposed to believe he was blind with panic and simply acting irrationally? He fled the scene. I&#39;m sorry, personally, I just don&#39;t believe this individual stayed in this blind zombie like state of panic through all of these situations.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We certainly have more questions than answers.  I am just telling you based on the details available to me how things went down, but I have no greater information.  Someone scared him with a gun, supposedly the paths were blocked by crowds and cops as they were funneling people in specific directions.  The guy drives his car into another car and a girl ends up on the hood but just takes off.  Immediately several come crashing at the car with bats, so he flees.</p>

<p>Really I think though the question is, &#39;what was his intent?&#39;  I think it&#39;s hard to argue his intent related to anything about murdering anyone as it was painted so heavily in the media.</p>

<p>There were people and walls that didn&#39;t get crushed and gored, he could have turned those people into soup.  Sit in the seat of the car in your mind and imagine turning right hard anywhere along that sidewalk.  A river of blood would have been the case.</p>

<p>Well first, there are a lot of assumptions made for clearly nefarious reasons.  Second, who are the media?  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8miS3pX.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/8miS3pX.jpg</a> Do you perceive these people and the media to be honest and trustworthy?  Third, I mentioned previously, no streams of blood, just a morbidly obese girl who had a heart attack.</p>

<p>I think you, like some, are commies who are whitephobic and biased trying so hard to find evil when there isn&#39;t any.  Whites are being attacked and oppressed, but all others care about is illegals.  Affirmative action is preference to hiring non-whites, it&#39;s an anti-white bias in careers, but nobody cares that there is systemic lawful white oppression, it&#39;s all about the jewish slave trade that ended 158 years ago in the USA and how this is some how all whiteys fault so exterminate whites or something.  Were all guilty somehow for the false crimes of our fore fathers in someway.  </p>

<p>Since I was a child my people talked while others invaded, raped, robed and murdered, my people used reason while others used knives and guns and my people were destroyed for their kindness. I won&#39;t stand by and watch it continue. <strong>I WON&#39;T!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I have no right to tell you to shut up.  </p>

<p>Forcing someone to do something with speech or violence is not free speech. It is abuse. If you follow me around and you in my face shouting at me 12 hours a day, that is verbal assault. If I call you a fuckface on facebook you can block me. </p>

<p>Hurting someones feelings is free speech unless you are threatening their safety or disrupting the peace. </p>

<p>Threatening them, invading their physical space is not free speech. 
Do you see the difference.  If I call you a shit head for being a vegan, you can block me. If I come to your home with a bullhorn and shout outside your home for 3 hours without a protest permit, that is disrupting the peace.  </p>

<p>If I have a meeting with my friend and we talk about how we love to eat bunnies, you can simple NOT GO TO the meeting. </p>

<p>If I come to your house and tell you to eat bunnies, I am not disrupting the peace.  </p>

<p>Got it? </p>

<p>Do you see the fucking difference? </p>

<p>Antifa runs up to people swears at them, do chants about physical violence and invade people&#39;s body space.  THAT IS THREATENING BEHAVIOR. Watch the video!!  The police step in and disrupt the verbal assaults of the Antifa protestors because what they are doing is illegal. </p>

<p>One Antifa member physically assaulted a older man and injured him. He was arrested and will be prosecuted.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, how many Nazis are there. What is their average age, 89?</p>

<p>Also, what is a Nazi. I have blue eye and I believe some cultures are superior than others. Am I a Nazi?</p>

<p>Actually, based on research and personal experience, I believe that East Asians have higher average IQ than Westerners. So for these reasons and others, I think their culture is superior to western  culture.  Am I a Nazi? Or maybe I am an emperor worshipper flying in my kamikaze plane aimed at the White House. </p>

<p>My son is half Japanese. Even though some American culture is popular in Japan, I am teaching him that Japanese culture is superior to western culture. For example Japanese culture puts more emphasis on caring for weaker members of society like the elde4ly or handicapped. Also I inform him that the income inequality gap in Japan is much much smaller than most other wealthy nations. Finally, Japanese people in a Japan are some of the most conscientious, kind, non-violent people on earth. </p>

<p>Yes, historically, the Japanese Empire exploited other Asian nations and started a war with United States. They lost the war, they had the war brought to doorsteps, they suffered severe fire bombing and the only nuclear attacks in history, I think they learned her lesson. We should listen to their anti-war message. Will Antifa need to stamp out these dangerous idea too?</p>

<p>Maybe you will need a new label for us. What do you think?
So, will my son be a Nazi too? Are you confused? Does that make you angry? If so, why don’t you take that anger go outside and protest against your American government which is invading and fighting wars in several countries around the world. </p>

<p>Yes, it is true, America is a fascist state, but you are too busy fighting imaginary Nazis when you should be fighting the military industrial complex the controls your government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m noticing a trend with you. You build up this straw man in your head, then go on this long ass rant against that straw man thinking you sound really intelligent or something. It makes it pretty impossible  have any normal kind of discussion with you, but I&#39;ll try and help you out a little bit here. </p>

<p>As I said in my post, the only people I have a problem with are those whose entire belief structure is based around doing harm to others, and &quot;forcible removal&quot; definitely fits that bill. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not sure why you seem to think that I can&#39;t be actively working against multiple fascist systems at once. You think I&#39;m not out there protesting the American government the same way that I protest against fascists pricks at the individual level? Congratulations, straw man number two! </p>

<p>To put it pretty plainly, I&#39;ve never met anyone worth knowing whose response was anything other than &quot;fuck Nazis&quot; when talking about them. I&#39;ve met a lot of pricks like you though who will sit there and find all these different ways to try twisting the fascists into the victims, and it&#39;s not a game I like taking part in. Your thinly veiled attempts at protecting a group of people whose sole intention is death and injury to so many other people is disgusting and tells me all I&#39;ll ever need to know about you.</p>

<p>The definition of false flag does not = lying or expressing political beliefs you disagree with.</p>

<p>It means deceiving other by hoisting the flag of an enemy and attacking one&#39;s own soldiers, citizens, ships, planes bases etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Physical violence is always preceded by a campaign of character assassination and dehumanization.</p>

<p>You paint one person and/or part of society as <em>evil</em> and other side sooner or later will come to blows over it.</p>

<p>These antifa will get progressively more aggressive until the other side does a violent pushback. In fact, there&#39;s been news about some antifa cells providing combat training for its affiliates. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to be wrong about it, but I think blood will be spilled.</p>

<p>Will this be contained in time or will it escalate to a civil war?</p>

<p>Nowadays, I never see or hear of &quot;antifa&quot; outside of Reddit. go figure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We certainly have more questions than answers.  I am just telling you based on the details available to me how things went down, but I have no greater information.  Someone scared him with a gun, supposedly the paths were blocked by crowds and cops as they were funneling people in specific directions.  The guy drives his car into another car and a girl ends up on the hood but just takes off.  Immediately several come crashing at the car with bats, so he flees.</p>

<p>Really I think though the question is, &#39;what was his intent?&#39;  I think it&#39;s hard to argue his intent related to anything about murdering anyone as it was painted so heavily in the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Did they show their antifa ID cards?&quot;</p>

<p>Gosh not sure, did George Soros have the budget to get the ID cards laminated and weather proofed.  </p>

<p>I wonder if people wearing black clothes and shouting &quot;Die Nazi scum&quot; are members of Antifa or not.</p>

<p>I wonder if Cernovich and his supporters were wearing their Nazi armbands and Trump hats, because when they start talking about free speech I start to get confused that they are patriots or something like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I have no right to tell you to shut up.  </p>

<p>Forcing someone to do something with speech or violence is not free speech. It is abuse. If you follow me around and you in my face shouting at me 12 hours a day, that is verbal assault. If I call you a fuckface on facebook you can block me. </p>

<p>Hurting someones feelings is free speech unless you are threatening their safety or disrupting the peace. </p>

<p>Threatening them, invading their physical space is not free speech. 
Do you see the difference.  If I call you a shit head for being a vegan, you can block me. If I come to your home with a bullhorn and shout outside your home for 3 hours without a protest permit, that is disrupting the peace.  </p>

<p>If I have a meeting with my friend and we talk about how we love to eat bunnies, you can simple NOT GO TO the meeting. </p>

<p>If I come to your house and tell you to eat bunnies, I am not disrupting the peace.  </p>

<p>Got it? </p>

<p>Do you see the fucking difference? </p>

<p>Antifa runs up to people swears at them, do chants about physical violence and invade people&#39;s body space.  THAT IS THREATENING BEHAVIOR. Watch the video!!  The police step in and disrupt the verbal assaults of the Antifa protestors because what they are doing is illegal. </p>

<p>One Antifa member physically assaulted a older man and injured him. He was arrested and will be prosecuted.  </p>
