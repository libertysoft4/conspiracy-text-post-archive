<p>Wanted to say this and have thought this way for a long time.. what if you’re both right? What if say, rockets can’t function in a vacuum, which there is some evidence for, can zero point energy? Perhaps we’re just stuck on rockets when in reality, TPTB have had their own UFOs for a century.. </p>

<p>Also, consider the possibility that <em>all is mind</em> and that our minds themselves <em>decide</em> what the shape of the Earth is. </p>

<p>I think the flat earth people were onto some things, but got stuck on the idea that the earth had to be flat. </p>

<p>No, I think the Earth is <em>magic</em> </p>

<p>We just can’t see that yet</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a flat farther, just thought I should say that up front...</p>

<p>I was having a conversation in another thread that mentioned flat earth where we were talking about the idea that the &#39;flat&#39; Earth could be an infinitely flat plane (or at least a very large one). &#39;Aliens&#39; could be from an enclave that is faraway from our enclave (beyond the ice barrier of the pole or whatever they call it). Like a big board with lots of holes drilled in it..each hole would be a different &#39;Earth&#39;.</p>

<p>This is just in response to the idea that people get stuck on certain ideas.</p>

<p>Also, I like your name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m of the same mindset. I mean I’ve had some psychedic experiences that basically showed me the “fractal reality” </p>

<p>I mean everything is one, all within one little atom you find repeating patterns. </p>

<p>I like this idea^ because it really does open up a whole lot of possibilities. It also makes sense that TPTB would want us to focus on the stars when really we could potentially <em>walk to other worlds</em></p>

<p>As a sci-fi nerd, it’s a hard pill to swallow, but I haven’t been to space so I leave all options of it on the table.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hubby and I chat about the infinite plane theory a lot. We also smoke a lot of weed, but I digress.</p>

<p>I’m one of our more interesting convos I pondered how anyone would really know what happened in the past if no one on earth is more than 125 years old. Sure there’s oral history, but there is no way to really know that we aren’t just on some infinite plane of reality that’s constantly being updated to provide citizens with whatever history they want you to “know”. Maybe there is no history and the stuff we are told about the “past” is just to make us afraid and to foster fear through control. I dunno. We think a lot of weird shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That vacuum is way too small.  You will notice there was no movement at first but once the vacuum filled up and no longer was a vacuum it started to move.  That&#39;s who Mythbusters and all the deceivers are pulling one over on people.  Cody&#39;s lab even left water at the bottom of theirs which boils in a vacuum (and therefore makes it not a vacuum).</p>

<p>Every action has an equal but opposite reaction still need something to work on.  It&#39;s true in reality but not in the made up land of &quot;outer space&quot; which is suppose to be a gigantic vacuum (which is also adjacent to our non vacuum atmosphere which is also absurd).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i&#39;ve played around with this model too - that reality is the collective sum of everyone&#39;s perception.  it&#39;s a scary model, and it&#39;s not the only one that&#39;s like this.  regardless of model people know how they&#39;d like to be treated and you can, by thinking from first principles, figure out the principles of balance that would make life as tolerable as it can be regardless of model.  in other words, regardless of model, our optimal arrangement is the same.  and we don&#39;t dialogue on this kinda thing much and get caught up in the minutae.  which is weird, really.  you&#39;d think we&#39;d have a larger frame of reference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Space is space.</p>

<p>Thermodynamics says heat flows to colder areas regardless of dimension as a means of balance. Space isnt a perfect vacuum being devoid of any particulates or without its own principle governing aspects; electromagnetic, gravity, thermodynamics among other variables dictating the state of space between masses and higher concentrations of those governing principles. Density of matter has a profound, limiting or made possible, effect on efforts an acting function may have when interacting with its immediate environment.</p>
