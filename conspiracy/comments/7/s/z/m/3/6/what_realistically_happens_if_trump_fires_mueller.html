    <div class="md"><p>Unlikely.    But it could happen and if it does,  this country would be so close to civil war,   that &quot;to restore order&quot; in &quot;a time of Russian threats&quot;   the military could intervene,  and either eliminate or elevate Trump to interim dictator as we have seen as &quot;temporary measures&quot; in other &quot;democracies&quot;.</p>

<p>Or Trump himself could try to dissolve Congress at least temporarily on the rationale that they are incapable of functioning,  which is unfortunately,  the case,  all they can do is rubber stamp the occassional steamrollered corporate agenda,  as in tax cuts,  or in military increases,  or giving FISA and NSA powers.     If Trump temporarily dissolved congress and demanded the blessing of the supreme court to schedule new elections,  then Trump would also probably revoke the operating licenses of the FAKE news,   and begin daily briefings directly out of his administration for direct public consumption.    Trump does not have the mayors on his side, be he seems to have the governors on his side.    Does Trump have the county sheriffs on his side,  probably,   and the state troopers and the national guard.</p>

<p>I always imagined Trump as a dictator,    but then whats been going on for many decades has also been a dictatorship,  just a more farcical one that should have been enough to wake the people up.   They didn&#39;t vote for Jill,   they said yes to the two party dictatorship,  and this is the natural conclusion to that. </p>

<p>nothing.</p>

<p>nixon resigned. trump won&#39;t resign. </p>

<p>clinton was impeached by a republican house. the current house republicans have tipped their hats that they&#39;ll stick with trump over muellar. </p>

<p>iran contra? millions of dollars spent to die an ignoble death on the alter of ollie north&#39;s poor memory. servers in the closet? millions of dollars spent to be disembowled by the FBI&#39;s red pen. torture? black sites? rendition? have a pardon scooter. lying to congress about spying on americans? get a raise brennan.</p>

<p>consequences for little people.</p>

<p>little people who aren&#39;t cops.</p>

<p>heck, it might even help trump get reelected. adding fuel to a dumpster fire doesn&#39;t kill it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, you can downvote, but it&#39;s true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the late afternoon of August 7, 1974, Senators Goldwater and Scott and Representative Rhodes met with Nixon in the Oval Office and told him that his support in Congress had all but disappeared. Rhodes told Nixon that he would face certain impeachment when the articles came up for vote in the full House. Goldwater and Scott told the president that there were not only enough votes in the Senate to convict him, but that no more than 15 or so Senators were willing to vote for acquittal – far fewer than the 34 he needed to avoid removal from office.[106][107] They did not pressure Nixon to resign, but simply made the realities of the situation clear. Goldwater later wrote that as a result of the meeting, Nixon &quot;knew beyond any doubt that one way or another his presidency was finished.&quot;[108]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Immediately you would see a massive public protest - that day or the next day. The senate would almost immediately re-appoint him. You would likely also see massive leaks even more so than we already have. You might see any sealed indictments unsealed. The government would grind to a halt. The DOW and S&amp;P would have a big week drop. Trump would find it difficult to fill the replacement for sessions that he wants (cause this theory means he needs to fire sessions, rosenstein and potentially one or two more senior DOJ officials). If the house has Trump&#39;s back he may survive but it would be an avalanche of blue in the midterms. And Trump would be impeached and removed in February of 2019... assuming he hasn&#39;t resigned or died by then. </p>
