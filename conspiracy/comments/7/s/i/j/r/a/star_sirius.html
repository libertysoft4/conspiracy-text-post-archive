    <div class="md"><p>Our sun is the junior partner to Sirius (A).  Our sun (Sol) and Sirius orbit each other.  We are currently about as far away as possible from Sirius (apogee) but basically just turned the corner to start coming closer.</p>

<p>The star is just the star, it represents a mass of energy.</p>

<p>I believe it is important to Freemasonry as they worship/celebrate Lucifer, Lightbringer.  Sirius (A) is possibly Lightbringer, as humanity experiences many boons the closer we are to Sirius.</p>

<p>If not, Sirius exerts a ton of influence on humans, so that may also be why they worship it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, and our sun has a Sirius B equivalent somewhere out there.  Both binary systems that... ?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what the space lingo is.  Our sun and Sirius A have: </p>

<p>an orbital relationship?
paired orbits?
random orbits that happen to transect?
a cosmic relationship independent of orbits?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s the proximity to the galactic center that&#39;s the issue -- Sol and Sirius A orbit Sirius B as it orbits the Milky Way galaxy -- and not the proximity to Sirius (A or B), per se.

    <div class="md"><p>I think I follow.  The Golden Age of Man and all that doesn&#39;t trigger due to Sirius, per se, it triggers by being closer to the galactic core... and Sirius just happens to mirror our approach to the core.

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, maybe not.  There is Goddess worship in Masonry, and they likely want to reintroduce a matriarchy (in form more than function).</p>

<p>Goddess worship tho is a subset of Sirius worship, or any star worship.  The Goddess worship began during the Ages of Virgo and Gemini, feminine signs. In theory, the groups that morphed into Freemasons pre-dated those eras (4-7,000 yrs ago).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen him <em>bragging</em> about never been proven wrong. Completely oblivious to the fact that means that he has closed his mind. Of you aren&#39;t realizing you&#39;re wrong about stuff, constantly, you aren&#39;t learning. </p>

<p>Dude is like a walking, talking example of the Dunning Kruger effect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, that does make some things fit into place. I often get the impression that, in some level, he doesn&#39;t really think a lot of the stuff that he spouts it true, and yet he is fully incapable of ever conceding a point, not matter how robustly it is demonstrated that he is wrong. Narcissism puts that into perfect context; a narcissist will go to any lengths in order to preserve their false front. His is entirely based upon being the smartest, best informed, most right skeptic/truth seeker. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the antisocial personality disorder comes into play as well... he cannot even pretend to be nice to make his point. He just cannot help but be condescending and confrontational. </p>

<p>The best thing is, he is so narcissistic that he cannot bring himself to post other peoples content. Like say you wanted to promote something and wanted to be inconspicuous? Say you were flagged for such behavior... well you could engage in the forum and post other peoples links and work the stuff you were shilling into those posts... but he can&#39;t even bring himself to do that, he can only post his own stuff because he things his stuff is the only stuff worth anything. </p>

<p>Its really sad and amazing at the same time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like he got in trouble for shilling his own paid site and YouTube channel. He tried to post them directly and got no upvotes. So he started to post them all over the sub even in unrelated threads. This caught people’s attention and seems like he was told to stop. He now resorts to this approach. </p>

<p>He is likely John le Bonn and he is trybig to get you the subscribe to his channel and pay him $20+/mo for his subscription only website. Arguing with him is inane because he lives goal posts, requires impossible levels of proof, ignores the other persons points and zeroes in on one tiny part of the argument. In his youthbe video comments he doesn’t argue with knowledgeable posters but feuds with those he thinks will have trouble arguing back. It’s not clear what he actually believes as his videos are opaque (although he does promise to blow your mind with the paid videos) but he has videos making fun of “conspiritards” (people on this sub) and “normies”.</p>

<p>He is a con artist looking to get your money and is not operating in good faith.</p>

<p>tl;dw: Sirius** is our Sun&#39;s binary star, responsible for our 26,000 year spiral orbit which drags us closer and farther from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Proximity to the galactic core controls not only our rate of physical growth (Earth, Sun, planets, moons, stars are growing) but also our spiritual growth.</p>

<p>** Best I can tell, it&#39;s actually a quaternary system: Sol (our Sun), Sirius A (the bright one), Sirius B (invisible, extremely massive brown dwarf that the others orbit), and Sirius C (small star with 49.9 year cycle).</p>

<p>Some theosophists believe the stars of the pleiades transmit the light of universal Logos to ursa major thence to Sirius and our Sun whence it finally reaches earth. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a belief that the inhabitants of Sirius were blue in color perhaps explaining the blue color of depictions of Hindu avatars. There&#39;s also a possible correlation with the term blue blood. </p>
