    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Well, first things first. This is a dumb song and it sounds terrible. I think it is being rightly panned. That said, some observations:</p>

<p>The TV&#39;s at the beginning are attempting to be relevant with pictures of Weinstein and #MeToo, the women&#39;s march, generic anti-war protests, etc; but they seem to have no bearing on the song other than simply <em>being</em> there, which is interesting.</p>

<p>Next- the imagery of JT picking up the girl near the &quot;elites&quot; also seems shoehorned in. He&#39;s wearing black, they&#39;re wearing white- is he trying to say he&#39;s a rebel against the system? A laughable statement. Even more so in light of the next scene.</p>

<p>When the girl lights the Illuminati Pyramid on fire @1:38...nothing changes. Everyone keeps worshiping it. Destroying the Pyramid made no difference- full control was already had. What was the point in her act of rebellion if it was ultimately pointless? Seems to be sending across tones of pessimistic nihilism and fatalism.</p>

<p>@ 2:30 JT and the girl appear to &quot;wake up&quot; these people in their &quot;halos&quot;...but they don&#39;t wake them up. The people collapse to the ground, dead or unconscious. Either way, nothing good came of JT&#39;s &quot;awakening&quot;, which seems to play into the earlier scene with the Pyramid. These people are already gone- long gone. There is no hope and even being &quot;Freed&quot; from the system involves death.</p>

<p>The last thing I will comment on is the end- when JT says &quot;I have supplies&quot; he points directly at the children. Then the little boy steps up and says to &quot;die already&quot; &quot;just leave&quot; &quot;we&#39;re fine&quot;...so take from that what you want, but it&#39;s fucking weird and seems to play into the pessimistic nihilism, fatalism, and overall darkness of the video. And the lyrics are just shitty. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t (but really I can) believe they gave him the Superbowl this year...this video shows both why he shouldn&#39;t have it and at the same time exactly why he does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo it&#39;s the Pepsi commercial but as a song. The generic fake woke. But I mean it&#39;s a theme with Dave Chapelle coming back, Jim Careys wierd ass interviews Katey perry&#39;s chained to the rhythm...</p>

<p>The song is obviously not good and like you said the video has nothing to do with the song so why?</p>

<p>It feels like shit is coming out in the open and in hindsight it&#39;ll be super obvious but thus cryptic garbage is just annoying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Her only &quot;woke&quot; song, Chained to the Rhythm, is <em>ok</em> as far as catchiness and general sound, imo. But it doesn&#39;t go far enough lyrically, which was the point. It only has the illusion of wokeness, making its listeners feel like they&#39;ve learned something when they haven&#39;t. </p>

<p>I think a better example of an artist using their platform to spread a real message came out just a few months before &quot;Chained&quot;, and that is Macklemores &quot;Drug Dealer&quot; where he not only calls out the opioid epidemic and Big Pharmas hand in it, but <em>names</em> the companies responsible- Purdue, Actavis, etc; It&#39;s got more substance in one lyric than KP&#39;s entire song. Then again, the only reasons Macklemore could do that is because he&#39;s not signed to a label and self-produces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people here are saying that it is &quot;fake woke&quot; which it certainly seems to be.</p>

<p>Got me thinking... Are they manufacturing these &quot;fake woke&quot; songs as partial disclosure to wake people up? We say that they&#39;ve been doing it with alien movies for years, so that when an event actually occurs we&#39;re already partially mentally prepared. Could this be what this type of stuff is but on a different level?</p>

<p>They wouldn&#39;t let JT actually release a song and a video that actually shows him being woke and burning an occult pyramid with occultists worshipping it. It&#39;s too on the nose. Maybe it&#39;s SO on the nose that they just let him do it. Because the more sensationalized that stuff seems the less likely we are to believe it. It simultaneously prepares us for disclosure but makes it also seem completely far fetches at the same time.</p>
