        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My wife is a physician assistant and she was doing a rotation in a rural area of Pennsylvania that doesn’t have a public water supply, so all water is from wells, so it’s not treated with fluoride. </p>

<p>One thing I noticed was the insanely poor condition of the people’s teeth. I saw many people in their mid trendies with most of their teeth missing or badly damaged teeth. </p>

<p>Sure, some of it can be explained by drug use, but not at a level of lack of dental health as I saw there. 
To me this seems like a clear correlation between fluoride and dental health, but I had that belief even before I saw that situation, so I am a bit biased. </p>

<p>Is there not enough evidence to prove/suggest that fluoride is beneficial, or is there some clear research outlining its detriments? </p>

<p>You seem to have a very strong opinion, saying fluoride is poison. Why do you think that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello.</p>

<p>My city (Vancouver, Canada) doesn&#39;t add fluoride to its water.  Population is over a million people. </p>

<p>On the city website it says talk to your dentist if you need more fluoride. </p>

<p>In general our dental health is very good. Nobody with tons of rotting and fallout out teeth that I see in my day to day life. </p>

<p>My main issue with fluoride in water supply is the only stated use is for teeth.  But it&#39;s almost totally useless at that. </p>

<p>For example. Take a drink of water right now. </p>

<p>Now think about how much of that water touched your teeth. </p>

<p>If you took a normal drink it likely only contacted the front teeth and possibly top of the molars a bit. And only for less then a second. </p>

<p>However it&#39;s not enough to do much good.  </p>

<p>At a dentist they keep the fluoride on the teeth for a minute, and they don&#39;t want you to swallow it. </p>

<p>So why do I want to drink a chemical with my water all the time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People say that fluoride is poison because it&#39;s a fact. It isn&#39;t complicated. There are many well-documented instances of people dying from fluoride poisoning. It has been used as rat poison, but is actually more toxic to humans than rats. It is also a cumulative poison, like lead, arsenic, and mercury. This information has been well known for several decades and is readily available from highly credible sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, what you say is the same as saying smoke marijuana while pregnant is bad because of studies on women who smoked (and likely did harder drugs too). I&#39;m not saying I agree with my example, but insanely poor people are likely to have other insanely bad habits like failure to eat properly, brush, floss, or have regular check-ups. They may not even have tooth brushes or toothpaste. I know Ansel Adams photographed the poor living in the mountains in the USA and their hyguene was pretty bad and death was a part of life.</p>

There is no credible evidence that taking fluoride in water has ever prevented a single dental cavity. The forced-fluoridation fanatics often try to claim that the low rates of dental caries in western European countries which do not have artificially fluoridated public water supplies are due to naturally occurring fluoride in water, or some other kind of artificial fluoridation such as salt fluoridation. They are lying. They also rely on studies which do not measure individual fluoride exposure, are not randomised, are not blinded, are not clinical trials, do not properly account for confounding factors, are highly prone to systematic error, and are typically funded by corporations such as Colgate-Palmolive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What’s more likely, that an entire town has similar brushing habits (or lack of them) or that there is a different reason? If it was one family/community then sure, I could see that as a reasonable explanation, but that’s too many unrelated people. </p>

<p>I’m not trolling, I really am curious about this point of view. </p>
