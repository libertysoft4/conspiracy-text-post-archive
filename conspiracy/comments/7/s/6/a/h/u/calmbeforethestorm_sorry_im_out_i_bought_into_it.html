CBTS is by definition relevant to conspiracy analysis and therefore is fitting and proper to be discussed here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly think Trump has created a reality show of sorts and is playing the villain to an extent.  Q is a perfect example, They&#39;re a mysterious character who drops 1/2 truths or just enough info to keep people latched on.  TCBTS is an underlying theme that can be applied to anything, alsp designed to keep people engaged.  It&#39;s reminiscent (for me) of watching the fan fiction/theories for the show The Leftovers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO trump was put in to get all the conspiracy theorists on his side, only for him to eventually fuck them over somehow. theres nooo way TPTB would put a guy in office for any reason other than their own gain, and if you dont believe the elections are rigged, you just havent done the research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really could go either way imo.  I can see how the establishment and everyone else for that matter, didn&#39;t think Trump was going to win.  When he did, the establishment went on the attack to get Trump fully under their control (which I think they have).  However, you make a great point which was trying to get the conspiracy world to get drawn in by people like Alex Jones and other CT&#39;s, and that could have been for several different reason.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m with you. Trump came out of nowhere and you could tell the system genuinely hated him. I supported him for mainly that reason. after he was elected, he had this flurry of activity trying to fulfill campaign promises.  </p>

<p>Then all of a sudden he bomb Syria with no good rationalization, and ever since then he&#39;s been either floundering on everything or pushing establishment goals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worried.  And to be quite honest with you even as strangers, I was an ardent agnostic until I learned of the validity of all the info regarding ((them)).  I came to a full stop, and I am a passionate Christian again.  I am working on several documents to invigorate those who know these things to come to faith, and to <a href="https://pastebin.com/6nTX0dFa">fight for truth, reason, and freedom</a>. I really do belive it will be impossible to fight the depth of this &quot;evil&quot; without believing in a higher power, whether the higher power exists or not.... and so that does take faith... belief without direct evidence.  The evidence is in the spirit of the people. </p>

Right now though I see a healthy future in America under Trump, as soon as his nay-sayers see through the BS surrounding him presented by the MSM. Seems to me he really cares for his country.

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think it is actually for Trump?  It has the effect of occupying all the minds of the super autistic people who helped comb through the DNC and Podesta emails...  sending them on a rabbit chase and convincing them they are looking for one thing which blinds them from seeing anything else...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude... that is what I was thinking too. I was really caught up in this for a while, but it seems very &quot;anti jewish, anti democrat, anti immigrant&quot;... and while the democratic party def has fucked up recently and I agree with stopping illegal immegration, the fact that nothing negative about trump seems to ever be released and makes him look like some kind of mastermind makes me very skeptical. </p>

<p>It seems like this whole narrative has been thought up and released to the public to get us engaged in this &quot;real life drama&quot;.... cause the last few months have legit felt like we are living in a TV show, like 24 or something, and we get to read what is going on behind the curtain. It just seems too juicy with all this Satanism stuff and 1000+ people indicted, internal coup and all that. Real life has gotten more interesting then the TV dramas and we are living the reality show. </p>

<p>Some of it seems to be coming true tho.... even this &quot;10 days of darkness&quot; was called out before hand right? I really don&#39;t know how this will all end up.... I just hope it won&#39;t end in a biblical flood or Armageddon lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole things just seems really contrived and overly produced.  I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s just for his supporters, I feel like Trump feeds the Trump Hate with his tweet intentionally to pacify the #resist crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, Q being called the new &quot;Deepthroat&quot; and everything, just the way it has all played out before. Its def something new, and almost like getting the people more engaged in the politics from a social media POV. I can&#39;t help but feel like I&#39;m being manipulated by an AI that was designed to stir this stuff up and push a narrative about how &quot;the left was wrong! come join the right side!&quot;. </p>

<p>And as for trumps tweets.... I can&#39;t begin to figure out the point of those, but he def gets people riled up. Plus, aside from the indictments most of his other acts as president I have not seen as positive so I don&#39;t get all this support.... its like this &quot;storm is coming&quot; stuff is a distraction while he approves a bunch of unfavorable stuff instead and people tolerate/ignore it waiting for the payout that might not come. </p>

<p>Totally illogical. </p>

<p>When a movement reaches a critical mass, it inevitably attracts folks to the bandwagon who don’t fit the central message of the movement.</p>

<p>It also attracts agent provocateurs who try to associate the movement with more fringe and extreme thoughts in order to discredit the movement.</p>

<p>The CBTS stream isn’t modded very well and it seems all kinds of tangential ideas make it onto there.</p>

<p>What Gore did was this :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a Senator in the 1980s Gore urged government agencies to consolidate what at the time were several dozen different and unconnected networks into an “Interagency Network.” Working in a bi-partisan manner with officials in Ronald Reagan and George Bush’s administrations, Gore secured the passage of the High Performance Computing and Communications Act in 1991. This “Gore Act” supported the National Research and Education Network (NREN) initiative that became one of the major vehicles for the spread of the Internet beyond the field of computer science.</p>

<p>I also want to say: why is the media <strong>so</strong> <em>against</em> Trump if he is deep state?  I want to make a plea to you, to give it the chances I&#39;m laying out in this comment (above) (and) below.  &quot;deep state&quot;, the illuminati &quot;them&quot;... they are called many names.

<p>Well a lot of us thought that Trump was a &quot;trick&quot; to fool conspiracy communities into endorsing him as a savior of sorts.</p>

<p>The election was rigged, just like all others, but it had more of a convincing &quot;good cop bad cop&quot; narrative with trump and Hillary.</p>

<p>So essentially, Q is being used as the spokesperson or the PR guy for trump to string along conspiracy theorists and get them trusting the government. It&#39;s a very large scale psy op. </p>

<p>There are a hell of a lot of ‘echo-chamber’ subs on Reddit. Tends to happen when like-minded folks want to share/discuss a common interest. Most often than not, the people that go to these subs and accuse them of being ‘fanatical’ or close-minded are just going there to subvert their conversations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The part of this that always eats at my mind is, how long can a calm possibly be, before a storm arrives?</p>

<p>President Trump said this in early October, 2017. Usually a storm is on the horizon when others notice the calm. We are now 3 months out from this comment and no &#39;storm&#39; is materializing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that there has been some turmoil. Whether that counts as part of the storm or not is suspect. Is Saudi and Hollywood two different storms?

    <div class="md"><p>The Saudi shit is for sure a huge deal. It&#39;s cut off the flow of cash from a segment of the royal family that was funding Twitter, Citibank, who knows what other anti-American/&quot;globalist&quot; organizations. </p>

<p>Some of that trickles down to Hollywood, because a lot of these Hollywood actresses (and actors) are whoring themselves to the Saudis for big paydays. You really think Selena Gomez, Kendell Jenner and Gigi Hadid were just &quot;touring&quot; the Middle East two years ago? They made stops in all the kingdoms. Then they get back and Gomez gets $$$ for TV show (glorifying teen suicide btw), Jenner becomes a top model and spokeswoman (for that ridiculous Pepsi ad) and Hadid is atop all the model gossip pages. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just one example among many. </p>

<p>The Saudi coup was a big deal. Haven&#39;t you noticed how little followup there&#39;s been that Osama bin Laden&#39;s brother (and head of bin Laden Group in KSA) and Prince Bandar &quot;Bush&quot; were among the arrests? Why so little coverage of that, do you think?</p>

<p>As for Trump, I think he shot his mouth off when he wasn&#39;t supposed to, so the Generals who are really running things told him to STFU. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a pathetic and transparent attempt to sway public opinion on this sub.</p>

<p>For those interested, I would very strongly suggest you watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa95jLxZfc4">this video</a> if you want to get the basic gestalt on &quot;the storm.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Obama Administration actively spied on Donald Trump during the election/transition using compromised FBI agents to secure a FISA warrant. The FISA warrant is predicated on hearsay (Papadopoulous) and fabricated/unsubstantiated evidenced paid for by Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign and the DNC (Steele Dossier.)</p></li>
<li><p>The FBI Agent Peter Strzok referred to an &quot;insurance policy&quot; in case Donald Trump got elected. In texts to another FBI agent, Lisa Page, he refers to a meeting in Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe&#39;s office where he and McCabe discussed the &quot;insurance policy.&quot; The &quot;insurance policy&quot; they were referring to is probably Mueller&#39;s special counsel.</p></li>
<li><p>In another series of text messages, Page and Strzok discuss that <em>Attorney General Loretta Lynch knew in advance</em> that Comey was going to exonerate Hillary Clinton. Their conversation suggests that this is the reason Loretta Lynch demurred to Comey&#39;s judgment on the case. </p></li>
<li><p>Peter Strzok, was the lead agent on Hillary Clinton&#39;s email case, which was very obviously botched.</p></li>
<li><p>Both Peter Strzok <em>and</em> Lisa page were appointed to Robert Mueller&#39;s special counsel.</p></li>
<li><p>Peter Strzok&#39;s text messages were straight up deleted during the time frame just after the Tarmac meeting with Clinton to when the FBI was appointed a Special Counsel on Russia.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The FBI is currently engaged in an act of sedition against a sitting President of the United States. <em>That&#39;s</em> the storm. With Nunes&#39; memo about to drop I don&#39;t see how you could possibly be &quot;out&quot; when the evidence is stronger than ever that something very, very wrong is happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your sources are both partisan I notice.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s think about this for a second: Devin Nunes and Congress are, according to at least <a href="https://twitter.com/RepDaveJoyce/status/954797154282950657">one congressional source,</a> in the process of releasing the memo. They have already released the memo to the full Congress (including Republicans and Democrats,) which afterwards several Congressmen said the memo was damning and painted a clear picture of corruption at the highest levels of the DoJ/FBI. That right there is enough to make me disbelieve what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>Not just that, but in the past few days we&#39;ve had <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/370027-fbi-unable-to-preserve-certain-text-exchanges-from-agent-removed-from-mueller">breaking news that the FBI &quot;lost&quot; texts from the agent who referred to an &quot;insurance policy&quot; in a meeting with Andrew McCabe</a>. Not only that, but recently released messages that they DO have from Strzok seem to suggest <a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/370019-was-lynch-coordinating-with-comey-in-the-clinton-investigation">Loretta Lynch knew in advance</a> that James Comey was going to exonerate Clinton for the email scandal. I don&#39;t know about you (actually yes I do,) but, to me, we have more and more evidence piling up that there was some very serious corruption happening - and still happening - over at the FBI.</p>

<p>The weakness in your argument is that it all rests on the assumption that this corruption is just a big &quot;nothingburger,&quot; a distraction from the Special Counsel by Nunes. It doesn&#39;t hold up to even the most basic scrutiny, in part because Nunes is doing everything in his power to make sure this memo gets released and also because <em>based on what is public knowledge already</em> there is some pretty damning evidence of corruption at the highest levels of the FBI/DOJ.</p>

<p>We <em>already</em> know they spied on Trump <em>during the election.</em></p>

<p>We <em>already</em> have very strong evidence that they intentionally botched the Clinton investigation</p>

<p>We <em>already</em> know that the same corrupt agents that were responsible for the Clinton investigation&#39;s outcome were deeply involved in the Trump/Russia narrative that led to the FISA warrant that was used to spy on Trump <em>and also to get the Special Counsel.</em></p>

<p>My question to you is, just how much smoke does there need to be before you will admit to yourself that there&#39;s fire?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With all due respect, your article is from almost a year ago, and only cites anonymous sources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After a review of the same intelligence reports brought to light by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers and aides have so far found no evidence that Obama administration officials did anything unusual or illegal, multiple sources in both parties tell CNN.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;So far&quot; being the operating phrase in that sentence. Keep in mind that Nunes and the House Intel Committee has access to ALL classified documents - not just any &quot;Republican or Democratic lawmaker&quot; can go and review his work. </p>

<p>That all changed when he released his memo.</p>

<p>Not only that, new evidence (see my sources above) has come to light since....April of last year.</p>

<p>Seems to me like you&#39;re being dishonest and intentionally misleading people. Saying &quot;republicans themselves debunked&quot; this stuff isn&#39;t even in line with the article from almost a year ago you posted, and certainly isn&#39;t in line with the current state of this investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never bought into the whole thing but I did think it was possible he was referring to the battle against his political enemies.  The Mueller investigation, Democrats, ex-Obama ‘deep state’ appointees inside intelligence community getting ready to move against him, going for the kill.  And Trump and GOP (and allies) armed with things like this FISA memo, numerous lawsuits regarding illegal surveillance, text messages, general plan to go after FBI and Mueller credibility and take down these ‘deep state’ enemies.  I always sort of took it as a saying like “shits about to get real.”  I don’t have any evidence for that but regardless if he meant it that way, things seem like they’re about to come to a head pretty soon.  </p>

<p>Lol, trying to spread CIA propaganda in r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>And then it was admitted that multiple members of his team were being spied upon, including Manafort who was in Trump tower, and including conversations with Trump himself.

<p>It was made up by a British spy, Christopher Steele, because the British Empire is the major power center of the globalists and Hillary was their preferred candidate. The memo was actually sold to Marco Rubio&#39;s campaign before Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign, so your attempts to make this into a partisan issue are a fail.</p>

<p>Implying that anything Trump did or did not do in 2016 would change what Hillary Clinton is proven to have done several years prior. Do you understand how logic works?</p>

<p>And the answer for why is because there&#39;s a conspiracy against Trump, and not that Manafort is actually a foreign agent?? I think reasonable people have come to reasonable conclusions here.</p>

<p>I think that one side is definitely more fact based than the other. I do not hide my disdain for people who still support Trump for moral, intellectual, and societal reason. If you still support Trump, you&#39;re either stupid, misled, or have no moral character.</p>

<p>What I meant by &quot;I wasn&#39;t trying to make it a partisan issue&quot; is that I was just repeating the Republican talking point that they&#39;ve since discarded. Yes, it was inherently partisan, but I didn&#39;t make it that way by repeating their talking point in an effort you show you how their story has evolved in the past year.</p>

<p>It must be some crazy forethought is the FISA courts knew in 2014 that he was going to be a member of the non-extant Trump campaign a year before he announced and two years before Manafort was involved.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t tap the Trump campaign, that implies they were purposefully targeting it. They tapped Manafort because he&#39;s been a Russian shill for more than a decade and was working for Yanukovych/Russia in Ukraine. Then they renewed it when it looked like he was doing the same dirt in America this time.</p>

<p>From the source you linked: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI interest deepened last fall because of intercepted communications between Manafort and suspected Russian operatives, and among the Russians themselves, that reignited their interest in Manafort.</p>

Getting people to talk is the key, also while taking out MS-13. It will take a while for major events to go down as this has been happening for a long time. The key thing is understanding the patriots in the government and military are getting on board, and now with Trump there can be moves. Bush, Clinton, Obama were controlled, and part of it. Although Obama was a mere puppet, Bush and Clinton were involved in the drugs, money laundering, corruption at the highest levels. It will be exposed to the larger audience soon. That being said the globalist have been so used to having controlled populations who are asleep, now the great awakening is happening. We don&#39;t want to destroy the country in the process so it has to go slowly. Can you imagine if the media started talking about Trump taking out his political opposition? It would demoralize the nation, so a lot of this will be done through military tribunals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When reality isn&#39;t confirming your opinions and worldview, you seek out fantasy to fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>Think of it this way, the Trump base eats this &quot;Q&quot; shit up. Much of that base is also a major consumer of fake news. When Trump actually became president, a dilemma came about: how do you continue to believe in your bizarro world fantasies about Jews running the world, shadowy government entities and ultra corruption evil omni-present borderline totalitarian state..... While also being a diehard supporter of Donald Trump... Who runs the state alongside his like-minded republicans? </p>

<p>I mean think about it. Trump and the GOP have virtually every aspect of the US government in their pocket right now: the Congress, the Judiciary, the WH, a majority of state and local governments. They own the ENTIRE franchise. </p>

<p>They ARE, literally, the whole goddamn government from the bottom to the top.</p>

<p>Solution: make up a series of ever-confusing bizarro realities where the strings are being controlled NOT by the people in charge, but by a convenient group of un-elected democrats like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and others who weild power from behind the scenes using some unknown source of leverage or political capital, despite not having any actual office or control. They are the ones to blame for all the chaos, mismanagement and disorder. Not the republicans! The republicans and Trump are doing all the <strong>good</strong> things. All the bad things are the democrats fault.</p>

<p>It&#39;s such hilariously bad logic you&#39;d think a 6 yr old child created it. Yet, there it is. And the republicans absolutely love it. They reproduce it. They engorge on it. It&#39;s absolutely amazing. Like watching a cult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a general rule, any conspiracy related material that adopts the &#39;guys just you wait&#39; narrative is bullshit. Nothing is &#39;just around the corner&#39;, it is obvious pandering to hopefulness in change of the status quo. It is textbook manipulation of the feelings we all have of being fed up with how things are. Campaigns like that are there to foster short term support for these sources and, more importantly, to encourage arguments between ourselves as to the legitimacy of such things.</p>

<p>Either information will be released, or it won&#39;t.  Events will transpire, or they won&#39;t. No amount of watching for the bus to come around the corner will make it appear any faster. We need to hold ourselves to a higher standard. It is OK to be interested in sources like qanon and David Wilcock, but their credibility must be rooted in actual disclosures or information releases, not the perpetual promise of such things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the storm is materializing... Trump made that statement with generals behind him - many took it to mean something domestic, but I happen to believe he was thinking geopolitically. Saudi&#39;s House of Cards like-shift towards MBS, American&#39;s re-upping of support for Zionism with Jerusalem, and the Project Cassandra story and covert-support for rightist elements in the recent Iran protests are pretty significant. </p>

<p>Certain liberal elements of the Deep State might not like Trump and may seek to undermine his authority, but Trump gets along well with the neocons, it appears. </p>

<ol>
<li>Q is a real insider, the real deal</li>
<li>But that doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t have an agenda, aka here to stir up a fanatic Trump following, or distract for any of the administrations&#39; criticisms (for instance continued international war mongering).  Therefore it&#39;s hard to say what information might be altered for sake of Q&#39;s agenda.</li>
<li>But regardless of whether Q has a very strong right-side agenda propagandist or not - if his team is here to take down the Deep State and Cabal then I&#39;m all for it.  I&#39;d say better these guys win than the DNC mafia.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>There is still no proof of mass arrests. Not only that CBTS is conducting a pro Trump meme war. Why isn&#39;t it an anti Pedo meme war? Simple answer, it&#39;s a distraction from the real truth movement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the real truth?  what is that, exactly? 1) nobody said there have been mass arrests, despite people making it no secret that it&#39;s what they hope has/will happen.  2) It&#39;s not surprising that people would be pro-trump in a subreddit that discusses a happening that would definitely <strong>not be happening</strong> had he not been elected, and 3) i&#39;ve seen plenty of pizzagate stuff thrown around on cbts, but had Q focused on elite pedophilia over documented political corruption as a way to start waking the masses, I imagine public response would have been far less predictable/chaotic and they made it clear that they didn&#39;t want to raze society to rubble in their process of waking ppl up and bringing about meaningful changes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well from what i can tell, the topics being discussed in here are very much in line with what your guy Mark Passio spends 9+ hrs discussing in his &quot;What on Earth is Happening&quot; video, with the addition of hope that something&#39;s being done about at least some of it. If the CBTS is &#39;headcanon&#39;, but Mark Passio is enlightened and somehow superior, then i think you may need to rewatch Mark or re-read CBTS and maybe reevaluate.  Just because this Qvolution doesn&#39;t seek to press the reset button on civilization and eliminate all the evils of modern society by razing it all to rubble, it doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not a step in a better direction for the millions of people suddenly realizing that the world&#39;s a huge lie.</p>
