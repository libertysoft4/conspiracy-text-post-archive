    <div class="md"><p>Well, Media Matters already publicly admitted to manipulating social media through Correct the Record. Then we had supposed leaked documents detailing ShareBlue as a spiritual successor to Correct the Record, with a new goal of removing Trump either through impeachment or at the voting booths in 2020. Throughout 2017 I have seen unusual account activity and apparent vote manipulation which appears to be consistent with that goal, and the techniques resemble those used by Correct the Record in 2016.  </p>

<p>As I already said, I can&#39;t prove this gut instinct, I am merely explaining what I believe to be true based on the reasons above and my own experience here and in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> during the election. I&#39;m certain I&#39;m not the only one who feels this way, so I voiced my opinion to add balance to an extremely slanted thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice strawman. I was pointing out that the deep state is anti-trump, at least concerning to create division between your only two parties. So thanks for missing the point completely. Also, if you think the deep state cycles between whichever party is in power at the moment you are simply delusional. These aren&#39;t Republicans OR democrats. These are the richest people in the world who control everything, why the fuck would they be partisan?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shareblue whistle blower describes how they posted on reddit:</p>

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@rebelskum/disinformation-warriors-part-iii-shareblue-insider-targeted-anti-msm-posts-on-reddit-4chan-and-more">https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@rebelskum/disinformation-warriors-part-iii-shareblue-insider-targeted-anti-msm-posts-on-reddit-4chan-and-more</a></p>

<p>&quot;The insider was hired in February 2017 to make posts on Reddit, Twitter and 4chan as well as prepare responses for ShareBlue social media bots at an average rate of 2 cents per post. According to the insider, mostly individuals from India, China and Thailand are recruited to ShareBlue even though they directly intervene in U.S. politics.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no proof in that blog you just linked. You understand that right?</p>

<p>All it says is he has some anonymous source that says they worked for Shareblue. Could just be the author made that up himself. Why is it you take this guys word for it with no questions, but are a skeptic when it disagrees with you?</p>

<p>Oh and even if we take your link as the truth, it in no way shows that Shareblue is more active or has a larger budget than Cambridge Analytica. In fact, in the article it even says that the anonymous source had the opportunity to post for Trump as well. </p>

<p>Maybe Shareblue pays better? LOL. </p>

<p>Because every post or comment I make gets brigaded by Shareblue employees. You keep denying what everyone here experiences and citing irrelevant, general claims about Cambridge Analytica that no one is disagreeing with. As if proving that Cambridge Analytica were also here would disprove the Shareblue shills that we all see every single day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay.</p>

<p>I know you are not a shill? Do you believe the same for me?</p>

<p>Why is it that your downvoted comment had to be because of shills? Why is it impossible that many disagree with you and how you go about yourself on this subreddit? I certainly disagree, does that mean I am a shill?</p>

<p>You claim everyone on this sub has the same experiences as you and believes the same things you do. Why?</p>

<p>I would be much less likely to downvote and be hostile towards you if you didn&#39;t dismiss any thought or opinions other than your own as shills. Could that not be the reason you are downvoted? </p>

<p>In my time here, I have never seen you question a right wing narrative. That makes me question your motivations, and makes me more likely to dismiss your comments. I&#39;m sure you would agree if the shoe was on the other foot. </p>

<p>You hadn&#39;t been on reddit for 2 months before your spree today, you use all the talking points, and deny known facts. So, no, there is no evidence that would lead me to believe that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I&#39;ve been on reddit. </p>

<p>Just not this account. And I hardly think account age and posting frequency matter when it comes to who is a shill. Why would a shill have this conversation with you? To be honest dude, you seem kinda paranoid. </p>

<p>And I haven&#39;t read your post history. I have just seen you around here. Always downvoted, and always defending right wings narratives in the face of mounting evidence. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re claiming to be an old user, but weren&#39;t around for the CTR influx?</p>

<p>&quot;Why would people whose job it is to argue with people on the internet argue with you on the internet?&quot;</p>

<p>Deflecting, general forum disruption, infuriation.</p>

<p>I have 10,000 karma and you have 200. And I don&#39;t have bots. More infuriation tactics.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Divide and conquer on partisan lines, infuriation (attack people who aren&#39;t partisan to try to get them riled up to waste more time on you).</p>

<p>You&#39;re not nearly as clever as you think. Blocked and reported.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, to be honest I started browsing r/conspiracy 6 months ago. Not exactly a old user.</p>

<p>And isn&#39;t the point of a shill to reach a lot of people? Not keep replying in a deep thread on a post with 47 upvotes on a minor sub?</p>

<p>You are paranoid dude. All your comment mention shills. </p>

<p>TBH, I&#39;m surprised this account has 200 karma.</p>

<p>Okay? I&#39;m not going to get banned. I haven&#39;t done anything. But it&#39;s clear you are freaking out. That, or you realize you don&#39;t have a leg to stand on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a small minority of conspiracy people that do their own research and look for evidence. Those also happen to be the people most likely to join someplace like r/conspiracy at the ground floor.</p>

<p>Conspiracy veterans want to hear about things like the conspiracy to create the Federal Reserve or the British Empire&#39;s involvement in the US Civil War, because you have to understand the past to understand the present. </p>

<p>The new people just want to hear about the latest political happening, and will even attack anything older than a month or two because it&#39;s not happening. Happenings give more of a dopamine hit, but they&#39;re less likely to be important in the grand scheme of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like a lot of people are building straw men to disparage the conspiracy community. Saying a lot of these things go no deeper than 4chan or twitter is a misleading statement. Twitter users can post videos, articles, infographs, self report, etc. 4chan has users participating there that may not come to this forum. An occasional glance at an interesting conversation over there should always be welcome. If you don&#39;t agree with it, downvote and move along. I&#39;m seeing a huge increase in the amount of concern trolling lately, though I admit, this may be because of Rule 13 drying up the amount of posts, and making self posts more visible.</p>
