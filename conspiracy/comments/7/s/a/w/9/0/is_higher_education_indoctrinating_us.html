<p>Anything STEM related is OK.</p>

<p>As for business school, accounting and information systems are typically the most &quot;scientific&quot; imo. Accounting is just math with a specific ruleset. Information systems, depending on the university, can range anywhere from a generic IT program to computer science in business school.</p>

<p>Not sure how your econ degree is, but if its econ related to social and behavioral sciences, yeah you will get a lot of propaganda and social science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on the period and event. For instance- Cicero&#39;s personal letters to Atticus. There is a known manuscript tradition, though thin, and there are historical references in the middle ages to knowledge of their existence at some point in the 9th century, then Petrarch (re)discovered them in the 14th century in a monastery in Verona. Manuscript traditions are traced via &quot;hands&quot; or the distinctive writing style for different times and periods. With several manuscripts one can trace the line of copying to an extent.</p>

<p>I use Cicero&#39;s letters as an example because before they were widely studied there was great ignorance about the later years of his life, and the politics surrounding the late Roman Republic. Cicero&#39;s philosophical works had been widely read in the Middle Ages, especially book 6 of his De Republica- The Dream of Scipio. They painted a far from complete picture. The letters humanized him, showing his flaws, faults, and contradictions in his own personal philosophy. And it gives great detail into the final years of the Republic before Cicero&#39;s execution, as well as a philosophical explanation of how Cicero saw the Republic. </p>

<p>Other periods are far dryer, especially (sticking with Rome here) sources for the Crisis of the Third Century. But you would be surprised how much info the Primary sources do give, especially about Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>Thanks for this reply.</p>

<p>So even if we take this story on face value, Cicero&#39;s letter could easily have been forged 1,000 years after his 9alleged) existence, could it not?</p>

<p>And even if we assume the letter is not a forgery, how do we <strong>know</strong> it is from the 9th century?</p>

<p>Once we understand how easily &#39;history&#39; can be faked, why would we continue to take &#39;ancient history&#39; on face value?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not based on the Latin of the day. Cicero&#39;s letters became <em>the</em> standard. Even learned Latin had declined sharply into a more vulgar form just a couple of centuries after the collapse of the West. When Petrarch rediscovered them they set the standard for Latin education for 4 centuries, and today are still considered the height of Latin prose writing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And even if we assume the letter is not a forgery, how do we know it is from the 9th century?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dating of most manuscripts is done based on their handwriting. Distinct regions at specific times had different styles of approved &quot;handwriting&quot; that the manuscripts, secular or spiritual, were written in. Primary sources from their own time as well as from the end of the Manuscript era and the invention of the printing press help to track this tradition as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once we understand how easily &#39;history&#39; can be faked, why would we continue to take &#39;ancient history&#39; on face value?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because there is a point where you can trust certain Primary sources, based on tracing manuscript traditions and locations, reference from other Primary works, and archaeology that confirms what Primary sources say. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Now here we agree. It&#39;s a terrifying thought. I try to introduce people to the 32 second collapse reel of building 7 if they are open minded enough but still caught within the official narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Universities are making a ton of $ off of international student enrollment. In fact, I would say international student enrollment makes more $ for schools than domestic students, because they have to pay higher tuition as they are out-of-state.</p>

<p>The culture of universities has shifted to appease these students because they want their $</p>

<p>That&#39;s honestly a big part of it. I currently work for a university and we&#39;re actually hurting bad now because international student enrollment is dipping due to H1B visa changes</p>

Every teacher and administration I&#39;ve spoken with acts burnt out and is only in it for the money. Education in the west is bloated and corrupt and while I can&#39;t completely change it, I can try so that others might still have the chance to one day.

<p>I remember viewing <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a>, sometime ago, and I shit you not... someone posted a picture of a &quot;designated crying station&quot; at their university. I laughed so hard, then I checked the comments, and people were actually defending them and saying they were actually a good thing. </p>

<p>My laughter then turned to disbelief, that is how far gone society actually is. <em>smh...</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Asia, maybe. In the USSR, many writers chose to go against the USSR&#39;s political views, and were thus considered rebels and undesirables. Primarily due to propaganda, the number of persecuted artists was inflated to &#39;all of them&#39;, instead of just the ones who, for whatever idiotic reason, chose to defy the government AND stay in the country they were actively ridiculing. A good parallel would be if Edward Snowden had stayed in the US after his leaks.
Also, not entirely certain why you ridicule communism as a system for &#39;taking from others&#39;, when capitalism fits that definition much more closely. For communism to be created, yes, things must be taken, but capitalism encourages continually taking as much as possible for yourself.</p>

<p>About the significantly less than product is worth, the profit margins make it that way. There is a certain amount that they have to make in order to make enough. You have a choice to not buy those products. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And how does it encourage that innovation? With cash prizes. Capitalism encourages hiring workers to work for you, selling the product they make, then paying them significantly less than the product is worth. For an extreme example, look at the child labor factories in places like Asia. They make consumer goods worth $1000, but they get paid below US minimum wage, while whoever runs the company that employs them gets rich. For a less extreme example, consider yourself. How much do you make in a year? Now how much does your boss make in a year? Does he really do that much more work than you?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have a boss, then this won&#39;t apply to you, and I doubt I&#39;ll be able to sway you, because the people who receive the benefits from a system are always the main proponents of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is forcing those workers to work, especially in America.  Places like China have many problems that lead to poor work conditions, but the sole reason isn&#39;t just  capitalism.  </p>

<p>Yes, my boss makes more money than me, and deservedly so;  he has more responsibilities and makes more important decisions that will directly affect the company than I do on a daily basis.  Does this mean I blame capitalism for my shortcomings?  HELL no.  This is America, I can be in his/her position if I worked for it.  </p>

<p>Capitalism encourages innovation because it forces companies to adapt and &quot;one up&quot; one another.  This also leads to a healthy competitive market, which leads to lower prices for consumers, ie you and I.  And why do they want to one up each other?  Of course many do it for the passion in their work, but you better believe a LARGE majority of innovators and inventors are chasing a
dollar symbol.  And that is because money grants us freedom, and really, that is all we want at the end of the day.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t get me wrong, capitalism can also promote corruption, in that, it can be easy to take advantage of it if you have the right political power. But again, that is a systematic problem, not a capitalism problem.  </p>

<p>Not really true. We like to imagine that we live in a meritocracy, but we really don&#39;t. Everyone is not afforded equal opportunity. A person born into a family with $10 million has a hell of an advantage over a person born into a family with $10.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t graduate that long ago - maybe 3 years - most people at universities are socially liberal and tend to be left/democratic.  But I think this is the nature of the beast.  Of course faculty is going to support the side that supports funding for higher education and NSF/NIH/NEA/NEH funding for research.  It is also a place that has people from all over the world with all sorts of beliefs, so there is a tendency to be more tolerant/openminded.  Just as a side point, I&#39;d also like to say that anecdotally, I know two people who were raised to believe homosexuality was a terrible sin.  Then they went to college and met actual gay people and how have no problem with it.  </p>

<p>Universities have also become much more left leaning I&#39;d say in the past decade.  The right in the US has become very anti-science/anti-intellectual, which has driven most academics.  I was in the sciences where politics hardly ever comes up.  Even there (as far as people I know) you are going to meet a lot more Ds/lefties due to that.  This trend has been going on at least 10 years: <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2009/07/09/section-4-scientists-politics-and-religion/">http://www.people-press.org/2009/07/09/section-4-scientists-politics-and-religion/</a></p>

<p>In that study, only 6% of scientists identified as republican.  But this trend has nothing to do with &quot;indoctrination&quot;.  It has to do with how the republican party addresses climate change, evolution, and especially NSF/NIH etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s something that becomes apparent as you get older, after leaving education systems, and realize that you&#39;ve learned more valuable, important information <em>out</em> of the education system than <em>within</em> it. </p>

<p>That is, if you&#39;re someone who does research things and continue learning. I think one of the biggest, baddest aspects of modern education is how it teaches people to respect authority and &#39;official&#39; sources in an informational method of consume-regurgitate. 
People think universities and colleges are telling them the truth... 
Science is the worst for this, too. I see people wearing shirts saying &#39;science is real&#39;, as if that was ever debated. It&#39;s like, yeah, sure science <em>is</em> real, but is what you&#39;re looking at <em>real science</em> or is it data manipulated to fit the &#39;scientific consensus&#39; that the agenda has deemed &#39;right&#39; for us to believe? Example: When you talk about vaccines and how bad they are people start quoting &#39;facts&#39; and &#39;statistics&#39; put out by the FDA. Because the FDA haven&#39;t been found repeatedly approving known toxins for use in food and medicines while banning plenty of <em>real</em> medicines and foods... </p>

<p>It&#39;s a terrible situation. People really need to wake up to it all. </p>

<p>Ask the average &#39;science&#39; believer to explain the difference between &#39;science&#39; and the scientific method.</p>

<p>Ask them if they know what an &#39;appeal to authority&#39; is.</p>

<p>Then ask them how much &#39;science&#39; they ave done for themselves.</p>

<p>Then watch their minds go into meltdown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People look up a scientific article, see the headline, or read the analysis and believe it’s true. I mean excluding variables, skewing statistics, there are so many ways to back up your underlying view with results. I remember reading a scientific article about the minimum wage increase in New Jersey and how it actually raised employment, leading people to advocate for a $15 an hour min wage. Meanwhile, it was only something close to 50 cent increase which wouldn’t actually show the impact of a significant raise in wage.</p>

<p>Only if it fits with their preexisting worldview.</p>

<p>People google and then cherry-pick the &#39;science&#39; which seems to support their belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry about them... worry about the Neo-Keynsianism they are filling your head with.

That is truly deceptive to frame Keynsian economics in a feasible way, while the underlying assumption is econ is generally factual and verified.
I have been fed so much Keynes it is absurd</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, it’s brainwashing.</p>

<p>I remember in high school in geology class we were learning about the Big Bang. Some girl in class asked our teacher if he was going to teach us any other theories or just that one, he said he only had the materials and allowance to teach the Big Bang theory. This chick told the teacher it was illegal to misinform a class by telling them there is only one believable theory to the beginning of the world. I have no idea if that was true or not but the teacher looked red in the face and sputtered for 5 min about how other theories exist but not one of them can actually be proven as truth.</p>

<p>Makes me hope there are students like that in universities today. It was weird tho, made me feel lied to</p>

Education is dominated by liberals; in some ways this can be a good thing, in other ways, it&#39;s a very bad thing, because you get the &#39;bad eggs&#39;, the radical feminazis, who try to push their agenda on students as if it were fact.
