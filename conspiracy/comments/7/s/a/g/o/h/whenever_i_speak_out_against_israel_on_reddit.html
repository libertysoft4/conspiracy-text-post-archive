    <div class="md"><p>I wish I remembered. It had some generic name like &quot;Combating the Foes of Israel Online&quot;. It was really fucking blatant. There were sections in it that would go something like this:</p>

<p>WHEN YOU SEE THIS:
Israel influences U.S. elections. </p>

<p>THINK ABOUT THIS: 
Israel has always been a friend of the U.S. and while the government of Israel has no influence in U.S. elections many politicians and citizens of the United States are sympathetic to our cause for freedom and fighting the terrorists of Palestine. </p>

<p>SAY THIS:
Israel does not influence any elections in the United States. The idea that they do is preposterous. Israel is a small country and doesn&#39;t have the power of the United States so it couldn&#39;t even be done. </p>

<p>Israel and the United States have a long-standing friendship and for one country to interfere with the other would be an egregious violation of their trust with one another. Israel is a land surrounded by other Arab countries who would like nothing more than to see them destroyed. The U.S. recognizes this which is why the two countries have such a strong bond. </p>

<p>AVOID THIS:
Don&#39;t give the appearance that you are a citizen of Israel even if you may live in the U.S. and are not. Write your comments so they appear that they are neutral in nature. Don&#39;t engage in name calling but try and hold the higher ground while also inserting statements about how ridiculous the idea is that Israel could influence U.S. politicians. Do not mention the ADL, AIPAC or other organizations which lobby within the U.S. </p>

<p>I mean the whole book (a PDF really) was so fucking in your face I couldn&#39;t believe they had the balls to publish it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to meet some friends for a much needed cocktail shortly but I promise I&#39;ll come back and try to find it. I wish I could remember what particular group put it out. </p>

<p>I ran across it a couple of years ago (<em>probably in this subreddit</em>) and sat there eating carrots or something mindlessly putting them in my mouth without even looking at the bowl because I couldn&#39;t tear my eyes away from the screen.</p>

<p>I know I used the word blatant before but it was really that. It was so fucked up that it was like watching Inception. I was like &quot;this can&#39;t be real... someone had to mock this up. This is like a conspiracy in a conspiracy&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll look again later. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, you should be picketing outrageous &quot;one state&quot; events and
debunking books about the &quot;Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine,&quot; but don&#39;t expect that type of activity to win
many new friends for Israel. At the most, it will limit the damage a bit. Think carefully about why you
are not convinced by the latest anti-Israel book or the university Israel Apartheid Week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I downvoted that thread without commenting, like I do to most of the partisan news articles here. Mainly that, and the fact that the Russian collusion is a psy-op(despite a rather large investigation outside of YouTube and Reddit) covering for trump being pro-Israel (like every other politician and media mogul) makes zero sense. Are you saying he can&#39;t be both? Saying that one cancels out the other? Wouldn&#39;t it make sense for the largely Jewish entertainment and media industry to not create a &quot;psyop&quot; if he&#39;s out there sucking Zionist dick? </p>

<p>I commented that the Rape of Nanjing was as bad, possibly worse, than the Holocaust. I questioned whether the Times would refer to a movie about the Holocaust with terms like “overly patriotic j e w s” or refer to Nazis as”cartoon cutter villains”. I said this review sounds a bit racist. My comment was deleted by the mods.</p>

I&#39;d even support a two state solution to ensure it ends, though I&#39;m sure that would only lead to instability in the future. However, there are actors in Palestine and surrounding countries that have sworn to destroy Israel. Being raised in a Christian household, I i have a certain connection to the Israeli state, and I&#39;m sure others here may as well which would contribute to the OPs idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you feel differently about the situation if the founders of the modern state that is tormenting your co-religionists (who have practised Christianity in the region for thousands of years) had called the country they created in 1948 something different, like &quot;We Are All Equal Land&quot; or &quot;Nation of the Golden Rule&quot;?</p>

<p>With respect, the situation you deplore can only exist as long as people such as yourself feel unable to condemn it because the founders of this modern state happened to give it a name that resonates with your particular holy book.</p>

<p>Far from inspiring practical compassion for your fellow man, it seems to me that you are crossing to the other side of the road in the name of Christ: your faith calls you to do nothing more than wring your hands (or pray, which to me is much the same thing).</p>

<p>Or are you one of these End-Timers that is looking forward to the apocalypse? If so, do you not think that judgement on those who have killed innocents in the name of the Lord will be as terrible as the righteousness that has caused so much slaughter in the Middle East?</p>

<p>I think a genuine Christian would feel particular sympathy for the Christian (Arab) population of Palestine which has brutalised by the Israelis - yet you identify with the Jewish/Zionist oppressors.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got Stockholm Syndrome built on solid base of Christian-Zionism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Bible calls me to be a Zionist. Thats a small bit of my faith, so please don&#39;t judge my religion based on one comment. And that&#39;s the thing- I do sympathize with all of those persecuted in Palestine. But neither side is innocent, there are states that have sworn to destroy Israel. You must realize, the end of the Bible describes a great war against Israel, which I&#39;m sure contributed to the sympathy the American population has for Israel. That doesn&#39;t mean we have to tolerate the bad shit they do. But it does mean that people are naturally ready to defend Israel as the Bible tells them to do. Americas bombed the shit out of more countries than Israel ever could, but that doesn&#39;t make all Americans evil. </p>

<p>Where exactly? If you are a Christian, your faith should be predicated on the New Testament - you know, the book about Jesus Christ. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t Jesus criticise the old teachings of the Jews and create a new religion - Christianity? Why then would Christians pay obeisance to the Old Testament (the Torah) which is explicitly the teachings of the Jews, those who repudiate Christ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All political ideologies have some no life assholes with no job getting paid by some other political zealots to spread propaganda. Even groups you&#39;d consider good. Really every political group there is has people doing this willingly thinking they&#39;re doing God&#39;s work or something since they&#39;re too useless to get a real job and too scared to live in the real world where one political ideology gettibg implemented isn&#39;t going to make them happy.</p>

<p>So yes, probably. You probably won&#39;t get a totally positive response unless you&#39;re in a circle jerk. It&#39;s fairly rare to find non brainwashed people who completely agree with each other on any one thing.</p>

<p>But before you start wondering about bots or paid propagandists, just remember that a lot of people are crazy obsessed with a lot of political shit that the real them doesn&#39;t even care about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the welfare state will have them perpetually vote for the Zionist liberals that hooked them on that juice. Most minority groups are especially easy to tempt, and you wonder why they want to come here? It&#39;s because their governments are corrupt and because low IQ people are suggestible to corruption. America will not make it if its IQ keeps plummeting, it will lose the ability to look out for posterity if she hasn&#39;t already lost it.  </p>

<p>Divide and conquer is destroying borders, not preserving them. Democrats will always be in favor of the welfare state, Republicans you can get them to part on that issue as they see how devastating it is on the family unit. Republicans have their neocons as well but they also have their Ron Pauls, but the issue of welfare is a massive one as these immigrants will always be easy to bribe with the promise of welfare and infinite immigration for the rest of their families back home. </p>

<p>America will not survive if she takes in the world, that is precisely what the cult of Zion now wants to do to Europe. Borders must be enforced, and the time is running out for this.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but it&#39;s just a step in the right direction, we&#39;re not going to get it all at once. In fact demographics already look bad (white children are already a minority in the U.S) and there is trouble looming ahead of the west because the demographics are already baked in and I don&#39;t really advocate for removing people.</p>

<p>Limiting welfare will limit that amount of babies they can produce and cause a lot of self-deportations, so IMO, that would be a major defeat on Zionism as it would loosen their grip on the west and help white demographics a little. The wall is not going to turn the baked demographics around but it&#39;s meant to help a little. </p>

<p>Small victories are still victories and they will dovetail into bigger ones in time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like it was a group of highly intelligent God-fearing men that built this country from scratch. The natives didn&#39;t do it, blacks didn&#39;t do it, hispanics didn&#39;t do it, why do all these groups want to live white governments? In Europe and the U.S? It&#39;s because race, IQ, and the ability to defer gratification matters, and all of that lives within the blood of a people.  </p>

<p>Race matters, race matters so much so, that this is the entire point of destroying borders. The closer different groups come together, the more they tend to resent each other, thus we&#39;re back at discovering why borders formed in the first place.</p>

<p>Why do you think racial tensions have only gotten worse? That&#39;s because the races are, in the end, different, and they prefer different things. It will end in war, just as it did in the past. You know the saying &quot;If you want peace prepare for war&quot;, and borders are enforced by a military. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>here&#39;s a conspiracy theory for you (Disclaimer: I do not endorse this.)</p>

<p>we live in a highly complex simulation. The most important place on a simulated planet with simulated intelligent life, would be the areas that have simulated natural selection and have changed the course of events or otherwise greatly effected the outcome of the simulation. Places where religion first spread. Places where urban societies first developed. If these places exist, if they are real then there in fact would be evidence going further back. Depending on the size and length of the simulation this could be problematic. I want you to think about the name for a second. &quot;Is Real.&quot; Whenever you need a parabolic history lesson, we have a story for you. The first religions talked about gods and the great ether beyond, and people with unimaginable powers. People probably with GM status in the simulation. Or more importantly, a very accurate simulation of early religions which would have guided us towards the truth of this not being reality. Within this simulation Every type of civilization imagineable has a story, (but not all types exist or have existed) even ones which are impractical or counter intuitive have stories. Behavior control is very strict within the simulation, beyond that which can be found in natural environments even because there is definitely none-random moves being made about what goes where at times. What do we call these pre-major religion cities or places? The Earliest cities? Of course, we call them babylon. Because at some point all the possible stories have been said and you&#39;re just talking about one of the same old functions that makes a city unique, with a different name. So you&#39;re babbling on.</p>

<p>Is Real. </p>

<p>You begin to question things. Anytime you bring up the city that says defiantly, this is real. This is base reality, not a simulation, down to it&#39;s very name and nature you will be attacked. It needs this to maintain a relationship with base reality. Regardless of if it is or not, this need to control goes well beyond the bounds of standard amounts of care - even for the fanatical religious or ideological. It enters the realm of certainty of action - the result is that in the world around you, due to their absolute certainty of a goal these &quot;Game Masters&quot; of the simulation as it were, anything that deviates from what they have set in place is negative and to be worked out. To call to question anything truly and openly, no matter how ridiculous or questionable, will cause you to be openly attacked. But how close you get to the core of the issue can be described by how fast a conversation about it moves towards entropy - because to talk about the true nature of things will always damage the simulation&#39;s agenda: which is to simulate data about an unknowing world, like the one it probably came from - or at least an uncertain world. The problem is that uncertainty may have been a result of not knowing, whereas in a simulation you can know some things for sure - to more of a degree of accuracy than would ever be possible in a naturally occuring environment. That behavior is not popping up in the places you think when I first stated it; it&#39;s not a problem when you throw stones, drive cars, write on a napkin or interact with the opposite sex, no. It&#39;s an exploit that is best seen by looking at how people interact with each other. If ever there is anything that is beyond question; you know who your masters are.</p>

<p>I am a-political regarding israel. I don&#39;t ever talk about it. But I have noticed that bringing it up is like a black hole, the gravity of which nothing escapes. Is Real.</p>

<p>If you say this is a simulation and claim that is your real belief, although irrefutable, you will be attacked. If you claim israel is not real, you will likewise be attacked. The degree to which you state it will determine the degree of system resources they put into governing that particular behavior. If you say the Palestinians were there first, which is true, you will be attacked. If you say the jews made up their religion entirely in order to control some part of the world which is offering information against it&#39;s certainty, I would be surprised if such a post, if serious, ever made it to the internet. Again, these are not ideas I endorse they are just fun thought experiments. It&#39;s about Information control and warfare. Who has the best propaganda? If the simulation is real it&#39;s best chance of survival (continue simulating) is if we all forget that this isn&#39;t real and do what the admins say, and let nature other than that take it&#39;s course. Because it&#39;s no longer a science experiment. It was reliable enough that they propped things up on it, even things which have since fallen into each other, and now, regardless of the reality of the situation, it&#39;s the world we live in.  So stop asking. Stop searching. Stop believing otherwise. Is Real.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t. Hate is a strong word and a waste of energy. That word has caused more damage to humanity throughout history than any other. The Israeli government is likely behind all of the astroturfing, whether it&#39;s paying human beings or employing bots that look for phrases and utilize semantic analysis. They&#39;re an intelligence partner too, so...it makes logical sense that they probably get help from &quot;US&quot; as well in keeping their image clean online and stifling dissent. </p>

<p>The Jewish Zionists are actually more reasonable than Christian Zionists who are generally way more dangerous and a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>They&#39;re all pro Israel muppets though.</p>

<p>Israel uses JIDF, megaphone, hasbara to quell online criticism by getting it&#39;s young supporters to play PR clean up for them.</p>

<p>Google the hasbara handbook if you want to see what kind of debate tools they use to win arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israeli society (one of the oldest in humanity)  was the first to minimize the impact of a pantheon of gods.</p>

<p>By going with only one god, they minimized the negative impact of doing stupid things in the name of gods, and gained early advantages over other societies.</p>

<p>They further codified quite a number of natural laws (science), as religious law.  This enabled them to advance in other ways.  </p>

<p>Because of this continued intense focus, they have been able to retain somewhat of an edge over other societies through much of history, even today.</p>

<p>Early banks, for instance, were often owned by Jews, who simply lived by Torah law, and were able to stay above conflicts of their day.</p>
