    <div class="md"><p>Under a homogeneous society maybe. If society is too diverse then it will never agree on anything, surely? I hope I&#39;m wrong, but too many people hold on to ancient grudges. How would we get everybody to agree on what is the right way for us to progress as a species? Do we even need to progress? Who decides what&#39;s right and wrong when everybody unites? A united population sounds great on paper, but it would probably be chaos in theory. I guess it depends who keeps the order.</p>

<p>There is seemingly not enough to go around, and people get desperate.</p>

    <div class="md"><ul>
<li>Allah has ordered us to unite.</li>
</ul>

<p>Allah said: &quot;Hold fast to God’s rope all together; do not split into factions.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Allah would not order us to do something impossible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Allah said &quot;We do not burden any human being with more than he is well able to bear&quot;. </p>

<p>Also, Allah is Just and he does not order a person to do something impossible. If a tyrant orders a 5 year old to life a 1000 kg rock, that would be both cruel and absurd. Allah is Just and Merciful.</p>

<p>Therefore, unity is possible and achievable and it is obligatory on every Muslim to pursue it. Those who do not try to achieve unity are disobeying Allah.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The current replies in this post are lacking in imagination, and is also grounded in negativity.</p>

<p>Much like the current state of this sub.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll bite briefly anyway.</p>

<p>Perhaps if we could somehow end our division and unite humanity, progress in technology and spiritual advancement (some will cry that this is woo woo) will increase at an incredible rate.</p>

<p>As the negativity left over from this division, stemming from scarcity and overall bad role models, decreases, we might see a general decrease in crime across the board. Why would people want to commit crimes if their basic needs are met? Perhaps one can argue that the nature of humanity will always cause harm to itself, but I am hopeful. </p>

<p>Spiritual advancement and a general increase in consciousness will increase as humanity will have time to take a breather from the destructive disunity that we are currently seeing.</p>

<p>Then come the aliens. Hopefully the lizard people will also show themselves. </p>
