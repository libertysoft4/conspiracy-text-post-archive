        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How many of you have ever considered that you could get high without inhaling, ingesting, or injecting anything? How many of you have ever considered that you could trip balls without dropping acid? How many of you have ever considered that you could turn off your ability to feel pain without popping a pill?</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that we have been trained to believe we are limited. We cannot expand our consciousness, we cannot sooth our own pain or stress; we must rely on external substances. Substances that are restricted, substances that we get punished for seeking out, and substances that often have very negative health effects.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, science has been telling us that we <em>can</em> do these things on our own, but that we shouldn&#39;t because reasons. It&#39;s called the placebo effect, and it&#39;s the mind&#39;s true potential. If you <em>believe</em> you will stop feeling pain, if you <em>believe</em> you will break down the barriers of your consciousness, your mind will <em>create</em> that reality for you.</p>

<p>By relying on drugs to do this for us instead of learning to do it on our own, we are saying &quot;I am limited. I cannot do this, only this external substance can do it&quot;. Every time you do it, you reinforce that sentiment.</p>

<p>True freedom comes in the form of dropping the crutches and realizing that you could walk all along.</p>

<p>The government controls everything we know of the past. Even events that happened in our very lifetimes are being rewritten bit by bit, and when we &quot;crazy conspiracy theorists&quot; are dead there will be nobody left to remember what really happened.</p>

<p>Is it not feasible that the government has told us that regular drug usage has been the norm for untold millennia in order to justify how much drugs are being used by people today?</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t. Isolated tribes have been found in the amazon rainforest who use medicinal plants and hallucinogens. They weren&#39;t known to science until the 20th century.</p>

<p>Also, drugs work. I studied pharmacology a little at university and the efficacy of certain compounds cannot be disputed.</p>

<p>For example, did you know the human brain has cannabinoid receptors? Those activate therapeutic pathways to ease many ailments.</p>

<p>The human body produces morphine endogenously but that doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t need an external dose in case of intense pain or trauma. </p>

<p>You can view them, but can you guarantee that they are accurate, unaltered, and that any writings are correctly translated? What about the hundreds of millions of artifacts hidden away in the depths of the Smithsonian that are unavailable for public viewing? Can you guarantee that those hidden artifacts corroborate the current narrative, even without being allowed to see them? Can you guarantee that <em>everything</em> your relatives remember of the past is true and unaltered, despite the known existence of memory altering and implanting techniques?</p>

<p>And the issue isn&#39;t whether drugs <em>work</em>, it&#39;s whether they are <em>necessary</em> or <em>helpful</em>. I posit that many are not.</p>

<p>These work – I&#39;ve broken through into another world to the sound of a drum (check youtube Michael Harner shamanic drumming), but I prefer psychedelics because they&#39;re just a lot easier and have the side effect of feeling great, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Matthew 9:22
Jesus turned and saw her. &quot;Take courage, daughter,&quot; He said, &quot;your faith has healed you.&quot; And the woman was cured from that very hour.</p>

<p>Luke 7:50
And Jesus told the woman, &quot;Your faith has saved you; go in peace.&quot;</p>

<p>Matthew 9:28 - 27As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” 28After Jesus had entered the house, the blind men came to Him. “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” He asked. “Yes, Lord,” they answered. 29Then He touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith will it be done to you.”</p>

<p>If you study the bible Jesus never said that because of my great power or because it is my will or God&#39;s will. He asked if they believe and then said &quot;YOUR FAITH&quot; has healed you.</p>

<p>I believe that It was the by God&#39;s power but we cannot gain access to it unless we have faith. All throughout the bible God has said he can only operate on through the faith of someone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree with OP on all of us being able to shape our view of reality based on our own perceptions of it. But if god (which, I do not believe in) can only operate through faith of man, that then to me explains that he probably was also created through the faith of man. If you can have faith in gods power and that creates the power, theoretically you could then have faith in the god and create the god. Otherwise to me god would be independently powerful and independently exist. If god can&#39;t be independently powerful, could he independently still exist? It&#39;s an interesting question you&#39;ve brought up to my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>or people who haven&#39;t used drugs have been conditioned to believe that doing drugs is a bad thing when in reality it very well could expand your mind. There is a reason some of the 3-letter agencies have done extensive testing on drugs like LSD. </p>

<p>Better yet,ask yourself why you can eat garbage food and turn into a fat ass and that is socially acceptable,but if you use drugs you are looked at differently. You can&#39;t even call someone a fatass who is indeed a fatass because it&#39;s wrong(just making a point here I don&#39;t walk around calling people anything). However,it&#39;s completely socially accepted to shit all over drug users.</p>

<p>Ever notice when people talk about great musicians who have died from drugs people say shit like &quot;what a waste&quot;. You never hear someone say &quot;hey they might have not been nearly as creative if they didn&#39;t do drugs&quot;. To give drugs any credit (besides big pharma) goes against the agenda. If it didn&#39;t we all wouldn&#39;t automatically assume everything we do about drug users and drugs in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So meditation is the key?  I’ve known some friends who were really into meditation (think being able to meditate with freezing cold water pouring over you and not getting cold). One of them told me he could essentially travel through space or some weird void. Before he could do that though he said his body and mind would go through an intense high. He would see things while meditating and feel these electric pulses running through his body. Most people freak out when this happens and can’t control their thoughts and just stay present. That’s when most people “wake up” from their meditation and have to refocus to get back to that spot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, OP. Note the constant advertising of weed while the official condemnation of it. The hallmarks of a control structure. &quot;Weed cures cancer!&quot; &quot;Smoke weed every day!&quot; </p>

<p>Meanwhile if you do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtUKTd2WKsc">this practice</a> everyday and build up to an hour (straight) at a time, your consciousness will shift rapidly. Some days you might just feel like you are tripping, its that powerful. It is the most transformative practice I have found; so much so that me doing the practice and smoking weed were incompatible. Whenever I would smoke weed while doing this practice regularly it would feel like all of the chi I had built up from practice would be spraying out of my body uncontrollably in a harmful way... Most people don&#39;t have hardly any chi built up so its not noticed but weed is extremely &quot;heat generating&quot; (chinese medicine term) as it will expend your sexual energy and other stored chi. I believe it is promoted to weaken the populace&#39;s willpower and increase complacency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding, the placebo effect is only 30 percent effective. So it will reduce pain by up to 30 percent. I do this with my back pain and it works but only takes the edge off. I wouldn&#39;t be alive without medication. The pain is unbearable. No one can live in this level of pain without medicine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After about two years of daily meditation I&#39;ve lost all interest in weed, booze and coke. Things I used to think were a part of how I held myself together, were in reality acquired dependencies that made me feel and think that I was a powerless worm. I recently have been completely sober (not even caffeine use) and Ive literally never felt better. The answers lie within.     </p>
