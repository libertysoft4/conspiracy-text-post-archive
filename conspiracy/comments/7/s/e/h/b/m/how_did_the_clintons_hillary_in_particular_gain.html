    <div class="md"><p>Hillary has ridden Bill&#39;s coat tails all the way to the way to her NY Senate seat, her failed 2008 campaign and subsequent Sec of State appointment.  Without Bill, she would be nothing but a mildly successful lawyer.  </p>

<p>Bill ran the Mena, AR CIA drug-running operation.  He got the approval of Bush Sr who still has strong influence in the CIA. This got him into the big club and he was selected to be POTUS for his willingness to play ball and his ability to charm the masses.</p>

<p>I think you underestimate the power of the Bush family.  The Bushes are power players in the global cabal.  GHWB was and is probably the most powerful person in the US since his CIA days.</p>

<p>The Clintons are pawns, puppets.  They are nothing but well-spoken white trash who are willing to do anything.  Hillary stole White House furniture after Bill&#39;s 2nd term and had to embarrassingly put it back.  The Clintons get a lot of exposure through the Clinton Foundation that links a lot of the world&#39;s big money players.  But they are not the real oligarchs.  Think of the Clintons as the CEOs, or agents, for the real oligarchs, the real owners behind the scenes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve had this question too. There was some very funny stuff that went on with Ross Perot in 92 that probably has some bearing. Bush Sr, powerful though he was, probably was not the only senior cabal member, so his peers might not have wanted him to keep the formal power to match his cia based informal power, as that would give him a major advantage in the behind the scenes power struggles. With the USSR killed they also didn’t need to be as hands on any more, and between Iran contra, crack, BCCI, and the October surprise, people were sniffing around a lot closer than they’d like then, so Clinton would be a way to wipe the slate clean and head off these still ongoing and potentially threatening investigations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Clinton won in 1992 because Ross Perot split the Republican vote by taking 19% of the popular vote.  Had Perot not run, Bush Sr would have crushed Clinton easily.</p>

<p>Perot, a lifelong Republican, ran as an independent that election and then founded the Reform Party in 1996 and ran again (where he got 8.4% of the popular vote).  In 2000 Perot did not run.  He endorsed Bush Jr instead of the Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan.  In 2008 he endorsed Republican Mitt Romney.</p>

<p>Of course, we&#39;re never going to know what went on behind the scenes but it is important to note that Bush Sr was the Director of CFR at the time and he nominated Perot for membership shortly before the election.  Clinton was also CFR but I&#39;m not sure when he gained membership, but it couldn&#39;t have been too long before the election as he was still relatively young.  Clinton and Bush Sr had been friends for a long time and it probably started with the Mena, AR operation.</p>

<p>Politics is theatre.  Politicians are puppets.  The real power players rarely take a role.  Bush Sr had always been a power in the shadows.  He was the hand behind the puppet Reagan.  He has a lot of pull with the global elites when setting the agenda.  For whatever reason, he did not want to be president any more in 92 but instead convinced the cabal to install his protegee Bill Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no doubt he played a roll in Clinton getting the top spot. I did not realize Perot was in the CFR, that makes sense that he split the vote to allow Clinton to win.
