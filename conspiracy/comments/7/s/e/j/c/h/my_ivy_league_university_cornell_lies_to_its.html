<p>I&#39;m making a documentary about how my university, Cornell, is in the middle of a massive propaganda campaign on behalf of m0nsanto and the GM0 cartel, Bill Gates, and the rest of the gang.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the youtube trailer for my documentary:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSsQGYcEH_o&amp;amp;t=2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSsQGYcEH_o&amp;amp;t=2s</a></p>

<p>Please don&#39;t take this as advertisement, don&#39;t contribute if you don&#39;t want to. I just thought this sub would appreciate a real conspiracy: that our universities are pushing lies and propaganda to suit the biotech industry.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tone of narration is very sarcastic/biting. If you want to be taken seriously, I&#39;d dial it back a ton. Present the facts. Assume the viewer is intelligent and open-minded enough to make their own judgment. The bit about your dad seems unnecessary. The length of this trailer is fairly long, especially of you&#39;re asking for donations.  I know that is a lot of critique, but it&#39;s just my opinion. A ton of good information doesn&#39;t get digested here because of how it&#39;s presented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with all of this. I&#39;m making more/shorter lil trailers. 
The bit about my dad is to illustrate a point ... that he died of heart disease, and there&#39;s a literal conspiracy against Cornell&#39;s own professor who shows that we can reverse it. But I understand.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for your help!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that&#39;s your ideal. Perhaps I can explain further why I&#39;m doing this.</p>

<p>I hosted an independent course on campus. It was exactly as you recommend: tame, facts, evidence, discussion, no trolling, etc... no one at Cornell cared. Sure, people did in the local community and online all over the world, but this place needs a wakeup jolt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you say &quot;no one&quot;, do you mean none of the staff cared, or none of the students cared? How many people ended up taking this course?</p>

<p>Are there people who are disenchanted with GMOs who aren&#39;t already dissatisfied with our other farming practices? The short version of why I&#39;m against GMOs is, &quot;We&#39;re already fucking up the food supply a million different ways, GMOs will only exacerbate things.&quot;</p>

<p>I know the difference between selective breeding and directly altering DNA, I understand the basics of reproduction, and can extrapolate how that can cause new problems that are hard to fix. No one had to tell me GMO was bad, I figured it out myself.</p>

<p>When I was learning about DNA in high school biology, GMO didn&#39;t even exist. The idea that GMOs would be the first negative thing someone has heard about farming and so would need an in-depth technical explanation as to how it all works is really alien to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The course was a success, we averaged anywhere from 30-60 people. The q/a sessions were the best. Check them out on my website!</p>

<p>A few students were interested, and I made some good friends. But I was hoping more people would be concerned enough about industry influence to turn it into a real doozie. </p>

<p>Look up Harvard med, and how over 200 students are standing up to the rampant pharma corruption there. We need more of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The number one thing is for students to raise some hell! Also professors, but they are much more spineless. Students are customers, and the product offered has decreased in quality while increasing in price. I&#39;m thinking of starting a worldwide group for student activism.</p>

<p>Are GMOs completely unnecessary? With regards to what? Feeding the world? YES, they are completely unnecessary. I&#39;m not necessarily anti-all biotech, in fact I&#39;m pro biotech in some regards. But I&#39;m MOST concerned about the lies of the biotech industry passing as &quot;science&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not OP, but as an economist, the most troubling factor between academia, corporate interests, and government is what&#39;s known as the &#39;revolving door&#39;.  Many in academia are paid to consultation/research on behalf of large corporate donors.  In other circumstances, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/04/public-universities-get-an-education-in-private-industry/521379/">research grants</a> can be directly given by corporations.  Monsanto and DOW chemicals are big donors of academic research.  Does this make the researcher beholden to the donor?  That is the key question. </p>

<p>This is directly from that Atlantic article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Office of Research Integrity monitors allegations of research misconduct and fraud in publicly funded research. No such monitoring currently exists for corporate-funded research. That means corporate sponsors can often influence every part of the process—making calculated suggestions about everything from sampling size to specific survey questions. </p>

<p>This type of behavior extensively occurs in the economic sphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the information. I agree with the importance of the key question. It is also disheartening to know that most &#39;public research grant&#39; monies are being reduced. I assume that corp. grants will take their place and make this issue even larger.</p>

<p>This whole Monsanto/Bayer merger was brought up in the presser yesterday! A nightmare MONOPOLY! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, thanks!</p>

<p>I need to get in touch with Whole Foods! But the general consensus in our &quot;circles&quot; is that they are rather friendly to big agribusiness in general. Still, wouldn&#39;t hurt to try!</p>

<p>Haha Melania would be hilarious! How would I get in touch with her... Michelle Obama is an organic proponent, too bad her husband signed the Monsanto DARK act....</p>

<p>Thanks so much!</p>

<p>CNN: THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p>

<p>[14:30:00] REPORTER:</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>QUESTION: My other question, Sarah, is on a completely different subject. Monsanto and Bayer, who are two giants in the seed industry, are prepared -- preparing to merge. Their CEOs have met with the president, and <strong>many fear that this is going to lead to a monopoly for them and -- in the seed industry, and raising the prices, which will hurt the farm community.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is the president in favor of the merger of Monsanto and Bayer?</strong></p>

<p>SANDERS: <em>I haven&#39;t spoken with him about that</em>, John. <strong>I&#39;ll have to get back to you.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ll see if I can find out if John got an answer!</p>

<p>I hate Michael Moore, but he is great at controlling his tone. He reduces his opponents to the absurd extremes of their views as a means of showing the viewer how ridiculous that set of viewpoints are. And he does it without telling his audience what he thinks. </p>
