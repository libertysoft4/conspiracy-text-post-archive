    <div class="md"><p>Just my amateur opinion but this is probably due to the prominence of New York City, where some 18% of people are Jewish. I randomly browsed a bunch of these famous American Jews, and a great deal of them are from New York or moved there. New York is the traditional finance capital of the US, and also a powerful figure in US media. New Yorkers and thus by extension a great deal of Jews would have had access to success in ways most Americans didn&#39;t. This would then translate to seemingly high disproportionate number of powerful/famous Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have been deceived about the nature of men, women, and love. </p>

<p>It turns out that &#39;love&#39; is an entirely different experience for men and women.</p>

<p>Men can love women in a truly romantic sense, whereas women love men for what they can provide.</p>

<p>Due to legal, social and technological changes over the past several generations, the top few per cent of men (genetics, wealth and class) are now sharing the majority of women, while most men are fighting for scraps.</p>

<p>This is why most marriages today involve cheating and/or psychological abuse, usually with the male as the victim.</p>

<p>For these reasons and more, an increasingly number of men are opting out the socially-driven competition for female interest.</p>

<p>Sadly the mgtow subreddit has attracted many bitter men, who cloud the good information (much of it based on empirical evidence) which young men especially need to hear.</p>

<p>Sadly, too, many men are claiming to have &#39;gone their own way&#39; when in fact they have been sent their own way, and would instantly run back to the plantation if a alfway cute girl winked at them with a smile.</p>

<p>The world is not at all as we have been led to believe. With knowledge comes sadness, regret, sorrow, but eventually, for those with mental fortitude, knowledge also brings tremendous power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the core debates (or points of contention) on the mgtow sub: are ALL women like that?</p>

<p>The &#39;NAWALT&#39; side claim that not all women are like that, and you just have to look to find your unicorn, the woman who will not take advantage of the system which is designed to help her the moment she gets cranky with her partner.</p>

<p>The &#39;AWALT&#39; side claim that, sadly, all women are in fact like that, and it is only a matter of time until even the most amazing of women go feral.</p>

<p>I personally do not have a dog in this fight. It seems to me as though women of geenrations gone by could in fact be good, loyal wives and mothers. The current generation coming through seem like a lost cause, however, and it is not their fault: the smartphone alone has changed things in phenomenal and disastrous ways.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad to hear that. What we don&#39;t know is whether or not he is respected in the household, if he gets to make big decisions, if he is satisfied in the bedroom, etc. And I am not about to ask, because it is not my business.</p>

<p>The point here is that your own testimony here is only one part of the equation, and it is only one side of the story. One trip to r/deadbedrooms reveals just how dejected and unappreciated many men feel in otherwise &#39;happy&#39; marriages.</p>

<p>But there have always been bad ones.</p>

<p>The statistics suggest that is has certainly NOT always been like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I&#39;m pretty sure he is satisfied in the bedroom. Although, I&#39;m sure he would like to be satisfied there every night! LOL! I will be honest and say that I&#39;m not in the mood every night/day (as men tend to be).</p>

<p>Is he respected? Yes. He is the man of the house. I&#39;m a Stay Home Mom.</p>

<p>Also, check my posts. I&#39;ve consistent in my posts. I love my husband. Also, I do give him a foot massage every day too! I&#39;m not joking about that either! I&#39;ve done that since we dated! (Probably why he married me! LOL!)</p>
