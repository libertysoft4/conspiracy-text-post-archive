I know that the world&#39;s governments and their agencies are evil. But hear me out on this one. Pitbulls are incredibly nice dogs. They are also incredibly powerful which is why they were used for fighting. But that stuff&#39;s pretty much over, at least in the parts of the IS that I&#39;ve lived in, and there&#39;s Facebook pages, ad campaigns, and now a super bowl ad talking about how pitbulls are evil. I&#39;m one hell of a dog person, and I&#39;m sure this is nothing you guys care about, but what the hell is going on with this? Is it an actual conspiracy against pitbulls? Is it just being used as a cover up to distract people and rally against it so we don&#39;t think about the other evil things?</p>

<p>Tl,dr: Pitbulls are neat, why do people hate them</p>

There was a recent killing of a pitbul owner by her 2 pits. Officers on scene described the dogs still chewing on her ribcage as they had already eaten every bit of flesh off of her. </p>

<p>They can be extremely sweet, but they are still a 100lb biological death machine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is an unusual story. She was also receiving death threats and the police did admit there was someone who was a threat to her.</p>

<p>The police found her body at 8:30 pm on a Thursday and saw the dogs chewing on her ribcage &quot;early Friday morning&quot;. </p>

<p>The Sheriff has also said some unusual things.</p>

<p>For example, he claimed each dog weighed 125 lbs. he then later said that wasn&#39;t true. He also initially claimed the dogs were trained to fight, he later said that wasn&#39;t true. He said he wasn&#39;t certain why the dogs attacked but the owner was menstrating. He insinuated her dogs killed her because she was on her period...the story is unusual. </p>

<p>Her friends who first noticed she was missing said the kennel looked like it had been broken into and the police said the dogs were fiercely guarding her body. Combined with a lying Sheriff who says &quot;weird&quot; and untruthful statements and the fact that someone was making death threats yes, it is unusual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they are 100lbs they are not a pitbull. </p>

<p>Weight range for Pit bulls is about 30-60lbs. You get a few larger males that will go to 65 but its not very common.</p>

<p>At 100lbs, it would most likely be an <a href="https://imgur.com/a/W9rc9">American Bully</a>. These are a completely different breed, yet the media constantly use their pics and call them &#39;pit bulls&#39;. </p>

<p>Obviously this leads to a skewed public perception of the breed. </p>

<p>Just for your own recognition, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/MktCi">this</a> is a beutiful example of pit bull conformation. As i said, not the big scary dog that the media portrays. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate all dogs in general but do respect service dogs.  I just dont like how &#39;dog worshippers&#39;, im sure you&#39;re not one since you posting here, i blame white people culture for putting dogs on a pedestal and actually see them as equals compare to humans. 
If dogs help people, fair enough but their a line when a person treats a dog better than another human being and also make assumptions and have that mindset &#39;Dont Worry, he or she wont bite or he or she likes you&#39;. I feel like dog owners dont respect other people&#39;s personal space, i have experience this a few times in the park when dogs come to me link or bark at me and this scares me alot. The media not influencing my opinion but my own personal experiences with dogs and stories my friends tell me too thst experienced it. </p>

Fair enough thats natural but to go and focus on a few families having picnics and ruined by the dog. The owner apoligizes and thats understandable.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah same, we have a LARGE mastif/staff but honestly, all he wants is to be cuddled 100% of the time. When he was younger he was attacked on two separate occasions by other dogs runnning around without a leash. As a result now when he is approached by other dogs he is very nervous. People that can&#39;t control their dogs are a menace and if a dog is trained well and lives a good life he/she will be a good dog. Sadly the same can&#39;t be said about people which is why dogs are sometimes treated better than some people :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As others have already pointed out- a Pitbull will produce what you put into it. It becomes a reflection of the temperament and psyche of its owner. The reasons these groups so wrongfully push back against this is because rather than do the hard work- of publicly educating families and individuals about Pitbulls, helping them make an informed choice of dog, and trying to find homes that fit these categories for shelter Pitbulls, they want the easy, and all to human way out- kill kill kill. </p>

<p>Well for example, if you follow the bloodlines of APBT (American Pit Bull Terrier) back far enough, you&#39;ll get to a point where you&#39;re looking at old Irish and English fighting dogs. If you move forward in a different direction, you&#39;ll start to see these same old fighting dogs become the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. </p>

<p>If you follow APBT lines back in a different direction you&#39;ll start to see hound and pointer in early iterations of some bloodlines. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because it was how the old timers recorded the history of the dogs and we&#39;ve kept it that way, just in a digitised format. </p>

<p>But the thing is, the dogs are there for everyone. If you go to a pit bull forum you will find people willing to help you out with bloodlines. There is no secret, just a learning curve to a massive subject with a ton of history attached.</p>

<p>But we also have certain families (such as the Colbys) that have been in the game since the mid 1800s and are still breeding their lines today. There version of the breed history ties in with other versions from around the world. </p>

Most go back to the beginning of the breed. You can source historical documents of the Staffordshire bull terrier back to the mid 1800s in the UK. </p>

I personally think they evolved parallel, with a common ancestor that resembled the wolf more than dog. They both share similar characteristics, yet are very different animals in their behaviour.</p>

<p>Thats as far as that particular breed goes. Go beyond that and the breed doesnt exist, so nor does any history. </p>

<p>There are modern breeds that go further back (such as the poodle) and there are ancient breeds that go further back again. For the ancient breeds (such as the early Molosser), the sources are predictably thinner.</p>

<p>What information or sources do you expect to see? Maybe i can answer as to why they dont exist.</p>

<p>Because i fail to see a reason to keep the history of the breed hidden. It may be hard to find the information but there are photographs that corroborate the history of the breed as it developed.  </p>

<p>If after that there is some great conspiracy, you may have to lay it out straight. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The simple answer is until you get it right in relation to what you&#39;re looking for. </p>

<p>If you look at the American Bully breed, it took about 20 years to get them recognised by the various registers, some still dont. </p>

<p>In terms of genetics (and assuming you&#39;ve arrived at the perfect dog with no mistakes along the way), it takes roughly 7 generations of breeding. </p>

Firstly NO dog should ever be left unattended around a child, EVER and secondly a pitbulls unaltered attitude to other dogs which is clearly documented and demonstrable shows their fighting and violence tendencies. Unfortunately this violent tendency spills over to humans all too often. Statistics don&#39;t lie, especially when them said statistics are comparable across different countries where social trends and attitudes towards particular breeds are different. Pitbulls are more often than not the leading breed responsible for deaths among both adults and children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a working pit bull type bitch from good old pedigree. So here&#39;s my truth about pit bulls, for what its worth. </p>

<p>There are 3 types. The working type, the show type and the street bred mutts.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll focus on the first 2 as the latter cant be pigeon holed, there are too many variables with an outcross. </p>

<p><strong>The working type</strong> are high energy lunatics that can very easily kill most animals that they encounter. However, with the right owner that works the dog responsibly (I do canine athletics with my bitch), they can be a very fulfilling companion. I wouldn&#39;t recommend them for children, however they are generally very good. I just find that they reach a hyper active state too quickly. </p>

<p><strong>The show type</strong> are still a high energy dog but due to the nature of showing, they are selectively breed to be handled easier. If a family want a pit pull for a pet, this is the type i would always recommend. They can be happy to live or interact with other dogs, although there will be quite a number of exceptions to that rule due to their history. </p>

<p>The way to pick the right pit bull and avoid bad situations, is to be really honest with yourself about why you want one and research the bloodlines and there traits. If, like me you want a dog thats always ready to go at 200mph, the working type are the best dog i&#39;ve ever handled. However, if your idea of high energy is a bit of a mountain hike, the show type (or an Amstaff) may be a better choice. </p>

<p>In almost every case of a reported <em>pit bull</em> attack (and i use the term loosely as they are usually the street bred mutts, or some other large breed). the problem was that the wrong dog was in the hands of the wrong person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing with dogs is, that dogs existed to perform tasks, to do things, to be capable.</p>

<p>The fact that 9 out of 10 people who get big dogs this day and age just simply think: &quot;I want a big boy&quot; blah blah blah, but then barely walk them, sit them in a house/backyard, etc, they have no true task, you might get lucky where they think they are defending their backyard but they are going to become barkers. </p>

<p>Even small dogs had intended purposes, hunting, etc. We don&#39;t do anything with dogs anymore, so their true instinct, performing tasks, is actually dying out. </p>

<p>I remember reading how the British Kennel Club is bullshit with their regulations towards how certain breeds need to be (Pug, german shepherd fucked up hips, etc), and realized, none of those people really have a &quot;prize&quot; breed, as the true prize breed is performing a task somewhere on a farm, or where they can use their prey drive. </p>

<p>Since our society has advanced, like 96% of us don&#39;t know how to legitimately farm, this was a normal thing for EVERYONE to know 50 + years ago. We have changed a species that used to work beside us, into an animal that is becoming more and more useless without us, and is more likely to get in trouble. </p>

<p>The other funny thing is most people talk about how they want a guard dog, then no one trains there dog to be a guard dog, a real guard dog is not something to fuck around with, I remember my sister&#39;s friend&#39;s husband had a rotty, purebred female, BEASTLY girl, she was a guard dog, unlike most dogs, this dog was literally visually ripped, I swear it had that disease with the 2x muscle mass, but whatever, she was sweet in the end, just really defensive and alert. </p>

<p>I am going to be blunt here: I don&#39;t like the fact that we have taken the work out of the dog, we have stolen what made dogs dogs, and we are slowly evolving them to cats (It&#39;s almost like cats are secretly behind everything, plotting to destroy human society with brain parasites, and all other species by manipulating human behavior with said parasite to turn dogs into more submissive beasts for when the new cat overlords take over).</p>

<p>You see a person walking a big german shepherd, your like oo, that&#39;s a beautiful dog, I hope he doesn&#39;t bite. </p>

<p>Now think of an actual K-9 cop dog, that thing walks near you, your balls are going to recede into your diaphragm praying he doesn&#39;t smell the fear collecting at your ballsac, making its way down your gooch. </p>

<p>Anyway, what I am trying to say is, in the next 100 years, dogs and cats will likely not be a thing, and there is a possibility pets in general (without an intended purpose) will be considered taboo and wasteful. In 100 years, when they are facing mass climate change, lack of necessities, etc, if those of the future find out that there are 69 million useless dogs in the United States not doing anything being fed and no intended purpose of consuming said dog, they may consider us wasteful/greedy/stupid, although we are caring beings, we are not nearly as intelligent as we once were, most of us cannot live off the land, most of us down know how to tend to land and animals and livestock, a good portion of people do know how to hunt, which is good. </p>

<p>There is likely no conspiracy, its just that humans are finding means to save time/not work as hard, and although we do this, we end up losing tasks/jobs that we ourselves used to perform, as we just made something to take your job, now you can go get Universal Basic Income, go sit on the couch, wait till someone gets home, go out and pee, come back in and eat and try to lick some faces and stuff, maybe grab a toy. Is this a dog, or is this a human? Who knows...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is always weird to me the. The argument isn&#39;t that they bite/attack more. It&#39;s that when they do it can be deadly. For example, I was bit by my parents Shih Tzu when I was a kid. I was antogonizing it, made him mad, and he bit my nose on the little middle chunk of skin that divides the nostrils. His tiny little teeth managed to take a small chunk of it, but you can barely notice it today. Switch the breed to a pit bull and I probably have no nose. Or at least a reconstructed one.</p>

<p>Due to them being bred for total human compliance (when bred properly), switch the breed to pit bull and the incident wouldn&#39;t have happened in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have 2 myself. They are great pets and do a very good job protecting my home and family. They are not for everyone as they can be stubborn and difficult at times and require a strong/dominant leader. They are extremely loyal and very intuitive. They are also the biggest cuddle bugs of any breed I have ever owned. </p>

<p>Due to their genetics, they can and will most likely come out on top in any altercation. Owning them is a huge responsibility and should never be taken lightly. I do not allow mine out off leash and do not let them around just anyone. They have a very keen sense for anyone that is not on the up and up, so they do become very protective if they sense danger is near/present. I do not let them around children mainly because I do not have kids so I don’t know how they would respond. Like I said, they are a huge responsibility and for all of the reasons listed on this thread, I make sure they are never in a situation where something could go wrong. </p>

When he was younger he was attacked on two separate occasions by other dogs runnning around without a leash. As a result now when he is approached by other dogs he is very nervous. People that can&#39;t control their dogs are a menace and if a dog is trained well and lives a good life he/she will be a good dog. Sadly the same can&#39;t be said about people which is why dogs are sometimes treated better than some people :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s not, the one fact that is unclear is whether they were bred originally for fighting other dogs or fighting bulls, i.e. bull baiting. I understand if you like the breed and own one but denying a dogs bred purpose is silly at best and potentially, fatally dangerous at worse.</p>

<p>Do you not find this suspicious?</p>

<p>Why would i? We&#39;re talking about people from the 1800s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is not very far back, is it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats as far as that particular breed goes. Go beyond that and the breed doesnt exist, so nor does any history. </p>

<p>There are modern breeds that go further back (such as the poodle) and there are ancient breeds that go further back again. For the ancient breeds (such as the early Molosser), the sources are predictably thinner.</p>

<p>What information or sources do you expect to see? Maybe i can answer as to why they dont exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet the class of pit bull kill more people than any others. Why did you make this thread if you don&#39;t want to look at the reality of the situation? How do you measure aggression if not by the amount of children killed by a breed? Seriously, read those stories of pit bulls mauling their owners.</p>
