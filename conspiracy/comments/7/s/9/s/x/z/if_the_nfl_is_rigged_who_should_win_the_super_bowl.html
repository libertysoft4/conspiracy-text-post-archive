However, if it is, what would be the better outcome for the league/generate more money? Would the NFL want the Patriots to win again or would they want the &quot;underdogs&quot; (Eagles) to win? I&#39;m not sure what would generate more money. But I think if it is rigged for the Eagles to win, the storyline is perfect (Eagles overcame all the odds and won). Also, I imagine Philadelphia would benefit incredibly seeing that they&#39;ve never won a Super Bowl. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NFL can be easily rigged (and it is). All you need is a ref or two, the head coaches, the QB on both teams, the defensive captain on both teams and voila. And before you say too many people to keep quiet, when you make millions playing as well as lucrative sponsor deals, you will not jeopardize that kind of money by talking. I&#39;ve also heard that NFL contracts come with Non-Disclosure clauses so they can be sued if they talk as well.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because the players aren&#39;t involved in the fixing. It&#39;s on another level and if you believe it&#39;s not rigged with all the money involved in the sport, you should really broaden your scope here. </p>

<p>And the patriots always win because of the patriot act. Duh, so obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t believe the league was rigged until Katrina. There have been multiple cinderalla storylines for the past 20 years that made the league insane money, the coincidences kept adding up.</p>

<p>I think they go hands off most of the time but when it comes down to it they will fix the game for the team they want.</p>

<p>The Patriots are The Rock or the undertaker or whoever the big heel in Wrestling is nowadays.  you have to build the bad guy to give the good guy a worthy feel good story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think In citing to the pats you prove a lack of rigging. The patriots are the most consistent team in football on all sides of the ball. </p>

<p>It would be nearly impossible to win like that in a rigged system, there’s just too many variables to achieve that kind of result day in and out. </p>

<p>It would be much easier to rig a game with sloppy teams, penalties would be more questionable, turnovers easier to manage (can take or give one of you need to), easier to let the game slip away from one side.</p>

<p>Which would mean a team like the chargers, raiders, jags, etc, find themselves at the top, because it would just be “easier” to find opportunities to affect the outcome. </p>

<p>Idk how it&#39;s done if it&#39;s just officials padding their Vegas bets or if it&#39;s coaches owners and goodell writing a timeline for their story but I&#39;ve seen too many weird calls to make close games or no calls to cover spreads </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s my point though. In order to have refs “fixing” games, they’d have to be working towards the fix for a full 60 minutes, otherwise there’s no telling whether they will have an impact. </p>

<p>Great example is the SF/Seattle game from the video posted in this thread. 3rd down refs robbed SF of a goal line TD, which SF went ahead and got on the next down. Yes, the call forced SF to make another play, but in the end, the call did not have an effect. </p>

<p>If the theory is that refs pick their moments to turn the tide, they’d have little more success than random chance because one call just won’t make the difference in a game. </p>

<p>I think people conflate the shiftiness of NFL rules for refs fixing games when they have to interpret said rules in the moment, in game. </p>

<p>A great example is the Jesse James no catch in the Pit/Ne game from December: the catch rule sucks when you have an entire day to figure out what it means, think about how hard it is to apply in 2 minutes with two teams’ seasons on the line. In the moment it looked like a bullshit call, but objectively speaking that’s about the best attempt the officials could have put forth to interpret a poorly devised and written  guideline from the league. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the Calvin Johnson rule. That wasn&#39;t a catch from my viewpoint.</p>

<p>A spot/flag can and will change a game. So could a play call. As could a blown catch or tackle. So there are three soft spots to hit if u want a fix.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again I just cited an instance in the SF/Sea game of 2014 as evidence that one call does not fix a game. </p>

<p>One call cannot win or lose a game, it is just not the way sports works. </p>

<p>Let’s say team A is gifted a PI call to onside the 10, which they then convert into a TD. The refs made the call because they wanted team A to win. That is the only call the refs make for Team A. </p>

<p>Team B, is more talented, better coached, and more prepared. They win the game 28-7, despite the penalty. </p>

<p>One penalty does not alter the outcome, and anyone who thinks so is just looking for a reason their team didn’t win. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. But what if it&#39;s a 27-27 game in the 4th? Or what if one coach decides to give the other team a tell on their playcalls? </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="comment mb-3 ml-8" data-depth="9" data-id="dt5a0md">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Todd_Wayne.html">Todd_Wayne</a> 2018-01-22</p>
    <div class="md"><p>As to the second part: our discussion is about referees fixing games, not coaches. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s 27-27 in the 4th quarter you are talking about two teams that have both made enough plays to win, and a bad call is basically a coin flip. So once again you are talking about odds no better than chance. Moreover, who&#39;s to say the team that doesn&#39;t get the call does not make another play afterwards? (Again like the sf/Seattle game: terrible call on 3rd down, SF gets a TD on fourth anyway) </p>

<p>My point is a &quot;fix&quot; is a guaranteed outcome. One play cannot guarantee an outcome. One bad call cannot keep a team in a game, and it cannot win it for a team that&#39;s already doing its part (ie the 27 points scored before the fixed call in your example). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. It would have to be more than one call to achieve the desired outcome .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think in that instance, refs would have to go for quantity because moments of import can&#39;t really be isolated in that moment. Post-game a fumble, offside, delay of game whatever can be isolated as a key, but not in game when the rest of the story is yet to be written. </p>

<p>So refs would have to fudge every call for the fixed team, and it would be very obvious To the audience. </p>

<p>I think the better explanation is that the NFL is &quot;fixed&quot; by virtue of market share. Teams like the jags are blacked out on national television, their revenues suffer and they cannot attract talent as a result, thereby forcing them to hit it big in the draft. </p>

<p>The browns under this system are the biggest fix in sports, they will never have success under the current NFL model. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a video that explains pretty well HOW they rig the games. It&#39;s very insidious. It&#39;s also exactly how the Pats got momentum last night during the 2nd quarter. Jags: Penalty, penalty, punt. Pats: Penalty, penalty, 1st and Goal, TD. Same story, nearly every game.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BU7tt3yR24&amp;amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BU7tt3yR24&amp;amp;t=3s</a></p>

<p>As for who will win, remember that it&#39;s more than just money and numbers. NFL connects to bigger psy-ops. Think Patriots and Patriot Act in 2001, New Orleans Saints and Katrina, Panthers VS Broncos and racial division, etc. </p>

<p>NFL is strongly connected to Vegas, as well as masonic organizations. You&#39;ll see a lot of numerology. Power and control always trumps money, which is just one way to have power and control. </p>

<p>My guess is that the Pats will win and give them 6 titles, 1 more than 49ers and Steelers, to make them the greatest dynasty and Brady as the greatest QB of all time. But who knows. Look into Lynn de Rothschild and the Eagles (and Q-anon). There&#39;s something weird going on there. There&#39;s rumors that there may be a false flag at the Super Bowl, so maybe that favors one team over another. Maybe Brady did his rituals, and is now being rewarded for being a good satanist? </p>

<p>It&#39;s really difficult to predict, but it&#39;s usually obvious after the fact. </p>
