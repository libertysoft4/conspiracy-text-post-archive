        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">41</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/legend747.html">legend747</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is rather funny but my foray into r/conspiracy was due to the dramatic comeback of the Cleveland Cavilers beating the Golden State Warriors after being down 1-3 and wondering was there something afoot. My senses heightened even more after a certain baseball team also came from 1-3 game deficit and a certain time  of mine had 25 point lead in a certain important game, but I digress. </p>

<p>Several posters on this sub have mentioned that professional sports is nothing more preplanned athletic performance utilized by TPTB to entertain and distract citizens from the problems of their home and their world (Circus and Peanuts). While I don’t doubt that collegiate and professional sports are influenced by unseen powerful forces, there is down to earth evidence to suggest that many of these games in some way or another are compromised if not rigged. </p>

<p>To understand this, one must recognize these three critical factors:</p>

<p>1)  Gambling in sports is an ongoing phenomenon.</p>

<p>Not an earth shattering revelation for many sports fans. Just look at how much money is made in legal gambling (i.e. fantasy sports): well over a billion dollars. I guarantee that the amount of cash wagered illegally dwarves this. However, when people think of sports gambling they believe it is only perpetrated by the audience. The truth is that not only do the athletes regularly gamble (in their sports and other leagues), coaches, managers, referees, higher ups in the League(s),  and even team owners engage in this act.</p>

<p>Don’t believe me? From “The Fix is In” by Brian Touhy:</p>

<p>“A pertinent fact the NFL blatantly overlooks as part of its historical development is that several of its early team owners were well-known gamblers. The New York Giant’s original owner Tim Mara (whose family still owns the team) had a history as a bookmaker before and even during his ownership of the team. He wasn’t alone.</p>

<p>Another original owner whose family still has control of its franchise, Charles Bidwell bought the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals) after relinquishing his share in George Halas’ Chicago Bears. Bidwell was not just a gambler and a racetrack owner; he was a known associate of Al Capone (they shared the same lawyer, Ed O’Hare) and a bootlegger.</p>

<p>Beloved Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney, Sr. was another big time gambler who reportedly won over $250,000 over a two-day span at the racetrack. Rooney would also own pieces in several horse and dog racing tracks and reportedly hired head coach Joe Bach to work off a gambling debt he couldn’t immediately pay off.</p>

<p>George “Dick” Richards was known to be a heavy gambler outside of his car dealership when he purchased and NFL team, moving them to Detroit to become the Lions. In letters he had foolishly written, Richards detailed how he bet on his own team’s games, including upwards of $50,000 on a single content prior to selling the Lions in 1948.”</p>

<p>2)  The Mafia/Mob have their hands in sports gambling. </p>

<p>Once again, not really surprising that the Mafia/Mob would have their hands deep into a elicit activity that generates billions of dollars yearly.  Whether it is directly or indirectly, they regularly interact with the employees of the sporting world and several of the higher-ups in the league may have some type of business arrangement with these mobsters. If you interested in this particularly topic, I suggest that you read up on former mobster Michael Franzese.  </p>

<p>3)  If your gamble consistently, it is easy to get in debt.</p>

<p>For these athletes, coaches, refs and owners who gamble, at some point in their life they will amass serious debt (for owners and players, millions of dollars in debt). If they can’t pony up the cash, there are other ways to make up for it: whether it is point shaving (asked to score a certain number of points), flat out throw the game, or (as an owner) purposely handicap their team.</p>

<p>You might be wondering how those associated with these players do not call them out or try to remove them from the teams. Most likely, the other members/employees of the team are as gambling (but not in debt) and/or engage in other elicit behaviors. Exposing their teammates puts them at risk at being exposed. We’ve seen this documented in the movie industry, politics, and corporate culture. Is it really unreasonable to expect the same in multi-billion dollar sporting ventures? Ventures that our too big to fail?</p>

<p>Does that mean that every professional player gambles or is doing something illegal? No.</p>

<p>I do believe that there are athletes who not only avoid gambling but live fairly clean lifestyles. The reason they don’t speak out is that they would put themselves in the crosshairs of powerful sport leagues that have enough resources and power to blacklist and destroy their reputation. The more damning concern however is they soon must deal with the mafia/mob: entities that have no quarrels of putting these players and their family on hit lists. Disclosing to the public the art of game fixing will inadvertently open average citizens to these criminal organizations and that’s something that cannot be allowed. No player will ever put the lives of themselves or their family on the line for this, and can you really blame them.</p>

<p>Serious questions for those reading: If you had verifiable paperwork that linked violent criminal parties to professional sports leagues that are complicit in illegal gambling, would you release it to the public aware of the consequences and the forces you will reckon with?</p>

<p>So in a nutshell, large scale illegal gambling/fixing is the driving force for the outcomes of many major sports. If you are interested in this topic, I suggest you first read The Fix is In and branch off from that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point, but as I said while many conspiracy theorists argue about  sports being prepared, I lean to the more realistic possibility of large scale gambling determining the outcome of games.</p>

<p>In regards to &quot;unseen forces&quot;, I was implying about organizations who see the appeal of sports and inject their ideas into the presentation. Whether they have control of gameplay is another topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sure &quot;unseen forces&quot; have minimal impact on gameplay.  Networks and the DoD fall into this category.  Yea, sure, Fox execs tell Goddell they want close games.  But Fox execs do not bribe officials or players to get their wish.  Goddell likely talks to refs prior to the game, but... Philly/Minn proves that matters for sh*t.</p>

<p>Vegas is often seen as the counter-balance to the shenanigans of &quot;unseen forces.&quot;  Vegas keeps things legit.  If Fox execs start tweaking matches, Vegas will be very upset.</p>

<p>Lastly we have the League itself.  Most NFL conspiracy posts suggest the League fixes or directs or scripts games.  This is comical to me.</p>

<p>Other sports:  The NBA is known for having rogue refs.  These rogues are on the Vegas side, not the League side.  The NBA might talk to refs (see 2002), but that isn&#39;t a secret in sports.  I knew going into 2002 that the Kings would have to overcome the Lakers &quot;darling&quot; status.</p>

<p>College basketball is where the majority of Vegas match fixing occurs.  Players have much more impact in basketball than football, and college kids are poor, and less people pay attention to Monmouth vs Valparaiso in Jan.</p>

<p>play is 3rd and 11. the team on offense is the team that the gamblers want to win. refs call a phantom penalty on some bs and the offense gets their downs and the momentum back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All they really need are a couple key, tactical calls to swing a game. The refs can also cook the final box score by issuing penalties against the team that is scheduled to win that don&#39;t really matter or have a real impact on the game. That way the box score makes it look as if they were calling it down the middle, except the losing team had calls that killed drives or reversed a big play while the winning team would get some special teams flags or garbage time, meaningless penalties that did not really matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly....you can call holding on every play if you want to....how many times have you seen a 50 yard pass called back by a full shit holding call?
The refs can easily change the outcome of a game and you&#39;ve seen it time and time again....
People don&#39;t want to believe their favorite sport of football is nothing more than a WWF scripted match...why do you think the top market teams are always in the Superbowl?
Would anyone watch the Browns vs the Buccaneers? And who in their right mind would pay 2 million for a 30 second commercial which no one is watching?</p>

<p>Its really sad people still believe sports aren&#39;t rigged.</p>

<p>Why do you think no one watches boxing anymore?....ill tell you why...because Don King turned it into a laughing stock sport.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>small market teams make the championship all the time. Cleveland Indians, Cleveland Cavs, Wichita State for CBB, OKC Thunder, San Antonio Spurs, Carolina Panthers, Atlanta Falcons... Interestingly enough, most of them lose. But they still make it. Also, bigger markets tend to have more money available to spend on payroll in order to get the best players. Better players usually prefer to play in bigger markets because it&#39;s more endorsement money and media exposure. There&#39;s a lot of reasons why these outcomes could be expected, and without the games themselves being rigged. </p>

<p>A lot of people have theories about the NFL, such as New Orleans winning it after Katrina during their Bountygate season, or with New England winning it after 9/11 and the beginning of &quot;The War On Terror&quot;. In fact the Patriots Dynasty, along with &quot;The War On Terror&quot;, continue to this day.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those theories are dumb. Katrina hit in 05, saints didn’t win til like 09. Also, New York or even dc would make sense for 9/11... but Boston? Ok maybe a few of the flights came out of there. And yea they’re named the “patriots”; but you really think they’re rigging it for that?? Yankees made the WS in 2001 and they still lost... I’m just not buying by any of that shit. It’s a serious stretch to claim that they’re rigging any of these outcomes. I totally buy they’re rigging prop bets or even have a preferred winning team. But they can’t out right rig these games start to finish; and anyone who’s played sports understands that. </p>

<p>You bring up  a very good point. In the book in which I get most of this info from, the author mentions that even if no one came a live sporting event,  the revenue loss would be minuscule due to the huge amounts of money generated by TV contracts. </p>

<p>The one thing I wonder, however, is that with numerous different parties with an interest in the outcome can competing fixes offset each other? If I convince members of the Bulls to lose by 7 and you convince the Pacers to win by 6 or fewer the result would be very obvious.</p>

<p>The illegal betting market worldwide is far larger than the market we see. When I bring up match fixing I have friends who routinely say no way, these guys make millions a year. I think for the most part however the fix participants screwed up before they made the money and will be blackmailed into fixing fhe rest of their career.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From “The Fix is In” ,  page 128-129:</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps the NHL escaped an even bigger scandal when its Director of Officiating and Hall of Fame Referee Andy Van Hellemond resigned in 2004. It was reported by various sources with the Canadian press that Van Hellemond was borrowing money from numerous NHL officials in order to pay debts believed to be from gambling. He would request various amounts from refs he lorded over, asking for anywhere from $100 to $10,000. One former NHL referee quoted in The National Post made it sound as if Van Hellemond was practically begging for cash, asking for a $500 loan prior to a game. But because of his post within the NHL, it raises some suspicions. Van Hellemond had not just access but direct control over the NHL&#39;s entire officiating staff. What sort of deals could have been made? Especially considering Vane Hellemond was in charge of handling out the lucrative playoff assignments for referees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go watch when the Thunder player the Miami Heat. Same formula occurred. You have a star player who hasn&#39;t been in foul trouble all season and is the best player on the team opposing Lebron James.  That player proceeds to get into foul trouble early in the game in the first quarter, and again in the third and fourth quarter...severely limiting their impact in the game.  Kevin Durant and Steph Curry went from hardly ever fouling out, to being benched in the biggest games.  </p>

<p>Basketball is the perfect game for interfering.  Only five players, and they play both ways so it has an even bigger impact.  But even then, imagine if in football people payed over $500 a ticket to watch a game and Tom Brady &quot;fouled out&quot; of the 4th quarter during the last few possessions.  Basketball was made for control, especially when the same few refs are involved in some of the biggest games and a former ref outed them already as &quot;company men&quot;.  </p>

<p>Tim Donaghy&#39;s book, and some of the subsequent reporting around the scandal surrounding him, was a serious eye opener for me in many ways, but it also sort of confirmed a lot of my suspicions about the nature of money (both big and small) and the nature of big sports.</p>

From my perspective it looked like an intentional foul on behalf of a Knick just into the third quarter. The dynamics of the game shifted at that point. The wizards immediately started a comeback and I even told my buddy at that point the knicks were going to lose. Turns out by the skin of the buzzer the wizards won by one point. It was so obvious to me, being so close to the players and court allowed me to see through the play. That confirmed the belief for me that most pro sports games are rigged, especially basketball and football. </p>
