        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I want to give anyone who will listen a very serious warning about the spread of zoonotic diseases that I think the WHO/CDC is downplaying or ignoring completely. I have been doing veterinary surgery in Panama and Ecuador and recently got back from a clinic in the Galapagos islands. My colleagues and I have been noticing some very worrying trends in nearly every central and south American veterinary clinic we have been working at. I&#39;ll try to quickly summarize our findings and then go into a little more detail.
There has been a massive increase in the percentage and type of zoonotic diseases being found in the animals.
Nearly 100% of the dogs we tested had antibodies for parvovirus and  parainfluenza virus. Over 2/3 had antibodies for adenovirus and about a 1/4 distemper. These were wild type antibodies in unvaccinated dogs and in many cases we were finding that the families that owned these dogs had contracted these viruses. Many people think that a lot of these viruses can only infect their pets but this is not true.
We also found over 25% of the dogs and cats infected with dirofilaria immitis, bartonella, and wolbachia pipiens. Bartonella was nearly 70% and almost every family member who lived with the infected animal had also contracted this. Over 2/3 of the cats had T. Gondi and toxoplasmosis was very prevalent in their human family members as well. A good % of the cats also had herpes virus.</p>

<p>One of the most disturbing trends was the % of animals we found testing positive for the T. Cruzi parasite that causes Chagas disease. Even more disturbing is that we believe this is being spread by some other vector other than the kissing bug which is currently considered its only vector. Our current theories are that certain arthropods such as ticks, bed bugs, fleas, or certain hexapods are spreading this. This is particularly bad because it is being spread between humans as well and can be fatal if untreated. </p>

<p>Currently the CDC says chagas disease can be trasmitted in these ways 
-contact with the feces of an infected triatomine bug
-mother-to-baby (congenital),
-contaminated blood products (transfusions),
an organ transplanted from an infected donor,
-laboratory accident, or
contaminated food or drink (rare)</p>

<p>In our testing we have shown that T. Cruzi parasites can be transmitted between rodents through sex, unknown arthropods, and that food/drink contamination is certainly not rare. I can assure you that if it can be spread through sex between animals that it can be spread through human sex. If it can be spread from animal to animal through unknown arthropods, it can be spread to humans this way.</p>

<p>The crisis in Venezuela is going to make this much worse. Climate change is going to make this much worse. Globalization is making to this much worse when people all around the word are having south american crops in their stores I can assure you that these parasites/viruses/bacteria are going to become a big problem in Texas after the Harvey flood waters have spread everything around.</p>

<p>Some of these parasites cause lymphatic filariasis which the WHO states cannot be contracted in the United States. I can assure you that a parasite doesn&#39;t give two fucks about what country it is in and isn&#39;t magically prevented from crossing the border.
The WHO and CDC would like to pretend that many of these things are very rare or that they can only be spread through certain vectors, but this is simply not true and people need to know they are at risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the informative and detailed analysis. If there is an intentional virulent outbreak in these areas, it would seem to possibly fit in with the strategy of depopulation of areas with enormous resource potential, as well as the threat domestically of imported contagion. Please keep us posted should/as you learn more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that these things are purposely being spread around in order to reduce population. Mostly because there is no need to spread these things around, they spread on their own. But I do think that their health impact is being ignored for monetary gain or even possibly depopulation. </p>

<p>For example, it is well known that billions of people are infected with T. Gondi, the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis. It is said that it doesn&#39;t cause any issues in most people but that it can lead to toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised people. However, people with schizophrenia or bi polar disorder are much more likely to test positive for T. Gondi than people without those mental disorders. In fact in many studies the majority of bi polar or schizophrenic patients tested were positive for T. Gondi.
T. Gondi is a brain parasite that secretes dopamine and can cause anything from behavioral changes to seizures.
Bi polar disorder has no know cause but is linked to dopamine regulation in the brain. Seems like a pretty obvious connection that should be looked into more, but you make a lot more money from lifelong bi polar drugs than you would from curing brain parasites. </p>

Went to the doctor it was toxoplasmosis and we both had to stay in for a while. I even got an attest saying I could stay home from school pretty much as often as I deemed neccesary.

    <div class="md"><p>When my sister was pregnant she was diagnosed with toxoplasmosis. The doc recommended she terminate the pregnancy. She didn&#39;t and her son was perfectly normal. She had probably been infected years if not decades earlier; it likely wasn&#39;t a brand new acute infection at the time of her pregnancy. Seemed like rather reckless advice on the part of her doctor and caused an awful lot of stress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Special antibiotics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Currently recommended drugs in the treatment of toxoplasmosis act primarily against the tachyzoite form of T gondii; thus, they do not eradicate the encysted form (bradyzoite). Pyrimethamine is the most effective agent and is included in most drug regimens. Leucovorin (ie, folinic acid) should be administered concomitantly to prevent bone marrow suppression. Unless circumstances preclude using more than 1 drug, a second drug (eg, sulfadiazine, clindamycin) should be added.</p>

<p>The efficacy of azithromycin, clarithromycin, atovaquone, dapsone, and cotrimoxazole is unclear; therefore, they should be used only as alternatives in combination with pyrimethamine. The most effective available therapeutic combination is pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine or trisulfapyrimidines (eg, a combination of sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, and sulfapyrazine). These agents are active against tachyzoites and are synergistic when used in combination.</p>

<p>Careful attention to dosing regimen is necessary because it differs depending on patient variables (eg, immune status, pregnancy). Pyrimethamine may be used with sulfonamides, quinine, and other antimalarials and with other antibiotics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I can do that. I am also currently working on editing this post on how to prevent and treat/cure these things on your own using veterinary medicines. It is extremely hard to get treated for these things in the US because doctors don&#39;t seem to think its a first world problem, nor do they ever bother testing for them. So they go untreated and end up causing serious chronic conditions. Things like arthritis are often caused by parasites and can be cured if caught early enough. In the US you can buy fish/aquarium or racehorse drugs without a prescription that are exactly the same as what people take and I always keep myself stocked up on vet meds just in case of emergencies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some things I would often see when people and their pets were sick with the same thing. A change in smell of stool/gas. This is actually something I noticed in myself when I contracted worms while at a clinic. The infected cats feces had a very distinct change in smell and one day I noticed my stool/gas suddenly smelled exactly the smell and then noticed the parasite eggs in my stool. 
Anytime a person with pets starts to have body twitches or spasms or they notice their pet has started having spasms/twitches. This would almost always indicate that a parasite infection was present in the brain or nervous system. 
If someones pet came in contact with any sort of rodent or rodent nest/urine/feces they should be examined closely for any parasites and should immediately treat themselves and their pets for fleas/lice even if they don&#39;t see any. So many cases where people and their pets didn&#39;t know where they could have become infected but remembered their pet chasing a mouse outside at some point. All it takes it for one rodent flea to bite a pet and then whatever that rodent had is now in your house. 
Any rectal itching, itchy or red/puffy eyes, any stagnant water around the house or yard.
Any wheezing or labored breathing from pets can indicate mold spores in the house and the pet is kind of like a canary in the coal mine because they are smaller and will show symptoms first.
Anytime a pet tests positive for intestinal worms or parasites, their owner should too. A couple days of fenbendazole will cure this in humans. It is pretty much only used in animals for some reason but is extremely safe and effective in humans and is by far the safest dewormer. </p>

<p>u/ilikerealmaplesyrup states diamotaceous earth is &quot;great for&quot; it but doesn&#39;t mention ingesting it. (I personally thought you put it around your house.) Then mentions garlic ingestion <em>for himself</em> (not his pet).</p>

<p>Then OP gives the thumbs-up about it but doesn&#39;t sufficient disambiguate it enough to be sure.</p>

<p>Then you chime in with pet ingestion (of the garlic) plus onions.</p>

<p>Idk how there is &quot;food grade&quot; diatomaceous earth. Its got a significant amount of ALUMINA in it, and that will cause brain damage if you eat it. Breathing it in will also cause lung problems.</p>

<p>There are much safer alternatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What dose of fenbenzadole should a person take? I noticed symptoms of worms in my dog this fall, and gave this medicine to her for the three days (she&#39;s very picky with noticing medicine in food, so I used a nice big piece of crispy rotisserie chicken skin, poured the powder onto the inside of it, and rolled it up and gave this along with a juicy piece of chicken to the dog and she loved it, took it diligently every of the 3 days). I was right, her symptoms cleared up and she is healthy and put weight on, no diarrhea or blood in her stool. She had vestibular syndrome while she had the worms, the vet diagnosed the vestibular attack but said nothing about worms so I took matters into my own hands. $20 and 3 days later, very easy course of medication. I will use it on her 2-3x a year from now on, or if I notice symptoms. She eats grass in warm months, not feces but eggs can be in soil anywhere for years if I remember.</p>

<p>Parasites, and spirochites especially like to hide from the immune system in the cartilage/bone/joints and can cause really bad arthritis and joint pain.</p>

<p>Things like arthritis are often caused by parasites and can be cured if caught early enough. In the US you can buy fish/aquarium or racehorse drugs without a prescription that are exactly the same as what people take and I always keep myself stocked up on vet meds just in case of emergencies.</p>

<p>You are making a generalisation that involves 19 countries, and I&#39;m not sure you and/or your colleagues explored them all. And I know you didn&#39;t say &quot;every country in South and Central America&quot;, but anyone could read your text and then report it by saying &quot;there&#39;s this crisis in all of the countries in South and Central America.&quot;</p>

<p>Just thought this could be useful for this and other reports you might present in the future. It certainly is interesting and worth keeping an eye on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean this respectfully, but many of the things you mention are because of sanitation issues that are not present in the US (or at least, most parts). Giardia is a good example--I got that ailment just about every month when I lived in one place where it was basically an inevitability if you wanted to eat anything that wasn&#39;t cooked, like fruit. Drugs knocked that shit out fast, no pun intended. When I&#39;m in the US, I never get it. As you mentioned, things can be fatal... if left untreated. But the US hospitals even managed for an ebola patient not to die, back when all of us here were terrified it was an inevitability. Harvey is a good point, but the US has withstood the effects of several floods with no widespread plagues to note.</p>

<p>As for the pet stuff, not sure why you mention treating distemper. I took in a stray with distemper and that straight-up doesn&#39;t go to humans. </p>

<p>I get that your specialty is very different than mine. But I&#39;ll preface this by saying I have a relative who is a vet, who <em>also</em> went to the Galapagos at a clinic (small world), and wasn&#39;t concerned with any of what you&#39;ve raised here. I&#39;m not saying that your assessment is wrong, just that I don&#39;t share the same concerns based on my own experiences and understanding of how viruses/parasites/bacteria work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of this stuff is due to sanitation issues, but there are still sanitation issues in the US. Thousands of cities across the US have decades old water pipe systems that have tested positive for heavy metals, bacteria, and parasites. There are certain towns in the US where over a third of all the people tested were positive for various parasites. 
60 million people in the US have chronic toxoplasmosis infections which has recently been linked to much higher rates of Alzheimers and cancer.
I&#39;m not saying there is going to be a plague where everyone suddenly gets sick and die. These things don&#39;t cause that, they cause chronic health issues that mimic chronic diseases such as arthritis or autoimmune disorders. 
Distemper can be transmitted to humans with very compromised immune systems.</p>

<p>Not sure if I believe that without some solid citations...</p>

<p>In any case, what the OP seems to be talking about are new disease threats that are just emerging, yet everything they mentioned have been around forever, and a number of them (like the canine viruses he listed) are readily prevented by canine vaccination. </p>

<p>Look at SARS for instance. SARS is one of the worst kinds of infectious disease that nature could throw at humankind: originally spread to humans from animals, it became anthroponotic, highly infectious and airborne. Yet in spite of that, worldwide infections were kept in the tens of thousands, and deaths below a thousand. I remember when it happened, and there was a bit of havoc wreaked in isolated areas, but its spread was halted on all fronts within just a year or so. </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that there might be another Spanish flu-type epidemic waiting in the wings, but it&#39;s been almost a century since the last, and modern medicine and communication has advanced by light years in that time, so I&#39;m not that worried about it even if it does make its entrance in my lifetime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s also a dog flu outbreak.</p>

<p>I would argue no to your original question, parasites and viruses function differently. Influenza has very specific patterns of infection and mutation.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say parasites and viruses can’t attack the same host. Many people with a virus or a parasite have a weakened immune system allowing them to become more susceptible to the other. It is common that people with parasites get sick more often and have more complications from viruses. </p>

<p>My theory is the influenza pandemic in the US right now is likely the result of viral shedding from vaccines, as well as increased globalization and economic factors (people are working more, making less, and have worse access to health care). Parasites merely compound the issue and possibly increase the death toll, but they aren’t responsible for the pandemic itself. </p>

<p>Something else caused the pandemic, and the reason I believe it is vaccine / viral shedding related is because rural states with very small populations that don’t even have international airports are now infected. The only logical explanation is the delivery mechanism is beyond human to human contact, and the only probable explanation is the vaccinated are shedding the virus they inject into themselves and infecting the non-vaccinated. </p>

<p>What I believe is then happening is the non-vaccinated who get sick now have a mutated version of the vaccine virus which they are now giving back to the vaccinated which is why the vaccine isn’t working and why the only people who seem to be dying of this strain of influenza are those who have been vaccinated. It’s likely because this is a mutated version of the vaccine virus that was virally shed, found a non-vaccinated host, mutated, and then reinfected a vaccinated host with no immunity to this mutation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks!</p>

<p>re the flu:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>vaccination theory makes sense, but it needs to be flushed out with data</p></li>
<li><p>MSM is actively downplaying the flu this yr meaning there is something to hide. CDC is full of shit.MMR vaccine causes regressive autism in some cases. vaccines are not what they seem. the new flu shot only works eith 23% of people and works best on young healthy people. It is not worth the risk, and who knows what else is in that shit. vaccines dont have to go through any real vetting or approvals.</p></li>
<li><p>support for the theory could come from Hawaii, where flu is not endemic.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>heres some context data from the cdc. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/nifs-estimates-nov2017.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/nifs-estimates-nov2017.htm</a></p>

<p>If your theory is correct, then we would expect to see more cases of the flu in places where more people got the vaccine. that said factors like population density and weather would also effect the rate of spread.</p>

<p>will see if i can dig anything up.</p>

<li><p>Research viral shedding from vaccines. There’s a few studies I’ve read over the years. Use DuckDuckGo or Bing, Google censors them from search results. You’ll find them if you search hard enough, there’s a lot of data on viral shedding. It’s real, and horrifying. </p></li>
<li><p>Agreed. </p></li>
<li><p>Hawaii is interesting. First and foremost, influenza doesn’t seem to be as prevalent in countries with year round warm conditions. So climate is likely a factor. Also many Hawaiians do not trust the government, and probably do not get flu vaccines in the same numbers as other states especially since it’s less prevalent there in the first place. Many people are actually poor as well and less likely to go to the doctor if they do have the flu. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Then you also have to consider reporting. Just because it isn’t being reported doesn’t mean it isn’t happening. </p>

<p>All of the landlocked states are at pandemic levels. It’s not too surprising an island so far removed isn’t there yet, and my theory could still hold for the reasons I mentioned. Hawaii has a lot of variables not present in the mainland. I believe Alaska hasn’t reached pandemic levels either and also has a poor population which is likely under reported and isolated.</p>

<li><p>looked into viral shedding briefly. the question becomes what is this shedding into</p></li>
<li><p>hawaii is interesting because it also gets a lot of tourists meaning they have a lot of potential for bringing the flu with them. Looks like for hawaii peak flu season is nov to mar, but it happens all year round.</p></li>

<p>found this link below tracking flu in hawaii. seems like the reports might be bullshit filler, but I dont have the domain knowledge to call it for sure.</p>

<p>interestingly there is also a link to a vaccination tracker database. WTF? 
can employers make hiring decisions based on whether some one received a vaccination?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your research please keep posting here.</p>

<p>I always get confused when people I know go to these countries to vacation. I always warn them not to drink the water, especially ice in drinks, or spend time around any of the animals. They always look at me like I’m crazy, then they think about it and realize I’m not. Can’t tell you how many of them come home sick with parasites.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize how bad it actually was based on these numbers. It’s also crazy to think Bartonella which is essentially Lyme disease is present in 70% of the population. That’s an insane number to consider. </p>

<p>I predict Lyme cases in the US are much higher than the CDC will acknowledge in humans. The possibility that 70% of the animals in these countries are carrying this disease indicates to me even my estimates are conservative. These diseases are clearly being spread through other methods than just ticks to reach 70% of animals tested. My research indicates it can be spread from a range of bugs as well as possibly saliva and sex.</p>

<p>Meanwhile all those dogs and cats from Texas were shipped all over the country after the hurricanes. Rich people from the Bay Area were literally chartering private planes to go pickup displaced animals to bring them back to the Bay Area. Let’s not ignore the fact actual people were dying and suffering while these people were rescuing animals instead. Always found that bizarre during disaster. </p>

<p>But anyway we now have a major outbreak of canine influenza going around the Bay Area now after bringing all these potentially sick animals to our city. Hesitant to even let my dog say hi to other dogs right now.</p>

<p>Had to put my own dog on probiotics and medicinal mushrooms to boost his immune system after he started getting warts recently. There’s clearly something serious going on with our pets, and likely us as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn’t even think about that. Ugh makes sense and explains the 70%. </p>

<p>The thing is dogs have a higher body temp than humans, and they’re mostly asymptotic from Lyme. Only when a dog has a weakened immune system do they occasionally present with flu like symptoms. After that they merely become a carrier, and it can possibly effect their joints later in life. </p>

<p>So that means anyone who gets licked by an infected dog is at risk of getting Lyme disease. That’s insane, as Lyme eventually disables 50% of humans that contract it, and caused a range of neurological issues.</p>

<p>I myself believe I’m dealing with a Lyme infection and let me tell you it’s damaged my nervous system and I might require stem cells I can’t afford. It’s a horrible disease.</p>

<p>Some of these parasites cause lymphatic filariasis which the WHO states cannot be contracted in the United States. I can assure you that a parasite doesn&#39;t give two fucks about what country it is in and isn&#39;t magically prevented from crossing the border. The WHO and CDC would like to pretend that many of these things are very rare or that they can only be spread through certain vectors, but this is simply not true and people need to know they are at risk.</p>

<p>Turn your very true argument around: Given the societal &amp; political climate where even the most trivial arguments (climate change is real, using antibiotics left and right is a stupid idea, and parasites don&#39;t care about borders) are still &quot;open up to debate&quot; what chance does the WHO/CDC have?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What precautions do you recommend for pet owners? Are there any tests in particular they should get for their animals?  Is there like a general screening for these things and how much would it cost? Just curious. I take my animals to the vet regularly and I think they get screened for certain things already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only evidence I can give you would be pictures of research and lab notes from the various clinics I worked at. I can provide some other studies as far back as 2008 showing very similar trends in tested animals in the Galapagos islands. Almost identical rates of infection as I saw on Santa Cruz Island as well as in Panama and mainland Ecuador.

    <div class="md"><p>Your statement is well written and I thank you for the information,  Would it be possible to get a definition of Zoonotic disease within your statement so we may understand what it is?  I think that would carry a lot of weight within your statement.  I think you forgot many of us are not as informed as you.  Please consider we don&#39;t have all the basic foundation of information.  I didn&#39;t know what Zoonotic disease is.  Thanks again for this post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zoonotic means that is is something that can be transmitted from animals to humans. So something like the T. Gondi parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, or the T. Cruzi parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans would be zoonotic. HIV started out as a zoonotic disease but is not anymore as it can only infect humans currently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the explanation.  Are the diseases that are transferred new to cross over infections or normal transmissions that have accelerated?  With the numbers you&#39;ve listed, this is an alarming rate.  What might be the cause?  (Other than a change in climate?)  Your report was very good.  Again thank you for telling me about it.</p>

<p>(Some questions I&#39;ve asked may be included in your statement but it&#39;s the next day and I may have forgotten some of it.  I am sorry if I am being redundant. )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im amazed how little Vets and MDs really know about this problem.
I have a major problem with parasites in my dog and cats and myself, and the Vet tells me that Parasites arent indigenous to Las Vegas NV because its too hot here. Well, its 61 degrees right now. Too hot for parasites? I think not! Our bodies are normally 98.5 degrees, thats where they live.</p>
