        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>9/11 is perhaps the most debated conspiracy of all time, i&#39;m not sure i have ever seen a harder shilled topic in my life than this one, its like people&#39;s reality&#39;s will fall apart if this was proven to be true. This is also the one that personally lead me into becoming a conspiracy theorist, the common responses from uneducated masses to this theory is always &quot;How could they keep it a secret&quot; or &quot;The government isn&#39;t capable of such a thing&quot;. So i was wondering what are the biggest pieces of evidence you&#39;ve seen for 9/11 being an inside job? Like the biggest holes in the official government story</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tower 7. If it wasn&#39;t a controlled demolition then how did the fire even start? The fire leapt from the buildings that were allegedly hit by planes? Where is that footage? I&#39;ll believe that a plane hit the building, sure, there is video but if I am to believe that flame is hopping like that then I want to see it happen somewhere else and I want to see the video. I am not aware of the proximity to the towers and maybe it was flying debris but if I am to believe that a steel skyscraper can be taken down by just debris then what can&#39;t take them down? Apparently, explosives at the base like in 1993. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>David Chandler is the high school physics teacher who forced NIST to revise their building 7 report. In that revision they admitted that building 7 achieved free fall acceleration for about 2.5 seconds. Chandler proves in a video that it was longer than that and NIST started their collapse clock later than they should have. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSApOavkHg8&amp;amp;list=PL3705E482383CCA91">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSApOavkHg8&amp;amp;list=PL3705E482383CCA91</a></p>

<p>This admittance of free fall says it all. For a steel framed high rise building to fall as if nothing was supporting it straight down is not possible unless every support column was severed simultaneously. There is only one thing that can do that and it&#39;s not office fires. This is why AE911 wants an investigation.</p>

<p>Independent chemists have found evidence of a highly engineered thermitic material in dust samples. The use of this type of material would explain how steel was melting inside the rubble pile with extremely high temperatures for months after they collapsed.</p>

<p><a href="https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOCPJ/TOCPJ-2-7.pdf">https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOCPJ/TOCPJ-2-7.pdf</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t like to theorize about exotic weapons or holograms and stuff like that because it is not necessary. I mention the nano thermite because I believe it is solid evidence of it&#39;s presence there. All you need to know is that all three buildings came straight down at or near free fall. That is an impossibility. When you watch the northtower collapsing video in a high resolution you can see that the amount of energy being released is far greater than you would expect from floors clanging apart. Multi ton sections are thrown upwards and outwards at 70mph.</p>

<p>Just watch your way through Chandlers playlist, I also linked the paper on thermite. An interesting part of the thermite story is how ((they)) tried to say it was paint chips. The man they hired to analyze the dust and found it to be paint chips is the same guy who falsified ph levels of the dust analysis while he worked for the EPA.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.peer.org/news/news-releases/egregious-epa-misconduct-delivers-whistleblower-win.html">https://www.peer.org/news/news-releases/egregious-epa-misconduct-delivers-whistleblower-win.html</a></p>

<p>Now that was more or less independent and not an official government body calling them paint chips, but you can see that there was an effort to confuse the red chips with paint.</p>

<p><a href="https://digwithin.net/2012/02/17/when-mohr-is-less-the-official-non-response-to-energetic-materials-at-the-wtc/">https://digwithin.net/2012/02/17/when-mohr-is-less-the-official-non-response-to-energetic-materials-at-the-wtc/</a></p>

<p>This is the world we live in. It&#39;s not the same one that is portrayed on TV. We are all left dealing with the reality of it. Some folks can&#39;t handle it and lash out in anger when you mention it.</p>

<p>Best of luck with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally was not into 9/11 theories until maybe 4 years ago. Watching the tower 7(a building I never even heard about) video changed everything. I can&#39;t say this is evidence but just what can change a persons perspective on 9/11. Tell them to spend an hour watching videos of all plane crashes in the history of the world. They will see thousands of pieces of airplane wreckage everywhere. Then ask them to find the same evidence for the plane crashes from news footage the day of 9/11. Tell these people to spend an hour to watch every steel skyscraper that has ever been on fire or hit by a plane in the history of the world. See if they find any that have collapsed(let alone at free fall speed and 3 in one day). Tell them to spend an hour watching controlled demotion of skyscrapers then ask if the 3 towers collapsing reminds them of anything. Tell them to read 2000&#39;s &quot;Project for the New American Century&quot; written by Dick Cheney, Jeb Bush and Donald Rumsfeld calling for a &quot;new Pearl Harbor&quot; to transform America. </p>

I&#39;m not saying he wasn&#39;t involved in some capacity but terrorists can&#39;t wait to take credit for the shit they do and before any real investigation had even started everyone was saying he did it and at the same time he denied any involvement. Of course, he could have been lying but I thought that was really weird. It was months before anyone claimed responsibility. </p>

<p>Instead, people may consider watching CIT&#39;s (citizeninvestigationteam.com) work on the pentagon.  They funded their own way there and did extensive interviews with thw cab driver, 2 pentagon police officers and a third one by phone who said he saw the plane flying over the building &quot;and away&quot;.  With the rest of the testomony taken by witnesses there should be any doubt the plane never hit and instead, they had rigged the place to blow.</p>

<p>Sad excuse is sad. </p>

<p>But here you are, saying it is needlessly overcomplicated, and not practical. </p>

<p>Which is it, eh?</p>
