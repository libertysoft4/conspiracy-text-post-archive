        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Unfortunately, we all give energy to the Saturnian control matrix, some more than others, but that is the problem we face. </p>

<p>Money is the god of our civilization. In god we trust, no? But which god are we trusting? I don’t see any Christian symbols on our money, but I do see Saturnian symbols on our money. </p>

<p>One cannot serve two masters. You can’t serve money and God. We are all second hand Satanists and we all are unwittingly giving our time and energy to the dark one. </p>

<p>We love to point our fingers at the elite and blame them for all our troubles, but we never look within and realize just how much we contribute to the evil in our world. </p>

<p>We all assume that we can have a revolution, arrest the evil elite and then the system would be finally be just and fair, but would it? Does it matter who is in control of a system that is inherently evil? </p>

<p>I believe we need to have a spiritual revolution before we can have a successful political one. We must work on ourselves and find ways to thrive outside of the system that wishes to control our minds, bodies, and even our souls. Change comes from within and perhaps the system is just a reflection of our collective mind. Therefore we must change ourselves before we can expect to see any differences in the world we live in. </p>

<p>Many people are waking up to the evils of this system and are looking for a true hero and leader to fix things. I believe that is why Trump is so popular among his fan base. They are good people and they want change, but they don’t see why there is a problem in the first place. </p>

<p>TLDR: Be the change you want to see in this world! </p>

<p>Light dispels dark. If a person finds themselves in the light, it&#39;s because the light came to them. People in darkness love the dark, it is only when the darkness is pierced by the light that our true condition is made known, and it is never the persons own effort that got them there. </p>

1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;

    <div class="md"><p>Why argue over the this? The important thing is the teachings of Christ. It’s about loving and forgiving one another. That’s what we need to heal the world. </p>

<p>The older religions had positive teachings but in many cases they also called for human sacrifice. I believe God sent his only Son to be sacrificed so that humans no longer felt they had to sacrifice others to please God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evangelicals are the most deceived of any Christian group. It’s insane the mental gymnastics they use to defend their positions on Trump and Zionism. </p>

<p>Trump is not a Christian. He lives on the 66th floor on the 666ft trump tower, in a modern day shrine to Apollo. Trump tower is full of the black cube of Saturn and he even has the black cube clock outside of the tower with 666 encoded right on it. He supports the synagogue of Satan in Israel and he is the opposite of a good Christian leader. </p>

<p>I try to reach out to these folks, but they think I am evil for talking bad about their god emperor. Trump and the Zionists have their followers under a dark spell and then reinforce the magic with top of the line data analytics to maximize their message. It’s some powerful stuff and it has become a serious cult of personality. They are in a deep trance. Very alarming. </p>

<p>I am not your typical Christian. Don’t lump me in with those that fall for the political trap. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how you can appeal to servitude to a diety and independence simultaneously?</p>

<p>My pagan beliefs are about gratitude of the complexity of nature/science, without an obligation that I am below it. Yes, I honor the greater system, because it is complex and sustains me, but it honors me because I sustain it. Does that make sense? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that we need to have personal revolutions, but I&#39;ll expand on it, especially for me- we need to have growth asking four domains.
First we need to have growth as the rulers of our lives. Developing our skills as effective managers who have systems to bring order around the things we do, like how to create and manage money or how to run our households.<br/>
Second, yes, we need a strong spiritual life. A personal philosophy that helps us cope with the hard times, see through the bs, and grow as pillars of strength in our families and communities.<br/>
Third, we need to have a strong physical life. That means knowing how to exercise,  having some self defense training, and understanding some basic information on how the human body works.<br/>
Fourth, we need a creative and social outlet. Both a strong community around us that we can grow through our lives and a way to be creative in it.   </p>

<p>The problem with western culture, as I  see it, is that our school system is stuck teaching our kids how kids needed to be taught during the first industrial revolution, we&#39;ll over 100 years ago. It&#39;s so outdated a system that it&#39;s producing kids who are completely mistrained and at a severe disadvantage with the reality of today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it’s not a cheery topic, but I am fed up with our society, and I want better for the country and its people. With our tax dollars we have paid for the fiery death of millions of innocent people over the years. So much evil gets done on our dime, and even if you don’t think is satanic, it’s still fucked up and must stop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you want us to throwdown money?
You realise that the whole system is built around money and we have to participate in order to survive the modern world?</p>

<p>I agree with you that we should not worship money. Money should not be an objective, like it is now for most companies.</p>

<p>Money should be used as a tool. A tool to achieve something. In my opinion is should be used in a way that humanity evolves.</p>

<p>My religious view of the world is that we are here to learn from a dualistic world. In this 3D world evil is needed in order to get the experience. Thus, in my opinion, there will always be evil in this world.</p>

<p>I think the Bible is a great book, which teaches us valuable lessons &amp; guidelines. So do many other religious texts. Why wouldnt there be truth in all of those texts? In my opinion we shouldnt be fighting over which religion is the best.</p>
