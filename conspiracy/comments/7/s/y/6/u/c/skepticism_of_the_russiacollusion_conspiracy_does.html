<p><em>Soon after, <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> stickied a direct link to it. Now the comment section shows obvious signs of vote manipulation.</em></p>

<p><em>TMOR has increased their attacks against me as of late, and this includes regularly stickying links to my submissions and manipulating the comment sections.</em></p>

<p>When I questioned the behavior of Israel I was labeled an &quot;antisemite&quot;.</p>

<p>When I questioned the policies and military interventionism of George W. Bush I was labeled as &quot;unpatriotic&quot; and a &quot;crazy leftist&quot;.</p>

<p>When I questioned the foreign policy/drone assassinations of Obama I was labeled an &quot;extreme right-winger&quot;.</p>

<p>And today, when I question the Russian collusion/bogeyman narrative I&#39;m labeled a pro-POTUS Russian &quot;agent.&quot;</p>

<p>I find it interesting that expressing doubt or concern over the &quot;official&quot; narrative and policies of TPTB/MSM gets one automatically pigeonholed and &quot;classified&quot; by those who parrot and embrace the status quo.</p>

<p>They are attempting to use these issues to turn us against each other, when we should really be setting our sights towards the top of the pyramid.</p>

<p>They&#39;ll continue to pull these labels out of their asses because honestly, at this point, it&#39;s all they have left.</p>

<p>Just remember that if you get attacked by these partisan hacks, then you know you&#39;re doing something right.</p>

<p>Also, when your posts are regularly <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7sx41b/top_mod_axolotl_peyotl_defends_himself_as_a/">stickied</a> at <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a>, then you <em>really</em> know you&#39;re doing something right.</p>

<p>Keep fighting the good fight! Much love <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true...what&#39;s funny is they actually believe that just because their narrative is upvoted and any dissenters are downvoted...that&#39;s it..end of argument, mission accomplished..</p>

<p>All they ever really manage to accomplish is to show they cannot be trusted to adhere to truth when it does not align with their agendas.</p>

<p>We see this happening even now...on a grand scale in almost all political conspiracy posts that involve one topic and one topic only...Trump.</p>

<p>And yet..we still have to listen to the babies cry that the sub is overrun with T_D shills...</p>

<p>Well...the truth says different...everyday now we see the anti-Trump upvoted massively and the pro trump downvoted massively..</p>

<p>And if you are one of the really unfortunate ones who dares to criticize Trump, his policies or actions of any of his cabinet (fuck you Haley..and fuck you too Tillerson) while at the same time call out the blatant propaganda spin from the liberal/progressive democrats...just get used to it.</p>

<p>At some point in going to demand the right to call anyone who says this sub is now overrun with pro Trump users a fucking liar any time they do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As one of the loudest voices that talks about Trump/Russia in this sub, the one main issue I have regarding skepticism is the intellectual dishonesty, or willful ignorance involved.</p>

<p>It’s one thing to look at the facts of the case and make your own determination, it’s another thing completely to just avoid the facts all together.</p>

<p>The fact that people constantly say things like “where’s the evidence” despite a year+ of consistent uncovering of new facts on the case, four indictments of individuals with significant roles in the campaign, etc., shows that there is a concerted effort to sweep things under the rug.</p>

<p>At the end of the day we’re all just users on a forum, we don’t have control over where the investigation goes. I just hope people are willing to accept the findings when they come out </p>

<p>you mean facts about Mueller&#39;s past, the fact that the original hacking assessment was made by an Atlantic Council cybersecurity firm, or the fact that not even during the height of the Cold War did intelligence agencies make an official claim that members of the govt were &quot;puppets&quot;, but oddly now they have because of meetings with diplomats, facebook ads, and amounts of dirty money that likely change hands every single day (and people have been pointing out but get called &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; in every other context but &quot;Trump-Russia&quot;)?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Guarantee you the same people that will call Trump’s former campaign manager and NSA head unrelated to Trump will spin this as meaning bad news for Hillary&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s place this in the proper context, which was in a subject about <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-president-maryland-based-transportation-company-indicted-11-counts-related-foreign">the Mark Lambert indictment</a>, where he was arrested for trying to bribe Russian officials. It has a tenuous connection to Uranium One, and no real links to Hillary Clinton in particular.</p>

<p>I was commenting on the fact that there has been a strong effort to tie this indictment to Clinton in this sub (if you don’t believe me on that, I’ll find sources), even though there’s a few degrees of separation there. </p>

<p>There is also an effort to describe the four criminal indictments in the Russia investigation as “having nothing to do with Russia” or “nothing to do with Trump” despite the fact that Flynn and Papadopoulos were charged with lying
about Russian connections (and have started cooperating), and his campaign manager and deputy being charged for being paid to lobby for the pro-Russia party in Ukraine while also helping to change the Republican platform to one that was exactly in line with the party they were lobbying for</p>

<p>To see the Lambert indictment as having bad implications for Clinton, but the four indictments I described above as inconsequential to Trump takes extreme mental gymnastics. That’s what I was trying to say, I hope that helps clarify things!</p>

<p>There was no &quot;original&quot; FBI investigation into Uranium One or Clinton. There was, however, an investigation into a kickback scheme with a Rosatom subsidiary that was entirely unconnected to anything Clinton though.</p>

<p>It’s tricky to prove but if you’ve studied how money laundering through shell companies works, a company like this should be raising some eyebrows.</p>

<p>Paul Erickson was the one who emailed Rick Dearborn about the “Kremlin connection”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,” the N.R.A. member and conservative activist, Paul Erickson, wrote. “He wants to extend an invitation to Mr. Trump to visit him in the Kremlin before the election. Let’s talk through what has transpired and Senator Sessions’s advice on how to proceed.”</p>

<p>I think it is clear that Russia has been trying to influence our elections for some time now and they cant be the only ones.  The US has know about foreign influences for decades now.  The only thing that changes is the how.  Why has the US not done much to prevent this?

<p>Your insertion about their cooperation is flat out wrong. All the statements and charges are online. Fun reading. They got them for lying, no more than that. In Flynn&#39;s case his contacts with Russia are well detailed, all of them occurring after election.</p>

<p>The other two were for things done way before any of this Russian narrative was a gleam in Hillary Clinton&#39;s eye. They have nothing to do with anything.

<blockquote>
<p>Premature disclosure of the fact of the defendant’s arrest and the nature of the charges against him is likely to substantially prejudice both the defendant and the government. Defendant has indicated that he is <strong>willing to cooperate with the government</strong> in its ongoing investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Public disclosure of the defendant’s initial appearance, however, would significantly <strong>undermine his ability to serve as a proactive cooperator.</strong> In addition, public disclosure of defendant’s arrest and the accompanying criminal charges may alert other subjects to the direction and status of the investigation.</p>

<p>You&#39;re complaining that people aren&#39;t interested in the Russiagate narrative. The natural inclination of this sub is to be skeptical of any agenda pushed on such a scale by the U.S. press. </p>

<p>In the comments sections we often see comments equating an opposition to Russiagate as pro Trump, pro government, pro republicans, pro alt right. We&#39;ve been called Russian trolls, Russian bots,  Putin&#39;s puppet, been told to 
 &quot;Go back to Russia&quot;,etc. </p>

<p>Yes there are accusations of shillery coming from the other side too. But Axolotl&#39;s sentiment is one many here share. The constant agenda to demean those going against Russiagate seems much more pronounced to me.</p>

<p>Free thinking doesn&#39;t equate to equal opportunity of ideas. Pretty sure we all freely think pussy is awesome, amirite!?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahhhh u/axolotl_peyotl good to see another wonderful post by you. Just for everyone&#39;s info, this specific mod has been caught numerous times banning people who disagree with him on this sub or call him out for his partisan politics. Let me go ahead and post a comment on the r/TopMindsofReddit sub that shows some of the comments he banned people for and how he abuses the threatening violence reason for banning people.</p>

<p>&quot;OGpiven</p>

<p>The right wing propaganda machine also loves &quot;DESTROYED&quot;. &quot;NFL players DESTROYED&quot;, &quot;Eminem DESTROYED 😭😭😭&quot; REEEEEEEEEE EDIT: I got banned for this post? Lmao</p>

<p>Reason for Ban: Threatening, harassing, or inciting violence permanent</p>

<p>Rufuz42</p>

<p>You have the biggest victim complex on this website. People disagree with you, either respond to their replies with facts or don’t at all. You just post thinly veiled messages about shills and outsiders trying to tear down your righteous thoughts and posts.</p>

<p>Reason for Ban: Threatening, harassing, or inciting violence permanent</p>

<p>sPooPysCaRysLeleTons</p>

<p>isn&#39;t this attacking other users of this sub?</p>

<p>Reason for Ban: Threatening, harassing, or inciting violence permanent</p>

<p>Diddy_Schlong</p>

<p>Well that didn&#39;t take long. Axol couldn&#39;t hold off on pushing more republican bullshit on this sub. Even after his little pity party self post saying he would stop being so political and grow up because he&#39;s a mod here. But he just couldn&#39;t help it. Let it flow baby. Just let the bullshit keep flowing. Must cheerlead for Trump and make sure this sub is a conservative circle jerk</p>

<p>Reason for Ban: Threatening, harassing, or inciting violence permanent&quot;</p>

<p>And let me just add here a little something; the reason other users &#39;portray skepticism of the Russia Collusion conspiracy as GOP and Trump shills&#39; is usually due to the fact that the only evidence really presented so far against the investigation is the cooked up text messages scandal against some FBI agents. All the evidence we have currently points to there being no scandal at all whatsoever, and it just being an attempt by the GOP to drown out a very possibly huge conspiracy.</p>

<p>Deciding not to question a government&#39;s actions.</p>

<p>One of these is not like the other.</p>

<p>Surely questioning the government, any government, every government, is something every conspiracy-minded person should be doing, so when someone, a mod as well, decides to be vocal about not questioning the government on what is a potential conspiracy unfolding before our eyes, it throws up flags to believers. So of course you get a lot of negative response to it. When people question pizzagate, or Uranium One, or Seth Rich, or 9/11, or a plethora of other conspiracies, they get a lot of negative feedback because of it. It doesn&#39;t matter who is right or wrong, it doesn&#39;t matter what the topic is, as long as it&#39;s big enough you will get a negative response if you go against it.</p>

<p>LOL, I&#39;ve been hearing about China and Russia &quot;influencing elections&quot; since the 80&#39;s... the people who are still claiming Trump was somehow involved are most likely just bitter losers.

<p>There is nothing wrong with being skeptical but too many in this sub completely deny it. I wish that were an exaggeration. Skepticism is not saying the investigation is about Hillary or Obama or whatever. It&#39;s also not brushing aside everything that has happened so far with the indictments.   That kind of denial will lead someone to believe you support the government because Trump is the government now. </p>
