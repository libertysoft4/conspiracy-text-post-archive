<p>Really? Isn&#39;t the United States government killing people in foreign countries by Drones and other methods that has been on going through three Presidents and <strong>both</strong> parties since 2001? I don&#39;t see much change. As for Israel and Jerusalem, the USA is <em>still</em> kissing Israel&#39;s ass just now adding a little tongue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your critique of Trump is just about his personality and the things he says. Nobody really cares about his past relationships or things he said 10-20 years ago.</p>

<p>We care about conservative policies and stopping the country from falling down the pit hole of Progressivism, communism, and socialism which the Democrat party has wrapped its arms around because of the young vote and colored vote.</p>

<p>What has Trump DONE since he’s been in office that you don’t like?</p>

I do not like his position on family values as he is a huge hypocrite. He also let Mcconel stop pay for the military during the shutdown on that note though I was deploy from 2010-2011 when the government shit down and my pay was stopped and brewed my distaste for Obama.
