        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I used to be an avid alien believer, and am now on the proverbial fence about some things I&#39;ve believed for well over a decade.  </p>

<p>For starters, there&#39;s a man by the name of Paul Hellyer, who was the Defense Minister of Canada, which is the Canadian equivalent of the US&#39;s Secretary of Defense. If anybody would know the truth about aliens, one of the two heads of the North American continent&#39;s military would probably be one of them.</p>

<p>He says he believes we have at least 5 species that we have had some varying degree of communication or cooperation with. He mentioned a Reptilian one, but not shape shifting, iirc.</p>

<p>I take issue with the idea of shape-shifting, b/c my layman&#39;s logic says you can&#39;t condense a 6ft+ muscular, Reptilian body into a 5&#39;6&quot;, 139 &#39;Merican pound Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence or sources other than David Icky weirdo, and some blurry video of eye glitches by celebrities and football announcers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could believe Reptilian aliens before shape shifting humanoids. I also went down the flat earth rabbit hole, and still leaning to a creator made matrix/dimension. This isn&#39;t a flat earth post, so let&#39;s not get sidetracked arguing that. I like the theory that we are in a space time loop though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I think the planet is as you see it. </p>

<p>And the people that have assumed control are just very intelligent and sadistic, and they have learned how to &quot;team up&quot; with each other as time progressed, to achieve their sadistic goal of taking over the world. </p>

<p>But they are just that; human. Just like you and me, and they can and will be defeated. As smart as they are, our com unity easily matches them. And there are more of us each day. </p>

<p>Someone like you wants to be able to look down at their phone and click open UndeniableReptilianProof.mp4 and have it be in perfect quality. You want others to do the work and present the evidence in neat little digestible packets of information. </p>

<p>There are <em>hundreds</em> of reported UFO sightings submitted daily. Do we have a 1920X1080 HD picture of every one of these? Of course not. They still get reported. <em>Hundreds</em> of actual people took the time to report they saw a UFO.</p>

<p><em>Hundreds</em> of people claim they saw some reptilian shapeshift. Where&#39;s the pictures? The videos? We don&#39;t have any at the moment. </p>

<p>This is where it&#39;s up to <strong>YOU</strong> to decide whether the information resonates with you or not. No one is going to do that work for you. The ball is in your court.

<p>what makes us think that a highly developed alien race isn&#39;t capable of doing this at a different level? maybe is our arrogance or fear to believe we are being so highly deceived.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I swear on a thousand bibles that I saw on 2 separate occasions the left eye (of 2 different women I had been sleeping with) go from a human pupil to a cat like slit and back in about a third of a second. I was both times Dead sober. Honest to goodness I saw this with my own two eyes. It was not at all alarming and each time I did not react. Was this perhaps my perception projecting onto them?</p>

<p>You would have other types of comments about the relation, even more so if you had sexual intercourse with such beings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will give you some info, take it or leave it, whatever you like:</p>

<p>First of all there is of course no evidence for shape shifting aliens. The reasons for this are many and worthy of a separate explanation.</p>

<p>This whole theory basically has to do with the idea that everyone&#39;s soul is immortal. You are on this path of learning about everything and this life in a human body and all others before or after it are merely lessons for you to master. The beings we call Aliens are, according to this theory, actually extradimensional beings. 
They are thousands upon thousands of learning cycles ahead of us. 
They are consciousnesses that can manifest in nearly whatever way they desire. 
Some of them are here to help us in our development, others wish to exploit us for their own good. 
This reptilian or human or little grey body is just a vessel for this spirit, he can enter or leave it just like a driver entering a car. It can also alter it in any way it desires.</p>

<p>If you want a kind of proof concerning the extra dimensionality, you could listen to the art bell call on YouTube, to name one source of information. You will not find more reliable external proof than that.</p>

<p>If you have further questions just ask and I will try to answer to my best knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just thinking this based on a prior comment and I want to revisit it in the near future to expand on what you laid out here. </p>

<p>A brief synopsis would be that our &quot;soul&quot; is an anchor to interdimensionality. This is how we have the ability to remote view, how we have psychics, how people have visions and details about past lives. Your comment adds to this. Eastern religions believe in reincarnation. They are some of the older religions. Maybe they learned this from past lives. Maybe the so called shapeshifters are people that have learned to switch their bodies from other dimensions. </p>

<p>Some religions say that based on how you live in life determines your next form. What if the decrease in world animal populations is actually because of the increase in human population. Not because of our impact, but purely based on the number of souls to go around. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Concerning the animal /human population thought of yours, a couple of days ago I had exactly the same thought!</p>

<p>I disagree with the religious concept of moving up or down the evolutionary ladder as this implies mistakes can be made. From what I have learned there are no mistakes. The evolution goes in one direction only, the only thing that can change is your individual speed of evolution. You will be given a series of challenges throughout your life, if you fail to learn your lessons you get another go but as you cannot recall why your are incarnate in your life you will preincarnatively program stronger challenges into your next incarnation until you realise from within what you should learn. So the worst thing that can happen is that you get stuck in this dimension for countless lives, but everyone will get it and evolve naturally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen it happening. However, not into reptilian form. The human body is energy, there is electromagnetic energy field that streams out of the heart encompassing the body like an outer layer. When the third eye opens, energy also streams through (in a higher quantities) the pineal gland. When you connect with all your reincarnations in the now (time doesnt really exist), then you can channel these different beings (which are other aspects of you) to connect with you and in some cases an energetic overlay will happen where your own face shapeshifts into the other versions of you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll submit the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Live">They Live</a> as a kind of attempt to discredit the concept of lizard people by packaging its ideas in plain sight but in such low-quality and semi-ridiculous way as to discredit the idea as nothing more than B movie fodder.</p>

<p>Most thinking people I know who have seen the movie find the premise to be eerily believable -- ordinary humans manipulated by subliminal propaganda for the benefit of an alien/lizard elite.  Yet most people also agree that it&#39;s a really poorly made film, marred by bad acting and a fairly silly and over the top conclusion.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s possible to argue it was all done on purpose.  Put the truth out there, but in a package that&#39;s easily ridiculed, and now nobody believes the truth because obviously it&#39;s silly.</p>

<p>I always ask myself why this movie -- among so many -- hasn&#39;t been remade, but with a larger budget which enables more realistic actors, settings and effects.  Most people think the original&#39;s concept is solid, just very poorly executed.  I think it&#39;s because a remake done well could possibly cause a lot of people who wouldn&#39;t think otherwise to start questioning the subtle propaganda around them and wondering who really benefits.</p>
