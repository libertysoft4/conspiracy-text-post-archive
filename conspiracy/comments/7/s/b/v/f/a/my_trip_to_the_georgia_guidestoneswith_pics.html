<p>Last year I went to the Guidestones. It was pretty much what I expected bar a few things that I hadn&#39;t heard about. </p>

<p>Firstly, the entire guidestones area is surrounded by holly bushes on 3 sides, I&#39;m sure everyone is aware the symbolism there. </p>

<p>Secondly, a stain, bowl, and glove made the whole area look like it was recently used for a ritual. </p>

<p>Thirdly, a security van showed up, not from the same county. The security company &quot;General Transportation Administration LTD&quot; yielded little results when I checked last year. When we left the Stones after being there for a little under 2 hours we were followed once we got onto the interstate by a black SUV for about 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Finally I noticed that the building directly across the street and behind the rows of trees is pretty odd. The way the trees are arranged makes it to where the building has a perfect view of the stones, but pretty much nothing else. Check on google maps for a better view. </p>

<p>Just posting to share and I was wondering if anyone else who has been to the stones has had a similar experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The great seal with a caduceus and seal of Solomon on it are rather interesting. There is a vague company profile to be found online, looks like it&#39;s based out of Augusta. The address points to an ambulance service building, which I suppose explains the caduceus. Could be a patient transfer vehicle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did they take an active interest in you while you were there? There&#39;s always the possibility they had an appointment up that way, and were hanging out at the site because they were a bit early / had nothing else to do. That said, the logo, ambiguous company name, and lack of phone number on the van all point to something being unusual about them.</p>

<p>First thing I thought of when I saw the great seal / seal of Solomon combo was this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.liederschatz.net/occult/images/dollar_thegreatseal_asmon.jpg">http://www.liederschatz.net/occult/images/dollar_thegreatseal_asmon.jpg</a></p>

<p>The caduceus is also connected to this, when you rule out the superficial medical connotation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also an ancient symbol of the roman god <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_%28mythology%29">Saturn</a> - Who is mostly  a god of agriculture but is better associated with generation and dissolution (or death and rebirth).  He&#39;s associated with Time, especially in relation to the changing seasons.  And the first consort he was associated with was Lua, a war goddess known for receiving the blood soaked weapons of conquered enemies of war.  When you break it down, it&#39;s pretty creepy for them to have a commandment about keeping the human population low, then surrounding the stones with a symbol of Saturn.  </p>

<p>Celtic Lore associates Holly with the time running from the summer to winter solstices, representing the darker half of the year.</p>

<p>And in Christian mythology, many believe that the Crown of Thorns placed upon Christ&#39;s head during the Crucifixion was made of Holly twigs.  So if you take this meaning, Holly was used to kill the savior of man.  There is some argument that whoever placed these stones is likely a member of a Lucifiarian cult, so placing something that harmed Jesus, who would be one of their enemies, is a pretty blatant slap in the face of anyone who knows that particular meaning of Holly - or a protective ring for anyone who thinks like them.  </p>

<p>Either way, ringing this place with Holly, considering their likely religious bent (and anyone advocating for the genocide of 80% of man cannot be a good person, no matter how twisted their interpretation may be), isn&#39;t a symbol of love, light and joy.  It&#39;s likely targeted at some of the darker associations of the plant.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s basically a wannabe-Stonehenge engraved with a handful of Ten Commandments-esque guidelines (hence the &#39;guide&#39; in &#39;Guidestones&#39;). It was erected in 1980 by a dude who took every possible measure to keep his identity secret, and to this day we do not know who or what was responsible or even their motive. Because of this shadiness and the fact that the engraved ideals are an almost perfect match to those of the NWO, some have theorised that the Guidestones are some kind of sanctuary or temple the elites use for their occult rituals.</p>

<p>It could, which is why I am not as convinced the Guidestones are a monument to the NWO as some others here are. However, that explanation becomes a bit problematic when we take all the shady surveillance into account.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How much is a small fortune btw?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Elberton has never released exact figures, but an exec did go on record saying he thought Robert C. Christian &#39;a nut&#39; and gave a quote several times higher than anything the company had ever done before to shut him up. Christian apparently accepted the ridiculous number without even <em>trying</em> to negotiate.</p>

<p>Slow cull with poisons is still a culling. I can&#39;t believe you are defending the guide stones. Do you have no soul?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earth is getting overcrowded my man, we&#39;re on a floating spaceship with limited, finite resources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prove it. I do NOT believe in finite resources. It is a lie. One of the biggest conspiracies is that of artificial scarcity. Take a look at this picture:
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/Hw4xDtd.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/Hw4xDtd.jpg</a></p>

<p>Those are not sand bags. What you are seeing is millions and millions of tonns of grain that was purposely destroyed so that paradigm of artificial scarcity could be maintained. Every bag represents a life ruined. Every bag represents a malnourished child that had to go to bed hungry. This is a real life holocaust.</p>

<p>I ask why are people not allowed to eat the grain that is rotting in the above picture? It is because scarcity is an artificial construct created by man&#39;s greed and the greed of the oligarchy that runs this planet. Poverty is something that is engineered by the powers that be so that they may control us as slaves. He who controls the food controls the people. Starvation is engineered by the powerful in the same way Stalin engineered the Holodomor genocide in soviet times. Starvation poverty is manufactured in modern times via a system of debt, wage slavery, and central banks creating money out of thin air. This money is then funneled into the pockets of the oligarchy who use it to buy up and hoard the world&#39;s resources.</p>

<p>A similar artificial scarcity exists in housing where we have more empty houses then there are homeless people. Why aren&#39;t the needy given use of the empty homes? Why is the government taking housing projects built for the poor and tearing them down? These are perfectly good buildings. It is because we living in an evil greedy society than values <strong>things</strong> more than it values people. </p>

<p>We have a distribution problem not an overcrowding problem. </p>

<p>A couple hundred years ago the De-Beers corporation figured out how to take an stone abundant in nature and make it more valuable by cornering the market and restricting the supply. We call these common stones &quot;diamonds&quot; but the truth is they are nearly worthless. It is a big scam. If the true supply of diamonds was sold on the open market the price would collapse. Diamonds would be so cheep you would be able to buy the handful and nobody would really care about them. The constraint that keeps prices high is purely artificial and also opens a paradox.</p>

<p>The metaphysical nature of money is that it does not value abundant things at all but instead <strong>perversely incentivizes scarcity and destruction</strong>. Money is not a creative force, it is a destructive force. For example take what happened in Flint Michigan. In a monetized society a river of clean water has no value. However, if that river becomes polluted and destroyed then it can be monetized as something of value because clean water is now scarce. People will pay good money for clean water and it can be sold by the bottle. People will NOT pay if it is free and abundant but they will pay after it becomes scarce and is no longer available. The water bottling companies are making a killing in Flint selling to a captive audience. Do you understand what is going on here?</p>

<p>This is the paradox of abundance. If you destroy things then they become more valuable. That is a paradox. Destruction creates value in our world because of the inherent way money works. Money does not value abundant things but instead seeks to destroy what is abundant and make it scarce so it becomes valuable through scarcity. </p>

<p>Here is another example. Would you buy air from a corporation if they sold it in a can? Most people would say no, that is a joke. Air is free and abundant. What if the air was polluted and you couldn&#39;t breath it anymore for free without harming your health. Then people would surely pay for it. Think it couldn&#39;t happen. It is not a joke. Breathing, something we take for granted is a luxury people pay for in heavily polluted China. Polluted New York and LA also have oxygen bars. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xhppHAI7C8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xhppHAI7C8</a></p>

<p>This is the reason FREE energy technology is suppressed by the powers that be because there is no price point on the supply and demand curve to sell limitless free energy. Energy must always be kept artificialy scarce for it to have value. </p>

<p>When free energy is taken into account the sky is the limit is far as population goes. The Earth could have 50 billion people on it if we wanted to though I am not sure we would actually want that world. However, 10 billion is not an unreasonable number. There is absolutely no reason to cull the 7.6 billion down to to 500m. Criminals like Bill Gates should be put on trial for crimes against humanity for pushing vaccine frauds on people. The whole oligarchy should be jailed for plotting mass murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Let’s run through some numbers of food production and consumption. The world produces about 2.5 billion tons of cereals at present. A person needs a little more than 500 grams a day in grain-based diets, or 200 kilograms per year, which would be equivalent to one ton of cereals for a family of five. If we consider that the family would become richer and shift its consumption patterns to include more milk, meat, and eggs, it would need more cereals because animals would need to be partly fed with cereals. If we consider a grain-based diet with an already-moderate consumption of protein, current world cereals production could feed more than 10 billion people if distributed well.&quot; </p>

He interviewed the man who was in charge of the stone masonry company at the time the job was commissioned and persuaded him to reveal the hand written letters he had exchanged with this “RC Christian” guy. I just don’t remember what it’s called. </p>

Looking at the lady in the photo it doesn&#39;t look like she&#39;d be a big deterrent to anyone looking to cause trouble at the site. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the web site doesn&#39;t look to be fully functioning nor updated since 2014. The address they list doesn&#39;t seem to match up to any company there, but I&#39;m not in DC to confirm that.
