        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I find it a common occurence to say that people accused of being guilty of conspiracies participate in &#39;satanic rituals&#39; or cults. 
When I see Satanism I think of LaVey&#39;s Satanism and I&#39;m kind of curious as to what this generalized &#39;Satanic cult&#39; is supposed to be referring to. Is it all just some scattered assumption where people with bad intentions worship goat heads and jerk it to Lucifer? Is it more of a way to make these people look &#39;evil&#39; by pointing fingers and yelling &#39;SATANIST!&#39;? </p>

<p>I&#39;m just curious as to if anyone has more insight on this &#39;Satanic cult&#39; accusation commonly thrown in with child sex traffickers and the like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re gnostic sun worshippers. But at the end of the day that&#39;s a sophisticated form of satanism. They believe Adonai, the god of order or &quot;the God&quot; (as we know him) imprisoned us and that only Lucifer can break us free. So yeah, that&#39;s what they are. You can do your little rituals all you want but they&#39;re the ones doing the big rituals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think the term gnostic is descriptive of the enemy. They do worship the sun, However not the sun we see in the sky today. The planet Saturn was the main luminary in the ancient sky and Saturn is considered the most high god of the occult elite. Research electric universe theory, Saturn myth, and Saturn Death Cult for more information on this. Everything starts to make more sense when you see the truth about our ancient sky.The stories and myths of the gods/planets are anthropomorphic histories of the epic electric plasma display of The celestial luminaries before the great deluge. </p>

<p>Saturn/Satan aka Molech/Baal/Repham ate his children to prevent them from challenging his power. This is the origin of satanic ritual abuse among young innocent children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting you mention Lavey</p>

<p><a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/the-hidden-life-of-marilyn-monroe-the-original-hollywood-mind-control-slave-part-i/">https://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/the-hidden-life-of-marilyn-monroe-the-original-hollywood-mind-control-slave-part-i/</a></p>

<p>Before becoming famous, Norma Jeane went by the name of Mona and worked as a stripper at a Burlesque house in Los Angeles. There, she came in contact with Anton LaVey, the man who would later found the highly influential Church of Satan. According to Springmeier, LaVey was an MK handler and Monroe became one of his “Kitten” slaves.</p>

<p>“Marilyn Monroe was an orphan, and during her infancy the Illuminati/CIA programmed her to be a Monarch slave. Before becoming an actress, while she was still a stripper, she spent time with the founder of the Church of Satan Anton LaVey. Victims of LaVey have pointed him out as a mind-control programmer.”</p>

<p>– Ibid.</p>

<p>LaVey’s biography also mentions an “affair” with Monroe, which was probably more than that.</p>

<p>“When the carnival season ended, LaVey would earn money by playing organ in Los Angeles area burlesque houses, and he relates that it was during this time period that he had a brief affair with a then-unknown Marilyn Monroe.”</p>

<p>Anton LaVey and Aleister Crowley also play into the satanism thing.</p>

<p>There are also a ton of victims on youtube who talk about being part of satanic rituals involved with human sacrifice and human blood drinking.  </p>

<p>look into Michael Auquino. He started &quot;The Temple of Set&quot;  and was the in charge of psychological operations of the US military.  </p>

<p>Also look into Satanism in Hollywood.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;When interrogated, Thomas Kokoraleis confessed that he and the others had taken women back to Gecht&#39;s place – what Gecht called a &quot;satanic chapel.&quot;[5] There they had raped and tortured the women, and amputated their breasts with a wire garrotte. Kokoraleis went on to say that they would eat parts of the severed breasts as kind of a sacrament, and that Gecht would masturbate into the breasts before putting them in a box. Kokoraleis claimed that he once saw 15 breasts in the box.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>I think it started with the satanic panic going on in the late 20th century. Loads of people were accused and even prosecuted because of this. An example of this is the Oak hill daycare. The 2 workers there were accused of sacrificing animals in the daycare, having sex and inviting other people to have sex with the kids and even flying them out to have sex with people. They were eventually found innocent.</p>

<p>There could be Satanists that literally worship Satan but mainstream satanism is edgy atheism.</p>

<p>And just to tag on to what other commenters have said. If you read into Alister Crowley he was one weird dude. While he did some taboo things for his time like homosexuality and orgies he didn&#39;t really do anything illegal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Occult is the opiate of the elites. &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot; enables them to do whatever they need to stay in power. Meanwhile, the masses are told &quot;thou shalt not&quot; to keep them in line. LaVey created commercial Satanism as a smokescreen for theistic Satanism. The Occult philosophy is slowly being brought down to the masses in an attempt to supplant Christianity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because Satan/Lucifer is indeed real.  Remember the quote from Usual Suspects?</p>

<p>&quot;The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn&#39;t exist.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s just truth in plain sight.  LeVey put up a good front pretending that Satanism was just some atheistic eye poke to Christians.  Much like L. Ron Hubbard (also a Satanist) he knew the truth but hides it from the lower rankings of his followers.</p>

<p>This short vid sums up the current situation:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xinU9_0ZRo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xinU9_0ZRo</a></p>

<p>The world is controlled by people who covertly worship Lucifer.  He gives them real power in this world.  Once you realize this you should also realize that God is also real and be able to see that the one thing they have been pushing you away from your entire life is a literal interpretation of the King James Bible.  All Bible colleges push people away from it.  All modern science tires to push people away from it.   </p>

<p>The truth is the KJV Bible is the word of God and all that you need to obtain salvation is repent and believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>Repent of your current state of unbelief and sin and turn toward God telling him you understand what he did for you.  That&#39;s it!  It&#39;s so easy and these Satanists want to hide this one important truth from you.  Repentance and belief in the Gospel is what saves.  No good works, no going to Church, no donating to charity, no being a good person.  We are all sinners and nothing we do can help.  Only trusting in what Jesus Christ did saves us.</p>

<p>Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p>Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>church of Satan do not worship Satan , they Believe Satan to be a force of nature rather than an Angel who simply rebelled against God .</p>

<p>the modern term &quot;Satanist&quot; covers a wide variety of Idol worship  such as Baphomet , Ba&#39;al , Moloch , Marduk , Dagon .  </p>

<p>these &quot;cults&quot; are what forms the modern interpretation of &quot;Satanist&quot; and &quot;devil worshiper&quot; , they have nothing to do with a Rebel . </p>
