        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a question I come up against often when I&#39;m discussing the Oct 1st shooting, and my own doubts about the official story.</p>

<p>Whoever I&#39;m talking with, whether in person or online, they usually come up with some kind of variation of &quot;Why are you, or anyone else not involved in the investigation, automatically entitled to evidence in a mass murder case?  Do you think you&#39;re some kind of investigator?  Can you think of reasons that this information needs to be shared with the public?&quot;</p>

<p>It should be a no-brainer, but if I&#39;m honest, I&#39;ve never really had an articulate, succinct rebuttal for this line of thinking.  </p>

<p>Hopefully, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> can help here.  Whether it&#39;s Sandy Hook, or 9/11, or Vegas, why should footage of the event be released to the general public?</p>

Yes, this right must be balanced against the government&#39;s legitimate interest in mounting an investigation that brings culpable individuals to justice.

<p>what does that have to do with your right to see evidence </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A mass shooting that involved hundreds of people in a public place is a matter of public interest, especially in the city where it occurred.</p>

<p>There&#39;s tons of precedent for a larger swath of information coming out well before it was &quot;case closed&quot;, so to speak, to the point where we could say that Las Vegas is the exception, not the rule, even if the particulars of any one case when compared to Vegas varies.</p>

<p>Given that the official theory is that Paddock acted alone, and he&#39;s dead, there&#39;s no reason to be so secretive.</p>

<p>Of course, using their own words from earlier this month, they consider the investigation to be at the &quot;pre-indictment&quot; stage, which suggests that there is someone alive who may be indicted, as it&#39;s not legally possible to indict and try deceased person.</p>

<p>From:</p>

<p><a href="http://news3lv.com/news/las-vegas-mass-shooting/las-vegas-police-push-for-more-secrecy-in-route-91-shooting-investigation">http://news3lv.com/news/las-vegas-mass-shooting/las-vegas-police-push-for-more-secrecy-in-route-91-shooting-investigation</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The response also states that ongoing privacy is necessary “during the pre-indictment stage of an investigation,” without saying if an indictment is pending.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Includes full legal response to lawsuit launched by media against LVMPD re: level of secrecy.</p>

<p>Of course, using the &quot;pre-indictment&quot; term only raises more questions, as do some of the items that HAVE been released recently. I&#39;d humbly suggest that the unsealed documents may in fact be a backstopping tactic, but that might suggest I don&#39;t believe the crazy lone gunman theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This argument is awful. </p>

<p>With the Boston Bombers, sure, they knew <em>who</em> they were, but that doesn&#39;t help the FBI find them or stop them from doing something else... So they give the public photos hoping someone sees them and calls it in. </p>

<p>In the case of las Vegas... The guy is dead, yeah, but if there&#39;s more to the story and they&#39;re investigating - and if others are involved - it&#39;s better to keep it secret. </p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible to have a fair trial when all potential jurors have seen evidence alongside shitty commentary on TV or online. If the evidence is out there before trial, jurors will be biased, and it could hurt the prosecution.</p>

Like I&#39;ve said in previous comments, if you or anyone knows of laws that do guarantee the public&#39;s ability to view evidence in ongoing criminal investigations, please share. I&#39;m not trying to argue this as I&#39;m the end all know all of how things work. </p>

<p>What is this JFK assassination you speak of? It sounds interesting. </p>

<p>People reasonable expect a casino to have a security system in place to prevent someone from bringing an arsenal into their room and murdering 58 people with it.  </p>

<p>My position is that the casinos should be forced to shut down until they explain why their security system failed.  </p>

<p>Well, you see, hotels really won&#39;t look twice if you bring this box called a suitcase with you, even if you bring 5,6, even 10.  Lots of their employees will even help you carry these boxes to your room if you are willing to tip them.  So if you put the bang-bang stick in the box, the hotel doesn&#39;t know what exactly it is.  Unless you want them to X-ray everyone&#39;s luggage in and out of the hotel.  That sounds fun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your totalitarian opinion, can the public&#39;s right to know, a right that our Founding Fathers felt was self-evident and one of the basic pillars of a functioning democracy, ever legally trump the government&#39;s &quot;right to withhold&quot; information that the public has a legitimate interest in knowing?</p>

<p>Imagine that you are the lawyer tasked with arguing the public interest is better served by withholding everything the government has found out about the most deadly mass shooting in United States history in this specific case. Because that&#39;s what this legal argument comes down to in the end: the public interest.</p>

<p>The default is that the public has the right to know whatever its government knows unless this can compromise another important public interest. So what is your legal argument? What more important public interest is served by withholding information in this specific case considering that according to the very government whose secrecy you are defending, there is no living criminal to mount a case against?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I guess I&#39;m not going to answer this question directly. First, to me it seems like I see the question &#39;Why haven&#39;t we seen video of Paddock&#39; posts and very few answers like the one you&#39;ve posted. But, since there are, inevitably, posts like that...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to lie, I <em>want</em> to see video of Paddock. And, I think we have every right to see him on the streets in and around Vegas. The city has full control of that footage and has no reason not to let us see it. However, just being realistic, I respond to all posts questioning video (or lack thereof) simply because whether it&#39;s in police custody or not, it&#39;s part of the ligation against Mandalay Bay and probably LVMPD. Not that it&#39;s right. But, honestly, this is why we haven&#39;t, won&#39;t for a long time, or ever see it. </p>

<p>BUT, I think it&#39;s quite ridiculous the city of Vegas hasn&#39;t released one of the 500+ images they claim to have around the Vegas area.  </p>

<p>&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always seen this amendment as protecting freedom of conscience and voicing ones opinion.  </p>

<p>I just think if the government wants our consent they need to make available information to make an informed decision on key issues.

<p>The freedom of the press, protected by the First Amendment, is critical to a democracy in which the government is accountable to the people. A free media functions as a watchdog that can investigate and report on government wrongdoing. </p>

<p>“The press was to serve the governed, not the governors.”</p>

<p>—U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black in New York Times Co. v. United States (1971)</p>

<p>As James Madison wrote: &quot;A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever
govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. We have been so conditioned to the supposed &quot;rights&quot; of our government institutions to control us and the supposed &quot;rights&quot; of corporations to do whatever results in the highest corporate earnings that we have seemingly forgotten that, at least according to the Constitution, the government is allowed such &quot;rights&quot; only when they ultimately serve the public interest and corporations are allowed such rights only when they do not conflict with the public interest.</p>

<p>Of course the public always has the right to know whatever the government knows. The government governs only at the will of the public it serves. Thus, to withhold information it has from the public, the government must always successfully argue that it is serving the overall interest of the public in doing so. That has always been the legal argument for government&#39;s withholding certain &quot;sensitive&quot; information from the public in ongoing criminal investigations whenever the dissemination of that information has chance of interfering with the apprehension (or more controversially prosecution) of the culpable criminals. Since there are no living criminals to apprehend or prosecute in this case, the government has no legal argument for withholding what it knows from the public it serves and the public has every right to this information. Hence, the court cases that media outlets have filed to obtain this withheld information have all the legal merit in the world. The government would have to repeal the First Amendment to prevail in these cases, at least at the SCOTUS level.</p>
