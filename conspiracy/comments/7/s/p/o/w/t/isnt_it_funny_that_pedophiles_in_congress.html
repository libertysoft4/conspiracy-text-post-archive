<p>Edit: to everyone saying Weinstein epstein and government officials weren&#39;t charged with anything, you have to know that they would settle out of court and have NDA and gag orders so you would never ever ever know the magnitude of their actions. Nassar can&#39;t afford this so you see. He had a baby amount of power conoared to those yall keep defending and saying they get less time bc they only raped a few people..  Ffs your buddy would let you off easier too... I&#39;m sure epstein and weinstein bought silence and settlement to a level nassar couldn&#39;t but I wouldnt doubt they commited just as much damage. Everyone defending people who were convicted of raping 1 child for a 5 year sentence are sick and psychos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weinstein has not been convicted yet, also the women are not minors. Jeff epstien has only been convicted of soliciting sex from 1 minor. Mark Foley charged of having laised with 2 underaged boys, was not convicted.</p>

<p>Im not defending anyone, all of these men should be in jail. My point was that the sheer volume of victims in the Olymics coachs case is why he will get such a long sentence. More than 160 girls have accused him of assaulting them, thats the difference.</p>

<p>Yes of course theres always been two judicial systems, one for the rich and one for the poor but you’re not arguing with facts, and the elites you referenced have not been accused of anywhere near a similar amount of crimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Epstein was accused of having hundreds of girls at his island, on his plane, and at his many properties around the world. </p>

<p>Weinstein is accused of having minors to solicit at film festivals and elite political parties. The cannes film festival caused him of having over a 100 girls over a 12 year period. And the congressional page scandal saw some 80 boys say they were abused. Jimmy savile is accused of abusing people in the 100s. They git away with it appearing to be minor bc the system is rigged for them...</p>

<p>The other two people you mention, i will say again did not have 150+ women testify in court against them. That is the difference.
Im not defending them, stop accusing me of it, im just basing my argument on avaliable facts and not my emotions and word of mouth without proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually your wrong.  Nasser was convicted of molesting only a handful of girls. The rest testified only in connection with sentencing.  They could say whatever they wanted. Nothing had to be proved.  Epstein was far worse.   You miss the point that people like Epstein are not seriously prosecuted notwithstanding the extraordinary amount of victims and evidence.  To say he was never convicted is nonsensical.  He wasn’t convicted because he wasn’t prosecuted for virtually all of the allegations against him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, we&#39;re definitely on the same page, but I don&#39;t have a good answer.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like when a cop gets sued and the city has to pay out the lawsuit. </p>

<p>On the one hand my tax money shouldn&#39;t subsidize the behavior of bad cops. On the other hand, the street cop who kills an unarmed man probably won&#39;t ever be able to pay the (let&#39;s say $3 million) in restitution the victim&#39;s family is entitled to.</p>

<p>So what now? If you force the former cop to pay, the family never sees a dime, and the city and police force don&#39;t have much of an incentive to change. </p>

<p>If you fine the department, now the city is stuck with the bill, but given that the local government is comprised of elected officials, there&#39;s the potential for accountability, despite the fact that that doesn&#39;t seem to happen very much in practice. </p>

<p>Ultimately, there needs to be enough of a financial incentive to affect change, and in today&#39;s world that penalty needs to be quite high, otherwise some corporation will just let things happen once they realize the cost to settle a lawsuit is less than the cost to retrain their staff and change their corporate culture.</p>

<p>Fucked all around!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im not disputing that others might be getting away with shit, nobody here is. What the issue is in what you put forward is that 1 was a doctor in a special position of trust (well above Weinstein in standing) abused it some 150 times, had people testify and pleaded guilty. On the other hand you have weinstein with a handful of people coming forward and him not pleading guilty as he intends to fight it in court. He&#39;ll get his time but there is a profound difference between the two as far as legal grounds are concerned. Obviously you are not in any way affiliated with the legal profession or even a very good understanding of how courts work otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be doubling down on stupid.</p>

You also need to take into account quality of evidence, cooperative defendents etc. You are implying I think a certain way because i disagree with you by posing this question rather than that I think you dont understand the legal system very well, and would like everything to be cut and dry, which it isnt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just having a similar conversation with someone about this yesterday.  It&#39;s almost like this guy is getting the hammer as some sort of absolution for the Justice system that has gone easy in those before Nassar. </p>

<p>I think of the rich kid suffering from &quot;Affluenza&quot; who killed 5 while drunk driving.  Didn&#39;t get any jail time for KILLING 5 PEOPLE!!!</p>

<p>Not defending Nassar, far from it, but yes OP, I agree, something is a little off about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair. Also interesting to note the difference is not just in the media, but also in sentences handed down. Women just seem to get off easier (no pun intended).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This particular statement by the Judge seems all well in good to most people, given the context of this particular case, but it seems to undermine the way our current system is working, with so many people serving jail time, doing so for victim-less crimes or one sort or another:</p>

<p>&quot;That’s what’s going to happen to him, because as you get stronger, as you overcome —because you will  — he gets weaker and he will wither away. Prison is no place for a human being to live.”</p>

<p>If she does feel that way about prison, why do we allow people that are not violent, not stealing, or abusing people, placed into jail terms (sometime with ridiculously long mandatory minimum jail terms) into prison? </p>
