        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://solargeneral.org/wp-content/uploads/library/jewish-defector-warns-america-benjamin-h-freedman.pdf">Mr. Freedman knew what he was
talking about because he had been an insider at the highest levels
of Jewish organizations and Jewish machinations to gain power
over our nation. Mr. Freedman was personally acquainted with
Bernard Baruch, Samuel Untermyer, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin
Roosevelt, Joseph Kennedy, and John F. Kennedy, and many more
movers and shakers of our times. This speech was given before a
patriotic audience in 1961 at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C</a>  </p>

<p><strong>Parts from the speech, regarding World War 1</strong>  :  </p>

<p>&quot;After we got into the war, the Zionists went to Great Britain and they said: “Well, we performed our part of the agreement. Let&#39;s have something in writing that shows that you are going to keep your bargain and give us Palestine after you win the war.” They didn&#39;t know whether the war would last another year or another ten years. So they started to work out a  receipt. The receipt took the form of a letter, which was worded in very cryptic language so that the world at large wouldn&#39;t know what it was all about. And that was called the Balfour Declaration. The Balfour Declaration was merely Great Britain&#39;s promise to pay the Zionists what they had agreed upon as a consideration for getting the United States into the war. So this great Balfour Declaration, that you hear so much about, is just as phony as a three dollar bill. I don&#39;t think I could make it more emphatic than that. That is where all the trouble started. The United States got in the war. The United States crushed Germany. You know what happened. When the war ended, and the Germans went to Paris for the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 there were 117 Jews there, as a delegation representing the Jews, headed by Bernard Baruch. I was there: I ought to know. Now what happened? The Jews at that peace conference, when they were cutting up Germany and parceling out Europe to all these nations who claimed a right to a certain part of European territory, said, “How about Palestine for us?”  And they produced, for the first time to the knowledge of the Germans, this Balfour Declaration. So the Germans, for the first time realized, “Oh, so that was the game!&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Regarding Jewish boycott of Germany as early as 1933</strong>  </p>

<p>After a while, the Jews of the world called a meeting in Amsterdam. Jews from every country in the world attended this meeting in July 1933. And they said to Germany: “You fire Hitler, and you put every Jew back into his former position, whether he was a Communist or no matter what he was. You can&#39;t treat us that way. And we, the Jews of the world, are serving an ultimatum upon you.” You can imagine what the Germans told them. So what did the Jews do? In 1933, when Germany refused to surrender to the world conference of Jews in Amsterdam, the conference broke up, and Mr. Samuel Untermyer, who was the head of the American delegation and the president of the whole conference, came to the United States and went from the steamer to the studios of the Columbia Broadcasting System and made a radio broadcast throughout the United States in which he in effect said,“The Jews of the world now declare a Holy War against Germany. We are now engaged in a sacred conflict against the Germans. And we are going to starve them into surrender. We are going to use a world-wide boycott against them. That will destroy them because they are dependent upon their export business.” And it is a fact that two thirds of Germany&#39;s food supply had to be imported, and it could only be imported with the proceeds of what they exported. So if Germany could not export, two thirds of Germany&#39;s population would have to starve. There was just not enough food for more than one third of the population.  </p>

<p>The boycott continued for some time, but it wasn&#39;t until 1938, when a young Jew from Poland walked into the German embassy in Paris and shot a German official, that the Germans really started to get rough with the Jews in Germany. And you found them then breaking windows and having street fights and so forth. Now I don&#39;t like to use the word “anti-Semitism” because it&#39;s meaningless, but it means something to you still, so I&#39;ll have to use it. The only reason that there was any feeling in Germany against Jews was that they were responsible for World War I and for this world-wide boycott.Ultimately they were also responsible for World War II, because after this thing got out of hand, it was absolutely necessary for the Jews and Germany to lock horns in a war to see which one was going to survive.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too upvoted you.  I find it amazing that people actually believe everything in history books written by the victors many years after the events.    Just think about current events.  Do we really know anything that&#39;s actually happening?  Do we really know what private conversations take place behind closed doors?   Do we know what private wars are being fought today?  </p>

<p>Take the tarmac meeting between Clinton and Lynch.  We will never know what was actually discussed.  Yet, do we really think some historians a decade from now will somehow magically know what really went down?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay that nationalistic kind of thinking is why we had these wars.  People are not &quot;entitled&quot; to land.  Palestinians lived there for thousands of years.  Britain colonized it (basically usurped the land from its people) and then sold it to the Rothschilds.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re implying Anti-Semitism then go ahead and say it. </p>

<p>Yes, according to Old Testament, Jews lived in that part of the world.  However, they had had been displaced all over Europe and Asia in a slow process over hundreds and thousands of years.</p>

<p>The Old Testament&#39;s documenting of a people&#39;s native geography of the era does not give Jews (Zionists) the right to displace Palestinians.</p>

<p>It is analogous to United State&#39;s treatment of Native Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing to be stated.  OP wasn&#39;t necessarily evaluating morality of creation of Israel, but rather the methods and motivations of that creation.  Furthermore, OP is showing that that very creation is quite the OPPOSITE of what is generally taught.  So the argument shouldn&#39;t be about whether Jews have right to Israel or not, the argument should be, &quot;Was Israel created in an immoral way?&quot;  </p>

<p>And by OP&#39;s evidence, the answer is YES.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel only existed as a country for 72 years in Antiquity. Before that, it was Canaan. And after that, it was a province under both Greece and Rome known as &quot;Palestina&quot;. (The Europeans referred to the place as &quot;The Land of the Philistines&quot;. That&#39;s the etymology of Palestine.)</p>

<p>It makes sense, since the Philistines were proto-Greeks. So when Alexander the Great came in to the region, he identified with the Greeks in the region. </p>

<p>So the place was known as &quot;Palestine&quot; for literally thousands of years.</p>

<p>It was known as &quot;Israel&quot; for 72 years.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be like if some future historian traveled to Virginia and someone referred to it as being in &quot;The United States,&quot; and the historian saying, &quot;No, this was the Confederate States of America.&quot;</p>

<p>Did the Confederate States of America exist?</p>

<p>Yes, but for only a fraction of the time of a place called &quot;The United States of America&quot;.</p>

<p>Hell, playing by Israel&#39;s logic, aboriginal people in the region can one-up them and demand the place be called Canaan. That pre-dates Israel, as do a dozen other names. (Though the names of the place have changed, DNA studies suggest that the people themselves did not.) DNA demonstrates incredible population continuity. Which means that the same &quot;pagans&quot; who lived in Canaan are the same Israelites who lived there in Antiquity. And they were the same Christians who lived there in the Roman period, who were later converted by the sword to Islam in 800 AD.  </p>

<p>Lots of different place-names and religion: But the SAME people. </p>

<p>Germany elects a leader who unabashedly refers to Jews as &quot;subhuman parasites&quot; and blames &quot;Der Jude&quot; for destroying Germany. A group of Jewish organizations decide to boycott German goods and the revisionists ignore all previous actions and focus on that as somehow being the start of WWII.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reality is the opposite. Zionism was opposed by Jewish communists, and Zionists opposed the communist, internationalist wing.  It was pushed by western powers for its opposition to communism, which explains cold war foreign policy.  Zionists and European fascists have a common intellectual and conceptual history.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most Jews, until after WW2 were anti-zionists. Massad&#39;s essay has the following part which clarifies why this is hard for moderns to grasp.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After World War II, a new consensus emerged in the United States and Europe that Jews had to be integrated posthumously into white Europeanness, and that the horror of the Jewish holocaust was essentially a horror at the murder of white Europeans. Since the 1960s, Hollywood films about the holocaust began to depict Jewish victims of Nazism as white Christian-looking, middle class, educated and talented people not unlike contemporary European and American Christians who should and would identify with them. Presumably if the films were to depict the poor religious Jews of Eastern Europe (and most East European Jews who were killed by the Nazis were poor and many were religious), contemporary white Christians would not find commonality with them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition the Zionists and the Nazi&#39;s were cooperating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where are these anti-Zionist Jews? I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;ve never heard a Jewish person talk about how they don&#39;t think they deserve a homeland in Israel.</p>

<p>My point was that Hitler saw the Marxists/Communists, many of whom were Jewish, as the true enemy. When he went after them, the international Jewish community reacted with the boycott.</p>

<p>It does seem that Hitler and the Zionist Jews didn&#39;t actually have much animosity towards each other. He facilitated their transfer to Israel through the Haavara Agreement, after all.</p>

<p>Today they are found among the Ultra-Orthodox Jews, who are anti-Zionist on religious grounds. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMQ9C6vni0w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMQ9C6vni0w</a></p>

<p>There are also still remnants of the universalist side of the debate who are represented by intellectuals like Chomsky, Finkelstein, Blumenthal, etc. </p>

<p>This is part of the story.  Fascists are anti-communist.  After all, the first prisoners in the concentration camps were communists.  Jews, who where not Zionists, had one political movement in which they could freely participate and that was inclusive, and that was the broad communist movement.    The regime was also racialist, and supremacist.  It was anti-Semetic in the technical sense of the word, meaning it held that Jews are a race, and an inferior race, and a race that had a quality that undermined the basic ideological notion of all nationalist movements, which is that a people are rooted  geographically.   The broad Jewish population, led by American Jews began a boycott of the Nazi regime.   </p>

<p>The Zionists were actively working on undermining it, so much so that they were importing German goods into Palestine, relabeling the products and sending them back into the global market. </p>

They are often called demons, but they are just ancient thieves that prefer to steal the very joy out of the hearts of others with pain and fear than to create and share value as we do. Why steal money or property if you can replicate them easily? </p>

<p>&quot;I do it all, because I&#39;m evil.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I do it all for free.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your tears are all the pay I&#39;ll ever need.&quot;</p>

<p>I caution people, these beings are real. I am attacked by them daily and know it for sure. You might achieve that by experiencing them and calling them out as frauds as I did, but know they will torment you until someone else restrains them, if ever. You can live life if you work harder at it, but the quality of life will still suffer greatly. Yes, this amounts to foreign thoughts and voices in my mind. They are in all of our minds, but that hasn&#39;t been revealed to all of us at this time. I am not the only one. I&#39;ve read many similar accounts, old and new. </p>

<p>I point this out, because they showed me over ten years of interactions some of their patterns. There is a most insidious one that works well on our species. They pretend to be light. Not all who call themselves light are these beings. No, they just find high utility in impersonation of what we trust. It helps them insert beliefs that elicit fear or suffering, which gets them high on our loosh. For you it could be angels or whatever else you believe. They know how to fabricate fiction using time tested models to control you with them. </p>

<p>They&#39;d imply they were benevolent ETs concerned about my spiritual development. Yet, they would repeatedly use truth (my failure to live up to personal goals I set) as pretexts to sell plausible deceptions about illusory consequences. They can get us to feel intense negative emotions by nesting themselves in our perspectives of divinity. They have no qualms about using God&#39;s image to cause fear, suffering and slavery.</p>

<p>This set of experiences leads me to believe that the assertions of some, that these beings run a fraudulent karma system after death, have a lot of merit. So many of our religions set us up for a scenario of divine judgment and punishment. For beings that feed on fear and pain, including guilt and torment caused by demonic beings (themselves), this is a wet dream. </p>

<p>Their slaves, their food, bow before them and submit to their authority and their punishment. They set themselves up for this using religion. Reptilians are involved. They match many myths of demons. They set themselves up to appear to be unstoppable demons in those religions, so we don&#39;t believe we can kill these pathogenic organisms. Yet, they are just ancient, spoiled, cowardly manchildren (irresponsible to others) that target the weak and young to steal their joy and then will flee and even betray their own when some powerful enough beings come to aid.</p>

<p>If we cut the foreign spiritual parasites out of our environment, their proxies, of which some Jews are a subset, will fail to maintain their deceptions and power. Their efficacy is heavily inflated by the expertise of their co-conspirators from <del>hell</del> <del>the heavens</del> space. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>After a while, the Jews of the world called a meeting in Amsterdam. Jews from every country in the world attended this meeting in July 1933. And they said to Germany: “You fire Hitler, and you put every Jew back into his former position, whether he was a Communist or no matter what he was. You can&#39;t treat us that way. And we, the Jews of the world, are serving an ultimatum upon you.” You can imagine what the Germans told them. So what did the Jews do? In 1933, when Germany refused to surrender to the world conference of Jews in Amsterdam, the conference broke up, and Mr. Samuel Untermyer, who was the head of the American delegation and the president of the whole conference, came to the United States and went from the steamer to the studios of the Columbia Broadcasting System and made a radio broadcast throughout the United States in which he in effect said,“The Jews of the world now declare a Holy War against Germany. We are now engaged in a sacred conflict against the Germans. And we are going to starve them into surrender. We are going to use a world-wide boycott against them. That will destroy them because they are dependent upon their export business.” And it is a fact that two thirds of Germany&#39;s food supply had to be imported, and it could only be imported with the proceeds of what they exported. So if Germany could not export, two thirds of Germany&#39;s population would have to starve. There was just not enough food for more than one third of the population. 
The boycott continued for some time, but it wasn&#39;t until 1938, when a young Jew from Poland walked into the German embassy in Paris and shot a German official, that the Germans really started to get rough with the Jews in Germany. And you found them then breaking windows and having street fights and so forth. Now I don&#39;t like to use the word “anti-Semitism” because it&#39;s meaningless, but it means something to you still, so I&#39;ll have to use it. The only reason that there was any feeling in Germany against Jews was that they were responsible for World War I and for this world-wide boycott.Ultimately they were also responsible for World War II, because after this thing got out of hand, it was absolutely necessary for the Jews and Germany to lock horns in a war to see which one was going to survive. </p>

<p>Prove me that everything described in this text actually happend. 
Also Germany allready went rough on the jews by 1936 after the Reichskristallnacht </p>

<p>You can read about it first hand in Margaret Macmillan&#39;s book: Paris 1919 - Six months that changed the world: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paris-1919-Months-Changed-World/dp/0375508260">https://www.amazon.com/Paris-1919-Months-Changed-World/dp/0375508260</a></p>

<p>The author is a Oxford University fellow, former provost, leading historian and great grand daughter of then UK Prime Minister - David Lloyd George. It&#39;s hard to find a more authoritative source</p>

<p>On the source you should listen to the entirety of Benjamin Freedman&#39;s speech here: <a href="https://archive.org/details/AJewishDefectorWarnsAmericaByBenjaminH.Freedman">https://archive.org/details/AJewishDefectorWarnsAmericaByBenjaminH.Freedman</a></p>

<p>Also the Reichskristallnacht occurred in 1938 - not 1936. So immediately following the assassination of Vom Rath and five years after this - <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Judea_Declares_War_on_Germany">http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Judea_Declares_War_on_Germany</a></p>

<p>But now we&#39;re getting into conspiracy theory and your mind might explode if I tell you that the Federal Reserve Act and 16th Amendment were passed by Woodrow Wilson before he committed the US into WWI thus fulfilling the UK&#39;s desperate terms that predicated the Balfour Treaty which was catalysed by the sinking of the Lusitania - whose route was directed through disputed waters and telegraphed to German U-Boat positions via Room 40. </p>

<p>To understand the modern day impact of these decisions please check who owns the almighty interest on the US National Debt as backed by future US taxpayers. </p>

<p>In 1936 my grandparents names were printed in some Nazi gazette that they are no longer citizens of Germany because they were Jewish.  It was strange because he was a decorated German veteran of WW1 as a medical doctor working on the front lines, as were numerous other Jewish German citizens who were the most decorated and loyal group within the army.  The reality they faced was increasing racism and scapegoating against them for the hyperinflation of the 1930&#39;s.  Times were tough and european history from 1000 to 1945 always had the same group of people to blame.  The family-owned factories and properties were confiscated starting in 1937 and they had to leave.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying Facebook is evil because of Jew.  It&#39;s not because shareholders need more profits and the board of directors need more profits. Certainly Facebook is too liberal and biased, like many companies, but that&#39;s a political discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but does America get to call shotgun for Canada?</p>

<p>Do the descendants of Judea get to call shotgun for Israel?</p>

<p>If you want to invoke your Bible as some sort of claim, then it bears pointing out that the ten tribes (that constituted Israel) were broken up in 800 BC and scattered. PBS had a documentary on some of the missing tribes ending up in Uzbekistan . . . which makes sense, since they were carried east into Persia and ended up in Central Asia. </p>

<p>These were NOT the groups who went west into Europe.</p>

<p>They remained east. In studying these tribes in Uzbekistan, they noted that they don&#39;t refer to themselves as &quot;Jews&quot;. They refer to themselves as &quot;Israelites&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;Jews are from Judea. We&#39;re not from Judea,&quot; they explained (reasonably enough).</p>

<p>So the Zionists in Europe are not related to these people. They&#39;re descended from Judea.</p>

<p>So I ask you again: Do the descendants pf Judea get to call shotgun for Israel?</p>

<p>It&#39;s people of French extraction claiming to reconstitute Germany. (From an outsider&#39;s perspective, it&#39;s bizarre.)</p>
