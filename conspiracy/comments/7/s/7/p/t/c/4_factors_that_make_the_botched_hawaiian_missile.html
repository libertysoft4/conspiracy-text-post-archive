        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Got one for you around the botched Hawaiian missile alert. 4 different factors make this story terrifying.</p>

<p>1.) Intelihub confirmed that a NBC crew was spotted inside the missile bunker (where the button is pressed) hours before the alert went out. When interrogated, the news crew said they were swimming outside their hotel, but after pictures emerged of them inside the bunker, they admitted they were in fact inside but the timing was just a coincidence. Link here: <a href="https://www.intellihub.com/confirmed-nbc-news-crew-spotted-inside-bunker-that-sent-hawaii-missile-alert-just-hours-before/">https://www.intellihub.com/confirmed-nbc-news-crew-spotted-inside-bunker-that-sent-hawaii-missile-alert-just-hours-before/</a></p>

<p>2.) Reports claim that it was a simple error where a technician accidentally pressed the wrong button. They even went a step beyond to release a picture of the supposed moron who activated the alert, with his activation password postit noted to his desktop... Reports came out that it is a known fact that these missile alert systems are required to have a 5 step sequenced process ending with a two person double key turn to activate the alert. How could one person &quot;accidentally&quot; click the wrong button?</p>

<p>3.) ~50 people have come forward including a Hawaiian tourist boat company saying they saw a large explosion over the ocean. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhto4f-NiQs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhto4f-NiQs</a></p>

<p>4.) Just a few days later- a similar alert goes off in Japan... And they again say it was an accident.</p>

<p>What do you all think? Was it a mistake? Was it a test to see how civilians will respond to a missile threat? Or was there an actual missile that was shot down?</p>

<p>Nobody wants a war. Therefore the ruling party must either con the people (Pearl Harbour) or condition them (TSA in Airports) to accept a war like society. The economy is shattered. This government shutdown is proof. Also there is a major power play going on that Trump is only <em>partly</em> winning. War is coming and this little Alert stunt is only the start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of hypotheses go through my head.
1) Provoke a response from the US - starting a war.
2) Provoke a response from the US - to make Trump look stupid.  Don&#39;t discount this one, there are folks out there who would literally nuke an American city if they thought the end result would get Trump out of office.  In their mind they are Patriots protecting us from a greater evil.
3) Distract while &#39;something else&#39; took place.  You could pull off a lot of shit out in the open broad daylight while everyone is running for their lives to hide after a missile alert.</p>

<p>Once, maybe. Twice, in two countries (both said to be in reach of North Korea) and both within a few days? No, that is not a &quot;mistake&quot;. That is evil politics at work and using the population as political pawns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not a conspiracy theorist, however I tried to make this assertion and was downvoted to oblivion outside this sub. </p>

<p>I worked in law enforcement and directly with IT near a nuclear facility. We had these computers, we called them “bat phone computers” they had one SINGLE purpose and were NEVER touched. Once a month a few members of the military would come in and run maintenance on the system and its backup. It was on a special generator all by itself. </p>

<p>The fact that they are passing this off as a button you can click right beside the “amber alert” system is 100% complete lie. In fact, even issuing something like an amber alert is way more than that. You have to go through manually key in a bunch of info so it’s not done by accident.</p>

<p>My belief is the missile was real and it was shot down. They are keeping us in the dark to prevent panic/potentially prepare for an invasion. </p>

<p>You place too much trust in the abilities of the US Military. Shooting down an incoming missile is possible in theory. But the reality is quite different. Actual battle conditions, in Israel, have shown this. That said, I do think that there is far more to this story then is being publicly known.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily.  If knowledge of the missile attack would provoke war (and with the wrong country), I can absolutely see it remaining completely hush hush.  I tend to think if it was a missile attack, it didn&#39;t come from NK or Iran.  Probably came from somebody else trying to make it look like it came from NK or Iran to provoke a response.  What if that somebody else is Israel/US traitors/UK/France/get the picture.....  Keep it quiet while we deal with the rogue SOB&#39;s.  Might never know the truth.  FYI, I also think this &#39;alert&#39; is just as likely to have been a hack with the same intention of provoking a response.  I don&#39;t buy into the accident story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lack of recorded evidence could be explained by the explosion happening too fast for anyone to get their camera out. Also, if there was an explosion I&#39;d be more concerned about getting to safety than filming.</p>

<p>As to why those 50 witnesses aren&#39;t all on television sharing their story, who knows? I could see a lot of people not wanting to, but out of 50 there should be at least one who&#39;d want to share the story. Maybe the news station won&#39;t believe them without the corroboration of the other witnesses, but it having been on a tour boat none of the witnesses know each other and so the one who tried couldn&#39;t get in contact with the others?</p>

<p>So, why didn&#39;t any of the witnesses post their story online themselves? Maybe one/some of them did, but OP simply hasn&#39;t come across it?</p>

<p>The story could easily be made up. But the lack of evidence by itself doesn&#39;t prove this guy is lying.</p>

<p>If one wanted to figure it out, they could go through this guy&#39;s YouTube channel and try to make a determination as to whether he&#39;s full of it or tends to be forthright and honest, and use that to help make a judgment as to the odds that he&#39;s being truthful or not now.</p>

Thats the problem with the NSA, they dont collect some information, they collect EVERYTHING and they had to build a infrastructure with choke points to be able to scan everything. And on a side note, then use computer intelligence to find the things they are interested in, and im sure the little bit we know about machine learning available to the public is probably just the tip of what these things are capable of. </p>

<p>Yeah, they managed to scrub most of the videos of the &quot;aerial exercises&quot; a few months ago, remember when people thought they seen a huge craft flying across 3 or 4 states.

    <div class="md"><p>I’m particularly interested in this rabbit hole because I know you do your research properly.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen any evidence for nuclear weapons that you think looks somewhat credible?</p>

<p>I’ve seen many videos that purport to be nuclear detonations. They look pretty convincing to me, but what do I know. Right?</p>

<p>Basically, I’m curious to know why you apparently deem nukes a “hoax” when, if such a (classified) weapon did exist, any ‘evidence’ in the public domain would surely be misinformation anyway... such is the nature of ‘classified’ things, that knowledge of them must never be allowed to leak.</p>

<p>Is it the physics of nukes that convinces you they must be fake? What was the tipping point for this particular topic?</p>

<p>Nope. The archival footage is clearly fake, and even the underlying &#39;science&#39; is obviously silly, once you take the time to study it for yourself.</p>

<p>A good place to start down this rabbit hole is Rae West&#39;s <a href="http://www.big-lies.org/">nuke lies</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a visual learner, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHjohmgOh2M">this video</a> is sensational. If you can pay attention to it, you will not be the same by the end of the presentation.</p>

<p>I am absolutely aware of the fact that some of the nuclear test footage we have been shown is bullshit, but most of it looks very genuine.</p>

<p>Just my own personal take on it.  I wouldn&#39;t consider myself an expert but I studied film/media production and stuff like this simply wasn&#39;t in the cards for a 50&#39;s film crew, even with government funding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Op, think about it... if someone had the goal of trying to hack our first-strike detection to deactivate it, where would they start?  Maybe a fake missile alarm?  Maybe to make all the NORAD systems light up on the grid?  Hawaii is probably a pretty good target isn’t it?  <em>This</em> is what happened, and the “accident” and lack of sanctions or retaliation means we <em>are still trying to figure out who did it and how it was done</em>...  sleep well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you not even read your CNN article past URL?</p>

<p>&quot;Japanese <strong>broadcaster</strong> apologizes after false North Korea missile alert&quot;</p>

<p>It was a canned response that the news organization pushed to its app. Its like when a celebs or notable person&#39;s canned obituary gets posted. It would be like AP sending a bulletin to their app based on a US govt release. What happened in Hawaii was an official release through government maintained notification channels. The same ones that deliver amber alerts, weather notifications etc. Thats why in the article it says NHK subscribers. Not japanese people.</p>

<p>You other examples are not good either. Try harder my friend, a little thinking goes a long way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree - but can you really accept this degree of coincidence.  To me it looks like the hackers were only able to activate certain systems in each &#39;attack&#39;.  Example, in Hawaii the sirens did not sound, but they did get the commercial systems (TV and Cell phones) to activate.  In Japan appears they only got the TV broadcast to activate - which sent alerts to phones with the NHK app.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep saying this.  They are different but similar. </p>

<p>Similar - A missile alert was ‘sounded’
Similar - A missile alert was not sounded across all systems that should happen in the event of a missile alert.</p>

<p>Hawaii, Emergency Broadcast System and commercial EAS system was triggered.  Sirens were not.</p>

<p>Japan - NHK  (Japan’s national public broadcasting system) issued an alert to users of their phone app.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/16/asia/japan-false-missile-alarm-intl/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/16/asia/japan-false-missile-alarm-intl/index.html</a></p>

<p>The only difference I see is the scope of the alert.  Both are claimed to be ‘mistakes’. NHK sent correction quicker than in Hawaii.</p>

<p>Bottom line, 1 day apart, hard to swallow as mistakes.  My best guess is hacks which were more successful in Hawaii. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My buddy thinks this is the most logical. There&#39;s no way that it was an accident and took them more than 30 minutes to respond to it. At least the Japan one was recalled in a few minutes.</p>

<p>The other thing I could think of is there was an actual missile, but I think we would have much more evidence of that if it were true, so hacking seems the most likely to me.</p>
