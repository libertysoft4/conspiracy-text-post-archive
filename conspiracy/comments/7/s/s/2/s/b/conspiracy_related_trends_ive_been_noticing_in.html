        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some of things being <em>Romanticized</em> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/12/19/titanic-20th-anniversary-10-reasons-why-it-remains-the-biggest-film-ever-7128207/">20th Anniversary of Titanic The Movie</a>. The Titanic, of course, is surrounded in conspiracy, whether you believe it was <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3n5gmy">Switched with the Olympic in an insurance scam</a> or it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic_alternative_theories">Cover for Pushing through the Federal Reserve</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lucifer+tv+series&amp;amp;oq=lucifer+tv+ser&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l3.5612j0j7&amp;amp;client=ms-android-americamovil-us&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">Lucifer</a> is the lead character in a new show on Fox where he works directly with the LAPD. &quot;Lucifer&quot; is of course just another name for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">Satan</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Strong">12 Strong</a> focuses on the war effort after the <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/">9/11 Attacks</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now here are some things being treated as <em>Jokes</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Illuminati, it&#39;s being used heavily in the most recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLa4miaiXIA">Taco Bell Ad Campaign</a></p></li>
<li><p>The Mandela Effect is the focus of tonight&#39;s <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS778US778&amp;amp;q=mandela+effect+x+files&amp;amp;spell=1&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ5s_z8fHYAhUJ7VMKHebJAqwQBQgkKAA&amp;amp;biw=1216&amp;amp;bih=766">X-Files Episode</a>. If it&#39;s anything like the rest of the season thus far, it&#39;ll be bull shit.</p></li>
<li><p>Pizzagate, was the title of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtvChallenge/comments/7smc3k/the_positivesilver_lining_to_pizzagate/">this week&#39;s episode of MTV&#39;s &quot;The Challenge&quot;</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think there&#39;s definitely some brainwashing going on here. It seems like the stuff they <em>Romanticize</em> is the stuff they want you to keep close to your heart; so you build an emotional connection with these stories. As we all know, when emotions take over, it&#39;s often very difficult for logic to change someone&#39;s stance. As for the things that are put in a more <em>Joking</em> like light, I believe it&#39;s an attempt to start a mindset along the lines of, &quot;That was a joke on TV, it&#39;s not real!&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m anxious to see what the other takes on this are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;ve been outspoken and irritated since the very beginning that Pedogate &amp; Pizzagate were becoming intertwined - and personally I think it was a meta-conspiracy to discredit elite pedo claims.  I absolutely believe something like Pedogate is happening.  The Franklin Conspiracy, Hollywood abuses, that Seville guy in the UK - but Pizzagate?  I think that was a fire started to discredit all the other real claims that were threatening to come to light.</p>
