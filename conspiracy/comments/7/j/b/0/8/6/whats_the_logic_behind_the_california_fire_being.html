Beyond these ideas sounding ridiculous to me, what is the logic behind these theories? Who stands to gain anything by destroying a chunk of California?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this. And it is suspicious when you get people coming in here placing doubt on peoples conspiracies. Anyone who lives in California will tell you these fires are suspicious. Including myself.</p>

<p>These fires are suspicious, yes, we get wildfires, but these are something else.</p>

<p>Yes there is lot of fuel for them, but they are all in separate places, separated by hundreds of miles, they all started at about the same time, they caught a PERSON DRESSED ALL IN BLACK trying to start another one in orange county, and well, you need a spark or a flame to start any fire. </p>

<p>In the past it is usually a thunderstorm. We haven&#39;t had any storms in a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it sounds ridiculous, weather modification is an established fact.  How powerful that modification is is open to debate.  Control?  Influence?  Do they make the hurricane or merely direct it?</p>

<p>Direct energy weapons are also somewhat established, so while sounding ridiculous, their existence and use is accepted as (more or less) reality.</p>

<p>So, the &quot;logic behind the theories&quot; is (more or less) established for those who frequent these topics.</p>

<p>Whether those were applied here or not is the question.  I am leaning towards Yes due to the bizarrely high temp reached and the &quot;Amazingly Persistent High Pressure System&quot; off the coast of California, plus HAARPs presence in Alaska.</p>

<p>I&#39;m less sure of motive but I rarely try and imagine I can imagine all possible motives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possible Why&#39;s:</p>

<p>The NorCal Napa/Sonoma fires covered a lot of known CIA/New Age properties.  Things like the Esalen Institute.  Two years ago, Harbin Hot Springs was torched in a similar matter.  The Harbin fire may have been a test run.  In SoCal, the Bel Air fire covered the Getty Museum, and the Getty&#39;s are often rumored about in the pedo world.</p>

<p>The CIA and US Military may be having turf wars, and the military struck a key CIA power center (NorCal) and key CIA power players (those affected by SoCal fires).</p>

<p>I do not believe any marijuana related motives for these fires.  None of the burned areas were major grows.  Those grows are a county or two north of Napa/Sonoma.</p>

<p>Geo-engineering:  California is a sacrificial lamb to protect the rest of the US and the fertile central plains.  This would explain the &quot;Persistently Present High Pressure System&quot; off Cali&#39;s coast.  Basically, those with the ability have decided California&#39;s weather can be manipulated for the benefit of the rest of the country.</p>

<p>Economy:  They&#39;re attacking high property value areas in order to create economies that benefit them (redevelopment, etc).  Or pushing people out of upper-class rural living and into the cities.  Something along those lines for profit and social engineering.</p>
