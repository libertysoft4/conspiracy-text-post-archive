    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If he did then why are they waiting until now to say something?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In most cases they didn&#39;t -- pretty much all of these women told the people around them about the assaults, and in many cases these other people have come forward to corroborate the stories.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do people wait so long after the fact to say anything?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, they didn&#39;t, they pretty much all immediately told their close friends and family about the assaults.</p>

<p>But what else would you expect?  Say Donald Trump, a famous celebrity, gropes you at a party, or pushes you against a wall and tries to kiss you.  What are you realistically going to do?  A stranger sexually assaulting you without physical injury, when that person isn&#39;t your boss, etc., isn&#39;t worth a whole lot in a civil suit.  You almost certainly won&#39;t recover more than the cost of suit.  It&#39;s also not a crime the police are likely to care much about, because in the end it&#39;s basically he said/she said.  The Weinstein story and its history should be proof positive about how useless coming forward with real allegations has been up until this last month.</p>

<p>And on the other side, you have your life gets turned upside down for years and become a target of tabloids and people trying to discredit you.  If you meet a nice guy at a party and start dating, do you want the first thing they see when they google your name to be, &quot;ACCUSED DONALD TRUMP OF GROPING HER AT PARTY.&quot;  Of course not, you probably just want it to go away and not see the man again.  </p>

<p>Women aren&#39;t stupid, they&#39;re not going to bring a gigantic hassle into their lives knowing that it&#39;ll almost certainly have no effect on anything.</p>

<p>That changes, however, when your attacker suddenly looks poised to take the White House.  Now it&#39;s not just your own life, it&#39;s the country at stake, and you can&#39;t escape your attacker just by avoiding him.  At that point, you would see it as a public duty to end your silence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only people I have seen cover this are liberal news stations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because you&#39;re probably defining &quot;liberal news stations&quot; as any outlet that doesn&#39;t slavishly defend Donald Trump.  Plenty of conservatives are disgusted by his behavior.</p>

He has been to Epsteins mossad sex island and provided Virginia Roberts from his own stash of kids at paedo lago. He is definitely a sexual predator on the same level as Bill Clinton. Thats how he got the backing of Zionists like Murdoch </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The evidence would already be everywhere. </p>

<p>Trump is a fucking billionaire, all he has to do is get a REAL model into the show business, she sleeps with an old blond fart and he gets to nut in a hotty, and then she gets a 50k payout and a business opportunity she already slept with someone for, she gets her feet in the door and if she herself is capable as a model, survives the business etc etc. </p>

<p>This happens more than people think. No one was assaulted, Trump seems like the type of guy who would get the shit beat out of him by a tiny mouse women who&#39;s ass he tried to stick a finger in. &quot;SECURITY, SHE&#39;S BEATING ME!&quot;. </p>

<p>All in all, if there was anything, it would already be used against him, look at how hard people are trying. </p>

<p>Every thread that tries to pretend these accusations is cold hard proof, they all act like its a smoking gun, its honestly straight fucking retarded at this point. </p>

<p>Lets not even talk about pornstars, there are japanese pornstars who are sitting here going: &quot;I have had gelatin enemas, milk enemas, tentacle enemas, fist enemas, etc, and I never bitched and complained about being assaulted, I got payed.&quot;</p>

<p>If you had the Kryptonite to take down the good/bad guy (idc what you think he is tbh), and if your the vise versa of what he is, wouldn&#39;t you use the kryptonite as soon as possible to take down the hero/bad guy? </p>

<p>Yeah. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they built up their strawman via the Weinstein Effect and hope this will bring him down. They realize that Trump will bring both the Dem and Rep Establishment down and they don&#39;t want that. They are grasping at straws at this point. I believe he used to be pervy - I mean that was well known. But I see him now and I really do think he has the country&#39;s best interest in mind. The alternative is much scarier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think he&#39;s 100% a rapist. He brags about groping women by the vag. He brags about barging in on naked teenagers at his pageants. He&#39;s the TV superstar. Heck, he ticks ALL the boxes for Hollywood pedo elite. Anybody who promotes pizzagate but defends Trump is a fake conspiracy theorist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup that&#39;s why Bill Gates and Warren buffet have dozens of women accusing then of rape. It&#39;s also why we have allegedly fake audio of them bragging about assaulting women and walking into the changing rooms of underage models. Happens to everyone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must be young. When Clinton was president it was all the &quot;MSM&quot; talked about. Remember he got impeached for lying about a consenual blow job.</p>

<p>Trump is also accused of forcible rape, one of them was 12 the other was 13</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I havent heard any accusations of grabbing genitals. While I think allegations should be taken seriously, I&#39;m not sure allegations are enough for someone to have to step down. If that were the case nobody would be safe </p>
