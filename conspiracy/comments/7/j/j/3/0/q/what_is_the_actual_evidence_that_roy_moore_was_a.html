Is America at the point right now that winning a Senate seat is more important than paedophilia? Are these allegations going to keep appearing from 25+ years in the past right as elections occur, then disappear? How are you allowed to accuse people of crimes in the media and not follow through with it with the law?</p>

<p>Btw I&#39;m not even American. It&#39;s just that the front page of Reddit has become a cesspool of lefty politics and shills in the past 2 years. Impossible to avoid this stuff.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nearly impossible to find any neutral fact based evidence.</p>

<p>The accusations, in their volume, were enough in this case to tip the balance of public opinion that an alleged child abuser shouldn&#39;t be elevated to the Senate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(If every accusation ever made has to be officially debunked, then this country is done.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that, I&#39;m just saying that it can&#39;t be written off as &quot;fake news&quot; just because it doesn&#39;t have physical proof. Just like it can&#39;t be considered a fact without real world eveidence. The jury is still out on this one. </p>

<p>However, my biggest hang-up on dismissing this story completely is that one of the main sources for this rumor was apparently a high ranking politician that had experience working with Moore in Alabama. And (before this election) there were not many high ranking Democrats working in Alabama, so most likely a fellow Republican confirmed the story to the press off the record.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s tons of circumstantial evidence. He hit on (and fucked) very young girls all the time. Someone aged 14 at the time accused him. Tons of professional who worked around him or in the same circles confirmed that there were rumours throughout his adult life that he pursued sex with underage girls. These rumours predate any serious political aspirations on his part. So, a) there seems to me to be enough of a preponderance of circumstantial evidence to assume he probably did these things and b) it would be impossible to ever say the same about me because I&#39;m never done anything remotely similar to what he&#39;s accused of.</p>
