        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Almost every politician is either really fucking stupid or outright subhuman. They sit back and allow America and other nations to basically carve up the middle east for financial gain, murder hundreds of thousands, and continue the enslavement of humanity through owning most of the capital and financial institutions (well the wealthy do more than politicians) . And we sit here doing nothing. Imagine being born in Afghanistan, a fresh soul with no religious affiliation, no concept of anything, to being born into a country being fucking destroyed by people you don&#39;t know. Look around you. Look up from your phone or screen and look around you. Most of us live in worlds those people could only dream of and all that had to happen was sheer luck. We could have been born anywhere and yet we weren&#39;t born into these living hells of suffering. And that suffering goes on. For what? Literally for what? And what do we do? Nothing. We let it happen. We sit here and we post shit and we spread information largely only to those who already wanted to hear it. Anyone else just tunes out. It&#39;s a fucking joke. </p>

I’ve lost friends because I tried to open their minds and wake them up, I wasn’t aggressive about it, just open conversations. 
Only those who want to wake do so, and usually on their own terms. I realized that it is not my duty to try and wake others up at the expense of my time, energy, and happiness. 
I still talk to those that want to listen but they are few and far between. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We must withdraw our energy from the systems of the enemy.  We must demolish the temples of Molech, Baal and the black cube.
We will flee the cities and break up into small tribes that spread out across the earth settling in key positions along major vortex points. We will have wild mushroom fueled orgies for weeks on end and by the time we come down, the archons will be dead and we may ascend out of the matrix.</p>

<p>I think it’s at least worth a shot. We can always come back to hell if it’s not effective! </p>

<p>But seriously....We must understand that our problems stem from a spiritual sickness. Once we heal our spiritual bodies, options will begin to unfold!!</p>
