        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This video goes over a theory that Paddock was an FBI informant. In short he suggests the sting went wrong and he was killed by the men he was supposed to be dealing with, who then performed the terrorism and left the scene amid the chaos.   </p>

<p>I suggest watching it 1.5X speed. Like a lot of YouTubers he seems to be just getting his barings in making videos and there are quite a few pauses. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aPKpnBA-Ebo">https://youtu.be/aPKpnBA-Ebo</a></p>

<p>Ive been following this story quite a lot. When it stopped making sense to me was the lack of footage of Paddock entering the hotel. This is something that has become routine to see on any major news story so what makes this special? Even if its just still images of him entering the building - they should be here.</p>

<p>Then you have no motive. He just got bored and decided to rent a room to gun down innocnet civillians? That doesn&#39;t really fit with his character profile. Incredibly wealthy. High roller gambler. He must be very intelligent to be able to make a living off of gambling.  </p>

<p>Then you have all that hilariously hard to believe Jesus Campos drama. The multiple gunmen being heavily refuted despite multiple witness testimony. It just doesn&#39;t make sense.  </p>

<p>Theres a YouTuber &quot;End Times News Report&quot; which Ive seen posted on here that is also worth following. His investigation is going in a slightly different direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My main problem with all the theories of arms deals is Paddock would of been selling legal weapons, so you don&#39;t need him at all. You just need a few strawman buyers in Arizona. A state that is only a few hours from Vegas with zero waiting period for long guns or any real limits on buying them. So couple of buyers, three different gun stores and you&#39;re done. You also don&#39;t need your arms dealer to lug up pounds and pounds of ammo to the room being you can go to an random sporting good store and load up. </p>

<p>Plus with all the guns there odds are that would of been the final money for arms trade etc. So the FBI, if he was FBI, would have tactical stacked up and ready to go in another room. Never mind there is no reason to even reach the level of guns in the room being conspiracy to commit already carries some huge penalties. </p>

<p>Even if all of that is over looked and lets say something did go side ways in a deal. All the buyers have to do is walk away. Either it&#39;s a sting and tactical is waiting and in that case shooting at the crowd gains you nothing, being tactical would be next door anyways. If no one was waiting then just walk. Why put the entire city on lock down by causing a huge event like thing to happen? I mean clearly at this point none of us know anything but I really do find the conspiracy of arms sales to just be filled with way too many logic leaps. </p>

<p>as for the rest of it, it&#39;s mostly been covered in past post but people just don&#39;t like the answers. No video being it&#39;s an active investigation and feds have zero pressure to produce anything. Plus they locked out local PD right away and local tends to be where leaks come from being local PD know local reporters.  Muti-shooter issue depends on where one says they were at really. From a distance? Maybe? On the ground shooting at other casino floors? Yet no one is shot, no one has come forward? Little harder to believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea is that he is selling weapons that he legally possesses, to foreign entities. Thus removing background checks and clearanace periods. He would be the guy in charge of the strawmen? Perhaps itd be far cheaper and more secure to use one supllier than 3?      </p>

<p>However I do see the logic of the rest of what you say. If its a sting FBI should be all over it in a heartbeat. The YouTuber explains it away in saying its recon, and trying to establish a relationship than anything else. But I think your logic makes more sense.    </p>

<p>Interestingly &quot;End Times News Report&quot; has said that he thinks Paddock was a gun runner, and uses Paddocks rented car records and flights as evidence to support that he was at least running something. But End Times* has not claimed that it was a sting of any sort, nor that Paddock was related to the FBI.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>modern conspiracy theories seem to suffer from Dr Evil like over complications. Where people feel the need to work in a terror group, a few black bag ops, a high ranking political move, maybe some stock market manipulations and so on. My own &quot;Inception&quot; like conspiracy theory OF conspiracy theories is that over complication is done for monetary reasons. To drive more web and video hits being boring theories don&#39;t get views. </p>

<p>being back in the day a good conspiracy theory would be something like Jack and Jill really went up the hill to poison the well. Then Jill shoved Jack down the hill when he would fallow up through with the plan. Now? Now Jack has to be an agent of Aesop and working to bring about the tortoise&#39;s grand plan to kill all Hare&#39;s before they can find out the real race results. Being Tortoise vs Hare was really just a gov plot to turn tortoises into soup. </p>

<p>So you don&#39;t like to believe them because they&#39;re too complicated for you...got it. If it isn&#39;t straight forward and black &amp; white we are just crazy cooks for showing any interest.</p>

<p>the Rube Goldberg machine like nature of some conspiracies is not the reason people are skeptical. The issue is some want their theories to be taken at face value while simultaneously trying to ignore huge holes in core logic. </p>

<p>To keep it in the range of Vegas a good example is a 2nd shooter narrative about dark figures moving up on what was said to be an RV roof. How did they get up there!? </p>

<p>All while over looking photos of the location in the day light shows a semi-permanent building on the grounds with stairs on both sides. So we can either go with a super complicated why is anyone up there theory or we can go with &quot;they took the stairs&quot;. Same for saying Vegas was a sting gone wrong, as if local or federal would not have a tactical team stacked and ready to go if it was a sting. </p>

<p>theories are becoming lazy about stuff like that for some reason. My own personal theory is, as I said, that it&#39;s due to trying to rush out content for youtube or websites for the clicks. People see/read the click bait and then just parrot it back. Everyone over looking the effort side of it. That&#39;s why I like the huge write up posted here how it was an assassination attempt, being at least the person put in effort. I don&#39;t agree with the theory, but I can appreciate and enjoy the effort they put into their theory.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I feel something weird is going on here. But, it could be as simple as the withholding of information is due to massive screw-ups by the FBI/LVMPD/SWAT and Mandalay Bay. They are afraid of hundreds of lawsuits. </p>

<p>The other one I can see is Paddock being involved with a criminal element. Not necessarily selling guns. No mercenaries, extra shooters. Only due to his connection with Adam Katschke. But, I still feel this may be too complicated. But, I do have many questions regarding some of the unexplainable. Especially the adjoining door being locked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a very real possibility. No FBI involved. Paddock was a criminal who just got involved with other criminals (foreign or domestic). Perhaps tricked by mercenaries, not sure if I can swallow that one yet. But, with his ties to Katschke, he does have a definite criminal past. Not to mention the weird trips and the interview with the Uber driver testifying to relationships like this. </p>

<p>Perhaps I&#39;m a little too apprehensive about buying into the less analytical theories. But, I&#39;m definitely open to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, The multitude of guns and ammo could be to just establish Paddock’s credibility. Everything about his lifestyle and family history, gambler, rich, dad a criminal,  screams cover story and adds to his credibility. Something about the whole thing stinks, and whether a gun deal gone wrong or a setup for the assassination of a Saudi Prince, the truth is being withheld.</p>
