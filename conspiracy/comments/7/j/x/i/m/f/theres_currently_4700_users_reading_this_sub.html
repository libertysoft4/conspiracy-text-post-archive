    <div class="md"><p>Ya, that was the average in my estimation. I remember when it bumped up over 7k the first time several months ago. But regulars knew we were in for some shit if it got over 3k or so. Weird thing about the big bumps, like 7 and 10k+, we always expected something terrible to happen, and it never did. So, I dunno if the shill nation were using this to psyche us out or what, but it was odd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they have definitely started developing their online game. each of their false flags or fake news stories is a way for them to evaluate us</p>

<p>they are sophisticated enough to fake the Ferguson riots and Michael Brown shooting, and to also make it appear as if it began as an online story that was being ignored by the media. </p>

<p>the first i heard of Ferguson was by a slickly-produced video put out by &quot;Anonymous&quot; that was suspiciously available even before Michael Brown had assumed room temperature </p>

<p>then later, the media &quot;reluctantly&quot; (wink wink) covers the story as all of the un-ruley and un-lawful black people destroy the small commercial district that was already slated to be razed and rebuilt. </p>

<p>same thing happened with WTC 1 and WTC 2</p>

<p>they planned to tear down the buildings and redevelop the property, so they fabricate a wild tale about brown and black people behaving badly </p>

<p>one thing these shills do, preemptively, is to roll into a forum like reddit or twitter, and to search for certain keywords that would likely be put out by someone who would also talk about the next false flag, and have those people suspended. </p>

<p>my twitter account got suspended right before the boston marathon bombings, by a troll who went on to be what we called &quot;boston trolls&quot;. they preemptively silenced me. the suspension was short -lived that time, but eventually i got permanently banned </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was always a subscriber but I started commenting and reading on a daily basis once Las Vegas went down, and as that was starting to dry up, them Storm clouds calmly began rolling in. I now read New multiple times per day and usually at the end of the day start checking hot and top. I love this place and that wasn’t always the case. So idk maybe to a certain extent some of this is genuine? Then again the constant rolling in of defenses of Bob Mueller and attacks on the fact that someone question a msm or government narrative is attacked. Weird for this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh there is organic growth for sure. But these were huge fluctuations. It would go from 3k-7/10k, and then <em>back down</em>. My pet theory is reputation management ment software links a controller browser to hundreds of slaved account sessions. Normally, they disconnect that shit unless they are voting on something. But sometimes they would get lazy or forget, and leave all those sessions connected and actively pointed at this subreddit, inflating the user count.</p>

<p>I&#39;m kinda dying to know if that is true at all, if any shills want to confirm lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but the amount of users online right now (12:21 AM EDT) is far above average (remember, the majority of Reddit users are from the US). </p>

<p>I&#39;m personally ~4 hours behind (EDT) on the far West Coast of the US, and am usually on this time of night. What I said, is personal observation over the years. Shit, I remember when ~500 &quot;users here&quot; was odd.</p>

<p>Anyways, like I said, it&#39;s probably the NN shit show...</p>

I now read New multiple times per day and usually at the end of the day start checking hot and top. I love this place and that wasn’t always the case. So idk maybe to a certain extent some of this is genuine?
