    <div class="md"><p>I admit I can&#39;t prove anything. It&#39;s a theory. Why I post in r/conspiracy not r/news. Then with all the speed cameras and security cameras not working no one can say anything beyond reasonable doubt regarding Diana death, whether it be an accident or murder. </p>

<p>Yes if Diana had worn a seatbelt, she would not have suffered the injuries she suffered. No argument whatsoever. Still even with minor injuries the ambulance would have been required and that is the really suspicious and strange part of her death. I think that is where she was killed or more probable finished off. </p>

<p>Can  say with Martin Luther King Jr their are allegations (which I believe as credible) that King survived gunshots in Memphis but was killed by a doctor in operating theatre. This doctor cleared the operating theatre and killed the great man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the ambulance where Diana was killed. The ambulance stopping like it did is strange -and the ambulance would have been called regardless of seat belts being worn and so the trip would have happened, and cardiac arrest still have occured. Spoken to nurses while working at a hospital and most found that trip to hospital and ambulance stopping the way it did strange. </p>

<p>Prove it no. Why I&#39;m posting in r/conspiracy</p>

<p>It has been alleged that Martin Luther King Jnr may have been killed by a doctor

<p>As for a hundred facts about Diana death I don&#39;t know as I have never counted. Just many amazing happenstances that will stop people ever knowing the truth - like a whole series of speed cams and security cams that would have shed light on the whole mess all not working on the night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have watched, read looked and used common sense. So many of the factors that lead to the death of Di where in the hands of the people in the car. And to try and implicate those trying to save her life is misleading and without evidence. Without question some mistakes were made. But made because of her injuries and concern about stabilising her before moving her. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah he lingered for a few days, however the murdered at the hospital theory is weak as fuck.  Bleeding often leads to death.  My descending aorta was torn in a car wreck luckily my own odd blood was on hand for another surgery planned for a week after the wreck.  I arrested twice and spent two weeks in a coma.Point is if given o universal donor blood my body probably goes into shock and shuts the rest of the way down rather than recuperating.</p>
