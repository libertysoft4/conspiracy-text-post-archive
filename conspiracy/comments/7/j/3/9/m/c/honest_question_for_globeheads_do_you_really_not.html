<p>What I see is the tip of his little finger catching the edge of the other guy&#39;s pocket.</p>

<p>I see no evidence at all of a cable.</p>

<p>In fact... it is impossible that a cable could be attached where the video claims. Watch the microphone cable. That black cable would have to pass <em>through</em> the supposed harness cable when the astronaut does his flip.</p>

<p>TL:DR; You proved nothing other than the astronaut is <em>not</em> wearing a harness suspended from cables.</p>

<p>Neither the microphone cable nor his leg hit any sort of invisible harness cable, so the existence of that cable is utterly disproved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there are uncut clips of the astronuts on the &quot;ISS&quot; which are longer than ten minutes, they are suspended from wires. In some clips you can see the wires making their shirts protrude, but if you fast forward the videos you also see them bouncing around, sometimes to the same &quot;rhythm&quot; as if they are suspended from the same mechanism. You also will notice that they never move around each other as this would tangle the wires. All they can do is their stupid little somersaults in place. </p>

<p>The dangers of being aboard such a craft begin to pile up when you take a minute to brainstorm about it.   The simple issue of human hair and dust poses a huge problem that is nowhere near adequately addressed. And the women float around with their hair by shaved or covered by a cap, using copious hair spray to simulate weightlessness. It&#39;s absurd!</p>
