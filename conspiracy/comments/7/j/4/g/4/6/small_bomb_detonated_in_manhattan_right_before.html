    <div class="md"><p>I think it will blow over in less than 24 hrs and isn&#39;t that significant. The Port Authority bus terminal NY is the largest in the country. Real damage could have been done. But this idiot was so inept he couldn&#39;t even kill himself.</p>

<p>My theory, is that this is going to be used to increase bus terminal security. Currently, you can get anywhere in the country, without flashing an ID once, if you buy a greyhound ticket. It&#39;s known as the poor mans airplane for a reason. They don&#39;t want anonymous public travel, I think they will use this to start treating bus terminals like airports, and start cracking down on freedom of movement even more. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not off topic though...I disagreed with OP and their entire premise. I don&#39;t think this attack was launched to distract from Trumps abuse allegations, at all. I think what I stated is the far more important topic at hand, and I even made self-post about it.</p>

<p>Do you think the sexual assault allegations are credible? If they are, I’d still say OP’s theory is unlikely, but I could understand why someone might think they are connected.</p>

<p>Well it took 9 hours to get to that point. For the first several it was about the same as the rest, pretty slow day overall on this thread. When I make comments, I just state my opinion and let the wind take it where it will. </p>

<p>Time will tell, though when it first came out last year it seemed mostly politically motivated. I&#39;m not sure why the media would drop it for more than a year and only now decide to bring it up. Will have to wait and see what is actually brought forth. </p>

<p>If I wanted to kill a discussion, I’d make a post like that and then have my bots upvote it to the top of the comments. Then ideally everyone would be talking about the bomb for example, and not if it was a distraction or not. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know enough about the cases, but the fact that the people involved have been pretty consistent for over a decade about what went down, does give them more credibility.</p>

<p>Some of it&#39;s for meme&#39;s and laughs though.</p>

<p>I assume he does movies or something? I think I maybe, and this is a stretch, went to the movies once this year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never seen House of Cards, though I have an idea of what it is about.</p>

<p>Haven&#39;t been to a play since the early 2010&#39;s and that was not under my own accord. Have probably seen less than 10 new movies total this decade. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t watch any new TV unless it&#39;s news, reality shows or GoT. Gave up watching sports after it started becoming political.</p>
