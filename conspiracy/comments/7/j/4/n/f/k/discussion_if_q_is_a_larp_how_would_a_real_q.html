<p>I&#39;ve seen both sides of the issue, is &quot;Q&quot; a LARP or not? That&#39;s not the point of this post, rather I would like to start a dialog on how someone would directly release top secret information, directly while maintaining their secrecy.   </p>

<p><strong>For the purpose of this exercise we need to assume that the &quot;Q&quot; that has been operating in the recent past is a LARP. I&#39;m not stating he/she is, but in order to discuss this and come up with new ideas, we need to assume that a &quot;real Q&quot; would operate in a different way. Ultimately this exercise could lend credibility to Q or it could help to expose it as a LARP if our ideas are discussed and examined logically.</strong></p>

<p>To start here are my assumptions about the Q that is currently operating: </p>

<p>Q would want to communicate directly (in this case through the Chan networks) to avoid anyone knowing their identity. No wikileaks, no journalists, no 3rd party who could ever sell him/her out. Just one person with their computer disseminating information to the public.   </p>

<p>Q would have to be cryptic to maintain plausible deniability if anyone were to ever begin to piece together who &quot;Q&quot; actually is.</p>

<p>Q at times would give false info in an effort to disseminate information but also keep the powers that be at bay by chalking it up to someone guessing and making vague statements that some seem to correlate to IRL events.</p>

<p>Mailing location, Envelope, purchased postage, USB stick, Metadata, Fingerprints, trace DNA, not to mention any and all cameras that watch as you drop that USB stick in the mail. </p>

<p>This evidence probably isn&#39;t enough to say beyond a shadow of a doubt that &quot;you&quot; were the one that sent the USB stick, but if it is assumed it&#39;s you then inquiring minds would just have to go back and look into your whereabouts around the time the USB stick was dropped into the mail and watch the tape until they saw that envelop get dropped. It may not prove it in court but if you&#39;re being hunted by people you believe are capable of unspeakable things, it may be enough to prove it to them that you should commit suicide. </p>

<p>Then you would assume that they would not care about being found out or that the sources they release would be somewhat widely known, else they be found out? I can&#39;t think of a way you do this without being found out. </p>

<p>no great leaker should expect to remain anonymous, and to do so only clouds their credibility and casts doubt on the info they were leaking.</p>

<p>all the &quot;great leaks&quot; in history have been done by the truly brave, that stood up and said &quot;this is what i believe in.&quot;</p>

<p>trying to do so anonymously just reeks of propaganda/disinfo. that&#39;s my opinion, at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with part of this, what if the end goal required you to continue to operate in your position if real change were to take place? </p>

<p>IE. If you leak information that is important to the masses and exposes the wrong doing of a powerful group, but in doing so you open yourself to criminal prosecution would you have not sacrificed the winning of the &quot;war&quot; just to win a single battle? You will absolutely lose your ability to do damage to the PTB from a jail cell or if you find that you&#39;ve committed suicide by shooting yourself in the head multiple times? </p>

<p>You&#39;re right it does cast doubt if done anonymously. I don&#39;t see anyway it wouldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>I agree, obviously there are more privacy measures that a real Q would want to take but if I implied or stated that he/she wouldn&#39;t have plausible deniability by posting on the chans I will edit my post, can you help me out here?</p>

<p>Sorry this just isn&#39;t relevant to the conversation. We aren&#39;t accusing anyone, we have, for the sake of this thought experiment assumed that Q is a LARP. Not saying that he is IRL, just using it as a limitation to breed creativity in this discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for that user, but I do feel that the resistance and shaming over even entertaining anon is an important piece of the discussion. For all we know, Q is a plant to discredit anons as a concept. </p>

<p>To answer your OP, though, if I were an IRL anon, I would use the chans. It really is the only way to get unadulterated messages to the public.</p>

<p>As for the cryptic speak- sometimes that is what it takes to get people to dig in and gain actual knowledge. People are really resistant to knew ideas and leading them to their own realization without &quot;telling&quot; them is a pretty effective tool, in my experience. </p>

<p>A &quot;real Q&quot; would have to be cryptic to maintain plausible deniability if anyone were to ever begin to piece together who &quot;Q&quot; actually is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the part I disagree with. Being cryptic doesn&#39;t really help because anyone who is actually familiar with what he is discussing would easily see through it, but his target audience may be confused and misinterpret his message. Take this &quot;false flag&quot; claim for example. If this was actually a false flag, there are probably a relatively small number of people who were aware of it ahead of time. That already narrows down who Q for anyone who is part of the conspiracy. Then add in his previous messages and they could quickly narrow down what other things he knew ahead of time. There has to be a really small overlap between who is aware of this false flag, who is aware of upcoming arrests, etc where they could easily figure out who this is.</p>

<p>So really the best way to leak stuff like this is either leak it all at once and then disappear, or leak it in a way that could never be tied to a specific person. That would mean no predicting events though, and no references to meeting or conversations where only a small number of people were involved. </p>

<p>I think the whole Q thing is an psyop to keep us busy, or he is being used to direct our attention to things crowd sourcing is better at. Or maybe not better at, but they ran out of leads and are hoping the autists come up with something?</p>

It seems like people think it would be needed to help the masses accept some hard truth. I don&#39;t really think that would be an issue provided there is actual evidence. Why not just give it to every media outlet in the world, or wiki leaks, or whatever? I don&#39;t see the people over at 4chan being necessary for anything at all.

<p>This is a good question but I think you answer it:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You agree that the information needs to be released in order to inform the public but your idea is to release it to the media, or a third party that would then have evidence of who you were. There&#39;s almost no way to not have some evidence left when you start involving other people. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Except that you believe that true, leakable information needs to reach the public. Remaining anonymous by bringing in other people in hopes that they disseminate the information for you, seems like a good way to be outed.   </p>

<p>How would you disseminate this information if in the same position and didn&#39;t want to be caught?</p>

I just think if there is going to be some big arrests or whatever let them happen then present the reasons for them.

I just cant fathom what could be so hard to swallow... lets say they are a bunch of satanic pedo war criminals... okay well if you got proof you got proof.

<p>Mention this to anyone who doesn&#39;t consume conspiracies regularly and their eyes glaze over and in their eyes you&#39;re clearly insane. If you sent this to a bunch of journalists, you&#39;re giving a lot of free evidence and info like this is laughed off as crazy every day. </p>

<p>What if these people control the courts? Or at least there are enough in positions of power that you&#39;re not sure who you could trust? Further what if there isn&#39;t sufficient evidence? What if those that would do the arresting/warrant granting are on the take? What if in order to play the game of politics you have to make these kinds of deals to get the type of influence and funding needed to move up the ladder?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For starters, a real insider who wished to keep posting would have provided a way to verify him/her in the future.  It could be something inherently online (like placing a pgp encryption key along with his post that will verify future posts) or be something as mundane as a picture of something unique he owns with a posted note of showing today&#39;s date.  (for instance an old baseball glove or a handkerchief.  MegaAnon did this with her feet.</p>

<p>To stay safe, he would just need to use a VPN or just a pubic wifi/computer to post on 4chan.    But honestly, the info he&#39;s given out so far isn&#39;t anything unknown to all.  Like they&#39;re trying to take down the deep state, bla bla...  Ya ok.  Whatever.  </p>

<p>Anyway, the most important thing would be to prove that he in fact is someone on the inside.  And this would be SOOO simple to do.  Post a couple of lines from Trump&#39;s speech before he goes on air.  Post what color tie he&#39;s wearing today before he steps in front of a camera for the first time.  Post what link Trump is going to retweet next.  Tell us what he&#39;s going to have for dinner that night.  For heaven&#39;s sake, proving he&#39;s real is quite simple and he wouldn&#39;t have to release any classified or sensitive information at all.  But no, all we get is vague predictions like &quot;expect fireworks&quot;  Ya, no shit.  Capitol of Israel was just moved to Jerusalem.  You think maybe there&#39;s a chance that a terrorist attack will happen somewhere very soon?  Hmm, what a genius!  </p>
