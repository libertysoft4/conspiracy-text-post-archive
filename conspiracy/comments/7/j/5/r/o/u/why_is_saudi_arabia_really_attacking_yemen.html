    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Let me summarize what I learned from the translations. I&#39;ve had time to learn who was &quot;the son&quot; or &quot;the lord&quot; and especially what was &quot;the box of El.&quot; Here is the story:</p>

<p>Menelek, the only son of Queen Saba (i.e. Queen Sheba) and Solomon, was depressed when he learned that his father&#39;s kingdom had been overcome and the Temple in Jerusalem was sacked. His grief was deep (&quot;...the happiness of the Son was poisoned...&quot;) and this worried his mother. Shortly after this invasion of Jerusalem, Menelik received word that the Ark of the Covenant (the &quot;box/cell of the Lord&quot; AT-EL), formerly housed in Solomon&#39;s Temple, was relocated for its protection.</p>

<p>The text refers to an &quot;oath&quot; that was taken by Menelik to protect the Ark, apparently consumated by a ring that was given to Menelik when he visited Solomon as a young man. Menelik also received a warning from Nathan, his half-brother, that the Ark could be harmful to his health and that it had caused vision problems and &quot;trembling&quot; when Nathan had attempted to interact with it. Menelik retrieves the Ark but has none of these adversities and eagerly interacts with this &quot;box of El&quot;, eventually constructing a special underground chamber where he stores the Ark and converses through it with the Lord.</p>

<p>As the danger of invading enemies becomes real for the kingdom of Saba, Menelik announces that the Lord has instructed him to enter the underground chamber with the Ark, and to have the entire construction covered with sand to conceal it from hostile forces. Menelik informs his mother, Queen Saba, that he will remain buried with the Ark for a long period of time, until a &quot;friendly&quot; nation is overhead.</p>

<p>Following her only son&#39;s instructions, Menelik is buried with the Ark. However, his mother has a smaller chamber constructed adjacent to the Ark chamber with a secret peephole (&quot;...aperture...&quot;) so that she can monitor his condition. She secretly plans to open the chamber and rescue her son should he be in danger and has had one of the chamber walls constructed without mortar.</p>

<p>On many occasions, Queen Saba viewed her son inside the chamber. She mentions that he received a future revelation from the Ark, which sounded to her like thunder. As she watched Menelik interact with the Ark, she noted that he trembled and shook from the visions that were being shown to him.</p>

<p>As time passed, the thundering noise and movement of her son ceased. Upon opening the secret peephole, the Queen saw a worm crawl out. This suggested that maybe Menelik had died. The Queen was determined to open the chamber and rescue her son but she recalled his faith and remembered his words, that he would be buried for &quot;a long time.&quot; She wept (&quot;...cried an ocean of tears...&quot;) that his vision of the future also included the revelation that she had doubted his word and she prayed that he would forgive her for her doubts.</p>

<p>Determined to honor her son&#39;s wishes, Queen Saba has the chamber reinforced with more stone and mortar. She consults with the builders and masons to design an enclosure that would protect the buried chamber from future earthquakes, floods, salt (?) and other natural disasters. The chamber was thus made more sturdy and a large dam was constructed around the buried chamber to protect it from water and floods. This oval dam bares the story, inscribed in the old language.</p>

<p>The Queen then &quot;dimmed&quot; her kingdom [see right Translation: The Mother (M) dimmed (AMYM) her nation (LM) because of (YN) the good Lord&#39;s (ligature-EL) goodness/sign (TV).] in Yemen and moved her entourage to Ethiopia, confounded her language to Himyaritic, a copy of the Ark was made and she allowed the buried palace and its courtyard to be consumed by the desert sands. There it remained for almost 3000 years until it was discovered by Wendell Philips, ironically the character on whom Indiana Jones was based in the movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark.</p>

<p>Take it for what you will. Perhaps Queen Sheba <em>wanted</em> future historians and scientists to believe the Arc was in Ethiopia in order to keep it protected. If people spend all their time looking in Ethiopia, they will never find it in Yemen.</p>

<p>Assuming this theory and story is true of course.</p>

<p>Expand their influence in the region and curb Saudi influence. It&#39;s a modern cold war between SA and Iran.</p>

<p>Same reason that they are heavily involved in Syria directly with the IRGC and indirectly with Hezbollah. Same in Lebanon with Hezbollah. Not all, but several of the conflicts in the region can be boiled down to Saudi vs Iran. Qatar, Bahrain, etc. a lot of them are just Saudi vs Iran proxy conflicts.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Saudi Arabia is not the only country in the region with large oil and natural gas reserves. Iran also has a much larger and a much more educated populace than Saudi Arabia does. My AI research lab here is 4/6 Iranian. Also, investments from India, Europe, and China are pouring in now that the sanctions have been lifted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is Iran able to compete with Saudi Arabia&#39;s regional influence?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because Saudi Arabia&#39;s regional influence is truly pathetic. Best example is Yemen. Saudi Arabia can&#39;t even get rid of a bunch of rebels without getting help from Uncle Sam. Iran has a much better internal army (IRGC) and much more powerful proxy armies under their control (Hezbollah, Iraqi PMU). </p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know. I never follow msm coverage of wars since they rarely report it from the source correctly.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t check the mainstream media for news about active wars. There are crowdsourced websites like <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3zJ7LiYPYAhVU4WMKHbduD-8QFggnMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fyemen.liveuamap.com%2F&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3dpxFelwkDFBPnm3w2ao6h">yemen.liveuamap</a> that does a much better job. I also follow the syrian war through crowd sourced methods, as well as following the sub reddit for that war. There are people in that sub that are actively on the ground reporting on the war and are much more detailed about group actions and movements than anything you can get from msm sources.</p>

<p>Cause it is corroborated by other sources on the ground.  It depends on the source and depends what I see other people talk about in the sub. I can also view troop movements over time to see if the information that army X is fighting in location A against army Y makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bad actors in Yemen and Iran, CIA is connected as well. Saudi Arabia&#39;s purge is no coincidence, they likely had to cut off their own bad actors there that were funding the Yemeni rebels to finally stamp out the Yemeni rebels.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like how here, once America stopped fucking over Syria and funding their own fucking rebels, ISIS has been nearly completely ousted. No government toppling for you, deep state.</p>

<p>It&#39;s highly likely that in the near future, we&#39;re going to see North Korea go down as well where bad actors are removed and some form of intermediary government steps in &gt; nation recovers &gt; Korea becomes one. One can only hope.</p>

<p>Hardest to swallow will be the purging in America and Europe because we have the &quot;best&quot; western nations, bad actors are entrenched, and the path to removal is extremely delicate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude. it&#39;s all about economics and trade rout bottle-necks. they want to subdue yemen to remove any potential headaches in the gulf of Aden for trade routs. same thing with partially for iran in the gulf of Oman/ Persian gulf. it&#39;s also the same reason that the EU is pissed that russia clenched a trade rout when they gained favor with chrimea. water trade routs. period.</p>
