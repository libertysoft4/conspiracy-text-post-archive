<p>Assange got the Clinton Dirt from Russian hackers, who are likely currently affiliated with the Russian Governmemt. Thus, Trump utilized information obtained ILLEGALLY by a hostile foreign government.</p>

<p>Clinton got the Trump dirt from a private citizen, who obtained the information LEGALLY. </p>

<p>Further, there&#39;s evidence that Trump and Russia discussed a transactionary deal where Russia would funnel the data through Wikileaks in exchange for loosening of sanctions.</p>

<p>Nonsense that has been debunked multiple times. </p>

<p>Clinton <em>paid for op research, most of which was false, and this research was illegally used to obtain a FISA to spy an opposing political campaign.</em> That is what&#39;s being revealed. That is why Mueller has gotten nowhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More like it was quickly downvoted by shills and democrats (sorry but there&#39;s no appreciable difference seeing as how leftists downvote truth if it doesn&#39;t fit their worldview) just like anything else that goes against the narrative. If I remember correctly the people who did the analysis were retired intelligence people, where as the only ones that say it was hacked were &quot;all 17 intelligence agencies&quot;, which as it turns out meant 3 intelligence agencies, surprisingly of those 17, 14, including the likes of the Coast Guard or the Geospatial Intelligence Agency, declined to weigh in. The ones that did happen to be the ones most heavily politicized by the Obama administration... no matter, we&#39;re slowly but surely uncovering the evidence and in the end justice will be done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slavery was once legal... Legality is a terrible standard. And, words like probably and likely don&#39;t mean a thing. Machines communicate and the flow of data is easy to trace. If it was russia, they&#39;d of already known. Also, we see Saudi and israels role so them hacking lebanon and giving it to America would be ok in your standard then? Also, it was a Russian hacker who gave the evidence of rigging markets in The EU. So the banks sgould of been given a pass as it was Russia who alerted them. Or what about Russia alerting us to the holocaust? Should that info be not allowed in America since it was a bad state that provided it? What about the actual info and it not mattering who gave it?</p>
