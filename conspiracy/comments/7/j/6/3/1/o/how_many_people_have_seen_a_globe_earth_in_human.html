<p>As the other user responded to you how the Eratosthenes experiment can also calculate correctly for a nearby sun scenario. And go google the ships &quot;disappearing&quot; over the curve, there are tons of videos I think it is the Nikon camera, it has a super zoom as soon as they disappear from the naked eye just use the camera and there are the ships. No curve. And yes, they&#39;ve attached GoPros to weather balloons.
I guess the weirdest thing NO ONE can debunk is how the moonlight gives off colder light than the sun, like in the shadows of moonlight is warmer than in direct moonlight (exact opposite of the sun)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t all fly the &quot;same route.&quot;  First &quot;route&quot; is kinda meaningless when you&#39;re talking about orbital dynamics -- the term you&#39;re really thinking of is orbital inclination.  Generally, US craft orbit at an inclination of around 28 degrees, because that&#39;s the ideal inclination to launch from off of Cape Canaveral.  (The closer you are to the equator, the faster yore moving due to the earth&#39;s rotation, and the more kinetic energy you can add to your launch to help achieve orbit.) </p>

<p>ISS, however, is at 51.6 degrees.  That&#39;s the same inclination that MIR had, because that&#39;s the inclination of orbit that&#39;s easiest to get launching from Baikonur (Russia&#39;s space center in Siberia) without passing over Chinese airspace.</p>

<p>When the Russians and the US were negotiating the placement of the ISS, they chose the inclination that&#39;s easer for the cosmonauts because the more inclined towards polar orbit the inclination is, the greater he percentage of land that you will eventually pass over, so the more-inclined Russian orbit had greater scientific value.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Where are all the other satellites? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, think about this for a second.  There are a little over 2000 operational satellites in orbit.  The earth&#39;s surface area is just under 200 million square miles. So if you were to place every satellite on the earth&#39;s surface, spaced evenly, each satellite would be about 300 miles from its closest neighbor. Obviously satellites aren&#39;t evenly spread around the glove, but they are deliberately kept in different orbits to avoid crashing -- any given satellite will be at least dozens of miles from the nearest satellite, each of which will be moving extremely rapidly compared to its neighbors.  (Orbit is FAST, and the velocity changes quickly depending on orbit -- a satellite orbiting at an altitude of 620 miles will be moving over 1000 mph relative to one orbiting at 680 miles.)  So not surprising you can&#39;t see any others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where are the stars?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t see them, because it&#39;s daytime.  Any camera aperture that won&#39;t be washed out by viewing the satellite in daytime isn&#39;t sensitive enough to see the stars, which you can only see at night.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What satellite is this? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where are the millions of other satellites?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, there are only about 2,200 operational satellites at the moment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about space trash in orbit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The vast majority of space trash is less than 10 cm, so impossible to see from any distance besides right up close -- plus, from the reference point of any orbit, even the closest debris will be traveling at relative velocity of hundreds of miles an hour.  No suprise you can&#39;t see something a couple centimeters across, dozens of miles away, traveling at a couple hundred miles per hour.</p>

<p>Only if you strictly recreate the experiment by <em>only</em> making <em>two</em> simultaneous measurements.</p>

<p>If you make more, you quickly find that the only alternative explanations are &quot;The sun is millions of miles away and the earth is a sphere&quot; or &quot;the sun is actually very close, but simultaneously in many different locations, which is physically impossible.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V03eF0bcYno">Here is the proof</a></p>

<p>Now, tell me, do you believe that the sun can be in different locations depending on where you view it from, or is the sun only in one location? If you say the latter, then you have proved the earth is a sphere.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And go google the ships &quot;disappearing&quot; over the curve, there are tons of videos (I think it is the Nikon camera?) it has a super zoom as soon as the boats disappear from the naked eye</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disappearing from the naked eye has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Not one of those videos has <em>ever</em> zoomed halfway in and shown the bottom half of the ship hidden below the horizon, then zoomed in further to show the bottom half reappear.</p>

<p>What <em>actually</em> happens is they zoom in and the bottom half of the ship is still hidden below the very real physical horizon.</p>

<p>Nope. Anything in &quot;shadow&quot; at night is actually losing heat less quickly because it can&#39;t radiate that heat away as quickly. The moon has nothing to do with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are all interesting points but I wouldn&#39;t say conclusive.</p>

<p>Re: the linked video experiment: GREAT real-world experiment but hardly ACCURATE scientifically since in the photos you can see all kinds of mismatched rulers, bent rulers, etc. which are hard to account for.</p>

<p>Also, and this may play in to the horizon issue, there is a such thing as atmospheric lensing/refracting, which may dillute such mesurements. The point of the ships is, can you show a ship going over the curve? We cannot prove a negative, and why you see &quot;some&quot; obfuscation near the bottom is mainly due to waves (the water is not 100% flat) at varying distances blocking your view. I think unless you can prove otherwise, at very least you have to admit that ships disappearing over a horizon is essentially an old wives tale. Def NOT science.</p>

<p>Lastly, I think you are saying the same thing, the shadows are losing heat less quickly. You are just reversing the language. The moonlight is COOLING things. Otherwise, how does the moon have nothing to do with it if yoiu are in the moon&#39;s &quot;shadow&quot; as you say? In the daytime, do you say you are losing cool less quickly when you are in the shade from the sunlight? It&#39;s just words one way or the other.</p>

<p>The math doesnt add up. You can figure this out at home. </p>

<p>The method you are suggesting works on one spot and one spot only. When you take measurements from other locations at the same time the angles dont add up. </p>

<p>Eratosthenes actually disproves a FE. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And go google the ships &quot;disappearing&quot; over the curve, there are tons of videos (I think it is the Nikon camera?) it has a super zoom as soon as the boats disappear from the naked eye, just use the camera and there are the ships again! No curve. And yes, they&#39;ve attached GoPros to weather balloons.</p>

<p>Wrong again!</p>

<p>Boat zoomed in on with a P900 disappears over the horizon, bottom first at that!</p>

<p>Ever wonder why 100% of zoom videos never follow an object over the horizon? Havent you ever asked yourself why they just zoom in and call it a day?</p>

<p>Ask yourself about what environmental factors are at play. Its obvious if  you think about it for a few minutes. </p>
