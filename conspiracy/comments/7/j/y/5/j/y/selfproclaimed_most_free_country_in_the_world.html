<p>My personal belief as to why our reality is so upside-down is because it is on purpose. Our emotions feed the gods, both higher and lower. This density is set to keep and not release. It&#39;s all a challenge to be free of desire! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe one day we&#39;ll all grow up and realize the fallacy behind &#39;making money&#39; and the double standards the western culture promotes.</p>

<p>Why is it whenever somebody speaks of something taboo, culturally or otherwise, IE, Dr. Greer, that the instant anybody sees he&#39;s offering something for sale, Contact App, Documentaries(none of these things are free to create) it&#39;s automatic grounds for dismissal, DESPITE our entire culture being based around personal greed and wealth.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll change when all the good people realize the power in this country actually rests in the people, despite any &#39;laws&#39;(anything that undermines the Constitution is supposed to be null and void) and tech these psychopaths may have. The fear of death is what prevents people from making change.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never regarded Americans as cowards. I think most of them are, unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of Americans have been hypnotized and brainwashed by the lies and propaganda that is spewing out of their television sets.</p>

<p>Liars in Armani suits who call themselves &quot;News anchors&quot;...are really extremely well paid actors, traitors to the American people who follow a script, the narrative, provided by mega rich Geopolitical interests. Pro war, pro zionist, pro oil, pro Big Pharma, pro Big Aggie, Pro anything big corporate...and anti anything that mat detract from their agenda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad...I&#39;m a 55 year old American. By choice, I live way out in the woods of Maine far away from the cities and suburbs. I&#39;ve watched my country go completely down the shit hole after 9/11. Watched as US gov&#39;t became infested with neocons and neolibs frothing at the mouth for war...and demonizing the people who stand for peace in this world. I watched over the years as peaceful, anti-war presidential candidates were literally trashed in the MSM as being &quot;weak&quot; and get this...&quot;dangerous&quot; for wanting to pull out military out of the Middle East. The TV watchers keep watching. The brainwash sets in.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched as deranged politicians who are uninterested in the welfare of America and obsessed with the Middle East are elected into office. They put a nasty, psychotic and racist little country called Israel before their own people....and they lie, lie, lie every day about what is really going on over there.  Unfortunately, the hypnotized TV watchers eat it up. They believe the traitors lies. They believe we have to be at war in the Middle East...they don&#39;t realize that our men and women are dying out there for a lie, for that nasty little country that won&#39;t even send their cowardly little bitches they call men out to fight their own wars. The wars in the Middle East have NOTHING to do with US National Security...NOTHING! </p>

<p>There is a very sick agenda that has been planned out. The MSM liars are all in place to keep the majority of Americans clueless and out of touch. The beast that enslaves the minds of the people is immense.     </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t think we should be an empire, ha, that&#39;s not the design and original purpose of the country, but it would seem that may be the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This idea of American empire really started at the end of the 1800s and beginning of the 1900s. The subsequent world wars, while I don&#39;t believe they were started with the intent of American empire, provided an opportunity create such an empire. America started with economic imperialism and then moved right to military imperialism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At least in a fascist perspective it&#39;s the case, the military industry is fascist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I personally don&#39;t see it as fascism but instead as a re-boot of the caste system with the MIC as one step below the pinnacle. The money controllers would be at the top (the new royalty/aristocracy)  and they are doing everything they can to ensure everyone else is enraptured by the illusion of money. But this is just my perspective and opinion.</p>
