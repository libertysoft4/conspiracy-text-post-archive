        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know a lot of people are freaking out right now, so I wanted to take a moment to bring a little bit of perspective to this whole thing. I want to direct your attention to this <a href="https://goo.gl/z5GrYy">US Court of Appeals</a> decision from May 1st, 2017. Specifically, pgs 13 thru 17. I&#39;ll provide the highlights below.</p>

<p>From Page 14, paragraph 1</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, as the panel decision held and
the agency has confirmed, <strong>the net neutrality rule applies only to “those broadband providers that hold themselves out as neutral, indiscriminate conduits”</strong> to any internet content of a subscriber’s own choosing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From page 14, paragraph 3</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The upshot of the FCC’s Order therefore is to <strong>“fulfill the
reasonable expectations of a customer who signs up for a broadband service that promises access to all of the lawful Internet”</strong> without editorial intervention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From page 15, paragraph 2</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While the net neutrality rule applies to those ISPs that
hold themselves out as neutral, indiscriminate conduits to
internet content, the converse is also true: <strong>the rule does not
apply to an ISP holding itself out as providing something
other than a neutral, indiscriminate pathway</strong>—i.e., an ISP
making sufficiently clear to potential customers that it
<strong>provides a filtered service involving the ISP’s exercise of
“editorial intervention.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From page 15, paragraph 2</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For instance, Alamo Broadband, the lone broadband provider that raises a First Amendment challenge to the rule, posits the example of an ISP wishing to provide access solely to “family friendly websites.” Alamo Pet. Reh’g 5. <strong>Such an ISP, as long as it represents itself as engaging in editorial intervention of that kind, would fall outside the rule.</strong> The Order thus specifies that <strong>an ISP remains “free to offer ‘edited’ services” without becoming subject to the rule’s requirements.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The definition of &quot;editorial intervention&quot; is provided on page 16, paragraph 1</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That would be true of an ISP that offers subscribers a
curated experience by <strong>blocking websites lying beyond a
specified field of content</strong> (e.g., family friendly websites). It
would also be true of an ISP that engages in other forms of
editorial intervention, such as <strong>throttling of certain applications
chosen by the ISP</strong>, or <strong>filtering of content into fast (and slow)
lanes based on the ISP’s commercial interests. An ISP would
need to make adequately clear its intention to provide “edited
services” of that kind</strong>, id. ¶ 556, so as to avoid giving
consumers a mistaken impression that they would enjoy
indiscriminate “access to all content available on the Internet,
without the editorial intervention of their broadband
provider,” id. ¶ 549. It would not be enough under the Order,
for instance, for “consumer permission” to be “buried in a
service plan—the threats of consumer deception and
confusion are simply too great.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rules were always voluntary: from page 17, paragraph 1</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In that sense, <strong>the rule could be characterized as “voluntary,”</strong> infra at 25-26 n.8 (Kavanaugh,
J., dissenting), but in much the same way that just about any
regulation could be considered voluntary, insofar as a
regulated entity could always transform its business to such
an extent that it is no longer in the line of business covered by
the regulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So here&#39;s the takeaway from the Net Neutrality rules that were in place until about an hour ago:</p>

<ul>
<li>The rules only applied to an ISP if it represented itself as simply being a conduit between users and content.</li>
<li>The rules DID NOT apply to an ISP that wished to engage in &quot;editorial intervention&quot;</li>
<li>The definition of editorial intervention includes blocking and filtering content, throttling speeds, or providing for fast lanes and slow lanes (basically everything Net Neutrality is supposed to prevent)</li>
<li>The rules were always voluntary</li>
</ul>

<p>But how can this be? We were told ISPs were made into utilities and were therefore bound to the regulations described in Title 47, Chapter I, Sub-Chapter A, Part 8: Protecting and promoting the open internet. Well let&#39;s take a look at those <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=369a88c1c5939d64c4ff67a211d3717f&amp;amp;mc=true&amp;amp;node=pt47.1.8&amp;amp;rgn=div5">regulations</a>.</p>

<p>First, take note of the term <em>Broadband Internet Access Service</em>. The definition reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Broadband Internet Access Service</em>: A mass-market retail service by wire or radio that provides the capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or substantially all Internet endpoints,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ll notice that all of the regulations for No Blocking, No Throttling, No Paid Prioritization, etc. are written to apply to <em>Broadband Internet Access Services</em>.</p>

<p>So, if Comcast represents themselves as <strong>providing you the capability to transmit data or receive data from ALL or SUBSTANTIALLY ALL internet endpoints</strong> then, and ONLY THEN, do they fall within the definition of a <em>Broadband Internet Access Service</em>. And because they fit that definition, the rules would then apply to them.</p>

<p>However, IF Comcast decided that they wanted to provide a platform for content that was strictly divided along say a progressive ideology, or even a conservative ideology, that would require that they limit their access to a very limited scope of internet endpoints by blocking access to anything that doesn&#39;t fit in with their progressive, or conservative, platform.</p>

<p>In that scenario, Comcast would no longer be providing you the capability to transmit to or receive data from ALL or SUBSTANTIALLY ALL internet endpoints. In fact, what they would be providing you is the capability to transmit data to or receive data from <strong>A VERY LIMITED SCOPE OF INTERNET ENDPOINTS.</strong> Therefore, they would no longer fit the definition of a <em>Broadband Internet Access Service</em>. And because they no longer fit that definition, the rules governing Broadband Internet Access Services would no longer apply to them.</p>

<p>Bottom line? It&#39;s a loophole. An internet loophole if you will, that effectively makes the regulations voluntary and allows an ISP to engage in the very things we don&#39;t want them to. And they&#39;ve been that way since 2015. It had to be this way because the first amendment provides significant hurdles when it comes the &quot;idea&quot; of Net Neutrality. The Supreme Court has ruled and reaffirmed numerous times over the years that companies have first amendment rights to speech. Therefore, achieving Net Neutrality in any meaningful way presents significant legal challenges, and many hurdles, when it comes to the first amendment.</p>

<p>You have to understand that the best the government can do is to make sure companies abide by their representations to it&#39;s customers and be transparent about it&#39;s business practices. Which is the only thing Net Neutrality provided us under the Obama era regulations. <strong>Despite what people want to believe, Net Neutrality never did, and never could, force ISPs to not block, not filter, not throttle, not engage in paid prioritization.</strong> It isn&#39;t legally possible to achieve that level of Net Neutrality without stepping all over the Constitution. What they can do though, is force companies to be transparent and honest with us. Which is the only meaningful thing we got out of Net Neutrality.</p>

<p>So when someone says the internet sky is going to start falling now, just know that the internet sky could have been falling at any point over the last two years even with the Net Neutrality regulations in place.</p>

<p>Then what your really saying is the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals is bullshit. You don&#39;t have to believe this post. I provided you a link to the very decision every bit of this information came from.</p>

<p>If you disagree with this information, that&#39;s between you and the United States Court of Appeals. Good luck with that.</p>

However, I will say, your arguments and your research is one of the more thorough I have seen on this sub in a while. 
Most people simply make the claim, and when asked for proof, say “just go search online for it”
You provided proof and links alongside your arguments. 
While I don’t agree with your post, I can certainly back the way you brought it up. Kudos for that. </p>

<p>I went to the doctors the other day, mind you this was in the hood but I saw something that opened my eyes. A doctors office that literally only took Obamacare was full of white, black, Latino and so many others. All of these people needed help in order to get their insurance and I knew that this man protected the people of the United States. People were being healed instead of killed and look who is attempting to take that away? Who is searching for the funds to begin the killing? Ask yourself that.</p>
