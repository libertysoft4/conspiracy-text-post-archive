    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading about early history of the new world, and the giant non-secret stuff that&#39;s just never mentioned in popular education is astonishing. For instance, the colonies/US for 200 years shared half of its northern border not with Canada, but with a private corporation called the Hudson Bay Company. Why was the first revolutionary US flag that of their competitor, the East India Company? It turns out that not only was Jamestown not the first permanent European settlement in the colonies, it literally wasn&#39;t even the first European settlement in Jamestown!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was an abandoned Spanish mission rite at the site of Jamestown, which nobody ever talks about. An earlier attempt at English colonization was supposed to be headed to the Massachusetts Bay, but the settlers were instead dumped on an inhospitable island at Roanoke, surrounded by hostile natives. Why?  The English actually worked very hard to build peaceful relations with Native Americans, until this guy Ralph Lane went nuts at Roanoke a few years prior and started to massacre them. When searchers later came back looking for the Roanoke colonists, they found that the natives had been demolished by disease. Entire villages and tribes were gone, presumably because they had no immunity to European pathogens. But they found that the tribes from northern copper mining areas were comparatively unaffected. Did they acquire this immunity from generations of trading with other pre-columbian Europeans?</p>
