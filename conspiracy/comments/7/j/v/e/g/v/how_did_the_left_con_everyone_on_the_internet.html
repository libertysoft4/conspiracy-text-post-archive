        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This ruling will be fantastic for consumers. All this essentially will change is now your ISP will be able to charge Netflix and companies alike for their large data consumptions. This means more money for ISPs (big and small ones) to increase internet infrastructure instead of keeping up with increasing demands for streaming data with their revenue. In the end, Netflix might rise a few bucks a month more to compensate but their price is determined by the consumer so either the price will drop again or another streaming service will spring up to replace them at a lower price. Eventually the price of being an ISP will drop, and therefore ISPs will be able to offer better quality internet at a lower price. You win in the end, the only difference is now Netflix and Google and Facebook can&#39;t use loads of data for free. They lose money and that trickles into the economy. Good. Plain and simple.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, of course the biggest issue facing the Internet was that companies like Comcast -- which posted an operating margin of 22% last year and has $4 billion in cash on hand -- lacks the resources for investment.</p>

<p>And I suppose it&#39;s just cause I&#39;m a big ol&#39; dummy who never read Adam Smith that I&#39;m worried about the ability of ISPs holding local monopolies to use their gatekeeper function to stifle competition through anticompetitive agreements.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How? The issue is that the cost of building new infrastructure either requires the over-builder charge higher rates or it sustain losses for a long enough period to acquire a large user base, both of which are extremely difficult to pull off.  What matters is the over builder versus the incumbent.  If RCN asks for payment from web services so can the incumbent, which can then use that payment to subsidize lower consumer prices during the time the over builder poses a threat.</p>

<p>At the same time, the web service might also decide <em>not to pay the over builder for premium speed</em> because it doesn&#39;t yet command a large user-base making the payment worthwhile, providing a further advantage to the incumbent.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Haha. That&#39;s not where this money will go. It never does. It will go straight to the CEO&#39;s and Shareholders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the end, Netflix might rise a few bucks a month more to compensate but their price is determined by the consumer so either the price will drop again or another streaming service will spring up to replace them at a lower price.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it&#39;s a regressive policy, that forces the burden of increased cost, ultimately, onto the consumer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eventually the price of being an ISP will drop, and therefore ISPs will be able to offer better quality internet at a lower price</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ISP&#39;s are already a near monotonous market. In many parts of the country the only serious provider of Internet are megacorps like Comcast. They aren&#39;t going anywhere and will use NN to further increase their stranglehold in ther markets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the only difference is now Netflix and Google and Facebook can&#39;t use loads of data for free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You honestly believe that data is the problem? You think the ISP&#39;s can&#39;t already handle it with the resources and money they have if they didn&#39;t want to? They&#39;re lying to you, as Corporations always do.</p>

<p>This will have a chilling effect on the Internet, because this goes farther than the paltry examples you listed. They will use NN to stifle independent media and blog posts, because it won&#39;t be illegal to demand they pay more, or the consumer pay more, for access. They will funnel more people into the MSM narrative based sites and away from dissenting views and from views those who own these ISP Corps don&#39;t approve of. This is far bigger than you realize. </p>

<p>Right there you nailed it.  The major problem with internet in America is that for most there is only one ISP that can provide adequate service.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s break this down.  So, in your scenario there is only one internet provider in an area.  Repealing Net Neutrality is going to what?  Allow them to charge you more?  If there is only one provider and they want to charge you more <strong>they already could have</strong>.  Why go through the effort of lobbying to have it repealed and then making up marketing packages and expensive network switches that would be required to offer you tiered &quot;cable-like&quot; packages in order to charge you more when they could have just raised their prices and told you &quot;fuck you this is what it costs&quot; in the first fucking place?!</p>

<p>This argument that it will make people pay more and the market can&#39;t correct because of monopolies is bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cost is not necessary the issue.  Access is the issue.  Company X decides they are going to launch a new service.  Let&#39;s say it&#39;s called WebFlix.  Now they decide they don&#39;t want to compete with another similar service owned by another company so they decide to block the other service, or downgrade the bandwidth that this other service is allowed to such a low level that it&#39;s not useable. </p>

<p>With net neutrality out of the way there is nothing stopping that.</p>

<p>In an ideal world there would be other providers who could come along and offer service that allows the WebFlix competition full bandwidth.  </p>

<p>We don&#39;t live in an ideal world.  We live in America.  We are fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are examples of what caused a need for NN:</p>

<p>MADISON RIVER: In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.</p>

<p>COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.</p>

<p>TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T: From 2007–2009, AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&amp;T when it came on the scene in 2009.</p>

<p>WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.
MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.</p>

<p>PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&amp;T and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.</p>

<p>EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace.</p>

<p>VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T: In 2012, AT&amp;T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&amp;T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&amp;T’s own products.</p>

<p>VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re wrong. Say a &quot;fast lane&quot; is implemented, anywhere. They have to state that they have one, and as soon as that happens that company is grilled in the press and another company will replace them. Now new ISPs and regrettably Comcast and other stale shit ISPs will get more money, increasing competition. The part where Comcast loses is when ISPs become competitive enough that they can offer a lower price, better internet, and with no restrictions on content, because that is the eventuality. Nothing on the internet will change. Did you perhaps browse the web back in old &#39;09? No NN and they only had flimsy ass &quot;rules&quot; and sued companies for disobeying. They lost everytime because NN is HORRIBLE. Do you remember the content in 2009? Identical to 2017. Nothing will change, please believe what I&#39;m saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You understand that the current barrier to entry in the ISP market is having to keep up with data consumption, which means no money for infrastructure upgrades by small companies who don&#39;t want to shut down. Now they get more revenue, and increase their infrastructure because <em>they want to compete</em>. Real competitors will change for consumers to meet demands and the market. That will happen now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ISP market is already a set of monopolies in most markets. Giving more money to existing ISPs does not increase competition, it just improves the bottom line for existing players. There is a huge moat to becoming the same way there is a huge moat to becoming a new electric company, repealing NN does not reduce that moat. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Where do you see fault for consumers in NN</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consumers will be forced to pay more for services like Netflix. They will be forced to pay more on an arbitrary basis for websites that ISP deems they must pay more for. It will make ISP&#39;s even more money and leave consumers with less options.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if you believe that a barrier to entry for ISPs is the cables would you then support a revamp of the funding for the cables?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most definitely. Problem is, these same ISP&#39;s have, through their lobbying efforts, already shot down multiple attempts at tax payer funded, city-installed fiber optic cables in many states. As I said, it would be a lengthy court battle on a State by State basis in order to force existing ISP&#39;s to share their infrastructure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because currently the government is monopolizing that and increasing prices, not subsidizing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the Government does this because the big ISP&#39;s spend millions lobbying individual congressmen and representatives at the Federal, State, and Local level in order to prevent more radical measures to free up the market.</p>

<p>I would love for cities to be able to take the initiative, and lay their own public cables and infrastructure that new companies could then use. Problem is, this has been tried and vehemently attacked by the very ISP&#39;s you want to give more power to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>corps like Comcast have existing infrastructure. It is insanely expensive to build plant out to each and every home and business in a market. Not only that but you have to work out deals with each city. If your trunk line is going to go on poles you&#39;ll have to rent space on each poll from whoever &quot;owns&quot; it. If its a competitor they can just say no. Building your trunk lines underground? You&#39;ll need to work with the city and home owners to make that happen and the space for that plant is already taken in many cases by utilities and corps like Comcast your main competitor. I worked for comcast probably 8-9 years ago maintaining their trunk and I watched this play out first hand. Verizon was trying to come into Comcast&#39;s market building out their &quot;fios&quot;. They couldn&#39;t really get a foot hold and sold out to a company called Frontier for like 10 mil in that market. Frontier is still around but laying off people and not doing well. The cost to enter the market is too high for their to be true competition. Sure Comcast will continue to upgrade its systems but they are in no rush...its better for them to do it as slowly as possible and squeeze every penny out of their subscribers they possibly can.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And who was in favor of NN?</p>

<p>Google, the largest tech company in the world.</p>

<p>But please continue lecturing us on how big corps are against NN.</p>

<p>And remember the case that brought NN to limelight. It proves your &quot;independent media will die&quot; claim is bullshit.  Netflix was charged because they hog all the bandwidth. That&#39;s literally the only reason.</p>

<p>Unless independent media pushed out HAD streaming content, they won&#39;t be affected.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Then internet prices decrease and pays less. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the period until the new entrant dies, and the monopolist is no longer threatened.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The immediate next step would have to be to help lower the cost of the actual infrastructure that makes ISPs hard to survive in the market. If that is addressed then prices will lower, but Comcast will no longer be able to keep a hold on their monopoly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The issue here is that building infrastructure depends on <em>private right of ways</em>.  It seems that you&#39;re now calling for government intervention to subsidize new entrant&#39;s infrastructure buildouts -- recognizing a market failure -- in the same breath you&#39;re reciting faith-based free market platitudes to argue against common carrier status for data.  Regardless, it&#39;s not just the issue of infrastructure costs but also that the likely available pool of new users is structurally lower for a new entrant entering a mature market than an incumbent.</p>
