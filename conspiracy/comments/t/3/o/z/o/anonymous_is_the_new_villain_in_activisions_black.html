<p>Looking at who the developers are using as a consultant, Oliver North, and his &quot;Nightmare Scenario&quot; about a group of hackers who take over Drones and fire on US civilians.</p>

<p>I understand that this is a video game and it skirts around many &quot;real life&quot; issues, but this feels like a direct attack on a group of people who have been trying to clean up their image in the past year.</p>

<p>how reddit just flip-flops sides is unbelievable</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t blame video games for the Norway kid killing people, or any other kids who played violent games and went and shot up a school, you can&#39;t go to the extreme other side and say that this game will make them do that.</p>

<p>nobody thinks like this, it&#39;s a game..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How am I flip flopping?  I&#39;m gonna feed the troll here and say this...  I said that this game is propaganda, just like many other popular games of the past, hell, take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D">Wolfenstein</a>.  I didn&#39;t say that playing this game is going to make kids want to kill hackers, but this can certainly be construed as disinformation (or at the least bending imaginations).  Video games are not to blame for people blowing a head gasket, taking a rifle, and sniping off students on a campus.  What is to blame is the culture as a whole, including the inability to treat people with mental problems effectively.  Our music, mass media, entertainment industry, schools, glamorization of war, social bigotry, and refusal to except people who are differ from our points of view are all reasons why kids go nuts, take Daddy&#39;s pistol to school to shoot their favorite teacher.  Not <strong>JUST</strong> video games.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;ve played some violent games, and I&#39;ve lived some real life situations, the two are totally different.  Any well adjusted, mentally healthy, and rational human being can understand that.</p>

<p>Mentally healthy people can disassociate video games from reality. </p>

<p>People who play video games like CoD don&#39;t play the games for their &#39;awesome story line&#39; they play them because they&#39;re the newest FPS games and they know millions of other people will be playing them.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t going to say &quot;This is just like real life, I now hate whoever this game hates.&quot;</p>

<p>Seems like a lot of sarcasm and hyperbole coming from you though, so it&#39;s tough.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why I even bother, I got called a shill for pointing out that someone else misread an article, because I must be on &quot;their side&quot; for pointing it out.</p>

<p>Honestly, the gigantic enormous unbelievably huge majority of people are not looking at this as a propaganda technique, they&#39;re playing a video game.</p>

I guess I just shouldn&#39;t enter this subreddit because one in every hundred posters doesn&#39;t just assume the most gigantic crazy outcome out of every situation. I come here because I like the idea of legit conspiracies, not reading way too hard into something and then assuming it&#39;s something so much bigger than it is. Like every other post in this sub.</p>

<p>Numerous posters notice it when they come in here, and they just bow out because they know there&#39;s no hope.</p>

<p>I was called a shill and down voted to hell because I pointed out that some guy who made an extremely sensationalist thread, was simply misreading the article he was quoting. </p>

<p>Other than that they play them, among many adults, how does it have a massive impact?</p>

<p>Because kids playing this will see the &#39;enemy&#39; at the end of the game, and they will think that&#39;s their enemy? </p>

<p>So then are you under the impression that it&#39;s okay to blame video games when a kid who only played WoW commits murder?</p>

If anything, it&#39;ll just make Anonymous look like 12 year olds that call each other faggots all the time.</p>
