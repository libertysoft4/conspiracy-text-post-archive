    <div class="md"><p>Congratulations, you figured it out. Debt slavery has all sorts of benefits for the banks and the government. It insures that young people don&#39;t become political radicals -- they can&#39;t afford to, they need to get a job to pay off their student loans. It insures that the population of a region stays in that region -- when you get a good job you can&#39;t afford to casually give it up, especially because of the health benefits you would be losing. In short, it insures that you will become a worker bee in the establishment hive from the day you leave college until the day you retire (unless you die of stress first). And I should add, it insures that you never have any saved money, which means you need to borrow from the banks for any major purchase, and you run up credit card debts as well, being always short on savings. Did I mention that the people responsible for the present system of debt slavery should all be burned alive?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say there weren&#39;t still very real grievances regarding British rule in Ireland or that people shouldn&#39;t rise up against their slave masters.  I&#39;m just saying that historically, unrest often occurs after a relative loosening of repression and improvement in material conditions.  If you want to ignore history that&#39;s fine, but this isn&#39;t some theory I just cooked up, there are whole books written about this issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stability isnt solely improvement, it can also mean non recessionary times, little growth little decline, after the famine the home rule period began in Ireland which was ultimately the cause of the rising, and the home rule movement was inspired by....you guessed it....the very very harsh conditions during the famine (which interesting enough is speculated as a really old psyop if you beleive Karl Marx but that&#39;s a whole other issue all together) </p>

<p>My point is you can read all the books you want proving something they initially set out to prove but it doesn&#39;t make it fact, i really don&#39;t beleive you done research on the point i made and i don&#39;t blame you, but that&#39;s also besides the point because i was realistically just being snide originally, but yea i just got a little annoyed when you said you done research which backs your point cause its my history, my heritage and my culture and i know it inside out</p>

<p>(Im guessing your American so a little analogy for you, picture telling an angry black man his own history wrongly, its exactly the same as telling an Irish man his history wrongly)</p>

<p>But yea, revolutions could generally occur during a time of improvement but revolutions aren&#39;t spontaneous and the roots always go back to the time the really harsh times</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Marx was discussing capatalism and he breifly mentioned that the British empire didn&#39;t support us and let us starve in order to keep us demoralized and subservient but personally i don&#39;t know maybe the British just didn&#39;t have enough food to share.....so pretty much half the country died or emigrated, this is in his manifesto, i probably didn&#39;t get his point accross very well its been awhile since i read it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some would argue that the French Revolution represented the rising to prominence of the bourgeoisie merchant class which was only possible because of the erosion of feudalism.  So yes, they were able to revolt because they were no longer successfully repressed serfs, there had been an increase in freedom and prosperity since the late middle ages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is usury, not debt.  A dollar bill, even if it isn&#39;t issued into existence with interest like the federal reserve does now, is still a system of &quot;credit&quot; (or debt) wherein the holder expects to be able to exchange it for something of value.</p>

<p>The exchange system breaks down when you introduce usury.  That&#39;s where you get these people saying things about &quot;mathematically impossible&quot; to pay off, etc.  The opposition to usury from Christianity to Islam to Confucianism - most people through much of time - is very well founded indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our money is debt.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve defines the dollar notes they distribute  as  &#39;debt instruments&#39; and they are correct. </p>

<p>They loan out each and every dollar at interest. </p>

<p>Eventually they collect much more than a dollar for each dollar loaned but that interest is never created so it can&#39;t be repaid,   interest money can only come from more loans,  therefore  ever increasing debt is assured.</p>

<p>Also, consider this, If each dollar loaned out by the FED  is spent on average around once a week the total taxes collected on each dollar far exceeds  a dollar. </p>

<p>Just considering state sales taxes  of  perhaps 7%, the state sales taxes  on each individual dollar  would come to  $3.64 a year.</p>

<p>The real slavery is that we believe all the things we&#39;re told we &#39;have&#39; to do that result in debt.</p>

<p>Going to college, buying a couple nice cars, a nice house, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Then you come across a guy like Solarcabin on youtube and see a guy who built a house for around $10k and only has to cover around $200 a year in utility bills and you wonder what exactly makes your life better than his?</p>

<p>Its your fault. You can&#39;t blame someone offering you a loan, for you taking it.</p>
