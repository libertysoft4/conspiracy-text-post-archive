<p>I very much agree with this.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This I do not agree with, however.  Do not underestimate the ability, control, and power of the 1%.  The 99% have not by ANY means loosened themselves sufficiently from the constricting grasp of that ignorance imposed by the elite.  Heck, just look at Reddit.  There are a lot of progressive thinkers on here, but there are a <em>LOT</em> of people still very much lost in the muck and very ignorant of the truth.  Granted the truth is a very complicated thing at this point, but the point I&#39;m making is that the 99% still have a LONG way to go before the 1% give up the race.  The elite are still very much in control.  We&#39;re catching up to them very fast indeed, but they are also fighting very hard to KEEP that control, and if we don&#39;t don&#39;t push back even harder and make sure that we don&#39;t stay indolent and ignorant, then we <em>will</em> loose.</p>

<p>We cannot even think for a second that this battle is already won by the masses.  It is not by a long shot.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I would hope so, but it will not happen without our continued and <em>conscious</em> movement forward.  We simply CANNOT let up, or we will <em>not</em> come out of it okay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s by no means easy - there&#39;s a <em>ton</em> of counter influence and multi-generation-spanning indoctrination that has to be broken down - but the 99% need to simply throw away all their differences; all the things that they cite as making them &quot;better&quot; and others not as good.  We need to throw away, discard, and reject every religious, political, and social message that deals with alienating and aggressively ostracising groups that are different.</p>

<p>Granted this shouldn&#39;t be taken to an extreme that undermines lawfulness, but all the things that we pride ourselves in setting us apart from others, the 1% easily use against us.</p>

<p>The moment we throw away all indoctrination that teaches us to take undue pride in any advantage or difference that we might have over another is the moment that our eyes will open up and see just how much we have been taken advantage of by the elites.</p>

<p>This, of course, is not the only answer, but it is a huge component responsible for allowing us to keep being manipulated.</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve shed your bias/indoctrination then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of them?  Absolutely not, sir.  This is a very, very difficult thing to do, and I am not here nor have I anywhere ever intentionally even <em>implied</em> that I have reached this level of mastery.</p>

<p>I try, however.  I try.  I know and understand and realize that I am - like all of us - erred, and a mass of seething less than positive emotions often enough.  Many of these emotions have to be checked, and must give way to a consistent push on my part toward intelligence, dialogue, helping, and mutual benefit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you been able to convince others to do so? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot say that I have been able to convince others to do so because I cannot say that I have made any great effort to attempt to convince others of this.  I cannot say that anyone should really try to convince anyone else to do this.  I feel that this is something that we need to do on our own - of our own desire and volition - and not because we are listening to someone telling us we should do this.</p>

<p>This in mind, what I personally DO try to do is simply BE at least <em>some</em> of the change that I wish to see in the world, as it is said.  I try to be as honorable and respectful and loving to everyone I meet and come across as possible.  I also, however, speak my mind, and am not opposed to standing up for someone I see who is being mistreated - whether I know the parties involved or am just walking by and don&#39;t know anyone.</p>

<p>Again, I work toward a level of <em>self</em> mastery first - i.e. not trying to tell anybody what they should or should not do, but, instead, simply doing the best that I can possibly do, and perhaps that might inspire others to attempt to do the best that <em>they</em> can do as well.</p>

<p>This energy catches on as people begin to see your own growing level of self mastery and wish to experience the same energy that you&#39;re experiencing.  If they ask me, then I freely impart what little I know and help where I can.  I also try to keep my ears, eyes, and heart open if someone comes to me and asks me something, as it may ultimately be <em>I</em> who do the most learning in the scenario and is the one taught.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I think they are losing some of their grip judging from the tone of the MSM which seem to continually redefine downward the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;.  I suspect this is by design.  </p>

<p>That lowest common denominator happens to be easily swayed by MSM message pounding but statistically large enough to keep any given issue from reaching a tipping point. Public opinion monitoring and control has become science.  That&#39;s their handle to keep a lid on things - keeping the average couch potato voting block on the sidelines with a steady diet of irrelevant issues and populist fodder. They don&#39;t want everyone else getting together and agreeing on something important. Divide &amp; conquer. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s a symptom of their method but also of their fear as it&#39;s becoming more &amp; more shrill and ignorant. It seems to most thinking people (and to a good bit of the rest of the world) that our national political discourse has collectively lost its mind becoming more and more banal and dumbed down to sound bites and ridiculously transparent spin - but it&#39;s by design.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although he sided with this early on in his speeches, he actually discarded the core of these thoughts later on.</p>

<p>Perhaps you yourself should still be held literally accountable now for the things that you thought were right - when you were a child, or a decade ago, or even last year - that actually ended up not being correct? That way anything you might say now or in the future that might actually be true or have worth will get thoroughly undermined by whatever mistaken thought you had years ago.</p>

<p>All this is to say that while it is not a bad idea to look at the possible contradictions or controversies in anyone&#39;s ideas and proclamations, it is actually much wiser to balance the entirety of an individual&#39;s statements and holistically assess the general direction of their energy.</p>

<p>Anyone looking at what you said here as being indicative of who and what Malcolm X stood for - or, for that matter, looking at your methodology as the way to assess <em>any</em> individual&#39;s worth - will be entirely missing the point of proper, critical assessment, and how to truly judge one&#39;s overall personhood.</p>

It&#39;s interesting how you say he only sided with this &quot;early on in his speeches.&quot;  Cool rhetoric bro.

<p>He <em>never</em> let go of this truth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m seeing now that you are more of a troll by proxy of your ignorance than anyone actually attempting to offer anything of worth in this conversation.</p>

<p>No more troll feeding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally don&#39;t think its has bad as you do (although all you said is true, just missing context). The way I see it, we live in a prime time in history to make big moves. The consent of a nation has been disrupted thanks to the internet and freer and freer exchange of information. Who&#39;d want to live in a Utopia anyways? Ask not for the problem to be easier, but that you&#39;ll become stronger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I&#39;m all for a bloodless revolution that will throw those out of power who have been lording it over the rest of us for so many decades. However I bear in mind that they are good at holding onto power, particularly because they are completely ruthless, and don&#39;t really regard us as human beings equal in importance to themselves. They see us as a commodity to be exploited. I hope we can cast them all down to the dust.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So you&#39;ve shed your bias/indoctrination then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of them?  Absolutely not, sir.  This is a very, very difficult thing to do, and I am not here nor have I anywhere ever intentionally even <em>implied</em> that I have reached this level of mastery.</p>

<p>I try, however.  I try.  I know and understand and realize that I am - like all of us - erred, and a mass of seething less than positive emotions often enough.  Many of these emotions have to be checked, and must give way to a consistent push on my part toward intelligence, dialogue, helping, and mutual benefit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you been able to convince others to do so? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot say that I have been able to convince others to do so because I cannot say that I have made any great effort to attempt to convince others of this.  I cannot say that anyone should really try to convince anyone else to do this.  I feel that this is something that we need to do on our own - of our own desire and volition - and not because we are listening to someone telling us we should do this.</p>

<p>This in mind, what I personally DO try to do is simply BE at least <em>some</em> of the change that I wish to see in the world, as it is said.  I try to be as honorable and respectful and loving to everyone I meet and come across as possible.  I also, however, speak my mind, and am not opposed to standing up for someone I see who is being mistreated - whether I know the parties involved or am just walking by and don&#39;t know anyone.</p>

<p>Again, I work toward a level of <em>self</em> mastery first - i.e. not trying to tell anybody what they should or should not do, but, instead, simply doing the best that I can possibly do, and perhaps that might inspire others to attempt to do the best that <em>they</em> can do as well.</p>

<p>This energy catches on as people begin to see your own growing level of self mastery and wish to experience the same energy that you&#39;re experiencing.  If they ask me, then I freely impart what little I know and help where I can.  I also try to keep my ears, eyes, and heart open if someone comes to me and asks me something, as it may ultimately be <em>I</em> who do the most learning in the scenario and is the one taught.</p>
