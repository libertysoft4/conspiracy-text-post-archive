We HAVE DEMONSTRATED to you our culture and our technology in purely descriptive form - so you cannot convert them or realize them practically. We have done this because we note with sadness that you employ your sciences primarily for war and the destruction of your own selves, which cont[inue] as your principal objective. You are like children playing with terrible and dangerous toys which will destroy you. WE CAN DO NOTHING! A cosmic law says that each world must take its own path, to survive or to perish. You have chosen the second. You are destroying your planet - annihilating your species, and contaminating your atmosphere and your seas until now this is irreversible. With sadness we contemplate your insanity, and understand that the remedy is only in yourselves. We can not look forward a great distance into your future because your psyche are completely unpredictable and capricious bordering on paranoia. As your elder brothers in this cosmos, we urgently desire with all our hearts your salvation. Do not destroy your beautiful blue planet, a rare atmospheric world that floats so majestically in space, so full of life. IT IS YOUR CHOICE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find this quite amusing. Any sort of entity that possible has enough knowledge of our planet would easily realize that we (majority of humans) have absolutely no control over what the few in power do or are capable of doing something to actually cause real change. Therefore we cannot be held accountable for what the people in power do because in reality we have been tricked, lied to and in some cases punished for seeking out truth and knowledge in regards to this. Any sort of life form beyond us with the ability to monitor our planet would see that although we need to mature as one race and evolve to that point we in actuality need to be essentially rescued from those in power. If that was actually a concern for other terrestrial beings then they must not be nearly as smart as us because the second we have actual viable undeniable proof that we are not the only race in space then that very second colour, religion, ethnic background and anything else we can think of to define us from one another simply goes out the window because we would then be united and label as one thing. The human race, there would be us and them and racial and religious segregation would seem a lot more utterly stupid than it already does. I know for one I would love nothing more than to leave everything I ever knew behind and travel around space just doing whatever, I would do it in a heartbeat. When I say I don&#39;t want to live on this planet anymore I literally meant it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;people in power&quot; are those who put themselves in power. Everyone on the planet can be infinitely powerful if they so desire. We are too weak and stupid to govern ourselves we gave our power away to those who can handle it. There is no &quot;shadow beings&quot; that have enslaved humanity, we enslaved ourselves - and nothing will change until we stop blaming the &quot;powers&quot; and take the responsibility on ourselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes no sense, I was born without that option and have no say or option of a say. All I am given is a &quot;vote&quot; every so often which in actuality is useless in regards of causing real change. I didn&#39;t elect those in power yet I am forced to be governed by them so how can I possibly be held responsible for something I have no control over. I could take the violent route and attempt to kill off those I don&#39;t like but then that makes me no better than the ones in power. Maybe your to weak and stupid but people like you need to be governed, like I said before I never asked to be governed and frankly don&#39;t want to be. I&#39;m sure that will just cause me to be labelled which is already one of the things that is devolving us but in reality we have been long fucked and I don&#39;t expect it to change or get better within my lifetime. Not until a good chunk of the masses are either killed off or die from old age.</p>

I want to know these other options that will allow me to govern myself without being affected by what those in power do.

People treat each other poorly. 
The only thing I would guess that asshole was hinting at was maybe if we took a more aggressive stance at showing others what&#39;s up. 
Not a violent stance but a path of reason to lead others down.

    <div class="md"><p>I do take a stance at showing others whats up, hence the reason I post so much on reddit instead of looking at stupid cat pics and posting whatever gay status comes to mind on facebook, I spend time here being constructive and informative. If the idiot took the time to check my posts he&#39;d see I&#39;m veryy outspoken about 9/11 but not in a conspiracy sort of way, but looking at it from a engineering point of view. Furthermore I don&#39;t have to be nearly as kind as I am, and requesting that someone explain themselves when all they are doing is picking apart posts they didn&#39;t understand doesn&#39;t make me an asshole. For all I know he could just have been one of the many government spooks that post here just to hassle people for no real reason in order to try and dumb down the seriousness of some of the posts here and attempting to discourage others from asking questions.</p>

<p>As for why not they just proclaim themselves our overlords...
