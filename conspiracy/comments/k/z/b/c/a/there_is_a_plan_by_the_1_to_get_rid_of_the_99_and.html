I think this plan goes right well along with their philosophy. I am starting to wonder if its possible that very soon, Hitlers doings will seem like a walk through the park, because of these people. The thing is, if this is so, we need to do something NOW. Not in a year, not when its obvious whats going on, because it really is 99% of humanity that would be at stake. We need to reign in these people.</p>

<p>The resource wars are completely unnecessary. So if war continues to be waged for profit (as is happening right now) and oil, it is feasible that a large amount of the population could be eliminated. </p>

<p>After, say, World War 3, would they put an end to oil and create (space-)solar, geothermal infrastructures or continue to wreck the planet with methods like mountaintop removal mining and disastrous deep drilling? An interesting conundrum that speaks of the hypocrisy in our world today. </p>
