<p>If you go to r/politicsnew or r/worldnews/new you won&#39;t see a lot of submissions critical of Israel or the Israel Lobby in the US.</p>

<p>Take a look at the newest submissions to r/politics that the moderators will allow you to see:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/new">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/new</a><br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Nowhere will you see this submission which was made a shortwhile ago:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kjtr2/glenn_greenwald_the_mainstreaming_of_walt_and/">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/kjtr2/glenn_greenwald_the_mainstreaming_of_walt_and/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This kind of quiet Zionist-oriented censorship has become routine at both r/politics and r/worldnews lately. It began when the moderator lineup changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason is simple enough. The r/politics subreddit has three-quarters of a million subscribers. It&#39;s considered by the Zionists to be mainstream. By contrast r/conspiracy and r/worldnews have less than 40,000 subscribers each. They are niche subreddits. R/Conspiracy is considered by most people (who don&#39;t know it) to be nothing more than a nutball subreddit, so the Zionists don&#39;t mind if we post accurate news about Israel here ... but they don&#39;t want any truth showing up on r/politics because it reaches 22 times as many viewers. I&#39;m a bit surprised they bother censoring r/worldnews, but maybe it&#39;s because the name of the group suggests that it is mainstream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The clever thing Zionists have done is to use the tax monies paid by the American taxpayer to fund their propaganda wars, and also to bleed out more US tax money. They don&#39;t even have to fund their propaganda campaign out of their own pockets. Did you read the story about all the Jewish organizations getting free security upgrades to all their offices and community centers? What a joke, considering there is no security threat, other than maybe from an occasional Mossad bomb team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not saying your wrong/right but this is the 9th story in r/politics:</p>

<p>Tom Friedman in NY Times: the US government is Israel&#39;s &quot;hostage&quot; and &quot;the powerful pro-Israel lobby can force the administration to defend Israel&quot;, not exactly a Pro-Israel title (I am not talking about the article just the title), and the article you are referencing above is mentioned in the comments and has 3 up votes and is visible. Just to  be clear I am no fan of r/politics and I do think the mods do some shady things there.</p>

<p>On a different note the more interesting thing I think is if you compare the main stories in r/politics with r/conspiracy right now they have several similarities, this Occupy Wall Street is being pushed hard in both of them, ron paul winning the straw poll, social security issues, yesterday there was a meme post on raise taxes on the rich</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was reading a post over in Theory of Reddit earlier that gave the impression that everything posted to r/politics, except for the mods posts and their list of approved posters, by default is labeled spam. Therefore unless the OP notices and complains they never realize what the deal is and it is left up to the mods to release it at their discretion.

<p>The fact that you can setup a site, or post a comment, anywhere to say anything is exactly how it should be.</p>

<p>I am sure though there are many efforts to prove the internet provides a pulpit from which racism/anti-semitism/national security secrets can be shouted and thus should be controlled (thus the efforts of recent to frame cyber attacks on lulzsec, anon, etc..)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, they don&#39;t quite own the Internet. Yet. They are doing everything in their power to rectify that situation, however. Unless some kind of rules are put into place insuring diversity, all the main sites will be bought up, and once they own them, they start to exert their social and political filters over them, just as they do over television, radio, popular music, books, magazines and movies. We&#39;ve probably only got a few more years to make our voices heard, before the bastards smother us all. They will control Google, so you won&#39;t even be able to find truly independent and truthful sites, even if they manage to survive. The pressure is very subtle, but it is unrelenting. It&#39;s the kind of pressure a gardener puts on a tree to make it grow crooked. He doesn&#39;t want to kill the tree, so he takes his time, but he never allows the tree to stand up straight. That the kind of pressure the Zionists exert over the media to twist it to their purposes.</p>
