    <div class="md"><p>Only the astronauts and a handful of camera operators need to be in on it.</p>

<p>Also, the moon surface is fine powder.  You can tell from the &quot;first step&quot; photo.</p>

<p>Then why when the Apollo lander landed on the surface it wasn&#39;t inside of a small crater?  There was massive amounts of thrust being used to land safely on the surface of the moon.</p>

<p>And with 1/6 the gravity, they would need a rocket 1/6 the size of Saturn v to launch off the moon to get back to the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re just not getting it.  400,000 people (yes that many) worked on that project over 10 years.   Moonlanding truthers basically propose that you can get nearly half a million people to lie about the same thing consistent with each other.   </p>

<p>Which is more likely to you, getting 400k people from all over the world to join in a great big hoax (and never come forward about the hoax, to date), or sending a manned ship to the moon?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>They are compartmentalized.  Only the high ups, the planners, know whats going on.</p>

<p>I ignored pseudoscience but ok I&#39;ll entertain your idea. </p>

<p>Lunar lander - 2 stages - one stage left behind - other stage proceeds on its trajectory.  Go to your local university and ask a mathematician or astrophysicist to crunch the numbers for you, maybe that will convince you.   Tell them you&#39;re a moonlanding truther and I&#39;m sure they will be all the more happy to give you information.</p>

<p>The fact is that any one with the math and physics can show just how possible the moon landing was.. I suppose they are in on the hoax too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only 17 Saturn Vs were made, and they&#39;re all accounted for.  No other rocket could send the Apollo spacecraft and lander to the moon.</p>

<p>To build another takes tens of thousands of people.  The first stage is built by one company, the first stage engines by another, the second stage by another, the second stage engines by another, the interstage ring with the computers by another, right up to the Apollo command module and lander being made by two more companies.</p>

<p>To transport it to Florida, assemble it, roll it out to the pad, fuel and launch it takes thousands of people.</p>

<p>As you roll ot out to the pad, many thousands of people will see it.  (Try hiding a distinctive 30-story building on the Florida coast.)</p>

<p>Now you need thousands more people to launch it.  And thousands more to run the mission.</p>

<p>And hundreds of thousands of people will see the launch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nowadays the average space journey goes about 200 miles from the surface of the earth. Why is it that a journey about 1000 times further than this took roughly the same amount of fuel that today&#39;s shorter missions take. This is why I want NASA to design my next car, I&#39;d never have to fill it again as long as I live.</p>

<p>Also why have NASA 700 containers of film from the moon landings, why have NASA lost all the other data from the Apollo missions, also why has NASA lost all the blueprints for the miraculous rocket and lander technology used in the Apollo missions so there is absolutely no way of verifying the technology in the modern time. The fact is people like you simply get off on telling people they&#39;re stupid for believing in something, and its actually a defence mechanism arising from the fact they are feeling inferior after being told what they&#39;ve believed all their life is a lie.</p>

<p>People like me??  You won&#39;t examine evidence contrary to your point, and you clearly know nothing about astrophysics (actually considering a space journey&#39;s length as a fuel factor... just wow.)  So don&#39;t yell at me for being in a bubble, I examined moontruther &quot;evidence&quot; and it is insufficient to say the least.  </p>

<p>You yourself just attempted to use missing data to prove your extraordinary claim..  Sounds just like religious dogma to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As the saying goes, once you get to low earth orbit (LEO) you&#39;re half-way to anywhere in the solar system.  Once you use a bit more fuel to boost beyond LEO, you coast all the way to the moon without using any fuel.  You can coast 1000 times farther, or 1,000,000 times farther - if you have the time - without using more fuel.  You&#39;re in a vacuum.  There&#39;s no friction.  You just keep going.</p>

<p>All the Apollo blueprints still exist.  It&#39;s an urban myth that they were destroyed.  In fact they took the time to videotape some Apollo engineers before they retired, to give some lessons for later rocket scientists.  The jigs for bending metal for the Saturn rockets are still at the Michoud facility.</p>

<p>Likewise the film still exists.  All that was lost - and much of it later found - was the higher definition version of the video transmitted from the moon.  And even that was for good reason:  Once received at the ground station, all they could do is transfer it to standard video and re-transmit it - because standard video is all anyone could work with.  It was also stored on tape, but VERY few others had the tape drives that could read it or video equipment that could display it.  With NASA&#39;s budget being slashed even before the first landing, archiving the verion that no-one could work with or view wasn&#39;t a priority.</p>

<p>Watch <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Moon_machines">Moon Machines</a>, they talk with the engineers and they talk about the technology with the people who built everything.</p>

<p>Fact is I&#39;m not telling you you&#39;re stupid, but how about you provide some evidence of it being fake rather than putting the burden on others to explain anomalies. I&#39;ve exposed a few your weak arguments.</p>
