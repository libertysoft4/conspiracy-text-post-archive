        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The biggest conspiracy is that you are not perfect, now, already as you are.  That there is something you need to learn before you can be perfect, or that you need forgiveness for anything that you have done.  The only person you need forgiveness from is yourself.</p>

<p>Look, we all were blinded at birth, by choice.  This blindness, veil, is something we do for ourselves, because without it there would be no surprises, no chance to fail, and also no opportunity to succeed.  It is when you are your authentic self that life becomes a glorious ride.  When you stop doubting yourself, then you can see that everything and anything can be yours, all you need to is take the reigns in your hands and make it so.  God is inside you, he/she/it speaks to you thru your heart, if you would but listen.  Your heart is your authentic self speaking to you, directing you.  It is self doubt that holds you back, and nothing else.  There is no one on this planet that can keep you from achieving whatever you set out to do.  </p>

<p>If anyone claims they have more information than you, they are lying.  They are using the fact that they know you don&#39;t, and all they are doing is faking it.  The conspiracy is that there are those that have chosen to do the one thing they have no right to do, control you.  And the only way they can do that is with your willing compliance.  It is only in your self doubt that they even have a chance.</p>

<p>In wasting our time looking at what they are doing, we are in effect allowing them to direct our thoughts.  Your mind is a powerful tool that will help you do whatever it is you set out to do.  And no matter the outside circumstance you see around you, just remember we are in this together, yet somehow, by the unlimited power that is God, is Life...  all people get exactly what they desire.</p>

<p>Stop believing that anything happens without you asking for it.  Start paying attention to what you think about.</p>

<p>We get sick because we don&#39;t take care of our bodies, our environment, our thoughts.  But I tell you we can change all that, by working together and choosing for things to be different.  Until that day comes, become sovereign unto yourself.  Your fate is only what you make it.</p>

<p>You can learn to control you mind before you get a disease.    Stress is the major cause of physical problems.  Worry is a major cause of stress.  Not properly taking care of your body.  If you don&#39;t stretch, move, and exercise your body everyday you leave it in a weakened condition.  When I help animals, I take them for walks regularly.  I go as far as they can, then the next day we do it again.  I let the dog tell me how it wants to go, dogs never lie, if they feel good they will get up and be ready to go.  ANIMALS NEVER LIE.  Humans do, we need to say yes to life, we need to be more like dogs.  I have taken a dog that could barely get around the block and return her condition to a very happy level for a twelve year old dog. She now enjoys walking around a lake with me, and occasionally running. Dogs have limited ability only because they lack imagination, but we can help them achieve far beyond what they would normally be capable of.  Just watch how some people have trained their animals.  I&#39;d also have you notice that you&#39;ve never seen an animal in its natural habitat that was out of shape.</p>

<p>YOUR IMAGINATION IS THE MOST POWERFUL TOOL YOU HAVE</p>

<p>The key is consistency.  If you want to be healthy you need to get off your ass and do something about it.  IMAGINE THAT YOU CAN BE HEALTHY.  Having a physical body means you need to take care of it.  You&#39;ll be surprised at how your attitude/energy level increases with more physical activity.  But as with anything balance is key, if you push yourself to far everyday without proper rest, then again, you are inviting sickness into your life.  If you drink alcohol, smoke cigs, you are stressing your system.  Now I have done both of these things, and I feel the strain on my system, it requires me to work harder than I normally would to stay healthy, but in and of themselves all they do is lower my energy.  <strong>I have a brother that ran a marathon and still smoked over a pack a day</strong>  I am very sensitive to my bodies needs, when I need rest I sleep, and nothing in this world will keep me from that sleep.  My health is the most important thing, without it LIFE SUCKS.  I will not ruin my body for money and neither should you.</p>

<p>If you pay attention, you&#39;ll hear people say things when they get a running nose..  they will say, I think I&#39;m coming down with something!  Or they cough, and think they have a cold.  In many cases sickness is about you ignoring your bodyThey talk about sickness all the time.  If I have a running nose, perhaps my sinuses are full, or perhaps it is the weather, in either case I don&#39;t consider it a problem.  If my sinuses are full, I take a hot shower and clear them up as soon as I can, or go sit in a steam room/sauna.  Another thing I do is if I cough something up, I spit it out, this has taken care of the sore throats I used to get as a child. </p>

<p>If you hate someone, you may get your revenge, but in the end the stress you cause yourself as you think all those horrible things you want to do to that other person is like asking the Universe for the similar experiences.  Wake up to your own power!  It is insane to think of hurting someone else, because you can&#39;t do it without hurting yourself.  Are they really worth it?  I watch True Grit, and the first thing I think when it ends is... she lost her arm to kill a loser.  Was it worth it?  Not in my mind, I understand that such a miserable wretch is actually given a lighter sentence by your ending his life prematurely.  And had he turned his life around, would you still want to kill him?  He was just as blind as you, and he was doing his best from his perspective, you are not here to teach others that kind of lesson.  Forgetting and forgiving is something you do for yourself.</p>

<p>People that think healthy are healthier, period.  </p>

<p>There are plenty of stories of miracles, by the way...  miraculous healings that doctors can&#39;t explain..  these are consider anomalous, lucky people.  Just look of the <a href="http://www.themiracleman.org/w_movie.htm">Miracle Man</a>... there is a perfect example of man that was destroyed physically, doctors told him he would never walk or breathe on his own again, yet he walks and talks.  Why isn&#39;t it from page news?  Why aren&#39;t people celebrating?  You could also look up Mirin Dajo the Wonderman from Germany that could be pierced with blades, there is even a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QA-XHx2VF8">video of it being done</a>, and doctors x-ray him with the swords inside him. </p>

<p>Everything is made of the energy of God. There is nothing that is not God, God is all there is.</p>

<p>You have a choice, to come from Love or Fear. This duality makes this world possible, for without it, there would be no choice at all. While I bless the darkness for making choice possible, this blackhole that we have created is being experienced as suffering. When the suffering gets great enough more will wake up. If people would only listen, but they do not, they want not. Such as it is, nothing is wrong, everything is perfect, we have infinity, time is not a limited in any sense of the word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is correct IMHO, and I have been trying to live and spread this lifestyle all my life so far, which is one of self determination and absolute free will for myself and those around me.  Humans are much more powerful than we give ourselves credit for.  I consider myself an atheist and to some extent also believe MUFC_CHAMP19NS that we may have been created by intelligence(s) far greater than we can perceive or even acknowledge.  So what?  Will it change what you do tomorrow?  One thing is certain, we cannot escape the ISness that IS now.  Yeah I&#39;ve seen The Secret, I didn&#39;t see it as a revelation.  I&#39;ve seen &#39;What the Bleep Do We Know&#39; and countless other &#39;self help&#39; movies, doco&#39;s and books.  There are common themes running through all of these that relate directly to the OP&#39;s message.  Why the coincidences?  Do you think the authors realise that we gullible saps will pay money to hear the same thing over and over again and just ride the gravy train of gullible all the way to the bank?  The giving and receiving of knowledge like this for free or otherwise will continue forever, and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  It is inherent in us all.  Without getting too philosophical, to have intent about something is to will an outcome into existence.  Our quantum physicists are just beginning to understand there is no such thing as true nothingness.  Our perceptive universe and understanding of 3 dimensional space time presents us with the fact that potential is everywhere and all around us at all times.  Is Schrödinger&#39;s cat in the box?  When I move my arm from one position to the next, did my arm physically move through space-time or was it deconstructed on a quantum level and reassembled and rebuilt by my will alone through a process we are only now beginning to scratch the surface of?  We create our existence from thought alone, positive or negative is subjective you see, it can only be judged in retrospect when combining it with the rest of our 3 dimensional lives, so our individual experiences are reflections of us in the 4th dimension.  Nothing can reach macro status without coming first from the micro, from intent.
I&#39;ve always taken charge of my life.  Right now I have begun to sell everything I own.  I am quitting my job soon and I am planning on walking around this planet backpacking for the next 18 months.  I know I will not be received everywhere I go with open arms, but that will not stop me from walking towards my destinations with open arms and an open heart, which I will be projecting every step of the way.  I have not once considered myself a wage slave as I have always earned my remuneration doing something I very much enjoy since childhood.  I&#39;m healthy and somewhat fit even though I don&#39;t exercise.  I drink booze like an alcoholic, smoke pot like an ent and I wake every morning looking at myself in the mirror visualizing myself as if every cell in my body is perfect, which is and has always been a daily ritual for as long as I can remember.  I&#39;ve never had a major sickness, sick days are reserved for hangovers mostly, which is cause and effect really.  I do not give other humans power over myself and my will.  I choose my path, I choose my destiny.<br/>
Give it a serious contemplative try for a month or two, you may surprise yourself.  I&#39;m not saying you should talk yourself into a self delusional state, start small and maybe inconsequential.  Be aware of coincidences in your life relating to your quest as you train your vastly powerful will and you will slowly learn when to nudge the universe&#39;s ebb and flow to work for you.  Condescending much?  Well, I have had a wonderful almost 40 years behind me.  I am looking forward to the millions yet to come.  What have you got to lose?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a band called Fishbone that put out an album called <strong>The Reality of my Surroundings</strong>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not their best CD but the title always stuck with me.</p>

<p>Your upbringing, your environment, your friends, relatives, educational facilities all help to define your life. If your environment is sick, you&#39;re going to be unhealthy.</p>

<p>Take gated communities versus trailer parks. Rich people are lazy too but they eat better, have more access to sports, better education which teaches them more self reliance and improves their standard of living.</p>

<p>Poor people can still eat well but if your only outlet to the outside world is your tv, you&#39;re not going to learn the tricks needed to stay healthy.</p>

<p>If poor people who lived in the ghetto had access and will to do better, they could, but they&#39;re stigmatized culturally and lack the resources to help them do better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your good intentions but a lot of this is unsubstantiated feel good nonsense.</p>

<p>Positive thinking and being active are important ingredients to success, but these in and of themselves are not the only necessary ingredients. </p>

<p>This is all very nice to believe, but reality is more complicated than some axiomatic phrases about our limitless potential.</p>

<p>Mysticism and spirituality are nice if that&#39;s what you need to make yourself believe something in order to achieve it. You force God into the conversation, then you cite a video of a man from a bygone era performing a magic trick. There are extreme types of body training and etc that allow people to successfully achieve some dangerous/elaborate feats. Any sufficiently complicated technique is magic to a laymen.</p>

<p>There are certainly nuggets of wisdom here but I take it with a grain of salt, just like anything else. </p>

<p>What exactly holds together your worldview? You believe we are gods but then you use &quot;God&quot; and etc in another sense. I&#39;m curious.</p>

<p>The farther we collectively swing to one pole of the duality you mention... the farther we rebound to the other.  I think no one stays on one side or the other.  It all evens out.  </p>

<p>But currently it does seem like we are collectively on a downtrend.  The uptrend should be epic whenever it happens!</p>

<p>Your characterization of &quot;Love or Fear&quot; I think may be a bit off in regards to defining the duality, but I know where your coming from...</p>

<p>No, the duality can be transcended, and the illusion can become something that we all recognize as such.  It is still &#39;possible&#39; but given the amount of Light/Love it becomes nearly impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to agree with that statement but I do not. I feel sure this will be blamed on the limitations I set upon myself... and that may be true. I just feel like there are certain limitations in this life.  You offset the balance and re-balancing will occur.  I do not view this as a bad thing. It keeps us from being jaded and allows for true joy.</p>

<p>A bullet from another persons hate filled reality can still enter yours and restore the balance no matter how much you don&#39;t want it too. There are people/forces that will hate you just because you love.  Your concepts are noble...  Thoughts like yours help to collectively shift us back to love.  Thank you :)</p>

<p>No.  After all I&#39;ve learned it seems once something is named then people think they know it.  If anything it is that I quest for Truth at all costs, and do not shy away from that which makes me uncomfortable.</p>

<p>It is very hard to be scientific when what you expect is what you find.  But in so applying my theory I&#39;ve found that it is indeed true, so for me it makes sense to expect what I want so I will find it.</p>

<p>It just bothers me that this world could be so perfect and prosperous, but no one wants to let it happen. People want to argue over trivial shit all day long and further divide themselves. If everyone lived with love and understanding we could all live harmoniously.</p>

<p>In one sense you are correct, this division was desired, because without it there would be only oneness, and from that no experience can be had.  We are meant to be autonomous wonderful creators of our own experience, just some became embittered by the experience, misunderstanding the true purpose, and redefined it based upon false assumptions.  Unfortunately in our innocence many accepted the authority of others and disregarded their own.  </p>

<p>But things are speeding up now, and it is becoming harder to lie to ourselves that what we are experience is truly chaos and not the product of our thoughts.  The awakening is inevitable, for God never wanted to remain in the dark forever, all will remember, all will return in the end.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True but we need to learn to be divided in interest but one as a whole. The world should and needs to be full of diversity for it all to work, but the problem that arises in modern society is that our diversity is not coming from love and understanding, its coming from a root of fear and close mindedness. The media force feeds us images and stories of terrible things that happen in the world, leaving everyone feeling afraid, and end up thinking the entire world is a hostile place that we should be fearing. So when everyone lives in fear, people end up <em>assuming</em> that the next person they see on the street is out to get them and vice-versa. Not only that but it is emulated on a grand scale with religions and other nations. </p>

<p>I think that is solved easily by acting from your heart, we each have different desires inherently, it really isn&#39;t something we need to work at ;)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It is funny, the only way to overcome that fear is to go out into the world and find out that people really do just want to be happy.  I&#39;ve had so many experiences of &#39;strangers&#39; helping me I find it insane.  I think the last straw for me was seeing this big burly guy, covered in tattoos, standing in line in front of me at a amusement park.  I admit, I was a bit afraid, but then a little girl appears all excited about this stuffed animal, and this big &#39;scary&#39; man bends down and treats this little girl with a tenderness that touch me, I saw him smile, her giggle... </p>

<p>I think you see what I see, I am excited for the day that we stop pretending that the ridiculous ideas in our head our true and instead we go over and talk to those people we are afraid of.</p>

<p>Bullshit, nothing I&#39;ve said here would lead anyone to declare themselves superior, and that is what zionism and Israel are doing.  They all understand their power, and they like that others are in the dark and feel no need to help them, since they consider themselves chosen ones, and the rest are less than they.

<p>Yes, we are the creators within our own experience, but something (God) created the game.  I don&#39;t pretend to think that I created the beauty of this earth, or its magnificence tectonic plates and how everything renews and refreshes itself.  The game was started by God, for God, and we are on a path of remembrance, and God blessed us with the ability to become conscious of consciousness itself.</p>

<p>Something definitely creates reality.  The divine geometry that is everywhere is the fingerprint of God.  I do not see chaos in nature, instead I see divine order.  What I see happening with the human race is a result of the awakening.</p>

<p>This is budda&#39;s take on life, and he&#39;d have you rid yourself of all desire.  I have done this, and it left me with nothing and I was extremely bored.

    <div class="md"><p>God is all things.  Including you and me.</p>

<p>Since God is you, it only makes sense that he/she/it would care about you, in a very personal sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And to go against one&#39;s nature is to go against the teachings of zen, sure you can be good at anything, we adapt, but complacency does not make sense to me, if you truly took it in, you would not bother going against your grain to prove anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do what I do because I want to do it, and if I want to do it then it is in my nature.  I have seen there are things I naturally like, and things I don&#39;t, and really they haven&#39;t changed much over time.  So I think we agree, it was rather a misunderstanding of your meaning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>like all chemical interactions it will wear off and/or is completely ignorable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I can ignore it, why would I want to?  Why throw away such a beautiful gift?</p>

<p>I think to detach yourself from everyone before they die is just like the people that fall in love once, get hurt, and swear off love as if it where a bad thing.  No, I choose to see the pain I experience as joyful representation of how much that person affected me, and left an imprint, so that when they left I felt the hole.  Now I will also say that I fully understand that death is not the end, so I am joyful for them, that they have moved onto their next journey.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I don&#39;t disagree, family is a choice, and one I enjoy.</p>

1. A person&#39;s sense of self-esteem or self-importance: &quot;a boost to my ego&quot;.
2. The part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing and a sense of personal identity.</p>

<p>I think you need a healthy ego, it has been to long demonized as the enemy.  It is my self-esteem, confidence, in my ability to learn anything, that has given me such strength.  It has given me the will to reach out and learn, and at the same time it was this very ego, with a strong sense of curiosity, that drove me to meditate, and learn about God.  While I can understand that an over-inflated ego, me thinking I&#39;m better, is a undesirable, a completely deflated ego, would leave me flopping like a fish, thinking I was worthless and incapable of changing the conditions of my life.</p>

<p>Exactly. As you say, he/she/it does not want a slave. However, He does want a willing servant. Would your will be strong enough to be crucified if it was asked of you? I suspect no. I also suspect you have not attained everything that life is offering you. Which brings us to this point...</p>

<p>What I am saying (and what Christ says) is that I wish one day you will see the kingdom of God. How can there be ill will in that?

Perhaps you have seen the kingdom, but if you had, you would understand the teachings of Jesus. (in many ways you do, not a slam by any means)</p>

<p>my bad on being sloppy. gnosis is a &quot;secret knowledge&quot; that one cannot get by reading a book. A knowledge that accumulates into what we call wisdom. Have you read the gnostic scriptures? In it Jesus describes a heaven that can be found on Earth and available to all who seek it. Have you also heard of the trinity? If interested I will do my best to describe it (I gotta go now). I suspect you would understand it if I did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read a ton of your stuff. Love it. If i may throw this out and see what you think. As you know, the trinity is the father, son, and holy ghost. The father is the big G. No point in trying to understand Him, but one thing we do know is that nature and God must be the same thing. It can&#39;t be otherwise. The son is the fleshy part of us that hangs around this dumpster we created called Earth. And the holy ghost is (I&#39;m going to ask someone far older and wiser on this one) a force that is a binding, metaphysical and ubiquitous power that connect everything in the universe. Least that&#39;s what Yoda tells me, and my experience confirms the truth in this. I believe we are saying the same thing, but with different terminologies. </p>

<p>In any case, nice meeting you. Also, if you liked the gnostic gospels may I recommend Hyperion by Dan Simmons. Same message done scify way. Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is far simpler.  God is all that is.  God divided itself into infinite number of souls, yet the division is only an illusion.  Within the illusion we are the incarnation of our souls.  Now I do see us as being three part beings, which is what I think the trinity idea really pointing at, body, mind and soul.  The soul is the master, but very much like God, but it is not the entirety of God.  The body is very much like a child, it retains its innocence permanently, and believes whatever the mind says is Truth.</p>

<p>The mind is what is being developed here, it is given all the power to create as it will, and I think this is done because the soul doesn&#39;t want a servant, but a willing companion, an so the soul waits, the soul waits for the mind to do everything it can, until the mind finally gives up in frustration upon realizing it doesn&#39;t have enough information, and in a way experiences a death as it turns its will over and begins to listen to the soul.  The mind, now realizing it is just a tool, but a wonderful magnificent, awesome tool, becomes a partner to the soul.  in listening to the soul, the mind finds things work so much simpler and easier than ever before, as I have found, and you want to do the will of the soul/God, for the soul never left God&#39;s presence, and resides in the realm of the absolute, it still on the otherside and has access to all things all the time.  Hence when you act from your soul, you will be in alignment with all things, and amazing coincidences start happening in your life.</p>

<p>that is how I&#39;ve come to understand it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an Indian mythology that is very similar to what you&#39;ve put forth. From that, I could conclude you regurgitated a response. The other possibility is that you are tapping into something that has been around since man could communicate. But that&#39;s just crazy talk...I mean, that would be the BIGGEST conspiracy ever!</p>

<p>Just to add...My description of the holy spirit left something to be desired. What Yoda describes we callthe world of quantum mechanics and entanglement. A reverse matrix so to speak.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep looking for that story from India mythology and pass it on. There are so many!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, being an atheist this doesn&#39;t do a whole lot for me. If anything, I just think you&#39;re the unrealistic type who has gave into religion or self-help books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was an atheist, and it was after reading stephen hawkins &#39;universe in a nutshell&#39; and bill bryson&#39;s &#39;a brief history of nearly everything&#39; that a light bulb just click for me, and I saw how perfectly everything fit together...  And now that I think about it I had just read the DaVinci Code, that opened some doors into the fact we have been lied to on so many levels about reality.  Of course it is ironic that I now consider the Davinci code a lie LOL, but it served its purpose.</p>

<p>If you play golf, you could read &#39;zen golf&#39; that book really helped me learn to master my mind (and improved by disc golf and regular golf game).  If you hate god because of the christian theology... well just understand that is not the god of my understanding.  My God needs nothing, not your worship, your money, or even your obedience.  My God wants you to be yourself, and never condemns, and loves you very much.</p>

<p>Best of luck to you on your journey, it is perfect for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the value in suffering to teach others to not want to inflict it upon others, the learning of compassion, empathy.  But I no longer see it having any value in my life.</p>

<p>Are you really saying if we went on a skiing trip, someone needs to get hurt, and only then would we realize what a good time I was having?  No, I firmly disagree that such things &#39;need&#39; to be present to experience joy.</p>
