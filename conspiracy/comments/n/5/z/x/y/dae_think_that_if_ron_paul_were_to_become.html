    <div class="md"><p>but RP has repeatedly said that he would take no position on Israel&#39;s behavior in the middle east and around the world.  i believe the term he frequently uses is &quot;unshackle&quot; Israel... as if they were imprisoned by American diplomatic mandate to not be evil.  i definitely agree that RP is a better choice than every other Presidential candidate being force fed to the American public via our 4th branch lying media... still though, his free market theories would not help the people in a day and age where the free market has turned into the casino and speculation has caused our hard assets to depreciate astronomically.  </p>

However, it could be a greatest fear as well, with all of the insane shit and laws being passed, if RP doesn&#39;t make it to the presidency we should all consider leaving this country for our own safety.

    <div class="md"><p>I remember right after Obama won the election, the news reported that he is &quot;off to the White House for a three day briefing&quot; or something and that he would be &quot;out of the public eye&quot; for that time. I remember thinking that the law is probably being laid down as to just how this Presidency thing really works. I&#39;ve also wondered what is really going on with all these vacations. It just seems to me that all the &quot;vacations&quot; might be more of a cover for other things (secret meetings?) and it surprises me that so few people tend to question that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, this is trivial speculation. You&#39;re assuming a lot of things. If Ron Paul is to be President, I think it will take more than just an election (we&#39;ve seen how easily they can be manipulated, electronically or otherwise). And at that point, the People would have to be so empowered- harmonized with the Armed Forces in a <em>peaceful</em> resolution- that the parties that benefit from such an assassination would be vastly stripped of power.</p>

<p>The CIA has changed. It used to be civilian run, and now for the first time, it&#39;s run by an army general. Instead of intelligence gathering, we&#39;re now seeing our agents actively engaged in special operations all over the world. My pessimism tells me that this shift can&#39;t be good for the anti-war crowd...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is a civilian, he retired from the army.  The shift you are talking about happened after 9/11.  The operations side all of a sudden got a lot more attention and started working much more closely with JSOC.</p>

<p>That being said, all that has changed is the director and his staff.  You still have to go through the same avenues to approve operations and the president still has to sign off on all findings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968, I believe those who performed such public, high level killings shifted to discrediting and ruining people before they come to power.  For instance, Ted Kennedy in 1969 and the Chappaquiddick affair.  Although I believe these same forces are behind 9/11, I don&#39;t think Ron Paul would be assassinated.  I think the vote would be rigged or some other method employed simply to keep him out of the running.  After all, the will of the people means nothing to those in power.</p>
