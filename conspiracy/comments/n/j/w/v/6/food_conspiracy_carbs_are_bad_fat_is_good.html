That is that fat is good for you, and carbs are bad.  This is a conspiracy you can actually act on, check it out <a href="http://www.dietdoctor.com/lchf">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are so many government agencies that push for you to eat carbs and exercise, but people shouldn&#39;t gain weight naturally, they should stay lean.  A low carb diet keeps you lean.  By fattening people up, it sells carbs, medicine, and eventually hospitalization.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>carbs and fat are both good for you and are needed in regulating the bodies systems. The brain itself requires a certain number of &quot;carbs&quot; per day, hence why when someone goes on a ketogenic diet their mental functions are actually proven to be slower. </p>

<p>from a personal training background clean carbs are my best friend. finding clean carbs is hard to do though in this FDA/GMO food run United states. </p>

<p>Most of my days amount of carbs come right after a work out. All other meals actually have small amounts of fatty acids. Coconut oil and water is the best way to get high energy boosts naturally. </p>

<p>Carbs are not bad though. stop spreading misinformation. Your title is misleading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carbs are actually bad though.  Carbs directly result in weight gains, and are not needed for your brain.</p>

<p>Your body can either use fats or carbs as an energy source.  When the body digests carbs, that gets converted into sugars.  The pancreas then produces more insulin to balance out the added sugars.  Insulin happens to be the hormone that promotes fat growth.</p>

<p>I may not be very good at explaining this, but I found <a href="http://www.dietdoctor.com/lchf">this</a> is much better at it.  </p>

<p>Ask yourself the question: Why are Americans increasingly getting fatter?  Shouldn&#39;t the nutrient recommendations, recommendations that have been in place for the past 30 years, have helped?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Someone needs to straighten this out. Ok carbs are sugars. There are many different types of sugars just like there are many different types of fats. Basic sugars power your cells and are necessary for energy. Proteins are necessary to help rebuild muscle and tissue. Fats( good ones) help you absorb minerals and vitamins through your stomach wall and transport them through other parts of your body. First things first. Very simply you needs calories to live. Calories is nothing more than the measurement of food energy. If you eat more calories than your body burns then it&#39;ll most likely become extra weight.Fruits are made up of mostly sugars but noone will claim that eating an Apple is the same as eating table sugar. How quickly sugar is used by your body is based off how refined that sugar is. If you eat very refined sugars( high fructose corn syrup, table sugar, refined starches like pasta/ white bread)  then your body process them quickly turning them into energy or stored energy( fat) but leaves you hungry much faster so you eat more. When you consume complex sugars ( fruits /veggies, whole grain products, raw whole foods). It takes your body a lot longer to break down and use this energy due to it being less refined and having fiber integrated into the sugar.(fiber cannot be broken down by stomach)  this means your body gets longer lasting balanced energy and no insulin spike as well as vitamins and colon cleaning fibre. Most obese people are nutrient deficient because the food they eat contains refined sugars that have to nutritional value. Now protein is neccesary to rebuild tissue and build muscle. It can be used as calories too but a longer process is required to convert it to a usable sugar. This is why atkins type diets kinda work. The process though creates excess ammonia that is hard on your kidneys.natural fats are great for you and help you absorb vitamins and minerals.processed fats are the issue. When fats are fried or hydrogenated they turn into trans fats and polyunsaturated fats. Your body cannot use these and it clog up your system. Natural fats like raw flax seed oil, hemp oil, fish oil, olive oil, etc. When in a non processed form contain omega 3 and 6 as well as others that are beneficial to health. You should always try to avoid fried foods and margarine that is hydrogenated. Anyway I think I&#39;ve covered a lot. Please let me know if you have any food related questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When your body processes sugars of any form (all carbs), it makes you hungrier faster.  While complex sugars don&#39;t give you a insulin spike, they give you more of an insulin hill.  While on a low carb high fat diet, insulin stays pretty much constant.</p>

<p>Atkins diet, which is a low carb diet, pushes for you to consume more protein than carbs.  If a person went low carb, low fat, high protein, it could be dangerous for them, since the body would then be forced to process protein for fuel (and it doesn&#39;t differentiate between muscle and consumed protein).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not so much a conspiracy as it is a profit motive using the pseudo-science of nutritionism as evidence. Non-processed plant based diet, drink filtered water = health but you can&#39;t sell that. There&#39;s nothing to buy b/c it&#39;s not profitable. Basically eat plants (the highest quality you can get) if you can help it. You&#39;ll have optimal health. No book or study needed (but you can read the China Study if you need statistics). This has been an open secret for thousands of years but it&#39;s not a profitable venture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Vegetarian Myth details this conspiracy as &quot;The lipid hypothesis&quot;.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a manual on natural diet, this is it. The brain starts out with the ability to synthesize most carbs the body will need. That ability degrades over time as the body adjusts to being fed it&#39;s carbs from an external source.</p>

<p>Pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs such as &#39;lipitor&#39; are doing a major disservice to humanity by peddling &#39;medications&#39; that are counter productive to what your body needs(fats).</p>

<p>Governments are using food as a weapon against human beings and animals all over the world. Forcing feeding grains to animals is animal abuse since it is not a part of their natural diet. The difference between a forced and natural diet leads to an imbalance in the ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 fatty acids, which then translates to a decline in health for humans since the omega 6&#39;s are in a much higher concentration than they should be.</p>

<p>What are you taking about? The brain does not synthesize jack.</p>

<p>Even if it did, why would we want to synthesize carbs? The only reason to do so would be energy storage, and we synthesize other more practical molecules for that, including lipids. </p>

<p>You seem to think carbs are some sort of essential nutrient, like amino acids or vitamins. Carbs are just a good short-term energy source because they are easier to metabolize than lipids. That&#39;s it. One type of fuel out of many.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s one of the dumbest things I&#39;ve ever heard. First off, everything with genes is genetically modified, just not necessarily by us. But even if there were some fundamental difference between the DNA of wild wheat and GM wheat, so what? Does the DNA of whatever you&#39;re eating meld with your own? Of fucking course not. That&#39;s retarded.</p>

<p>If you want to hold an opinion on these matters, get an education first. You&#39;re talking out of your ass. It&#39;s people like you that give a bad name to anything conspiracy-related.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s rich. I&#39;m the ignorant one, yet you seem to think that DNA is a protein. I really hope you haven&#39;t put as much time into studying this as you imply, because you seem to have gotten nothing out of it. </p>

<p>DNA is absolutely NOT made of amino acids, as any 7th-grader can tell you. That&#39;s proteins you&#39;re thinking of. I would have thought pretty much everybody knew this, but I guess your extensive work in the subject didn&#39;t cover the most basic aspect of it.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s be charitable and assume you meant bases, which are to nucleic acids what aminoacids are to proteins - the basic building blocks. Genetic manipulation changes the order and/or frequency of the building blocks (i.e. the data they encode), not the building blocks themselves. So no matter how potentially screwed up the DNA you&#39;re ingesting, the building blocks are <em>exactly</em> the same. </p>

<p>Think of the 4 bases as Lego blocks in 4 different colors. DNA would then be a stack of these blocks, and the order of the 4 different colors within this stack determines the information encoded in it.</p>

<p>I makes no difference what that information was, because, as you say, our bodies just break it down to its component blocks, which it then adds to the Lego pile from which to builds its own stacks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really not that complicated. But then again, neither is knowing the difference between &#39;its&#39; and &#39;it&#39;s&#39;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like I told my friend&#39;s fat wife - Carbs make you fat (and fat people are worth a lot of money to the health care system). I asked her what she ate for breakfast, she said oatmeal. I told her that oatmeal is what my mom feeds to her horses in the fall to fatten them up.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a group called r/paleo, check it out. The diet is based on what cavemen ate - Meat, eggs, fruits and veggies. No grains.</p>

<p>And any GE foods available are probably harmful, but we don&#39;t really know how harmful because Monsanto blocks all the research, and just to get your hands on the seeds you have to sign a waiver saying you won&#39;t do any type of testing which probably would prove it to be harmful.</p>

<p>And Monsanto owns XE/Blackwater or whatever the fuck they call themselves now. Why do you think that is?</p>
