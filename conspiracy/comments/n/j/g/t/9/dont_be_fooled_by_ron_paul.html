<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5HWR8NdIoM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5HWR8NdIoM</a>
The video description says it&#39;s the &quot;I love you&quot; hand sign. I&#39;d argue otherwise.</p>

Ron Paul reveals his true allegiances once more.</p>

<p>INB4 he&#39;s a rockstar, he&#39;s a Longhorns fan, or he loves us.</p>

<p>Here are some other well known individuals flashing their masonic circlejerk gang signs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_FrVID0ig">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_FrVID0ig</a>
A video of the gang signs in action.</p>

<p>If Ron Paul really was independent, he would not have gained nearly as much ground. It&#39;s the same principal as before. Control the opposition and you control the outcome. Just as both &quot;sides&quot; of wars are funded, both &quot;sides&quot; of a political spectrum are funded. The presence of Ron Paul serves to keep people distracted into thinking that they can vote their way to a solution when that is a laughable notion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I support the truth and what you are spurting out may be your truth but it doesn&#39;t represent the consensus - even among r/conspiracy. i think you need to go back and do some more research and see that RP has been a conspiracy theorist for about 30 years.  Next you will be saying &lt;insert conspiracy theorist here&gt; is controlled opposition. They&#39;re not it&#39;s only your interpretation of the situation that is controlled.</p>

<p>I also suggest that your struggle to cope with this &#39;controlled opposition&#39; is in fact a reflection of something going on in your own life that is personal to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No brain, No gain.
So you wanna settle this hand signaling thing, right?</p>

<p>Lets begin with an assumption:
Hand signals are a way of communicating human messages found through out our culture. examples: gangs, religion, rituals and even your daily casual communication with other human beings (signaling yes/no with just a finger.</p>

<p>Now, we look at ron paul and we see a weird signal in his hands. Something which is not common through the US culture.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5HWR8NdIoM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5HWR8NdIoM</a></p>

<p>And we ask ourselves what is he messaging and to whom?
but oops again... we didn&#39;t use our brains. maybe he just did it innocently, without noticing you can say.</p>

<p>So after we used our brains a bit lets consider our options.
1. He didn&#39;t notice it.
2. He is indeed communication something.</p>

<p>How can we settle for the right option then?
We have to ask the guy ourselves. But before we ask him why did he make a certain shape with his fingers let use our brain again.</p>

<p>What are the possible outcomes:
1.He says he did it innocently.
Then I, as a reasonable person who needs to consider this guy for a president must ask myself a question. If he can&#39;t control his own hands in to making those weird signals(which are definitely uncommon) 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5HWR8NdIoM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5HWR8NdIoM</a>
how can he control a nation?</p>

<ol>
<li>He says he indeed made some sort of signal to someone... and the rabbit hole goes deeper..... muahhahahhahah</li>
</ol>

<p>oh... and something else....
you will never get to ask him this question and get a reasonably response because he probably knows what the hell he is doing with his fingers and you will be called a conspiracy theorist... they ask the questions which they want to ask... not you. Go back to sleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s reasonable to have suspicions; and certainly warranted given the crowds we&#39;re given as selected electables.</p>

<p>The reason RP isn&#39;t running as an Independent has been stated: He would not be given the &quot;voice&quot; were he to do so. In that he would not be eligible to participate in all the debates and he would invariably become marginalized yet again.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I disagree with you, but you have to understand that you will get the same reaction today as you would talking to a black guy on the street prior to Bush v2.0/time traveller/akhenaten/CIA Operative/Clone/Barry Soetoro/Muslim Obama/Socialist (take your pick) got elected in 2008. (Not that ethnicity has anything to do with the subject or the event, simply used the reference to put some context to it.)</p>

<p>As you said, as we&#39;ve heard, as we do: Be the change. Trying to banter to people who don&#39;t see it now, but they will eventually, isn&#39;t being the change and allowing the change to happen because it isn&#39;t upon you to make people see something, or be something.</p>

<p>And, to be quite frank, your sources are kind of weak. Find something substantial.</p>

I&#39;ll tell you this story about myself...back when I was really into conspiracies in 07-08. I followed Ron Paul around and watched his video. Started noticing those things too but, the more I looked into it. The more stupid and paranoid I felt about it. Those hand signs can be interpreted either way. Which is the same conclusion I came too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The is a sign from American Sign Language which, as a gesture, has moved into the mainstream. Seen primarily in the United States and other Americanized countries, the sign originated among deaf schoolchildren using American Sign Language to create a sign from a combination of the signs for the letters I, L and Y (I Love You)</p>

<p>The sign is a very informal way of expressing a number of positive emotions ranging from general esteem to love for the recipient of the sign. </p>

<p>A similar-looking but unrelated variation (thumb toward the palm rather than thumb extended) appears in heavy metal music culture as a &quot;devil&#39;s horns&quot; hand-sign aka (the Corna)</p>

<p>anyway more on horns here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corna">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corna</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either you don&#39;t know your ass from your elbow, or you are acting as a political disinformation agent to attempt to poison Ron Paul&#39;s reputation. Anyone who knows Ron Paul can see very clearly and easily that he speaks the truth, and that he can be trusted all the way to the bank. Literally. He&#39;s going to go after the Federal Reserve. So go peddle your disinformation somewhere else.</p>
