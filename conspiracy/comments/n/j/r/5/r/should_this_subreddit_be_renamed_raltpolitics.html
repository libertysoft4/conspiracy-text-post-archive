    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not so dichotomous, but that&#39;s the basic premise. I think using &quot;unreal&quot; is a bit slanted though...we have shown over and over again that these unreal things have turned out to be fact; CiA drug running, gov operated coups, propaganda campaigns, corporate/gov connections, pharma not to make people healthy, education not teaching the youth to think critically, the sham that is modern banking, media manipulation, etc. All directly affect how we think about and interact with the world.  Why even talk about the intangible elements of the conspiracy mindset? How would it change your life if there was some alien presence on our planet?  What would be the point of spending hours discussing the hollow earth?  So what if reptillians are real, none of this actually matters because we can&#39;t do anything to change it and it doesn&#39;t direct affect our lives.  The items that you can prove to be real are those that we can help change...  Anything else is disinformation, regardless of its truthfullness.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is confusing about this subreddit is when I see something called &quot;conspiracy&quot; I&#39;m looking for paranoid bullshit like reptilians and crazy-ass apopheniac rants about bloodlines and stuff.</p>

<p>However, the current reality is intersecting with conspiracy&#39;s bizarro-world  in ways which should alarm anyone.  Truth and fiction are not so far apart as they once were - hence, you look in here, and you have to ask yourself: am I reading crazy-ass bullshit, or are things really this fucked up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ever heard of a slide? A slide is a keyword that when used, makes people turn off logic and go into emotion. Good examples are 9/11, halocaust, abortion, Catholic church rape, racism, etc. What I find funny about people not even considering what you just mentioned, is that the word reptilian works on them in the same was &quot;9/11 was an inside job&quot; works on most Americans. Say it and all you get it &quot;nope, that&#39;s fucking crazy, not even going to dignify it with critical thinking.&quot; A lot of the people that laugh at Icke are often times the same people that get mad at the masses for not listening to alternative views, like the 9/11 inside job view.

<p>Edit - not to mention that the tribe may think the white man is a ghost or zombie, something of myth or legend, the same way many think of interdimensional beings/aliens. We really are no different than the tribesmen.</p>
