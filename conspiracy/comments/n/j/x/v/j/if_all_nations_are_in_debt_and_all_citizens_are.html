        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If all nations are in debt and all citizens are to forced into lifelong austerity to pay off &quot;their&quot; creditors then the most important question in the world becomes:</p>

<p><strong>Identifying the creditors and why they have precedence over the future lives of whole nations of people?</strong></p>

<p>Think clearly about this for a moment.
&quot;austerity&quot; means your lives will be less free for decades.
Since all nations are &quot;in debt&quot; to extreme then their must at it&#39;s core be a group of private creditors benefiting from this situation.</p>

<p>governments everyday have the moral right as representatives of the people to weigh and balance private citiziens rights against those of a small minority of other citizens. This happens with other individual citizens property rights being sujugated to community interests in processes such as eminent domain everyday.
It is moral and right for the governments to identify the core group of private people hiding behind all the debt shell entities who are supposedly &quot;owed&quot; money by these countries citizens. Those citizens likely never voted for the debts anyway. Collectively the governments should all subjugate all these false debts to the rights of the people in a national worldwiode form of eminent domain. </p>

<p>Austerity for millions is not an acceptable situation to recognize diffuse, ill borrowed, non voted, &quot;debts&quot; often made by politicians serving the very &quot;creditors&quot; rather than the people.</p>

<p>Millions of people should not be forced into a lifelong form of loss of freedom (which is what &quot;Austerity&quot; really means on an individual level for each citizen) as a result of putting false debts unto the backs of their governments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, this type of thing is inevitable.  It&#39;s not like the hypothetical list would be the result of benign political or ideological differences.  These individuals exist at the top of a truly exploitative political/economic power structure that is increasing its grip day by day.  It&#39;s really only a matter of time...  Do you think the historical monarchies of Europe could have ruled in relative anonymity for very long?  </p>

<p>What we have today is completely untenable.  Without clear leadership, there are no social consequences when greed/incompetence run rampant.  Conversely, there is no incentive for success because there is no glory either.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is listing the names of criminals &quot;proposing a hitlist?</p>

<p>Is listing the name sof congress people who vote for a bill &quot;proposing a hitlist?&quot;</p>

<p>no.
ridiculous.</p>

<p>It is allowing people to understand the true nature of  a sitaution and allowing them to decide which philosophical and hence political decision to make about the issuance and payments ofthese &quot;debts&quot;.</p>

<p>Many of these arugments that these nations should pay these endless debts are based on the idea that this money is going somewhere important - to little old ladies invested in bonds or essential intergovernemtnal financial institutions which no one could afford to cutoff.
They aren&#39;t.
Names names of who actually recieves the bulk of the weslth transfers exposes that.</p>

<p>Are you seriously arguing that certain people  who expect to have whole nations of millions of lives restricted just to transfer taxpayers welath to them are somehow more worthy of some sort of weird idea of secrecy you have?</p>

<p>Think they should be able to do it in secret?
How is that logical.</p>

<p>People are in control of their own destiny and level of support from others. People who demand whole nations restrict millions of lives in order to transfer wealth to them should be expected to publicly support their own arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is simply not true but a common misconception pushed by those who don&#39;t want you to knwo how much they actually control.</p>

<p>and dont be fooled by pension fund front names either.
usally huge funds themselves are primarily owned by single family who mix in a comparitive little public money so they can say its everyone.</p>

<p>a perfect example is the huge johnson family fund whcich controls so many corporations through their front fund the Fidelity Funds which is almost all johnson family money.
(the johnson heir runs it and one always will)</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_Investments#Mutual_funds_and_stock_brokerage">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_Investments#Mutual_funds_and_stock_brokerage</a></p>

<p>now someone looking a sotck report might see &quot;fidelity&quot; and think moms and pops everywhere (which they want you to think) but its actually the johnsons and they sit on and control the boards of those companies. They control them.</p>

<p>the fact that their 2.5 trillion in Johnson family wealth is mixed in with 20 million people who each contribute an additional investment dollar does not mean that the wealth is owned by 20 million investors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if these organizations are private then the owners need to be forced disclosed.
that was part of my original point of the post.</p>

<p>this is one of the most important facts of our time. Who owns this &quot;debt&quot; and why should taxpayers be forced to pay them for decades?</p>

<p>we need to know who they are.</p>

<p>just as any creditors if challegend must come forward with documents to prove their right to collect a debt - so should the private owners orf these organizations that want taxpayer moeny for decades in the billions.</p>

<p>the public has a right to know.</p>

<p>Privacy ownership laws should not apply to any organization whuch has such a huge influence over policy. People need to be responsible for the business influence they had and be willing to defedn it our --- they shouldn&#39;t get paid.</p>

<p>I think we could get the names in the same way.</p>

<p>What would be a better analogy then that? Perhaps; barter and labour provides the world&#39;s very poor with the sustenance they need to survive. Since they rarely generate capital to eat it&#39;s the fruits of extra labour that provides them with the means to find room for improved standing. This was the foundation of our very monetary system and it still is a reality for hundreds of millions of people today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is really only one issue that is fucking all of us:  Debt is handed down from one generation to the next through the combination of government debt and taxes.</p>

<p>Today, anyone can be a slave owner (and you can enslave generations).  All you have to do is buy government bonds.  Those bonds are paid back with tax revenue from the government that you bought them from.  If you have enough money, you can buy large swaths of tax revenue from different governments.</p>

<p>There are more elaborate games afoot, but this is a simple one that serves to illustrate the point.  It is disgusting that people can invest in securities that translate to tax revenue on other people.  We all become bondsmen and bondswomen, nice and tidy and done with industrial efficiency.  The benefactors are whoever has the most money.</p>

<p>Yes, we are all slaves.</p>

<p>Government debt should not be allowed to pass from one generation to another.  Tax revenue should not be able to be wrapped into financial instruments and sold to investors.</p>

<p>The whole system makes me want to puke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were ever to suggest something along the lines that being constantly in debt to creditors is something akin to being less free, the average world citizen would think back to the time they lent someone $5 for lunch money and never got repaid for it, and then take the side of the creditors, then get all shirty for you being some kind of libertine socialist or something.</p>

<p>We are where we are not because of a power elite, nor a runaway cabal who runs the world&#39;s government&#39;s and banks.</p>

<p>We are where we are because people fucking love being slaves.  Every conspiracy theory involving any kind of elite is just a little tale we tell ourselves to distract ourselves from the reality:</p>

<p>We are where we are because of what we do, what we believe, what we advocate for, and - perhaps most importantly - what we don&#39;t do.  What we aren&#39;t willing to sacrifice for a better world.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6b70TUbdfs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6b70TUbdfs</a></p>

<p>It is not that the average individual has any issue with a boot stomping on a human face forever.  What most people want, even if they refuse to admit it, is a boot stomping on someone else&#39;s face, taking their shit, and giving it to them.</p>

<p>When that boot stomps on our face, only then does it becomes a problem.</p>

<p>I have talked to enough people long enough and asked enough questions to know that what people really enjoy is talking about freedom or being really conspicuously for it in abstract.  But when it comes time to have the courage to take a stand, people will basically act according to their most crass instincts.  They will say things like: Gotta look out for #1 or &quot;It&#39;s a dog eat dog world&quot; or some other rationalization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>governments everyday have the moral right as representatives of the people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Governments are no such thing and have no rights, just powers.  And even those powers are those supposedly delegated by the majority, in complete defiance of what the minority - or any individual - wants.  Had people not conspired to allow a giant monolithic government to exist -- and make no mistake; that is what people want -- government would not have the capability to fuck us over this much.  What people want with government is to have their cake and eat it too.  They want a really strong national defense without a military industrial complex.  They want lean, efficient government, so long as they keep receiving their benefits.  They want law and order and courts -- so long as everything they do remains legal and unmolested.  People want big, intrusive government which leaves them alone but fucks with everyone else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>weigh and balance private citiziens rights against those of a small minority of other citizens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is exactly the logic used in support of censorship, gun control, and the drug war.  Public welfare, public sensibilities -- whatever -- the idea is that your liberties are entirely subjective and at the whim of whatever the supposed &quot;representatives&quot; of the majority want.  As they wanted the drug war.  As they wanted censorship.  As they want (in the US, at least) endless, pointless foreign war and the military-industrial complex necessary to maintain it.</p>

<p>The fact is that the government, for all of the bitching and moaning to the contrary, is doing exactly what &quot;the people&quot; have authorized it to do repeatedly and will continue to do. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This happens with other individual citizens property rights being sujugated to community interests in processes such as eminent domain everyday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re actually using eminent domain, which is an atrocity, to support a point of view?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is moral and right for the governments to identify the core group of private people hiding behind all the debt shell entities who are supposedly &quot;owed&quot; money by these countries citizens. Those citizens likely never voted for the debts anyway. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never voted for the debts, or the power of government to incur debt, or for government, period.  That doesn&#39;t stop you, apparently, for insisting the government does X, Y, and Z at my expense whether or not  I agree to it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Collectively the governments should all subjugate all these false debts to the rights of the people in a national worldwiode form of eminent domain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is an easy sell when it&#39;s some big faceless debtor, but becomes a whole other story when you realize these things will merely be passed onto citizens via things such as job losses and/or higher prices.</p>

<p>Consider the 401K and how people change when you ask them, before they have any investments in corporations, what government policy should be in relation to them vs. after they have some skin in the game. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Austerity for millions is not an acceptable situation to recognize diffuse, ill borrowed, non voted, &quot;debts&quot; often made by politicians serving the very &quot;creditors&quot; rather than the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Governments by definition never serve &quot;the people&quot; because there is no such thing.  There is only &quot;the majority.&quot;  I have yet to see any political system which cares one goddamned bit about the individual or the minority.  The biggest superstition behind all government is the concept that there is something metaphysically authoritative about majorities.  There isn&#39;t.  Whether it&#39;s the majority or one single trillionaire fucking me, I&#39;m still getting fucked.  Everything that is possible remains possible because the same people bitching right now are the ones who insisted on having a government that could incur debt, could tax me, and then stick me with the bill.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Millions of people should not be forced into a lifelong form of loss of freedom (which is what &quot;Austerity&quot; really means on an individual level for each citizen) as a result of putting false debts unto the backs of their governments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am as pissed off about this as anyone else but make no mistake: most people are getting exactly what they asked for, if not what they necessarily deserve.  These are the consequences of having a nanny state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putting names on people and calling them out does nothing to remove them from power.  Protests don&#39;t do it.  Voting apparently doesn&#39;t do it when everyone claims to hate incumbents -- except their own, which is what polls show.</p>

<p>Letters to the editor don&#39;t actually remove people from power.  Placards, signs, protest marches...not one person has stepped down as a result of these.</p>

<p>The problem is that people think they have power.  That all it takes is some kind of mass consensus to remove people from power.  Not only is that consensus not achievable, but even if it was, so what?  What are people going to do?  Gather in the streets by the million and shout people out of power?</p>

<p>The powerful continue to look down on a disgruntled populace from penthouse windows drinking expensive scotch bought with <em>your tax dollars</em> and laugh at you while taking bets on who the cops are going to beat on next.  That is, if they can even see you way out in your cordoned-off free speech zone.</p>

<p>I would ask people to point to one thing that has changed since all of these street protests started - and it has only gotten worse.  And when I suggest that all of the noisemaking in the streets has done exactly fuck-all, people get really angry and downvote me because they so desperately want to believe that all it takes is CARING REALLY HARD.</p>

<p>Even though it&#39;s the fucking truth and no one can point to anything that has changed, other than mumble something about the Civil Rights movement which was something that happened 50 years ago in a different time and a fundamentally different society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>tax evasion is one answer although in legalise terms I should probably say tax efficiency of something along those lines.  Think about it, if you are a powerful corporation able to hire the best lawyers and operate in multiple jurisdictions you can set up shelf companies and all sorts of shenanigans to funnel money all round the world to avoid paying taxes , also most governments have sold at a discount anything of value and now only have the right to tax as its only asset which presumably is of limited value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately most, if not all governments follow the rules of finance. Which is fine when the economy is growing heathily. That is, invest in projects with the highest return in relation to your capital structure over periods of time acceptable. Traditional finance theory holds that there is nothing wrong with debt, even more, a capital structure of 100% (yes 100%) debt is beneficial so long as there is no tax linked with that debt. Since governments merly pay interest on their debts and not tax, they all went on financial spending sprees based on debt, assuming the economy would not tank. They bought or subsidized anything beneficial in the long run, which is how markets have emerged so quickly over the last 100 or so years. Debt speeds progress when used effectively. America has pioneered much of this thinking.</p>

<p>However we are now in a sticky situation caused by currupt bankers making bets against the market. The market has crashed to a harmful level. So we&#39;re playing the stall for as long as you can game until interest payments can&#39;t be made on the governments debts and ashes, ashes we all fall down.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I do not approve of how the government has accrued debt. But the financial crisis the world faces right now is not entirely government failure. It is curruption within all levels of capitalism and politics. Also, I believe governments should be far more frugal to minimize risk.</p>
