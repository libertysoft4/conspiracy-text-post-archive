    <div class="md"><p>I just came to reddit to find a retreat from the injustice in the world only to find that freedom of speech is apparently a myth on reddit as well as in the US. Let them shut it down then along with the rest of the internet and all hope for the global information age in January with the IP Protect Act.  Even going to reddit I can&#39;t find a ideal world, with freedom of speech.  People don&#39;t go to reddit for censorship. </p>

<p>His video was deleted, and when he tried to repost it,  he was accused of spamming an &quot;unclear video, that people have to go over an hour into, using a sensationalized headline?&quot; even though he clearly warned twice that you needed to fast forward to an hour and eight minutes, TWICE. Not only was he insulted for his attempt to contribute to the fourth estate (and was it not Cicero who said that all those with a voice to speak are members of their government?). </p>

<p>The when he became justifiable angry and said, &quot;They want spam? It&#39;s time we showed them spam. This should be reposted as frequently as possible tomorrow during peak hours,&quot; the comment which he assumed he was banned for, not only was that comment deleted but also his OWS post was?   </p>

<p>Thanks for posting this in conspiracy. It is one. Another conspiracy: after looking into this, I realize <a href="/r/polticalmoderation">/r/polticalmoderation</a> doesn&#39;t acutally moderate political moderation, it&#39;s just a place for you to go complain and the political moderators, so that you can... feel better about the injustice, even though you still seem to have no recourse for justice. It&#39;s like our government de-evolving all over again. It&#39;s like the digital equivalent of losing your faith in the abilities of the people administering your political system. </p>

<p>No deceit is intended, I created that sub-reddit after the <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> moderators started deleting all meta discussion of moderation from the sub-reddit.</p>

<p>It is not affiliated with the moderators of any political sub-reddit in any way, and I see that as a benefit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you do realize who owns Conde Nast (reddits owners)? Why it&#39;s the Newhouse family. shit runs down hill and their at the top. Anything they don&#39;t agree with can be removed from reddit without question. I have seen  so many suspicious removals and such that I&#39;m convinced they often make a phone call, and have something removed. They are a wealthy Zionist family, and top dogs of numerous publications and newspapers since the 1950&#39;s...</p>

<p>They don&#39;t have mod status of course, the just &quot;make a phone call&quot;...</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the same go&#39;s for any of their acquaintances/friends. And they <em>all</em> hate OWS...</p>

<p>You were simply removed by a mod with instructions...</p>

He is the one who campaigned against self posts in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> yet he became mod there. Some one told me that he is underemployed and single, that makes him angry all the time, and he gets pleasure by banning people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems you think you are being banned from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> because of OWS. Might you consider that it has to do instead with Yemen?</p>

<p>The Obama administration is trying to sneak Saleh into the US but is working hard to hide when.</p>

<p>NYT: &quot;Though the administration had been concerned that approval would anger the many Yemenis eager to see Mr. Saleh prosecuted for the killing of protesters by his security forces, some believe that giving him a way out of Yemen, even temporarily, could help smooth the way to elections next year and perhaps end a political crisis that has brought the government of the impoverished nation to the brink of collapse.</p>

<p>“In the end, we felt there was enough good to be gained that it was worth.... managing the criticism that we’d get,.... including any comparisons to past episodes,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the arrangement was still being completed.&quot; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/27/world/middleeast/saleh-yemen-leader-to-be-admitted-into-us-for-medical-care.html?_r=1&amp;amp;pagewanted=all">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/27/world/middleeast/saleh-yemen-leader-to-be-admitted-into-us-for-medical-care.html?_r=1&amp;amp;pagewanted=all</a></p>

<p>AFP: US says no decision yet on Yemen&#39;s President entry <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/us-says-yemens-saleh-only-come-treatment-133638928.html">http://news.yahoo.com/us-says-yemens-saleh-only-come-treatment-133638928.html</a></p>

<p>Your post on Yemen has gotten a much larger response than any other Yemen stories. Looks like you got &quot;managed&quot; as the quote says.</p>
