<p>Next: researching the only actual egyptologist&#39;s name mentioned at the very BOTTOM of the wikipedia page in google: (This just a small part of the info i found by doing a simple search on the Egyptologist&#39;s name (sorry for the poor cut and paste formatting results)</p>

<p>I just learned from 10 minutes of research
actually there have been numerous scientific studies .</p>

<p>Quote from the only report on the newly discovered pyramids by an ACTUAL EGYPTOLOGIST</p>

<p>Dr. Egyptologist Nabil Mohamed Abdel Swelim (THREE Ph.D&#39;s in Cairo, discoverer of EIGHT other pyramids , 50 YEARS in the field)</p>

<p>&quot;DR. SWELIM &quot;BOSNIAN PYRAMID OF THE SUN IS THE WORLD’S LARGEST&quot;   PDF     Print   E-mail
Written by Fena<br/>

The Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun is the largest pyramid ever witnessed; it is an amazing structure of great importance to the entire world,&quot; stated Dr. Pr. Nabil Mohamed Abdel Swelim today at the press conference. Dr. Swelim has three PhD degrees in archaeology and Egyptology, and has also discovered four pyramids in Egypt.</p>

<p>Dr. Swelim praised the Foundation&#39;s hard work and its efforts to find the truth about the ancient architects who built the pyramids in Visoko. He indicated the importance of the underground tunnels and compared them to those in ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>„This is an amazing discovery and it is going to take us a lot of time to figure all this out, meaning how these fascinating structures were built&quot; Dr. Swelim added.</p>

<p>Pr. Dr. Mona Fouad Aly, the Chair of the Restoration Department, Archaeological University- Cairo and her colleague, professor/Dr. Suleiman Hamed El Haweli, an expert on Pharaonic-Period Egypt at Archaeological University, Cairo also made a few comments.</p>

<p>„Everything that we have seen so far tells us that human hands built these structures a long time ago. Of course, a lot more research is needed, including laboratory analyses in order to conclude how these structures were made, and most importantly, we need to know their purpose; why they were built, and who built them. I took a variety of samples from the locations in question which will be analyzed in our labs in Cairo, and the Foundation will be given our results&quot;-Pr. Fouad stated.</p>

<p>Professor/Dr. Hamed also stressed the importance of the archaeological locations in question and added that a lot more work is needed in order to figure out the mystery behind the pyramids.</p>

<p>„ The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina must come together and offer its support in researching the Bosnian pyramids. From now on, Bosnia will be known as the &quot;Country of the Pyramids&quot;- Prof/ Dr. Hamed told the audience.</p>

<p>Professor/ Dr. Aly Abd Alla Barakat from the Egyptian Mineralogy Institute completed the team of experts from Egypt. They will be spending the remaining 10 days in Bosnia visiting the Federal and municipal authorities of B&amp;H and holding presentations focusing on the Egyptian pyramids and comparing their construction to that of the Bosnian pyramids.
 &quot;</p>

<p>In 2007 a report by Dr. Egyptologist Nabil Mohamed Abdel Swelim (THREE Ph.D&#39;s in Cairo, discoverer of EIGHT other pyramids , 50 YEARS in the field)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nabilswelim.com/downloads/vic_10.pdf">http://www.nabilswelim.com/downloads/vic_10.pdf</a></p>

<p>&quot;Concluding this stage I may suggest that:
Conclusion 1. At Visočica we have tolerable scenarios, similar to, the local ones at Mexico, China
and elsewhere. Thus the pyramid hill Visočica is a new introduction to the local scenarios of
pyramid science.
Conclusion 2. Because Visočica has small deviations from the classical format as some of the
Egyptian pyramids do; I believe that Visočica is justified for a pyramid nomination.&quot;</p>

<p>additonally his was sent the following studies by
&quot;SEMIR OSMANAGICH:
Sent me a list of the analyses mentioned below
     Construction Institute, Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, July 2006, dr. Ahmet Imamovic , “Stone
      blocks are artificial construction material”
     Institute for Materials, University of Zenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina, dr. Muhamed Pasic, June
      2006-August 2008, had analyzed 50 samples, “man-made concrete with the hardness of
      74-133 Mpa (modern concrete 10-40 Mpa), clay was used as a binding material”
     Geo-Projekt, Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, April 2008, geologist Dr. Izet Kubat, “samples are
      man-made concrete”
     Institute for Materials and Construction, University of Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, July
      2008, Dr. Azra Kurtovic, “hardness of the sample is 74 Mpa, water absorption 1,1%
      (modern concrete 3%), CaO 39,20%, sample shows the properties of the concrete”
     Institute for Geopolymers, France, March 2008, Dr. Joseph Davidovits, “Electronic
      Microscope analysis confirms cemented concrete – geopolymer cement”.2
     Politecnico di Torino, Department for Chemistry, Italy, December 2009, “Binding material
      for the concrete was produced by clay heating process at high temperatures (caolinit,
      muscovite) and limestone (dolomite i calcite), and that technological process transformed
      them to the adhesive material”.
     Faculty for Natural Sciences, University of Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2005-2007,
      biologist Dr. Sulejman Redzic, “Vegetation on the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun is different
      than on other hills and match warmer Mediterranean climate. Due to inner hollow spaces
      surface of the Pyramid is 5 degrees warmer than in surrounded area”; “Several times
      Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun was unsuccessfully tried to be artificially planted. Roots of the
      plants could not penetrate through cemented concrete like through the natural rocks”.

<blockquote>
<p>Osmanagić does have his supporters, and it&#39;s not just he who identifies the conglomerate as concrete. These pronouncements claimed as scientific discoveries are made by the Board of Directors of Osmanagić&#39;s foundation, who are essentially the same people as the fifty or so who attended his ICBP 2008, the First International Conference on the Bosnian Pyramids. Occasionally the Foundation has named scientists from other countries as participants on their team. Osmanagić once said:</p>

<p><em>Foreigners on our team include experienced archaeologists such as Richard Royce from Australia, Allyson McDavid from U.S., Chris Mundligler from Canada, Martin Aner from Austria.</em></p>

<p>Shall we take them one by one?
From: <a href="http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4140">http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4140</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prominent Bosnian archaeologists entered the scrum early on, denouncing the dig and lobbying to shut it down.</p>

<p>Anthony Harding, president of the Czech Republic-based European Association of Archaeologists, has dismissed Osmanagic&#39;s ideas as &quot;wacky&quot; and &quot;absurd.&quot;</p>

<p>Garrett Fagan, of Pennsylvania State University in University Park, has slammed the project. He says that the dig will destroy bona fide archaeological sites in the area.</p>

<p>He recently told the London Times newspaper: &quot;It&#39;s as if someone were given permission to bulldoze Stonehenge to find secret chambers of lost ancient wisdom underneath.&quot;</p>

<p>Experts shovel some of their scorn on the media, which have been trumpeting Osmanagic&#39;s astounding announcements in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Many news Web sites, including the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, MSNBC, and ABC, ran a credulous Associated Press story dated April 19 that carried the headline, &quot;Experts Find Evidence of Bosnia Pyramid.&quot;</p>

<p>In response, the executive editor of New York-based Archaeology magazine, Mark Rose, blasted Osmanagic as a quack and the press as gullible.</p>

<p>To emphasize his case, Rose quoted from online excerpts of a 2005 book by Osmanagic about the Maya.</p>

<p>Passages from the book suggest the Maya descended from the people of the mythical city of Atlantis, who themselves are aliens who came to Earth from the Pleiades star cluster.

<p>again another person saying pyramids don&#39;t exist because one kook has some crazy theories about them.
Ever googled egyptian pyramid power? does that crap mean the pyramids don&#39;t exist?</p>

<p>you found an academic who is pissed at someone else and who isn&#39;t convincved yet?
and that means what exactly?</p>

<p>should we listen to the guys who said man will never fly or the ones racking up the flight hours?</p>

<p>Pyramids exist all over the world in a wide variety of cultures.  It&#39;s the basic shape for &quot;build something really big.&quot;  Pour some sand onto one spot, and you&#39;ll get the basic shape, with the sides inclined at the optimum angle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lot&#39;s of lies in Archeology. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a BA and not BS. They would have you believe that first Hawaiians landed in 700 AD. Hawaiians can trace their roots to Hawaii Loa landing on the Big Isle through chants to 55 BC. Partly Hawaiians fault though. Hawaiians rarely don&#39;t allow the burial caves to be explored to provide more hard evidence and allowed developers to destroy other sites in the past. Now basically ancestral grounds are kapu. All work stops when a grave is found.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m skeptical of anybody who says they can trace anything so far back.  You should read Fomenko&#39;s History: Fiction or Science for a good overview on why it is difficult or impossible to date things with certainty any farther back than about 1700 &quot;AD.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow you pulled this out of the archives. 5 months ago. I&#39;ll keep you book suggestion in mind. I take Hawaiian ancestral records with some grain of salt as people change things as it passed. However the Hula Kumu&#39;s have always past chants via Kapuna&#39;s reiterating their family lineage for centuries. Hawaiians had to keep historical records that way due to lack of writing resources.</p>

<p>They have genealogical records in the past Hawaiian Kingdom Newspaper archives that was shut down during the overthrow in 1890. It&#39;s accepted among Hawaiians as accurate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the difference of historical views by Europeans as fact on Capt Cook was perceived as a God. Where as Kapuna&#39;s from Kelakekua (Cook  landed) say he was never perceived as a God.</p>

<p>According to our correspondent Richard Hoyle, who is part of this Summer’s excavation team, “the Bosnian pyramids are 30,000 years old, which predates any known human civillisation”.</p>

<p>I&#39;m calling bullshit on them for that reason at all. At best these are large hills which have had various forms of external work on them.</p>

<p>30000 years old? Yeah, right!</p>

<p>“The same forces keeping this discovery under wraps is the same force manipulating everything else in the media,” said Richard. </p>

<p>NO ONE CARES! Why would anyone bother to cover up a pile of rocks in Bosnia for feck&#39;s sake?</p>
