    <div class="md"><p>I get all that. Why has he not even mentioned it though? He&#39;s done six hours of radio as well as his &quot;nightly news&quot; thing w/o even saying the word. Do you think Stratfor being HQ&#39;d in Austin might have something to do with it? I&#39;m sure Alex enjoys being a country millionaire. I&#39;m also sure Fred Burton (Stratfor&#39;s CEO) and Alex aren&#39;t strangers, there aren&#39;t a lot of private golf clubs priced to keep the commoners out in Austin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess, but Anon and co. were tweeting about following the Trap Wire story on Thursday, which would have given more sufficient time to be ready for the story. At least in my opinion, I know there&#39;s only 24 hours in a day, I just figured whatever he would have had scheduled would pale in comparison to that leak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah he has that sensationalist streak for sure.  But I think that it is calculated.  His job more or less is to shake people out of their trance.  Which I believe requires him to over-do it.  The people that are already awake are sick of the screaming and sensationalism, i like Alan Watt a lot better he is easy to listen to.  But Jones is to get people in the door to being awake and some people are just so engrained into their way of thinking they need someone who is freaking out to make them look into things just to see what the hoopla is about.  Honestly that is what got me into it. I heard him and I was like whoa what is this guy on about?  Then i started my journey down the rabbit hole</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is nothing but a Zionist shill. He is the Fox News of the &quot;conspiracy&quot; movement without the credibility (and we all know what precious little of THAT there is at Fox!) He is bought and paid for by the Zionists.</p>

<p>Consider: Alex Jones’ flagship radio station, KLBJ AM, in Austin, Texas, is owned by Emmis Communications, a media conglomerate based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The founder, chairman, president, and CEO of Emmis Communications is the dual Israeli citizen Zionist Jew Jeffrey H. Smulyan. Jones&#39; &quot;handler&quot; is his Jewish wife Kelly Rebecca Nichols. In fact, Alex Jones and his Jewish wife and children all qualify for Israeli citizenship under Israel’s “Law of Return”!</p>

<p>I trust this guy about as much as I trust Bibi Netanyahu. NOTHING that he reports cannot be gleaned from other, more credible sources. Trust me, I know. I was his biggest supporter and listener until I wondered to myself &quot;WHY does he give the Jews/Israelis a free pass in everything from their complicity in 9/11 to the USS Liberty murders?&quot; Then I researched it all...now it makes perfect sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AJ hasn&#39;t mentioned it by name but he has always said that the system was always moving towards an orwellian technocracy to watch over the citizens... so yes i would say that he was on top of it, maybe not mentioning it by the operations name but he always said that the government was always 40 years ahead in technology than what they publicly state</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole thread is asinine.  </p>

<p>He was saying they were recording all calls before it was publicly admitted, he was pointing out they were spying on everyone everywhere in real time constantly almost a decade ago.  He was blowing the whistle that all your new appliances would spy on you years before it was publicly admitted.  This &quot;revelation&quot; by zionist shill wikileaks is fucking SELF EVIDENT to anyone who&#39;s been paying as much attention as the Infowars crew has.</p>

<p>Some of us are so deep in this information that a &quot;revelation&quot; like this is blasé.  Just because &quot;Anonymous&quot; are a bunch of &quot;newfags&quot; when it comes to the Orwellian surveillance state and were blown away by this information, doesn&#39;t mean the rest of us were.</p>

<p>Infowars is a news aggregation site, this story broke late thursday night, they reposted the RT story yesterday.  What the fucking beef?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trapwire is just a commercial security / surveillance product. The fact that some of the employees in the company used to work for the CIA is nothing, it was just a selling point for the company, just like the fitness programs designed by &quot;former Navy SEAL xyz&quot;. </p>

<p>Without going in to it too much (and I&#39;m using a throwaway for obvious reasons), the product isn&#39;t even that good. It&#39;s main selling point is as a &quot;cover your ass&quot; for a checkbox on the insurance forms. </p>

<p>Now, if you want to get into something interesting, look at the companies Abraxas has bought in the past couple of years.  Hint, Infonex Internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AJ is a giant joke. I realized that as soon as his voice goes into &quot;!DRAMA!&quot; mode. i.e. When he&#39;s actually addressing some NWO figure as if they were sitting right next to him in his guttural voice telling them how &quot;we will drag (them) to hell&quot; and such. So, in short: fuck Alex Jones, and his websites. And any admin on his websites. And his sheepish supporters.</p>
