    <div class="md"><p>The mass-suicide was organized by Jim Jones because families in the states were complaining to their senators and representatives about how they had lost contact with their loved ones and were worried. A senator, whose name escapes me right now, flew into Jonestown, was ambushed with gunfire from Jonestown&#39;s &quot;enforcers&quot; while the community was forced to drink the Kool-Aid. The residents were held against their will under a pavilion by armed guards. If you tried to leave you would be shot. However, some members did manage to escape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have an opinion on they whys or deeper hows of Jonestown, but the Senator was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Ryan">Leo Ryan</a>, who sounded like an interesting Representative,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the Watts Riots of 1965, then-Assemblyman Ryan took a job as a substitute school teacher to investigate and document conditions in the area. In 1970, he investigated the conditions of California prisons by being held, under a pseudonym, as an inmate in Folsom Prison, while presiding as chairman of the Assembly committee that oversaw prison reform.</p>

<p>Ryan was also famous for vocal criticism of the lack of Congressional oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and authored the Hughes-Ryan Amendment, passed in 1974. He was also an early critic of L. Ron Hubbard and his Scientology movement and of the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon. On November 3, 1977, Ryan read into the United States Congressional Record a testimony by John Gordon Clark about the health hazards connected with destructive cults. Ryan is the only U.S. Member of Congress killed in the line of duty.</p>

<p>Also correct, looks like the wiki article on Leo Ryan is in need of some correcting too, unfortunately, I am no wiki editor yet.</p>

<p>One-hour mp3 will give you the basics on Jonestown + CIA.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> -- <em>Jim Jones had CIA connections.  There was CIA at Jonestown before &amp; during the massacre.  Congressman Leo Ryan was killed there.  The massacre happened one day after damning testimony against the FBI during the House Select Committee on Assassinations hearings.  Key witness due to testify was sent to Jonestown; died.  MKUltra tactics in use at Jonestown.  Mysterious changing reports in the numbers of dead.</em></p>
