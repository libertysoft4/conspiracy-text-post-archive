Some small pockets of waking up, especially when it hits them personally and stuff like that, but at this point I think US has the most awake people, Europe is lacking, although people here are way more united  on big issues and can sort of go from zero to hero, from 10% to 80% of protests and stuff. </p>

<p>But yeah, so far in the general equation we are loosing, its sort of go 1step forward, two steps back. </p>

<p>But, people will wake up, sooner or later, I&#39;d like it to be sooner, but either way, they will wake up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, we are definitely going downhill. There used to be the prospect of modest social mobility after WW2, but that is gone. US is now one of the countries where you can&#39;t move out of the class that you are in.</p>

<p>they want to keep everyone doped up. They make the money off it, so it will never be legal. If they catch you and you go to prison, they make money off of that. </p>

<p>They are very much into violence as a method of control. The wars and the torture are all a part of that along with the worship of the military.</p>

<p>The EU is back and they are outperforming us. China will be there soon. It will be all downhill from these as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Yes, people are waking up. Hasn&#39;t it always been that way?</p>

<p>But more of us are being put into a deeper slumber than are waking up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like you&#39;re walking down the aisle of a speeding bus in the direction opposite the bus is going. It may seem like your&#39;e avoiding the destination but this is just an illusion.</p>

<p>Our world is very different from 5, 10, 20 years ago. But most of us don&#39;t realize it. We tend to justify our reality when it&#39;s deeply integrated into our personhood, no matter how crazy.</p>

<p>Your only option is to move OUT of such places. Some of you seem to think this is running away. And you&#39;d be right.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same kind of running you should do when confronted by a gigantic monster that wants to consume you. You want to stay and fight? Go ahead.</p>
