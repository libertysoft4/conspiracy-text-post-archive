<p>The piss poor economy, ever rising food prices and living prices, and the ridiculous unemployment rate are pushing people to the breaking point. Our society is decaying really fast and people are just getting pushed over the edge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please keep in mind that there are many, many more shootings and murders happening, which one will see ONLY (this is the most important point) on their local news.</p>

<p>And so, only Chicago and nearby communities will learn of the 30+ shootings per weekend, which happen every weekend, in Chicago.</p>

<p>And so, only Detroit will learn of the numerous crimes and shooting happening in Detroit, and people in Chicago won&#39;t get the crime news from Detroit.</p>

<p>The same for ALL American major cities and regions.</p>

<p>Unless the media want to push a narrative (crazy White guy) or sensationalize because a shooting takes place in a &quot;touristy&quot; place, normal gang, drug and crime murders won&#39;t be on the news; they will be ignored.</p>

<p>May I recommend the A&amp;E show &quot;The First 48&quot; which should open your eyes as to what is really going on in America.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the sun rose Sunday, New York City hit a remarkable milestone, recording just 193 murders in the first six months of the year. In that same span, more than 250 murders were recorded in Chicago—a city just one third as large.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s just 2 cities in America.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than 40 people were shot there on Memorial Day weekend alone, and 10 of them died.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not news, apparently.  Just a snippet on Chicago news, and not even a peep on national or international news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. There was another fatal shooting today in New York that wasn&#39;t mentioned at all, and I think it&#39;s because it was a black kid in a black neighborhood. It was a seemingly random ambush, no suspects or clear motive, which is more disturbing to me than a pretty cut-and-dry revenge shooting that turned into suicide-by-cop</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m confused about which you are trying to tell me. That comment is in regard to the mass murders that are happening. </p>

<p>On the other note, I do have brain and I&#39;m not dumb. I realize that there are dozens of murders everyday that don&#39;t get televised. And they shouldn&#39;t be. There are plenty of crimes that are televised by the MSM that shouldn&#39;t be. Like when a child is missing. Every once in a while there&#39;s a huge multi month long mention if the same kid that went missing by the news. I go to Walmart and there&#39;s pictures of a hundred kids that are missing on the wall. I understand it&#39;s all sensationalism, I was just giving an idea on why these mass murders are happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 2 girls missing from my area right now, there are signs posted everywhere.  Like all over the midwest and as far north as Ontario.  I think they are trying to push for GPS tracking on kids, prominent people in local news have pushed the idea already.  These 2 girls literally disappeared right behind my parents&#39; house.  It was on Anderson Cooper and MSNBC and all of that.  They are still missing.  </p>

<p>I think sometimes though there are occult forces at work doing &quot;public sacrifices&quot; <a href="http://jakenichols.wordpress.com/2012/03/09/public-sacrifices/">I wrote a blog on this topic many months ago</a></p>

<p>Oh, hi!</p>

<p>You are one of those new to r/conspiracy, who thinks that you can write something without checking it if it is true.  Who can say something and know it is true, because, as Stephen Colbert has stated, he knows it &quot;in his gut, don&#39;t need no facts&quot;.</p>

<p>In short, an idiot.</p>

With the current state of the economy, shifting social mores, and increasing use of psychotropic medication, I&#39;m honestly surprised that mass shootings don&#39;t happen MORE often.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on psychotropics before, and they really fuck with your decision-making skills. I have no doubt in my mind that prescription drug use has contributed to the increase in mass shootings over the last two decades. Almost every single mass shooter has been on some sort of antidepressant or other psychotropic. Note how school shootings like Columbine didn&#39;t start happening until doctors started widely pushing antidepressants and other prescription drugs on children (the Columbine killers were on antidepressants).</p>

She was saying that she has seen an increase in ER visits in the past 4 years or so. Mostly people (1) doing crazier things to get f***&#39;ed up and (2) getting drunk and belligerent. She attributed it to the economy and such. Maybe there is something to it....</p>

Thisisnotanagram was proposing a conspiracy where prominent Republicans said stupid things to manufacture a debate.

<p>If you want to propose a larger conspiracy where both Democrats and Republicans are being manipulated to manufacture a debate, go ahead, but that&#39;ll probably raise more questions than it answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe taking our guns away is on the agenda. The ruling elite have to. There&#39;s just too fucking many of us that are armed. It would be so much easier to tighten the screws if we can&#39;t shoot back.</p>

<p>An American insurgency would result in a nasty decades long battle. But, if the guns are taken from us, they could do with us as they please. All they need do is have the corporate fucks write a bill (<em>every</em> bill is written by corporate fucks).</p>

<p>Most of the delusional law-abiding citizens would turn their guns in, no questions asked. It&#39;s the law after all. And I believe in the system! No different than any other right they&#39;ve taken away over the last decade or so.</p>

<p>Of course there would be those that refuse to hand over their guns, but it would be a small percentage. Quite manageable.</p>

<p>Now, to the subject of random shootings. I don&#39;t think these are random at all. The FBI has already proven its propensity for creating &quot;terrorists&quot; out of thin air. Find a patsy, give him a fake bomb, blah, blah.</p>

<p>How did they find this sucker in the first place?</p>

<p>The ruling elite know everything about us. Every-thing. They listen to our phone calls. The read our email. They know what we buy. They know what our interests are. Every-fucking-thing.</p>

<p>There exists massive banks of processors that chew on this data 24/7. An assortment of tasks are performed on the data; sorting, collating, grouping, heuristics, etc. Want to know how many atheists have green eyes, are in their thirties, have two kids, are behind on their car payment, have herpes, and got beat up in the 2nd grade? Done.</p>

<p>All this data can be used to filter out &quot;people of interest&quot;. Say, for instance, a guy that got laid off, can&#39;t find a job, he&#39;s depressed as hell, owns a gun, etc.</p>

<p>Perfect!</p>

<p>Now all he needs is a little push, a bit of influence. There needn&#39;t be any direct communication with this individual as with the aforementioned FBI patsy. All that&#39;s needed is to make his life a just a little more miserable than it was yesterday. Push his buttons, as it were. Eventually he might crack and shoot up a burger joint.</p>

<p>Success! </p>

<p>If not, start fucking with the next &quot;person of interest&quot;. There&#39;s an unlimited supply of these potentially violent folks in the good old US of A. In actuality, there are very few of us that cannot be coaxed into violent behavior given the right environment and circumstances. After all, we worship violence. It riddles our society.</p>

Trying to think what I would feel if one of those injured was my wife or sister in law or even fucking me! I have a blowout kit on me at all times so I am confidant that I could do a quick first aid job on myself, which I have done in the past(I have scars on both shins where 7.62mm grazed my legs).

<p>We&#39;re presently living in a society that is going through a period of significant financial stress. As well, for purposes of money and politics, divisions in our society are being strongly emphasized by our immersive media, so honestly, I&#39;m not really that surprised that there have been outbursts of ugly violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, there was the Batman shooting.  Dozens of witness&#39; swear there was more than one shooter.  He doesn&#39;t run, and doesn&#39;t shoot himself...he just waits for the police.  Then, he tells the cops he&#39;s booby-trapped his apartment?  Why go to all that trouble, then TELL the police about it?</p>

<p>Next, we have the temple shooting.  Again, multiple witness&#39; swear MULTIPLE shooters all dressed in black, but only one person is reported, and he&#39;s a neo nazi, survivalist, gun nut.  </p>

<p>Now, we have one guy who shoots 2 people and injures nine, but they report it like he&#39;s a mass murderer.  He was trying to kill a co-worker, and in the process managed to injure the other nine (most with minor injuries).  Yet the spin is the same and the cry for gun control rages on.</p>

<p>Fast and Furious is responsible for no less than 400 (verified) deaths, and the number could be much higher than that.  Where is the outcry now?  Yes, we lost dozens of people during the theater and temple shootings, but nothing compared to Fast and Furious&#39; numbers.</p>

<p>IF even 2 or 3 people were armed at all these shooting locations, they could have taken down the shooters and save a bunch of lives. </p>

Also some Dem leadership has been using it to push even more gun restrictions in California. Instead of taking away our guns so that gang don&#39;t get them, they need to get rid of the illegals so the gang membership drops. But it&#39;s easier to take away citizen guns.</p>

<p>i think its the media. the media has turned from people giving us information about what is going on in the world to trying to get ratings. and the quality of reporting goes down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. A few weeks ago I looked up Frank Rizzo (former Mayor of Philadelphia) on YouTube, where I saw a report on him. It was excellent reporting. Immediately I noticed a difference in what we see today in the MSM. MSM is a joke. People use it to push their own socio-political views and present it as fact. Half truths and whole lies. It&#39;s a shame. It&#39;s a real damn shame. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We here in America breed stupidity. Everyone is on the latest fad and people are just downright self entitled idiots. Alot of these people let the media dictate how they live their life by telling them what to eat, watch, buy, laugh at, support, etc. The media supports violence and sex, which leads to people owning guns and being sexy? No it leads to women being total whores and people getting shot in the streets, seems like were back in the old west. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gave you an upvote. Violence is a part of the American culture, but it is by no means as big as a lot of people from other countries make it out to be. As an American and having military experience (I&#39;ll leave it at that) I&#39;ve been to countries where violence is way more prevelent in day-to-day life. I think America fails in other respects when it comes to these mass shootings and saying that it&#39;s because Americans value violence is just plain wrong and quite frankly a cop-out, oversimplifying a reoccurring problem. It&#39;s just a scapegoat. Btw, I want to note that Shooting sprees are nothing new, in fact I&#39;ve done some research and seen the earliest occurring in the 1800s. </p>
