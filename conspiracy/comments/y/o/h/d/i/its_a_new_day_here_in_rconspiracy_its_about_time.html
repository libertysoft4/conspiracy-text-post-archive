<p>We need to be posting legitimate examples of conspiracy/corruption/coersion with credible sources and highly insightful discussion around the sources. The bottom line is that the nonsense needs to be exorcised out of here, and this subreddit needs to embrace purifying itself of all contradictions. We need truth, not contradiction. We need to be prepared to accept when we&#39;re wrong, and dig deep in research to prove our points. WE NEED TO HAVE INTEGRITY.</p>

<p>If someone provides well sourced evidence that is logical and presented in a respectful way, then regardless of its conclusions, it should be welcomed as valuable discussion. The kinds of devils advocate questions as well as well sourced critical materials SHOULD BE received in a productive capacity, whereby a thought-provoking discussion can arise. </p>

<p>What is not acceptable is the negatively sarcastic, straw-man/ad hominem ridden arguments that are mere bickering. This subreddit needs to get fucking classy, in a hurry. We need to adopt posting methods similar to r/truereddit. </p>

<p>I genuinely love each and every one of you, and want each of you to show the integrity that I know you have. Lets take the high-ground and source/discuss/ non-violently communicate our way out of this rut. We can do this. Join me.</p>

<p>I admit I am skeptic about many things. While people in this sub complain about shills and trolls, I (and other skeptics) experience the same.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you shouldn&#39;t be downvoted for requesting more sources. I would encourage that any post you do be conducted with upmost respect, fostering sound discussions. Simply saying: &quot;SOURCE?&quot; isn&#39;t going to cut it. </p>

However, ______ may have something which could be further researched.&quot; Everyone in here needs to embrace the roll of teacher. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to paste in a comment from elsewhere in this thread, concerning a potential continuum we could use to rank our level of knowledge on a topic, admitting a certain degree of speculation. This would essentially solve many of the problems associated with what you&#39;re referring to. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I follow the continuum of Imagine -- Think -- Believe -- Know... Perhaps this kind of a continuum could be used to rank speculation. Starting backward, the list of proven conspiracies would be considered KNOWLEDGE, for example. pointing out certain facts about relationships and witnessing certain results can teeter on knowledge and belief, depending on the evidence of criminality/collusion ect (this is where the discussion on this subreddit can thrive).. BELIEF can be almost completely proven, but details may require more research. THINKING is essentially speculative; however, known facts that are loosely, perhaps interdisciplinarily connected can be discussed to sort out where there are contradictions and what topics there are where factual connections can be found. IMAGINARY posts are purely speculative with virtually no empirical evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve lurked in this subreddit for quite some time now, and I can tell you what I&#39;ve seen. </p>

<p>A ways back there&#39;d be posts on wide variety of topics. Where as people may have not agreed with them, there was usually a fairly constructive discussion around whatever topic was brought up. I can&#39;t tell you how much I feel I learned from visiting this subreddit. </p>

<p>Granted much of what was discussed was pure speculation, the point was that we were essentially &quot;thinking aloud&quot;. It could have been totally incorrect, it could have lead somewhere, but the point was that people were talking. </p>

<p>Where as I wish we could have the accuracy of r/science, the fact is outside of a VERY small percentage of topics, we can&#39;t! </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the tone of this subreddit go from one of discussion and a progression of trying to move forward through knowledge and discourse to an almost devolution to petty arguing and name-calling. </p>

<p>You want integrity? Integrity in a field of discussion where information is often almost impossible to come by (again, outside of certain topics)? Integrity starts with taking the time to listen, and then respond logically, not by turning things into flame wars and name calling.</p>

<p>Remember, at one point in history, it was considered FACT that if we were to travel faster than 25mph, you&#39;d die. It took a few &quot;crazy&quot; people to prove that wrong and they did it through learning, keeping an open mind and discussion.</p>

<p>Lets try being less judgmental and more being thoughtful and open to possibilities. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This was a great comment, and I completely remember what you&#39;re talking about. You made a great point here, that much of what we talk about is speculation. There&#39;s this continuum that has come to really help me in thinking about what I can claim to know, and therefore, shape the way I phrase my certainty when speaking about a topic... I&#39;m referring to the continuum of &quot;IMAGINE, THINK, BELIEVE, KNOW&quot;. I have posted the details of this elsewhere in this thread. I believe that if we adopted a similar &quot;continuum of speculation&quot; in this subreddit, that it would be REALLY helpful to shape the conversation. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll share a quote from another comment for an example: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned last night, even posts that are obviously in the realm of imagination should be welcomed here, because perhaps those looking for credibility in this sub can provide the OP with resources that will shed light on what aspects have integrity, and could use further research, or what statements are contradictory or fallacious. In this kind of a situation it is important that violent or hurtful words are never used, as the OP is just someone who is simply trying to make sense of reality. Attempting to have some integrity, We should try to teach them what Knowledge there is on said topic, and encourage a use of language that admits speculation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His comment struck a chord with me too. Something I have been thinking a lot about and you have alluded to elsewhere;  Much can be done by fostering an attitude of common decency and respect here.  I think this is the job of everyone but the mods must lead.</p>

<p>One strategy would for the moderators to start commenting as mods regardless, just to let eveyone you are here.  That way everyone will know who the mods are here and can learn how best to conduct themselves.   This doesn&#39;t mean the mods throwing their weight about , but being a voice of reason and rationality.</p>

<p>It needs to be approached respectfully but there are many examples of discourteous behaviour here particularly if you choose to be skeptical. That being said, it takes two to tango and if people sense agression or an obstinate attitude it can pay dividends to make the extra effort to go the extra mile with politeness.</p>

<p>Something I wondered about was suggesting people take time to visit <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and engage in debate with some of the members there.  If nothing you might learn something of what it is like to have a contrary view in  a subreddit and you never know you may actually learn something.</p>

<p>In terms of how we should generally conduct this sub... we should instill an ethos similar to r/truereddit, so that lively discussion can take place, and those disinformation or trolling can more easily be seen.

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of problems can be solved by simply how we communicate. I honestly think quality discussions still rule the day but you&#39;re correct that instances of non-quality have been more frequent. For example, when disagreeing point to the evidence that causes you to disagree. I think some comments could also be boiled down to &quot;I&#39;m smarter/better than you&quot; as opposed to &quot;I&#39;ve reached a different conclusion and here&#39;s how.&quot; </p>

<p>In general, I&#39;d suggest just not giving a shit about whether a comment is up-voted or down-voted. It really means nothing and really just causes the discussion to degrade rather quickly. Even in this thread you see some attachment to the meaning of this rather pointless system.

<p>This is the core of it, right here. To bring this to a meta-level, generally speaking, our social-culture is always apt to more sophistry, just attempting to discredit your intellectual &quot;opponent&quot;, and &quot;win&quot; &quot;arguments&quot;, when we should be apt to philosophy, getting at the portions of argumentation that posses sound wisdom and expounding on that...</p>

<p>I agree with you!

<p>This is an excellent point. If posts are more thorough than any of these short, antithetical, spiteful comments will become more obviously irrelevant and users can be downvoted and reported. So yeah, we just need to get on here and do some research and writing about whatever topic is posted. We need to be prepared to admit when there is a degree of speculation or uncertainty about a topic, and very importantly, keep our cool!</p>

<p>Thank you for having this discussion with me. I&#39;ll gladly check out your new sub!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I think that in general, if our posts do the following, we will fix the problem (for the most part): </p>

<p>1) attempt to credibly source known evidence that we have</p>

<p>2)foster a general ethos of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">non-violent communication</a></p>

<p>3) true users post highly insightful, well sourced comments (the trolls become more obvious)</p>

<p>4)REPORT users who consistently post negatively sarcastic/hateful words. These users should be banned. We need to start looking at the history of these posters, and anything suspicious needs to be brought to the mods&#39; attention. IMO, any poster who regularly contributes at r/conspiratard needs to be shadowbanned, or overtly banned. </p>

<p>5)if someone is sharing contrarian(to the OP) information that is well sourced, in a respectful way, they shouldn&#39;t called a shill, or even downvoted....We should encourage people to come play devils advocate or post comments that offer a valid critique to the OP, because afterall, we are trying to get at the truth </p>

<p>6)post content that has integrity and admit when there is a degree of speculation in what you are saying... I&#39;ve discussed using some kind of continuum to signify information uncertainty in other comments on this thread</p>

<p>So that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got off the top of my head. I&#39;ll make an edit if I come up with anything else</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey now. I would like to register strong protest at the idea that a regular poster at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> needs must be banned from here. I suffer from an overactive sarcasm gland, and I need to go blow off steam about some of the more ridiculous theories bandied about here <em>someplace</em>. Surely you don&#39;t want it in the comments here! </p>

<p>If behavior in this sub warrants a ban, then ban away. But participation in another subreddit should <em>not</em> be automatic grounds for a ban here; that&#39;s just typecasting, and shouldn&#39;t be tolerated. I subscribe to many subs that are inherenly contradictory, because I like hearing different points of view, and I&#39;m sure others here are similar. We all have a desire to discuss so as to get to truth, no? So it seems outright silly and kneejerk to discuss this as a serious option. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re absolutely right. If we start banning people because of their participation in other subs, we become like the crew of <a href="/r/feminism">/r/feminism</a> and <a href="/r/twoxchromosomes">/r/twoxchromosomes</a> and <a href="/r/shitredditsays">/r/shitredditsays</a>, who will actively ban people from SRS based off of their activity in other, unrelated reddits.</p>

<p>To value open discourse, we can&#39;t preemptively ban anyone. We have to evaluate their attitudes here, and if it is inflammatory, then ban. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I can understand your concern. If you&#39;re exclusively posting a negatively sarcastic comment, you should welcome downvotes if we can make this sub post more credible/provable conspiracy-topics. However, if you are participating on this sub, you should try to provide academically-focused, respectful critiques of others on here. The goal should be to get at the truth of whatever issue it is, and be open to any result, while actively discussing and researching the topic with others here. </p>

<p>We may not need to out-right ban users from conspiratard, but if one is consistantly a hindrance to discussion, what should be done? I would like to take a more &quot;truereddit&quot; approach to this subreddit so that it can become more credible, so how then does true-reddit handle those who consistantly post negatively sarcastic, ad hominem/strawman attacks? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a fair question, and a serious issue. I agree, and while I don&#39;t have any specific suggestions (yet) I think that things are already starting to look up. You and the other mods have put a lot of effort in lately, and I can tell you&#39;re really trying to be fair. Obviously your goal is to foster a higher aim for this sub, and that&#39;s great. </p>

<p>As I said, if anybody is consistently posting in ways that don&#39;t foster that higher level of discussion, they should be banned. No argument there. I personally have tried hard to bite back on my negativity here; I believe my comment history will reflect that. Because of that effort, and my sincere desire to participate in the discussion here, my butt would be pretty sore to be kicked out. Personally. </p>

<p>An open forum for mature discussion <em>should provide room for the airing of dissenting ideas</em>. To do otherwise is to engage in rank hypocrisy. But nowhere in that statement is the right to act like a stupid jerk. Stupid jerks don&#39;t add anything to the store of human knowledge and shouldn&#39;t be allowed to engage in the discussion. </p>

<p>Maybe institute a three-strikes kind of rule? Obvious trolls will easily show themselves by that metric. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for that valuable, insightful comment. I agree with you, sir. This community used to have a great deal of insightful, well sourced debate. Ultimately, anyone here could agree that we are trying to get at whatever truth there is to a matter, and be able to separate facts from speculation, which is often difficult to do in this realm of research. </p>

<p>I really agree with you here.

<p>This is great . I am imagining though that in a lot of cases that not much in the way of evidence will be evident , but if people get into the habit of asking for evidence both for their own beliefs  and others (politely) it should follow they will become better and more logical thinkers.  I suspect there is a lack of critical thinking at the root of many problems here.  No one immune, some people are more skilled than others but if you lack critical thinking skills, you&#39;ll fail to evaluate truth or disinformation for what it is , when you see it.</p>

<p>I think you thinking along the right lines here but there is going to be trouble if everything requires sources and evidence.  Sometimes it&#39;s helpful to speculate as to the reasonableness of a theory it be worthy of discussion if only to point out the inconsistencies and errors in thinking.</p>

We make a conscious decision whether we want to say something helpful and positive, from a mentoring-type position, or say something spiteful and hurtful, derailing the potential conversation.

There is no use arguing in that kind of a situation, it&#39;s best to reprimand, downvote and move on.

    <div class="md"><p>My conversation with moderator sunshine-x should reveal my vision for this subreddit. This is not self-promotion, or sharing a desire to moderate, I just genuinely care about this sub, and want it to thrive... Here you go:</p>

<p><strong>[–]sunshine-x:</strong></p>

<pre><code>We need to be posting legitimate examples of conspiracy/corruption/coersion with credible sources and highly insightful discussion around the sources. The bottom line is that the nonsense needs to be exorcised out of here, and this subreddit needs to embrace purifying itself of all contradictions. We need truth, not contradiction. We need to be prepared to accept when we&#39;re wrong, and dig deep in research to prove our points. WE NEED TO HAVE INTEGRITY.
</code></pre>

<p>How do you propose as a mod team we encourage this, given the fact that we cannot alter voting, we believe coordinated groups are targeting our sub, and we are strongly anti-censorship?</p>

<p><strong>[–]supercede:</strong></p>

<p>This is a great question, and I certainly appreciate you asking it. My apologies for a delayed response, I made that post and then went to bed.</p>

<p>So, where to begin.. My general concept is that the true users begin posting in a more serious, academic manner. I sincerely believe that our trolling issue will be resolved if we create a new general ethos here, whereby everyone attempts to respectfully post their critiques in a sourced way, using &quot;non-violent communication&quot; as the initial approach to speaking with someone.</p>

<p>I believe that if one posts a link containing a theory that lacks verisimilitude, or clearly has little sources to back up any claims, the poster should post their degree of certainty to the information. For instance they could say: &quot;I understand there are some speculative aspects of this article&quot;. Our problems arise when we post links and claim them as being &quot;the truth&quot; or &quot;knowledge&quot;...</p>

<p>I follow the continuum of Imagine -- Think -- Believe -- Know... Perhaps this kind of a continuum could be used to rank speculation. Starting backward, the list of proven conspiracies would be considered KNOWLEDGE, for example. pointing out certain facts about relationships and witnessing certain results can teeter on knowledge and belief, depending on the evidence of criminality/collusion ect (this is where the discussion on this subreddit can thrive).. BELIEF can be almost completely proven, but details may require more research. THINKING is essentially speculative; however, known facts that are loosely, perhaps interdisciplinarily connected can be discussed to sort out where there are contradictions and what topics there are where factual connections can be found. IMAGINARY posts are purely speculative with virtually no empirical evidence.</p>

<p>As I mentioned last night, even posts that are obviously in the realm of imagination should be welcomed here, because perhaps those looking for credibility in this sub can provide the OP with resources that will shed light on what aspects have integrity, and could use further research, or what statements are contradictory or fallacious. In this kind of a situation it is important that violent or hurtful words are never used, as the OP is just someone who is simply trying to make sense of reality. Attempting to have some integrity, We should try to teach them what Knowledge there is on said topic, and encourage a use of language that admits speculation.</p>

<p>Back to my original point, we should instill an ethos similar to r/truereddit, so that lively discussion can take place, and those disinformation or trolling can more easily be seen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A subreddit for really great, insightful articles, reddiquette, reading before voting and the hope to generate intelligent discussion on the topics of these articles... To maintain the focus on great articles, Please (follow especially this part of the reddiquette and) do: Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something. But only if you really think it might help the poster improve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>[–]sunshine-x:</strong></p>

<p>I really like your vision, but am unsure how it can be achieved given the mechanics of reddit, without some firm moderation that may verge on censorship, until the community norms reflect this vision and voting takes care of managing the content. What actions would you take achieve this?</p>

<p><strong>[–]supercede:</strong></p>

<p>In general, we need to change our sidebar and our posting rules.</p>

<p>This is not going to cut it any longer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This subreddit is for the REDACTED and the discussion of REDACTED that may or may not have REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED government agents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to be specific that posts here need to foster sound sourcing, and respectful argumentation. We need a subreddit description similar to that of true-reddit, that acts as our statement of purpose. I&#39;m speaking here about a rebranding of this subreddit.</p>

<p>In terms of dealing with highly antagonistic posters, or trolls, I think any poster who consistently posts negatively sarcastic, grossly unhelpful, or spiteful adhominem/strawman-arguments, should be reported to the mods by the community and downvoted accordingly. The &quot;punishment&quot; is between the mods and that poster. If it escalates to a point, than that user should be shadow-banned IMO. I&#39;m not sure how many users actually get banned here, but if we rebrand this subreddit and encourage non-violent communication, the &quot;trolls&quot; will become very apparent, and hopefully the community itself will &quot;smite them out&quot;.</p>

<p>I also believe we should encourage users to link their posts to some kind of degree of factual certainty. The Imagine-Think-Believe-Know continuum could be a basis for this (potentially quantitative) ranking... It would really serve to self-regulate the seriousness, or academic level of a post itself...</p>

<p>Really? I thought the only proof found of him playing video games showed he played a lot of guitar hero... He certainly didn&#39;t Danzig these people to death.</p>

<p>I get defensive when people claim video games play a roll in this kind of thing. It always comes off as the board game generation being afraid of the latest form of entertainment.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know you or what caused you to add that little piece. But, there was murder before video games, shootings before movies, and I&#39;ll bet they blamed Shakespeare&#39;s plays for violence back in the day.</p>

<p>My point is, before violent entertainment, I&#39;m sure future killers would go out into the fields and kick their goats around.

He claims that the interior was gone and therefore the outershell had no support and fell straight down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watching the second video... it says it burned and collapsed in 7 hours, much less than it approximately took the twin towers. Also, by watching the video you can see that only the top half falls after being completely engulfed in flames from the bottom up. With the twin towers and building 7, this was not the case. Fires started from the top. Also I think this building from the Netherlands was not as strongly reinforced as the WTC buildings, as it is much smaller and thinner. This is the same thing as the burning of the bridge in the original video you posted. Yes, it is true that fire can weaken steel to the point of collapse, but this is only when pretty much the entire part that falls is heated from the bottom up for many many hours, and the building, or bridge, itself is not very strong or heavily reinforced.</p>

<p>There a several examples of buildings/steel structures collapsing due to fire even as fast as 19 minutes. </p>

<p>While it is true the WTC buildings collapsed quicker than 7 hours, remember that they were hit by an airplane flying 500mph+ and 98,500 liters of jet fuel exploded. The fires also did not start at the top.. It started further up the building, yes. But the steel beams that was weakened by the impact and fire, still had to support 180,000,000 pounds. The WTC was also only partially reinforced with concrete since a 110 story building would be to heavy otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw the video again and did some more research. Turns out that the entire structure did not collapse, which was very conviniently left out of the video and the explanation. Only the top half falls, which makes it a completely different scenario than the WTC 7 fire. As far as the part on other steel structures, I don&#39;t doubt that enough fire can weaken steel to the point of collapse. The 19 minute bridge was being directly burned and is by nature (a bridge) much weaker in design than a building. The problem with the WTC attacks is the complete pulverization of the metal, molten steel, and no resistance from the bottom, causing the towers to fall at near free-fall speed.</p>

<p>this is why we use demolition companies, and don&#39;t simply let steel buildings burn to the ground.  it would be much cheaper to demolish buildings with uneven fires and a little damage, especially as it leaves a neat little pile to scoop and dump /s</p>

<p>Edit addition: If this is all it takes to &quot;convince&quot; you that WTC7 was not CD perhaps you aren&#39;t in the right place. Or maybe you aren&#39;t a structural engineer... ; &#39;)
It matters very little how long the fires (small and VERY &quot;controlled&quot; as far as not spreading rapidly) were up. Was there pure oxygen in that building? If not, then those fires could not--ever--reach the temperature to even begin to make the MASSIVE steel main columns weaken. Sure, the thin floor pans may have sagged...but if this is the case there should have been those aforementioned HUGE steel columns poking up into the sky. The only way to literally <em>pulverize</em> a steel/concrete building into talcum-like dust is by CD. It also accounts for the tremendous amount of thermite residue found scattered all across Manhattan/Jersey.  </p>

<p>So far, only one scientist has made this claim, and it has been picked up and repeated as fact by countless others.  The scientist who made the claim of thermite residue never published his findings in any peer-reviewed journal or paper.</p>

It is part of the depopulation agenda possibly?  i don&#39;t have a problem with gays, but there does seem to be more of a push for gay &quot;awareness&quot;, the city I live in just had its first &quot;pridefest&quot; where all the gays took over downtown for a day it was loud and woke me up.  </p>

<p>Then you would hopefully understand that being gay is not a choice, it is who you are. The concept of promoting homosexuality is absurd. I&#39;m straight and all the propaganda in the world isn&#39;t going to convince me to go gay. What they are trying to do is provide positive reinforcement to those who are struggling to come out and accept who they are. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have several gay friends and they have even noticed the big push. I have a gay uncle I was raise around gays, I am not a bigot.</p>

<p>So what? I had two moms and what I see being touted as the &quot;gay agenda&quot; or &quot;promoting homosexuality&quot; is akin to an effort to promote human rights and telling people that they are not perverts for loving someone of the same sex. Raising self-esteem and promoting equality is something I can get behind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To what purpose? Do you really think that there is a secret agenda to make all future generations test-tube baby worker slaves? How would promoting homosexuality help accomplish this? Homosexuals can reproduce through surrogacy and artificial insemination. </p>

<p>You are doing a very good job at proving my theory that conspiracy theorists are people with strong biases who have difficulty seeing beyond those biases and thinking critically about a subject.

<p>You quite clearly have very strong right wing views and that is fine but it is probably clouding your judgement and leading you to think you are smarter than you really are.

Do you know what those words actually mean or have you decided in your infinite wisdom that they mean something else? Maybe they are secret code words for enslaving the human race? Gimmie a fucking break. Looking at your post history you claim that in the last few days you have been under attack.

The Agenda 21 document is the &quot;guideline&quot; that the NGOs feed from and quote directly.  Google &quot;(your city&#39;s name) Sustainability&quot;, I guarantee there is a sustainability plan and it will have no apparent connection to Agenda 21, but I bet there is a larger NGO overseeing it, those NGOs have representatives that attend the Agenda 21 meetings and get orders.  You are completely blind to this because you are set in your ways.  I am not right-wing at all, I just see things for how they really are.  Get your head out of your ass and stop acting all high and mighty about something you have obviously little to no knowledge about.  </p>

<p>edit: you gotta ask yourself why would they even be talking about this subject?  Because they want people to not reproduce.  It is a population reduction organization.  It has been from the start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure that I would use the word &quot;promoting&quot; in this context, so I&#39;m confused by your choice to use it. The first link is an information page for people who are interested in coming out; what better place to put something like that than on a website for a reproductive health care provider? It&#39;s the same thing as WebMD. As for the second link, I don&#39;t read anything in that memo that comes across as &quot;promoting&quot; anything, except the accessibility of reproductive health care to all members of the community, not just women. </p>

<p>Can you clarify to me why these links are doing what you claim they are doing? I don&#39;t see it. </p>

<p>eta: in response to your edit above. They are talking about it because it&#39;s under the conceptual umbrella of &quot;reproductive and sexual health&quot;, and it&#39;s their job and stated mission to do so. Golly. I appreciate your passion, but I just don&#39;t understand the fear surrounding PP. I confess the idea of them being a population reduction scheme is a new one on me, and I&#39;m going to have to think about it awhile and come to my own conclusion. </p>

<p>I would like to go on record as saying, however, that as a lady (yes, I am; no I will not post pictures of my tits), PP has improved my life considerably by providing me with the means to <em>avoid reproduction</em>. Not all of us want families, you know. Should that life be forced upon a woman regardless of her choice? I think not. Perhaps we disagree here, and if so the conversation has come to a reasonable endpoint because we are hardcore derailing this thread right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think so, but I also think that your reading of the source material is reactionary and slightly inaccurate. Just my opinion, but I really don&#39;t see where PP is suggesting that all teens who have ever had a slightly homoerotic thought become gay like now.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not said directly, it is implied.  They shouldn&#39;t be talking to kids about sexuality at all anyway.  Think about if I went up to some kid and started talking about sexual topics, i would get thrown in jail, yet Planned Parenthood, since they are government funded, they can tell kids all about sexual things.  Just like that link up there, requiring teens to go to gay pride event.  Why?  What is the purpose other than to &quot;encourage homosexuality&quot;?</p>

<p>I am not a homophobe by any means you need to understand that, it is just that they are implementing the Brave New World social structure by breaking up the concept of a family and making it so the state will be who raises the kids.  That is DEFINITELY happening without a doubt.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what your family is for.  It should not be some company&#39;s job to teach you about sexuality.  Especially Planned Parenthood, which was started as a eugenics organization to kill black and &quot;undesirable&quot; babies.  Don&#39;t be so ignorant.  These are &quot;new&quot; policies to teach kids about sex, it has never been the job of publicly funded organizations to push any kind of sexual agenda, now it is happening &quot;coincidentally&quot;, it is a planned agenda to reduce the population.  It is all a part of UN depopulation plans, you NEED to understand this.  Make a self post and ask the people on this subreddit all about the depopulation plans and the Planned Parenthood agenda, you may get enlightened.  Or you may be too programmed to reach.  You need to be thinking on a deeper level to understand this.  Taking things at surface value is something that ignorant sheep do.  Use critical thinking skills, if you posses them.</p>

<p><em>According to you.</em> However, if a teenager is looking for information there should be resources for him or her available. There is not always good, fact-based evidence available at home. Parents may know little or be uncomfortable teaching their children. A person should not be limited by the circumstances of their birth in what they know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that we have been infiltrated. I believe that we should take the moral high-ground here and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">non-violently communicate</a> with those posts that do offer genuine, sourced arguments. We should be able to back up any claims we make. If this is a movement to get at the truth, than we should be willing to admit when we are uncertain about something.  </p>

<p>With that said, and considering the commitment of non-censorship, I think we should go on a <strong>campaign of reporting</strong> those users who ALWAYS post the short, negatively sarcastic comments, simply to get a rise out of us. I believe that certain users from r/conspiratard should be banned. period. They do not know how to cultivate a useful conversation, or even criticism that is not spiteful.
As you said, we are probably outnumbered, so I don&#39;t know if downvoting will make a difference, but that is an obvious step. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t see trolls trolling <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> or <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a>, or any other subreddit that provides a network of peer reviewed sources. </p>

<p>I imagine most of the trolls are trolling people who link to things like colloidal silver, <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2012/RA/C2RA20684F">which kill human and bacteria cell alike by the way</a> or other

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed unless it touches subjects of reptilians, ufo takeover or aliens, then I won&#39;t respect it due to the nature cointelpro and black propaganda. Touching them and picking up the tools of the disinformants to play on might bring you some cash if you spin it, but it will never lead you toward a meaningful solution close to truth. </p>

<p>The only time I will listen to people talking about reptilians or contact with aliens and other lifeforms / entities is when I listen to a real Shaman talk about his journeys or any psychonaut discuss tripreports.

<p>One of the most important aspects of participating in this sub is keeping your cool. It&#39;s really important to not say spiteful things. I&#39;m trying to espouse &quot;non-violent communication&quot; in here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what your family is for.  It should not be some company&#39;s job to teach you about sexuality.  Especially Planned Parenthood, which was started as a eugenics organization to kill black and &quot;undesirable&quot; babies.  Don&#39;t be so ignorant.  These are &quot;new&quot; policies to teach kids about sex, it has never been the job of publicly funded organizations to push any kind of sexual agenda, now it is happening &quot;coincidentally&quot;, it is a planned agenda to reduce the population.  It is all a part of UN depopulation plans, you NEED to understand this.  Make a self post and ask the people on this subreddit all about the depopulation plans and the Planned Parenthood agenda, you may get enlightened.  Or you may be too programmed to reach.  You need to be thinking on a deeper level to understand this.  Taking things at surface value is something that ignorant sheep do.  Use critical thinking skills, if you posses them.</p>
