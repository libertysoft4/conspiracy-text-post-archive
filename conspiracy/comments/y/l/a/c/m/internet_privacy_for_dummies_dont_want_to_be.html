        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Lesson one: Web browsers</p>

<p>I recommend first of all that no one should use internet explorer. Ever. I&#39;m skeptical of other closed source browsers as well, such as safari and Opera. Safari has had it&#39;s fair share of exploits published. Firefox is the all around best choice. </p>

<p>Lesson 2: Browser extensions.</p>

<p>There are ways to add on to your web browser called extensions. These can range from simple toolbars to complex security services. They can be good or bad, depending on who uses them and how they are used. Your antivirus may want to install a toolbar to help protect you, and a piece of malware may want to install toolbars for entirely different reasons. Know your add ons well. Here are some of the best BHOs (browser helper objects) for firefox:</p>

<p>Ghostery, NoScript and adblock make for a powerful anti-tracking base to start with. Let&#39;s go a little farther, shall we?</p>

<p>Lesson 3: Host File and blocking traffic completely</p>

<p>The Hosts file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. This file is loaded into memory (cache) at startup, then the OS checks the Hosts file before it queries any DNS servers, which enables it to override addresses in the DNS. This prevents access to the listed sites by redirecting any connection attempts back to the local (your) machine. Another feature of the HOSTS file is its ability to block other applications from connecting to the Internet, providing the entry exists.
You can use a HOSTS file to block ads, banners, 3rd party Cookies, 3rd party page counters, web bugs, and even most hijackers. This is accomplished by blocking the connection(s) that supplies these little gems.
Example - the following entry 127.0.0.1 ad.doubleclick.net blocks all files supplied by that DoubleClick Server to the web page you are viewing. This also prevents the server from tracking your movements. Why? ... because in certain cases &quot;Ad Servers&quot; like Doubleclick (and many others) will try silently to open a separate connection on the webpage you are viewing, record your movements then yes ... follow you to additional sites you may visit.
In many cases using a well designed HOSTS file can speed the loading of web pages by not having to wait for these ads, annoying banners, hit counters, etc. to load. This also helps to protect your Privacy and Security by blocking sites that may track your viewing habits, also known as  &quot;click-thru tracking&quot; or Data Miners. Simply using a HOSTS file is not a cure-all against all the dangers on the Internet, but it does provide another very effective &quot;Layer of Protection&quot;.</p>

<p>Lesson 4: Proxy servers</p>

<p>In computer networks, a proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource available from a different server. The proxy server evaluates the request as a way to simplify and control their complexity. This is where real anonymity begins. All internet traffic gets funneled through a 3rd party and it appears that all browsing is done from a different physical location. The easiest and most widely known proxy program is the TOR network.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/">https://www.torproject.org/</a></p>

<p>This will slow down your internet experience, so don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you. But if privacy is more important than speed, you can always just enable it when needed, and disable when you need speed. </p>

<p>These tips together will help you remain a bit more private on the internet. But nothing is ever fool-proof. So don&#39;t blame me if you follow this guide and get in trouble for doing something stupid. This is just for people who don&#39;t like being tracked by ad servers, not really for complete anonymity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Addressing the image:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1 - The RLZ identifier contains only non-identifying stuff anyway. Can be disabled. If you&#39;re paranoid, just download SRWare Iron or Chromium. </p></li>
<li><p>3 - The clientID can be disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>4 - So?</p></li>
<li><p>5 - You can disable that.</p></li>
<li><p>6 - You can remove the software updater. </p></li>
<li><p>7 - You can disable that.</p></li>
<li><p>8 - Non-identifying. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>And the second picture is the same; Google paranoia. Most of the objections listed are optional and can be disabled anyway. The &quot;connects to websites in the background before you are finished typing them&quot; is a feature of <strong>Google search</strong> - the solution? <strong>Don&#39;t use Google search</strong> if you don&#39;t want to experience its features.</p>

<p>Chrome sends the name of downloaded files sure, but I want a citation for the &quot;stores your IP&quot; part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using 127.0.0.1 in the hosts file (local loopback) has the downside that the browser tries to establish a connection every time, and might actually find something if you&#39;re running a webserver or some other software operating on port 80 (e.g. TeamViewer). Use 0.0.0.0, it&#39;s invalid and the browser won&#39;t attempt to do anything once the domain is resolved. It&#39;s probably just a minor difference, though.</p>

<p>More importantly, regarding TOR and proxies in general: Don&#39;t be stupid when using proxies. Sure, the website you&#39;re connecting to won&#39;t know your real IP address, but they&#39;ll still get everything else, including tracking cookies. Be sure to disable cookies and plugins (Flash, Java, ...) while doing this, or you may compromise any anonymity you gain. The TOR browser bundle will do this for you. Some general purpose proxies will also add HTTP headers identifying your real IP address.</p>

<p>Also very important: <strong>Do not transmit any private information through proxies unencrypted.</strong> The proxy server knows <em>you</em>, and it knows what you transmit and receive (for TOR, the nodes will only know one of those things). When you visit websites without HTTPS, or use other unencrypted services (e.g. standard SMTP/e-mail), the exit node can gather your login credentials and the messages you send. You might actually increase your risk this way. Finding the person behind an IP address requires legal powers, logging into your e-mail account and finding a receipt with your name on it doesn&#39;t. If you don&#39;t trust your ISP and upstream internet providers, do not trust some anonymous guy who sets up a proxy/exit node.</p>

<p>For best results, make the browser ASK you every time it wants to load a cookie tracker - but it can get annoying, clicking 8-20 times per web page...</p>

<p>One more thing: there are many cookies that you will ONLY be able to opt out of (very difficult to get rid of them, as they load every time you log onto the net - apologies, I forgot a specific one I just took out yesterday).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I run a Mac, and will never use a Google product again.</p>

<p>Google has proven repeatedly that they have no respect for users privacy. In fact, they just got fined for hacking Safari around the privacy setting, to allow them to track Safari users.</p>

<p>When you install a google product, they take it upon themselves to install their &quot;keystone agent&quot; that launches on startup and runs ALL THE TIME in the background wether you are using a google product or not. If you install a google product, and then sniff your network traffic you will see this agent constantly communication with Google. Then, even if you uninstall the original google product, the keystone agent is left behind - constantly sending data to google. You have to go online and search for instructions on how to remove it.</p>

<p>This is completely unacceptable. Furthermore, instead of installing it by convention, where the user can see it in their startup items list, they hide it and install it as part of the system startup - so it runs for ALL users. Again, completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>It does basically the same thing on linux - havent used windows in years so dont know if it does there too, but probably.</p>

<p>When a for-profit company gives you something for free.. google chrome, google earth, google docs, gmail etc etc etc... It aint free at all, because YOU&#39;RE the product, and they&#39;re selling YOU down the line to someone else.</p>

<p>Stay the fuck away from Google anything if you value your privacy. Go open-source non-profit. Firefox etc..</p>

<p>If you like the Chrome browser, try Chromium instead havent tried it, but I&#39;ve heard good things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit.  MACs do not leave the lan.  Neither do wifi SSIDs.  Why?  because they are completely useless on the internet at large.</p>

<p>Now, if you have a virus/torjan/malicious plugin that is running on your computer, it can report the MAC back to some server.  But then you&#39;re fucked anyway.</p>

<p>And now that I think about, if you&#39;re using ipv6, some addressing schemes by default put the MAC in the lower 48 bits.  But that is easily changed by the user, and ipv6 is still very uncommon.  If you don&#39;t know with ipv6 is, you&#39;re not using it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some more tips:</p>

<p>1) Virtual machines are your friends.  So is linux.</p>

<p>Setup a generic virtual machine and surf from there.  This provides total isolation from the host filesystem and any identifying information contained therein.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re really paranoid, then use Linux, as Windows assigns a unique ID to every installation (part of the anti-piracy / Genuine Advantage stuff).  Not sure if Macs have the same issue.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to use TOR, use it in a virtual machine stored on a truecrypt volume.</p>

<p>2) advanced firefox settings:</p>

<p>Many people don&#39;t realize that Firefox by default will send the URL of a &quot;suspicious&quot; site to google for checking.  Sure it&#39;s hashed to hell and back for your protection, but it&#39;s still a potential information leak.  The service is called &quot;Google safebrowsing&quot; and here&#39;s how to disable it:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#39;visit&#39; the url about:config</li>
<li>in the filter, type in &quot;safe&quot;</li>
<li>doubleclick the following lines to change their value to false:

<ul>
<li>browser.safebrowsing.enabled</li>
<li>browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#39;re using things like noscript and adblock plus, then GoogleSafeBrowsing is of limited value.</p>

<p>Another service that can leak is the Online Certificate Status Protocol.  This service checks the ssl certificate of each secure site you visit to see if it has been revoked.  Now I don&#39;t recommend disabling this in general;  only if you are worried about someone sniffing your traffic in transit and are EXTREMELY paranoid.  Turning this off means your browser won&#39;t know if a ssl security certificate has been revoked (usually done when a site is compromised).  But it does leak information to a centralized authority, so I&#39;ll include it there</p>

<ul>
<li>Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Encryption-&gt;Validation</li>
<li>uncheck the &quot;Use Online Certificate Status Protocol ...&quot; line</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, only do this if the risk of being slightly tracked by central authorities significantly outweighs the risk of visiting a compromised site.  In other words, don&#39;t do this.</p>

<p>3) firefox proxy settings</p>

<p>If you are using a type of proxy called &quot;socks&quot;, then you must enable the following setting.  Otherwise, DNS queries do not go through the proxy but instead through your ISP, giving your ISP a list of all the sites you visit.</p>

<ul>
<li>&#39;visit&#39; the url about:config</li>
<li>in the filter, type in &quot;socks&quot;</li>
<li>doubleclick &quot;network.proxy.socks_remote_dns&quot; to set to true</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this setting only works for socks5 (socks version 5) proxy.  </p>

<p>4) other important firefox plugins:</p>

<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foundstone-html5-local-storage">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foundstone-html5-local-storage</a></p>

<p>This gives you visibility into the new Local Storage component that allows website to store data in your browser.  The BetterPrivacy plugin will erase this automatically, this plugin jsut lets you see what&#39;s there.</p>

<p>Smart Referer:
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/smart-referer">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/smart-referer</a></p>

<p>When you visit a webpage, the browser will in some cases send the server the url of the page you&#39;re coming from.  For example, if you click one of the links in this comment, Mozilla&#39;s web server will receive the url to this reddit post.  This plugin restricts that so that only the same server (technically same domain) will receive a referer. </p>

<p>This stops one of the really sneaky ways google tracks you.  Many site (including reddit) make use of googleapis.com to serve some common javascript libraries, saving bandwidth.  Google doesn&#39;t offer this for free out of the goodness of their heart, they do it for the referer info they get which helps with usage stats and user tracking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks like those are from Firefox&#39;s syncing functions, which I don&#39;t use.  Set them to false too, as they are most likely copies of the settings I already mentioned.  But keep in mind that if you are using sync, that this will propagate to other copies of firefox.  Make sure you have noscript/adblock/better privacy/etc. running everywhere.</p>
