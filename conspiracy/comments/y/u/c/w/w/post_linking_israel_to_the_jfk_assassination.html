<p>The first image is how the post appears while I am logged onto my account; the second is how it appears to everyone else, ie: deleted.</p>

<p>Peculiar timing, to say the least.</p>

<p>Edit: It happened again

<p>Do links to books on Amazon auto-delete?  If so, that would explain it.</p>

<p><del>Edit2: The Amazon link does not appear to be the culprit, I&#39;ve posted a link to a cookbook in the comments, and it remains.</del></p>

<p>Edit3:  Thanks for the response from a mod, and thanks to everyone for clearing this up.  It appears that one of the links was caught in a spam filter.  Mystery solved, it would appear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>amazon links are detected by the spam filter in comments.</p>

<p>There once was a moderator here named ContheorySpiracist who was very diligent and thorough in his modqueue responsibilities and he would always inform people why their comments were caught in the spam filter.</p>

<p>Your comment, above, will eventually get detected by the filter (the &quot;spam in comments&quot; filter does not happen realtime like the submissions filter; it runs a few hours behind). </p>

<p>Mechanical__Squirrel either has no clue what they are talking about, or is deliberately spewing lies to rouse the torches and pitchforks against the moderators.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that pretty much <em>every</em> amazon link goes to someone selling something. &lt;-- that is spam.</p>

<p>There are other urls which get caught in this same (slower, retroactive) process - mainly URL shortener links (bit.ly, tinyurl.com, etc.).</p>

<p>Well of course, but that&#39;s spam, and reddit has pretty strict anti-spam policies, many of which are automated.  It&#39;s like when Yahoo blocked all references to OWS emails linking to a certain site, it wasn&#39;t because they were trying to suppress OWS emails, it was because the sender wasn&#39;t following the double opt-in method for email marketing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys... do you really think that the mods are working with TPTB? Like I feel that it is so far-fetched for a government agent (or whoever it would be) to contact a redditor and some how convince him (especially a redditor on the CONSPIRACY section) to edit and censor this subreddit. </p>

<p>What I can believe though, is that there are backdoors into reddit&#39;s server that are being accessed by government officials. Think about it:
Isn&#39;t Reddit owned by a corporation?
Many websites, including some sketchy ones, will allow people access to admin files, or user info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The situation has already been cleared up, and nobody accused anyone of working for, let alone mentioned, TPTB.</p>

<p>That said, if you haven&#39;t looked into &#39;hasbara&#39; or Cass Sunstein, you really should.</p>

<p>Here is a link for the latter: <a href="http://www.salon.com/2010/01/15/sunstein_2/">http://www.salon.com/2010/01/15/sunstein_2/</a></p>

<p><em>&quot;Sunstein advocates that the Government’s stealth infiltration should be accomplished by sending covert agents into “chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups.”  He also proposes that the Government make secret payments to so-called “independent” credible voices to bolster the Government’s messaging (on the ground that those who don’t believe government sources will be more inclined to listen to those who appear independent while secretly acting on behalf of the Government).   This program would target those advocating false “conspiracy theories,” which they define to mean: “an attempt to explain an event or practice by reference to the machinations of powerful people, who have also managed to conceal their role.”</em></p>

<p>It is on PB as well, and numerous articles have been written on it.  I also included a link to Ryan Dawson&#39;s latest video on vimeo, which someone else posted directly to this sub already.  It should be easy to find.</p>

<p>My guess is that supercede is hasbara.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Curious, to say the least, even if that is not the case in this instance.</p>

<p>One would think that a vetting process would have been in order, especially around here and especially considering certain groups have made it a point publicly to infiltrate social networks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. I have never seen even one post on r/conspiracy by supercede. Then suddenly he is a Mod? No vetting, no voting, a complete unknown to regular participants.</p>

<p>IMO that is very subversive.  </p>
