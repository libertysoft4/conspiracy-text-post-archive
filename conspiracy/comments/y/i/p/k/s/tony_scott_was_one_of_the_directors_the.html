        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After the 9-11 attacks, it was widely reported that the government met with Hollywood directors and producers to help them come up with attack ideas. The producers thought they were coming up with ideas so we could stop potential attacks, but they were really being used to help plan false flags. Tony Scott was one of those directors. He got too close. He was too accurate. He knew a false flag using his idea had happened or was about to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By you directing me to the gentlemans guide, are you helping me look out for them or accusing me?</p>

<p>Because I can assure you that I&#39;m just a dude with an interest in the alternative way of thinking.</p>

<p>Straight talking here, I was trying to be a bigger ass hole than you. I just haven&#39;t got the energy for that so you win. The assange thing was a little comic dig at our previous conversation elsewhere. Did not mean to take this off topic at all. With regards to the Tony Scott thing, there is very little suspicious evidence (IMO)  at the moment and was just fed up with the influx of this topic so soon. I don&#39;t think it does us any credit as a community to jump on every event too quickly, and cry conspiracy. The boy who cried wolf comes to mind.</p>

<p>Peace bro</p>

    <div class="md"><p>p.s. I should also add (and truly, this is just a helpful offering to consider)...</p>

<p>If you decide r/conspiracy isn&#39;t for you, but want to continue exploring similar material from a skeptical point of view, there&#39;s a subreddit for that: r/skeptic</p>

<p>If you decide you hate us and want to teach us a lesson for being wackjob nutcases crying wolf, there&#39;s a subreddit for that, too. r/conspiratard</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting you join either of those at this time. I&#39;m just saying... here, we discuss and explore conspiracy theories. I think you could be an asset to this subreddit once you understand what this community is doing... how it does it (sometimes with rank speculation as a beginning point)... et cetera.</p>

<p>Again...</p>

While I do agree that more facts should be posted to help his theory be proven either right or wrong. This is how this sub used to work, it went theory first, secondly, discussion and possible &quot;evidence&quot;  for or against said theory, <strong>finally</strong> opinions were formed. not anymore sadly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The obvious connnection: Tony Scott wrote the script and planned the Aurora attacks. It makes perfect sense when you think about it, and now I can&#39;t see it going down any other way. They hire Scott to write the script for the events, they carry out the attacks just as he wrote, but he either realizes that he wasn&#39;t writing a drill, or just suddenly wants to blow the whistle, and then they clean up. Look at his filmography. There&#39;s no one in Hollywood who they would have wanted to pick before him. Now that my mind has opened up to this theory, it&#39;s the only viable option. </p>

<p>While you will likely be (eventually) harassed for making huge speculative leaps, that&#39;s how theories are formed. That&#39;s how we, as a group, vet information. By asking &quot;what if&quot;, based on existing fact (e.g., in this instance, his filmography).</p>

<p>So can we answers this are all the other directors Alive? I do not buy for a second he has been bumped off. At least with the amount of facts presented. Yet to see a fact of any kind that can be substantiated </p>
