<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> doesn&#39;t get the front page, thats a simple fact. Either I havn&#39;t been here for a long enough time and have missed alot of frontpage threads or something is up.</p>

<p>If you saw the image you would see that both threads about aurora that made the front page depict a 4chan thread. Both of these threads made the frontpage and gave us a very bad rep. After all, any community that votes up a thread sourcing 4chan and is having serious discussions on it, is automatically concidered to be a pit of steaming shit. And rightfully so.</p>

<p>Either 4chan members are trolling us hard or some psy op is going on to discredit and make a laughing stock of the lable conspiracy theorist. The third option is that we are surrounded by ignorant people and they do infact furiously upvote such stupid threads.</p>

<p>The oldest frontpage thread is by cessik, looking at the guys history he is a frequent visitor of our subreddit and is a 2 year member of Reddit which leads me to believe that his thread was posted with no harmful intentions. The second account &quot;naesgib&quot; who has posted the most recent aurora thread has joined reddit 6 months ago. About half of his post are 6 months old and al the rest is spaced out over quite long periods of time. This account must thus be his second account or perhaps he simply uses Reddit very sparsly (we all know that using reddit once a month is not something many people do).  He normally never posts on our subreddit so first I started to think that he did have harmful intentions. But looking at his messages and what he is saying he&#39;s behaviour is pretty normal. I don&#39;t want to make any conclusions on this guy but we must note that the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thread he made was out of the ordinary concidering his behaviour prior to posting.</p>

<p>If you browse our subreddit and look at all the threads and their votes one can get a sense of how our community reacts. How active we are, what we prefer, how many upvotes a thread gets in the best of cases etc etc...</p>

<p>Now ask yourself wether the Aurora threads stand out or not, wether the voting behaviour is in sync with the rest of our threads. Obviously not. Is it because we conspiracy tards are passionate about the subject and upvote in a impulsive sort of way, is 4chan trolling us or is psy op throwing dirt at us?</p>

<p>Why do genuinly good threads never get to the front page? Is it because we don&#39;t like to read much? I don&#39;t think so, we are after all redditors and we are used to reading walls of texts. I think that we don&#39;t have enough participating members to get us frontpage time, the low vote count on threads is a testament to this. So I only two possibly conclusions are left. 4chan (the more likely case) or psy op. These kinds of threads are fucked up on so many levels and bring disinfo and confusion to the masses, mods should label these threads somehow.</p>

<p>What do you guys think? </p>

<p>Edit: The conclusion (for me) at this moment is that it is a regular psy op. LegioIXHispana pointed out that such an act would be too contrived for the likes of /b/. Lessons learned: keep your eyes open and investigate if something is feeling weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The LIBOR testimony evidence isn&#39;t there and that 4chan post made to the top page of reddit. Great, what an awesome way to make our subreddit look even more unhinged than mass upvoting a sensationalized 4chan submission that has no real sources backing it up other than the basic conflicts within the &quot;official story&quot; (Ie. gas masks, police transmissions, multiple shooters, etc.) that we already know... </p>

<p>And plus, why does it have to be a &quot;4chan&quot; submission that gets this type of attention? I wonder the amount of upvotes a different image submission would have gotten had it of been just plain text over a background image, instead of it being 4chan. As if because 4chan said it, it must be true? I don&#39;t know, this whole disinfo trend occuring in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is becoming very prevalant and is really eating away at the goal of this subreddit.</p>

<p>If you want to change peoples minds, you have to first research and present credible information and not jump onto the first conspiracy bandwagon and preach it as the gospel of truth. Stay vigilant <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, of both the TPTB and disinformation. </p>

<p>This subreddit is being gamed. It isn&#39;t being gamed <em>by</em> 4chan, though, it&#39;s just being made to look like that. If 4channers are drawn here because of the gaming-in-their-name, that&#39;s a different story. But I don&#39;t think this is a &quot;4chan invasion&quot;. </p>

<p>Yes. We were invaded. ImJulianAssange mentioned the possiblity of selling his account if Julian Assange was granted asylum. Don&#39;t think there aren&#39;t purchased accounts with longevity and karma in this subreddit shilling and trolling. And don&#39;t forget the <a href="http://redd.it/uomeb">Bilderberg rush - which never really subsided</a>.</p>

<p>This subreddit is being gamed by all manner of invasive forces. But it&#39;s quite apparent that the Batman Case is very near the center of it. The mountains and mountains of contradictions to the official released story are staggering.</p>

<p>They&#39;re also dismissing the possibility that Robert Holmes (James&#39; father), the author of the most sophisticated financial tracking software in the world, might have been a potential witness in the LIBOR scandal simply because Sorcha Faal had mentioned it in conjunction with some other stuff that can&#39;t be proven or might be false. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yf91m/james_holmes_father_was_not_going_to_testify_at/c5v12dw?context=3">This is an attempt to <em>bury</em> the examination of Robert Holmes connection to LIBOR.</a></p>

<p>Many references and citations <strong>separate</strong> from the single questionable assertion of being a witness. I think the name of the software is even mentioned so you can google that too.</p>

<p>Or, mock and ridicule the documentary. You know... whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not ridiculing you, i just want you to use critical thinking. Here is what the #1 comment on the article you posted as a source says about your video: So I think I will again have to play my part as a detractor.</p>

<p>I watched the video. Watch this documentary and than look how the The Libor/Holmes connection is sourced [starts at 10:40 and goes to 12:40]. Not a single person, institution or other verifiable source is used. We hear only Mark Howitt aka LordDefiler, the maker of the video. He repeats claims he has read elsewhere on the internet. He uses a more or less blurry facebook screenshot [at 10:41] and then narrates - &quot;this report says&quot;. This is were his info comes from.</p>

<hr/>

<p>To give credibility to your argument, the base of your argument must be derived from a valid source. All this video does is repeat verbatim the Sorcha Faal Article- which may indeed be true- but it is just a conjecture- i agree that this is worth pursuing to find out, but there has to be a primary source somewhere, a newspaper article, something from congress, anything that is a valid source.</p>

<p>Simply linking to something that repeats the conjecture you are trying to prove doesnt make it valid. No is out to get you, well, atleast im not. Im just pointing out that you are reaching an illogical or unprovable conclusion because you are basing your premise on conjecture rather than fact. Now that you have the idea, go find the facts to back it up. </p>

<p>I think the reason people lash out at you is because they dont want to believe that our country, the place built on the &quot;american dream&quot;, would do something like this. But if they did, i want to know about it. </p>

<p>Wrong. That&#39;s falling for their trick. You swallowed it.</p>

<p>The only thing I have to do is prove that their argument (argument from mockery, and subsequent dismissal of everything else in the movie) is invalid. My goal is not to prove the movie is right. My goal is to prove that the movie and its perspectives and questions should not be dismissed just because someone can pick holes in some of the details. MOST of the movie covers easily documented factual information. A very <strong>small</strong> portion of it speculates based on questionable sources (Sorcha Faal). Their argument is: Because Sorcha Faal said &quot;blah&quot; (and they quote that shit ad nauseum) you mist dismiss this and never look at it again. Ever. EVER. EVER, GODDAMMIT. I SAID EVAR!!! &lt;-- What the fuck is up with that shit. Do you not suspect a coverup? If not, I question YOUR sensibilities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simply linking to something that repeats the conjecture you are trying to prove</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turning the tables. I&#39;m making no conjecture. The conjectures are made by others. My argument is, and always has been: STOP DISMISSING SHIT THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Im not ridiculing you, i just want you to use critical thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are asserting that I am not using critical thinking, then.</p>

<p>So, fuck you. You&#39;re not my ally. GTFO. --&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Anyway this kind of discussion is good i think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you are right. A bit too contrived.</p>

<p>So than the only thing that is left is basic psy op. We as a community should make it our goal to expose these kinds of things as fast as possible. And instead of participating in those threads (I have participiated in them so im at fault in this too) we have to notify our fellow tards of the reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm...either 4chan, full of notorious trollers, is trolling <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, full of people who will believe anything.  </p>

<p>Or a statistically insignificant group of anti-semites is being targeted for a highly complex Psy Op mission to spread disinformation over a tragedy perpetrated by a mentally ill man.</p>

<p>Yep, Psy Ops.  Clearly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This issue is a good chance to rethink what the community thinks is front-page worthy. Now while it is a 4chan link, it did make a good point. It at least questioned the official account. I&#39;d give this one to 4chan, but tell Reddit to be wary of knee-jerk upvotage in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the 4chan post too, the problem is there is no real source evidence for all the claims. I can believe that the media is simply covering it up but we have no ground to stand on in terms of discussing this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is kind of true, because without either of us actually being there, it can still be put down to speculation. However, I still have to give points to 4chan for at least breaking character and engaging in some patriotic action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t hold up if you look at voting behaviour on this subreddit. Having votes shoot up to 1500 is an anomaly. And having (basicly) the same thread shoot up to the front page is not a coincidence.</p>
