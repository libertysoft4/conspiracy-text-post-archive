    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It&#39;s been clear for a year that there&#39;s a concerted, intended effort to quash public discussion and data. I&#39;ve contested multiple attackers and deniers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion there&#39;s something deeply awry in all this, perhaps that TEPCO was processing bomb materials too at the site and now they and the government(s) must by all means play this down against public exposure which would be devastating for Japan and partners. Reddit is collateral damage.</p>

<p>By the way, there&#39;s an Israel connection in all this; Israel had installed remote-viewing equipment at Fukushima. One has to ask why. My guess is to monitor processing of materials for them, and they wanted tight security on it. No one in the press has asked why that country had video monitoring there.</p>

<p>&quot;Magna BSP was established by Siboni about 10 years ago and is owned by several partners. Based in Dimona, the firm employs 15 people, a number which Siboni expects to expand dramatically in light of additional orders Magna has received from Japan and interest shown by the operators of nuclear reactors in other countries. Its operations in Japan are conducted through a Japanese government firm.</p>

<p>“We have an agreement in principle with the Japanese that we will provide protection for all of the country’s nuclear reactors,” Siboni said.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean to say that the nuclear power industry does not process bomb materials though some nuclear weapons have been made into nuclear reactor fuel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mixed oxide fuel, commonly referred to as MOX fuel, is nuclear fuel that contains more than one oxide of fissile material. MOX fuel contains plutonium blended with natural uranium, reprocessed uranium, or depleted uranium... One attraction of MOX fuel is that it is a way of utilizing surplus weapons-grade plutonium ...
Reprocessing of commercial nuclear fuel to make MOX is done in the United Kingdom and France, and to a lesser extent in Russia, India and Japan. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOX_fuel">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOX_fuel</a></p>

<p>Reactor 3 at Fukushima Daiichi was using MOX fuel. But the failures there didn&#39;t have anything to do with that though it did make things worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are quite a few people who seem to think that Magna, the Israeli firm that did &quot;security&quot; at Fukushima, installed a small tactical nuke disguised as a &quot;stereoscopic camera.&quot;</p>

<p>Japan offered to do enrichment work for Iran which, of course, the Zionists were not pleased about...enter Stuxnet and the nuke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that Israel bombed the power plant is just absurd. The explosions at the plant were clearly exactly what they were described as. </p>

<p>If you look at images of the plant now and images of the plant during the explosion, the nearby buildings are nearly untouched. If there was any sort of fission/fusion weapon behind that explosion, all of those buildings would have been flattened. Those reactor buildings all house spent fuel pools with thousands of fuel rod assemblies, all of which would have been destroyed if the explosion was from a fission or fusion device. Such an explosion would have caused an environmental catastrophe that would have likely destroyed much of Japan and had serious ramifications for the rest of the world so what possible motive would Israel have for such a crime? And just because an explosion leaves a mushroom cloud, it doesn&#39;t mean that it was caused by a fission or fusion device.</p>

<p>Also, how come the Japanese, with all of the radiation sensors that must have been at that plant, never detected the ~20kg of uranium sitting on their roof. Or maybe they did and just ignored it? How did that work.</p>

<p>Not to mention that gun-type nuclear weapons have long been obsolete for any technologically capable manufacturer. Implosion-type weapons are more compact, more efficient and safer. </p>

<p>Seriously, this shouldn&#39;t take more than a little common sense to debunk. Just because some random idiot makes a baseless assertion on a website somewhere, it does not mean that it is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s get it down to to 4kg or less.</p>

<p>&quot;The isotope plutonium-239 is a key fissile component in nuclear weapons, due to its ease of fission and availability. Encasing the bomb&#39;s plutonium pit in a tamper (an optional layer of dense material) decreases the amount of plutonium needed to reach critical mass by reflecting escaping neutrons back into the plutonium core. This reduces the amount of plutonium needed to reach criticality from 16 kg to 10 kg, which is a sphere with a diameter of about 10 centimeters (4 in).[73] This critical mass is about a third of that for uranium-235.[8]
The &quot;Fat Man&quot;-type plutonium bombs produced during the Manhattan Project used explosive compression of plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal, combined with a central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency. Thus only 6.2 kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT.[64][74] (See also Nuclear weapon design.) Hypothetically, as little as 4 kg of plutonium—and maybe even less—could be used to make a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs.[74]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh it happened all right (my grandfather was locked up in camps for three years) and no doubt millions were killed.</p>

<p>The &quot;six million&quot; number has been proven to be phony though and has been &quot;revised down&quot; through history many times. If you bothered to read the link you would see why the number &quot;six million&quot; was chosen instead of the &quot;real&quot; number (likely 2-2.5 million). Not like it matters, killing even one person is wrong. It is simply a point to illustrate that Zionists are NEVER above &quot;lying for the cause.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>solar and wind are &quot;viable.&quot; But only in the sense that you could build enough of them where they are needed.  Electricity is drawn off the grid at the first point it is needed, so transporting energy from the a field in say the desert (solar) or the great plains (wind) half way across the country would be near impossible (not to mention HORRIBLY expensive to maintain the lines, transformers, etc). </p>

<p>Wave (tidal) energy is absurd.  It requires an ocean, so only costal communities would be able to benefit.  Not to mention oceans are full of salt water, which is terribly corrosive on any parts of tidal turbines. Upkeep costs alone would make prices insane. </p>

<p>Coal and nuclear (although I agree with you, terrible for the environment) are the most viable with current technology.  You can build the plants anywhere.  No natural energy or phenomena are depended upon for the generation of the electricity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s get it down to to 4kg or less.</p>

<p>&quot;The isotope plutonium-239 is a key fissile component in nuclear weapons, due to its ease of fission and availability. Encasing the bomb&#39;s plutonium pit in a tamper (an optional layer of dense material) decreases the amount of plutonium needed to reach critical mass by reflecting escaping neutrons back into the plutonium core. This reduces the amount of plutonium needed to reach criticality from 16 kg to 10 kg, which is a sphere with a diameter of about 10 centimeters (4 in).[73] This critical mass is about a third of that for uranium-235.[8]
The &quot;Fat Man&quot;-type plutonium bombs produced during the Manhattan Project used explosive compression of plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal, combined with a central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency. Thus only 6.2 kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT.[64][74] (See also Nuclear weapon design.) Hypothetically, as little as 4 kg of plutonium—and maybe even less—could be used to make a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs.[74]&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;d say your point on it being too large to be detected is refuted. </p>
