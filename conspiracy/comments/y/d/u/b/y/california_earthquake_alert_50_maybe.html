        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Current Conclusion:
Eyebrows are raised.
Poised. 
Watching closely now until it goes away.
If it gets worse I will be more worried.
As for the timing, I have no idea.</p>

<p>Low Alert Level.</p>

<p>**Make sure your plot scale is even big enough. Try 250, 500, 1000, and then 2000 and see if you see any differences.</p>

<p>As of today, looking at HAARP data we have already reached a disturbance of over 500 points.  </p>

<p>Looking at the Yorba Linda earthquake that only registered at 4.x, a prior disturbance reached a 400 peak and an 800 difference in the warning.  </p>

<p>The earthquake itself was about a 500 difference in total.  </p>

<p>Right now we are past a 500 peak and a 1000 difference in warning speculation.  </p>

<p>I barely know anything.  I am not a reliable source.  However I thought this is worth putting out there.  Normally we should just not see these numbers unless seismic activity is occurring.  </p>

<p>What concerns me is that the data looks incomplete, as if it still rising.  It hasn&#39;t been going down.</p>

<p>So therefore, I propose we start watching closely.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/magnetometer/magchain.cgi">http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/magnetometer/magchain.cgi</a></p>

<p>Any update from the guy who predicted the japan tsunami?</p>

<p>If it rises further in the next 4 hour mark we might have a 4.0+ earthquake on our hands.</p>

<p>NEW EDIT</p>

<p>FURTHER RISING</p>

<p>Time for a screen shot that will not make any sense.  Before it said that the values were twice as high earlier how did I miss this? I had it in an old window and here is the values let me check the date and I might upload or delete this message maybe I used the wrong dates.</p>

<p>Here it is. This one says its nearly at 1000 peak.  <a href="http://imageshack.us/f/18/important3.png/">http://imageshack.us/f/18/important3.png/</a></p>

<p>I found out that the values show higher when you have 2 weeks selected.  What is this?******* (Can some one try this themselves?)******</p>

<p>As for the Yorba Linda earthquake I felt it when I was working.  It was short but so violent. 
Data pertaining to that quake:
<a href="http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/riometer/riom2_sel.cgi?absorb=on&amp;pstyle=log&amp;meas=on&amp;qdc=on&amp;pwidth=36H&amp;endTime=20120807">http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/riometer/riom2_sel.cgi?absorb=on&amp;pstyle=log&amp;meas=on&amp;qdc=on&amp;pwidth=36H&amp;endTime=20120807</a>

<p>Noticed the anomaly. First link shows the crisscrossing of red and blue. From what I understand this is indication of something happening.  The second link shows some strange readings as well.  A sudden spike and intensity.</p>

<p>I think the kaktovic location is more responsive despite being further because it is placed nearly at the peak of a fault line as seen here. </p>

<p>NEW EDIT
MISSING DATA
1.7HZ HAS BEEN ACTIVATED FOR SOME TIME
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&amp;v=k1cKrrEQmrY&amp;NR=1">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&amp;v=k1cKrrEQmrY&amp;NR=1</a> Its within the first few minutes of video I did not watch the whole thing to be honest I am in a hurry here.</p>

<p>Check this out for reference.  I just put in a few random dates and looked up earth quakes relating to this increased and constant wave theorized to be created from some man made object.</p>

<p>February 2012, 2nd. 
<a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqarchives/poster/2012/20120202.php">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqarchives/poster/2012/20120202.php</a>
<a href="http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/scmag/disp-scmag.cgi?Bx=on&amp;date=20120202">http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/scmag/disp-scmag.cgi?Bx=on&amp;date=20120202</a></p>

<p>This was 7.0! And the frequency was just a bit lower than the 20110311!  What is going on here.  What the hell.  </p>

<p>THE MISSING DATA IS FOR 8/16/2012, AND WHEN IT IS TURNED ON, TODAY, YOU CAN SEE THE FREQUENCY HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR SOME TIME.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/scmag/disp-scmag.cgi?Bx=on&amp;date=20120202">http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/scmag/disp-scmag.cgi?Bx=on&amp;date=20120202</a></p>

<p>You can see that there were waves of 3.0 Hz and even higher trickling from 8/16/2012.  Where else is this evidence? The same feb 2nd earthquake.  </p>

<p>NOT EVERYTHING WAS MISSING FROM 8/16/2012.  Look at these graphs and compare them to 20110311 <a href="http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/riometer/riom2_sel.cgi?absorb=on&amp;pstyle=log&amp;meas=on&amp;qdc=on&amp;pwidth=36H&amp;endTime=20120818">http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/riometer/riom2_sel.cgi?absorb=on&amp;pstyle=log&amp;meas=on&amp;qdc=on&amp;pwidth=36H&amp;endTime=20120818</a>.  Eerily similar to 20110311.  Look at the red and blue making ovals.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my wild assumption.  Graph goes crazy during earthquakes, and before them.  Simply look up big earthquakes somewhere vaguely around alaska.  Think pacific ocean.</p>

<p>Look at the dates of the tsunami in japan.  Just look for yourself.  I am trying to get this information in the hands of someone who knows what to do with this information.</p>

<p>Also, try to find an earthquake that happened in a high magnitude (7+, 8+? where these graphs were flat lining). Still, this is for western regions.</p>

<p>I think at one point I looked up an earthquake in mexico and referenced the dates with this site.  I think the graphs correlated with the dates.  I will check again.</p>
