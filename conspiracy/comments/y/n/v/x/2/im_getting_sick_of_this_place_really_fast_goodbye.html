        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Things have been getting weird this week. Like really weird. The troll invasion has stepped up big time in the last few days, and I am now spending most of my time interacting with the trolls rather than having good conversation as usual. They keep flagging posts as spam so I have to approve them before they get seen. They are gaming posts via twitter. I&#39;m calling it quits guys. It&#39;s been a great 9 months here, and I won&#39;t forget any of you. I&#39;m going to stick around for a few more days to make sure that this sub will have a strong and active leader to fill my old spot before I go. There are a couple of mods still active occasionally, but I need someone who can be on here most of their waking life to fill my spot. Any takers should PM me and I will take it from there. I have a lot going on in life right now. I think I&#39;m ready to turn the page. Much love <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and thank you all.</p>

<p>EDIT: Due to the MASSIVE attention this post received and the amount of support I have received, I have no choice but to stay. I&#39;m just going to take a break for a while and clear my head and recharge my spirit. I&#39;ll be back and better than ever. ;)</p>

<p>Thanks guys. You make this place great, not me. My role is small compared to you the users. I couldn&#39;t do it without all of you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at 9000&#39;s comment history. The dude has been pegged over the past few days. I was downvoted to hell and called crazy for saying that we had been infiltrated. I&#39;m fucking pissed off about this...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know exactly what is going on, and I won&#39;t claim to KNOW because that would be pure speculation. I personally THINK there is a bit of poisoning the well by either rude, asshole Jones jocks, or sockpuppet forum-sliding accounts. We know that conspiratard has been hitting us hard, and especially annoying the primary users of this subreddit. It is fucked up.</p>

<p>The type of discussion that has been taking place over the past week or so is absolutely not a genuine representation of this community. Those whom have been here for a while know how incredible this subreddit can be...</p>

<p><strong>We need to be posting legitimate examples of conspiracy/corruption/coersion with credible sources and highly insightful discussion around the sources. The bottom line is that the nonsense needs to be exorcised out of here, and this subreddit needs to embrace purifying itself of all contradictions. We need truth, not contradiction. We need to be prepared to accept when we&#39;re wrong, and dig deep in research to prove our points. WE NEED TO HAVE INTEGRITY.</strong></p>

<p>If someone provides well sourced evidence that is logical and presented in a respectful way, then regardless of its conclusions, it should be welcomed as valuable discussion. The kinds of devils advocate questions as well as well sourced critical materials SHOULD BE received in a productive capacity, whereby a thought-provoking discussion can arise. <strong>What is not acceptable is the negatively sarcastic, straw-man/ad hominem ridden arguments that are mere bickering. This subreddit needs to get fucking classy, in a hurry. We need to adopt posting methods similar to r/truereddit.</strong> </p>

<p>I wish you wouldn&#39;t go, 9000. We can straighten this thing out with a change in the ethos around here. We need to take the highground as a community. We know we are historically, economically, and politically in the correct position, we just have to do the hard work to credibly and respectfully express ourselves. </p>

<p>I genuinely love each and every one of you, and want each of you to show the integrity that I know you have. Lets take the high-ground and source/discuss/ non-violently communicate our way out of this rut. We can do this. Join me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eternal september springs to mind. Scourge of internet communitys the net over.  Reddit is somewhat resilient due to the subreddit system. The attraction of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for many would be the free thinking and hands off approach of the mods and it may be that tight moderation with clear objectives is required.

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great question, and I certainly appreciate you asking it. My apologies for a delayed response, I made that post and then went to bed. </p>

<p>So, where to begin.. My general concept is that the true users begin posting in a more serious, academic manner. I sincerely believe that our trolling issue will be resolved if we create a new general ethos here, whereby everyone attempts to respectfully post their critiques in a sourced way, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">&quot;non-violent communication&quot;</a> as the initial approach to speaking with someone. </p>

<p>I believe that if one posts a link containing a theory that lacks verisimilitude, or clearly has little sources to back up any claims, the poster should post their degree of certainty to the information. For instance they could say: &quot;I understand there are some speculative aspects of this article&quot;. Our problems arise when we post links and claim them as being &quot;the truth&quot; or &quot;knowledge&quot;... </p>

<p>I follow the continuum of Imagine -- Think -- Believe -- Know... Perhaps this kind of a continuum could be used to rank speculation. Starting backward, the <a href="http://conspiraciesthatweretrue.blogspot.com/2007/01/list-of-proven-conspiracies-from.html">list of proven conspiracies</a> would be considered KNOWLEDGE, for example. pointing out certain facts about relationships and witnessing certain results can teeter on knowledge and belief, depending on the evidence of criminality/collusion ect (this is where the discussion on this subreddit can thrive)..  BELIEF can be almost completely proven, but details may require more research. THINKING is essentially speculative; however, known facts that are loosely, perhaps interdisciplinarily connected can be discussed to sort out where there are contradictions and what topics there are where factual connections can be found. IMAGINARY posts are purely speculative with virtually no empirical evidence.</p>

<p>As I mentioned last night, even posts that are obviously in the realm of imagination should be welcomed here, because perhaps those looking for credibility in this sub can provide the OP with resources that will shed light on what aspects have integrity, and could use further research, or what statements are contradictory or fallacious. In this kind of a situation it is important that violent or hurtful words are never used, as the OP is just someone who is simply trying to make sense of reality. Attempting to have some integrity, We should try to teach them what Knowledge there is on said topic, and encourage a use of language that admits speculation. </p>

<p>Back to my original point, we should instill an ethos similar to r/truereddit, so that lively discussion can take place, and those disinformation or trolling can more easily be seen. </p>

To maintain the focus on great articles, Please (follow especially this part of the reddiquette and) do: <strong>Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something. But only if you really think it might help the poster improve.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>In general, we need to change our sidebar and our posting rules. </p>

<p>This is not going to cut it any longer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This subreddit is for the REDACTED and the discussion of REDACTED that may or may not have REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED government agents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to be specific that posts here need to foster sound sourcing, and respectful argumentation. We need a subreddit description similar to that of true-reddit, that acts as our statement of purpose. I&#39;m speaking here about a rebranding of this subreddit. </p>

<p>In terms of dealing with highly antagonistic posters, or trolls, I think any poster who consistently posts negatively sarcastic, grossly unhelpful, or spiteful adhominem/strawman-arguments, should be reported to the mods by the community and downvoted accordingly. The &quot;punishment&quot; is between the mods and that poster. If it escalates to a point, than that user should be shadow-banned IMO. I&#39;m not sure how many users actually get banned here, but if we rebrand this subreddit and encourage non-violent communication, the &quot;trolls&quot; will become very apparent, and hopefully the community itself will &quot;smite them out&quot;.</p>

<p>I also believe we should encourage users to link their posts to some kind of degree of factual certainty. The Imagine-Think-Believe-Know continuum could be a basis for this (potentially quantitative) ranking... It would really serve to self-regulate the seriousness, or academic level of a post itself...   </p>

<p>This will be my only response to you. You are not welcome here. Your comments degrade the credible discussion that could potentially take place. I&#39;m interested in verisimilitude, and you are obviously not. </p>

<p>The &quot;insanely far-fetched conspiracy non-theories&quot; are welcomed here, because you know what--- perhaps those looking for credibility here can provide them with resources that will shed light on what has integrity and could use further research, or what perhaps may be contradictory or fallacious. I would never throw violent or hurtful words out at someone who is simply trying to make sense of reality. Attempting to have some integrity, I would try to teach them what Knowledge there is on said topic, and encourage a use of language that admits speculation. </p>

<p>Please, try it on someone who cares. I&#39;m sorry you and your retard chain gang don&#39;t like people questioning the dumber crap you throw out there, but if you want to serious discuss conspiracies, you are going to have to seriously discuss conspiracies. </p>

<p>People who act like enraged gorillas  when someone suggests &quot;Jews don&#39;t control the world&quot; are a larger impediment towards <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s goals than nasty words from a skeptic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait a minute.
You can&#39;t just leave. You just can step back a little bit and put fewer effort in this subreddit, if you wish.</p>

<p>You sir, are a rare species. If I had been in your position, I would have banned the fuck out of everybody who is actively destroying (flagging) this subreddit.</p>

<p>But not you. You were tolerant and democratic.
Howsoever your decision will be, I do thank you for your service. Not many have the guts to be as active, because we prefer a less responsibility as possible, if we have a private life to live.</p>

<p>But having a function which alter the curse of perception is a very important function. So beware to whom you are giving it to. If this subreddit falls into the wrong hands, it would be  a serious pity.</p>

<p>I am not trying to convince you to stay, because as a man, we have to take a stand after we spoke. However. That does not mean, that it will be forever and ultimate. So, just take a break and return.</p>

<p>But here is something which bothered me with you. You kept on mentioning that people are corrupting this subreddit by systematically conspiring against it. But (except from a link to <a href="/r/conspiratards">/r/conspiratards</a>) you did not provide and evidence. If people knew what you know. I&#39;m telling this to you, because everyday I come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I never see any suspicious things going on. So for the reader the things you claim are pretty invisible. </p>

<p>However again. Take a break. And come back whenever you see it fits to you. We will be here. Don&#39;t be ultimate because only the dark side talks in absolutes :D</p>

<p>Keep it up. With appreciation. From around the world.</p>

You have places like conspiritard who are taking time out of their day to mock and collude against the subreddit and to infiltrate posts with downvote brigades and to slide topics. Be here and be fucking smart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been honest about having multiple accounts. I have also been honest about having an ancient PC that is unable to wield the kind of power you suggest I have. I cannot even run RES, let alone manage to somehow game the voting on any post.</p>

<p>But, feel free to characterize me however you want.</p>

<p>What I will acknowledge, however, is that I turned loose a monster on reddit. I informed every troll, shill, and sockpuppeteer how to more effectively game the system. Yes, I did that. But, I have not gamed it myself. (I tried a couple times, but as I said... my system just isn&#39;t fit for that - 1999 Dell running Win98 and firefox 2.0.0.20. Manually disconnecting my modem to gain a new IP and rebooting my PC to clear out any traces of the old one... not very effective.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a thought about this whole invasion situation and I&#39;d just like to get some confirmation of the plausibility of my idea from you as a mod (since you have access to this sub&#39;s stats and the like). I&#39;d address my comment to 9000 but I&#39;m afraid he may have left us already, so here goes. </p>

<p>11 days ago, I submitted the TrapWire story here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I believe I was the first to do so, as my post gained pretty good traction and attained around 200 points.</p>

<p>Now, here&#39;s the thing. At the same time, I was actively commenting all over the 2000+ point post on the same story over at <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a>. One of my top-level comments, however, included a link to something a commenter in my <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> post said. And well, I didn&#39;t expect it at all, but it got a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/y1w9d/stratfor_emails_reveal_secret_widespread_trapwire/c5rn1n8">whole lot of attention</a>.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m basically just wondering... Could a sizeable influx of <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> subscribers who had no interest in this subreddit before, be a possible explanation for a lot of the perceived &quot;trolls, shills, and disinfo agents&quot; we&#39;ve seen here over the last two weeks or so? Assuming this was their first exposure to this sub, it would kind of make sense... </p>

<p>Of course, I may be vastly overestimating the impact of that comment and the users it drove to this sub, but judging by my upvotes (155) on that comment and its positioning in the main comment arena in <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a>, combined with the fact that the story was really a bit of a wakeup call to a lot of people otherwise unacquainted with conspiracy theories and how we do things in this sub... I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it sparked quite an interest and/or maybe a couple dozen cross-subscribers from <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> in a very short space of time. Oh and that <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> post front-paged for pretty much two days straight... </p>

<p>Oh and by the way, this account I&#39;m posting from is only about 2 weeks old, but that&#39;s because I had to create a new one from my older shadowbanned account (which 9000sins kindly informed me of, after going through my comment history and presumably making the right assumption that I have a lot to potentially contribute here in this sub).</p>

<p>Would love to get your opinion on this theory of mine. Could be totally unrelated to any mischief going on here in the last while, but I thought it was worth a shot to bring it to your attention.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all your fault.  kidding.  I think that there have been a lot of conspiracy related front page stories and that there have been a lot of us commenting and telling people to come here, so you may have contributed somewhat.  I had a post during the trapwire front page marathon that said &quot;so the conspiracy theorists have been right!&quot; and it was a top comment right under the top comment and I believe it was one of the main posters here said &quot;come join us at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot; and I was like &quot;already there, I post every day&quot; so that could have led to another influx of people.  I think since a lot of what we talk about here is coming to fruition in the mainstream a lot of people are drawn here out of curiosity and then once they realize that the information presented here does not fit their narrative of life, they decide to troll and be general dickhole downvoters.  That is a scenario, I think, that is totally possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for backing me up with your own story. I remember the other couple of front-paging <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posts, too. </p>

<p>I guess all of this is quite obvious (the more uninitiated people who come here with little to no experience or research into many of the topics covered, the more general dickholery, and also a general and noticeable increase in gang-downvoting) but I think it&#39;s important for everyone (especially the regulars) to be aware that this mostly organic and natural influx is a possible cause for what we&#39;ve been seeing lately. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just disheartening to think that a mod would just up and quit simply because there is too much dickholery to keep up with. In my humble opinion this is a terrible time, and a terrible reason, to leave as a mod. What we need right now more than ever is patience and level heads, because frankly, it really gives a bad impression to the subreddit as a whole to all the new subscribers. For one, they&#39;re not invested in any of this research yet, so of course that&#39;s going to lead to more trolling and thoughtless dismissals across the board. </p>

<p>Anyhow, that&#39;s all I wanted to say. </p>

<p>Edit: Just to clarify, I&#39;m not in any way questioning that gaming is/will always be taking place, just that we&#39;ve got to be careful about playing the blame game without good proof or &quot;reasonable&quot; suspicion. But I&#39;m not worried about that, the investigative work on real trolls and the naming and shaming has been pretty solid so far. </p>

<p>Has the 6000 year old conspiracy been solved?  Have we had a restoration of the constitution?  There are so many problems that still need to be solved and giving up on r/conspiracy is not what the movement needs right now.  </p>

<p>We need more people doing more.   I do appriciate what you have done for this community, but to give up now, before the world comes crashing down, is such a defeatist act.  </p>

<p>Be Strong.  Keep going.  If there are trolls it is because we are getting somewhere.  People are waking up.  </p>

<p>I understand you have a lot going on in your life, I do as well.  We all do.  </p>

<p>If we turn away our eyes, they win.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>So the conspiracy is old enough that the Constitution is a product of it, and yet is what we must fight to restore. There has been a split in the Illuminati! New &#39;reformers&#39; locked in a struggle with hard line old-timers who want to return to the good old days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, not familiar with Ralph Epperson?</p>

<p>Can&#39;t recomend his stuff enough.  He proves many many many things that you and I take for granted.  Here, they are long (i have the mp3 versions if you want: PM me), but he really examines what the fuck is going on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmOit3B1vKs">America&#39;s Secret Destiny</a> : The American Constitution has been called &quot;the finest document ever written by the mind of men!&quot; The American people have been taught that it was written to restrict the power of government, and to protect their God-given inalienable rights to life, liberty and property.</p>

<p>But Ralph Epperson has discovered the evidence that the men who founded this nation were not God-fearing patriots as we have been told, but occultic practitioners of a secret worship on this earth. In fact, he will discuss the evidence that our founding fathers created two separate governments in the Constitution at the same time, and ONE OF THOSE GOVERNMENTS WAS GIVEN ABSOLUTE TYRANNICAL POWER! And that this is the government ruling America today!</p>

<p>He will also examine the Great Seal of the United States and its hidden symbols.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN8zmXRweJ0">Conspiracy against Christianity</a> - Note: I am not a christian but even I cannot deny the evidence of this conspiracy.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK15iLD19qE">Only the US has Nukes</a> -- This is fascinating.  If you&#39;ve lived through the cold war, your socks will be blown off by this.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvUlTiNi1B0">Abolish the federal reserve</a> -- Many of us know about the FED but this is Ralph Epperson&#39;s take on it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w203gyIcsmQ">The Conspiratorial View of History</a> -- If you are in r/conspiracy you need to listen to this.  This is what we all believe but laid out perfectly. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwJhUvJyiII">Vietnam: America&#39;s Betrayal and Treason</a> -- If you are a vet, watch this, if you think you know something about Vietnam, watch this.  Basically I think everyone should watch this because it completely changes what the story of vietnam is and was to me.</p>

<p>Ralph Epperson, in my books, is pretty much outspoken on the subject of conspiracies.  He&#39;s been researching (HARD) for over 50 years, that&#39;s older than most of this subreddit so, in my opinion, we really need to embrace this man and his work.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in an AMA with Ralph Epperson?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude. Your last sentence is totally uncalled for, not to mention just plain rude.</p>

<p>For the record, genius, I presumed there must be some much more sophisticated operation regarding &quot;gaming&quot; Reddit via Twitter than just &quot;here&#39;s a link, downvote it&quot;. Fake accounts, bots, something I&#39;m not aware of, etc. Otherwise, everyone of them could just hang out in the subreddit and downvote everything.</p>

<p>In the short time I&#39;ve been in this subreddit, I think I&#39;ve added to the discussion, and with the main mod talking about the general degredation of this subreddit and quitting because of a lack of quality, I think it would be best to not attack members who contribute to the betterment of this community with snide and childish remarks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>mod-assigned flair can do that, but then users don&#39;t get to define their own. </p>

<p>But, I&#39;m opposed to mods assigning flair because it wields undue influence over people. It&#39;s no different than shill voting comments to make them appear more popular/more right/more whatever. Everyone needs to actually read and learn for themselves. It&#39;s the only way for people to actually wake up - and to be aware when invasions are occurring. If a rogue mod invades (see the Gentleperson&#39;s Guide to Forum Spies in the sidebar ---&gt;) they can then label their invading forces as trustworthy and the truly reliable people as not-so. It&#39;s a very dangerous thing to do. People need to wake up and learn for themselves who they can/can&#39;t trust.</p>

<p>I know there are a lot of comments in this thread, but take a look at what DomesticTerranist is doing to characterize me as a &quot;bad guy&quot; in all of this (shame on me for controlling my own subreddit as I see fit! How dare I!).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait...&quot;rogue mod&quot;?  What the fuck?  Do any mods possess any REAL power around here? </p>

<p>How hard is it to let a post go through with a mod warning on it?  If it&#39;s a good post and people get shitty about it fuck them.  The warning should be welcomed and then shot down if deemed fit.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re worried about people here not listening because of a &quot;tag&quot;, then fuck those people.  They won&#39;t listen with an open mind to truth anyway...and fuck them.</p>

I have other names for people like that and I group them together with people like tttottt who are just brainwashed by their Bible.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. </p>

<p>I worked in marketing for media outlets for many years.  I understand this dynamic well enough to give advice based on personal experience.  Something I rarely do, I mostly spout off stream of consciousness :P </p>

<p>What you are doing is working.  It is working so well you are being overwhelmed.  You should change absolutely nothing.  Sun Tsu probably says something about holding your ground when the villian is agitating you or rustling around uncomfortably trying to dissent.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should absolutely let the flood gates open and just allow anarchy in this forum for a while.  This would be attacking the and more powerful than holding ground. </p>

<p>The people coming here are a) paid to attack and are actually weak foot soldiers or B) New viewers who will eventually see the WHOLE truth.  Those are the people you want to be here, letter by letter, line by line, post by post, ah-ha moment after ah-ha moment is the only way. </p>

<p>The science nazi&#39;s are with us, they are just heavily indoctrinated into a false paradigm.  Honestly if you can break the gap between the hipster atheists paradigm of science and nasa into a route directly to where they can see the withheld truth.  If the spiritual warriors do not do this the false flag antichrist will.  They just don&#39;t believe the BIG lie, they are smart enough to get the million small lies and fallacies that undermine their intellect. </p>

<p>The more posts the bettor, the critical mass is coming, just keep it going for a while guys.  </p>

<p>Nonviolence. Truth and Intellect.<br/>
Question Authority.<br/>
The whole god damn thing IS a scam.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>9000sins -- &quot;I have been giving a lot of thought to this whole sub in last couple of days. I think I&#39;m going to take the advice of several of the users here and just take a break instead of just quitting. I love place so much. It just really sucks to how hard it can fall even when I&#39;m trying my hardest. I just feel like the wheel is spinning so fast that I can&#39;t grab it to take control. I just finally hooked up with the girl I told everyone about, the one that I have waited so many years for. My reality just got a whole lot brighter, so in a way I&#39;m so incredibly happy. I just want to focus more on my real life, and I feel that this is pulling me down most of the time anymore. Don&#39;t worry, though. I&#39;m not checking out, just taking some time for me. :)&quot;</p>

There are a lot of people who are subscribing here that have specific agendas I feel.

Idk if people are just so deep into the indoctrination that they don&#39;t see the really really obvious Marxism behind it, or if there are trolls seeking this type of post out and downvoting it.

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, brother. I care about you, and all other parties involved. I also really care about the project we are considering. I realize you have been stalked and downvoted to hell by a cadre this past week...</p>

<p>Perhaps 9000 should know what your demeanor is, and taken your abrasiveness with a grain of salt -- I don&#39;t have a clue how well he knows you -- I&#39;m telling you as a friend that you are getting too extreme. </p>

<p>An open-source project cannot work when the key-holder has an initiation process for understanding different aspects of the system. If we were &quot;in&quot; than you should have transparently explained IT ALL to us, in one location, understanding that the coding language was foreign to us. <strong>If you worked on this concept for many years, than you shouldn&#39;t expect us newbs to completely understand it in less than a week.</strong> In that context, your words to 9000 were completely uncalled for... I can understand why he was upset. </p>

<p>A team is like a family, and the family asshole(every family has one) has to know when to show a little bit of welcoming or he won&#39;t have a family any longer.</p>

<p>Now is not the time to be tough or unapologetic, the hard-ass uncle who tells the kids that santa clause &quot;fkn aint real&quot; --- It&#39;s the time to be the loving teacher that acts in grace and husbandry, cultivating a team so that it organically flourishes.

<p>That is all I saw... was there more to it? To be honest, I didn&#39;t think that response is characteristic of a critical response. I think we all understand that you&#39;ve been really busy defending yourself the past few days. Hell, I understand you&#39;re probably on edge. </p>

<p>9000 probably could have looked around the sub and found out all that he needed to, but the searching around was probably somewhat off-putting... You know full well that there were obstacles to really understanding the big picture of what we were doing. Looking back, I feel bad for not PMing him to disclose it all. </p>

<p>Anyway, I just think your response was unnecessarily rude. You could have just as easily asked one of us to explain it to him. Accept my criticism, man up, and apologize(not a half-ass apology) and hope that he&#39;ll accept it.  </p>

<p>He confessed to not having followed instructions, then wanted instructions. But that&#39;s <em>my fault</em>? I don&#39;t follow your logic, here, supercede. And, if you care to reread my long rant, I spoke of both him AND FCD badgering me (FCD had been badgering me in PM for a couple hours <strong>despite</strong> me asking all discussion to take place in threads in the subreddit for all to see and comment on).</p>

<p>There&#39;ll be no apology to 9000sins. Look what he did here with it. He made it into r/conspiracy subreddit drama. Wheeee. Ain&#39;t this just spiffy?</p>

<p>Just a couple pertinent questions for which he was ridiculed, belittled and then later criticized cheekily as a mod here. </p>

<p>You built that. Proud of it?</p>

<p>A man that can not admit a mistake never learns from it.</p>

<p>Nor is he a man. Yeah, I&#39;m pissed at you. You blew up something that could have been special because you didn&#39;t have time to answer questions to someone trying to assist you. In an effort to make this place better. Ego overrode common sense.</p>

<p>You were too busy fighting trolls to no effect. Again.</p>

<p>Too busy to lend a hand to a brother that needed it. I&#39;m disgusted by your selfishness.</p>

<p>Working toward giving my work to the whole world was selfishness, just because I didn&#39;t put my whole world on hold to coddle 9000sins? Interesting. I&#39;ll have to give it some thought. </p>

<p>There. I gave it some thought. And, I respectfully disagree.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So, which one are you? You must be either an admin, or one of the ones I added (foolishly) to my subreddit.</p>

<p>Show yourself. Oh, right. Nor are you a man.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT: You didn&#39;t see a tantrum? You must not have read this post. He&#39;s quitting r/conspiracy because of something that happened in MY subreddit.</p>

<p>He&#39;s quoting JCM talking about stalkers, as proof that JCM is lying about &quot;our&quot; tactics. So now, below, when he starts ranting about OP not talking about stalking, it&#39;s a little confusing. So, my point is that a single twitter post is an odd definition of stalking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> and every other subreddit is trying to game things. LOL get a grip I have a bot running that just throws whatever is on the front page to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> out there. I believe the conspiracy nuts long ago flagged my EPS and conspiratard twitter accounts making them pretty much invisible to everyone except for the paranoid stalker types. </p>

<p>Working toward giving my work to the whole world was selfishness, just because I didn&#39;t put my whole world on hold to coddle 9000sins? Interesting. I&#39;ll have to give it some thought. </p>

<p>There. I gave it some thought. And, I respectfully disagree.</p>

<p>So, which one are you? You must be either an admin, or one of the ones I added (foolishly) to my subreddit.</p>

<p>Show yourself. Oh, right. Nor are you a man.</p>
