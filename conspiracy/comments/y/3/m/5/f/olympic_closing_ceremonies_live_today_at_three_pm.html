<p>Edit: And, since there won&#39;t be any attack or event to launch off World War 3/Prison Planet/New World Order, what does it say about all these &quot;predictions&quot;? Will <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> actually use this to discredit the sources, or is the belief system just too strong?

    <div class="md"><p>Very little people from my understanding said something will happen, people just pointed out at tell-tail signs that made it suspicious and hinted at possibly something happening. </p>

<p>Then on the other hand maybe it really was exposed and they backed off, I mean who knows. I think a lot of people would have wanted millions of people exposing 9/11. </p>

<p>If you watch the youtube videos you&#39;ll see combined they have tens of millions of views, plus all the conspiracy sites, plus various forums, so we are really looking at huge exposure here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 7,000,000,000 people on the planet. If each of them predicted 5 different things a day, you&#39;d get a one-in-a-trillion correct prediction <strong><em>every lunar cycle</em></strong>.</p>

<p>-- edit</p>

<p>I have been corrected:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The probability of at least one prediction coming true out of a trillion predictions (assuming a one-in-a-trillion chance for any one coming true) is about two-thirds. Pretty good odds, but not dead certain. To break the 99% barrier, you&#39;d need something close to 5 trillion predictions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like how rolling a d6 six times will not guarantee that you roll at least one six. The odds are <em>pretty</em> good, but not great.</p>

<p>Aggregate probabilities involving distinct random events can&#39;t be calculated by simply adding up each event&#39;s probability.</p>

<p>If a result has probability P of occurring, the probability of non-occurrence is (1 - P). The aggregate probability of a series of occurrences is P<sup>n,</sup> where n is the number of consecutive occurrences. To find the probability of at least one occurrence in n samples, we simply subtract the probability of a series of n non-occurrences from 1.0. So:</p>

<p>P(aggregate) = 1 - (1 - P)<sup>n</sup></p>

<p>So the odds of rolling at least one six in 6 rolls of a d6 is 1 - ((1 - (1 / 6))<sup>6</sup> ) = 0.67, or 67%. </p>

<p>Cool, huh?</p>

<p>But either way yeah someone at home somewhere may predict something, but we are talking about something on the big stage as false flag, conflict, etc... with great accuracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who are the conspiracy theorists that said there was going to be an attack? The UK Gov put missiles on top of apartments so they thought there might be an attack...</p>

<p>But thats a conspiracy theory aswell isnt it? Gov just wants people to live in fear and beg big daddy Gov to protect them.</p>

<p>Then it really takes off with everything from aliens revelaing themselves,bluebeam HAARP etc.</p>

<p>I know the olympics are really boring but come on...its like the olympics was going to be a stage for some crazy theory to come true.</p>

<p>I wish I knew more about social psychology,Im sure this attaching your wishful thinking big event to another big event thats actually happening can be explained simply enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just did a quick reddit search of &quot;Olympics&quot;, and limited it to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Here&#39;s some of the results. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/wlm66/guys_ive_read_a_lot_about_the_2012_london/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/wlm66/guys_ive_read_a_lot_about_the_2012_london/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/xcgf8/thousands_of_empty_vip_olympic_seats_enough_to/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/xcgf8/thousands_of_empty_vip_olympic_seats_enough_to/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/w51eq/london_olympics_2012_illuminati_conspiracyis_the/">www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/w51eq/london_olympics_2012_illuminati_conspiracyis_the/</a></p>

<p>Each of these is related to a supposed &quot;attack&quot;, staged or not, at the London 2012 Olympics. There are more, but this is just what I grabbed quickly. It was a common opinion that there would be a false-flag attack, or some staged event at the Olympics. But, I&#39;m willing to bet that most of these people will back out of their claims. I don&#39;t mean to pick out <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Doing a google search expands the view. </p>

<p>When the Olympics pass without event, the conspiracy theorists that are too attached to their belief will find some loophole to extend it. Whether it&#39;s because &quot;too many people knew about it&quot;, or &quot;they just wanted to show off all the secret symbols&quot;, people will find a way to validate themselves. I can&#39;t think of the term for it but you&#39;re right, this is all deeply rooted in social psychology. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot like cult&#39;s psychology. They focus on a few key icons (like Alex Jones for example), and...shit I&#39;m getting off topic. But yes. You&#39;re absolutely right, it&#39;s Cult Psychology 101.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The empty seats were the only thing interesting to me but (without even googling!) I heard on the radio that this is easily explained because all the corporate sponsors got loads of free tickets they gave to their friends who being super rich and stuff had better things to do than watch obsessive compulsives running around and throwing things.</p>

<p>That is something that shouldnt be of course and yet again shines the spotlight on more problems with corporate sponsorship but no one is talking about that real issue becuase there might be a terror attack or aliens landing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You want me to name terrorist organisations? But why?</p>

<p>Unless you are insinuating that there are, in fact, NO terrorists in the entire world? Is that what you are saying? You are saying that there are no terrorists who would want to attack the UK, and that the anti-terror measures taken during the 2012 Olympics had some other motive? Yes or no. Are there any terrorists? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you don&#39;t seem to understand is that many of these so called &#39;terrorist&#39; organizations are in no position to even be considered as such. as stated previously, terrorism is a tactic not a group. the US, UK, and most of the other big countries are themselves being run by terrorist organizations. fighting a terrorist group does not make you a terrorist. these groups are against our governments not our people.</p>

<p>yes there are terrorists, but they are not who you say they are. at least that the conclusion ive come to. now my question for you is why the fuck are you here? why do people like you insist on coming in here and insulting us? what brings you to this subreddit? you are accomplishing nothing by coming here to tell us we&#39;re all wrong. i never thought there was going to be a false flag or even a real one at the Olympics but the fact of the matter is that there are conspiracies and alot more than we know. if you don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s fine but leave us the fuck alone.</p>

It would be continuous waves of terror, hitting everything from bridges, to hospitals, to water supplies. They would find a way. But they don&#39;t. Obviously, eleven years after 9/11 there hasn&#39;t been any actions that warrant the constant assault on our freedoms that have ensued since. They hate us for our freedoms?

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is that the conspiracy theorists WANT something to happen. It&#39;s fun to speculate, argue and debate stuff online. But, the real world is headed in a downward spiral. People are losing their jobs, infrastructure is crumbling, the economy is doing bad, things are getting more expensive and the rich are only getting richer. Basically, the world sucks. A lot of people dream about a new future. They want a pivotal moment that changes history. Some big event that sends us hurdling into the next phase. They need something BIG to happen that will cause all of the patriots to band together to fight against the current system. That is why everyone keeps wishing, hoping, and speculating. Waiting for the catalyst that will spark the next revolution. If it isn&#39;t this thing.... maybe it&#39;s the next one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy theory part is just a way to try to predict future events based on observation of random data points. The human brain loves to try to create patterns and find order within chaos. It&#39;s usually just a non sequitur.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that they want it to be an attack on the Olympics per se. It could be anything (911, Iran, WWIII, Syria, aliens, etc.). That is the nature of conspiracy theories. You look for something big.... and speculate. You spin a bunch of &quot;what if?&quot; scenarios. And you try to prepare for any outcome. If it doesn&#39;t happen, you put it behind you and move on to the next big thing and start to speculate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is really meta, and I like it. This is really insightful into the nature of conspiracy theories, and why we make them. It gets even more cemented when you have an outgroup to focus on (Jews, terrorists, foreigners, Commies). Once you get that outgroup your conspiracy theory gets even stronger. </p>

<p>I think it derives from our distinct distrust of &quot;out groups&quot;. We all belong to &quot;in groups&quot; and shun &quot;out groups&quot;. When it comes to creating a theory of who&#39;s ruling the world, it&#39;s only natural of us to choose an out group to focus our hatred. Then that cements it even further...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously not every conspiracy theory is false. History teaches us that, in which every government and group conspires against another. To say that no conspiracy theory is true would be incredibly naive. And being the watchdogs of government/society is a very, very good thing.

<p>Skipping the royalty statement, the 93 bombing of WTC, while rendered moot after 9/11, still had an effect upon those who watched it unfold. As did the attack on the Cole, the Marines in Lebanon, etc.</p>

<p>These things can and do happen. Keeping your eyes open is a good thing.</p>
