<p>It got 7 upvotes in 7 hours... Meanwhile sensational titles questioning whether we landed on the moon or faked 9/11 have garnered way more upvotes. Apparently since it wasn&#39;t an Infowars article, it&#39;s no good?  Go fuck yourselves <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. You&#39;re obviously not out there to find the truth. </p>

<p>While this is true. I&#39;d say a good third of these stories are about James Holmes&#39; father and many of the other submissions are highly sensationalized. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t about activism. This is about reminding those who are unaware of what is going on with this ongoing investigation. I got banned in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> the first time I made a Ron Paul submission. I expected <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to at least entertain the idea of the events taking place in our world... not conceal them. Look at the front page and tell me that this subreddit isn&#39;t an absolute joke. If I simply wanted to read a &quot;discussion board&quot; I would go to Above Top Secret. </p>

<p>As for your link, this community has a good understanding of Libor already (I think?), how it happened and what the implications are. You shouldn&#39;t expect too much of a response about a well-documented banking scandal unless your title is highlighting novel information from your source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bud, the most IMPORTANT conspiracies are almost always unverifiable.</p>

<p>People deserve to make their own choices in regards to what is true and what is not, verified or unverified.</p>

<p>You want too believe in Aliens from MARS Sidonia are inflicting the earth with pod people viruses?? That&#39;s your choice! Want to provide proof or no proof? That&#39;s your call!</p>

<p>ALLOW PEOPLE to make their own discernment. They don&#39;t need a chaperon...they are adults!!</p>

<p>So bring on every conspiracy from A to B. We are here to decide for ourselves. Not to have it decided already for us.</p>

<p>Your post got buried by bullshit, it happens, but if you stick around, along with me, and others, we can turn this ship around.  I feel your pain, it sucks that good content gets buried by &quot;Zionists are eating your babies!&quot;, and &quot;11 Reasons Why Rand Paul Is The Anti Christ&quot;...it really is ridiculous, but keep in mind, some folks around here like to upvote bullshit to keep the good stories buried...either for the &quot;lulz&quot; or just because they are jack knuckles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not desperate for upvotes. I&#39;m just tired of reading the same bs on this subreddit. People are saying why care about Libor? It&#39;s not a conspiracy if it&#39;s proven? What the hell is this? So we find a conspiracy with some basis, but because some people think its too complicated - they don&#39;t care. Others think that because it&#39;s proven, it&#39;s not a conspiracy - they don&#39;t care. </p>

<p>So here we are... a group of banks and bankers systematically rape the very foundation of the global economy, likely causing millions to lose their homes when they otherwise would have got to keep them and it&#39;s not important. This. This is why I&#39;m unsubscribing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not desperate for upvotes. I&#39;m just tired of reading the same bs on this subreddit. People are saying why care about Libor? It&#39;s not a conspiracy if it&#39;s proven? What the hell is this? So we find a conspiracy with some basis, but because some people think its too complicated - they don&#39;t care. Others think that because it&#39;s proven, it&#39;s not a conspiracy - they don&#39;t care. </p>

<p>So here we are... a group of banks and bankers systematically rape the very foundation of the global economy, likely causing millions to lose their homes when they otherwise would have got to keep them and it&#39;s not important. This. This is why I&#39;m unsubscribing. </p>

<p>If I wanted upvotes, <a href="http://m.quickmeme.com/meme/3qo2yl/">I would post this</a></p>
