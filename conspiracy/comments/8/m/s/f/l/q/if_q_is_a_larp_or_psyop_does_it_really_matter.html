<p>The general position seems to be &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter if he is real or a psyop because he is telling the truth&quot;. Right then and there, I disagree fundamentally, as I&#39;ve seen other people do in this sub. So the question changes in tone completely: if q is not telling the truth, then it <em>does</em> matter whether he&#39;s just some informed NEET in a basement going through a fit of anonymity grandeur, or an actual psyop by <em>them</em> in order to trick people.     </p>

<p>So basically, what really matters is whether q is telling the truth (about everything) or not.</p>

<p>This is the party line is it not?   What Christian values?  What culture is under attack?    Evangelical Christian movements through their commitment to fundamentalism are constantly undermining education and scientific understanding.  In addition the movement is largely responsible for the support of Zionism, actively doing it hoping for Armageddon. </p>

<p>Read the book recommended. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well I have an idea, try being tolerant and open minded. You will find that out that your brains can&#39;t fall out.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just look what is happening in Europe. </p>

<p>Uhm, can you be a little more specific.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although having said that, in the end religion will be used as a tool to control people as one pillar of the nwo</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Religion is a tool used to get people to identify with a political state.  It is and will be treated as the noble lie required to make the political order function.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the very essence of christianity itself will have to be broken down for that to happen.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you mean by this.  In Christianity there have always been authoritarian strands, and they are embraced by a large population in the US.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The basic tenets of christianity are the same as our constitution.</p>

<p>The end game in my opinion for the nwo is:</p>

<p>surveillance</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>These are not basic tenets of Christianity. At this point claims are just made up.   In fact, the 10 commandments contain many provisions that are in direct opposition.     They place a limitation of speech, and on worship, for a most obvious example.  The rhetoric about a creator as a guranteer of rights, comes from deism, an enlightenment philosophy, not Christianity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In India they have the caste system which is based on their religious beliefs. All cultures are based on their religious beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The causality here is reversed, religious beliefs are based on material and cultural practices.   It is why when monarchies were the dominant form of government, Christianity was used to justify it by appeals to divine rights of kings. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if you are agnostic or believe in scientism that is still a religious belief. Because no one knows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agnosticism is not a religious belief.  It is a position one takes on religious claims.   Scientism is an ideology. None are relevant to authoritarian streaks that are found in American Christian Fundamentalism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Christian faith, I believe, will be one of the biggest voices against this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why Christian?? I mean what should be obvious is that spiritual traditions in general would be advancing arguments against trans/post humanism.   </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Christianity would have any problem with mass surveillance as its tenet is already of a cosmic panopticon used to keep the plebs in line. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything, and I mean anything, can be used for good or evil.  Religion can be used to enlighten or control.</p>

<p>And every belief system ends up distorted and compromised at some point.</p>

<p>There is the Core tenet in christianity which is Love. Love your neighbor as yourself even to the point of loving your enemy.  The ten commandments help define the golden rule.  </p>

<p>So lets not throw the baby out with the bathwater. </p>

<p>Government, sadly, always ends up trying to control the people.  Even here in America, where the government was suppose to work for us.  </p>

<p>Government uses the 7 mountains to control people and religion is just one of those.</p>

<p>education</p>

<p>The arts: movies, music etc.</p>

<p>science</p>

<p>family</p>

<p>economy</p>

<p>Spirituality/religion</p>

<p>government</p>

<p>All of these are infiltrated and used to control.  And yes people, a culture, needs to organize around certain values.  The values America is organized around are christian values as reflected in our constitution and laws.</p>

<p>Have they been infiltrated and distorted by many influences:  Most definitely, Yes!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In this example, love is stripped of meaning and simply used for its connotation.  For starters love is not a tenet.   It is a word for a complex set of ideas, which include various emotional states, as well as actions and obligations towards others.  In fact it is such straining to claim any relations that using a theistic name in an institutionally unapproved way, or not worshiping on the sabbath has jack all to do with the golden rule.  </p>

<p>No one is arguing to throw out the golden rule. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Government uses the 7 mountains to control people and religion is just one of those.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You than proceed to list government as one of the &#39;7 mountains&#39;.  This is a circular argument. </p>

<p>But to  bring this thread back to the original claim which is the authoritarian strands in Chrstianity and the power that they wield, and seek to wield in the US, I suggest people read on the Dominionist strands. </p>

<p>What strikes me as the ruling ideology of the elites is that generating wealth is the same as having a good society, that those who generate the most wealth and are rich have a special place in terms of knowing what is good, i.e., they have a special epistemological position.  Incidentally, this is a viewpoint, advocated through quite a bit of Christian churches.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also the sabbath is a wisdom. God is asking that we tithe 10% of our time to contemplating our life and purpose here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look, I don&#39;t want to seem like I am a pedant, but think about what you are writing here.  Not that I disagree with a notion of free time reserved for contemplation, in fact, I think we should have more of it; and this fight for free time in the ancient world would certainly partially explain why the sabbath existed as a cultural practice. Ultimately, the sabbath, is a day from sundown to sundown, reserved for a specific form of religious practice.  That is not 10 percent of our time. </p>
