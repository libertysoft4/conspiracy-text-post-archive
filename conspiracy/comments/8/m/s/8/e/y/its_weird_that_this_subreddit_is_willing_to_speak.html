    <div class="md"><p>Nope not at all. Not at all.</p>

<p>The Israelis were &quot;given&quot; land owned by other people. It is what it is.
I&#39;m not saying Israel shouldn&#39;t exist. They deserve to exist and I&#39;d go as far as to support their occupation of their land.</p>

<p>The Israelis are continuing to encroach on Palestinian land. The settlements and the non stop isolation of the Palestinian people CAN NOT be compared to the USA protecting its long established borders.</p>

<p>You are purposely conflating the details here.</p>

<p>If Israel stayed within their originally given land... no issue. It wasn&#39;t really theirs but fuck it.</p>

<p>The only way we&#39;d be able to compare these situations would be if the US was continuously moving their border south... incrementally shorting Mexico&#39;s territory. You know this isn&#39;t happening.</p>

<p>lol... we&#39;d be on the same page if the USA was moving it&#39;s national capitol to Tijuana. I&#39;d agree with you then.</p>

<p>But as it is... you are comparing (again) long established national borders being protected from mass illegal infiltration to an ever encroaching nation on a people kept in squalor in an open air prison.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a super dumb insinuation/comparison.</p>

<p>Super fucking dumb.</p>

Fuck off with this American exceptionalism bullshit. Where do you think Zionists learned all of their tricks? Fuck, it goes back further than that, Hitler even based his genocide on the native americans. People make such a big deal about the holocaust but nobody talks about the genocide that dwarfs that shit, the one that inspired him in the first place. America is free from all faults because we&#39;re number one and we&#39;re the greatest. </p>

I&#39;m saying if you ignore that history and ignore the impact it has IN THE NOW, you are perpetuating that violence against other people. This isn&#39;t in the past.

They&#39;re escaping violence from a war on drugs that we started. Everything is linked. These aren&#39;t isolated events that aren&#39;t connected. The American Empire is the most powerful empire in the history of the planet, we&#39;ve been at war for 93% of our existence, if you ignore the history, you repeat it. </p>

<p>Zionists are for the growth of Israel through the Greater Israel Project.</p>

<p>The US simply wants to secure it&#39;s own border against illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>Comparing this to Zionism is not only ridiculous - it&#39;s a complete lie.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t conflate illegal immigrants with people who have had their land stolen out from underneath them, and continue to have it done through illegal settlements that are condemned by the UN.</p>

<p>Oh, how cute you sweet summer child.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re here for the Great American Free-for-All.  No rules, no consequences, everyone else is responsible for raising their children.</p>

<p>Drunk driving accident?  No problem!  Skip bail and buy some other stupid guerro&#39;s stolen identification.  Move towns, problem solved.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t afford the children you shouldn&#39;t have had?  No problem!  </p>

<p>Simply show up to an American hospital when it&#39;s time to deliver your next baby, and guess what, that&#39;s free too!  Don&#39;t worry about customs, just tell them you&#39;re here as a tourist!  Now your newly minted &quot;American&quot; qualifies you for lawful permanent residency, household food assistance, etc. to the benefit of <em>all</em> in the family. </p>

<p>No, they&#39;re not here to &quot;work, gain residency and become citizens.&quot;  We have a process for doing that that they believe does not apply to them.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re here to &quot;reconquer,&quot; and they&#39;re not fooling anyone but you.  Well, there&#39;s still a few rubes left, no doubt.  This is reddit, afterall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I finally realized why people here think Israel is worse than the USA even though Israel is just an evil arm OF the USA. It&#39;s because you don&#39;t want to believe YOU&#39;RE part of the richest 10% of people on the planet that oppress everyone else. It&#39;s a way to scapegoat someone else when, in reality, you&#39;re on the same side as them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of pro-Israel posts here recently,  filled with ignorant justifications for genocide. They all have the so feel to them...

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit the comments here are ridiculous!</p>

<p>If anyone commits a crime, violent or otherwise they&#39;re gonna face some kind of consequences regardless of citizenship status.</p>

<p>Simply being undocumented and trying to make a living shouldn&#39;t be the sort of thing we destroy family&#39;s and ruin lives over. Israel is conveniently outside the range of US &#39;democracy&#39;, but our own internal armed forces and for profit prison system is right under our noses and we do nothing.</p>
