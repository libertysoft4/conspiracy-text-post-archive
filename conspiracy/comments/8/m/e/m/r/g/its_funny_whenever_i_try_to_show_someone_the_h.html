    <div class="md"><p>I feel this is a little disingenuous. She went after Trump for his temperament and mental stability and he went after her for being unhealthy. Now two years later sharing a picture alleging she’s unhealthy does nothing to prove past conspiracies. Continuing to hammer away on Clinton does nothing to keep the people currently in power in check. Be vigilant my brothers and don’t be distracted by non issues like Hilary’s health. It doesn’t matter if she has aids and is dying. SHES NOT THE PRESIDENT AND HAS ZERO POWER IN OUR GOVERNMENT. </p>

<p>And I feel like you&#39;re projecting. Everyone has power to manipulate public opinion and push agendas. She and Obama and Comey, and their peanut gallery of supporters have been traveling around trying to skew public perceptions of Trump to try to limit his authority, and to attempt to give more authority to the people in power that they have ties to. I think it&#39;s fine to question this woman, her past and her current actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what has she done since Trump was inaugurated to “limit Trumps power”. I’m not a Hilary supporter so I’m not projecting. I’m trying to figure out why a large portion of the population is consumed with an elderly lady with no power? If she has power like you claim, what is it? Who is doing her dirty work? There are lots of theories about her but I’ve seen no solid evidence of it. She just appears to be a boogie man for the right. </p>
