    <div class="md"><p>I deleted my account about two years ago. On March 1st I received an email from Facebook saying that my account had been reactivated. First of all, reactivation should be impossible if my account was truly deleted after the 30 days it stated. Secondly, I did not reactivate my account.</p>

<p>I tried to log back in to see what the hell was going on, but I had to confirm my identity which it did not let me do. I received an error, if my memory serves correctly. The workaround would be me having to send Facebook a scan of an actual form of ID, which I&#39;m obviously not going to do. My friend told me that I was not visible in any searches, so I just ignored the biweekly emails from Facebook about people I may know. </p>

<p>Just now did I try logging in via mobile and was successful. Unfortunately, I had to confirm my email along with my cellphone number. This really fucking pisses me off. I am forced to give them my information, which includes location as I am not on a mobile VPN, just in order to &quot;delete&quot; my account a second time.</p>

<p>A weird part is that the people who Facebook recommended were mostly Chinese, with names written in Chinese. I am white and maybe had two Chinese people on my old friend&#39;s list however; I now work at a Chinese restaurant with several Chinese people who speak Cantonese and have Chinese Facebook friends who write in Chinese. I&#39;ve also moved cities since I first deleted my account. I have not asked my coworkers if they know anyone that Facebook is recommending me. Maybe it&#39;s a coincidence, but I find it odd that Facebook would recommend me a bunch of Chinese people when I start working at a Chinese restaurant. If my coworkers do indeed know some of the people who Facebook is recommending me, I&#39;ll be sure to create a post and let people here know. It would imply that they are constantly keeping track of your location via cellphone even while not logged in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because deactivation =/= deletion. To permanently delete your facebook you have to find a link that is not available on settings (just google: &quot;How to permanently delete facebook&quot; and you&#39;ll find it in a couple of sites). Follow the steps and wait for 14 days. After 14 days you no longer have access to your account and after 90 days everything should be deleted from their servers. I deleted mine and when I  tried to log in after the 14 days to corroborate I effectively couldn&#39;t access my account. </p>
