        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So in paris, a negligent father left his kid unattended, which somehow resulted in the kid dangling from a 4th story balcony railing. Spectators filmed a guy climbing to the 4th floor to save the child. </p>

<p>Pretty cool, right? But here&#39;s the thing: there was a guy holding the kid from across the apartment dividers. When the hero reached the kid, he lifted him over the railing with one hand. Why couldnt the guy right next to the child have done the same? It looked like he was just holding the kid until the other guy got the glory. Now the &#39;french spiderman&#39; is all over the news. The neighbor has been forgotten.</p>

<p>Turns out mamoudou is an illegal immigrant from mali. Macron meets with him on tv and grants him full french citizenship, and offers him a job with the fire department. It reeked of pro-illegal immigration propaganda. Are all people from mali just really good at scaling buildings? There was a guy right next to the kid who easily could have saved him. Maybe Im cynical but the whole thing felt staged as hell. </p>

<p>Curious to hear yall&#39;s thoughts. At first i thought &#39;damn, thats awesome&#39;, but the more i think about it, its just too perfect.its from the guardian btw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the explanation is that there was a wall between the guy and the kid. So he couldn’t walk over and lift him as easily as Spider-Man guy. </p>

<p>I’m always a dubious of stories like this, would love to take it at face value, but too many political moves have happened after he saved the kid (citizenship, offered firefighter job).. strikes me as “see not ALL illegal immigrants in France are bad!!” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a number of red flags but the most unbelievable aspect of the story (or the official narrative of it) is that the 4 year old boy was not clinging onto his own balcony railing, because his family live on the floor above. <strong>He had apparently already fallen one level and somehow managed to cling on to the balcony below!</strong> Right.</p>

<p>A lot of people in France aren&#39;t buying the story either, and the ever-helpful mainstream media has felt it necessary to &quot;debunk&quot; some of the theories. This article is in French, but your browser should be able to translate it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The very small amount of people not believing this story are far-right wingers.  If one of the other french guys had reached this kid, none of these far-right nutters would be saying shit about this story.  There were 2 other white frenchmen climbing up the fencing too.</p>

<p>Honestly I don&#39;t quite understand how this isn&#39;t a 100% believable story considering we have the entire thing on multiple phone video recording devices.  People are horrible at watching their kids.  Kids love to climb.  Kids do this thing all the time and we&#39;ve had plenty of other incidents of it happening all over the world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have Spiderman casually scaling up a building - an incredible feat in itself, and it turns he is rescuing another superhero - <strong>limpet-boy</strong> -who fell from his own balcony and miraculously caught the railing on the floor below, which he then clung on to for maybe 10 minutes whilst a huge crowd materialised below, muttering and pointing gormlessly.</p>

<p>But I get your point, sometimes a real life situation can bear an uncanny resemblance to a comic book story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, looked very staged.  The kids was standing on a lip not really dangling and could have probably been pretty comfortable like that for  quite a while, and then the guy holding him was there too just in case... yeah he was reaching around the divider but that was a little kid, and I assume not a greased watermelon... since the rescuer didn&#39;t seem to have any trouble with grip.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the one hand, the event could have realistically been staged. On the other, if I was the neighbor, I probably wouldn&#39;t risk trying to lift a child whose weight I don&#39;t know, on a weird angle, where the fall is 4 floors, and when there&#39;s a guy who clearly knows what the fuck he&#39;s doing climbing like mad over the stories. Would you have risked it when there was a guy coming to the rescue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno, depends on how quickly it all happened... if it had been longer than a minute or two before the random bystander saw and went for it, I would have probably already grabbed the kid and pulled him up yes... but lots of people in such situations will also just sort of &quot;freeze&quot; and be unsure of what to do, so yeah like I said it might have been a natural event that got exaggerated and blown out of proportion.  I could see it happening that way... but still no less silly that it had to get to the point where a guy climbed 4 stories to pull him over the railing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a difficult situation. For sure, if the child had been there for more than a couple minutes and no help in sight I would&#39;ve tried anything simply because children have little endurance, so me trying is a 50/50 but the child is guaranteed to fall eventually. However by the number of bystanders on the video, help was presumably on the way.     </p>

<p>When I first looked at the video it didn&#39;t seem suspicious, but after I learned of the Macron thing it started sounding weird alright. I don&#39;t have any evidence either way, and the situation was plausible enough, though, so I refrained from commenting on it with the conspiracy angle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah by the way I heard the guy describe it, he was going to a soccer game or something and saw a crowd gathered, so It seems like it had been an ongoing thing by the time he showed up, but its unclear.  Just saying, I would&#39;ve just pulled him up.  I&#39;ve had kids, I know they aren&#39;t heavy and I&#39;d rather risk a dislocated shoulder than a dead kid.</p>

<p>The neighbor got on his balcony around 26 seconds in. You can see he was guiding the kid towards him. At 46 seconds french spiderman had reached the balcony and hoisted the kid up. So approximately 20 seconds for the neighbor. It does look like the neighbor was going to save the kid anyways, however french spiderman had started climbing and was half way up when thevneighbor showed up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have the video evidence and the statements by Macron vs OP who thinks this is a convenient ploy to build up immigrant sympathy. Reading it again, it seems OP finds it more likely that the government intentionally placed the life of a child in danger in order get a “media moment” than the possibility that this man would climb a couple of stories to save a child in danger. Is it possible that OP’s theory is correct? Sure, but it would require the mobilization of a lot of resources for what appears to be a dubious payoff as OP assumes that the French are going to suddenly welcome illegal immigrants in with open arms. If this was the government’s intention and they are willing to break laws to achieve it we could easily imagine dozens of scenarios more likely to succeed in achieving that goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Getting everyone to love illegal immigration and think its a great thing... when in reality they are driving low wage labor even lower and eroding benefits and workers rights for lower classes.  Some of them are quite educated and take professional jobs too but much smaller numbers.  When you think about it most of the arguments for illegal immigration and why it is so &quot;critical&quot; sound and awful lot like the reasons why slave owners fought for slavery in the civil war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because if they weren&#39;t streaming in flooding certain low wage categories with virtual slave labor then multiple things would happen.</p>

<p>1) Said jobs over time would gradually become higher paying and/or have better benefits because of being performed by citizens protected by labor laws.</p>

<p>2) Other countries would have to deal with their own problems instead of just encouraging people to go and be someone else&#39;s problem.  A lot of these people are highly motivated and entrepreneurial... it would improve conditions in other parts of the world if those people stayed and built things there.... we should be pursing trade policies that improve worker rights and elevate other countries standard of living, then there wouldn&#39;t be such and imbalance like we see now.  There is a lot more to be said, but the chances of oligarchy making such changes are basically zero if they aren&#39;t forced to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, because the source of the problem is in the generation and protection of profits, it would simply move the problem around. There would be fewer minimum wage jobs, more automation and more exporting of jobs overseas. Surpluses must be protected. That said, I&#39;m totally with you on improved policies that protect worker rights internationally and generate better conditions... sadly, that doesn&#39;t cut a profit for elites. Again, that&#39;s where the rage should be directed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah thats why I said its almost moot since they&#39;ll never changed if not forced.  If you only fix half the issue then it would be &quot;whack-a-mole&quot; like you said, but ultimately they need to do both stop illegal immigration (so other countries have incentive to actually get on board with proposed changes) and then also actually make the trade policy changes.  One won&#39;t work without the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people would be more united on this issue if people didn&#39;t incorrectly assume anti-immigration = far right bullshit. I&#39;m economically center left and non-authoritarian socially. I only (temporarily) tolerate mass immigration (for compassion reasons) but it&#39;s still artificially pushed by the root causes: war (NEOcon shit), globalist corporate jobs outsourcing and transnational corporations corrupting leaders in poorer countries (NEOliberal/far right economic corporatist shit).</p>

<p>Artificial mass immigration indirectly drives wages down due to workers competing for shit wages (immigrants from poor countries willing to work for even shittier wages than U.S./UK/EU type wages).</p>

<p>If people were awake about this, we could attack the root causes which would be an absolutely win-win situation for everyone except the corporatist globalists (NEOlibs/NEOcons like Bush/Obama/Clinton/Reagan/Macron/ etc. etc.).</p>

<p>I&#39;m against shitting on immigrants for no reason but also against the artificial push for mass immigration. Cut the root causes and mass immigration would be a thing of the past, benefiting everyone but the asshole elites who want fascist world slavery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah friend, it&#39;s probably the fault of identity politics or something pushed by the corporate media. Over-simplified pre-packaged reactionary opposing models of thought. Extreme in one way vs extreme in another way. Some debates are socially engineered to have a dead end using misunderstandings and strawman arguments on &quot;either side&quot; of the argument (plus there are usually much more than two sides).</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the edgy people who think &quot;political correctness&quot; is the reason the world is turning to shit (highly exaggerated distraction compared to actual corruption/actual policies for example) VS the people who blindly defend extreme political correctness (which could become a slippery slope to less free speech). 
I&#39;d assume most people are inherently somewhere in between like.....sensitive and polite while still telling it like they see it. A balanced approach.</p>

<p>Everyone&#39;s ignorant sometimes, we just have to listen to different ideas and see what makes sense in a calm way. Lots of people jump to weird conclusions with strange anger. I think most people do actually have most things in common (desires and needs) but their common sense has been compromised by the manipulation of identity politics. It could be other factors I&#39;m unaware of too, this is just the one I know of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read up on the Paneuropean Union. The organization that would eventually become the EU. In particular, learn about its founders and their vision for Europe. Current EU immigration law was planned over 90 years ago and every few years an award is given to a European politician who best furthers the PEU&#39;s plans for future Europe. The founding fathers of the EU were nobility. Oooooold money. If you want to hear it straight from the horses mouth, find an English translation of &quot;Practical Idealism&quot; by Count Richard Von Coudenhove-Kalergi. The plan was to be implemented in phases and is essentially:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Coercion of European states into a union much like the US (EU)</p></li>
<li><p>Free movement of people among member states (Schengen Area), eventual elimination of national boundaries</p></li>
<li><p>Mass transfer of peoples of Africa and the Near East into Europe (&quot;refugee crisis&quot;)</p></li>
<li><p>With the aid of new anti-discrimination laws and mass propaganda efforts, large-scale interbreeding and intermarrying with non-Europeans occurs until native Europeans are, as PEU founder Coudenhove-Kalergi put it, &quot;similar in appearance to ancient Egyptians&quot;. He also stated that one particular group will not mix and will become Europes new ruling class.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And this was planned almost 100 years ago. The EU is anti-European, just as its founders were. People like Freemason Coudenhove-Kalergi, who himself was of mixed race, had a resentment of European nation-states. If you want to read all of this this for yourself, a quick google search brings back tons of verifiable information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All and especially US people and asian people there,</p>

<p>The post here is relevant, but it needs some clarifications about the current status of EU.</p>

<p>Here, all mainstream medias are sponsoring immigration actively. When a name has a foreign origin, it is often hidden in newspaper when associated with a malevolent act for instance. All politics against immigration are named &quot;populist&quot;, which is a highly pejorative name here.</p>

<p>Following the election of far-right (or far-left) movements in several European countries, we have seen several acts against these countries, a bit like economic sanctions. See what happens in Italy currently: Italy is the third economy in the euro-zone, they elected people against EU, and they are now in a big crisis, the president refusing to accept this elected government. It happens only three times in their full history. </p>

<p>&quot;Populist&quot; movements are increasing everywhere there. And yes, current politics are ready to use all means to keep their power and to make sure that their ideas are accepted by people. Immigration is one of these ideas.</p>

<p>But honnestly, nobody understand why they support so much immigration, despite the majority is against. Some people believe it is Soros, other the US gov to keep their control of EU or to destroy it, there are many theories about that, but we cannot be sure of anything.</p>

<p>So, the question posted here is important, and we should never understimate how patient they are to build the opinion. Everything is in the details, and this is one of them.</p>

<p>We should look after proofs and expertise. Intuitively, this video and associated narrative has something which is very very strange. This is a call to experts and investigators. </p>

<p>Keep in mind two very recent facts while watching this video:</p>

<ul>
<li>Italy events</li>
<li>UK events (Tommy Robinson)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is like we are currently seeing a kind of next step in the manipulation of people / dictatorship. They do not hide anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This photo shows two things of interest:</p>

<p>1) There is a setback of perhaps 10cm between the partition and the balcony.
2) The balcony fence and railing are continuous between apartments.</p>

<p>The child was on the outside of the fence. So there would have been no need for the neighbor to hoist the child above the fence or pull the child around the partition; he could have just pulled the child along the railing, in to his balcony, then pulled him over his fence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all an attack on individual nations. The ones in control wabt people even spread out aroubd the world so that countrues are meanibgless and they will have world domination. France is an old nation with a rich culture and it is losing it every day. The Chinese are some of the best at resisting and maintaining their culture and country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first of all, he was an illegal migrant. Try and go to a foreign country without a visa. Even a &quot;democratic&quot; country such as the USA or Canada. See what happens. In countries like China and Thailand, you will be treated like you are worth less than shit.</p>

<p>He was staying in the country illegally, so he should be sent back, end of the story.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is indeed a bit strange that the other guy could not help. If you see the video, mamadou pulls the boy by the arm the same way the other man could have pulled the boy.</p>

<p>Now, if we assume it was genuine, he certainly deserved some reward, but : a job, a French passport, appearing on all TV channels, and meeting personally the president ? Come on. Are you kidding me. It&#39;s difficult not see a political motive behind. There are lots of such heroes, they save kittens and people in danger everyday. They make the front page of the local press, if they are even heard of, and that&#39;s how far it goes.</p>

<p>Last thing, this political stunt is dumb and reckless IMO. It sends out a message that as an illegal migrant, all you have to do is save an endangered child to have all your problems solved. If I was another illegal mamadou, together with a mate video recording it all, I would totally stage a similar situation, endangering the life of a child for real this time.</p>

<p>But hey, when you play with people&#39;s emotions (&quot;look at how this poor immigrant from Mali risked his life to save a little defenseless child who was about to die!&quot;) to send a political message, it does work. It&#39;s well-known. When NGOs ask you to donate, what do they show on their ads ? Do they show a map/table of how much they have achieved so far with generous donators&#39; money ? Or do they show a sad little black boy sitting naked in the dirt and crying ?</p>
