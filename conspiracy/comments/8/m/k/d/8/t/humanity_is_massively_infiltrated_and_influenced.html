    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely do not deny the dark and corrupt potential of any living thing. Obviously there are some very twisted people out there.</p>

<p>Serious question: Do you believe we humans are bred and born to kill, conquer, destroy and dominate? A bunch of naked monkeys don&#39;t seem very intimidating in my eyes. We need clothing and tools just to survive, let alone dominate anything. Never forget that.</p>

<p>Think about natural wildlife- there are species that thrive on predation and domination and fear. They live because we fear them. A snake or a spider can move much quicker than you or I, they can hide extremely well, and many of them can easily kill an adult human. Some creatures just naturally have a greater capacity for stealth, killling, predation, etc. </p>

<p>Yes, humans can obviously be evil. But that&#39;s not how we&#39;ve survived, evolved, and lived through thousands of years. It&#39;s just not our way of life. </p>

<p>Imagine belonging to a species that&#39;s designed to hunt, kill, and dominate. Now fast forward thousands if not hundreds of thousands of years. Or more. Now your species has developed space travel and eventually comes to Earth. Do you think such a race is going to see us as anything but a source of labor and/or food?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by &#39;completely negative&#39;? Not like I&#39;m out raping, killing people and kicking puppies but I DO think negatively. I&#39;m sure I&#39;d be labeled negative for realizing evil is stronger than good. Always has been and always will be.</p>

<p>I have no use for the mumbo jumbo of anything that&#39;s supposedly &#39;over&#39; me as an authority figure. Maybe that&#39;s actually on the up and up, I just don&#39;t trust it. That bridge got burned a long time ago. I do want my freedom. I&#39;m just not willing to trust anything outside of myself to get there. Look, I don&#39;t mean to be a bitch.

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately lot of new age people are phony self-serving egotistical hypocrites and all these sentiments are just another trend for them. I&#39;m sorry for this person. </p>

<p>It&#39;s wise to be skeptical of all us weirdos, especially in this era of BS coming from all angles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I once watched a person&#39;s pupils shift into slits and back into circles right in front of my face. This stuff isn&#39;t being made up by all of us who have actually seen it (and aren&#39;t schizo). It&#39;s real.</p>

<p>I&#39;m truly sorry about your mom. Believe me, I&#39;ve had intensely serious struggles with my mom as well. I actually question her humanity... What is it about crazy moms these days? It&#39;s like half of the mothers I know are manipulative, bad people... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are just devils/fallen angels.  Outer space is just a hoax.  Lizard aliens don&#39;t exist.  If you continue practicing witchcraft (now called new age) you will eventually be tormented by these things.  When that inevitably happens simply rebuke them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and see what happens.  If you want to have some fun, try asking your higher self to &quot;reveal who you truly are in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; and see how it reacts.</p>

<p>God is sovereign and came in the flesh of Jesus Christ and died for your sins.</p>

<p>Repent and believe this to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>
