        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I am sick and tired of this very specific conversation:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;pizzagate is real&quot;<br/></li>
<li>&quot;oh so you think Hillary raped and tortured countless children in a pizzaplace in Washington DC? Yeah sure man&quot; </li>
</ul>

<p>NO. For fucks sake, no one ever said that in the first place, and no one actually believes this kind a statement at all. &quot;The Washington Post mentioned that in their article once news about pizzagate broke free, and that&#39;s when all this stuff began to become badmouthed as a conspiracy shit. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s get the facts straight:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the Podesta Mails, some anons found weird wordings and phrases. These phrases were said to be code for pedophiles, which could most likely be fake. HOWEVER:</li>
<li>These mails mentioned Comet Ping Pong as a place, where one could meet up. This made a few anons study this very specific pizza place. </li>
<li>They found the owner of this very specific pizza place, James Alefantis, to have been posting some rather <strong>weird pictures</strong> of children.</li>
<li>Some of them were taped to a table, and didn&#39;t look too happy</li>
<li>Some pics of babies were titled as &quot;whore&quot; </li>
<li>Some other weird pics from that instagram page raised a few anons eyebrow. </li>
<li>an allegedly leaked FBI document of pedophile symbols did lead to a inspection of the symbols of each shop around that pizza place, after these very symbols were found within the logo and menu of comet ping pong. </li>
<li><strong>wether these symbols are real or not, doesn&#39;t matter for this place to at least having had left a weird impression on the anons doing the research</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>-Satanic symbols were found in a room within comet ping-pong and the logo, too. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The &quot;Finders&quot;, &quot;Dutroux Affair&quot; alongside the &quot;Franklin Coverup&quot; came to the mind of anons. All these cases were <strong>proven to be an appearance in the past of pedophilia connected to satanism and politicians or at least elitist members of the society</strong></p></li>
<li><p>*<em>Any further research from this point should have not been discredited in the way we actually have seen it been to. *</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>TL;DR: pizzagate is not about Hillary raping children in a basement of a pizzaplace, but this very specific pizza place was found to be lead by a person that posted photos of children in relation to sexual meanings, as well as photos of children that didn&#39;t look very comfortable taped on a table. While one can argue about the symbolism, these facts alone should have legalized any further research without any doubt, as this is an absolutely improper behavior towards minors. </p>

<p>Thank you for the read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that’s what you want everyone to believe but that is simply not the case. I want to also mention that James Alefantis is not on the up and up. Here we have a man who was pronounced the 49th most powerful man in Washington DC by GQ magazine. His occupation? Pizza restaurant owner, and for most of the week the kitchen is open for 4 hours a day. Now let’s say you think there is nothing wrong with his disgusting instagram posts. Fine. However, there was found to be a <a href="https://youtu.be/TnW7OT6Dkuw">protected section on the Comet Ping Pong website</a>. What was on that protected section? According to Titus Frost (real name Dean Fougere) and the hacker Bigfish, there was “Cheese Pizza” aka Child Pornography on that website. <a href="https://youtu.be/HTRewHDOr90">In this video, you can see the e-mails that we’re sent to the Washington DC police department officer Marcus Stevens, and he shows that Officer Marcus Stevens confirmed receipt of the e-mail as well.</a> And to the naysayers who will inevitably come out of the woodwork to say that there is no real proof to what I am saying and that the e-mails could have been fabricated, as could evidence of the protected section of the Comet Ping Pong website, I would like to remind you that falsely accusing someone of possessing and distributing child pornography is an extremely serious crime which would almost certainly result in jail time if James Alefantis were to persue a lawsuit against Dean Fougere andthr hacker Bigfish, so if you honestly think that these men would risk their freedom by making up this whole story in order to get more views on their YouTube video or whatever motive you can come up with, you’re out of your mind.</p>

<p>Proof?</p>

<p>Below is the incident report made avaliable after contacting the DC police.</p>

<p>What&#39;s this have to do with anything <a href="/u/GoddamnFreemasons">/u/GoddamnFreemasons</a> just wrote?</p>

<p>It certainly looks like you just put a bunch of links in there to give the <em>appearance</em> of sourcing your claims, when really your references are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>A post from 4chan (ironically enough) </p></li>
<li><p>A web archive to the password protected page itself (which doesn&#39;t show menus of any kind) </p></li>
</ol>

<p>3 and 4. The incident report from when the kid went in with an AR to &quot;investigate&quot;... which is 100% irrelevant to the comment you replied to.</p>

<p>The proof for Titus... Well that&#39;s more esoteric but if you&#39;ve been around the conspiracy community you may be aware.</p>

<p>I linked the police report because parent linked to a video talking about speaking to an officer in DC. Yes that happened but the only files released had nothing to do with pedophillia just the comet shooter which is the only crime with any evidence that&#39;s occurred at comet. </p>

<p>All that shows is they had a password protected area of the site. Where&#39;s the <strong>proof</strong> that it was just menus?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been around this community for quite some time. Are you trying to present some blogger making completely unverified and unsubstantiated claims as &quot;proof&quot; of someone lying?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, that has absolutely nothing to do with the video posted by <a href="/u/GoddamnFreemasons">/u/GoddamnFreemasons</a>. The video shows the email correspondence of the evidence from the password protected section being submitted to Officer Stevens. The fact that you&#39;re trying to link the unrelated police report of a separate incident is suspicious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I linked 4chan because a user there in the original investigation thread identified the password protected area as a normal Web template.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sooooo... your proof is literally &quot;this random person on 4chan said so&quot;?</p>

<p>I find it both ironic and troubling that everyone seems to say there&#39;s &quot;no evidence for p-gate&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s all from random people on 4chan, no actual evidence!&quot; when that&#39;s completely untrue... meanwhile, you&#39;re &quot;evidence&quot; for it being fake is based on literally the <strong>opinions</strong> of a random blogger, and a random 4chan poster, with no real evidence whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy... you said the P word. Prepare for mass downvotes in a couple of hours (ya know, once <em>they</em> make it into the office)</p>

<p>Another hilarious tactic that you’ll constantly see, is they’ll use the kid who went in to CPP and “shot it up” (aka shot 1 bullet through a hard drive) as justification for not wanting to discuss the idea any further because “look what it made someone do to this poor innocent pizza shop owner! These people are insane!”</p>

<p>Then if you try to bring up the suspicious moving of traffic cams just before the shooting, or the shooters weird family government connections, they’ll just stop responding to you, but the downvotes will keep coming.</p>

<p>Good post. Very interested to see how this thread will play out (don’t have very high hopes for you though). </p>

<p>I was going to point that part out too, but I had trouble finding any proof that it was moved back a day or two after the shooting to back up my claim. And when you look at the camera now, it&#39;s aimed in a completely different direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many people that think the abuse could be taking place underground. This is due to the multiple Comet Ping Pong Instagram pictures where construction is being down to the floors. They&#39;re digging into the floors. Also when I&#39;m not on mobile I&#39;m going to link a document where the owner of DuPont underground personally thanks James Alefantis for helping him with a project. I believe he also thanks Dr. Pong who is related to Pizzagate via Berlin. </p>

<p>Also again, when I&#39;m not on mobile, I&#39;m posting the 2007 video by Frank Winstead where a child can he heard yelling for help. The sound is coming from Comet Ping Pong.

    <div class="md"><p>The first few days after the CPP instagram page was introduced to 4chan there were theories discussed regarding tunnels stemming from a couple of the posts of basement renovations (#killroom) and a YouTube video that a random guy had uploaded years prior that sounded like a child yelling for help from under the street outside CPP.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting how in the early posts there was also discussion of these underground WiFi hotpots in Hawaii that were somehow related and how selling art was used to launder money - now it transpires some shady guys around Trump broke the world record buying art as if it were the most brazen money laundering in history.</p>

<p>The guy who bought the painting also bought property off Trump at much higher than market value. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously have no clue how the law works if you think those flimsy connections you made somehow are enough for a police force to go in a privately owned business and sweep the place for pedophilia. Let&#39;s not act like pizzagate didn&#39;t start with the handkerchief with a picture of a pizza and an email talking a playing dominoes high on cheese. Both of those were taking from the hacks of Jon Podesta email accounts. Then 4chan in true neckbeard fashion took all context out of those statements said the cheese and pizza he&#39;s referring to are code words for pedophilia and a bunch of ignorant right wingers believed it and a bunch of malicius right wingers saw it as an opportunity to paint the then dem presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, as a either a pedophile or knowingly works to get them children </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an old comment I saved about it. </p>

<p>This was a blog of cute baby pictures with a few videos. Tamera Luzzatto did not run the blog, Evie&#39;s father did.</p>

<p>The blog was not invite-only until internet stalkers started harassing the Luzzattos. </p>

<p>There is a little bit archived here: <a href="http://archive.is/3nW3z">http://archive.is/3nW3z</a></p>

<p>There were more pictures archived on sli.mg but that site has been down since mid-January.</p>

<p>As you can see, there&#39;s nothing unusual about the photos <em>at all</em>. </p>

<p>Also, the father tries to make humorous remarks on nearly every picture. People are trying to insinuate that there&#39;s something sinister about the phrase &quot;raw and uncut&quot;, but that&#39;s just the way he writes. </p>

<p>EDIT: Well, after looking at the header on the archive.is page, I figured out there are more pages archived.</p>

<p>Here is the biggest group of pictures: <a href="https://archive.is/2g30Y">https://archive.is/2g30Y</a></p>

<p>As you can see, there&#39;s nothing suspicious about <em>any</em> of the pictures.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://archive.is/8PZDn">here is the first post on the blog:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is where the magic happens!</p>

<p>Welcome! If you are here you are one of the first people to view Evie&#39;s blog! And our friends should thank us---by indulging ourselves with this web portal we are NOT filling your inboxes with large files of pictures and videos! </p>

<p>Enjoy and we will look forward to your comments....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="https://archive.is/Gm498">another one from that day:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evie&#39;s first day</p>

<p>Here is Dad the night I was born. Very glad he didn&#39;t make it through Organic Chemistry to become a doctor, this site doesn&#39;t inspire confidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it is the father who made the site.</p>

<p>Labeling pizzagate as &quot;hillary clinton raped and murdered kids in a dc pizza parlor&quot; is simply a damage control tactic.    </p>

<p>The FBI symbols is not alleged. You can view the document on the FBI website. It is a fact that pedos use those symbols to communicated to other pedos. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In the Podesta Mails, some anons found weird wordings and phrases. These phrases were said to be code for pedophiles, which could most likely be fake. HOWEVER:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a bit vague. If you actually look at the emails such as the handkerchief email or the outdoor pool email John Podesta doesn&#39;t use any of the alleged code. The words are used by a real estate agent and Susan Sandler, a family friend. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>These mails mentioned Comet Ping Pong as a place, where one could meet up. This made a few anons study this very specific pizza place. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you cite this email? Podesta and Alefantis held a few publicity events at Comet to raise money for the dem campaign. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They found the owner of this very specific pizza place, James Alefantis, to have been posting some rather <strong>weird pictures</strong> of children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your opinion they&#39;re weird. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of them were taped to a table, and didn&#39;t look too happy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One picture has James God daughter jokingly taped to a table, in the middle of the restaurant, while customers are around. And she&#39;s smiling. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some pics of babies were titled as &quot;whore&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they weren&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some other weird pics from that instagram page raised a few anons eyebrow. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? Raised eyebrows about a public instagram post aren&#39;t evidence someone is a pedophile. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>an allegedly leaked FBI document of pedophile symbols did lead to a inspection of the symbols of each shop around that pizza place, after these very symbols were found within the logo and menu of comet ping pong. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FBI symbols were not part of the comet logo although there may have been a spiral on the menu somewhere. Spirals are a very common shape. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>wether these symbols are real or not, doesn&#39;t matter for this place to at least having had left a weird impression on the anons doing the research</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s fine but once again a weird feeling because of a shape on a pizza menu isn&#39;t evidence Alefantis is a pedophile. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Satanic symbols were found in a room within comet ping-pong and the logo, too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is a satanic symbol and where do they appear exactly? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;Finders&quot;, &quot;Dutroux Affair&quot; alongside the &quot;Franklin Coverup&quot; came to the mind of anons. All these cases were <strong>proven to be an appearance in the past of pedophilia connected to satanism and politicians or at least elitist members of the society</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These cases have nothing to do with pizzagate except to try and convince casual observers there is something there. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>*<em>Any further research from this point should have not been discredited in the way we actually have seen it been to. *</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What research? You haven&#39;t identified one victim in almost 2 years of investigation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: pizzagate is not about Hillary raping children in a basement of a pizzaplace, but this very specific pizza place was found to be lead by a person that posted photos of children in relation to sexual meanings</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not true and a gross misrepresentation of what James Alefantis posted on instagram. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>, as well as photos of children that didn&#39;t look very comfortable taped on a table. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 child, smiling, loosely taped to a table in a public place. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While one can argue about the symbolism, these facts alone should have legalized any further research without any doubt, as this is an absolutely improper behavior towards minors. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What facts? Nothing you have posted is evidence much less evidence of a pedophile ring. </p>

<p>The problem with pizzagate is it starts at the end (child abuse happens) then tries to insert these various innocuous details the paint this evil picture. </p>

<p>Pizzagate was an organised political smear campaign - that&#39;s the real conspiracy. </p>

<p>Where I come from playing with kids is popular. James didn&#39;t call a child hotard, his friend in the comments on instagram used the hashtag hotard and then James used it back in another comment. So he was talking to his friend, regardless leaving such a comment isn&#39;t evidence of pedophillia. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the pictures were weird at all. He made his account private because he was being harrased by hundreds of strangers. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I already stated, wether these symbols are accurate or not doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>Then they can be dismissed as evidence. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many times I can say this but your pearl clutching &quot;these are weird photos&quot; is not evidence James Alefantis is a pedophile. </p>

<p>Ok I have discounted the symbolism as you say it is meaningless. What occultism do you associate with Alefantis? By all accounts he&#39;s a successful business owner and nothing more. </p>

<p>Expect there&#39;s no evidence he&#39;s ever abused a child and you just said the symbolism doesn&#39;t matter because it could just be random. </p>

<p>The Franklin scandal was pushed by a guy trying to sell a book </p>

<p>Dutroux was found guilty of two murders. That&#39;s it. Yes he was a pedophile but there is no evidence of a ring, other than that provided by the accused himself who would have plenty to gain by implicating others. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pizzagate in the very beginning was very real and got discredited over the time to a conspiracy theory of Hillary eating children and raping them. </p>

<p>What do you mean it was very real in the beginning? It was no more real then than it is now. </p>

<p>The image from a message board claiming pizza parlours are used by pedophiles is just that - a post by a random on a message board. It&#39;s not evidence James is a pedophile, as you say.</p>

<p>It says Chicken Lover? Which means <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Chicken%20Lover">this</a> or <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chicken%20lover">this</a></p>

Your right, I must&#39;ve grabbed the wrong link. But while we are on the topic of instagram, why is/was James&#39; profile pic Antinous? That&#39;s odd behavior like yours. </p>

<p>The image from a message board claiming pizza parlours are used by pedophiles is just that - a post by a random on a message board. It&#39;s not evidence James is a pedophile, as you say.</p>

<p>What does this Robertson guys arrest have to do with James? Guilt by association? That&#39;s not convincing me that James is a pedophile.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you understand. We aren&#39;t here giving proof that James is a pedophile. We are pointing out things that are weird. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it&#39;s probably a duck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually that absolutely deserves attention. It was a deliberate choice that the Disney animators or whoever greenlighted that idea had to make. Disney has inserted a lot of other hidden sexual messages into their movies in the past as well. I think you are in denial about all of this. To not be able to see any kind of pattern when you clearly know about many of the examples of these sorts of things which are getting people riled up. But you seem to be very passionate about explaining everything away and telling everyone that they are crazy for thinking it’s a conspiracy and that there is really nothing to see here.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m from Belgium and trust me on this , the Dutroux affair wasn&#39;t properly investigated at all. Many, many people will tell you the whole thing stinks to high hell. </p>

<p>For example, 27 people that were supposed to testify on this network or that had information pointing in that direction ended up dead before they could get in front of an officer or judge, the judge that got the case first decided to go on a vacation and failed to pass along the case, causing the missing girls to be found weeks later than necessary, some cops burnt a box of videos found at Dutroux&#39;s place before they could be used in court because &quot;we watched them and there wasn&#39;t anything on them&quot;, judges and prosecutors were shuffled around and some failed to act competently seemingly on purpose, Dutroux&#39;s escape, the first prosecutor of the case fully believed in the network theory and today still argues that there was much more that his predecessor failed to look into. The guy that replaced him was a rookie btw, it was his first case. Look into it man, the Dutroux affair might&#39;ve been exactly what Dutroux himself claims it is.</p>

<p>We even changed our entire police system and passed some major reforms because the people had lost all faith in our justice system. Plenty of people still remember.</p>

I’ve never EVER seen such an effort from shills to discredit this theory.   Not even for the craziest conspiracies.  Not even for stuff like 9/11.

<p>There are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/baby/">lots of images of children on instagram</a> of course they&#39;re not random, and the ones James posted are known to him and his friends too. </p>

<p>You talk about James calling a baby a slut but that is fabricated. Can you source it? </p>

<p>I am not a shill and your rapid descent to personal attacks only serves to show how flimsy your premise is. It can&#39;t be defended logically so you must go on the attack. It won&#39;t work on me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i typed out a whole thing and deleted it because it&#39;s not worth it.  the downvotes, the shills, the defensive comments, i&#39;m tired of it.  i&#39;ve been arguing with pedo sympathisers since this whole thing started.  i&#39;m really tired of it tbh.  the same arguments over and over again because people are too thick to realise what&#39;s normal and what&#39;s not.  you are defending a pedophile and ultimately you will have to answer to that someday. </p>

<p>now you will comment back saying something sarcastic about me not following up or just pick apart my argument comment by comment again.  how sad.  </p>

<p>you&#39;ve won, honestly.  you&#39;re right.  i&#39;ve changed my mind about the whole thing.  there&#39;s nothing shady about james alefantis or his friends at all.  hrc.  john podesta.  they are all fine.  nothing means anything.  we were all just bored.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about winning, it&#39;s about the truth. You believe these people (who?) are pedophiles when no one has presented evidence they are. </p>

<p>How many children do you think the pizzagate investigation has protected? I&#39;d say zero. This time could have been spent actually protecting some of the thousands of trafficked children in the US, alas here we are discussing 5 year old emails about handkerchiefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is about a lot more than that pizza shop. Its about the very real evidence that exists that implicates people in positions of power. Elites, politicians, etc. In the practice of satanice ritual abuse and pedophilia. This is a very real thing regardless of what you think of pizzagate. So maybe pizzagate is a psyop, to group all these other theories into the same crazy box. But once you become more familiar with the subject its really hard to completely dismiss. And spending your time trying to debunk such theories in the manner you are is not only futile but counterproductive. If you truly have an interest in debunking the heart of these theories heres some places to start. Heres the first BBC documentary Conspiracy of Silence, which was pulled by unknown forces days before it aired in 94. Lucky for humanity a copy was leaked out. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBSIDQt5Dwc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBSIDQt5Dwc</a> You could call this next one the sequel. They both deal with unbelievable corruption in very high places. Satanic Ritual Abuse. And pedophile raquets in very high places. Might make you think before you dismiss these other theories so easily. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N88AqwWK5M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N88AqwWK5M</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on your side! Like you said, it may all be circumstantial, but people have to admit that it is all very odd and suspicious.</p>

<p>Okay, if any of my friends were posting pictures of children duct taped on their instagram or other social media, I would be a little alarmed and concerned. Very odd to me.</p>

<p>Also, all the art in my home is quite normal and tame. All pictures of either &quot;horse racing scenes&quot; (husband loves horse racing), landscape pictures with flowers, and some art of local buildings/scenery by a local artist. All very normal to me.</p>

<p>All of my friends have normal art in their homes too. If I ever went to somebody&#39;s house or office and they had the art that the Podesta&#39;s have, I wouldn&#39;t go back to their house. I also wouldn&#39;t be friends with them. I would distance myself from them.</p>

<p>Also, that website with the &quot;raw and uncut&quot; footage is very weird and not normal.</p>

However there was a shop called Besta Pizza a few stores down that used the symbol. All Comet Ping Pong had was some strange and eccentric artwork and the instagram pictures of the owner you referred to. It should Also be noted thst Tony Podesta had a home magazine take pictures inside his Kalorama Heights mansion in D.C. There were some very violent and disturbing images on the walls and sculptures aswell as children dolls around his and his wife&#39;s bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh so you think pizzagate is literally Hillary raping and eating babies at Comet Ping Pong?&quot;</p>

<p>No, pizzagate is bullshit because it&#39;s entirely based on the willingness to believe. The theory was born because people were so desperate to find something wrong in those emails they decided that &quot;eating pizza&quot; means &quot;fucking children&quot;</p>

<p>Not to mention that there are pizzagaters who think Hillary and others performed satanic human sacrifices at Comet Ping Pong and other locations.</p>

<p>This &quot;actually pizzagate isn&#39;t Hillary raping babies in a pizza parlor basement&quot; argument is so transparent, it doesn&#39;t make the theory less ridiculous it just says the ridiculous elements don&#39;t piece together in that exact way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most basic thing that can be agreed upon is that child sex rings are thriving and they need to be stopped. after that one begins to question the validity of the the path they have taken to fight this evil. In the example of Pizzagate, for some, the evidence is proficient to accuse. For others it is not. Because of this, the question arises: &quot;when do our efforts to expose and incriminate predatory sex offenders actually hinder our ability to do so?&quot; Of course chasing empty leads is wasted time, which could have been spent actually exposing child sex rings. Yet, one of the greatest moments of shame in the pursuit of Justice is when an abandoned lead actually lead somewhere, and if only you had kept pushing you would have found what you were looking for. Equally so for false accusations... anywho, I&#39;m excited to be able to participate in the conversation. </p>

<p>Lets not forget a couple more eyebrow raisers:</p>

<p>-the likely false flag attack on cpp to play them as the victims in the media and further discredit our tireless investigative findings</p>

<p>-the media in general bad mouthing pizzagate truthers </p>

<p>-reddit closing down the now defunct r/pizzagate and forcing the conversation to continue over on voat </p>

<p>-Alefantis and associates made many bizarre posts including showing what appears to be a kill room, and references to satanic worship</p>

<p>-the neighborhood that pizzagate happens to be. Estimated 90% of govt (CIA employees)</p>

<p>-the &quot;artwork&quot; displayed in cpp and flyers for &quot;all ages shows&quot; hosted there. Wholesome acts such as &quot;the sex stains&quot;</p>

<p>-alefantis connections with the Democrats and Obama whitehouse/visits to the whitehouse </p>

<p>-the audio/video that surfaced on that strange website that appeared to feature that worm Podesta (skippy) saying &quot;say my name&quot; repeatedly to a victim</p>

She sounds either transgender or like a gay man which leads many to believe it is actually JA under the mask and wig.<br/>
Seriously, look at their website. Watch their videos, where majestic ape speaks of Jared Fogle being a regular &quot;down there&quot; and when the crowd shouts that he likes kids, &quot;We all have preferences!! teehee!!&quot; ... There is a lot of disturbing innuendo used and a lot of it is pretty blatant but also cryptic enough to not expose what their real intentions are. Look up the video for The Neutered Noel. </p>

<p>CPP features a lot of weird band posters too with subtle pedophilic symbols included in the designs. </p>

<p>There you go, actual creepy empirical evidence of weird fuckery.</p>

<p>The Dutroux affair and Pizzagate are definitely real but don&#39;t fall into the trap of thinking Republicans are going to save you. Trump was tight with both Epstein and the Clintons, flew on the lolita express, had a pedophile for a campaign worker (Tim Nolan) and another pedophile for a financial backer (Senator Ralph Shorty). `100% of politicians are compromised and can&#39;t be trusted to clean things up.

    <div class="md"><p>No, that’s what you want everyone to believe but that is simply not the case. I want to also mention that James Alefantis is not on the up and up. Here we have a man who was pronounced the 49th most powerful man in Washington DC by GQ magazine. His occupation? Pizza restaurant owner, and for most of the week the kitchen is open for 4 hours a day. Now let’s say you think there is nothing wrong with his disgusting instagram posts. Fine. However, there was found to be a <a href="https://youtu.be/TnW7OT6Dkuw">protected section on the Comet Ping Pong website</a>. What was on that protected section? According to Titus Frost (real name Dean Fougere) and the hacker Bigfish, there was “Cheese Pizza” aka Child Pornography on that website. <a href="https://youtu.be/HTRewHDOr90">In this video, you can see the e-mails that we’re sent to the Washington DC police department officer Marcus Stevens, and he shows that Officer Marcus Stevens confirmed receipt of the e-mail as well.</a> And to the naysayers who will inevitably come out of the woodwork to say that there is no real proof to what I am saying and that the e-mails could have been fabricated, as could evidence of the protected section of the Comet Ping Pong website, I would like to remind you that falsely accusing someone of possessing and distributing child pornography is an extremely serious crime which would almost certainly result in jail time if James Alefantis were to persue a lawsuit against Dean Fougere andthr hacker Bigfish, so if you honestly think that these men would risk their freedom by making up this whole story in order to get more views on their YouTube video or whatever motive you can come up with, you’re out of your mind.</p>

<p>witch hunt....honestly it&#39;s laughable.  all people are doing is connecting dots and posting links.  but it&#39;s a witch hunt.  okay. </p>
