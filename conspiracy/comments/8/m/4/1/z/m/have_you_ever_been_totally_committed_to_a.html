    <div class="md"><p>Well that was interesting.</p>

<p>Joe says the USA, through CIA Project Paperclip, scooped up the Nazi German scientists to build nuclear bombs after World War II (Germany surrendered in 1945).</p>

<p>But the Manhattan Project was already underway by 1939 via British front company Tube Alloys. Many of the notorious scientists working on the technology were Jews from Germany actually.</p>

<p>The Fat Man nuclear bomb was being tested in 1944 by Oppenheimer (family of Jewish descent). Werner von Braun and pals weren&#39;t brought to the USA until 1945.</p>

<p>Joe needs to do some more research on this I think, because he makes it out to seem like the Nazi&#39;s came to the USA and built nuclear bombs, but it was primarily Jews working on the high tech nuclear stuff before Germany&#39;s surrender.</p>

<p>And then the dropping of the bombs was highly criticized by everyone. The Jewish scientists who worked on it felt guilty. Could this be why there is a Holocaust story behind this, so that the Jewish scientists behind the devastating act wouldn&#39;t be hated for their ignorance while making the nuclear bombs?</p>

<p>I encourage anyone questioning this to actually research it, you will be surprised by what you find.</p>

<p>I think the level of interesting answer you&#39;re looking for would be for a hardcore believer of flat earth, let&#39;s say.  Then your question would be better suited asking someone from a religious background who is no longer religious, as what you&#39;re asking seems to be more analogous.</p>

<p>Let me turn this around for you. The process of coming to believe in a conspiracy theory represents exactly what you are talking about - a rejection of a previously held belief in another narrative. Good conspiracy theories do not emerge ab nihilo.</p>

<p>I used to believe the conspiracy theory that 19 crazed Jihadis, under instructions from Osama bin Laden, hijacked four Boeing passenger planes which were then flown into the World Trade Centre Towers and also into the Pentagon. On the balance of the evidence, for and against the official 9/11 Conspiracy Theory, I was clearly wrong.</p>

<p>I have also changed my mind about the greatest, and most ludicrous conspiracy theory of the 20th century. Yes, I once believed the narrative that the German state conspired to exterminate 6 million European Jews by herding them into modified shower rooms, and dropping de-lousing pellets on them. I used to believe that they covered this crime up by implausibly cremating every single one of the bodies in ovens so hot that not even bone fragments survived. 6 million souls just vanished into thin air.</p>

<p>Crazy, right? It&#39;s most ridiculous and far-fetched, unevidenced, conspiracy theory ever thought up, and I used to believe it. Boy, was I wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most successful false &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; are the ones pushed by governments and the media working in tandem. These narratives are believed due to repetition and psychological manipulation.</p>

<p>However, because these  &quot;theories&quot; are actually disinfo, they don&#39;t stand up well to scrutiny. Scratch the surface of the &quot;homicidal gas chambers&quot; narrative, and you find that what you were taught - what you thought you knew - is not supported by any hard evidence - it&#39;s just stories, repeated ad nauseam by the press, television, the movie industry, useful idiot academics, writers and artists, to the extent that the vast majority of people actually believe the stories are real. </p>

<p>Of course, many people get really angry when presented with factual information which contradicts a story they are emotionally invested in. In the UK this week, a well known politician, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44196298">Ken Livingstone was forced to resign</a> because he made the factual observation that the from 1932 until 1939 the Nazis supported the Zionist initiative to help German Jews emigrate to Palestine, the location of the future Jewish state. </p>

<p>This collaboration between the Nazis and German Zionists, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement">Haavara Agreement</a> resulted in tens of thousands of German Jews emigrating to Palestine. </p>

<p>However, this dirty secret is not part of history which people learn about at school, and the reaction in the UK, pushed by a very dishonest media, is that Livingstone is a bigot,  because the idea that Nazis and Zionists collaborated flies in the face of their (mis)understanding of a very important part of world history. </p>

<p>Some people can&#39;t deal with the cognitive dissonance of their worldview being challenged by evidence, or learning that what they thought was fact, was (largely) made up. This sub exists for those people who have learned to question the things they once believed. It&#39;s a process, though, and the key is to NOT become fixated on an alternative narrative which may not be the (whole) truth either. </p>

<p>I used to think media and government were opposing forces. It’s pretty clear after seeing the collusion for so many media fakery hoaxes they are, in fact, just different branches of the same office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I flip flop on the Apollo 11 landing about once a year. If you look back at the previous Apollo missions and other orbiters/probes the USA did, it would seem they would have had enough &quot;stock footage/photography&quot; to produce a spectacle like a faked Apollo 11 landing. But that means the astronauts would know, and I&#39;m not sure they&#39;d be able to hold that kind of secret without being severely dosed with LSD or something. But looking at all the false flags and lies that have been floated around by various appendages of government recently, I&#39;d say it&#39;s important to keep an open mind about some things, especially those with a little mystery or fishiness to them. Like why are all the moon rock samples missing, and all the original footage. That&#39;s like one of the biggest heirlooms of our species, so when they &quot;lose&quot; them it makes you go wtf?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every day that passes since Apollo makes it clearer and clearer that no one ever went. Fun fact, NASA is strongly rooted in freemasonry, the god of which is Lucifer. Apollo is mentioned in the Bible as Apollyon, i.e. Apollo, i.e. Lucifer. </p>

<p>As for the astronauts, they give it away every time they speak. Armstrong withdrew into seclusion, Michael Collins wrote a book which contradicts some other items about the missions, and Aldrin is a drunken fool whose very demeanor testified that he never went to space. </p>

<p>As we approach the 50 year anniversary it should be obvious to ALL that we never went. I look forward to this milestone to see how it is handled by NASA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unlikely that you will get any sort of satisfactory answer here, because of how the human brain works.  </p>

<p>The human brain does not like to be told its wrong. There&#39;s an enormous amount of study behind the idea that people become wedded to their beliefs--especially if they feel they have &#39;searched&#39; them out.  </p>

<p>If evidence appears to the contrary of these beliefs, people are likely to *refuse to see it, *alter it to match their beliefs or *only see the part of evidence that -already- matches their belief. </p>

<p>So if someone--anyone--has pursued what they feel is a journey to a &#39;truth&#39; (in this case a conspiracy theory, but it can be any &#39;belief/truth&#39;), the chances of them suddenly reversing course is very, very small. It&#39;s also why all over the internet, people attempt to point out things (on any subject, on any side) and just get yelled down by those who oppose what is being pointed out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. We are all subject to potential biases, but only a few are willing to seriously reflect on this aspect of themselves and attempt to improve their own &#39;thinking about about thinking&#39;.</p>

<p>One of the most important things I learned to do was source my claims. Find citations. Provide some kind of external corroboration of what I was trying to say. It makes it easier for me to challenge my own beliefs, and encourages others to do the same.</p>

<p>On this sub, however, when I ask people for sources or citations, I tend to get downvoted.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>Jep I don&#39;t always agree with you but am glad you know this</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would feel a little bit strange if anybody on earth agreed with me about everything.</p>

<p>My own views change from year to year, as I learn more things, and challenge my own preconceived notions.</p>

<p>So somebody who agrees with me today may disagree in a year, and vice versa.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t got it all figured out yet. Far from it.</p>

<p>As for <em>The Number 23</em>, I believe there are intentional allusions to <em>The Truman Show</em> within <em>The Number 23</em>.</p>

<p>For just one example, consider the respective scenes concerning stairs and wives.</p>

<p>Have you seen the recent Netflix documentary <em>Jim and Andy</em>? An absolute must-see for any fans of Jim Carrey.</p>

<p>As for me, I used to believe in the &#39;creature from jekyll island&#39; story about money and banking. Now I see that story as merely a myth, a lovely cover story.</p>

<p>Also I used to believe that the Russians were responsible for MH17. Now I see that the entire event -- the plane crash itself -- was a gigantic hoax. Nobody died, nobody got hurt. There was no plane.</p>

<p>Similar to 9/11. I used to believe it was a &#39;inside job&#39;. Now I see that it too was a gigaatic hoax. Nobody died, nobody got hurt.</p>

<p>Doctor&#39;s pulling bullets and resuscitating trauma victims. </p>

<p>Coroners doing autopsies and writing reports. </p>

<p>Lawyers executing wills. </p>

<p>HR reps approving family medical leaves. </p>

<p>And then there are neighbors like yourself, friends, family, coworkers etc... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your questions.</p>

<p>Not really, I don&#39;t reassess my thoughts about other tragedies. If people think/believe nobody died, let them. They are free to do so, I don&#39;t feel any anger or the likes towards them but that&#39;s my personal stance. Some relatives of alleged victims can behave differently. It did give my some motivation to delve more into the story of MH17.</p>

<p>And I think that even if people involved with the aftermath found something suspicious, they would need to find an outlet that would give them the opportunity to voice their concerns. That can be tricky with our current media landscape.</p>

<p>On a sidenote, I have just received a notice from a moderator of r/The Netherlands that I am banned after posting in a thread regarding MH17 where I asked one of the participants some questions like &quot;why did Australia, Malaysia. Belgium etc sign a non-disclosure agreement&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember all the fuss about a financial crash on Sept 23 2015. All the evidence stacked up that the system was due to crash and maybe collapse altogether. I fell for it. Even made financial decisions to prepare for it. Of course, nothing happened. The same doom mongers are still crying wolf almost every day and will continue until the day they are actually right.</p>

<p>I still think there will be a crash and maybe even a full reset, but they can probably keep the system propped up for as long as they want to.</p>
