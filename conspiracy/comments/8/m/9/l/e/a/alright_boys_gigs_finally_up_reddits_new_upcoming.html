        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is...</p>

<p>The darkest hour.</p>

<p>Reddit is completely over taken and on its road to literally becoming a corporation.</p>

<p>This is monumental and we need all eyes on deck. </p>

<p>The Reddit sub-Reddit communities are literally about to be sold out, right underneath all of our feed.</p>

<p>These new policy changes are truly disturbing. Please. Take a look yourself then I&#39;ll narrow it down as another user did.</p>

<p><a href="Https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-may-25-2018">Https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-may-25-2018</a></p>

<p>First things first. I highly recommend you delete all old comments on any and everyone of your Reddit accounts. To do so, here&#39;s a complete guide</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackfellas/comments/8b5e3k/guide_how_to_delete_all_of_your_reddit_comments/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackfellas/comments/8b5e3k/guide_how_to_delete_all_of_your_reddit_comments/</a></p>

<p>I have an old account I&#39;m sure a few of you know of. I am in the process of mass-deleting my entire comments archive. I recommend you do too.</p>

<p>Now. Why do I sound so worried? Let&#39;s break it down as <a href="/u/911bodysnatchers322">/u/911bodysnatchers322</a> did within <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a> so elegantly.</p>

<p>I mean who the hell reads TOS these days. Great catch, mate!</p>

<p>Here is the original thread that flagged my alarm bells</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/8m7j0x/why_im_finally_leaving_reddit_in_about_2_wks_or/">https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/8m7j0x/why_im_finally_leaving_reddit_in_about_2_wks_or/</a></p>

<p>And with a thread at only 40 upvotes?! All of Reddit needs to know this. Fucking today.</p>

<p>Basically, as he already mentions, this is an intellectual property rights logistics nightmare. Not only that but they dance around the law like a snake trying to avoid stinging honey bees.</p>

<p>Alright let&#39;s get to the meat and potatoes </p>

<p>Content Ownership Issue</p>

<p>It basically says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms. Except as permitted through the Services or as otherwise permitted by us in writing, your license does not include the right to: a) license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or Content; b) modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services or Content; or c) access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service, except as permitted under the Reddit API Terms of Use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It gets really scary... Corporation level scary.</p>

<p>Look at this shit</p>

<p>You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Reddit the following license to use that Content:</p>

<p>When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed. This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.</p>

<p>But wait. There&#39;s more. </p>

<p>[3rd party content] We can spy on you in any way we want</p>

<p>[3rd party content] We can send you malicious javascript attack ads that have the potential to get you banned</p>

<p>[Things you can&#39;t do] If we arbitrarily decide to ban TRUEPUNDIT or DAILYCALLER because we capriciously (wrongfully) deem it to be hate speech and/or inappropriate and/or fake news and/or malicious javascript attack ad site (you know, like &#39;us&#39;, hee!), ((or just straight up the truth which is that we don&#39;t like it politically)) and you post that OR post the archive version of it, we can ban you.</p>

<p>We can use your username for our own content (ie: we can gaslight and appropriate your username &#39;likeness&#39;),</p>

<p>We can use AI + NLP to copy your style</p>

<p>We can give your content to whomever we want for whatever reason</p>

<p>We can capriciously cancel your account for any reason</p>

<p>We can sell accounts (&quot;You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior written approval.&quot;). This one is tricky, you have to read between the lines. &quot;without our prior written approval&quot;--this means they can be PAID to approve people to sell accounts, if they can do ONE, they can do THOUSANDS, so people can AI botnet and karma whore and then sell accounts to Fort Meade.</p>

<p>We can create and allow bot accounts for our corporate overlords (see above)</p>

<p>We can even hijack video content as ours, even if its from google -- so we can launder IP this way (that&#39;s how I read it but I&#39;m not a lawyer)</p>

<p>If you use reddit at work, your company is liable for any actions you take on reddit</p>

<p>&quot;Your license does not include the right to: license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or Content;&quot; -- I read this as &quot;it doesn&#39;t give you a right, because that&#39;s what COPYRIGHTS are for&quot;-- I wouldn&#39;t worry about this as much as I initially did</p>

<p>Looks like the corporate overlords are pulling out one last measure.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t let them win this time, and they won&#39;t!</p>

<p>I am prepared to do this. I&#39;ve already deleted (well still am) old comments off my old account (so it can&#39;t be sold or used or used against me or get me banned or in trouble with a future job or whatever)</p>

<p>Do you guys see the scope of this problem?</p>

<p>Please. If you don&#39;t believe me just read the god damn TOS yourself</p>

<p><a href="Https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-may-25-2018">Https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-may-25-2018</a></p>

<p>Guys this is seriously, seriously, a huge attack on individual freedom and property rights.</p>

<p>They won&#39;t win and they can&#39;t win and we won&#39;t let them win.</p>

<p>MODS &amp; USERS of conspiracy! I have infrastructure setup for a migration if we need to do it. I&#39;ve already setup a necessary off site forum ages ago for personal archiving and sharing. No financial motive, I don&#39;t even take donations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to post a link without mod approval but if this is the kind of reality Reddit corporate overlords want to try to pull over us, then I&#39;m going to be gone. And I recommend we all be gone too because all that will be left is corporate shills and AI&#39;s and bots (all using your information and writing flow/technique by the way)</p>

<p>This is dirty dirty stuff.</p>

<p>Conspiracy. This needs to be news. This needs to be seen. Please. Spread awareness. Make your own threads on other sub reddits</p>

<p>This is truly BREAKING and deserves all the fucking caps locks (despite the rule)</p>

<p>Please.</p>

<p>Read.</p>

<p>The TOS</p>

<p>And see!</p>

<p>In the mean while let&#39;s plan our strategy because we have a few weeks at most to make a choice...</p>

<p>This seems normal, as people can already get your content</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example: You take and upload a landscape photo. An advertiser wants to use that photo in an ad campaign. Reddit has the right to sell them the use of that photo without your approval and without attributing it to you. They get to make money off your content, and you don&#39;t even get the recognition.</p>

<p>What if you are a loyal Republican and the Democrats want to use your photo in one of their ads? You have no say in the matter. You have granted Reddit the right to sell your photo to the Democrats, and you can&#39;t stop them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you think reddit is claiming they own Game of thrones if someone links to it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, and that is a stupid example because Game of Thrones is not &quot;your&quot; Content. If the copyright holders of Game of Thrones uploaded a video of their show to Reddit, then <em>they</em> would be bound by the TOS.</p>

<p>Reddit is claiming a perpetual, irrevocable and nearly unlimited right to use <em>your</em> content if <em>you</em> upload it. They can claim it as their own. They can sell it. They can make derivative works from it. They can do anything the copyright owner can do <em>except</em> prevent you as the copyright owner from also selling it or making derivative works from it.</p>

<p>This is why the copyright owners of Game of Thrones do not upload clips of their show to Reddit - at least not without negotiating a contract that does not grant Reddit these sweeping rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, say you&#39;re sitting watching TV one day, and you see your photo being used by an ad, specifically for something that&#39;s not reddit.</p>

<p>You go online and find the owner of the company advertising and call their head office. You tell them you&#39;re the owner of the photograph and have proof, and have granted no rights to use it.</p>

<p>You ask them how they came into possession of your intellectual property. There&#39;s two answers: either they acquired it themselves by stealing it directly from the source, or reddit sold it to them.</p>

<p>If they acquired it themselves, they are directly liable for paying the royalties due to you. If reddit sold it to them, reddit is liable for paying the royalties due to you. In both cases this is illegal and you can sue them.</p>

<p>However, by utilizing reddit&#39;s hosting you&#39;re relinquishing rights to withhold distribution. So people can download, and modify it at will. But any derivative works used for profit are still partially yours and you are entitled to your royalties.</p>

<p>Any failure to attribute copyright material being used for profit, whether accessed for free or not, is illegal. But, the attribution is a financial sense, they don&#39;t have to announce to the world that you made the content, they just have to pay you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit assumes that anything you post is creative commons, unless it is linked from a third party site (hence having their own upload engine and control over imgur, by using their tools, they&#39;re essentially locking the content into that constraint). If reddit automatically owned linked content, then they would own the better portion of posts to <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>. They <em>DO NOT</em> have the right to use the content, as provided, by the site being linked. Any usage for profit would compromise them: they&#39;d be stuck in a position owing royalties while simultaneously claiming royalty-free status (creative commons, which is what the better portion of reddit actually is). As such, anything linked through reddit is still bound by the linked site&#39;s TOS, reddit simply provides specific rights in its TOS to allow reddit to act as an intermediary when directing traffic to your site. As such, it owes you no royalties as a <em>distributor</em>, and anything that is posted through reddit affiliates is now assumed creative commons. That&#39;s why you don&#39;t post photos to imgur or reddit that you want to make money on. Post it first to a site that retains your monetary rights, and link it. There&#39;s a system for a reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Where does it say that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If reddit automatically owned linked content, then they would own the better portion of posts to <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the TOS:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By submitting Your Content to the Services, <strong>you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content</strong> contained within these Terms. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So does someone posting a link to news owe royalties to the site they linked? Why or why not?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they&#39;d be stuck in a position owing royalties while simultaneously claiming royalty-free status </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet, they&#39;ve created this position exactly with their TOS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s why you don&#39;t post photos to imgur or reddit that you want to make money on</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what you&#39;re saying is that unless you&#39;ve added a layer of protection by involving a 3rd party and their profits, Reddit <em>can</em> do exactly what this post is claiming. Also, that the only reason a 3rd party buffer works is because they will challenge the catch-22 of owing royalties yet being exempt you just described... something which would be difficult if not impossible for an individual to do?</p>

<p>Seems to me like you just admitted that&#39;s exactly what Reddit is doing.</p>

Who were these idiot &quot;experts&quot; and economists from all these publications saying the price would top 20,000 by the end of 2018? That didn&#39;t go well to say the least, no?</p>

<p>People just like you (literally spewing the same talking points from the articles you read from &quot;experts&quot;) focus on trying to sell the <em>dream</em> of what btc <em>could</em> do...but it donit for your <em>own</em> financial interests. Because the more people who pull out...that&#39;s not good for you, right?</p>

<p>You are a living advertisement. That is what btc shills have relegated themselves to being.</p>

<p>I love watching the crypto pyramid schemes fail. Uncontrollable cryptos, with exchanges that can&#39;t agree on prices, over 400 other cryptos. All going under one by one.</p>

<p>Mate, tell me what causes btc price to go up and how does it make an entity money? Not how does make holders money. <em>To make it simple</em>: what is btc built on and how does the price go up without creating or funding something?  It&#39;s not like a legitimate stock that builds or detracts from a company. </p>

<p>Dude there&#39;s not even 400 national currencies on the planet. Yet the whole world agrees on defined, national currency rates. Then look at crypto prices. Out of control and no exchanges are able align their prices together, second by second. And this is why crpytos will never go anywhere in a formal fashion. Cryptos came around 50 years too late. If computers existed at the time that could handle crypto stuff, then things could&#39;ve gone somewhere. But if you think dishevelled crypto currencies are going to beat big business, Globalism (most notably Globalism) and any major bank in the first world...you are wasting time, attention and money. I&#39;ve been watching the fanboy wagon shit ever since btc hit 5000. Have a degree in economics. I&#39;m no fool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I admire your chutzpah but this all seems like a big, fat nothing burger.  I figured Reddit was doing all the stuff you mentioned anyway.  Can you please lay it out for me in plain words how these changes benefit corporations?  To me, it seems like Reddit wants to be regarded in the same vein as other social networking sites; for instance, when a newscaster says, “some random person made this comment on Twitter,” he’ll now be able to say “this user posted this meme on Reddit.”
Reddit is a business like any other and the necessary amenities of being a front runner of the social networking industry have overhead.  They’ve started to implement advertisements between posts and this is just another measure to increase profit margins.  In several years you might see on the back of a box of cereal the Facebook f, the Twitter bird, the Snapchat camera, and now the Reddit... uhh, whatever their mascot is.
If you thought that Reddit didn’t use or didn’t have a means to filter artificially intelligent shills for means of promoting corporate sponsorship or denying some conspiracies or propagating false ones before it was implicitly or explicitly stated in their terms of service, you are a fool.  The internet has been being used by corporations, crooked politicians, and swarthy bureaucrats for nefarious ends probably since its inception and I don’t understand why a subscriber to r/conspiracy is at all surprised by this information being laid out in the open or hidden behind a wall of text in a ToS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You managed to make a huge post without actually knowing anything about what you’re saying. Please, stop trying to explain legal documents now. You’ve completely failed in your understanding of it.</p>

<p>The fact is that no, Reddit doesn’t own your IP.
Further, they don’t say they can spy on you, and sending you malicious files is still hilariously illegal, and they don’t say they can or will do so.</p>

<p>They can ban you for whatever they like. That’s their right as a “corporation,” which you seem terrified of for no reason. Nothing new there.</p>

<p>No, they can’t claim to be you, including by using your username, but they can use anything you post on the site. Nothing new there.</p>

<p>They own the site, so yes, they can use bots or sell accounts. However, selling yours they cannot continue to pretend to be you. Still not new.</p>

<p>I don’t even know what you mean by “hijack video content,” but they can’t take other people’s content and claim it, and if you post someone else’s content they can still have it taken down, but if you post your own content, you’re granting them a license to use it.</p>

<p>Your company isn’t liable, that’s not how liability works.</p>

<p>Please, do read the TOS. You’re hilariously wrong about what it says.</p>

<p>Just curious - so if someone posts a short story on r/writingprompts or an insightful article to any sub that is relevant for such an article - Reddit can claim ownership of such content? Basically by posting any article here (even if for example, it is also posted on your website), you give Reddit legal rights to use your content?</p>

<p>The new TOS is very vague you see, so there are plenty of possible interpretations. I myself am not a lawyer and don&#39;t have an in-depth knowledge on how this TOS can be interpreted in a legal framework.  Thus I admit I do not know for sure how these terms work in practice.</p>

<p>If you or any other user here has a background in Law, I&#39;d be very interested in a more in-depth explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, if you post a story on r/writingprompts you have granted Reddit a license to display that content. They can use it for that purpose, as well as whatever anyone else who views it can do. They cannot claim ownership of your content. That’d be a huge breach of IP law. The only case where that wouldn’t be true would be if you’re a Reddit employee, and you posted content on the site during work time. </p>

<p>Posting something on Reddit (or Facebook/Twitter/instagram/MySpace) doesn’t give the platform ownership of the content, just a license to it. If I put a photo of a friend on Facebook, I still own the photo, not Facebook. But Facebook has a right to display that photo (and facebook’s also trying to get the ok to use it in ads, but that’s irrelevant to this conversation) unless I remove it. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you make a drawing. I say that you can hang it in my art gallery, but if you do, I get [insert reddit&#39;s new TOS here].</p>

<p>The TOS I made you sign does not just cover my ability to display your art in my gallery, as the ignorant OP is asserting. It provides me an irrevocable, perpetual license to use it or adapt IP based on it with no attribution to you.</p>

<p>That means I can put it in a book, I can base a show around it, I can make a movie in its art style - whatever I want.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how OP is reading the TOS and coming to the conclusions that they are. They&#39;re not a lawyer, but this isn&#39;t exactly complex stuff. It&#39;s plain language.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TLDR; they can but they won&#39;t. </p>

<p>I believe that you&#39;re right. Reddit can potentiallu take your content, remove metadata that would identify it ad your work, and do pretty much whatever they wanted woth it. The TOS makes that pretty clear, but as others have pointed out, it&#39;s pretty standard language for any social media company these days. Its just the companies covering their asses. Those teams of lawyers they pay millions and millions of dollars are bound by their dutu to peotwct their client, and the insane length and complexity of TOS agreements isnt so much a sinister conspiracy as it is a natural outgrowth of an increasingly litigious society.</p>

<p>But I think the more important point here is that these companies <em>don&#39;t</em> do many of the things that OP seems to be losing their mind over. And it is obvious why: if they did, they would alienate soooo many of their users, and tarnish their broader reputation so badly, that it would just never be worth it. </p>

<p>Imagine if Reddit published a book called u/RamsesThePigeon: Tales from the Mind of a Mad Bird, and gave zero credit to Ramses - maybe even going so far as to delete his account and ban his IP so he couldn&#39;t keep posting. Can you imagine the backlash? The pure fury of the Reddit rage machine coming to life like a tiger on meth? It would be ugly, and maybe I&#39;m off, but my guess is a move like that would be the end of Reddit as we know it. </p>

<p>Even something like Reddit selling images from r/EarthPorn to somw calendar company would provoke a ton of ill will, and all those great photographers would simply stop posting here.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s not to say that they aren&#39;t profiting off of your content in other ways. Of course they are. But OP is claiming that the sky is falling, and Reddit now fully owns all your IP and is going to be publishing it themselves and cutting you out of the deal. That&#39;s just alarmist bullshit imho. </p>

<p>But technically you are right, and the other users who are saying Reddit <em>couldn&#39;t</em> sell your content if they really wanted to, are wrong. </p>

<p>That is true, they can&#39;t claim <em>ownership</em> - what they can claim is a perpetual (which means forever), irrevocable (which means it can&#39;t be taken away from them) license to use your work any way they see fit, including selling it. You also give up your right to have your content attributed to you as the author of the work.</p>

<p>If you understood how law applies across differing jurisdictions, you&#39;d know that this is a very simple issue. It&#39;s essentially &#39;void where prohibited,&#39; which is essentially a savings clause.</p>

<p>The strictest reading of the TOS applies, but if a particular term is invalid in a particular jurisdiction, it invalidates that term, not the overall agreement.</p>

<p>It is clearly valid under U.S. law. I believe it&#39;s valid under EU law. If you think it&#39;s not, you need to do better than referencing a massive set of regulations as if their existence proves your point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay let me make this really really simple for you.</p>

<p>1) The TOS says that you provide an IP license that is irrevocable and survives the deletion of your account.</p>

<p>2) You say that under EU law, an IP license MUST be revoked upon deletion of the account.</p>

<p>3) You also say that the TOS has been rewritten to comply with EU law.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even a debate about how to interpret EU law, you&#39;re literally contradicting yourself. How is the TOS rewritten to comply with EU law when YOU YOURSELF say it has provisions that violate EU law???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes we are apparently arguing in this post about another issue,</p>

<p>the GDPR is about transparency in handling personal information, I think they may be not considering uploaded data, such as images as a part of this, I have looked through the site.</p>

<p>The discussion here seems to have made people actually start reading the TOS, and find these other things that are questionable, and I do not think neither reddit nor EU considers uploaded content as personal information. Which is why the part in the TOS about the content surviving termination, is in the TOS even in the latest revision.</p>

<p>What GDPR talks about is &quot;Right to be Forgotten:
Also known as Data Erasure, the right to be forgotten entitles the data subject to have the data controller erase his/her personal data, cease further dissemination of the data&quot;</p>

<p>The only place they talk about images or photos is about the data derived from processing them, such as facial recognition, not about the storage of the images themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, if you post a story on r/writingprompts you have granted Reddit a license to display that content. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, as the TOS explicitly states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, <strong>adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display</strong> Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed. <strong>This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit</strong>. <em>You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not that that&#39;s complex legalese, but they are saying they have an irrevocable, perpetual license to do whatever they want with your content. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They cannot claim ownership of your content. That’d be a huge breach of IP law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what a fucking service agreement is for in the first place!! By submitting content to the site you are waiving your right of exclusive use of your IP. I&#39;m not sure what you even think you&#39;re saying here.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s cool on this sub for the top comments to be aggressively contrarian, but you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about and you&#39;re attacking them for doing the same thing.</p>

<p>Also, no, if you take the content down from reddit the license to do whatever they want with your content doesn&#39;t end. That&#39;s what irrevocable means.</p>

<p>Having a basic understanding of copyright law (which it doesn&#39;t even seem like you do) is an entirely separate agreement with a TOS agreement that includes IP licensing.</p>

<p>Being wrong is fine, but don&#39;t aggressively go after other people for their lack of understanding while you don&#39;t know what the fuck you&#39;re talking about either. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And your attempt at refuting it was full of total nonsense. Reddit doesn&#39;t technically &quot;own&quot; your content, but it&#39;s granted a license that confers literally all of the benefits of ownership. You don&#39;t seem to understand that.</p>

<p>Nope. Once again, the whole point of the edit to the TOS was so that you could delete your account/data and they would no longer have rights to it, due to the new law in the EU.</p>

<p>This is just such a disingenuous way of arguing. First of all, EU law applies to EU jurisdictions. You&#39;re arguing that the OP&#39;s reading of the TOS is wrong because it may not apply that way in the EU. </p>

<p>However, OP was completely correct in their interpretation of the TOS for countries outside the EU.</p>

<p>Further, the GDPR protects individuals about data associated with them. It&#39;s at the very BEST, unclear how it would apply to an IP license associated with potentially anonymous accounts, as that&#39;s not really the data subjects that the GDPR &#39;right to be forgotten&#39; rules apply to.</p>

<p>However if you have a link that backs up your bold assertions, I&#39;d be interested to read it. My guess is that you don&#39;t, and you&#39;re still just going with your gut...</p>

<p>No, it wasn&#39;t. Even your own arguments are the opposite of that. You&#39;re saying elements of the TOS don&#39;t apply to the EU because they&#39;d be against EU law.</p>

<p>How does that mesh with claiming the TOS was written to comply with EU law?</p>

<p>There’s no separate TOS that applies outside the EU, hence the compliance with the law must be within the TOS.</p>

<p>Jesus christ dude, that&#39;s not how it works at all. It&#39;s the opposite. The TOS is as broadly written as it can be - if there are particular jurisdictions where some provisions don&#39;t apply, that&#39;s that.</p>

<p>Reddit is not going to limit their business options in the US by having a universal TOS under EU guidelines. </p>

<p>The paragraph of legalese around that is extremely standard and reflects all of the creative ways that companies have been sued by people trying to collect royalties for content they voluntarily submitted.</p>

<p>The TOS goes a hell of a lot further than that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That section means Reddit can sell your content to a 3rd party without even acknowledging that it is your content. Oh, and once you grant them this license by posting your content to Reddit, it can never be revoked.</p>

<p>They essentially become co-authors of your content and can act as if they own it, with one exception - they can&#39;t stop <em>you</em> from selling it to 3rd parties.</p>

<p>My biggest issue with what you cited is the waiver of attribution rights. While I&#39;m not convinced their intent is sinister (vs. just &quot;covering their bases&quot; in a standard, one-sided, corporate terms of use agreement), that certainly seems unnecessary and abusive.</p>

<p>3) The old TOS already granted a license for comments.</p>

<p>The line between comment/content is a big one as far as IP goes. Whether a text submission (such as a writingprompt) is considered to be content or a comment would be an interesting question (that very may well be covered in the TOS already).</p>

<p>TBH I&#39;d be surprised if they didn&#39;t ask for permission anyway in certain circumstances anyway under the new TOS just due to the bad PR it can create.</p>

<p>The quotes around the internet and in printed periodicals wouldn&#39;t ask for permission because they&#39;d be under fair use provisions, which are strengthened with an attribution.</p>

<p>As I recall, granting permission to use parts of the the AMA was a pretty straightforward process.  I was contacted by the admins, gave them written permission, and a few months later they sent me a very nice, professionally published anthology.</p>

<p>The AMA itself generated fair number of other corporate and individual requests for interviews, podcasts, film and TV segments, magazine articles and the like. <em>They</em> generally contacted me through reddit&#39;s PM app.</p>

<p>I view my posting on this forum as separate from my professional writing, so unless a request is from some recognizable public entity, I generally make my content available for free anyway.  </p>

<p>It occurs to me that adding some disclaimer to the bottom of all of one&#39;s reddit posts (&quot;poster reserves all rights of imprimatur&quot; or somesuch) might add some small measure of copyright protection, especially <em>vis a vis</em> original story content or filmic treatment.</p>

<p>Nope, that&#39;s not how it works - regardless of the existence of a ToS or not, and irrespective of what it contains, copyright law overrides what le reddit wants.</p>

<p>International Copyright law grants, for such time as is legally defined, ownership of content <em><strong>at the very instant the content is created</strong></em>, if le reddit wanted to buy it, they would need to contract you, with terms and consideration, or buy it from you on a per property or object basis, again with terms and consideration.</p>

<p>Oh sweet fucking irony. I&#39;m just going to copy/paste my other comment with the hope it gets some visibility and your stupid-ass &quot;analysis&quot; of the new TOS doesn&#39;t remain at the top of the thread:</p>

<p>I am a lawyer and your reading of the issue is dead wrong. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, if you post a story on r/writingprompts you have granted Reddit a license to display that content. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, as the TOS explicitly states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, <strong>adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display</strong> Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content <strong>in all media formats and channels now known or later developed</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit</strong>. <em>You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not that that&#39;s complex legalese, but they are saying they have an irrevocable, perpetual license to do whatever they want with your content. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They cannot claim ownership of your content. That’d be a huge breach of IP law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what a fucking service agreement is for in the first place!! By submitting content to the site you are waiving your right of exclusive use of your IP. I&#39;m not sure what you even think you&#39;re saying here.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s cool on this sub for the top comments to be aggressively contrarian, but you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about and you&#39;re attacking them for doing the same thing.</p>

<p>Also, no, if you take the content down from reddit the license to do whatever they want with your content doesn&#39;t end. That&#39;s what irrevocable means.</p>

<p>Having a basic understanding of copyright law (which it doesn&#39;t even seem like you do) is an entirely separate issue than a TOS agreement that includes IP licensing.</p>

<p>Being wrong is fine, but don&#39;t aggressively go after other people for their lack of understanding while you don&#39;t know what the fuck you&#39;re talking about either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand a damn word of that do you?</p>

<p>All of these granted rights are part of making the mechanics of reddit work. In order to display it, it has to first be parsed into code, then compiled as a component of the thread. The way the data is displayed is nothing like the way it&#39;s stored, hence, the need to be granted right to display, modify, adapt, and prepare &quot;derivative&quot; works.</p>

<p>As for the right to distribute, publicize, or broadcast, the entire point is to allow corporations like CNN to use your username and posts in their own broadcasts, if they weren&#39;t allowed to use reddit information, the whole &quot;incel&quot; issue that came up a few weeks ago would&#39;ve been much harder for them to report on as they would&#39;ve had to ask the individual to use their content not reddit.</p>

<p>However, you as the user should realize that by posting to a public forum such as reddit, you are offering up your information to the public on a need-to-access basis. So you shouldn&#39;t be surprised when somebody wants to use your data as you&#39;re already consuming others&#39; data directly from reddit.</p>

<p>That&#39;s completely wrong. Those issues would be covered under fair use provisions - this is really really basic IP and First Amendment stuff.</p>

<p>You have a fundamental misunderstanding of the rights being granted in the TOS. It&#39;s about rights being given to REDDIT, not CNN or other news organizations. Reddit is the one who can adapt and distribute/prepare derivative works. </p>

<p>CNN already has that right as a news organization under fair use provisions based in the First Amendment. I&#39;m not sure how you come to the conclusion that the TOS applies to CNN instead of reddit itself.</p>

<p>Again I&#39;m not sure why people who clearly have no understanding of the law are being so aggressive with their ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No u!</p>

<p>Sorry, I couldn&#39;t help myself when I saw that last bit.</p>

<p>On a more serious note though, how would one properly copyright their IP? Would you have to go through a solicitor or lawyer to say you own said content? Or could it be something simpler like a watermark of sorts?</p>

<p>Back in college we went over copyrighting our original content (the course was for 3D design, which covered an array of things that included 3D designs for games, architecture and the like). We were told that a very basic form of copyright would be to email yourself your work, with possibly a screenshot showing the date and time off the desktop and that this method would prove you had the original idea, design, formula, whatever, with the time and date and could help your case in a court of law if you were being sued for copyright infringement. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always thought this method was horseshit and was only really taught to us as a means to prove we did the original work in case anyone straight up copied us. The only way I can see this being practical is if it was an architectural situation - in the sense that if you designed a building or interior, and you found out a competitor somehow got your design exactly, swooped in and got he contract while trying to pass the design off as theirs originally. You could then prove you had the original design because of essentially a timestamp. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the email technique is a pretty good one! </p>

<p>Copyright in the U.S. is automatically conferred when the work is created. That means something tangible (i.e. not the idea of something), so when you write an email and send it to yourself, you&#39;re creating timestamped tangible proof of your first in time ownership of the copyright.</p>

<p>Where it gets a bit more confusing is when it comes time to enforce your copyright (which is basically the reason to have it). If someone infringes on your work, you can use your email as proof that you had it first, but in order to sue for infringement in U.S. courts you need to have it registered.</p>

<p>The speed with which you register it (from date of publication, not initial creation) also confers additional benefits such as additional damages.</p>

<p>So basically it&#39;s an issue between the existence of a copyright and the ability to enforce one - if you plan on publishing your work, registration is always a good idea. Once somethings in the government registry, it&#39;s prima facie (i.e. automatic/definitive) evidence in a court.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Since you have the top comment on this post, and seem to be a lawyer, would you mind explaining some things?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What sort of modifications are we talking? What types of adapted, derivitave works are they preparing and why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What sort of syndication or broadcasting would they be referring to here?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if I post an mp3 of a song I made, with metadata on it... they can <em>remove</em> the metadata, then copy the song, and broadcast it on an affiliated website without the metadata?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you&#39;ve waived your <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights">moral rights</a>?</p>

<p>Wow, moral rights are defined as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moral rights are rights of creators of copyrighted works generally recognized in civil law jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, in some common law jurisdictions. They include the right of attribution, the right to have a work published anonymously or pseudonymously, and the right to the integrity of the work.[1] The preserving of the integrity of the work allows the author to object to alteration, distortion, or mutilation of the work that is &quot;prejudicial to the author&#39;s honor or reputation&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Reddit doesn&#39;t have to attribute anything they take from you <em>to</em> you, since you&#39;ve waived that right, and if Reddit decides to twist your work into a perversion you object to, you have no right to object, either.</p>

<p>That seems to directly contradict what you said here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They cannot claim ownership of your content. That’d be a huge breach of IP law</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since you&#39;ve waived your rights of attribution and given Reddit the right to remove your metadata, alter your work, and broadcast/distribute it as their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great question that doesn&#39;t have an easy answer yet (as far as I know).</p>

<p>My guess is that that&#39;s not their intent here, but rather something generally covered under the umbrella of moral rights, which they&#39;re referring to.</p>

<p>There are a lot of issues at play here, including the fact that you don&#39;t need to provide any identifying information to reddit in order to create an account. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that you have an account with no personally identifying information, you&#39;re behind a strong VPN, use an anonymous browser, etc. - it would be difficult (both practically and legally) for reddit to find your actual identity.</p>

<p>This clause is more of an escape hatch releasing them of any obligation to attempt to find out who you are before profiting off your work (which would be your moral right). </p>

<p>It going the reverse way where by submitting content you&#39;re freeing yourself up to a loss of anonymity associated with an anonymous account? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a novel issue, and a very interesting one. My best guess is that it wouldn&#39;t provide them the ability to seek out who you are, but it&#39;s the type of thing that would have to work its way through the courts.</p>

<p>It would also be a great final exam question in law school lol. You gave me flashbacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so first, you should see my response above to MASTURBATES_YOUR_DAD to answer the first couple.</p>

<p>If you post an mp3 of a song you made, you&#39;re giving similar rights as you would to iTunes to use it in their ads. You still own the creative content rights, as well as the mechanicals for the recording. However, they (Reddit, Inc.) can then take the song, cut it down to 30 seconds, and use it to make a TV ad for reddit or something. If you are a PRO member, they still have to pay your PRO, and you will still receive all the royalties you deserve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t find your response above very illuminating. Saying that they need the right to create derivative works and not attribute them to you because they have to &quot;convert it to code&quot; doesn&#39;t make sense.

<blockquote>

<p>The iTunes TOS don&#39;t look anything like this. They won&#39;t remove your metadata and make you waive your right of attribution, for one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are a PRO member, they still have to pay your PRO</p>

<p>Not if it&#39;s a derivative work, though. And then, seemingly, since you&#39;ve waived your right to publish anonymously, they can attribute an altered or derivative work to your real world identity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>They remove the metadata <em>TO PROTECT YOU</em>. If you post a picture and all the metadata is still there, (which includes a LOT scarier information such as full name, phone model, MAC, IP, GPS coordinates, carrier, so on and so forth) somebody can doxx you much, much easier.</p>

<p>They still have to pay for a derivative work, you get the percentage of your work&#39;s contribution to the derivative.</p>

<p>Also, yes, that&#39;s exactly what it means when they have the right to modify your information, and it generally specifies 1) converting text into data so it can be stored and referenced from the DB and 2) converting your picture into a thumbnail. That&#39;s pretty much as far as reddit manipulates your data.</p>

<p>Not true. Metadata contains whatever you want. If you want your metadata to simply have your anonymous artist name or pseudonym, you can do that.</p>

<p>They still have to pay for a derivative work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they don&#39;t. The TOS specifically says anything they do with it is royalty-free.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;re really that afraid of the TOS of sites, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not. I use iTunes and other sites, because, as I&#39;ve already noted, iTunes TOS doesn&#39;t look like this and grant them these rights over content submitted to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe you should look into those steps, my friend.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a professional songwriter and have been registered with ASCAP for decades. Thanks, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re basically over complicating the entire process of saying:</p>

<p>Anything you post directly to reddit (through i.reddit or v.reddit, imgur, other affiliates) is assumed to be creative commons. Any content that&#39;s creative commons is free to distribute and modify.</p>

<p>Anything that is linked through reddit to a third party is not their responsibility to pay royalties for. Any use of that link by reddit or the community is equivalent to looking at a building on a map. They&#39;re not in the shop, yet per se.</p>

<p>They have the right to remove metadata, first to protect you, second because often that metadata is extraneous and is a handful of bytes saved on their db.</p>

<p>If you have so much concern for your creative content, don&#39;t post it to reddit. If you haven&#39;t already taken steps to protect your intellectual rights, that&#39;s on you.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all it says. They aren&#39;t trying to own your content. The implications of them trying to do so spreads much further than some dingus uploading an mp3 of their latest webcam jam sesh. It would crush their site if they suddenly attempt to claim data as their own, the number of sites that gain traffic through them is gigantic. They&#39;d be pissed if reddit tried to claim their content as reddit&#39;s.</p>

<p>So I post a music video I made and own all the rights to.</p>

<p>If I haven&#39;t in some way registered the video with a 3rd party, it essentially becomes CC for Reddit to use in any way they see fit.</p>

<p>If I&#39;ve registered with a 3rd party, Reddit can still attempt to own my content but the 3rd party will engage them legally and challenge their TOS.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Do you deny that removal of metadata can help Reddit to claim and use your works as their own, especially since you&#39;ve waived your moral rights and right to attribution ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have so much concern for your creative content, don&#39;t post it to reddit</p>

<p>Why? Because you&#39;re admitting Reddit can take your content and appropriate it for their own use without any obligations to you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s all it says</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All it says, according to what youre saying here, is that you better have a 3rd party involved or else we will take your shit?</p>

<p>Again, so unless a 3rd party is there to challenge the absurdity of the TOS and the catch-22 it creates, a regular Joe (<em>dingus</em>, as you so eloquently put it) uploading something to Reddit has given their content to Reddit on a silver platter.</p>

<p>What are you basing that claim on? Seriously, you&#39;re ignoring the plain language of the TOS and making completely unsourced claims that contradict the TOS itself.</p>

<p>Yes, for iTunes. You might notice that the TOS we&#39;re actually discussing here literally says &quot;royalty-free&quot;</p>

<p>EU law applies in the EU. Why do you keep acting like EU law applies to the whole world?</p>

<p>1) The TOS says that you provide an IP license that is irrevocable and survives the deletion of your account.</p>

<p>You stop right there</p>

<p>Why not go further and pick up where I left off instead of acting smug? You say I don&#39;t understand copyright law, then help enlighten me and explain to me concerns because this seems like a pretty big damn deal.</p>

<p>One section alone literally allows them to reach out to your work (if they had access to your work details) and make your employer responsible for what you post on reddits platform (AKA, post something we don&#39;t like and we will get you fired and homeless)</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t see that as a flag of concern then obviously apparently I&#39;m not the only one here who doesn&#39;t understand copyright law </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I linked to a detailed guide above that helps you remove and delete old comments</p>

<p>The trick is to run the automated setup and it edits each post of yours (this took me hours by the way, but it&#39;s automated so just watch a movie or get really baked)</p>

<p>And then goes aback through and deletes it all. So it edits your comment with gibberish then deletes it. In this capacity your old comments can&#39;t even be looked up on ceddit</p>

<p>If you need further help please just ask</p>

<p>Since the telecommunications act of 1996, which was ironically created for more market freedom in media, the media industry has slowly become more of a monopolized industry. The issue is compounded by the fact that media has exponentially increased its influence in capitalist nations, through the advent of the Internet and other technological advances.</p>

<p>Supreme Court case Citizens United </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case, the conservative non-profit organization Citizens United sought to air a film critical of Hillary Clinton and to advertise the film during television broadcasts shortly before the 2008 Democratic primary election in which Clinton was running for U.S. President. Federal law, however, prohibited any corporation (or labor union) from making an &quot;electioneering communication&quot; (defined as a broadcast ad reaching over 50,000 people in the electorate) within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of an election, or making any expenditure advocating the election or defeat of a candidate at any time. The court found that these provisions of the law conflicted with the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p>However, the court upheld requirements for public disclosure by sponsors of advertisements. The case did not affect the federal ban on direct contributions from corporations or unions to candidate campaigns or political parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your official sounding history in r/conspiracy. Let&#39;s go into the meat:</p>

<p>The group Citizens United was created to launch a campaign to get Clarence Thomas appointed to the Supreme Court. </p>

<p>In 2004, Citizens United complained to the FCC that the Michael Moore movie <em>Fahrenheit 9-11</em> violated FCC rules about electioneering in time of election. They lost.</p>

<p>Four years later, Citizens United made its own film, <em>Hillary The Movie</em>. The nonprofit was blocked from advertising it. </p>

<p>They took the case to court claiming that the movie was not electioneering.</p>

<p>When the case arrived at the Supreme Court, they held Oral Argument. Then, rather than decide the case on the merits of electioneering, they held the case over to the next term, changed the question, and ordered another oral argument.</p>

<p>The 5-4 Court ultimately decided to overturn a hundred years of election law and decades of court precedent, declaring by fiat that business corporations and unions along with nonprofits, could spend unlimited and undisclosed amounts of money on electioneering. </p>

<p>The dissent in the case, John Paul Stevens, noted the judicial activism of the five: &quot;Essentially, five Justices were unhappy with the limited nature of the case before us, so they changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law.&quot;</p>

<p>Although the five claimed that they were correcting conflicts of earlier cases, they blatantly created a new conflict between the way individuals and entities were allowed to electioneer. That was harmonized later on the side of billionaires, of course.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that every major corporate personhood case going all the way back to the 1800s was decided by majority Republicans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The error was allowing Michael Moore&#39;s films to run in clear violation of electioneering law.  That was the mistake the courts made in 2004.  Citizens was <em>correct</em> in the case they filed against Moore.</p>

<p>By siding with Moore and allowing one form of propaganda to run at election time, the courts opened the floodgate.  The subsequent decision was then right in regard to standing precedent.</p>

<p>Also, the <strong>FEC</strong> is the government body in question, not the FCC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We may agree or disagree about the 2004 FEC decision on <em>Fahrenheit 9-11</em> and we may complain about how one decision was inconsistent from the other.</p>

<p>One was a long-time movie maker making a movie. The other was a partisan political organization entering the realm of movie making for a campaign.</p>

<p>BUT it does not follow that we cannot tell in many cases &quot;what was political advertising.&quot; For 100 years, we have been able to tell. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the courts opened the floodgate. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does not follow that an inconsistent decision about this movie versus that movie should open any &quot;floodgates&quot; of judicial activism to go far beyond the case and permit business corporations to spend as much money as they want from their general fund for electioneering.</p>

<p>The American people had this one right in 2010:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eight in 10 poll respondents say they oppose the high court&#39;s Jan. 21 decision to allow unfettered corporate political spending, with 65 percent &quot;strongly&quot; opposed. Nearly as many backed congressional action to curb the ruling, with 72 percent in favor of reinstating limits. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of us know that unlimited &quot;electioneering&quot; corrupts our government and that our system of representative government is at stake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to me, the whole TOS/EULA stuff on most sites are updating to conform to EU laws and regulations. Basically, they are covering their butts to they don&#39;t wind up in EU courts. They are just spelling out things that were implied in previous versions of their TOS. </p>

<p>You post something to Reddit, it is your IP. However, you are wanting to share that IP via their platform, so you have to grant them permission to do so. Agreeing to the TOS gives them that permission. </p>

<p>Like others have said, they have the right to delete content because they own the platform. It is just like, if you run a blog, you would have certain standards for what comments on your posts can contain. Example: On my blog, if a comment is obviously a blatant attempt to advertise something, I will delete it. I most comments stay on the site, unless they are outright attacks on another participant in the conversation.</p>

<p>Other things you are allowing Reddit to do is track you with cookies, keep a log of your activities on the site, and other things that go on under the hood. This is just part of being on the modern Internet. </p>

<p>The only way you can totally have control of your IP is not to share it one social media, don&#39;t use online content creators (Google Docs, etc), run your a privately ran server of your own. </p>

<p>Welcome to the Online age.</p>

<p>You are safe</p>

<p>And you are loved</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to delete anything at all. Only if you feel compelled to.</p>

<p>Please note. </p>

<p>Nothing is being deleted on my account</p>

<p>But an old account of mine. Almost an old somebody I used to know.</p>

<p>I felt the need to purge and cleanse through</p>

<p>But that&#39;s old news and you know that</p>

<p>Regardless we are in the light and walk within gods grace</p>

<p>Bless you and bless your soul</p>

<p>Good day and I&#39;ve missed you </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus all you dicks arguing over terms that are too dense to parse through for the regular Dude — tell me this: is there anything here that is not standard and that needs to be worried over? And; as a content creator (musician) myself, do I need to worry about any specific legalese in regards to my ownership of my content? Like I have extensive archived proof that the work belongs to me, was created by me, etc, and it is hosted on another site which on occasion I have linked to on reddit. Like I have the raw mixes and footage and all that. When writing a novel people often talk about mailing yourself a manuscript with a date to prove it was yours and yada yada. Doesn’t my possession of original instrument recordings and raw mixes and such indisputably identify me as the creator and owner of such artwork? Essentially if you were a regular dickhead trying to take your work pro, is there anything here that potentially will fuck me in the future or otherwise allow my work to be stolen from me/perverted? I’m not trying to be the dude who like wrote the ultimate mega billion dollar song and receives no credit, profit, etc from it. </p>

<p>We&#39;re not</p>

<p>It&#39;s why I made this post</p>

<p>Why be afraid and why be shut down</p>

<p>When we can rise up and take our power back</p>

<p>All this would do would further entrap us in a endless nightmare of trying to produce &quot;value&quot; aka fake money that is printed and printed yet has no value yet we give it false value</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are multiple comments debunking much of what you said, and I read the TOS myself, most of your claims are entirely baseless and at their root come from a place of misunderstanding. This is the reason I am not concerned about these “privacy” pump and dumps that pop up from time to time: no one really cares about you that much. Reddit’s TOS is designed to protect them and sets basic rules in place that allow them to moderate the site. That’s it. There is no conspiracy, they are not trying to be you, your company is not liable for your actions on reddit. </p>

<p>I truly appreciate your effort with the original post, but maybe focus your attention on another issue. Thanks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s too much potential here for Reddit to exploit us</p>

<p>I managed moderators but haven&#39;t gotten express consent to edit my post with a direct link to my forums</p>

<p>So within this capacity I think mod chats are taking place</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was muted for 72 hours for reaching out to <a href="/r/writingprompts">/r/writingprompts</a>, however</p>

<p>Fortunately they did say that such discussion is taking place on appropriate channels.</p>

<p>Regardless</p>

<p>Awareness is cascading and that&#39;s what we need </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if I trust script programs to have access to my account, would simply deleting it be enough?</p>

<p>you wanna make a thread about advanced publications then fine but i made one about how they want to make it legal for what theyve already been doing</p>

<p>that would have sealed the deal and that kind of seal right now is not the kind of deal we want on our hands</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lawyer here. Your assumptions are completely correct. OP doesn&#39;t have a fucking clue what they&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>Adapted, derivative works means exactly what you think - basically anything. They can produce content based on your work with outside partners with no attribution or royalties owed to you. That means TV, movies, books, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so first, you should see my response above to MASTURBATES_YOUR_DAD to answer the first couple.</p>

<p>If you post an mp3 of a song you made, you&#39;re giving similar rights as you would to iTunes to use it in their ads. You still own the creative content rights, as well as the mechanicals for the recording. However, they (Reddit, Inc.) can then take the song, cut it down to 30 seconds, and use it to make a TV ad for reddit or something. If you are a PRO member, they still have to pay your PRO, and you will still receive all the royalties you deserve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>They remove the metadata <em>TO PROTECT YOU</em>. If you post a picture and all the metadata is still there, (which includes a LOT scarier information such as full name, phone model, MAC, IP, GPS coordinates, carrier, so on and so forth) somebody can doxx you much, much easier.</p>

<p>They still have to pay for a derivative work, you get the percentage of your work&#39;s contribution to the derivative.</p>

<p>Also, yes, that&#39;s exactly what it means when they have the right to modify your information, and it generally specifies 1) converting text into data so it can be stored and referenced from the DB and 2) converting your picture into a thumbnail. That&#39;s pretty much as far as reddit manipulates your data.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re really that afraid of the TOS of sites, don&#39;t use the internet. However, I personally take steps to protect my intellectual property rights. Maybe you should look into those steps, my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what Bitcoin can do: drop from 18,000 to 8,500 in how many months? I&#39;ll you answer that one. Hint: far less than a year. Who were these idiot &quot;experts&quot; and economists from all these publications saying the price would top 20,000 by the end of 2018? That didn&#39;t go well to say the least, no?</p>

<p>People just like you (literally spewing the same talking points from the articles you read from &quot;experts&quot;) focus on trying to sell the <em>dream</em> of what btc <em>could</em> do...but it donit for your <em>own</em> financial interests. Because the more people who pull out...that&#39;s not good for you, right?</p>

<p>You are a living advertisement. That is what btc shills have relegated themselves to being.</p>

<p>I love watching the crypto pyramid schemes fail. Uncontrollable cryptos, with exchanges that can&#39;t agree on prices, over 400 other cryptos. All going under one by one.</p>

<p>Mate, tell me what causes btc price to go up and how does it make an entity money? Not how does make holders money. <em>To make it simple</em>: what is btc built on and how does the price go up without creating or funding something?  It&#39;s not like a legitimate stock that builds or detracts from a company. </p>

<p>Dude there&#39;s not even 400 national currencies on the planet. Yet the whole world agrees on defined, national currency rates. Then look at crypto prices. Out of control and no exchanges are able align their prices together, second by second. And this is why crpytos will never go anywhere in a formal fashion. Cryptos came around 50 years too late. If computers existed at the time that could handle crypto stuff, then things could&#39;ve gone somewhere. But if you think dishevelled crypto currencies are going to beat big business, Globalism (most notably Globalism) and any major bank in the first world...you are wasting time, attention and money. I&#39;ve been watching the fanboy wagon shit ever since btc hit 5000. Have a degree in economics. I&#39;m no fool. </p>
