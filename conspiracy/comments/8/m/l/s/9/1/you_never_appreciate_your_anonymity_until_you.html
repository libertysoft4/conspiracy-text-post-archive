    <div class="md"><p>The fact that we need anonymity to discuss real life issues really tells you all you need to know about free speech. Where I come from is a land that had a 30 year dictatorship and the most lasting memory you hear from folks that lived through those years is how the government had spies and informants that would rat out their neighbors if they spoke ill of even how hard life was, let alone against the government. These people would be fetched from their homes, tortured and forced to rat out the people they spoke with, and they in turn would go through the same date. Most ended up “disappeared”.  Sooner or later, this will be the norm of the world government we’re headed for. </p>

<p>100% correct.</p>

<p>In Orwell&#39;s 1984, there are no laws any more. There is no need for laws.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the funniest thing I&#39;ve read in ages.  Most of the women I&#39;ve known who&#39;ve chosen STEM careers can run circles around the men around them.  They&#39;re better architects, better doctors, better engineers, just better all around.  Not the ones who got hired on quota, but the ones who chose it due to interest.  Males just can&#39;t compare to a motivated and interested female <em>especially</em> intellectually.</p>

<p>The bumper sticker slogan we get about freedom is the most that the majority of people will think about. How many take a look around, study what&#39;s going on around them, truly ask just how much freedom they have, is it a case of not having any at all anymore? No, we get this &quot;fuck yeah, we&#39;re free and always will be free. Bow down bitches!&quot; attitude. </p>

<p>The rule also deters new users from sticking around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In what way is your anonymity compromised by your account being more than 2 months old? That makes no sense.</p>

<p>The way you stay anonymous on reddit is by choosing a username which isn&#39;t related to your real name, not telling anyone what that reddit username is, and not posting information which could lead others to work out your real name. </p>

<p>The 2 month quarantine period for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a barrier to diminish trolling and abuse. It stops (most) people who have been banned from creating a new account and resuming posting immediately. It also deters those non-subscribers who create an alt account just to come here to troll and insult our sub.</p>
