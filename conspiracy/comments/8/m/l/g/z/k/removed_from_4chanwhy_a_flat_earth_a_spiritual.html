<p><strong>Yes, Kālāmas, it is proper that your have doubt, that you have perplexity, for a doubt has arisen in a matter which is doubtful. Now, look you Kālāmas, do not be led by reports, or traditions, or hearsay. Be not led by the authority of religious texts, not by the delight in speculative opinions, nor by seeming possibilities, not by the idea: &#39;this is our teacher&#39;. But, O Kālāmas, when you know for yourself that certain things are unwholesome, and wrong, and bad, then give them up... And when you know for yourself that certain things are wholesome and good, then.</strong> - Buddha</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>I tried writing this first on 4chan because I knew the sh*lls would come out here. They removed it, and gave me a banning warning.</p>

<p>I do NOT know the truth to the shape or the Earth, so this post is hypothetical. A few yeaes ago, I thought this was all completely ridiculous, but now I am not so sure.</p>

<p><strong>Why a Flat Earth?</strong></p>

<p>I am writing this to examine the <strong>possibility</strong> of flat earth with emphasis on mostly spiritual arguments. If flat earth is real, then the science we are taught today is largely a lie, which is why debating flat earth scientifically is so difficult...because then you have to start questioning things like gravity, and even college educated people cannot grasp gravity! So, for this I rely mostly on spiritual arguments to examine the possibility of flat earth.</p>

<p><strong>Question Everything</strong></p>

<p>1) Heliocentrism vs. Geocentrism: I challenge you to begin exploring the occult and sun worship. At the hands of all occult beliefs is the worship of Lucifer. Lucifer is the sun. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta11.htm">http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta11.htm</a></p>

<p>This part of it all requires a lot exploration into the occult, so I will leave this part for you to seek on your own, and I will continue.</p>

<p>Now, it was not until the 16th century that heliocentrism was even presented:</p>

<p> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism</a></p>

<p>It is said Copernicus is a freemason, though I cannot find great proof of that. With that being said, though, at the heart of the freemasonry is the worship of Lucifer. You are not allowed to say Jesus&#39;s name in a lodge. If you are interested in reading more about this, I highly recommend reading &quot;33 Degrees of Deception&quot; by Tom C. McKenney. I will go back to how the freemasonry stuff connects with flat earth throughout this post. To summarize, though, nearly all the scientists who supported heliocentrism, round earth, and gravity were in fact freemasons, which leads me to my next point.</p>

<p>2) Gravity: I never questioned it before examining flat earth, but it is necessary for a round earth. If the Earth is round, then gravity needs to be real, and there are scientists today that take real issue with gravity:
 <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/730978/Gravity-dark-matter-NOT-real-albert-Einstein">https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/730978/Gravity-dark-matter-NOT-real-albert-Einstein</a></p>

<p>Now, it is important you look into Isaac Newton, a known occultist and freemason:
 <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton%27s_occult_studies">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton%27s_occult_studies</a>
 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FBM9IVE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FBM9IVE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1</a></p>

<p>So this occultist freemason has some recognized  flaws in his theory:
 <a href="http://www.sciscoop.com/2005-10-25-55814-184.html">http://www.sciscoop.com/2005-10-25-55814-184.html</a></p>

<p>But just remember gravity is necessary for a round earth. But gravity still has major issues even today, and a lot of unsolved problems:
 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2015/12/11/the-greatest-unsolved-problem-in-theoretical-physics-why-gravity-is-so-weak/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2015/12/11/the-greatest-unsolved-problem-in-theoretical-physics-why-gravity-is-so-weak/</a></p>

<p>So they try to explain all the issues away with dark matter. They say it encompasses 80 percent of our universe, yet they are having a lot of difficulty proving it even exists:
 <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/dark-matter-missing-galaxies-ngc1052-df2-864467">http://www.newsweek.com/dark-matter-missing-galaxies-ngc1052-df2-864467</a></p>

<p>There are a lot of holes...and this is just the beginning.</p>

<p>3) Models of the Earth: Why would every ancient civilization have a similar model of the Earth - without having any form of communication with one another?</p>

<p> <a href="https://goo.gl/images/2GwSHC">https://goo.gl/images/2GwSHC</a></p>

<p>The psyop is to make flat earth look ridiculous, but if you look at the models, it is not as crazy as it seems.</p>

<p>4) The Fake Moon Landings: A lot of people think the moon landings were faked. The question is <strong>WHY?</strong> Why would they even bother?</p>

<p>Well, if the Earth is flat, there is likely a firmament; and we likely cannot escape.</p>

<p>From this point I am relying on biblical stuff. If you think the bible is fake, ok. But if it is real. Oh fuck.</p>

<p>So the moon landings may be fake because we cannot get to the moon. But still, who cares? Why would they lie?</p>

<p>5) Space as Salvation: Elon Musk claims if we go to space, we will save the human race:
 <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/elon-musk-wants-to-preserve-humanity-in-space/">https://www.cnet.com/news/elon-musk-wants-to-preserve-humanity-in-space/</a></p>

<p>What if he is lying? What if we are stuck on this shitty Earth? What if there is literally nowhere to go? Space is the new spiritual salvation. Space is real by the way. It just may not be what we think it is. </p>

<p>Space is real but may only be accessed through spiritual means. Astral projection?</p>

<p>6) Salvation?: According to the Bible, the only salvation is Christ. We cannot run or hide or escape to space. The Bible says we will have nowhere to hide.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/jeremiah/25-35.html">https://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/jeremiah/25-35.html</a></p>

<p>7) The Big Lie: Many claim it is too big of a lie, but Hitler explained why big lies work. Hitler was the best liar of all!</p>

<p> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie</a></p>

<p>Nobody will question it because it seems too ridiculous, so that is why it works.</p>

<p>8) But why lie??: If the Earth is flat, our paradigms will shatter. Flat earth means there is a God. And if there is a God...</p>

<p>Then our master is God, not the elite.</p>

<p>Even the most idiotic would see the truth. </p>

<p>9) Scientism: Before you call me out as ridiculous, the cult of scientism does exist:</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.aaas.org/page/what-scientism">https://www.aaas.org/page/what-scientism</a></p>

<p>Today the high priests of society are unquestioned, like Gods! </p>

<p>When it comes to science and math, we are all so dumbed down that even examining the truth is a feat itself. We are told it is all too complex to understand.</p>

<p>But the truth is simple.</p>

<p>10) Is the Earth flat?: Does it matter? Not really. The truth is in Christ, in my opinion.</p>

<p>But IF the Earth is flat, then God IS real.</p>

<p><strong>A Little Bit More</strong></p>

<p>The biggest evidence that space is not what we think it is is the bible itself. You are familiar with the tower of Babel. The original derivation of the name Babel(also the Hebrew name for Babylon) is uncertain, but it may come from bab-ilum, meaning &quot;gate of God.&quot; According to the Bible, the city received the name &quot;Babel&quot; from the Hebrew word balal, meaning to jumble or to confuse. Clearly, God stopped people from entering this &quot;gate of God.&quot; Is this what is happening today? Nothing is new under the sun.</p>

<p>Today there is a belief that technology or some type of ascension or new age oneness will deliver us into God&#39;s territory, essentially by making us Gods.</p>

<p>Did you know Satan is called the prince of air, too?</p>

<p> <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm</a></p>

<p>He is able to control and deceive us through the air and &quot;space&quot;...the physical world we see.</p>

<p>Further, astral mean stars. Many can access the &quot;astral&quot; realm where the stars are located. Further, one can access these realms (dimensions) through drugs or other mind altering experiences. (Still working on this). It is interesting to note that planet in the bible actually translates as &quot;wandering star.&quot;</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.bibleandscience.com/bible/books/genesis/genesis1_wanderingstars.htm">https://www.bibleandscience.com/bible/books/genesis/genesis1_wanderingstars.htm</a></p>

<p>The idea of going to space and visiting other worlds has created a false God in a sense - other realities people can worship and escape to while denying the real creator.</p>

<p>Further, if the Earth is flat and there is a firmament, then there would be no such thing as outerspace (at least nothing we can access through a space ship). The entire concept of popular occult movies like Interstellar and a Space Odyssey 2001 is space travel interdimensionally.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>This is a hypothetical spiritual post. That is all.</p>

<p>I have no way to certainly prove if the Earth is round or flat, but I am certainly questioning.</p>

<p><strong>The problem with certainty is that it is static; it can do little but endlessly reassert itself. Uncertainty, by contrast, is full of unknowns, possibilities, and risks.</strong> -  Stephen Batchelor,</p>

<p>Gravity would be created by a large massive Earth, and the shape of it would make gravity consistent (mostly) for all the flat-landers. This also allows a form of hollow Earth to exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s the &quot;standard&quot; Flat Earth model and it completely fails to explain the phenomena of sunrise and sunset. Every single video on Youtube claiming to explain the Flat Earth day/night cycle is absolute shit. Pick your favorite and I will explain where the logic breaks down.  </p>

<p>Here are some general points of consideration:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>We know the Sun is a ball. We can watch its entire rotation. It casts light in all directions. It is not focused in any particular direction.  </p></li>
<li><p>During sunset or sunrise, you can see the partial disk of the Sun divided sharply by the local horizon. There is no way to explain this with perspective or distance. The real explanation is simple: The Earth is curved and you can&#39;t see through dirt. At night, you are actually in the shadow of the Earth itself.  </p></li>
<li><p>We can confirm that the Sun shines over the entire Earth every time it casts a shadow on the surface of the moon. Unsurprisingly, this shadow is the shape of a disk because that is what happens when you shine light at a ball.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>You&#39;re honestly wasting your time. Carry on if you like, but the Earth is definitely a ball and the only conspiracy theory here is how brainwashed people have had to become to believe the Earth is flat again.  </p>

<p>My post was largely about the spiritual reasons for flat earth. That is all!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then I guess my only question is the following: How can there be spiritual reasons for Flat Earth given that we know the Earth is actually a ball and not flat? Why would any of that be relevant when we can just confirm directly for ourselves that the Earth is not flat? Why should I be interested in spiritual arguments for a hypothesis which is already proven false?  </p>

<p>You might as well be arguing that the Sun appears as a perfect equilateral triangle in the sky. &quot;I don&#39;t know if the Sun looks like a triangle or a disk, my post is mainly about the spiritual reasons for triangle Sun. That is all!&quot; Alright, I suppose you can go looking for spiritual reasons to believe that the Sun is shaped like a triangle if you want. It isn&#39;t though, so it seems like a pretty pointless endeavor. This is pretty much exactly what you&#39;re doing.  </p>

<p>If flat earth is real, then the scientific arguments would not be valid...</p>

<p>We would have been lied to scientifically.</p>

<p>So this is just a hypothetical post. Like if angels are real or something spiritual.</p>

<p>Nothing more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re arguing against scientific principles and measurements which I have personally taken the time to confirm for myself. For example, we can confirm that Earth and Venus (for example) travel around the Sun by using only a simple telescope and a little bit of patience. This confirmation is 100% conclusive and simple to understand. It is not hard to prove that the distance between the Earth and the Sun is always greater than the distance between Venus and the Sun. It is even easier to prove that the Earth is sometimes closer to the Sun than it is to Venus (the relative positions are easily observable by watching how the globe of Venus is illuminated). These two simple geometric facts immediately rule out the geocentric model, and in fact in can be rigorously proven that only heliocentric models are compatible with those observations.  </p>

<p>Like I said, you might as well be arguing that the Sun appears as an equilateral triangle in the sky every day. Anyone can walk out the door and confirm that is not the case. Almost as easily, anyone can see that the geocentric model is not true. No need to trust scientists, go look for yourself. Go measure the curvature of the Earth on some lazy afternoon. All you need is the Pythagorean theorem. It&#39;s not rocket science.  </p>

<p>Almost everything you wrote in your original post is based on very simple misunderstandings. For example, there are no scientists today arguing that gravity isn&#39;t real. The article is about a proposed tweak that has zero impact on our understanding of the gravitational forces holding the Earth and Solar System together. There&#39;s no question that gravity is real. We measure it against our best mathematical models all the time. Newton&#39;s model works just fine for understanding the gravitational forces which shape the Earth and guide the orbits of planets around the Sun. Einstein discovered that Newton&#39;s model is only an approximation for a more challenging description involving curvature of space and time. However, this more general description of gravity agrees with Newton&#39;s predictions about orbital mechanics to very good accuracy.  </p>

<p>Your hypothetical is purely abstract since the premise is easily shown to be false. </p>

<p>This is another fallacy. Our logic tells us the Earth is not moving and flat. How do we prove it or disprove it? The common man has no real means of doing so...not 100 percent proof anyway.</p>

<p>Nonsense. I literally just explained to you that any idiot can measure the curvature of the Earth. The Pythagorean theorem is a simple tool taught in elementary school and this enough to work out line of sight predictions and measure curvature. There are dozens of simple experiments to detect the motion of the Earth, too. Gyroscopes will pick up the wobble if you pay close attention and a simple Foucault&#39;s pendulum will detect the rotation.  </p>

<p>NDT is really a pop scientist. I genuinely understand theoretical physics better than him, so his failed attempt to define gravity is of no interest to me. You are missing something fundamental about the way physical models are constructed and change over time. Yes, there are still questions about gravity, but those questions have nothing to do with basic questions about planetary accretion or orbital mechanics. Newton&#39;s theory of gravity accurately predicts the motions of the planets with very little error. Einstein&#39;s theory does even better. You don&#39;t seem to understand that when we update our physical model and accept a new paradigm, that doesn&#39;t mean we throw everything out and start over. The new model has to predict everything the old model predicted, probably with improved accuracy, and it has to accurately predict things which the old model wasn&#39;t good enough to predict. You see, Newton&#39;s model works great for orbital mechanics and it explains how gravity functions for practical purposes. With Einstein, we got a much deeper insight into the nature of gravity, but it still predicts essentially the same things we knew before when it comes to planetary science. However, Einstein&#39;s model told us <em>additional</em> things that Newton never could. He didn&#39;t invalidate Newton&#39;s model, he put it into a more appropriate larger context. Now people are fussing about ever more subtle details regarding dark energy and dark matter. However, the point is that the old models are already proven to work experimentally up to some limitations. The new models will hopefully go beyond those limitations, but they can never overturn experimentally verified predictions of the old model.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The big open question is the nature of quantum gravity. Quantum mechanics exposes important details related to fundamental particles which are not yet settled. However, we absolutely know how gravity works well enough to handle planetary science and orbital mechanics (quantum mechanics is not immediately relevant at all). </p>

<p>I read constantly. If it were so easy to prove it would not even be a question. Now there is disinfo related to this topic, but people question it because they are suspicious. Btw Im not even convinced the earth is flat, but I am not convinced it is not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating ideas. In your first link, there’s a single scientist, a Mr Verlinde, who has thoughts and ideas regarding what gravity is, and I find them very compelling—still, it’s not even a theory (because a theory has had significant experimentation and verification already to get to that point) it’s simply a hypothesis. I’d love to see someone who knows what they’re doing examine this concept and try to prove it</p>
