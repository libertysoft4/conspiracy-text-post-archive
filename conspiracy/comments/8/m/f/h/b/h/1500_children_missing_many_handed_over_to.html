<p>I’ve been thinking about this all day. It was barely talked about in this sub. Where the fuck are all the pizzagaters? Yesterday there was two pizzagate posts that hit the top, no mention of ICE losing these kids.  Where is the outrage? This is a fucking crime. </p>

<p>The pedogate people don’t care because it’s ICE, Trump’s gestapo.  If Hillary was president and this happened it would be plastered all over this sub and the_donald. </p>

<p>The media is complicit too. They’ve talked about it for a little bit, but since they’re attention spans are so fucking tiny, this crime will be forgotten about. I feel like the only reason why they care is because Trump is president. </p>

<p>This should be huge, but nope it’s gonna be russia russia russia bull shit, and the right won’t care because they’re “illegals”. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its obviously not imediately about paedophilia, but there was also <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ice-dhs-sexual-harassment-abuse-records/">this report</a> revealing thousands of cases of DHS employees sexually abusing immigration detainees between 2010 and 2017. Given Nielsen&#39;s rather non-plussed testimony on the issue a few weeks ago, I think its relatively safe to presume that this is not something DHS is taking seriously. Its sad to say, but I wouldn&#39;t be shocked to see those numbers go up over the next seven year period.</p>

<p>Because that was a fake and ridiculous thing, and this is a real and tragic thing. Forget left/right for a moment—as a society, we should prioritize the abuse of real children over the abuse of fictional children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, you realize many &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; have turned out to be true, right?</p>

<p>This, in itself, was a conspiracy theory, that nobody noticed or theorized about until it was already evident in the public domain.</p>

<p>Also, Pizzagate evolved out of Pedogate, which is basically pizzagate minus the retarded stuff about the pizza parlor.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really find it difficult to believe that powerful people would abuse their power in that way, if they wanted to.</p>

<p>This whole thing where people are trying to turn conspiracies into a political subject, where it&#39;s left vs right is bullshit. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the ones in power who are manipulating it all, and turning us against each other on a massive scale. Meanwhile, they release more and more things for people to argue about, in order to prevent any group of people from actually gathering up enough outrage about any singular issue to cause some real change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Misrepresentations are common from all sides on this issue and the truth is, as usual, multifaceted.  The ACLU represents ICE as being culpable, when from what I can tell it is the Border protection agents interviewing and processing asylum seekers who temporarily separate families when they can&#39;t accertain whether adults traveling with children are relatives.  Followed by the Department of Health and Human Services section working with refugees who place unaccompanied children with sponsors apparently without adequate vetting or follow-up, (which has resulted in at least one instance where 8 children were released to human traffickers who, instead of enrolling the children into school, forced them to work on an egg farm).  This is, in my opinion, most likely due not to a malicious conspiracy but rather an overwhelmed agency with more responsibility than personnel and resources.</p>

<p>I was speaking specifically to comments made in the original thread which effectively stated, &quot;They&#39;re illegals; it&#39;s their fault; who cares.&quot; from a few of the more outspoken pizzagate believers.</p>

<p>I think we have to be careful about applying the words of a few to any group of people. Can you be sure those people truly represent whatever &#39;pizzagate believers&#39; means? and why would you think that those who believe that children are trafficked for ritualized abuse/murder might be fighting against the idea of Border patrol being a source of children to traffic? They are pushing the same direction; that&#39;s why I showed you the tweets of Trump and others in support of what you say. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not as divisive as you are making it out to be. Is that responsible of you?</p>

Previously, these agencies were involved in committing the crimes they are tasked to investigate.  That is a conflict of interest. Why would the FBI investigate itself for trafficking children? Why would the FBI investigate the CIA for trafficking children.  You have not watched Conspiracy of Silence, so you do not understand what I mean.   </p>

<p>Missing Children in America: Unsolved Cases:  </p>

<p>&quot;According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, roughly 800,000 children are reported missing each year in the United States -- that&#39;s roughly 2,000 per day. Of those, there are 115 child &quot;stranger abduction&quot; cases each year, which means the child was taken by an unknown person.&quot;   </p>

<p>&quot;Video Lecture by Ted L. Gunderson
Recorded  on July 7, 1999, Garden Grove, California
<a href="http://educate-yourself.og/tg/tgsatanicultsmissingchildrenvideo.shtml">http://educate-yourself.og/tg/tgsatanicultsmissingchildrenvideo.shtml</a> </p>

<p>This video was recorded at the first lecture I ever attended by Ted Gunderson on July 7, 1999 at the Freedom Forum in Garden Grove, California. At the time, I wasn&#39;t aware of the extent and pervasiveness of satanic ritual abuse among powerfully connected, wealthy, and prominent individuals in this country and the incredible number of children that are snatched from American streets and never heard from again. <strong>In Phil Schneider&#39;s last video lecture (1995), Phil alluded to the fact that over 700,000 kids are reported missing every year and never found again. The actual figure is closer to one million missing American children that go unaccounted for every year. Ted points out that the FBI maintains all kinds of statistics on stolen cars, but steadfastly refuses to list missing children in their statistics (does that tell you anything?).</strong> The voluminous documentation and testimonies of victims described in The Franklin Coverup, by attorney John De Camp (Nebraska), leave no question that the FBI themselves are a major player in the coverup of missing and abused young children by prominent politicians and powerful  individuals in this country.  </p>

<p>Ted Gunderson retired from the FBI  in 1979 with honors after 29 years of lauded service. He had risen to the position of Special Agent in Charge and at the time of his retirement and had under his command over 700 FBI agents in the greater Los Angeles area. He became exposed to the world of satanic abuse after retiring and becoming a private investigator. He became interested in the mysterious case, featured on Unsolved Mysteries, of  Dr. Jeffrey McDonald, a Fort Bragg Army physician who was accused and convicted of murdering his wife and three young children in a viscious bloodbath that took place at his home in the early 1970&#39;s. The murder scene included satanic symbols scrawled everywhere with the victims&#39; blood. He was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences. Ted discovered irrefutable proof, including the confession of one of the satanic cult members who were, in fact, responsible for the murders, that McDonald was innocent and was being framed for the murders to cover up the trail of investigation that would have eventually led to McDonald&#39;s discovery of evidence at the hospital where he worked, that drugs were being shipped inside body bags and body cavities from Vietnam along with a huge CIA drug distrbution operation out of Ft. Bragg, North Carolina.  </p>

<p>This lecture includes a short video segment that Ted obtained from the FBI of an actual satanic blood ritual. Satanic activity is endemic and very widespread in this country and needs to be exposed and stopped. This information is sobering and should not be viewed by children.&quot;  </p>

<p>Your allegation means every 10 years, 1 million people disappear without a trace, that&#39;s .3% of the population of the US and like 1% all children. That&#39;s ridiculous. These huge numbers simply don&#39;t make sense. </p>

It&#39;s not new to the Trump administration. It&#39;s been happening for a while.  Just because news suddenly does a story and twists it to smear Trump, people are suddenly up in arms. Research about this in the Obama years. How many children  did he allow to come into our country alone?  They were then just handed off to other immigrants that were not related in many instances.

    <div class="md"><p>Dudette. lol. Sorry. I get upset when it comes to this subject. We&#39;ve been doing jumping jacks trying to get the attention of main stream America over these missing children. They&#39;re being taken from our system and other countries. Most of them brown. Missing immigrant unacompanied minors and children in the DHS system.  This is not new. It&#39;s been happening for years if you look into it. There needs to be public outcry. Please do make all the noise you want, but don&#39;t blame Trump, because he&#39;s trying to stop all this. Look at the arrests and the EO for human trafficking. Look at past POTUS on the same issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is arguing that the US should not have an immigration or customs enforcement branch. There is no getting through to you, but people reading might be misled by your words. </p>

<p>The missing kids were not deported. Any reasonable person would agree that once the kids were placed back in the custody of the foreign government that the US government no longer has responsibility for them. What your cult-like devotion seems to have prevented you from groking is that the US government took custody of these children from their parents, and then lost them. Like they have no fucking clue where they went and can&#39;t explain it to us. They don&#39;t have a receipt telling us they were deported, then they wouldn&#39;t be lost. </p>

<p>What this exposes is a clear disregard for the health and safety of children. And for a crowd that yelled about a conspiracy against children that has not yet been proven, any reasonable person is going to see that such people have only selective partisan outrage. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what random people on the internet should do about it, but this was a failure of the US government to protect children that it had taken into its custody and then lost track of. This had not happened in the past. If they were deported, they should be able to show that is what happened. Otherwise we have no idea what happened, and we don&#39;t know if they were trafficked or not. It is a legitimate concern, and it is super gross of you to demand we prove they weren&#39;t before we can raise the possibility. It shows you don&#39;t really give a shit about kids. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That guy literally said he wanted to abolish ICE... It really showed how shallow his knowledge on the topic was for them to assume all ICE does is round up ilegals. So your wrong, not &quot;nobody.&quot;</p>

<p>So &quot;they have no clue where they went&quot; and you&#39;re assuming they&#39;re being trafficked??? what a conspiracy theory! The Washington post says they &quot;could&quot; be, that sounds like speculation. 
They also said &quot;From last October to the end of the year, officials at the agency’s Office of Refugee Resettlement tried to reach 7,635 children and their sponsors, Mr. Wagner testified. From these calls, officials learned that 6,075 children remained with their sponsors. Twenty-eight had run away, five had been removed from the United States and 52 had relocated to live with a nonsponsor.&quot;
So what if the sponsor moved or changed their phone number? Or what if they tried to cross the border again and made it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one said that. What they are saying is you are more concerned with the reactions of Trump supporters and what conspiracy theory related news article garner the most attention.</p>

<p>They (we) find it humorous that instead of focusing on getting to the truth you would rather focus on how Trump supporters got amped up over pizzagate and created evidence in an attempt to justify what they already believed (instead of being critically thinking, focusing on the evidence, and not jumping to conclusions.) You point out the confirmation bias with pizzagate, which is fine. </p>

<p>What we find funny is how you make these statements about confirmation during the pizzagate scandal, especially within thedonald community while ignoring the confirmation bias that you are presenting at this very moment.</p>

<p>You have very little evidence to support your statements (some of which have already been critically analyzed and debunked by other users.) You care about the facts (and the kids) just as much as thedonald users during pizzagate. You are using this information solely to attack what you feel is unfair media bias. Your confirmation bias is one thing. (It&#39;s commonplace within the conspiracy community) what is annoying and funny is how hypocritical you are about it and even more importantly is how high of a horse you ride. You are so much more intelligent and critically thinking than thedonald users, while making the exact same logical mistakes they do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>[The new policy has seen about 700 children separated from their parents since October, and the problem is only getting worse. A HuffPost report shows that the O.R.R. is already struggling with the number of refugees in its custody, and has struggled to keep track of where many of them have been placed. The office has already lost about 1,500 children, a Health and Human Services official revealed last month:</p>

<p>Until recently, families that illegally crossed together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But as of this month, the Trump administration is following a blanket policy of referring for prosecution all people who cross illegally. The change means that authorities send parents to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Services and their children wind up in the same agency as minors who came to the U.S. without their parents ― sometimes without their parents being able to locate them.](<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/trump-blames-his-own-child-separation-policy-on-democrats">https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/trump-blames-his-own-child-separation-policy-on-democrats</a>)</p>

<p>&quot;I want to be clear. DHS does not have a blanket policy on separating families as a deterrent,&quot; said Thomas Homan, deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. &quot;There is no new policy. This has always been the policy. But you will see more prosecutions because of the commitment to zero tolerance&quot; of illegal border entries.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been upset and angry about AZ for a while now, this is definitely part of it. </p>

<p>Arpaio was known not to even respond to cases of child abuse or endangerment, that together with the david mckay situation, the fox is guarding the henhouse and it&#39;s scary.  </p>

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/conspiracy/@mindhawk/arizona-child-protective-services-appears-completely-corrupt">https://steemit.com/conspiracy/@mindhawk/arizona-child-protective-services-appears-completely-corrupt</a></p>

<p>Let me know what you think, I have spent a lot of time and taken some risk on this.  To write about people like frodsham you take two risks, he&#39;s obviously connected to a network powerful enough to shut down a wider investigation, and you come under scrutiny for someone who might have been part of their network trying to see if you are in danger of prosecution yourself.  </p>

<p>Independent investiagion can be dicey but if I see evidence of child t rafficking and/or abuse I&#39;m not going to shut up about it.  </p>

<p>And there is evidence for child trafficking and abuse.   Lori Handrahan, also key information.  </p>

<p>So we are out here, but it&#39;s very difficult getting this message amplified as there is so much negativity and chaos around the pgate topic, it&#39;s sometimes difficult for the best evidence to get through the noise.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See my other comment and read the article, but David McKay was in charge of investigating foster parents for background checks and in general.  </p>

<p>A young girl Devani was boiled alive.  The foster mother who filled a rubbermaid with boiling water, placed a 4(i think) year old girl in it then ddidn&#39;t call the ambulance for 5 hours.   Samantha Osteras was known by her entire family to have serious mental issues and investigators were told this, yet still given a child who was coming from yet another abuser&#39;s house, David Frodsham.   </p>

<p>David Frodsham was another person who had been reported to be unfit for foster parenting and no investigation by David McKay was done.  The newspaper says he worked at the local military base, but he was actually an officer in charge of computer networks and at least one other soldier at the base was arrested for some wierd parties where young children were being offered like party favors.  </p>

<p>David McKay, who ignored all the signs of this abuse, is now head of the entire Arizona child safety division after a full reorganization and there is absolutely no oversight by any government or any newspaper and this entire Devani/Osteras/Frodsham evente is being erased like it never happened.  </p>

<p>Yet I post on reddit and steemit, no views, no interest, then this 1500 missing children thing, and I&#39;m like, this is all connected, ICE is the same type of system, no oversight and the huge state of arizona in which for kids to disappear forever.  </p>

<p>Very scary, this is more obvious and verifiable a conspiracy than 90% of what is on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> yet why am I the only one putting all these pieces together?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cannot believe I was once a Trump supporter. While I myself share some concern over the concepts of mass migration and illegal immigration under the current political climate, if I knew shit was gonna get this fucking bad I would&#39;ve never supported him. I was skeptical of him when I saw him speak negatively of Snowden, then pulling out of the Iran deal and then going back on his promise to end Syrian intervention. I thought this guy was the fucking guy, the one to drain the swamp (I am cringing right now just typing that phrase), but no. Anti-corruption campaigns, existing power and wealth, this is the kind of shit Putin did to gain power (and now Mohammad Bin Salman and Xi Jinping), Trump even went as far as complementing Xi Jinping for his decision to end term limits in China. When the lefties were saying he was like a dictator, they weren&#39;t fucking kidding.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t believe Trump is going to become one, even with a full two terms, however there are six more years and a lot of unexpected shit has happened in just two. So we&#39;ll have to see how shit unfolds, I dread the day we reach 2024.</p>

<p>pulling out of the Iran deal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>THIS was the eye opener before the election that should have woke everyone. The Iran deal was a thorn in the side of the establishment Republican PNAC plan to attack most Middle East nations. Donald Trump literally told us that he would bring back PNAC and, thanks to a flood of LARPers into r/conspiracy, people were fooled.</p>

<p>Congratulations on waking up. You are not alone.</p>

<p>A few theories:</p>

<p>1) Pizzagaters don&#39;t actually care about missing kids and only claim to be outraged because of political reasons</p>

<p>2) Pizzagaters DO care about kids, but only white / American / legal kids (so they don&#39;t REALLY care about kids in general, just a subset of kids)</p>

<p>3) Pizzagaters think illegal kids deserve whatever they get (so again, they don&#39;t REALLY care about kids)</p>

<p>All of these government agencies have been infiltrated by New World globalists.  At the top, these people tend to be Satanists and Luciferians.  Some of their rituals involve sex with children, ritually sacrificing them, and worse.   </p>

<p>You say it should be huge, but what about the other 500,000+ children that go missing each year in America?  </p>

<p>Russia banned the adoption of Russian children in the U.S. Because the children were being abused.  There is a video of Putin calling out the Satanists who rule the West.   You are aware of this, right?  </p>

<p>That is the reason behind the r/greatawakening sub.   It is to make more people aware of the &quot;rulers and authorities&quot;.  They have been doing these things for thousands of years.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my fourth username. Why? Because the rest are banned for talking about pizzagate! Of course no one is speaking up, you censored us all, you pedophile mod fucks! We all screamed this and no one took our side.</p>

<p>Silence means you took mods side. Silence means compliance. Thank yourselves for running the pizzagate truthers to other platforms or for silencing them altogether. I&#39;ve been banned here, news, politics, washington sub, california sub, twitter, Facebook. </p>

<p>The only place where it&#39;s been fine to discuss pizzagate is on voat, sometimes the chans, and with the Q people. That&#39;s it. Everywhere else? NOPE. SHADOW BAN!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say Pizzagaters won&#39;t care because they&#39;re illegals, yet the main focus has been about foreign children. So you&#39;re wrong there.</p>

<p>You ask where is the outrage? Where are the Pizzagaters? They&#39;ve been outraged about this stuff for the past two years. The fact you criticize them now suggests you&#39;ve probably been mocking them all that time, now you have the nerve to accuse them of not caring? Fuck you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Most got here legally&quot; is a poor argument at best. It just shows agency incompetance and dos not justify building a deterrant to keep more from walking in. I spent many hours with the minuteman project in Arizona years ago, and the hundreds we spotted crossing nightly were not visa packing schoolkids. They were dope mules mostly. We could do nothing but report locations and number of peoples. Could not even let them know we were there. Buerocracy bullshit. Completely undermanned border security and the democrats refused to add funding for more agents. Building the wall crewtes less demand for agents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I got was the headline. I don&#39;t think children should be separated from their parents. They should all be sent back. I would like to know what the reasoning is behind it. I would like to hear from the parents. They should have recourse through the legal system. If any child was taken from their parents and not returned that should be treated as kidnapping and the individuals involved treated as kidnappers. </p>

<p>The parents should go to their embassy in Mexico and seek assistance there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of seems to me like this story is overblown.  The kids aren&#39;t necessarily missing, federal DHS just has no record of their whereabouts.  When UACs are placed with sponsors, though, they cease to be wards of the federal government.  It seems to me it would be the responsibility of the state governments at that point.  Why are we surprised that the federal government isn&#39;t keeping track of the whereabouts of children no longer in their care?  Maybe the argument is they should be in the federal government&#39;s care longer, but I don&#39;t really hear anyone making that argument.  Just freaking out about this story like the federal government dropped 1400 kids off at soccer practice and forgot to pick them up or something. 
As for the human trafficking thing, uh I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s nothing at all that indicates that is occuring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only heard about it because I found a pretty random link to a random un-credible article about devani.  </p>

<p>A young girl boiled alive by a woman who should never have been a foster parent as her brother reported her as someone who had mental issues.   </p>

<p>So a young girl was taken from a known abuser who went to prison, given to an insane woman, boiled to death in a rubbermaid bin, and the insane woman is not arrested for several days, and when she goes to prison is let out after a few weeks due to intense beatings at the hands of the other inmates.    So you kill a child under your care by inexplicably boiling them alive then not calling the ambulance for 5 hours?   I think she served 2 months in prison.  </p>

<p>This is just what got me looking at the story, it gets worse, and worse and worse, and the 1500 missing kids through immigration is partially in this same area.  It is systemic.  Someone in the system is profiting off the sale of the kids from the system to the black market.  Only answer to fit these facts.   </p>

<p>And the press at AZCentral or whatever is barely capable of correctly reporting a high school soccer game.  I called Mary Jo Pitzl on the phone and it was like talking with a bag of rocks.  They got a 3 year grant to investigate, not a single proper question got asked and instead all these fluff human interest stories come out that doesn&#39;t even mention devani.  </p>

<p>And the guy who was supposed to be investigating peoples background to see if they are appropriate foster parents?  The one who heard the brother warn that this woman was crazy?   </p>

<p>Now the head of the child services department, David McKay.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually just a gross misuse/misunderstanding of numbers resulting from multiple completely different variables . The government does track the children via “Alien” numbers paired with the adult they crossed with, and they’re given due process, just like every adult, to go through the immigration court system.  What all these posts, and the article, fail to actually address is WHY the location is unknown: the family members they go live with...move. Either to a different address when their “sponsors” move, or they want to stop sleeping in living rooms and get an apartment of their own once they find work. </p>

<p>If they move to a different apartment number, even in the same complex, and don’t submit an EOIR-33 form with the nearest immigration court in a mailed letter...poof...their location is officially unknown.  Think of how many times these families move, it’s a ton.</p>

<p>It’s a whole lot less sinister in reality isn’t it? These articles are nothing more than sensationalizing political propaganda. </p>

<p>The Muh Russia crowd of organized brigaders has a new &quot;angle&quot; they want us to absorb....</p>

<p>&quot;Did you know that Trump is responsible for these missing kids? Yup, we (pretend conspiracicsts) are all upset about this,  but pizzagaters will do anything to cover up his crimes&quot;</p>

<p>ROFLMAO</p>

<p>The contrived nature of this new scripted &quot;outrage&quot; from the group of people infiltrating this sub is hilarious and transparent as fuck. </p>

The one thing I don&#39;t agree with though, is that I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a higher up orchestrating this. Sadly, I think it&#39;s just ice abusing power.

    <div class="md"><p>SS:  In 2015 Sen. Rob Portman of the US Permanent Subcommittee of Investigations for the Oversight of the HHS and DHS learned of eight Guatemalan children, unaccompanied alien children, that crossed our border illegally via traffickers their parents had paid.  These children were given over to the HHS department for supervision; however the HHS returned these children back to the traffickers.  After meetings and testimonies and circle jerks, calls were made and it was determined in 2016 that no one knows where over 1,400 unaccompanied illegal children were placed by the HHS.</p>

<p>This issue did NOT originate under the Trump administration.  The beginning of this investigation began under Obama.  I am sure the issue began a longggg time ago.  It has been those under the Trump administration that has attempted to locate those children placed under Obama&#39;s watch.  </p>

<p>Please stop looking to MSM as your source for news.  Vanity Fair as a source? Wtf? Who are you people.  This link shares the remarks of the committee chair for the investigation by the Federal Government.   Do yourselves a favor and begin forming your opinions from the actual source.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. First the government rips these kids from their parents for bullshit&quot;reasons&quot; and deport their parents separately. Now they&#39;ve &quot;lost&quot; this many of them and just throw their hands up and say &quot;Oh well!&quot;.</p>

<p>Although, every year we have a lot of kids go missing from our foster care system as well. And they&#39;re legally not required to report them as missing. Because &quot;protecting the kids information&quot; or some bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am posting these links here because a lot of people commenting have no idea about what is going on.  1500 missing children is a tragedy, and it needs to be resolved, but there are over 500,000+ children reported missing in the U.S. alone.  I hear there are over 7M reported missing worldwide each year.  </p>

<p>I have not researched the leadership of the ICE, and the changes that have been made since Trump came into office.  I suspect that the ICE was infiltrated by New World Order globalists, who tend to be Satanists and Luciferians.  They like to use children for sex and certain rituals, so I suspect that is what happened to these children.  </p>

<p>OP asks where is the public outcry.  That is a great question.  Why is the real story behind the missing 1500 children not being reported by the MSM?  Why have the stories below been quashed by the media and law enforcement?  </p>

Quite simple to understand without a preconceived notion. And an actual willingness to look into the propaganda machine that is our media. Because it’s all related. Countless people apart of the leftist media just started sharing these photos relating to this story the other day. “Caged immigrant children are what the trump regime stands for” CNN MSNBC HuffPo, you name it. They thought it was somehow a new picture and too quickly jumped at this new opportunity to attack trump. The whistleblower behind this story has now been able to connect with federal agencies that had swiped this under the rug since 15’. It was under obama which this happened and I’m guessing some disruptions in his still lasting bureaucracy’s are soon to follow </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dudette. lol. Sorry. I get upset when it comes to this subject. We&#39;ve been doing jumping jacks trying to get the attention of main stream America over these missing children. They&#39;re being taken from our system and other countries. Most of them brown. Missing immigrant unacompanied minors and children in the DHS system.  This is not new. It&#39;s been happening for years if you look into it. There needs to be public outcry. Please do make all the noise you want, but don&#39;t blame Trump, because he&#39;s trying to stop all this. Look at the arrests and the EO for human trafficking. Look at past POTUS on the same issue. </p>

<p>&quot;Video Lecture by Ted L. Gunderson
Recorded  on July 7, 1999, Garden Grove, California
<a href="http://educate-yourself.og/tg/tgsatanicultsmissingchildrenvideo.shtml">http://educate-yourself.og/tg/tgsatanicultsmissingchildrenvideo.shtml</a> </p>

<p>This video was recorded at the first lecture I ever attended by Ted Gunderson on July 7, 1999 at the Freedom Forum in Garden Grove, California. At the time, I wasn&#39;t aware of the extent and pervasiveness of satanic ritual abuse among powerfully connected, wealthy, and prominent individuals in this country and the incredible number of children that are snatched from American streets and never heard from again. <strong>In Phil Schneider&#39;s last video lecture (1995), Phil alluded to the fact that over 700,000 kids are reported missing every year and never found again. The actual figure is closer to one million missing American children that go unaccounted for every year. Ted points out that the FBI maintains all kinds of statistics on stolen cars, but steadfastly refuses to list missing children in their statistics (does that tell you anything?).</strong> The voluminous documentation and testimonies of victims described in The Franklin Coverup, by attorney John De Camp (Nebraska), leave no question that the FBI themselves are a major player in the coverup of missing and abused young children by prominent politicians and powerful  individuals in this country.  </p>

<p>Ted Gunderson retired from the FBI  in 1979 with honors after 29 years of lauded service. He had risen to the position of Special Agent in Charge and at the time of his retirement and had under his command over 700 FBI agents in the greater Los Angeles area. He became exposed to the world of satanic abuse after retiring and becoming a private investigator. He became interested in the mysterious case, featured on Unsolved Mysteries, of  Dr. Jeffrey McDonald, a Fort Bragg Army physician who was accused and convicted of murdering his wife and three young children in a viscious bloodbath that took place at his home in the early 1970&#39;s. The murder scene included satanic symbols scrawled everywhere with the victims&#39; blood. He was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences. Ted discovered irrefutable proof, including the confession of one of the satanic cult members who were, in fact, responsible for the murders, that McDonald was innocent and was being framed for the murders to cover up the trail of investigation that would have eventually led to McDonald&#39;s discovery of evidence at the hospital where he worked, that drugs were being shipped inside body bags and body cavities from Vietnam along with a huge CIA drug distrbution operation out of Ft. Bragg, North Carolina.  </p>

<p>This lecture includes a short video segment that Ted obtained from the FBI of an actual satanic blood ritual. Satanic activity is endemic and very widespread in this country and needs to be exposed and stopped. This information is sobering and should not be viewed by children.&quot;  </p>
