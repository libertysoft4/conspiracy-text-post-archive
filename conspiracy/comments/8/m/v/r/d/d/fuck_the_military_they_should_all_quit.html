    <div class="md"><p>I feel like you’re a bit too cynical. The standing army was created over a thousand years ago as a deterrent against invasion. Sure right now the US isn’t in open global conflict but they weren’t in on December 1, 1942, a couple days before Japan attacked pearl harbour. And with the instability in the world right now you really think North Korea wouldn’t attack your US if you didn’t have an army? Or they Russia wouldn’t? The standing army is recognized as a cornerstone in the evolution of civilization. It’s an insurance policy and if it’s giving young men and women work then let them. They know the risks why do you care? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The past four people I’ve met who served were doing so because of school. One was in debt and joined to get it paid off so he could return to college. The other three did it from the start in order to go to college with out taking out loans. </p>

<p>Imo, I think a majority of the current generation joins for the free college. Although it is arguably not free at all. Which brings me to my next point, college is also a scam. Force everyone to go to college in order to get a decent job. Sure, you can get a decent job with out college but that require either a lot of dedication and work, or luck through connections. Everyone is told for their entire K-12 life that you’ll end up working at wal-mart or McDonald’s if you don’t go to college. People from a wealthy family might not stress that because their family will pay for it. Some kids will perform well in school and get scholarships/grants/etc. Others will only have the choice of taking on massive debt or joining the military. </p>

<p>There are so many jobs out there that want you to have a degree, but in all honesty could be performed fine by someone with out one. Society forces you to have a degree to sit in an office and do menial tasks for mediocre money. Sure you could go to a trade school and learn to work some shitty job like welding for decent money, but who the fuck honestly wants to do that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you 100%.  I feel so disturbed about the rhetoric that is spewed to the youth of really any country that doesn&#39;t have paid education.  if you take all the kids who did the right thing, the thing told to them by their parents and their own governments, they did the right thing.  they went to school, they got good grades.  they graduated and then what?  then what?  they got fucked.  no jobs, no nothing but debt.  the whole thing was a very complex and extensive scam against the people who &quot;did the right thing&quot;.  that is wrong.  that is so wrong.  everyone gets fucked and scammed in life at some point, but it most definitely should not be right after you accomplished goals you were supposed to accomplish and not after you accumulated a massive amount of debt by doing so.  the youth, across the globe have been shat on and taken advantage of i the worst way.  their futures were robbed of them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like fund allocation for education is important but not as expensive for research and design to keep the soldiers safer with protection and weapons. Makes sense.. just takes food, shelter and already trained instructors to teach skills.. takes a lot more money to let’s say build newer missiles to make sure we can shoot down incoming missiles from other countries.. very vague response but it’s just a lot more expensive to pay for the logistics of keeping up in the arms race versus training and teacher soldiers skills </p>

<p>Not all people even see combat. One of my roommates in college did 4 years, was stationed in South Korea for a little bit, and afterwards, his college education was 100% paid for and he had no plans of going back in. Good deal if you ask me.</p>

<p>You should be thankful for the people who are willing to serve regardless of your opinions of America&#39;s interference in other affairs. Because if it weren&#39;t them, then it&#39;d probably be randomized in the form of a draft or something.</p>
