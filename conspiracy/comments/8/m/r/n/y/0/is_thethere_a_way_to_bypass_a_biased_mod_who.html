I was called antisemitic in even though pro Israel users were literally calling for &quot;bombing Gaza to dust so Israel could rebuild it free of those animals&quot;. I reported these people yet they are still on about killing people. I am a progressive Jew and hate being called antisemitic bc my family is in Israel. I feel this mod is silencing progressive jews so only far right extremist Jews can shill for Israel&#39;s crusade. How do I regain my voice on this hyper controlled Platform?</p>

<p>I was banned for being antisemitic and in that post, it literally says &quot;Saudi Arabia cuts gay mens penis off and lets them bleed to death in the street.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ethnicity is all about the way groups of people identify with each other based on similar language/backgrounds/whatever. You can self-identify as whatever you like, but there&#39;s no guarantee that the ethnic group in question would consider you as a member. </p>

<p>Your question can be expanded to any other ethnic group, but since you asked about Judaism I can give you two examples. Ethiopian Jews had a hard time being accepted as Jewish (ethnically, and even religiously in orthodox wings) in Israel, despite considering themselves ethnically Jewish. A lot of it was due to immigration pressure and vast cultural/lingual differences, but modernly they are fully accepted as Jews (though some of their hardships continue). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hebrew_Israelites">Black Hebrew Israelites</a>, meanwhile, are not considered Jewish despite their claims and intentions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I was posting about Israel giving russia data the mueller is going after. They want it to be only russi a. I also posted links that Obama was running a counter attack on israel after they were caught hacking spying attacking america. Trump had many anti espionage agents after him since he met Netanyahu in 2014 through 2015 leading up to him running for president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would Israel give Russia data that Mueller wants?</p>

<p>Russia backs Iran and Syria and by extension the Palestinians.</p>

<p>Trump is super pro-Israel and his son in law invests millions of dollars into illegal settlements.</p>

<p>Why wouldn’t they just give this super secret intel to Trump?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was US Intel and Intel Israel got while hacking JCPOA. It was israels hack that russia took over in Kaspersky that sort of kicked this off. Democrats were changing foriegn policy in Iran middle east and Ukraine. It benefits Russia to keep Iran sanctioned as they have to sell oil/ gas at a cheaper cost because the demand is low due to sanctions. So both Israel and Russia had a will for this. By opening Iran, they were supplying the EU and buying from the EU which hurts russia and helps their enemy. As for Syria, Russia has stopped helping there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well &quot;Arab&quot; isn&#39;t a religion so it&#39;s quite irrelevant in the line of logical reasoning we are engaging. But for all practical purposes no. Arabs are a Semitic people, which is just a classification of a language group, not a genetic group.</p>
