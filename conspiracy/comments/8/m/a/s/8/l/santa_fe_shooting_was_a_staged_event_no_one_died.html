    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard this same argument for 30 years man. They aren&#39;t taking the fucking guns. Passing more stringent laws does not equal taking away the guns. The whole god damn economy would collapse if they stopped selling a shit load of guns. </p>

<p>Convincing people that value their 2nd amendment rights that they <em>are</em> coming for the guns sure does boost sales though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just as a detective walks on a murder victim, he doesn&#39;t have to surmise right then and there what the motives and methods were, and doesn&#39;t have to determine who benefited to be able to at least conclude that a murder has in fact taken place.</p>

<p>Similarly, I don&#39;t understand the full implications of these events or who specifically is involved in orchestrating them, but these things aren&#39;t necessary to survey the coverage we are given from these events and weigh them in our minds, to see whether they have the 3D appearance or flavor of a real mass shooting, and in my opinion they often do not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the NRA seems to be part of the show. IF they really cared about citizens&#39; gun rights, why have they not filed a lawsuit against the federal government for faking/staging school shootings such as Sandy Hook, Parkland, and now Santa Fe? </p>

<p>We&#39;re supposed to believe no one in the NRA has figured out Sandy Hook was a hoax yet? And that they can&#39;t afford lawyers to make cases for this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You kinda missed the point here. It would make way more sense that if someone was faking shootings, it would be the NRA, not the government. Considering their entire business thrives off the fear of gun owners losing access to guns. And the government hasn&#39;t taken away your guns after an ocean of mass shootings in the past 15 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d think more people would catch on after the last, oh, 25 bullshit drills with fake news reports and zero video or photo proof of a single fucking thing. </p>

<p>This is where I start to believe those people that say that the entire world they live in is a made-up fairy tale lie. I mean, every radio show during the day, even the 247 sports stations, are <em>screaming</em> into the microphones that &quot;something must be done <em>NOW</em>!&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>And, the whole god damn thing is fake. All this shit that&#39;s happening is based on lies and made up facts. BLM and NFL taking knees is all based on fabricated bullshit that all these innocent blacks are getting shot by cops for no reason, when we all know that this is pure bullshit. ALL of those cases had circumstances that exonerated the police in a court of law, with juries and proof, etc. Yet, they are ALL operating under a fake premise that&#39;s a total lie, created by the media and social platforms.</p>

<p>These drills with fake victims and blood are being treated like they are organic real events by the people who run our government and media. So fucking bizarre, and scary. They still bring up sandy hoax, and scream about it like it was real. smh..</p>
