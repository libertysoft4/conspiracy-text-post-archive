        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Summary: The ANC (current govt. of SA) is stealing land off South African farmers, similar how Mugabe and his crooks done in Zimbabwe.</p>

<p><a href="https://mg.co.za/article/2018-05-21-anc-to-use-current-constitution-to-test-land-expropriation-without-compensation">https://mg.co.za/article/2018-05-21-anc-to-use-current-constitution-to-test-land-expropriation-without-compensation</a></p>

<p>President Zuma is pulling a 360* Mugabe on the South-African people.</p>

<p>The land won&#39;t go into the hands of the people, but to the wealthy racists in the ANC and then the people will starve like in Zimbabwe. To counter that the Rand will hyper-inflate like the Zimbabwe dollar did. How anyone isn&#39;t seeing the exact same thing coming like it did in Zimbabwe is just insane.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the &quot;free media&quot; is biased in favor of this thievery.</p>

<p>Long term the white farmers will just move on and the black people will starve. The racist ANC knows this and seems to hate the black people even more than it likes to steal from whites.</p>

<p><em>10000000000 trillion Rand notes coming soon...</em></p>

<p>You know what&#39;s funny ? The Israelis could dismantle their govt. overnight, they were stupid enough to give every conscript guns and training, they just need to get pointed in the right direction.</p>

<p>Israelis themselves get tax-squeezed like a lemon too, but of course they like profiting off the slaughter of the Palestinians, which will lead to collaboration instead of the realization that when the Palestinians are done and dead, the Jews will be the next victim of their own government just as the US. govt. loves killing their own American citizens for example...</p>

<p>Have you noticed what 30 years of &quot;Progressivism&quot; has done to the UK ? Most of Londonistan looks like Iraq 2003, while still charging much £££. Example: Brick Lane 1800 £ a month for what is essentially a toilet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you seriously clinging to the remnants of Rhodesia as argument for why the British Commonwealth should maintain dominance over South Africa (and Southern Africa)?</p>

<p>Zimbabwe is Rhodesia is Boer.  No Effing sh*t they&#39;re requesting to rejoin the Commonwealth.  Zimbabwe IS THE Commonwealth.  They left in name only for a decade or three.</p>

<p>Pointing to another failed colony and blaming the locals is kinda humorous.</p>

<p>Didja know prior to colonization, Africans had almost zero trouble with malaria?  They had mastered how to control it by living in certain sized villages a certain distance from each other village.  Boom, no malaria.</p>

<p>The British Commonwealth comes in, and establishes dense grid cities.  Guess what??  Malaria.  Now Western Pharma can play Big Shot Hero and &quot;help the poor helpless Africans solve their malaria problem.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s the colonizers who are causing the trouble, not the colonized.</p>

<p>Point remains.  Colonizers are out of place.  Should a colonial state crumble, it is not the responsibility or fault of the colonized.  If anything, a crumbled colonizer state is a victory for the colonized.  This does not show their incompetence, but shows their strength as a peoples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea the Zulu&#39;s are the dominant peoples of SE Africa and had to be squashed by the incoming Euros.  The Zulus appear to be unsquishing and ready to re-exert their power.  It&#39;s their land, I have no problem with them exerting their power.</p>

<p>Further, I have zero interest in the moral relativism of who ethnically cleansed the most heinously.</p>

<p>Point stands:  It is not Boer land.  Boers lack the power to hold the land and are on borrowed time.  The presence of the Boers was not and is not some great panacea for the primitive squalor the Zulus lived in.  The Euro colonizers did not save SE Africa.  The Euros wrecked SE Africa and now SE Africans are trying to make it right again.</p>

<p>And yet you&#39;re claiming the Euros are needed to maintain... what exactly?</p>

<p>Speaking the truth will get you bombarded hard. But i&#39;m not afraid. Any subversive activity just gives confirmation that we&#39;re right, an involuntary confession by our enemies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct in part.  A key aspect is the word &quot;retribution.&quot;  That is what is going to command the lower class folks of color to vote democratic during the next presidential race.

<p>OK, then why did you make the Zim rejoining Commonwealth comment?</p>

<p>It read like you were thus signaling the Commonwealth is good for the region and other native blacks are eager to enjoy the continued presence of the Commonwealth, and the natives of SA would do well to look to the natives of Zimbabwe for the right way to deal with colonizing powers.</p>
