        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In 1945 an American astronomer, B.P. Sharpless, issued a finding that Phobos, the larger moon of Mars, was slowly falling out of orbit and in 10-20 million years it eventually would impact the planet. That is a long time in human time, but in cosmic time, it is but a mere second. His findings were met with much skepticism but eventually proved to be basically correct and stand to this day.</p>

<p>In 1966 I.S. Shklovskii, a respected Russian scientist, and Carl Sagan collaborated on a monumental book entitled Intelligent Life in the Universe. In the book Shklovskii recounts his 1959 determinations that Phobos had a “low density.” He wrote: “Could Phobos be indeed rigid, on the outside—but hollow on the inside? A natural satellite cannot be a hollow object. Therefore we are led to the possibility that Phobos and possibly Deimos as well—may be artificial satellites of Mars.”</p>

<p>The younger Sagan added a further view in that book to Shklovskii’s words: “Conceivably, the capture and hollowing of a small asteroid may be technically more feasible than the construction in orbit of an artificial satellite with material brought from the surface.</p>

<p>That early determination of hollowness about Phobos made in 1959 is little known today. Most writings of the voids in Phobos refer to the lower--than-expected--mass findings (comparatively large voids) as coming from innocent and surprising probe measurements made far more recently. That is true about the eventual confirmation by on-the-scene probes, but initially that fact was suspected and calculations discussed back in 1959. One would think that data would have been a very good reason to target Phobos for an intense investigation as the future missions to Mars were being planned. Maybe it was the chief reason for the double Viking missions in the late 1970&#39;s. We are left to wonder if we were lied to about the real reason for those missions.</p>

<p>But that is not all that made the moon a suspect of being intelligently manipulated. The suspicious data was widely known. Its orbit and that of Deimos are directly over the equatorial area of Mars, and both, especially Phobos, orbits very close to the planet. Finally, because of the small size of Mars, astrophysics cannot properly allow how it could have captured not just one but two wayward asteroids and have them eventually develop almost perfectly circular orbits so close to the planet. By any measure, Phobos should have been a prime suspect in a different “search for life” experiment than the one touted as the reason for the missions, that of digging into the Martian dirt for signs of life. It is hard to believe that the outspoken Sagan didn’t point out those discrepancies of the moons from the norm as the missions were being planned. Surely, he would point out the logic of how the confirmation of the intelligent manipulation of asteroidal bodies around the planet would make digging in the Martian soil irrelevant. And probably, Sagan, being Sagan made that point and he was told to not blow the cover for the mission.</p>

<p>Another point never mentioned but as important and indicative as any of the rest in this saga is that Deimos, the more outer companion of Phobos is itself positioned at a not far distance that is only very slightly out of a synchronous orbit with the planet. While Phobos is slowly falling into the planet, Deimos is slowly falling away. That can only mean that at one time millions of years ago that it was in lockstep with the rotation of Mars, just as we learned to do with our communication satellites in the 1960&#39;s.</p>

<p>Allowing for the existence of ancient space-capable civilizations answers most of the things we find puzzling today about Mars. But if we can’t use our intelligence to recognize UFOs for what they seem to be, why should we look beyond what we are told to accept and believe about Mars? Science and government had been fairly open in their quest to investigate the planets of Mars and Venus in general with the Mariner series of probes starting in 1962 their constantly improving data returns begin to send severe shocks throughout science. Mariner 9 returned surprising pictures of Mars and Phobos until October of 1972. Because of misleading earlier images from earlier Mariners, Mariner 9, the final one, showed evidence of vast amounts of erosion that could only be explained by once having surface water in abundance. Even little Phobos gave some interesting surprises of its own.</p>

<p>The Viking project was initiated in 1968 well before the shockingly clear images came down from Mariner 9. The project consisted of two identical missions sent a few months apart. They lifted off in the summer of 1975,.Each comprised of a lander and an orbiter. In each were thirteen investigations. The primary interest to the public if not the scientists was in the “search for life” experiments that would scoop up a bit of Martian soil and test it for signs of life and former life.</p>

<p>The Viking project was very ambitious and a remarkable success. Science would like to have you believe that it was a strictly basic, straightforward exercise in science. That would be true if there were not the bugaboo of flying saucers possibly lurking in every unknown corner of space.</p>

<p>Sagan, an extremely avid UFO believer as an undergraduate student, had by that time learned to hold such views in check and while enthusiastic about life elsewhere in the Universe, was a very out-spoken critic of UFOs here at Earth. It was at his urging that the imaging of Phobos was included in the Mariner 9 schedule. As mentioned earlier, his interest in Phobos dates back at least to 1966. Later, as the Viking experiments were being planned he lobbied to get a lighting installed on the landers to capture any nocturnal creature activity during the Martian nights. But his request was denied due to weight limitations.</p>

<p>NASA and JPL may not have had strong inclinations to believe UFOs came from Mars, but evidence of water erosion found by Mariner 9 increased that possibility. What we know is that up to and including some of the results of the Viking missions the flow of data to the public was almost as quick as to the scientist.</p>

<p>This indicates that at that at the time of the beginning of the Viking missions no Mars’ conspiracy seemed to be at play. That then is a further indication that the Viking mission images of Phobos were an unexpected breakthrough that revealed too much and had to be concealed after the fact. How to do handle that belatedly? First, some official actions must be put into place, and second, a diversion to draw attention elsewhere. What we do know is that in 1992 NASA contracted with Michael Malin, formerly of JPL. Evidently with contacts within the agencies involved, he created his own company which was given exclusive rights over imaging and management of all photographs taken by the Mars Observer probe, the follow up to the Viking mission.. His contract allowed him to release or withhold images as he saw fit.</p>

<p>(We must wonder if Sagan was quickly aware of what the Phobos images revealed, highly excited about the discovery, but subsequently crushed when the secrecy descended across the field and prevented him and his fellow scientists from working with that historical knowledge.)</p>

<p>Most people remember the hullabaloo made over the supposed “Face on Mars” and supposed pyramids at Cydonia. They were a magnet to those interested in the strange aspects of the Viking images Mars. With a view in mind of a Mars’ conspiracy, we should wonder, was it a sham show, a misdirection ploy beaten into a froth by a center-stage character to draw interest away from the more revealing data from the Vikings? (I was there, an avid /Mars/UFOer, and I couldn’t understand the amount of hype.) It was a clamorous, long, loud and detailed affair that went into ridiculous extremes of supposed data and arguments.</p>

<p>The “search for life” experiments showed some promise, but the results was not as expected and therefore deemed inconclusive by TPTB. That finding is still challenged by Gilbert Levin the designer of the module. As far as the public was concerned the negative finding virtually ended any popular concepts about Martians living or long dead.</p>

<p>What we do know is that in 1992 NASA contracted with Michael Malin, formerly of JPL and evidently with contacts within the agencies involved, he created his own company which was given exclusive rights over imaging and management of all photographs taken by the Mars Observer probe, the follow up to the Viking mission. His contract allowed him to release or withhold images as he personally saw fit. Gone were the days when Sagan and associates would stand by the printer impatiently waiting for it to download images directly to them and eventually into the public’s hands.</p>

<p>But the lack of due diligence had done its damage. The twin Viking orbiters had taken thousands of images of Phobos from all positions around the tiny moon, and they were released without NASA or JPL being aware of what they revealed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of increasing interest are the two unmanned crafts sent to Mars, Phobos, Deimos by the Russians. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_program">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_program</a></p>

<p>What wiki says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Phobos 1 was launched on 7 July 1988, and Phobos 2 on 12 July 1988, each aboard a Proton-K rocket.</p>

<p>Phobos 1 suffered a terminal failure en route to Mars. Phobos 2 attained Mars orbit, but contact was lost before the final phase, prior to deployment of a planned Phobos lander.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What potentially really happened to Phobos 1 and Phobos 2?   Here are some more mysterious details around Phobos 2 from <a href="http://www.ufocasebook.com/phobos2.html:">http://www.ufocasebook.com/phobos2.html:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mission was flawless until the craft aligned itself with the moon. 
 <strong>On March 28, 1989 an elliptical object was detected moving towards the satellite seconds before it failed.</strong></p>

<p>On March 28, 1989 Tass, the official Soviet news agency stated: &quot;Phobos II failed to communicate with Earth as scheduled after completing an operation yesterday around the Martian moon Phobos. Scientists at mission control have been unable to establish stable radio contact.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Phobos 2 Captured Strange Photos of Mars Before Losing Contact With Its Base.&quot; Vremya revealed yesterday that the space probe Phobos II, which was orbiting above Mars when Soviet scientists lost contact with it on Monday, had photographed an UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT on the Martian surface seconds before losing contact.&quot; Scientists described the UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT as a thin ellipse 20 KILOMETERS LONG! It was further stated that the photos could not be an illusion because it was captured by 2 different color cameras as well as cameras taking infrared shots. One controller at the Kaliningrad control center concluded that the probe was now spinning out of control. It would seem that something struck or shot the Phobos II Probe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the two photos of interest:</p>

<p><a href="http://forgetomori.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/phobos_last.jpg">Phobos with &quot;large cigar-shaped UFO&quot;</a></p>

<p>As to present both sides, here&#39;s some one debunking the two photographs (one as an artifact from photography, the other as the actual shadow of Phobos).  <a href="http://forgetomori.com/2009/ufos/phobos-2-a-bloody-soviet-close-encounter/">http://forgetomori.com/2009/ufos/phobos-2-a-bloody-soviet-close-encounter/</a></p>

John E. Brandenburg is a plasma physicist who went somewhat off the rails in 2012 and started proclaiming that he saw clear evidence of a thermonuclear war on Mars in the distant past. This off-beat idea attracted the attention of woo-peddlars and gave a mighty boost to sales of his books.  His submissions have not been accepted by peer-reviewed journals. J. Cosmology doesn&#39;t count.</p>

<p>No it didn&#39;t, well at least not the real one that actually carries scientific merit.</p>

<p><em>Uppsala University in Sweden, with approval from Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, gives out the Angstrom Prize, which includes a medal and a cash award, given in the honor of 18th Century Swedish scientist Anders-Jonas Angstrom. Hoagland&#39;s medal, however, came from the separate Angstrom Foundation Aktiebolag (AFAB). This is a privately-owned company with no connection to Uppsala University or the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.</em></p>

<p><em>There were no scientists involved in that decision,&quot; said Ralph Greenberg, a professor of mathematics at the University of Washington. Others who have researched Hoagland&#39;s medal say it carries little if any merit and was not awarded by scientists or a scientific organization.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s an idea. The combined mass of the asteroid belt is only around 4% of the moon. That essentially means that if it was a planet at some point, then most of it&#39;s mass would have been flung out, with a tiny bit staying behind to form the asteroid belt. We&#39;d then need to explain what mechanism made this happen.</p>

<p>What is far more likely is that the asteroid belt is not the remnants of a planet. It is much more likely that the generally accepted theory of it being part of the solar nebula which did not accrete into a planetissimal is in fact true, and not a big conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean apart from the ones that do right? ;)</p>

<p>I have a 3 year old (2015 edition) textbook written by the Cambridge University press, which goes into detail about the gravitational accretion model. </p>

<p>Unless something has changed in the past 6 months when I was issued said textbook then I am calling your bluff.</p>

<p>I trust Cambridge University over a random internet dude.</p>

<p>Seriously though, can I get a link to the peer reviewed paper? Genuinely interested and have enough to do what with revising for my Planetary Science exam in 2 weeks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enlighten me. If Jounals do not publish anything valuable, then where is the &quot;real&quot; science published?</p>

<p>Or are you suggesting that the entire basis of science (that of peer review) is wrong as well?</p>

<p>After all, you are suggesting that one of the most celebrated and prestigious universities in the world published a textbook that no one uses, and is also completely wrong.</p>

<p>I did a search for these 1000s of papers using your exact keywords (that aren&#39;t valuable according to your previous sentence!), and guess what? Not quite 1000&#39;s.  Just 6 actually. None of which even mention planetary formation, but instead refer to the formation of low mass stars and sub stellar objects. 
This was using my university&#39;s library which has access to every peer reviewed journal.  </p>

<p>Seems to me you are full of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unrelated to your flat earth comment but Doppler Redshift is fake science designed to prop up Big Bang Creationism. Redshift, does exist but it has nothing to do with Doppler.</p>

<p>The Doppler effect is an observer and time dependent phenomenon, you have to listen for several seconds to observe Doppler. Redshift can be observed in no time flat because it is not a Doppler effect and it is not evidence of expansion, in fact it is in actuality evidence of electrostatic plasma filled universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After going through the first album, I feel like I&#39;m looking at the result of some major cataclysmic event.</p>

<p>Like...ALL life on the planet was destroyed. All structures, all people, <em>everything</em> was just completely wiped out.</p>

<p>Something bigger than an asteroid or planet-wide nukes. I&#39;m saying something like a collision with another planet or something. Maybe Olympus Mons blew its lid and covered most of the planet in molten death. The inhabitants, at the time, could have been far more advanced than us and maybe they had the means to send life into orbit around Mars (the OP) as well as identify Earth as a safe haven and then migrate here. I&#39;ve heard it before, but maybe we <em>are</em> the martians.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it makes for a great story. Really nothing more than that; wild speculation. There&#39;s no proof of anything. Just a lot of odd looking Fallout-themed images from Mars. I know geometry like squares and triangles can occur in nature, but there&#39;s so much to look at in those pictures...it really makes you wonder.</p>

Since they were disconnected from the Source (they had no compassion or love at all) so they fighted nonstop and finally they blown up their own atmosphere.
Some souls reincarnated here and since then they are trying to gain total control over the planet (part of the N.W.O)
There are some CIA documents that talk about astral journeys to Mars to find about this stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone else notice a weird trend of posts which will have a paragraph completely duplicated within it?</p>

<p>What we do know is that in 1992 NASA contracted with Michael Malin, formerly of JPL and evidently with contacts within the agencies involved, he created his own company which was given exclusive rights over imaging and management of all photographs taken by the Mars Observer probe, the follow up to the Viking mission. His contract allowed him to release or withhold images as he personally saw fit</p>

<p>As a side note, I was reading Graham Hancock&#39;s<em>Mars Mystery</em> book a while  back and was astounding to see that he devoted several pages patting Malin on the back to a ridiculous extend (given Hancock&#39;s usual position).  On then visiting Handcock&#39;s site, I see that he tends to leave space things alone these days, not even a category for it.</p>
