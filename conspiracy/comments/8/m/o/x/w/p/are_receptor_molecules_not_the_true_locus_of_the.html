        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just read this article and it seems that 5-MEO-DALT binds to the SERT at Ki 6.30.</p>

<p>Do psychedelics need to bind to SERT to work? Is that why cocaine and SSRIs make psychedelics ineffective?</p>

<p>More importantly, is binding to the SERT as consequential as binding to the serotonin receptor with respect to its downstream effects?</p>

<p>Are monoamines all like this?</p>

<p>Is this why I can so easily distinguish my ADD medications (amphetamine and dexmethylphenidate) apart from each other, because they have different effects on the transporters?</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding like a conspiracy theorist loser, I want to be my own insanity&#39;s [devil&#39;s] advocate and ask &quot;is the transporter the locus at which subjectivity is generated and effects are exerted by drugs?&quot;</p>

<p>Is filling the transporters in your brain what causes you to have distinguishable moods? Futilely, I&#39;m going to ask &quot;if perception is only entangled with spatial and temporal dimensions and is more than just a material over a period of time, why don&#39;t we recognize this sentience as the more obviously relative dimension in the universe?&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to drop this bombshell right here, and this is directly from me without me copying anybody: Sit next to a bag full of a lot of drugs for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a bunch of drugs in your system for an hour, and time will have budged from its place on top of your perspective like oil on water and will now be obscured from your perspective. That&#39;s transporter-mediated relativity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good questions </p>

<p>The transporters and neurotransmitters are what is usually effected by drugs and we make new drugs by modifying things that bind to what we want. However I would argue that the feelings or effects are not directly felt from the receptors but from your overall state of mind, which is imagined by the brain. That is to say like a hologram, every part adds to the whole but no one part is responsible. But a brain is much more complicated than this simple analogy and is more like any structures, each a hologram of emergent properties that in turn add together to make your mind. So your language processing and speech centers are distinct from visual center but you could lose all three and still be yourself, more or less.</p>

<p>Also physics strongly suggests that there is something special about the observer that is outside of time. You can look up the delayed choice quantum eraser that proves decisions can go back in time. Its spooky </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That thing in physics that you&#39;re talking about is about how if you want to look at an atom, you will need to shoot some light at it, and light is particles called photons, and they are not completely weightless so they physically perturb the atom when they hit it. It&#39;s not about whether it&#39;s possible to accurately make a logically-grounded conception of one&#39;s own metaphysical perspective.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really tired but I hope this makes sense. </p>

<p>My question is only about nomenclature/what we call things. I find it illogical that my head is a bunch of materials in a certain place during a certain time and if it gets damaged really super badly my metaphysical functioning will stop. Why does my brain being bashed in or not have an influence on my thoughts, which scientifically are in the realm of &quot;things which may be epistemologically part of a Matrix--type simulation&quot;? Why do brain waves, which are made up of mass-bearing electrons have a creepy connection to my state of arousal if my metaphysical existence is nothing but a myth?</p>

<p>I then said perhaps the most important thing having to do with entanglement in the world today doesn&#39;t have to do with individual atoms or photons, but rather with the spooky action at a distance occurring simultaneously in our brain and in our perception/consciousness (which, again, I thought was supposed to be a myth).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your brain merely is advanced enough to access the consciousness/personality software universal to people across all of existence. No one is an island, all our thoughts come from the same place. Embrace the pilot wave 3521 of Bohmiann mechanics (3521 because 3+2=5, 5+1=6. Wild animals can count to four and not above, this sequence of numbers takes the first three numbers and demonstrates the fifth and sixth term.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then how come if I get a tbi, I can lose control of my bladder/the rest of that software permanently, and I think wild animals don&#39;t think highly enough of us to entertain the fifth of something in one of our shallow little psychologically perverse games because they subconsciously (on all levels of brain activity and everything) understand us as being uncool, pathetic, etc, so like I&#39;m the same way as they are, for example: if Ted Kazinski were to send me his resume and tell me to make edits, I wouldn&#39;t entertain that notion deeply enough to wonder whether it&#39;s double spaced or not, I would just continue about my life as if it never happened</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IDK man wild animals don&#39;t treat me so bad, the doves and the crows talk with me at least. Also, it probably has to do with synchronization; as you said, the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. It makes sense that when you lose some parts then your software starts to glitch out; think about deleting parts of your operating system kernel: even if you maintain moderate functionality, processes that normally worked simply are no longer there. If other processes are dependent on those routines that&#39;s when problems really start to arise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well sure, I saw you mentioned you have a patent pending, me too I used the dicarboxylic acid from hemp usually attached to cannabinoids to make carboxyl-functionalized graphite and it&#39;s way cheaper than using a miniature fusion reactor or whatever to make the stuff it comes out clean too; my point is we can use that to make water filters and windmills and stuff, I&#39;m going to get access to a vacuum furnace in june/july so I can make steel with it and test it; I feel like making skyscraper greenhouses is probably one of the first steps towards a synthetic biological civilization. I&#39;m up for making submersible cities too though, really anything. I think there are far worse things in the world than designing technology to improve people&#39;s lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve checked the other chemicals companies. There&#39;s no other biological reactor (as you yourself agree is the key) as productive as cannabis sativa in terms of pure dicarboxylic acid. Here&#39;s the public recipe for decarboxylating hemp/any cannabis using an oil bath <a href="http://www.patentsencyclopedia.com/app/20120046352">http://www.patentsencyclopedia.com/app/20120046352</a>. It&#39;s literally worrying about the free acid. This stuff is literally the basis for amino acids <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicarboxylic_acid">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicarboxylic_acid</a> and pure dicarboxylic acid HAS NOT BEEN ISOLATED PREVIOUSLY PUBLICLY. That&#39;s why I patented the process for using it in the method of creating sheets of carboxyl-graphene that self assemble into layers of graphite. It&#39;s amazing how in the sun a flake will balance energetically in the middle of another flake perfectly, floating on the surface of water. This stuff has potential to make high speed bioprinters. We&#39;ll be able to print out vats full of  amniotic fluid and regenerate people&#39;s organs and stuff with an optronic bioprinting array. Shit will be so futuristic and we can even use the light reflected off other bits of existence to reconstruct anyone so no one has to die forever either and we can get faster and faster until we&#39;re beings of even more energy to do stuff and things with friends.</p>

We&#39;re all interconnected and as long as you are honest with yourself and work to realize your dreams it doesn&#39;t matter what the circumstances of present reality are honestly, your mind is a lot more powerful than you think.

    <div class="md"><p>Well people are already working with optronics and such and making the next generation of computers as we speak, I&#39;m just lowering the cost of the base material used for it. I just haven&#39;t had access to the tools required to prove it&#39;s use for composites inside a laboratory. I&#39;ve gotten the spectroscopy tests at GWU done (I am a former NoVa-ite residing in Shreveport, LA now) and I could definitely improve my refining processes but a doctoral candidate working on graphene as well was the one who operated the microscope, looked at it, congratulated me on my work and said it looked good, so I definitely have hope for the future. Vacuum Furnace in about a month is the next step.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, I get the fear of not wanting others to have access to it but this shit literally enables limitless energy so I have a larger fear of the United States just throwing a big ol&#39; Secrecy Act sticker on it and shutting down any further plans I have with it. Hiding isn&#39;t an option, I just have to make as large of a splash possible when I get exposure with it via crowdfunding/whatever so it won&#39;t matter if the gubmint tries anything, too many people will know the secret of weed. </p>

<p>Basically my largest hurdle has been finding a product I can penetrate the market with successfully as the basic material does not cut it so hopefully steel will work. I&#39;m also building a 3D printer <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Chimera-60-DLP-resin-3d-printer/">http://www.instructables.com/id/Chimera-60-DLP-resin-3d-printer/</a> soon<sup>tm</sup> (I fucked around and didn&#39;t order the robotics parts necessary until two days ago) so I can mix it into the resin I make (I use tapioca starch and vinegar, basic bioplastic and viscosity required is easy to achieve) and print things out with that. Turning dreams into reality is quite difficult but I&#39;m not doing anything else so I&#39;ll keep at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Receptor binding is only the incident effect of psychoactives. Those receptors act as physical actuators which deform upon binding, dependant on the structure of both molecule and receptor, causing secondary reactions on the other side of the cell membrane, which in turn initiate signal cascades ultimately instructing the nucleus to express certain proteins, which go on to modulate activity in other systems throughout the cell, organ, and body. We barely understand this complex system of so many variables.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I didn&#39;t actually read it all lol. Yeah so certain aspects of mood are modulated by receptor expression and accordingly, receptor activation. Endogenous neurotransmitters are synthesised as needed and the brain stays balanced by internalising receptors which are excessively activated. Dopamine specifically seems to modulate reward seeking and behaviour reinforcement, by strengthening neural pathways which result in desired outcomes. Using extogenous and synthetic drugs to manipulate mood and behaviour is clever, but ultimately we don&#39;t know exactly how it all works</p>
