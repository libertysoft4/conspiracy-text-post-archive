Many very low iq individuals will point to Hurricane Sandy as an example of how large herds of people live in harmony without modern electronics &amp; electricity.  The ghetto’s that have the guns will take over.  Those that dont have them are fucked.  You wont be able to get to your cash in the bank.  Even if you have paper cash nobody will want paper.  Humans are tribal. Anarchy is a pipe dream white people addicted to modern comforts created &amp; its bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same as socialist-dictators. socio-fascism or communist-dictatorship.
The socio-/commune part refers to people&#39;s freedom to have a will.
The fasci-/dictator part invalidates the first part (will of the state)</p>

<p>Anarchy (left): an-arch = without order -&gt; individual order. (will of people placed within themselves) (internal rule)</p>

<p>Dictatorship - (right/exter) - institutionalized autorithy - archaic = direct order -&gt; social stratification. (will of people placed outside of themselves) (external rule)</p>

<p><em>&quot;A commune (the French word appearing in the 12th century from Medieval Latin communia, meaning a large gathering of people sharing a common life; from Latin communis, things held in common)is an intentional community of people living together, sharing common interests, often having common values and beliefs, as well as shared property, possessions, resources, and, in some communes, work, income or assets.</em></p>

<p><em>In addition to the communal economy, consensus decision-making, non-hierarchical structures and ecological living have become important core principles for many communes. There are many contemporary intentional communities all over the world, a list of which can be found at the Fellowship for Intentional Community (FIC).For the usually larger-scale, political entities in communist political theory, see socialist communes, which are similar but distinct social organizations.&quot;</em></p>

<p>This works best in small communities where people know each other, but in cities full of strangers, with different beliefs, or even if the beliefs match, there will be violence, because beliefs are open to interpretation. </p>

<p>Having common life interests, hobbies or voluntarily sharing a life is what makes all that possible. Not generalised beliefs like believing that 1*0 = 0; because someone can come and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=0!+factorial+">say that 0! = 0 x 1 = 1</a>, thus negating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obCjODeoLVw">your importance and being able to take away from you.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>false.  technically &quot;archy&quot; is just hierarchy - just a leadership system.  there are lots of examples of leaderless systems that find consensus.  we use them everyday.  language itself is a classic example.  so the technical problem of organizing or &quot;finding consensus&quot; has already been tackled in anarchic systems.  note that anarchy doesn&#39;t mean no rules, but no rulers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey man no worries.  it&#39;s not the only example.  people have mutually agreed upon using roads such that people moving in opposite directions are on opposite sides.  nobody really complains about crazies crossing lanes even though it&#39;s possible.  why?  because everyone&#39;s selected not to.  a game theory consensus play that required no coercion.  happens all the time.  we just make a bigger deal about it than we should.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that you&#39;ve never heard of Catalonia or Chiapas or Rojava is lamentable. Those with curious minds will find they have implemented anarchist self-rule in the worst of situations. The governments that refused to provide education or healthcare can send all the gunmen and missiles their way, and the anarchists repel them and win even more hearts and minds amongst the people. Even if you&#39;re a minority, white, cisgendered faggot, they will welcome you into their societies and offer you land and work. But if you bring threats or bribes, they will slam the door in your face. Statism is a social experiment and it has run it&#39;s course. People want to excercise their free will. Anarchy is another social experiment and it has been succesfully implemented under some of the harshest conditions on earth. </p>
