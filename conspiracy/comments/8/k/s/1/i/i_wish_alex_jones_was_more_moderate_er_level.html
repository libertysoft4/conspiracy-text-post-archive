    <div class="md"><p>Jones is controlled opposition.  I suspect some people who stitch together weird media attack pieces on Jones to also be controlled opposition, e.g. Fintan Dunne: <a href="http://breakfornews.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4945">http://breakfornews.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4945</a> .  Besides the weird attack, note that the admin tries to convince people with a tinyurl hoax that Alex is CIA.</p>

<p>My point is don&#39;t trust any of them.  Research, but research alone.  Never attach yourself to a group, and go by simple wisdom.</p>

<p>Just consider this little source I found: <a href="http://www.aimovement.org/csi/index.html">http://www.aimovement.org/csi/index.html</a></p>

<p>According to these hundreds of declassified pages (obtained through the Freedom of Information Act), we see that controversial figures in the Native American community Russell Means and Ward Churchill are FBI informants and in bed with other intelligence sources.  Why does this matter?</p>

<p>Ward Churchill helped the government kill Natives in the 1970&#39;s at Wounded Knee <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_incident">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_incident</a> .  Afterwards Churchill and Means (who eventually got rich) stood by as the government came through and enacted forced eugenics programs on Native women.</p>

<p>So of course after 9/11 we saw Churchill stand up as the controlled opposition.  He was the old model, the 60&#39;s radical.  But his purpose was clear: To galvanize the public in fury against his &#39;little eichmann&#39; comments. To drive support for the war and attention away from any investigation into 9/11.  As disgusting as it was, it was brilliantly clever.</p>

<p>Russell Means is still being used.  In the mid 80&#39;s he was used to run against Ron Paul for the libertarian presidential nomination. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Means#Other_political_involvement">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Means#Other_political_involvement</a> Why? Maybe to ensure Ron Paul as the nominee.</p>

<p>Recently Russell has been a monthly guest on the Alex Jones show.  Yet Alex&#39;s fans never raise an eyebrow to Mean&#39;s clear informant/agent past. Why is he chummy with Alex, who is now friends with Ron Paul?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the second time I have seen you type &quot;Bravarian&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s <strong>Bavarian</strong>. As in the region of Europe known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria">Bavaria</a>.</p>

<p>And the Bavarian Death Cults you regard as euphemisms are indeed an accurate description of secret societies such as the Order of the Death&#39;s Head (the cult of the Nazi Waffen SS) and their supposed American offshoot, the Order of the Skull and Bones.</p>

<p>If I see you type Bravarian one more time, I shall mock you mercilessly and heap great scorn upon you! Good day sir!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just thought you might want to correct that particular habit of misspelling an historic geographical region as it gives the impression that you are ignorant and poorly educated about the world you live in.</p>

<p>Since you have now clarified with your above statement that you were previously ignorant of existence of Bavaria, I assume you will now concede that the existence of Bavarian Death Cults is a topic of which you are wholly unqualified to discuss.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should read more and opine less?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you are being downvoted because the posters in this thread are generally fans of Alex Jones, and they feel you are coming across as a troll / unobjective interloper.  I listen to the show, and generally agree with a lot of the criticisms leveled against him.  Additionally, I would add that he often falls into the &quot;Since time began&quot; conspiracy narrative, which I think is of dubious veracity.  That being said, a lot of the things he brings up I consider to be legitimate avenues of inquiry.  Take 9/11.  You know as well as I do that neither of us are probably ever going to really know what happened on that day.  So we basically have two options:  believe the official story, or disbelieve the official story, and if we fall into the latter category, we can argue about how much we don&#39;t believe.  I do not believe the official story, and I think that there is clearly a lot of evidence to point to some kind of criminal activity that points to the government as accomplice.</p>

<p>Examining the conspiracy narrative over the longer term yields similar results, although the evidence is generally more abundant, yet not reported on by the MSM.  To put it more succinctly:  The battle humanity is party to, has been the same since we started cultivating land and building cities; it is the battle between state power (coercion) and individual sovereignty (freedom).  Whether or not Alex Jones is right about everything is not really the point - the fact that he is fighting on the side of freedom and liberty is enough for me to conclude that his heart is at least in the right place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite a bit, actually.  First off, it remains unclear what exactly happened aboard flight 83, which crashed in western, PA.  I suppose that is a tangential element.</p>

<p>I guess I am having trouble understanding how either of the world trade centers basically exploded mere hours after being struck by an airplane.  There are the numerous reports by first responders detailing explosions in both buildings.  </p>

<p>So, how two very tall, very overbuilt buildings collapsed through the path of greatest resistance (themselves) and turned to dusty piles of molten-hot metal and debris (the heat signature being given off weeks after the event indicates temperatures far hotter than what would be considered possible given simple kerosene as the only combustible agent) I consider to be suspicious, and not adequately addressed by the 9/11 comission.</p>

<p>How building 7 collapsed is another mystery.  At first,the explanation was &quot;thermal expansion&quot; - an explanation so ludicrous it was hardly even reported on by the MSM.  they later retracted that explanation and have yet to issue another one.</p>

<p>Lastly, a Danish scientist recently reported finding active thermitic material in WTC dust.  The dust&#39;s authenticity is traceable.  No one has yet come forward with an explanation as to how it got there.</p>

<p>Honestly, bud,if at this point there isn&#39;t something about the 9/11 commission you don&#39;t believe, you are either a liar, or a fool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about flight 83 remains unclear? </p>

<p>The WTC towers didn&#39;t fall into the path of least resistance. They fell into air. The melting point of aluminum is low enough to have been melted by the fires that were preseent. WTC 7&#39;s collapse is a result of massive damage from the collapse of the Twin Towers and the ensuing inferno, and <a href="http://www.structuremag.org/Archives/2007-11/SF-WTC7-Gilsanz-Nov07.pdf">actual scientists</a> have come up with scientific explanations for why this happened. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not too sure if I believe this Danish scientist. It looks like he worked with Stephen Jones, who is known to have overlooked the presence of sulfur from drywall when making his false conclusion that there was thermite at the WTC. </p>

<p>Honestly, bud, to call me a liar or a fool right after posting all of that conspiracy theorist nonsense is laughable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you believe the official story that Mohammed Atta had a <a href="http://100777.com/node/244">flameproof passport</a> that miraculously survived the jet fuel fireball that was hot enough to cut through steel frames yet was <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/14873/">miraculously recovered</a> amidst the tonnes of rubble and dust within days of the twin towers collapsing?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good thing his luggage also managed to get misplaced and didn&#39;t make it onto the doomed flight. Otherwise we might have missed his <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/sep/30/terrorism.september113">final detailed instructions</a> to his fellow hijackers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we must have different definitions of <em>refuted</em>. The link you have provided merely argues that the passport could have miraculously survived the flames and rubble. In fact, after reading this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The passport was recovered by NYPD Detective Yuk H. Chin from a male passerby in a business suit, about 30 years old. The passerby left before being identified, while debris was falling from WTC 2. The tower collapsed shortly afterwards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... I am even <strong>more</strong> suspicious. Who was that mysterious business man who so miraculously got his hands on a damning piece of paper evidence to prove who was on that flight? Why did he disappear without a trace? Doesn&#39;t pass the sniff test, bud.</p>
