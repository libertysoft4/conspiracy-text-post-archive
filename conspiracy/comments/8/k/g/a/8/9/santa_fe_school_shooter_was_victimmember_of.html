<li>allow prayer in schools. The liberal brainwashing is ruining another generation of open thinkers and prayer is the only thing that can end moral degenracy. 2. this country was founded by Christian men and immigrants and liberal politics are trying to exterminate America&#39;s organic culture. White Christian men will become a minority within 10 years and our good for nothing politicians are doing nothing but stuffing their pocketbooks. 3. &quot;that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,&quot; Creator, it&#39;s right there in the Declaration of Indepedence!

    <div class="md"><p>This country was also founded by immigrants a fact that you ignore in claiming that immigrants are one of the reasons this country is going downhill. Also I might add that Jesus was brown as he was born in the middle east so this whole white men loosing majority status as a fear tactic designed to justify your misogynistic racism is a transparent attempt at best. Furthermore, praying so far that i have seen has an impressively bad success rate to prevent sexual abuse, poverty, feeding the starving, preventing tyranny, etc... Im all for prayer but at the same time pull up your sleeves and get to work changing the world to the benefit of all mankind rather then holding on to a white patriarchal status quo that at this point in history should be an obsolete methodology as it gave several millennia of tyrannical rulers oppressing their people! </p>
