<p>Student: We assembled outside for a fire drill, then we heard gunshots</p>

<p>A Santa Fe High School student described the moment they all heard gunshots.</p>

<p>&quot;So, it was just a normal-like class day. We all were doing our work in first period. And then all of a sudden like it&#39;s a fire drill,&quot; 14-year-old junior Angelica Martinez said.</p>

<p>&quot;So we followed the fire drill procedures. And then we went outside. Like we were all standing there, but not even five minutes later, we all start hearing gunshots.&quot;
That&#39;s when everybody starts running, she said, despite teachers telling them to &quot;stay put.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But we&#39;re all just running away.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can’t confirm the timeline but a student told KTRK-TV that his friends saw a shooter with a shotgun so they pulled the fire alarm to warn other students.  That’s a very possible explanation for the fire drill report.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think it&#39;s too soon to go off quotes about the timeline in the aftermath of a chaotic situation. My guess would be that if the fire alarm went off before the shooting, the shooter or someone else pulled it, like you said. A teacher would assume there was a fire drill or it was pulled by mistake, but by law, you have to leave the building. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw that once a teacher started to hear shooting, he pulled the alarm to get the other kids out of harms way. Doesn’t make sense to do that but, it could have saved lives. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to William Cooper’s 1991 book titled “Behold A Pale Horse,” the “secret government” have long planned to abolish the Second Amendment via a series of false flag events designed to drum up support for a total gun ban.</p>

<p>The government encouraged the manufacture and importation of military firearms for the criminals to use. This is intended to foster a feeling of insecurity, which would lead the American people to voluntarily disarm themselves by passing laws against firearms. Using drugs and hypnosis on mental patients in a process called Orion, the CIA inculcated the desire in these people to open fire on schoolyards and thus inflame the antigun lobby. This plan is well under way, and so far is working perfectly. The middle class is begging the government to do away with the 2nd amendment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if we are suggesting that there is some evidence that this was done to cover up the IG, the timing makes no sense. These things capture headlines for a couple of day, maybe a week, and then the public&#39;s attention has moved on.</p>

<p>Considering the IG report hasn&#39;t even been released to anyone yet, is still in a draft form, needs to be reviewed by multiple agencies, needs to go through some back and forth, and then finalized, chances are we aren&#39;t seeing this for <em>at least</em> a couple of weeks, it may even be closer to a month.</p>

<p>If we are close to a month out from the actual public release, and considering how often school shootings are happening in this country, if something this far away from the release confirms the &quot;prediction&quot; then it is a safe prediction because you can bank on the fact it is going to happen, even if none of them were any conspiracy.</p>

<p>If it happened within a couple of days of the public release, one way or another, that would be something. But this? No way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The leaks from it are already in the news, </p>

<p>&quot;As we reported earlier Thursday, a long-awaited report by the Department of Justice&#39;s internal watchdog into the Hillary Clinton email investigation has moved into its final phase, as the DOJ notified multiple subjects mentioned in the document that they can privately review it by week&#39;s end, and will have a &quot;few days&quot; to craft any response to criticism contained within the report, according to the Wall Street Journal.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s out there for political junkies and of course those in Washington.</p>

<p>This shooting will dominate headlines for another week at least. Anything released or leaked about the IG report heading into this weekend and next is now buried by the shooting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What substantial leaks have there been?</p>

<p>And, honestly, after the spin and trumping up of the &quot;leaks&quot; leading up to the Nunes memo, I think it would be ridiculous for anyone to believe anything anyone tells them about what is in the memo, before seeing the whole thing, because people are going to try and make it appear like what little information we know will confirm their prejudicial beliefs about the investigation.</p>

<p>Even if this dominates for a week, the real release, which is going to get the most headlines, is not going to come out before then. So I still think the timing doesn&#39;t support the hypothesis or the prediction.</p>

<p>That would be the news going into the weekend but no longer. It gives these people another week of cover in the press and this shooting will, of course, be campaigned on. The complicit media will cover this excessively and make it into a political story against the GOP. </p>

<p>It is impeccable timing for them and was accurately predicted by some in the conspiracy community. You dont find it a little weird that people are predicting tragedies?</p>

<p>Citation of the actual leak that says this? Are you sure you aren&#39;t just spouting someone&#39;s opinion of what might be in documents? This is exactly what I warned about with the Nunes comparison.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, not at all. As I already pointed out, these have become commonplace in America, and we are probably a month away from the release. Something that happens seemingly monthly (such as a mass shooting) happening within  a month of something isn&#39;t hard to predict.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They took them to UTMB (in Galveston) because it’s the closest Level1 trauma center. You don’t take severe gunshot wounds to the shitty county hospital unless it’s literally the only option. UTMB is a great hospital.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, no problem. In our area, we say, &quot;they&#39;re at UTMB...or Mainland...&quot;</p>

<p>UTMB is a Level 1 trauma center, Clear Lake is a Level 2 and Mainland is a level 4.</p>

<p>Basically,for something like a gunshot, it&#39;s no surprise to me some victims with more serious injuries were taken to UTMB. If my kid was shot, I would be very concerned if they ended up at Mainland. I get what you&#39;re saying; better a hospital than no hospital. Personally, I have had some bad experiences with Mainland, so maybe my own issues with them came across too crass.</p>

<p>Level I (Comprehensive) 
Level II (Major) 
Level III (Advanced)
Level IV (Basic) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you think the problem is a little deeper than guns? I mean, you are dismissing this kid as mentally ill and blaming the guns. This seems to happen after every shooting in America. Don&#39;t you think its strange that there is suddenly an overwhelming amount of kids who are shooting up their schools? Kids have always had access to guns, have always gone to school... </p>

<p>Is it an issue with the schools? Are the teachers missing obvious red flags? How do these kids go to school everyday planning to shoot it up and nobody notices? Are they being isolated? Are these kids really just desperate for attention?</p>

<p>Is it an issue with society? Is it an issue with the parents? Why do these kids feel life is so cheap? </p>

<p>Is it the medication they are being prescribed? I know a huge majority of the shootings come from kids on medication, why isn&#39;t this being seriously looked into?</p>

<p>I mean wouldn&#39;t it be a lot better if we were able to stop kids from shooting up their schools because none of them wanted too... </p>
