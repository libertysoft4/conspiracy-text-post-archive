    <div class="md"><p>The censorship has gotten worse. it is difficult to find a search engine that doesn&#39;t engage in censorship and shadow banning. The top three search engines are mainly Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo. There used to be others trying to create their own search engines and directories like DMOZ but they have gone down under now. Many Web Directories have kinda started to sink under and it is difficult to find a quality directory that doesn&#39;t have spam, maybe i am wrong on that but who knows. It has become like a monopoly or duopoly or trippoly. A very tiny number of private corporations can dictate what we see in search results thus can be the ones that decide who gets to be elected to President and Congress because they can censor what they don&#39;t like and essentially can game an election process.</p>

<p>So that means only special political candidates that Google approves of will ever be a Government official. Nobody who wants to be independent will ever win. The private corporations can dictate and manipulate who becomes President, a Congressperson, a Senator, a Federal Judge. They can now dictate our Government and policies by the manipulation of their algorithms. Now that is the &quot;Russian Collusion&quot; that they are accusing Trump of. It is a handful of private corporations, FBI Agent Mueller, and other corrupt SWAMP creatures that are sabotaging and manipulating the United States elections. It isn&#39;t really Russia and neither is it Trump but a handful of corporations decide and manipulate as to who may become the next newly elected politician.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weirdly enough that subreddit wasn&#39;t the first for me, but it is now.  Point still stands though.  If you word something weirdly don&#39;t be surprised when you get weird results.  Like &quot;reddit conspiracy&quot; where it is going to make the search engine look for a conspiracy about reddit versus &quot;conspiracy subreddit&quot; where it is going to look for subreddits with conspiracy in the name.  I get different results when I switch the words in my search as well.</p>

<p>Also is the finlandconspiracy a joke or something like flatearth? And more importantly, why is it the top result? Is that a subtle disinformation technique to continue to foster the widespread notion that all conspiracies are ridiculous? </p>

<p>What a world we live in... now you have to explicitly ask to hear another side of a story.

<p>Probably. I wouldn&#39;t doubt that at all.</p>

<p>2010: <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/09/13/facebook_voting_study_online_friends_influence_voter_turnout_in_elections_.html">Facebook experimented on people, trying to get them to vote</a></p>

<p>Those are human experiments (isn&#39;t that illegal?) done by Facebook, but I&#39;m sure Google is doing the same and they&#39;re just better at keeping quiet about it.</p>

<p>I just did a quick search &quot;google experiments on users&quot; and 8 of the top 10 results are about the Facebook experiments...</p>
