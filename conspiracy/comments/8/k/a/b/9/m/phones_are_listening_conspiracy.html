<p>i usually leave my phone in my room upstairs while i watch tv in the living room downstairs. today however, i brought it with me as i watched &quot;the kissing booth,&quot; starring joey king and jacob elordi. </p>

<p>after the movie, i went on my phone &amp; went onto youtube. &amp; there were about 3 videos all with joey, jacob, &amp; THE KISSING BOOTH MOVIE ITSELF. i have never searched them up or anything even close to them, yet they still appeared in my feed. </p>

<p>not only this, but during the movie, i was talking about how cute joey would look with bangs. CAN YOU GUESS WHAT HER HAIR WAS LIKE IN THE YOUTUBE VIDEOS??</p>

<p>i am beyond freaked.</p>

<p>for the second time.</p>

<p>Lambs to the slaughter.</p>

<p>Information is power.  we are already divulging far too much in one place on a subverted platform called reddit, but do what you can to obfuscate, confuse, and poison the well.</p>

<p>In 2011 large capacity hard drives were in short supply.  The NSA bought up so many to record an avalanche of data it actually affected market prices.  It’s that bad.  Yes they are watching.  Yes they are listening, and YES they are recording.</p>

<p>I commend you for understanding the ugly reality you reside in, even if only the surface of it. </p>

<p>How so?<br/>
It&#39;s <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9555403/capturing-mobile-phone-traffic-on-wireshark">pretty straightforward</a> to intercept incoming/outgoing packets.<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-rating">Zero-rating</a> doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t able to see traffic.<br/>
As OP pointed out, in case of real-time eavesdropping the traffic would be considerable and some wireshark nerd would most likely have found out about it by now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in terms of cost benefit for setting up this surveillance infrastructure, there should be at least two systems to justify data collection. 
One should revolve around intelligence gathering for crime prevention, measuring political opinion, tracking political dissent, personal data collection for demographic control, analysis for social experimentation etc. 
The other branch might be for making commercial messaging/company advertising, more efficient. </p>

<p>From what it looks like, you were used for the latter category, which looks like minimal consequences will be suffered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who works in IT Security...They do. Do you have a debit/credit card? Do you purchase things online? Do you carry a cell phone with you?
These things are all linked in one way or another, and they all talk to eachother.
Target, for example, can track where you&#39;re at in their stores and see how long you stood in an area (using their cartwheel app) and then they target coupons based on that data.
You&#39;re browsing Facebook and see something interesting, say a nifty gismo one of your friends is talking about...you stop and look at it for a couple seconds...that information is tracked that you had potential interest and you will start seeing targeted advertising.</p>

<p>It goes on and on. I used to be paranoid about it, and Im still consciously aware of what is being done with my digital persona, but Ive come to accept it. In the digital age we live in, the only way big brother wont directly keep tabs on you is to live in the forest with nothing but the air you breathe (But the satellites will still watch you if they care enough to)</p>
