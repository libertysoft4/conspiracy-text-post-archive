    <div class="md"><p>Toys:</p>

<p>5 companies are on a bill of lading for 1 shipping container, contents listed as 1.1KG of &quot;plastic jewelry&quot;, and 6,852KG of &quot;soccer/footballs&quot; from China. 1 company in California makes electronic and other &quot;educational toys&quot; and seems to be on the up-and-up. 1 bait-shop in Idaho with a registered sex-offender living at the same address as a company listed as receiver of goods from the shipment. 1 Some financial agency shell-game in Chicago. 1 shady day care in Salt Lake City whose owner shares the last name with an executive (see management, not mayoral) level employee working in City Hall. 1 bounce house rental company in Oregon no one has looked into yet.</p>

<p>The actual shipping of this container was facilitated by a company with an employed sales executive who once bought/sold &#39;merchandise&#39; in the defense sector</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we have a shady day-care, poorly run and probably just milking the city &amp; state for some of the sweet sweet education money or some other benefit program. Doesn&#39;t seem like too much of a &#39;conspiracy&#39;. </p>

<p>Well, seems like Kidz Kare had some parties planned in 2014 too. Josephine&#39;s and Fun Time Kidz Kare are named on a shipping manifest site. This site has detailed records of various cargo across the world. Isn&#39;t the internet awesome? So Josephine and Kidz Kare are found on this site, tied to a bill of lading(BL) for a shipping container from China. BL#OSTISZORF13B0712, container #SENU5023516, received in the port of Norfolk VA on 12/30/2013</p>

<p>This container indicates its contents as 1,100KG (quantity 271 CTN whatever ctn is meant to indicate) Fimo Plastic Jewelry and 6,825 KG (Quantity 763 CTN) 5 Inch Eva American Football 5 Eva Volleyball 5 Eva Soccerballs. </p>

<p>Look at those weights again and let it sink in. But if those inventory counts are individual units, then wtf weighs so much? Just how much can cheap plastic crap and soccerballs weigh? Apparently almost 8,000KG! For those metrically challenged that&#39;s 17,600 lbs! You know what weighs 17,000lbs? Neither do I, because that&#39;s a ridiculous amount! <a href="/u/IamChantus">/u/IamChantus</a> equates it all into [guns[(<a href="http://www.reddit.com...">www.reddit.com...</a>) for us though, so we can sleep better. Or, imagine a big pile of cheap plastic crap and soccerballs that weigh as much as a tractor trailer (without the trailer). That is a lot of #ing cheap plastic crap. And soccerballs. But seriously, what the hell kind of party are these Krazy Fun Kidz about to throw with over 17,000 lbs of cheap plastic crap and soccerballs? This party is going to be EPIC!...&quot;</p>

<p>As someone that has managed a large warehouse for years and deal with international shipping daily, those numbers are believable. The football/soccer balls are about 8 lbs a box, the plastic jewelry is about 4 lbs. 17000 lbs is no that heavy at all for a conex. They usually run 30000-50000 lbs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In previous posts I go into more specifics, it&#39;s a lot more content than people are used to finding for free, but I hit I think a lot of major r/conspiracy topics.  </p>

<p>-i am a witness to the government distributing fake psychedelic drugs at music/peace festivals
-i am a witness to backdoors in my computer
-i am a witness to being followed and attempted entrapment</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know any other source that lists the security breaches that affect every computer user as I do in privacy workshop #1.  </p>

<p>And the &#39;privacy inside your own head&#39; edition lists in one place with archived links more than 20 random acts of violence in the united states where people reported hearing voices in their heads, which really spooked me out.  </p>

<p>thanks for the kind words, hope you can keep reading when you get a chance, really trying to turn privacy workshop into a community thing because i think it&#39;s a good idea.  </p>
