        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>ok i got a really wild Theory concerning the mystery booms quite a few people are reporting, but this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so i suppose those type of theories are welcome. If they are not welcome you are free to downvote of course. Obviously i have no definite proof for this theory and they require a few big &quot;what Ifs&quot; but they are all doable and in the realm of reality and science, so that this is out of the way. </p>

<p>We have just today on <a href="/r/UFOs">/r/UFOs</a> gotten a nice PDF about the USSNimitz incident of 2004. Its a Official Summary of the events that took place. Not much new except one thing. The UFO that &quot;Styled&quot; on a whole Carrier Strike Force and made them look like chumps did infact have Optical Cloaking Capabilities, thats been confirmed from a few sources in the report. The FLIR still picked it up (infrared, not visible light) and thus we have the Gimbal video.</p>

<p>In Any case, there have been rumors on so called meta materials from said UFOs from a supposed crash in 1989 in Russia. I think after the 2004 incident army scientist put 1 + 1 together and figured that this fragments have the capability to do this. We are getting better and better at nano manufacturing and i think the US may have developed legit Optical Stealth. The Booms People been hearing could &quot;simply&quot; be Normal Sonic booms from Jets being tested. But since they are Invisible so to say thats that. Only the Boom.</p>

<p>I always assumed that the priority for the US would be to reverse engineer the Propulsion tech, i didnt even think about stealth tech until today since that detail was conveniently left out.</p>

<p>It would explain why the US is somehow so forthcoming with the release of UFO related stuff (high res Videos, interviews of pilots and Officials). Tech such as Optical stealth is Big, its a big Fat advantage and admitting it was from UFO tech would make adversaries think twice (what else did they reverse engineer!!!) about engaging the US militarily. </p>

<p>Dont forget, Im somewhat of a UFO enthusiast and to a Hammer everything looks like a Nail. Not a native english speaker aswell, hope you guys can understand it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t there also be technology to counter that tho? Chaff is just discs that create hundreds of thermal signals to track. I&#39;d imagine it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to make chaff that creates some sort of sound wave/harmonic frequency to &quot;jam&quot; these homing missiles.</p>

<p>Cyber/technological warfare revolves around constantly adapting to the fast paced changes of other countries&#39; military R&amp;D. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a huge fan of the UFO&#39;s = top secret &quot;future&quot; planes conspiracy. I fucking love seeing threads about this kinda stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sound waves are a whole different animal than the linearity of visual or electronic information.  I can stand out in my yard see a commercial jet at 37,000 and in about 34 seconds hear its sound before that jet is across the zenith.  That sound is being broadcast in a full 360 degrees.  True, the aircraft could be flying faster than the speed of sound,but that is not important. But if I had a sonic guided missile I could send it on its way to that plane based entirely on my unaided ears.</p>

<p>The sound wake of the plane would be all over the sky and the smart electronics of my weapon would easily determine where it needed to go by the physical vibrations the plane was causing in the air.</p>

<p>No matter how fast of a plane you can build, I can create a faster missile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No!  No! Not just a reply that makes you feel superior.  Give me a exact list of where I said a wrong statement about how sound generally works and where my concept, while outrageous, was impossible.  I was discussing a type of missile that would  come from behind the a/c, not directly intercept it.  --Not the best solution, of course, but given optical and electromagnetic shielding, maybe the best we could do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the fact you are doubling down is hilarious and a perfect example of the dunning kruegar effect.</p>

<p>both your missile and your target need to be slower than the speed of sound for this idiotic scheme to work. maybe it would work for a torpedo because the speed of sound in water is higher.</p>

<p>you are a moron if you think a sound guided missile would ever hit an object fast than the speed of sound, as soon as the missile reached the speed of sound it would effectively blind its self you dummy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you can admit that an aircraft, say a high-speed SR-71, leaves a trail of noise behind it, perhaps then you can understand the whole concept of your argument is flat wrong.  </p>

<p>Can you follow the passage of a jet via hearing the sound?  Yes!</p>

<p>Can instruments be created that follow those vibrations right up to and into the exhaust pipe of a jet whatever its speed?  You betcha!</p>

<p>You see, we are not really talking about sound but vibrations in the air that can be traced to the source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realise that with a privatised military industrial complex the USA is at a structural disadvantage to Russia&#39;s mostly nationalised industries.</p>

<p>Less suppliers, contractors, lobbyists, marketing, middle men and competing interests. Instead it&#39;s about the end products that planners need, not fancy expensive gadgets and expensive gizmos that nobody really needs. Lots of money and massive supply chains spread across the USA for mostly political reasons leads to inefficient end results.</p>

<p>Then you have an army who&#39;s main opponents have been nomads, farmers and ill-equiped armies after a decade of sanctions. Against a well equipped, well trained group, they&#39;re piecemeal. The main thing still is the abuse of sanctions, covert operations and the sheer size of the USA. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a falling empire as they&#39;ve managed to promote their thickest to highest positions where even tiny nations are becoming capable of outsmarting them. To the elites advantage in the USA, they&#39;ve made a docile group of fat, unintelligent, disinformed narcissistic piglets that stick to online action where they can only hear each other. Instead of tackling real power, they spend their days with make-believe money  enriching sociopath scammers, taking various drugs, addictive digital pleasure and blindly accepting the poison fed to them everyday by a billionaire corporate media. Death spiral which no amount of jingoism for a failed salesman can get them out of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well but if you follow secret aircraft &quot;enthusiast&quot; forums (like the sub forum over at ATS) then you should know, that the U.S. military-industrial complex is also working on technology for suppressing sonic booms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting theory and great post. I love these kind of posts :)</p>

<p>But even though I do concur that it&#39;s possible that the US has developed optical stealth capabilities (whether due to reverse engineering UFOs or perhaps due to their own research), I would say that it&#39;s also likely that they would have taken care of the sonic booms and developed technology to nullify them (as u/InspirationByTCamara suggested in this thread).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, it would just make sense to take care of the whole picture and leave out the sonic booms, as that can be quite a giveaway in combat. </p>

<p>What I&#39;d be interested in is people that have actually heard these booms. I&#39;m from Europe, not the US and I haven&#39;t heard any booms here, so I don&#39;t know what it sounds like and what it can thus be attributed to. If anyone that has heard these sounds can chime in and perhaps compare it to the sound of a sonic boom (which they may know how it sounds like, or they can search for videos/audios with sonic booms and compare it in their mind from memory), maybe we can get further to the source of the issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My area reported these booms and gave some bullshit physics explanation that people didn&#39;t believe.</p>

<p>Also for the past 10 years, and especially since those booming sounds we have had UFOs dropping some sort of light or multiple lights that then slowly descend to the ground apparently.</p>

<p>In my particular opinion its likely military experiments, but who really knows. There were 10-20 different accounts of this on MUFON, some accounts were multiple people sighting at different locations same time, 1 or 2 were caught on video!</p>

<p>Something really fishy! But we live close to fairchild Air Force base in eastern WA, known as a good testing area for military because of the forest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a plasma would be really, really bright. Meta materials work on a different basis. They have a negative refraction index. That means if you have a glass of water (normal refraction) and a glass of negative index meta material and put a spoon in, the spoon would look like its bend in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Negative index metamaterials are already a thing, but only up to the microwave spectrum (2-4ghz). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>iirc the Aurora air craft was said to use some sort of phased pulse propulsion and travel at hyper sonic speeds. hypersonic means it would be on the other side of the sky by the time you heard it pass, so it doesnt need to be optically hidden anyway</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always loved to read about the Aurora Project!</p>

<p>If i understand correctly, the Theory of operation of Phased Pulsed propulsion is to have a Nuclear explosion (fusion or fission) to produce thrust. While Major cool for Sublight spacecrafts its less useful in my opinion in a Military jet. Propulsion like this would produce lots of EM (in form of Xrays and other high intensity radiation) that would be easy to track via radar. Conversly something like that would be easily shot down considering that at those speeds you cant really do many fancy maneuvers to evade missile fire. (or the G-Forces rip you apart). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well it would require that you have a missile that can actually keep up, or even track it to threaten the aircraft.</p>

<p>the SR-71 operated on that principle, there was no missiles while it was in service that was able to catch it. limited stealth and a large heat sig never prevented it from being out of reach of air defenses simply due to its astronomical speed advantage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, you have a great point there. But the SR71 was fast, but not too fast. It could still do some sort of maneuvers. A Hypersonic jet may not be capable of many evasive actions and slower moving missiles could be shot at the point where the aircraft will be, instead of where it is. Also now we also have to content with the possibility of laser weapons (if fighting superpowers like russia or china), and there is no outrunning a laser. Still pretty cool piece of tech. </p>
