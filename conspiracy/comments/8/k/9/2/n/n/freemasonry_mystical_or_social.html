        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I left freemasonry many years ago, with an exemption, before completing my 3rd degree. after reading over my old emails I was intrigued by a few things said by one of the higher ups, does anyone here have any stories or insights into what Freemasonry really is? Everyone in the lodge I attended was well older than me, I wore a tie instead of bow tie once to a lodge I was visiting, I felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed. but I was given no real direction or instruction, my curiosity has been sparked ever since. I remember having to memorise around a few hundred words to repeat at my 2nd degree although I did not know why I did it, I had no idea what any of it meant. I felt like a sheep around wolves they insisted I was their brother but I felt left out, if I completed my 3rd degree would I have learned more would I have been let in on the big secret as to why they were all there? I can’t help but feel there has to be a reason why many of these men have been there for so many years of their life. And travel vast distances to hear a lecture that they all complain is sleep worthy, I feel like I’m missing the mark.
Anyway yeah insight would be great, not so much a conspiracy but felt this may the right place to discuss this topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 33 degrees you mention are from AASR / Scottish Rite, the 32nd being the last workable degree in their system, the 33rd being honorary. T</p>

<p>There are other Masonic orders with up to 99 degrees, notably the lesser known Egyptian Rite, and one that may have more than the APRMM / Egyptian Rite, the alleged New and Reformed Palladium Rite.</p>

<p>Even the AASR, while being more esoteric than traditional craft / speculative / operative Masonry, is still fairly exoteric and profaned for its initiates with vague and largely veiled symbolism, compared to other orders, the OTO and A.A. for example.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This would really be better addressed over on r/freemasonry, but that&#39;s all right.</p>

<p>The problem that most Lodges have is that&#39;s &quot;cliquish.&quot; I don&#39;t think they mean to be; it&#39;s just human nature. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve visited another Lodge, and no one would speak to me. They&#39;re trying to be rude. It can be difficult to initiate a conversation with someone you don&#39;t know. That&#39;s probably a lot of what you experienced. A lot of guys, especially older ones, use the Lodge as a social outing. They&#39;re there to spend time with their friends once or twice a month.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There aren&#39;t any real secrets outside of passwords and handshakes. What there <em>is</em> is a deeper understanding of what are basic moral lessons. People generally flit through life caring mostly about themselves and rarely about others. You can even find Masons who are like this -- those who haven&#39;t really absorbed the lessons. We can probably all agree that brotherly love is an important virtue, but it&#39;s an entirely different thing to <em>really understand it</em> an<strong>d apply *<em>it toward the whole of humanity. That&#39;s what Freemasonry is. It&#39;s being able (and willing) to step outside of the polarizing aspects of modern society and recognize that the person you disagree with is *</em>a human bei</strong>ng* -- and to treat them like* one.</p>

<p>The greatest issue Masonry has is the same issue that the various religions have. It&#39;s a problem endemic to almost all of mankind, really. We can tell you how important certain things are, but you&#39;ll never really &quot;get it&quot; if you can&#39;t make some of the discovery for yourself. The most important things in Masonry are the most simple. They&#39;re also the most over-looked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I once spent a few hours with a couple of high up Masons, and during the conversations that ensued, I repeatedly and casually affirmed I was an atheist.</p>

<p>It was very strange to me, that as I was about to leave, after our time together had concluded, one of them asked that I join their lodge. I was flattered, but I again politely protested that I&#39;m atheist. He said, &quot;it&#39;s fine, as long as you believe in a god&quot;, and taps his nose while saying it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah agreed. Hypothetically I would have needed to backtrack my position and then lie, saying publicly that I believed in a deity. Not such a big deal on my end to pretend to be a believer, as most atheists have had to endure, but for the mason to preemptively forgive my dishonesty, leaves a lasting impression about what sort of organisation it is.</p>

<p>I considered joining just to find out what they&#39;re about, but after some research I concluded that their organisation and its functions through history are highly compartmentalised. 
There appears to be a chasm between the low level masons of today who innocently just want comradeship and self improvement, and to the often self-confessed top level dialectical orchestrators of some of humanity&#39;s worst memories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You left out business contacts and connections which has a lot to do with who actually gets tapped for a membership and why they willingly accept to join. A slightly different and more mundane twist on what you might call &quot;self-improvement&quot;. </p>

<p>We also have the unusual fact that great number of world leaders, both past and present, including ones that were openly and actively hostile to one another, were all nevertheless all members of the same so-called &quot;brotherhood&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah agreed. On the whole, historically it looks to have been an organisation that serviced more to the upper classes, aristocracy, academics, politians and scholars etc. Evidently quite advantageous in regards to furthering of self-interest. </p>

<p>Just reading through r/freemasonry, it just looks like a fairly culty but benign and nerdy social group with customary terminology lathered thick, a true gentlemen&#39;s club, and I have no doubt in my mind at all that these members are fine specimens. Can&#39;t imagine anything fucking worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take on Freemasonry: It&#39;s basically a fraternity of like-minded individuals to congregate, engage their communities and primarily for the sake of networking and self-improvement, while being steeped in esoteric symbolism and occasional dramatic ritual in the form of veiled allegory containing layers of symbolism the majority are either not fully cognizant of or indifferent to for the most part. </p>

<p>And yes, some lodges can be more rigid and bureaucratic than others. I suppose it depends on the culture and mentality of the hierarchy of the lodge itself, as much as the region and jurisdiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m referring to the legitimacy of the organization in espousing authentic Rosicrucian ideals, the questionable practice of them selling monographs/degrees and advertising in comic books in the past, and their lineage in comparison to other Rosicrucian orders.</p>

<p>I&#39;m neither against nor entirely supportive of the AMORC, and agree on the surface they appear benevolent and generally beneficial to those who join. I&#39;ve known those who have benefited from joining the AMORC, and aware of a few who have not had pleasant experiences with them, which I attribute more to the individuals they dealt with directly rather than the organization itself. In short, my opinion of them is overall neutral at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you&#39;re neutral, but you question their legitimacy? That doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

<p>Additionally, my research indicates that they charge a modest membership fee for access to the monographs. That&#39;s very different than &quot;selling monographs&quot;. Every organization has to support itself, even non-profits.</p>

<p>Moreover, it seems unfair to criticize the current leadership for past instances of &quot;advertising in comic books&quot;. Besides, if you wanted to reach people in the past who were spiritual seekers, that seems like a reasonable method.</p>

<p>Regarding their &quot;linage&quot; and &quot;espousing authentic Rosicrucian ideals&quot;, AMORC&#39;s Contribution to Peace seems pretty authentic to me:</p>

<p>&quot;I contribute to Peace when I strive to express the best of myself in my contacts with others.</p>

<p>I contribute to Peace when I use my intelligence and my abilities to serve the Good.</p>

<p>I contribute to Peace when I feel compassion toward all those who suffer.</p>

<p>I contribute to Peace when I rejoice over the happiness of others and pray for their well-being.</p>

<p>I contribute to Peace when I listen with tolerance to opinions that differ from mine or even oppose them.</p>

<p>I contribute to Peace when I resort to dialogue rather than to force to settle any conflict.</p>

<p>I contribute to Peace when I respect Nature and preserve it for generations to come.</p>

<p>I contribute to Peace when I do not seek to impose my conception of God upon others.</p>

<p>I contribute to Peace when I make Peace the foundation of my ideals and philosophy.</p>

<p>I contribute to Peace when I look upon all as my brothers and sisters, regardless of race, culture, or religion.&quot;</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t care much about &quot;linage&quot; in my experience. Frankly, it seems rather pretentious and ego-based.</p>

<p>What seems to matter most to people is whether the teachings have value. My research indicates that AMORC&#39;s certainly do.</p>

<p>What is your real agenda in slandering them?</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t, at all. Only hesitantly saying their legitimately is debatable. I am far from the only person to echo such a sentiment, and as politely and nicely as I did in comparison.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, the reasons you cited seem vague and dubious at best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I explicitly stated I have issue with advertising in the back of comic books in the past, how closely their monographs resemble or differentiate from older currents as well as other contemporary variants of Rosicrucian, and the lineage of their order, meaning from which orders its founder was an initiate of or granted charter from, and what material they have incorporated into their own from others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you represent a competing organization or something? If you believe other organizations are more &quot;legitimate&quot; please explain why.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually considered joining the AMORC at one point, as well as the A.A., craft Masonry, the Scottish Rite, the Egyptian Rite, among others, but have not petitioned as I decided to wait until the time is right and after more due consideration, and honestly relieved I did not as I am not beholden to any given current or order, a decision I likely would have regretted in retrospect.</p>

<p>Impugning an organization&#39;s credibility and legitimacy, while offering no evidence is never &quot;polite&quot; or &quot;nice.&quot; On the contrary, it seems like McCarthyism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hah. Well I&#39;ll post whenever I feel compelled to, regardless. As for your argument I am just going to say I honestly do not give a fuck, and proposed you enjoy the rest of your day/night as well, but unfortunately you appear incapable to do so. If you would to argue further, I will ignore you, so enjoy arguing with yourself, assuming you are even capable of socratic reasoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re the one refusing to support your argument with real facts and evidence. So, you seem to be projecting here. </p>

<p>I am an attorney, so tearing apart weak McCarthyist smears is my idea of fun. I have enjoyed it thoroughly. </p>

<p>Looks like I hurt your feelings, though. Hope you feel better when you sober up.</p>
