    <div class="md"><p>Yeah for real it&#39;s not even more money if you account for inflation (especially shadowstats inflation [<a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/article/no-438-public-comment-on-inflation-measurement">explanation behind their numbers</a>]{<a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts">chart to 2018</a>}) people make less money nowadays than they did 40 years ago and things cost more money. Combined, we have far less spending power than ever. </p>

<p>The amount of knowledge accessible has increased but this, in turn, has increased the signal-to-noise ratio, so even if we do have access sharing the truth is incredibly difficult with most people turning you away because of cognitive dissonance/disinformation campaigns/etc.</p>

<p>Civil liberties are only respected as far as your worth to the state. The school-to-prison pipeline is an important facet of American Slavery nowadays. The 13th amendment states that enslaving convicted prisoners is legal. As long as the United States is still a slave state no American citizen will ever be free.</p>

<p>Unfiltered knowledge is double edged sword, it can help or destroy society, there&#39;s something that we aren&#39;t prepared to know, and if leaked could start a lot of conflict.</p>

<p>True Freedom is honestly a really philosophic question and should we have that ? Some say that true freedom can only came through anarchy, by liberated themselves of morality, ethics, society and compassion, all of these things can be considered chains that maintain you prisoner.</p>

<p>These things are all good points but are not so black and white as it seems</p>

The US is projected to lose half of its population due to the shift in economic and military power ever-looming on the horizon. They have been pretty much spot on in their other projections in the past and their methodology did not change.  All Western nations are being infiltrated by wave after wave of culture-destroying &quot;immigrants&quot; aka zionist/globalist walking bio weapons. We spend more on welfare than every person who contributes to the bottom line can repay combined. We really are on the edge of a plunge that will happen too quickly for most to survive, for myriad reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people who forget that it could actually be a whole lot better than this, forget that it could be better without the control system in place.  The Corporatocracy to control the pace of things.</p>

<p>Sure, things are fantastic-ish, if you chose to ignore the way things are on the other side of the scale.  OP is a guy behind a computer in his home, like me.  People like Bill Gates and their kids have a totally different view of the world and have infinite ways to jump any hurdles they encounter.  Then they grow up and create some of the conditions of the world that you and I all live by.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of fucked up, but I&#39;m not going to stop bitching about how things are, just how they are arranged for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I wanna say that I respect you, dude. You&#39;re sitting at +21 on my RES and I love the stuff you usually lay down BUT, bro the world is straight up nightmarish even if we have smartphones. The suicide rate is higher than it&#39;s ever been; we&#39;re on the precipice of yet another bankers&#39; war that no one wants to fight and will result in another wave of culture-destroying rapey &quot;immigrants&quot; being thrust upon the western world in an attempt to destroy the social fabric of every majority white nation; everyone and everything is &quot;racist&quot; and it&#39;s tearing apart what little social cohesion we had; wealth disparity is so high that the vast majority of people live fearing for what will happen next month, much less being able to plan for retirement, much less being able to plan for a legacy you&#39;d be proud to leave your children; marriages are failing at all-time record rates due to feminism (don&#39;t hate; it&#39;s just a fact. 70% of all divorces are no-fault and 70% are initiated by women); our welfare program costs more than every person who contributes can pay back resulting in year after year of deficits; Jewish crimes in the form of banking, media, and law-making have bankrupted the world at large and resulted in the spread of degeneracy which would make Weimar Germany blush; our education system has been shown to be a straight up indoctrination center at best and an absolute valueless sham at worst. I could go on, and you could probably add to this list too, but suffice to say: Shit&#39;s fucked up, dude. People are fed up, and we know who and what&#39;s causing the myriad miseries we are afflicted with but we&#39;re labeled as all sorts of epithets like &quot;racist&quot; or &quot;nazi&quot; or &quot;anti-semite&quot; for speaking out and demanding change. </p>

<p>Seriously man, I do respect you and your opinion, so, how do you come to the conclusion that we are in any way at a high point in any way other than technical achievement and creature comforts?</p>
