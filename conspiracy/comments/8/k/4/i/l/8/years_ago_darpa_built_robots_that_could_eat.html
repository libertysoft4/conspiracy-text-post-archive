        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I saw a buried post about a cool/scary DARPA project.  The idea was to enable robots to consume biological matter and convert it into energy for powering the robot. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The EATR was programmed to consume certain types of vegetation as biomass to convert into fuel, and only those types of vegetation. EATR could also use other fuels such as gasoline, kerosene, cooking oil, or solar energy.</p>

<p>The company also included &quot;chicken fat&quot; as one of its proposed fuel sources in the project overview.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energetically_Autonomous_Tactical_Robot">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energetically_Autonomous_Tactical_Robot</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of April 2009, RTI estimated that 150 pounds of biofuel vegetation could provide sufficient energy to drive the to vehicle 100 miles. The second phase of the project will have the engine determine which materials are suitable (edible) for conversion into fuel, locate those materials, and then ingest them. Basically, the machine is going to learn to eat on its own.</p>

<p>What a neat idea!  Enable a robot to eat and you don&#39;t have to worry about powering it.<br/>
<strong>I&#39;m going to share with you an excerpt from a book by Dolores Cannon which demonstrates wonderfully why DARPA  needs to knock this shit off</strong>.  </p>

<p>Have had trouble posting,  will add the book text in an edit,  I hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except humans have to consume to stay alive, and basic thermodynamics states you only get a fraction of the original consumed fuel sources energy from a being that is further up the fuel chain. For instance it takes 2000kcals of grain to produce 200kcals of beef. In that story the humans were consuming enough to maintain small hidden communities for long enough that people grew to adulthood, and the machines only took some of the people. The people had to be consuming hundreds of times more energy than the machines were getting from them.</p>

<p>There was a trade worked out with neighbors from a nearby planet that wanted minerals.   They came and took minerals mined by the subterranean community, and provided them with food in exchange.   The planet being lifeless up top didn&#39;t much affect the way they did things underground, because their system was being supplied with energy from an exterior source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I am basing my belief on the knowledge that you provided. There are so many logical fallacies in ths story the person came up with which they obviously didnt think out. For instance, you said that they had to be burned for fuel at a central base but then said the robots were charging up right as they sucked them out of the hole? Alsp if space travel exists and they are able to mine and a trade with another planet why cant they get help or leave to this other planet?</p>

<p>I said what I said because you seemed so hung up on semantics in the story instead of the message of it.  If the wording used to describe the method of extracting energy from humans as related in the story doesn&#39;t please you,  it&#39;s not my concern.

<p>I&#39;m interested in knowing why you find this scenario impossible?</p>

<p>From my perspective,  you appear to be rather uninformed concerning recent technological advances and completely oblivious to what they could foster in just a few generations&#39; time. </p>

<p>Ever heard of a predicted future event termed the Singularity? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forget about Hollywood then, print media works fine. You&#39;d have never heard of Kurzweil if his message is that &quot;AI and humanity will co-exist peacefully, both developing in different directions&quot;. You&#39;d have never read any Asimov if his stories had involved robots following the rules without any problems. Both would be nobodies and completely obscure.</p>

<p>Why? Conflict is an essential part of any entertaining story. Without entertainment, you don&#39;t have popularity. Without popularity, ideas don&#39;t spread. Couple that with the powers that be using choice messaging to help reinforce our slavery and oppression and you have a population of brainwashed individuals, such as yourself.</p>

<p>You can test for this bias easily. Going off memory alone, how many individuals can you name that have spoken out about problematic futures involving AI? How many can you name that have said AI, more than likely, will not be a problem?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that the second opinion is wrong, it&#39;s just that you&#39;ve never heard it discussed before. By design.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty much the opposite of what I&#39;m saying. People are fucked, there&#39;s plenty of evidence for that and a great deal of historical precedent. The powers that be will forever be trying to keep us face down in the dirt, through manufactured wars and outrage. </p>

<p>On the other hand, what evidence do we have that artificial intelligence and autonomous robots will be a bad thing? None whatsoever. Just a bunch of invented opinions that have been shoved down our throats both organically and artificially.</p>

<p>The idea of the singularity is entirely speculative, based on zero factual information. There are no AI in labs. They haven&#39;t been tested in simulations. There is no real evidence that any of it is possible. It&#39;s all conjecture and opinion with no basis in reality. No one knows what will actually happen.</p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that the development of an unbiased third party, not under the control of the powers that be, is one of the best ways forward. It&#39;s something that certain actors are desperately trying to suppress, or gain control of should it be developed, as it will represent a fundamental loss of their power.</p>

<p>AI is a serious threat and those that seek control and power are those that ultimately benefit and would be the ones to push for it and continue its development.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a scary fucking slippery slope and it&#39;s a steep one because it can enable control pretty quickly.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never once seen it,  but I can assure you they are not &quot;exposing&quot; any agendas. No agendas are exposed on television in an unplanned manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unfortunate that pop science has convinced people that brains are ultinately just complex Turing machines. They speculate on the source of conscious experience in all sorts of ways but the most popular seems to consider gaining consciousness as an unknown emergent feature of evolution that happened in the past (which if true implicates that things like the internet and even the sun may be conscious beings).The problem with taking this idea and saying we&#39;re just robots is the critical fact that no one on this planet has a technique or process which will produce an AI which is &quot;awake&quot; in the same way we are (or even a reliable way to prove something is conscious).</p>

<p>My only point here is that the science of consciousness is distinct from neuroscience in the sense that modern neuroscience has established quite a bit of knowledge regarding which parts of the brain synthesize specific parts our experience but are missing any hard evidence on <em>how</em> exactly this synthesis works. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know how those electric impulses and ion gates becomes what we see hear and think, let alone how we experience time and higher emotions so until we can determine a method by which one may construct a conscious being I&#39;m gonna say humans are not meat robots, our bodies definitely are but as of now we can&#39;t say the same about our conscious experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dolores Cannon is hands down my favorite author and she has contributed much to the field. She pioneered her own personal techniques into past life regression and was able to get clients into a deeper state of trance and pull through more information than others.</p>

<p>She remained neutral and always asked furthering questions to help bring forth more information.</p>

<p>I just recently got the custodians after finishing the three waves of volunteers. I am absolutely amazed by her work and there are also many other notable authors. Jane Roberts. Edgar Cayce. Lois J Wetszel. There are so many great books and audio books on this subject I can write thread after thread. </p>

<p>The science proves it works, there are tons of research and data to back it up, and yet it&#39;s still kind of a behind the scenes thing and not many people are aware of this potential... It&#39;s because of society as a whole and the belief systems that have been constructed etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have convoluted universe book 1 but I&#39;m glad to know there&#39;s following books as well.</p>

<p>Thanks for typing out the transcription that was amazing.</p>

<p>Believe it or not I recently got a past life regression and I am curious to see what comes forth and if it will match up with some life circumstances.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing and much love brother </p>

I think it started with Nostradamus naming the cabal as the real moving force on the planet. There seems to be a gag order from that point onward in her books.

<p>I was on my 5th or 6th book from her when I quit reading her material entirely, specifically due to this lack of information on negative entities. While she conveys much info that is true and quite valuable,  the complete omission of  reference to negative power structures is a huge red flag.   That energetic dynamic is the most important aspect of our existence. Learning to overcome it will be our greatest achievement as Humans and by ignoring it,  she does us a great disservice.</p>

<p>Barbara Marciniak is now my favrorite source for knowledge in this vein.  She makes certain her readers/listeners understand their personal responsibilities when it comes to dealing with negative influences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, very happy to hear, that you share this view of her work. It kinda breaks my heart, because she is right on many accounts, but it&#39;s not the complete picture. When it becomes glaring, the lies begin with &quot;a new world&quot; (new world order?), we&#39;re here to blindly learn after countless incarnations (why would you want to repeat the first class 1 million times?). Michael Newton isn&#39;t reliable in this one either, same argument. The tibetan book of the dead or the remaining knowledge of the gnostics is much better here: there is a fake white inorganic light to lure you into complete amnesia and reincarnation as emotion-food (loosh) for negative entities/archons. They will also talk nice to you and want you to sign your next suffering with a soul contract. I got the books of Barbara and read a few lines, but now I should put it much higher in my bucket list of books. I think she was the one who at least mention and describe the cabal, same as Marshall Vian Summers in his first 3 books (there is no positive entity here to rescue you). </p>

<p>Dolores lied about Jesus too, I think. Much of what can be read in the NT is about Astrology, symbols and codes, it&#39;s not a biography. The Nostradamus books were interesting, they described ISIS (not in full of course) and their upcoming influence. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t wait for a happy &quot;new earth&quot; or for a &quot;coming shift&quot;. Just look around this sub, the cabal is coming down hard on free speech, commit atrocities, genocide, finalize the new world order (looks like third world war). Project blue beam sounds like what will happen at &quot;the shift&quot;, the last step before global governance.</p>

<p>We need to look at negative events and shine a light, nobody learns something new with being happy and in love with himself (new world religion).</p>

<p>It really is just my opinion,  but I think she was so blown away by the information she was getting that she never thought to question it&#39;s source or validity,  and therefore never applied the proper <strong>intent</strong> to her work. Our intent is extremely important, and we must declare it when we start interacting with unseen energies. If she began her work completely unaware of negative entities,  then never declared her intent to avoid being influenced by them,  all of her books might literally be demonically influenced, incorporating enough truth to seem legit but holding enough lies to prevent our evolution. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re  just getting into Barbara Marciniak, you can hear a lot of her channeling for free on YouTube. Most of the audio on there is pushed by folks that posted her CD material without permission and have stupid click-baity titles like &quot;Disaster In 2018&quot; when the recording was made 5 years ago.  Just ignore the idiots trying to make YouTube bucks from her material, she&#39;s not associated with that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They will also talk nice to you and want you to sign your next suffering with a soul contract. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a few of her recordings, Barbara discusses how to make an agreement with your higher aspects so that when we die we can escape the soul recycling process.  Awareness of what is happening and our declared intent is key in this matter as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now I&#39;m interested! I also think that Dolores didn&#39;t want to lie or lied herself. She was fed bullshit mixed with 95% of truth, in my estimation. For example some books regressing into aliens that consider the earth their garden - I don&#39;t think, that these aliens are all just positive. Archons were the first here too, before the human genome spread and modified humans to do their hard work for resources. I don&#39;t even think, that we need chakras, looks like a row of energy connectors to suck energy. Or we had many more, including a much bigger pineal gland, I don&#39;t know, but we&#39;re handicapped in this modified body. </p>

<p>Keepers of the garden reads like a whitewash for our &quot;controllers&quot;, there are no friendly buddies waiting on their spaceship to end this mess here. 
Jesus and the essenes doesn&#39;t match with the proven lie of the quetzalcoatl blueprint of ancient times and their astrological knowledge. They killed off any gnostic in the name of Jesus. </p>

<p>Yeshua Ben Yosef (the learned tzaddiki rebel) had a slightly different history,  including learning some things in Aegypt, not dying on a symbolic cross on a symbolic skull-mountain (to overcome the 4 elements into the 5th).</p>

<p>Between Life and Death might be the biggest hoax. I wish this was true. It&#39;s hard to find good literature on this, much seems fake to me. I need to read Barbaras information about this one. Thorwald Dethlefsen is in my mind very much knowledgeable about all of these information, but he didn&#39;t release much of his later knowledge, safe for some initiatives, he talks explicitely about Yaldabaoth, time as a curve, 4 causa, manifestation including every symptom etc. </p>

<p>Regression therapy might be a tainted way to obtain knowledge, you don&#39;t know, who is on the other end of the line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth officially the project was scrapped and EATR is no longer being actively developed. </p>

<p>Of course this could mean anything when it comes to DARPA so if doesn&#39;t mean we won&#39;t see something like this in the future, just probably not the near future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, hence the second bit of my comment. No doubt we&#39;ll see the tech used in some way eventually.</p>

<p>Also I only see people concerned about these things eating humans. My concern is that they do make some and limit them to vegetation, but then proceed to lose control of them. Can you imagine the ecological impact if we had an army of robots just consuming all plant life?</p>
