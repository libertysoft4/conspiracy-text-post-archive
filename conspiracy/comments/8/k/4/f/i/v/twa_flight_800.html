        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last night I watched a documentary about the TWA flight 800 that crashed/shot down near the coast of Long Island in July 1996.
Documentary is on amazon prime <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3040528/?ref_=nv_sr_1">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3040528/?ref_=nv_sr_1</a></p>

<p>It was a fascinating documentary, but I think it did leave out a lot of evidence that pointed to the central tank explosion and relied heavily on eyewitness reports - which are the least accurate.
Having said that, many people reported seeing a missile approach the
aircraft AND I have no reason not to believe that the FBI were bossing around the NTSB and tampering with evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right about witness testimony being generally inaccurate however when many people corroborate the same story it gets taken a lot more seriously. Remember this is why the CIA has to release the whole zoom climb video back then to explain to eyewitnesses what they saw. Except it never did and the radar tracks showed a primary blip falling straight out of the sky....that alone is one of the biggest pieces of evidence against the CWFT explosion. I was very much on the fence until I saw this documentary a few weeks ago...very interesting stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your response is just plain wrong. I spent a lot of time in the late 90’s early 2000’s inside 747 Center wing tanks doing bonding mods to prevent this sort of thing happening again. Nowadays any large aircraft has a nitrogen inerting system for the tanks as a preventative measure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll have to take your word for the first part of your response, though it is still interesting that the FAA had a fix when, in reality, nobody really knows what actually caused the ignition</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty&quot;</em>  Source - the above <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Flight_800">Wikipdea Article</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, it&#39;s interesting that you were doing modificatons to 747&#39;s in the &quot;late 90s early 2000&#39;s&quot;, when the fix was only proposed in 2008, well over a decade after the actual incident</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Accidents due to design deficiencies included TWA Flight 800, where a 747-100 exploded in mid-air on July 17, 1996, probably due to sparking electricity wires inside the fuel tank;[222] this finding led the FAA to propose a rule requiring installation of an inerting system in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in July 2008</em>  Source - Wikipdea: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747">Boeing 747</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, hey, I&#39;m just a guy on the internet and I might be wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The concord was a victim of an economy that no longer valued its place in the sky.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I argue that it was mostly the crash that contributed to it&#39;s demise, because what was widely reported afterwards was that it happened as a direct result of the inherently flawed design of the Concorde, not of any specific mechanical failure.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit that, after 9/11, all airlines were in a horrible slump for several years and passenger numbers across the board were way down for everyone.  So, yes, the economy played a part, but I do not believe it was the sole contributor.  </p>

<p>When in fact the aircraft were refitted and modified and returned to service. Your comment was misleading at least.</p>

<p>When the crash of TWA 800 only lead to, well, not much actually.</p>

<p>I was trying to compare and contrast those to events, the crash of TWA 800 and the crash of the Concorde.  Sure, I&#39;ll admit I could have worded that better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your response is just plain wrong. I spent a lot of time in the late 90’s early 2000’s inside 747 Center wing tanks doing bonding mods to prevent this sort of thing happening again. Nowadays any large aircraft has a nitrogen inerting system for the tanks as a preventative measure.</p>
