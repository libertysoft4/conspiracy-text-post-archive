<p>In July 2007, Gates met with Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah at his sumptuous palace in Jeddah and, Gates writes, “I lost my cool.” The evening began with a multi-course banquet in a room the size of six basketball courts with an Olympic size swimming pool in the middle. The ceiling above it was painted to look like the stars. The room had on one side a floor-to-ceiling aquarium 75 feet across and 30 feet high with exotic fish inside, including sharks. I’ve been there myself, it’s impressive.  </p>

<p>After the meal, Gates and the king met directly. The king railed against Iran and pushed for a full scale American military assault far beyond just its nuclear facilities. He threatened the Saudis would “go our own way” if Washington did not go to war. Iran, he often told visitors, was the source of the region’s problems and must be dealt with by force.  </p>

<p>Gates got angry. The king was “<strong>asking the United States to send its sons and daughters into a war with Iran…as if we were mercenaries”—as if American soldiers could be bought by a Middle East potentate or state to do its bidding. “He was asking us to shed American blood, but at no time did he suggest that any Saudi blood might be spilled.” America had two wars already in the region and did not need another. In his recollections, the SecDef says, “I was pretty wound up.”</strong>   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more like they have a symbiotic relationship with each other.</p>

<p>There is a &quot;protective&quot; shield around Israel, and as envisioned by the original creators of Sykot-Picot and The Balfour Declaration it is now coming to fruition. </p>

<p><strong>The House of Saud</strong>: The house of Saud links American and Israeli interests basically. It was created by the British and Lord Rothschild with the following explicit commands: <strong>Protect Israel, destroy any processes or movements that aim to create arab or muslim unity in the area (this is easy for the Saudis because they preach a salafist brand of islam that allows them to make anyone the state deems kaffir subject for jihad), keep your population dumb and docile, and finally, spread Salafism with &quot;soft power&quot; (funding)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Hashemite Jordan</strong> The so-called &quot;Hashemite&quot; kingdom in Jordan was one of the first nations to completely sell out the cause while the rest of the Arab nations were scrambling to come up with a plan to save Palestine. The Hashemites projected themselves as &quot;protectors&quot; of Jerusalem and the west bank. But in reality they had already agreed to give Jerusalem to the jews and have signed peace treaties before most countries. They kept these treaties secret so they could get destroy the Arab coalition from within.</p>

<p><strong>Egypt</strong> is the most co-opted of them all, because of years of cultural, religion, and cultural represession and regression, it has found itself in protection of Israel.  A position which is generally anti-ethical to Egyptians. Or at least it used to be. Egypt has/had the most secular/nationalist/rationalist approach to securing Palestine. Jamal Abdel Nasser created a functioning model for a national Arab state that can be self-sufficient and can contain multiple ethnicities and religions. He also pioneered the first major Arab unification project with Syria (This upset the Saudis so much that they tried to kill him in Damascus). Being that Egypt can produce thinkers and politcians that have a chance at actually stopping the project, it was decided to change it with years of dictatorship, years of corruption, and the creation of a &quot;counter culture&quot; dedicated towards Muslim Brother ideas. </p>

<p><strong>Iraq and Syria</strong> Well, we know how these ended up don&#39;t we? Iraq and Syria were the last remaining Arab states to push for Jerusalem being the capital of Palestine and to mount serious resistance efforts. Iraq was seen as &quot;too powerful&quot; by the Saudis and they have been directing the Americans to weaken them, and have paid out millions to Kurdish seperatists (This mainly happened in the King Fahd days when he was sponsoring Talabani in norther Iraq). There is a famous letter about this.</p>

<p><strong>Turkey</strong> has been suffering from a major identity crisis for the last century. It can&#39;t decide whether it wants to be secular, Muslim, rule the Muslim world, or just rule their own nation. If I had to describe the actions of Turkey it would be the famous mascot they like to use, that of the wolf, pretends to be your friend and protective, until no one is looking and it can rip a good chunk of your meat off your bone. </p>

<p>When you look at it things from this perspective it makes perfect sense. The fact that there is a MOC operation room in Amman, Jordan where Israel, US, and Saudis coordinate(d?) various efforts to overthrow the Syrian government in what it called <strong>Operation Southern Volcano</strong> in the south of Syria, and the presence of a similar operations room somewhere in Turkey (Probably involving Europeans and the hardline Kazakhs/Chechens etc that Erdogan has been supplying).   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here I need to bring the attention of all of you sincere truth-seekers to one of the most deadly controlled-opposition tactics vis-a-vis Zionist power in the US.</p>

<p>Israel being a &#39;client state&#39; of the US is one of the grandest successes of the Israel Lobby in disinformation and cointelpro of the century. Known Zionist-lite activists and gatekeepers peddle this myth that a country who drags the US into countless disastrous military campaigns which seek to achieve purely Likudnik strategic objectives that do the US no good whatsoever is somehow a &#39;client state&#39; or &#39;strategic asset&#39;.</p>

<p>There is no American lobby in Israel. It is Israel PACs which gather huge amounts of funds for federal election candidates in the US (Congress elections, mayoral elections, presidential elections etc). It is Zionist think tanks in the USA that have the power to continuously peddle the most ludicrous of Zionist propaganda year after year in tandem with each other. FDD/WINEP/JINSA/AEI etc are some of the most quoted sources in Western media despite their history of lies.</p>

<p>It was Zionist neocons. This cabalistic Zionist group, such as Wolfowitz, Feith, the Wurmers, Schultz and so on got into the Pentagon in 2001 and managed, via their direct personal links to the White House (Scooter Libby) and other arms of US government the DoD wouldn&#39;t usually have direct working relations with, to set up a fake intel-gathering office called the Office of Special Plans. It was this that generated the &#39;mobile chemical weapons lab&#39; myth, the &#39;yellowcake uranium from Niger&#39; myth (together with a forged document containing the signature of a retired Nigerian foreign minister) and utilized known fraudulent information sources for creating a case for war with Iraq (Ahmed Chalabi etc). They actually used fake intel coming directly from Israeli PM Ariel Sharon and acted as a conduit between it and the White House.</p>

<p>They also had their cohorts in the media to back up their &#39;revelations&#39;. Judith Miller was Scooter Libby&#39;s girlfriend, as I recall. The Weekly Standard, owned by either the Kristol or Kagan family, went hard on the Iraq war propaganda. Lots of different high-level American Jewish lobbying organizations also backed up the claims and clamored for war with Iraq.</p>

<p>None of this was involving US interests. The US military was not high in the list of strategists for the Iraq War nor did the Iraq War even produce any real benefits to the US (empowered Iran, although Iran is another enemy of the US just because Israel deems it one). In fact, it didn&#39;t even empower Israel the way it was expected to; sure they got an autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan (now defeated) to deal with (80% of Israel&#39;s oil was coming from Iraqi Kurdistan prior to the events of late 2017 with Iraq re-establishing its sovereignty over the Kurds) but by and large the invasion gave Iran a playing field to exert great influence.</p>

<p>True US military voices had been opposing this war, citing the destabilization as a quagmire for the US. <em>It isn&#39;t so-called &#39;client state&#39; Israeli troops who take the field for these wars or Israel who tanks the costs and blowback.</em> It&#39;s the US. The Israel is, in every single way, a complete hindrance. But it holds on to the US like a parasite because of Jewish dominance in the US.</p>

<p>Israel is NOT a client state.</p>
