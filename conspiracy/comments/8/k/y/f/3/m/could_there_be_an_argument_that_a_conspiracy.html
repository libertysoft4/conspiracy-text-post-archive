    <div class="md"><p>that is the most messed up part about going down the rabbit hole. </p>

<p>you would think we would all be nihilist.   But after you see what everyone else really believes in and all the evil they are willing to do without remorse. if you can add 1+ 1 you know something is up.  All the stories are basically the same and there must be some truth to them.  </p>

<p>it could be that double bluff where they make their caskets ahead of time so they have a place to be buried when they die in battle. 
Other side says shit they are not afraid to die they must know something we don&#39;t. </p>

<p>If you are brave enough  and willing to let go  you will breakthrough on some psychedelic like DMT or Salvia and you know that there is more to all of this than what we are  lead to believe.    and  i am sure the hole goes way deeper but i am exhausted </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atheism is a belief system. It postulates consciousness is secreted by the brain; atheists thus think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">hard problem of consciousness</a> can be reduced to synaptic impulses and neurotransmitters.</p>

<p>These beliefs are, of course, utterly unsubstantiated. They represent a minority viewpoint (across geography and history), and could even be considered preposterous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe">after properly thinking about it</a>.</p>

<p>Atheism is therefore a doctrinal belief system, i.e. a religion. Many people build their identities around it, like all religions. It is intimately tied to a given political ideology, like many other religions (in this case Marxism/Leninism).</p>

<p>You are probably confusing spirituality with religion, and imagine “god” as an anthropomorphic being sitting on a cloud. You should realize this is a primitive caricature; and that most of the world’s great thinkers have acknowledged the common spiritual denominator between science and philosophy.</p>

<p>Actually, this reminds me of something Albert Einstein wrote, where he describes what he sees as the three steps of theological maturity (my words) - i.e. the first stage of religious belief, for the most primitive people, are religions of fear. The second step are moral religions. Both the first and second idea of God are <strong>anthropomorphic</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Common to all these types is the anthropomorphic character of their conception of God. In general, only individuals of exceptional endowments, and exceptionally high-minded communities, rise to any considerable extent above this level. But there is a third stage of religious experience which belongs to all of them, even though it is rarely found in a pure form: I shall call it cosmic religious feeling. It is very difficult to elucidate this feeling to anyone who is entirely without it, especially as there is no anthropomorphic conception of God corresponding to it. (<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/aor/einstein/einsci.htm">source</a>).</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think it is. I think we may think it is rational, because the “identity” of <em>reason</em> has been tied to that of <em>materialism</em>. But this is a very contemporary phenomenon, and there is no philosophical reason for it. Plato is just as inspired as Aristotle; it’s just that Aristotelianism (materialism) favored the State in the 20th century (unlike centuries past, when State and Church weren’t as seggregated from one another). Materialism is a State religion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>until we have information otherwise</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, but we do. The materialistic existential worldview has, for all intents and purposes, been falsified by science. See the <a href="http://noosphere.princeton.edu/">Princeton Noosphere</a> results, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnA8GUtXpXY">Rupert Sheldrake&#39;s</a> statistical experiments, <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Epear/">Pear</a>, anything coming out of the <a href="http://www.noetic.org/">Institute of Noetic Sciences</a>, or indeed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_choice_quantum_eraser">quantum mechanics itself</a>.</p>

<p>But you are wrong to say that it is a religion due to that, for me at least I&#39;d say the brain if pushed for an answer but would still be open to evidence otherwise. Compare this to religion which doesn&#39;t change even with evidence showing it to be wrong</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Religion is dogmatic - certain beliefs and &quot;facts&quot; are passed down from authority and must be accepted without question. There&#39;s no arguing with a Christian that Jesus is the son of God that came to save Earth - it&#39;s part of the dogma. Atheism, at its purest, lacks any dogma, and is thus not a religion. Now, what atheists believe irl may vary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of protestants sects that arose believe in an versions of conspiracies, but by supernatural entities often working through secular institutions.  Take anti-catholic strands like seventh day adventists, they literally believe that there is a global conspiracy led by the pope who is the antichrist that is trying to outlaw worship on Saturdays!   </p>

<p>Go one step beyond that and you have a conspiracy of satan against god ala Paradise Lost and its derivatives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unitarian Universalism respects the dignity and worth of all people/life/existence. Discordianism is an inherently contradictory religion encouraging the creation of as many differing sects<del>ual positions</del> as possible as immortalized in the great phrase &quot;We must all stick apart.&quot; The Vesica Pisces, or Venn Diagram, is a good symbol for two singularities overlapping and providing the power output to create a new part of existence; it&#39;s also a good symbol for a vagina.</p>

<p>You can choose whatever you want to believe. You should not be afraid to feel your own emotions or live your own life. Your spiritual journey is your own. You believing the statement &quot;I am myself&quot; connects us the more strongly you believe it. There&#39;s always four choices; flight, fight, asking a question/inviting discussion, or breaking away in a measured retreat. Fighting can be performed fiercely, as a warrior, or dastardly with the dirtiest, most effective tricks, as a strategist. Only by appealing to peoples&#39; higher functions by getting them to talk can you truly hope to de-escalate a situation, otherwise you must withdraw. </p>

I identified strongly as non-religious before I realized that it was by the definitions of culture that I was dissociating the seemingly remote “God” of theists from the non-remote, experiential, personally wonder-inspiring complexity of “God” in the form of Mother Nature. Not giving a shit about the religious opinions of others is more important in a social context than anything else, IMO.</p>
