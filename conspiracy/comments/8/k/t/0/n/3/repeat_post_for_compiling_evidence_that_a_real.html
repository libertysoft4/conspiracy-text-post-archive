<p>Here you can post convincing and vivid imagery, video, and other media that let you know that this shooting could never be a staged drill/hoax, and give you the confidence to authoritatively put people in their place who suggest it might be a mere fabrication!</p>

<p>Those are 2 pretty huge stories within the past few days.
They probably deserve national attention &amp; some follow-up reporting, right?
Can you find any information about these stories on your news source(s) today?
How about the Santa Fe shooting? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What follow-up reporting can be done until the documents are made public, or at least available to the press?</p>

<p>Would you be willing to make a bet with me? Nothing crazy - let&#39;s say $250. There are services that will hold our money in escrow and empower an impartial third party to determine a winner based on strict guidelines that we both agree to beforehand. I&#39;m willing to cut you some slack, even - she doesn&#39;t even have to go to gitmo, just prison. How long do you think it will take? 5 years? Longer? I&#39;m completely serious about this - I think it would be fascinating, and if we both play our cards right we could potentially get some press for it.</p>

<p>That probably would have been a good approach with Trump/Russian collusion &amp; Stormy Daniels too, right? </p>

<p>This is exactly what we&#39;re waiting to find out. How on Earth would either of us have the full picture? In the event that they do have the grounds, they still won&#39;t have the nuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I suppose that’s a no as you continue to post on reddit without acknowledging me. This simply confirms what many of us know, you’re not looking for evidence you’re looking for something you can scream “no!! You’re wrong!!” Too...you seem to make similar threads after any shooting, asking for evidence, and seem to disappear when evidence is shown. It’s a shame, you try to appear or present yourself as wanting to have evidence presented to you then disappear when it is shown. Though I know you won’t, I’ll go ahead and ask you to stop making these threads after every shooting. If you want evidence that they happened you need to engage when faced with evidence instead of instantly abandoning the thread, or even creating multiple ones (like this instance). It’s pathetic, hurtful to victims, and transparent as hell. u/joe_jaywalker you’ve played your cards too obviously and your bluff has been called. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brooooooo....I’m asking you to RESPOND to the evidence that I posted in a thread ABOUT THIS EXACT TOPIC THAT YOUVE ALREADY CREATED yet you’ve abandoned that thread after I posted it for you. It’s not my job to re-post evidence just because you’ve abandoned YOUR OWN THREAD seemingly right as I posted said evidence</p>

<p>Here’s the part where you say “see you can’t post any evidence” and I’ll say that I already fucking did, you just chose to create a duplicate thread because you didn’t like your old one. Cmon man you’re coming off as a joke. So go ahead and respond to the evidence I’ve ALREADY posted in the thread YOU ALREADY created about THIS EXACT TOPIC. And don’t worry I already know your response to this comment will be something like “you typed so many words but no evidence” and I could repeat that you have already ignored my comment of evidence in a seperate thread of the exact same subject that you yourself created, then we could go through some itteration of that exact comment and response 5 times over. Quit your fucking dodging your transparency is horrific man, you’re only making yourself look scared of evidence or scared to engage in debate over evidence. So just don’t. Unless you respond to my evidence in the other thread I’ll just go ahead and respond to any comment you make with: “I’ve already posted in the thread YOU CREATED earlier with my evidence”.....it’s up to you to either go look at it or look like you’re plugging your ears and screaming “I can’t hear you!!” </p>
