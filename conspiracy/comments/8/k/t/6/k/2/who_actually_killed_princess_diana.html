<p>I know this is a question that is around ever since her tragic death, but after this royal wedding I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about  her. I don&#39;t want to make this too long, nor will I go in depth about everything I just want to raise awerness. To all of us it&#39;s clear that she was just there to produce an heir to the throne, prince Charels never loved her, he loved and was secretly sleeping with Camilla. You can see in her body language that she loved him, but Charels clearly ignored her. She was just so naive. Queen didn&#39;t want Charels to marry Camilla, so they had to find him a perfect &quot;match&quot;. And when they divorced, she started talking and the royal family had to &quot;take care&quot;of her. I think that this alone can make people question their marriage and realize that it was all for show and that nothing was real.</p>

<p>Thank you all for reading!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion it had a lot to do with Jimmy Saville (who was best friend of Prince Charles and serial child molester and necrophiliac) and the network of high level pedophiles surrounding UK government and the Royal family. Saville was very close to Diana</p>

<p><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2f/2b/6e/2f2b6e717234844ac59a82a15b504ddf.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2f/2b/6e/2f2b6e717234844ac59a82a15b504ddf.jpg</a></p>

<p>and was actually her and Charles&#39; marriage counselor. He had a key to the Palace for Christ sake.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/29/jimmy-savile-behaviour-prince-charles">https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/29/jimmy-savile-behaviour-prince-charles</a></p>

<p>I believe she caught on to what was going on eventually regarding blackmail and the UK power structure and was taken out because of it. She comes off to me as a very modern (at the time), polite, kindhearted woman who had intentions of doing good. </p>

<p>I believe Charles had her killed, whether for what she knew about Saville, marrying a Muslim man, etc. There was a lot of motives. </p>

<p>She allegedly wrote a letter saying Charles was &quot;planning an accident&quot; in her car.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/princess-diana-death-letter-prince-charles-accident-plan-car-paris-tunnel-crash-10-months-a7918671.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/princess-diana-death-letter-prince-charles-accident-plan-car-paris-tunnel-crash-10-months-a7918671.html</a></p>

<p>But there are a number of theories in total, I believe there was a conspiracy but hey, she definitely could&#39;ve died in a freak accident, but that letter seems to say otherwise.</p>

Look in to James Andanson, he was an MI6 assett fronting as a paparazzi photographer, his White Fiat Uno is the one that left the white impact paint on the mercedes limo&#39;s right hand side in the tunnel, and also confirmed was his rear light glass at the scene.</p>

<p>He was found in a field &quot;suicided&quot; literally with 2 bullets to the head. <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/12839/Diana-Fiat-driver-shot-in-the-head">https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/12839/Diana-Fiat-driver-shot-in-the-head</a></p>

<p>Diana stumbled across the pedophile ring operating out of Buckingham Palace among other places where people like Jimmy Saville (Charles &amp; Dianas marriage counselor LOL) and even the <em>butlers to the queen mum</em> brought sick and orphaned and poor children to a select group (Including Prince Andrew) to be abused.</p>

<p>If anyone has questions or wants elaboration reply here, but I suggest you do your own homework!</p>

<p>*Paul Kidd = Royal Butler arrested for grooming, and pedophilia.</p>

<p>Also look in to Ted Heath and many others since for the real scandal still covered up in the UK to this day.</p>

<p>And the fact that the one survivor of the crash said there was the white Uno with 2 or 3 people on board and a motorbike &amp; passenger which quickly overtook the Fiat and shone a very bright light at the drivers face then the Fiat nudged it into the pillar! </p>

<p>Also strange is the Mercedes Llmo drivers links to intelligence (MI6) and how he decided to change the route last minute to a longer journey through a section where EVERY security camera was glitchy or off (over 14 of them in the heart of Paris). </p>

<p>The best part is the very expensive independent investigation conducted by billionaire Mohamed Al-Fayed which came to the conclusion it was MI6 &amp; SAS joint op, I recommend watching some of Mohamed Al-Fayed&#39;s interviews on the subject.</p>

I wonder if the author is at work on digging up some more?</p>

<p>As for who did it, MI6 are the obvious candidates, but I don&#39;t think it was them. It would be too damn risky. My personal not-quite-belief-but-backed-up-with-some-circumstantial-evidence is that MI6 outsourced it to the Saudis.</p>

<p>The Windsors and Sauds are very close friends, and let&#39;s be quite honest, the Saudis would have no qualms about killing an ex-wife who was becoming a nuisance. I can go into this a bit more if anyone&#39;s interested (but they won&#39;t be, of course).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only just saw this post, apologies for the delay getting back to you.</p>

<p>Look at the connections of everyone involved:</p>

<p>1) The Royals - very close friends with the Sauds (Prince Charles especially)
2) Mohamed Fayed - mixed up in some very murky business involving the Sauds, a family called the al-Makhtums, and some other Arabs. Was also friends with the UK Royals for a while, through a shared love of racehorses, then they fell out and no-one knows why.
3) Henri Paul (chauffeur). The explanation given for the large amount of money in his pockets when he died was that, far from being an MI6 hand-out, this was a standard tip from one of the many wealthy Saudis with whom he was familiar (see: Inquest transcripts from 2008-9)
4) The Paris Ritz - thanks to Fayed&#39;s ownership, a regular home-from-home for visiting Arab dignitaries, who knew that their host would be culturally accommodating. A few Saudis under assumed names is not implausible as we know from 9/11 (again)
5) One of the British politicians whose career was ended by Fayed in the so-called &quot;Sleaze&quot; scandal of the mid-to-late 1990s was the house of Saud&#39;s main fixer in Britain. An arms dealer-cum-Cabinet-Minister called Jonathan Aitken. Look him up, and you&#39;ll be amazed at the number of dangerous deals he was involved in. </p>

<p>There&#39;s more (quite a lot more), but you don&#39;t need me telling you what to think. My own feeling is that when completely unrelated things all turn out to have the same thing in common, that thing that they have in common is more important than we are being told. Have a poke around the subject, see what your gut tells you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s so much wrong with any conspiracy around Diana&#39;s death. A) : She was no longer a member of the British Royal family . The Queen had removed her HRH title to make that clear. Though Diana was given permission to keep using the title Princess of Wales that would only be until either she or Charles remarried. Diana was free to do what she wanted and marry who she wanted, nobody cared. B) :  Diana and Dhodi were meant to stay the night at the Ritz that night. The decision to go back to his apartment was very much spur of the moment. The plan to use two cars, one as a decoy ,was made even later. Henri Paul was called back into work after finishing his shift earlier. Nobody knew he&#39;d spent his off time drinking. There was no time to organise any sort of ambush , it&#39;s just silly!!! C): Jimmy Saville was very well connected . Just because you knew the guy doesn&#39;t mean you shared his horrific perversions .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t see why point (A) is meant to be important at all, and it looks irrelevant; (B) is precisely where there is a very big question-mark hanging over Henri Paul&#39;s actions that night, and not even the Inquest resolved it.</p>

<p>As for (C), I don&#39;t believe that the Savile scandal is related to Di&#39;s demise. While it is true (as you imply) that paedophilia is not contagious, it is also unquestionably true that Savile cultivated people in high places in order to make himself &quot;untouchable.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Point A deals with motive. The Royals had gotten rid of Diana after long and intense negotiation with the divorce settlement. If Diana had anything explosive to bargain with she would&#39;ve used it then. At the time of her death Diana could do what she wanted and was discovering that being outside the Royal Family&#39;s umbrella of protection re the press was difficult . People forget how the press were turning on her and were reporting things like her phone stalking of an ex lover and her involvement in the marriage break up of the English Rugby captain . Stuff they wouldn&#39;t have touched while she was the darling of the Royal Family. During this time the upper ranks of British Society had turned their back on her , including her own family with whom she was estranged.  The Royal Family play the long game as far public relations go and are very good at it. If she had lived Diana would have been minimised to nothing more than a Anna Nicole Smith type controversial celebrity, outside the upper echelon of British society. The absolute last thing the British Royal Family wanted was her tragic death to turn her into Saint Diana! In other words they had zero motive to bump her off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just waffle. There is (or was, at the time) a very good reason for getting rid of Di post-divorce. The Church of England does not doctrinally recognise divorce, and regards remarrying as adultery.</p>

<p>I expect you don&#39;t see the significance of that. Let me refer you to the 1936 Abdication crisis, which was caused because the King wanted to marry a thrice-divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. </p>

<p>And, to wrap this up for you, the reason that divorce/adultery quibble matters is because the Monarch is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. As in, Charles is the next Supreme Governor and could not remarry without invalidating his governorship.</p>

<p>So yeah, everything you just typed is irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the issues with the Church of England were sorted before the divorce went through . Do you really believe the Queen would order her son and heir to divorce his wife if there was any chance he couldn&#39;t be crowned king ? Besides the timing of Diana&#39;s death doesn&#39;t make any sense. If they wanted to bump her off in a car accident why not do it before the divorce?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you have invented something that isn&#39;t accurate in order to point out that it is false.</p>

<p>The Queen did not &quot;order her son and heir to divorce his wife.&quot; On the contrary, she did everything in her power to dissuade him from going through with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but this is not true. After Diana&#39;s ill advised BBC television interview, where she questioned Charles&#39;s fitness to be king and seemed to be criticising the Queen herself, the Queen consulted with the Archbishop of Canterbury and wrote to both Charles and Diana and requestedthey divorce. Enough was enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but it <em>is</em> in fact true. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had been trying to paper over the cracks in the Charles-Di marriage for five years or so before the Queen finally wrote to advise them to seek an early divorce.</p>

<p>And no, that&#39;s not a vindication of your position. You originally claimed that the Queen &quot;ordered&quot; Charles to divorce Di -- and your claim was not true. (Which is why you&#39;ve now quietly changed it to &quot;requested&quot;, hoping no-one would notice.) </p>

<p>Furthermore, you are now quoting very selectively from your hastily-googled sources (I suspect Wikipedia, which is notorious for producing this sort of garbled hodge-podge).</p>

<p>The Queen did not &quot;request&quot; they divorce. What she actually requested by writing separately to Charles <em>and to Di</em> (i.e., not just her &quot;son and heir&quot;) was that Charles and Di got divorced <em>early.</em> </p>

<p>The slow disintegration of their marriage was known to be headed for divorce in the long run, and the disintegration the Charles-Di relationship was damaging the institution of the monarchy itself more and more as time went on. By 1995, the Queen was forced into damage limitation mode.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard a theory on the HLI threads she tried to stop <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/9%2F11%20beforehand/username/High%20Level%20Insider%20/">9/11 and was killed for it </a> </p>

<p>At first glance sounds fairly outlandish, no? Little bit of digging throws up some interesting connections..
The theory goes:
Diana found out about 9/11 through her association with fiancé Dodi Fayed, himself nephew to <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2001/11/six_degrees_of_adnan_khashoggi_part_4.html">Adnan Khashoggi</a> - who is connected to 9/11 in all kinds of ways. 
Definitely plausible at least, but admittedly it’s as incredible a theory as I’ve come across.. dig away..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could be wrong but Harry to me seems like the &#39;black sheep&#39; of the family, no pun intended lol. The rest of the Royal Family looks to play their roles but Harry seems different, I could be wrong and hes worse as them but seems like maybe Harry in the future could be play an important role in British Monarchy. In a ideal film world, Harry knows everything including the truth to his mother&#39;s death and just playing the waiting game to either destablish Royalty or to change it with his own hands in the future. And marrying a black girl is a good start. I just feel sorry for Meghan as she will enter the crazy royal world, she far more inexperienced compared to Diana. This would be overwhelming for her. In a century time, UK might have themselves a Black King or Queen but lets see what happens when Harry&#39;s bloodline next in line. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No way is Meghan less experienced than Diana. Diana was a shy teachers assistant when she married Charles; Meghan is an established TV actress.  And that still doesn&#39;t answer the question: why not stop the wedding instead of killing Meghan? It makes no sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That still makes no sense. Leaving aside the fact that you have no evidence of them doing anything illegal in the first place, if the royal family thought their secrets would be so easily discovered, it would still be easier to stop the wedding rather than risk killing her later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What needs explaining? Diana died in a car crash. Her car may or may not have been involved in a collision with another car. There&#39;s no evidence that the royal family had her killed or that she had any dirt on them. Even those who think she was murdered usually claim it was because the royal family didn&#39;t want her marrying a muslim or something like that, not that she was going to reveal something damaging. Given her known dislike for the royal family, if she&#39;d actually known something, why didn&#39;t she just reveal it? What was she waiting for?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of what you believe, they were still driving at 160kp/h and no one was wearing a seatbelt. If I was driving through a tunnel and someone shone an extremely bright light in my face, I feel I still would be able to control the car, come to a stop, maybe sideswap a wall but definitely not kill all my passengers. But hey, 160kp/h and no seatbelts would have different result.</p>

<p>The supposed suicide of the Fiat driver is extremely suspicious. </p>
