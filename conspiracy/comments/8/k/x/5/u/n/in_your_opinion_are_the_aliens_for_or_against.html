    <div class="md"><p>Conversationally demon/alien/angel/time traveller are all the same and the distinctions seem irrelevant to me.</p>

<p>I also refuse to call them more advanced and/or more intelligent in a general scope because to me any potential species that refuses love as the naturally ordered first principle of cosmic development (lets say..) is not only ignorant but also quite uninteresting.</p>

<p>And this one is a real pain point to me personally, because I don’t genuinely see or believe there exists any evidence at all for a “good side” with our best interests at heart with those interests being something like: love, intelligence, creativity, courage, honor, selfless teaching of knowledge, uplifting society.</p>

<p>Do I force myself, perhaps even as part of some coping mechanism to believe in a “good God” and angels that care? Yes, yes I do. Do I truly believe they do care? Or care enough to get in the fucking game and fight back? To show up in force for the few of us that really do what something awesome...??</p>

<p>Man idk I just don’t. 😐 </p>

<p>Unfortunately this cowardice evil force “we” are up against will make sure that you either submit to their ignorant cowardice or stand up and die for your beliefs.</p>

<p>One side has zero rules, unlimited resources, and values nothing at all.</p>

<p>The other side refuses to fight.</p>

<p>So we each have a choice to defend the weak side or chain yourself to the slavery of ignorant cowards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a common misconception that more advanced technology = more advanced species. Especially in this ancient aliens pop culture &#39;forget the hocus pocus about spirituality, knowledge, understanding and just give me the anti grav technology&quot; type mentality.</p>

<p>From a certain perspective the Conquistadors were more technologically advanced because they could sail the oceans, they could work harder metals, had muskets and cannons etc. But were they truly a &quot;more advanced&quot; or &quot;more civilized&quot; race&quot;? Not necessarily.  </p>

<p>At one point the Aztecs / Mayans could build massive megalithic structures and calculate time and astrological events with outrageous accuracy. But I guess a little bit of gunpowder goes a long way. </p>

<p>This is why technology divorced from ethics and spiritual maturity is threatening to destroy our earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very likely both. The Universe is likely teeming with life on different levels of development. The problem is that most people only see the possibility of material development and do not see the possibility and great importance of spiritual development. When that is taken into account the highest developed beings in the Cosmos would be deeply in touch with their divinity and experietally comprehend the intertwinement and unity of all things. Thus they would act from love and not hateful ignorance. However it is also likely we would find negatively oriented beings, especially those acting out of ignorance of the underlying interconnectedness of all things, which experimentally is felt as love.</p>

<p>I do think it&#39;s highly likely extraterrestrials are here and have been for a long time. If they know about Earth it is statistically more likely they have known about if for a while, rather than finding us just now, when we have come to this point in our development. Thus it is understandable why UFOs and extraterrestrials may appear in ancient art, myths and legends. </p>

<p>Many of these might also be beings that are interdimensional, but this is a difficult distinction to make really. Mainly because if you posit a multidimensional reality then you can see that all beings are by definition multidimensional. The only difference is awareness of said dimensions, as well as obtaining the proper scientific instruments to objectively measure and explore said dimensions. Most otherdimensional exploration is usually done through experience born from intense meditative practices, which is a more subjective method - but then again you have to ask yourself how objective these dimensions even are, especially when it is so often posited that the astral dimension (where beings supposedly go after the death of their physical bodies) is entirely based and manipulatable through thoughts - it basically consists of thought forms, making it subjective in many ways by default. The causal and upper planes/dimensions are usually deemed more stable and objective in esoteric teachings, but even in the astral realms objective consensus thought environments must exist (the consensus creation of the minds of multiple beings - Earth in a way is such a creation, but it is physical).</p>

<p>Either way, interesting question. Ultimately I can&#39;t say I know for sure either way, but I would say it&#39;s highly likely that there are both positive and negatively oriented extraterrestrials - and I&#39;d even say this differs within each group/species of extraterrestrials. After all not all humans are evil and neither are all of them good (if we look at it on the physcial level of species and not from a deeper level of being). The Universe is not black or white, it&#39;s usually both and everything in between as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would definitely not call it a computer projection, but sooner a consciousness projection. However you can liken it to a computet projection in metaphor my opinion, however I would say that computers as we know them now don&#39;t have much to do with creating our Universe (unless again, they are seen as a metaphor) .</p>

<p>In my view the Cosmos is holographic and in a way could be dubbed a simulation, a video game of sorts. But all of those are again metaphors. The closest to the real thing would be saying simply that the Cosmos is a reality based on information or thought forms, which structure it. Thus you could say it&#39;s a holographic peojection that stems from the collective consciousness of all individual beings that inhabit the it, as well as the ultimate Pleroma reality that all these beings are a par of. That which is you and I ultimately and is within and beyond all things. Source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We share 98% of our DNA with Monkeys. Thats only 2% where we are different then them. Yet a Monkey is for us clearly an Animal, we do not give it intelligence nor Personhood. We have arguably more in common with a Archeae Phage then with any Alien life. We are as of now a Planetary Species. That means we cant really efficiantly reach beyond our own atmosphere.</p>

<p>A Species that has mastered Faster than light travel (interstellar technology level) are the only ones who could theoretically interact with us now would definetly not look at us like equals. Depending on their level of technology it would be comparable on how we look at people from the Middleages, how we view monkeys or in an extreme case how we look at Ants. So the less advanced they are the more likely they are going to be Curious about us (for better or worse) and the more advanced they are the more likely they just dont care about us (do you stop and try to communicate with every ant and anthill you see? No, you usually let them do their thing. Also its unlikely you would have a picnic next to a fireanthill (we are the fireants in that context))</p>

<p>Technology and science would be the only thing that would give some sort of common ground. Currently we are emitting clearly &quot;intelligence&quot; in form of Radiosignals and artificial Neutrinos from nuclear reactors, nuclear weapons testing and Particle Accelerator experiments.</p>

<p>Alien life is quite ubiquitous in the universe, intelligent life aswell. Just look at our planet, we have plenty of species in every genera that display intelligence and ability to learn and adept. But we are very very picky in what we ascribe intelligence to. Aliens may do the same to us and just view us as Animals. We have nothing to offer and little to nothing in common to a Sufficiently advanced race. So i dont think they actually care about making first contact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats what i mean exactly.</p>

<p>A sufficiently advanced species will likely have &quot;evolved&quot; even further and will compare us to themselves in this regard. With similar reasoning. Comparisons could be like &quot;well if they can actually build things that go faster than light....or figure out how to not die as individuals i mean that would be a start! But they cant, they dont even take their evolution into their own hands, I mean if they would, sure lets talk to them!&quot; </p>

<p>Drop a Child into the jungle and what you get after a few years is someone without Complex language, without technology and no sense of math or ability to socialize. Still human as you and me, exactly the same species with exactly the same potential but without that &quot;spark&quot; we call intelligent if it where not human in appearance we would dismiss it as a monkey.</p>

<p>Also my Ant comparison would be the Upper end, a species that may exist for Millions or Billions of years would be something we cannot even fathom. It is irrelevant if we see each other as intelligent. Its important that &quot;they&quot; do that too. because there is no guarantee that Aliens are &quot;enlightened&quot; beings that wont harm &quot;lower&quot; lifeforms. </p>

<p>My point is that for any sort of meaningful &quot;contact&quot; we need to be at a similar technological level. Like if A planet nearby (within lets say 15 lightyears) is suddenly starting to send faint radiosignals. We can assume that by the time they receive our signals they are at the point we are now. We could totally work with that. Otherwise we have to wait and see when we can crack Faster than light technology. Then we have to have a very serious discussion about what we do when we encounter alien life. But for now, its not the most important topic :)</p>

Multiple types of alien races have achieved immortality in very simply ways they are waiting for us to develop this..  here is a quote from outer space “Unselfishness is the key to an intelligent race becoming immortal”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Asking if they are for or against humanity sort of ascribes humanness to them in the sense that you are saying they have to either like or dislike us.
But consider that they may not any longer have a freewill such as we claim to have and that their relationship to humans could be as immutable as a mathematical relationship or the rules of geometry.
If that was the case then it would be unnecesary to have an opinion about humanity or an agenda, it would be like Fate unravelling itself naturally or gears turning. And the difference would be that we are incapable of seeing the gears or the strands of Fate but maybe the alien intelligence can and they travel down predestined paths that connect to Nodes in parallel universes. So if they want to do something in particular they would travel to the parallel universe adjacent to the one they occupied before in which their desired outcome was predestined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most abduction descriptions sound a lot like being on the receiving end of a wildlife survey &quot;tag and release&quot; type program. So they&#39;re observing an animal for a bit, tranquilize it, collect some samples, do a health check, make notes of some stats, provide some kind of antidote to the tranquilizer, and then hurry off on your way. Not exactly fun for the animal on the receiving end (or human in alien abduction), but harm is not intended.</p>

<p>If they&#39;re for us, it&#39;s in the way we&#39;re for keeping up wildlife preserves. (And that&#39;s why we haven&#39;t heard much from them.)</p>

<p>For the most part though, they seem fairly neutral.</p>

<p>If they were against us, it&#39;d have been done and over already with either with space rocks or some genetically engineered virus. So apparently that&#39;s not the case.</p>

<p>If the phenomenon is real and there are interstellar beings occasionally visiting Earth, we wont be on the same page until we develop interstellar travel ourselves. And then we&#39;ll soon know what all the rules are. (As we&#39;d be able to cause problems otherwise.)</p>
