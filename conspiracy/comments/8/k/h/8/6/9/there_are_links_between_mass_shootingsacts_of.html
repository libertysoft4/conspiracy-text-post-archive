<p>SS:  As more and more mass shootings and other acts of random mass violence occur, one common theme that doesn&#39;t seem to be going away is the medication that the shooter was on.  Often, these drugs are known to increase thoughts of suicide and cause bouts of panic attacks and other negative behavior, and sometimes anti-psychotic meds are prescribed alongside them to treat these bouts of behavior, such as klonopin.  Are SSRIs leading to an epidemic of mass shootings?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, we don&#39;t. Depression happens for a reason. If you&#39;re depressed it&#39;s because you need to make life changes. Without depression, I woulda never made the necessary life changes I&#39;ve made in the past few years. These meds toying with the chemicals in your brain is wrong in more ways than one. When you don&#39;t make the changes needs and take meds to &quot;force happiness&quot;.....</p>

<p>Well, if you&#39;re feeling down and have sad thoughts, combine that with meds that force you to be happy, your brain correlates that as the those dark thoughts as what makes you happy. Then you begin to &quot;feed&quot; off of it. Kinda hard to explain</p>

<p>The world is a shitty place for a lot of people and I understand the temptation to take drugs to try to escape it.  Some people take heroine, some alcohol, some are prescribed feel good pills, but they don&#39;t fix the underlying problem, they are an escape mechanism that only offers temporary relief and it&#39;s often worse when you come down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So can a truck on the freeway. It doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a sufficiently good response.</p>

<p>However, I do agree that pills can help for a time. I&#39;ve mostly dealt with pain medications, but I&#39;ve been prescribed SSRIs too. </p>

<p>I see two immediate dangers in long-term medication, both of which have taken me for quite a ride in my own struggles.</p>

<p>1) Illusion: True experience comes from present attention. Drugs can facilitate or inhibit the immediateness of your experience. Valium and most opiates make the world (and your pain) feel more distant. That&#39;s primarily how they appear to work. LSD, psilocybin, and many strains of cannabis put your awareness squarely at the present. One dimension creates illusion, the other untangles, to varying degrees and in different ways. Almost all of the meds I&#39;ve ever been prescribed have been of the kind that put distance between me and my experience. When you&#39;re in that state, you&#39;re oblivious to it. You&#39;re not sufficiently conscious, and also too comfortable to notice. Once you get off them, for one reason or another, reality rushes back in, and in that state, if you&#39;re vulnerable and resentful too, there&#39;s no knowing what you&#39;d feel compelled to do.</p>

<p>2) Addiction: Well, anything I can say about that has been said before. We get addicted to lots of things, but our relationship to the thing that compels us is always subjective and more complicated than we would assume. My inability to deal with my pain in a healthy and responsible way caused me to ignore pretty serious side-effects of the medication for several years. At one time, I even neglected to see the doctor after a loud crack in my spine because the pain subsided into my medication within the weekend, so I thought it couldn&#39;t have been that bad. Months later I learned that a bracket that holds my spine together broke in two places while tying my shoelaces that fateful night. Meds made me choose to ignore important signals from my body because I believed their illusion that &quot;everything is fine&quot; because I was addicted to the effects of the morphine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a dreadful circle, and again, one doesn&#39;t have to fall into it, but all too many do. Throw in a terrible childhood, a nihilistic attitude, and broken heart, and you got yourself a time-bomb.</p>

<p>The problem is that that is not an unusual combination these days. Whether all this is deliberately fostered or orchestrated is a debate I&#39;m not into, but it&#39;s a reality which is being politically milked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And it&#39;s pretty obvious too, that that happiness we&#39;re shortcutting to by habitually swallowing pills is not the real thing. It&#39;s an illusion of happiness, by blurring out negative perceptions about the outside world or the world within.</p>

<p>Not that I&#39;m against pills or anti-depressant medication in general. They helped me through a difficult time, but they should really be viewed as temporary crutches that support you on your early steps towards improving your life as a conscious individual. Then again, making the choice to embark on a path of self-improvement and self-liberation is often medication enough to begin to improve on your mood. </p>

<p>A healthy diet helps too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SSRIs are touted as a safer alternative to other antidepressants. </p>

<p>I was on a 10 mg dose for 2 years. Around the 18 month mark I realized that I felt bright sadness or joy. I was indifferent. Special holiday? Indifferent. Graduated college? Indifferent. I didn’t care any more. 
For selfish reasons, I thought “if I can’t enjoy Christmas and want to bake cookies and do the things I used to, what’s the point of taking this drug so I can go out more (I have moderate social anxiety). Took 6 months of cutting the pills in half and then quarters to try avoid the side effects of stopping it.</p>

<p>Cutting the pills down did help, but I still experienced brain buzzes, brain fog, and huge mood swings. I had a short temper that went explosive. My anxiety got worse, which I found out was a rebound effect (if you take the drug for depression or anxiety, there will be a rebound period that the symptoms may get worse after stopping). </p>

<p>If my kids ever got to the point of being recommended one of these drugs I would say no. It’s normal for people to go through periods of up and down and teens are no exception. If my kid was being bullied like most of these shooters, they wouldn’t go to that school. If need be, we would move from the area and let them start a new life somewhere else.</p>

<p>That is because moral condemnation, even if biological in nature, is not a medical diagnosis. Psychiatric &quot;diseases&quot; are hard to &quot;treat&quot; because they don&#39;t exist in the first place.</p>

*stripped of their clothing and belonging 
*being forced to take exotic and sedating drugs against their will
*forced to stay inside all day, with limited access to entertainment
*under 24/7 surveillance, can&#39;t even sleep without having a light shone in the face

<p>What objective, clinical, laboratory style test do you do to perform to determine which classification they should fall under?

<p>Show me, then. I&#39;ve never heard of a doctor being held liable for the actions of their patient. We are discussing the topic of people committing violent acts while on or recently on a prescription drug, so show me that is the case. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humans aren&#39;t immortal. You seem to feel medical care itself is useless and that penicillin was a mistake.</p>

<p>Humans are flawed, just like their personalities at times. Unlikable behavior doesn&#39;t prove biological dysfunction like psychiatrists try to claim. Penicillin is used to treat observable ailments, with a predictable etiology, pathology, and prognosis. </p>

<p>If someone has social anxiety or depression, and they drink alcohol to relieve them of that suffering, does that make booze a medicine?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reinforces my point. Go to a psychiatric hospital and see it for yourself. You seem to be making assumptions about the healthcare today. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Psychiatric hospitals are political prisons for the disliked people. It is a highly stressful environment which confers conflict. There is a lot of homeless people and unfortunately psychiatry influences them because it is the only way for them to get help. People are treated better in prisons than mental hospitals, the mental health system is an absolute blight upon humanity in every sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before 50 years, people were chained up and stuffs since people didn&#39;t understand psychiatric diseases and no medications were available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Total bullshit. Psychiatry as a government institution is at least 200 years old, and goes back further to ancient Greece. Modern psychiatric &quot;hospitals&quot; will gladly chain you up and use restraints and violence if you refuse to take their drugs. The lack of empiricism and viewing of patients as sub-human is still the same, nothing has changed except now the drugs are more powerful and dangerous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reducing morbidity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no disease, it is a response to the environment. You can&#39;t prove any of your patients have a single damaged brain cell. Moral condemnation, even if biological in nature, is never a valid form of medical diagnosis. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The model that you have to pay a specific amount for everyday to the insurance</p>

<p>How about the model where all drugs are legal without a prescription, those accused of wrongdoing are handled by the courts instead of hospitals, and doctors are no longer worshiped as moral champions like priests?</p>

<p>Did I learn that in Wikipedia? No, and who is &quot;everyone except me&quot; who says otherwise?</p>

<p>It&#39;s common knowledge that the MAOI&#39;s are the most efficacious followed by the tricyclics.</p>

<p>Teenagers are prone to psychiatric illnesses such as depression, Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. You seem to have the wrong idea.</p>

<p>Chlorpromazine is a benzodiazepine, anxiolytic and also used in alcohol widthdrawl. This drug doesn&#39;t have anything to do with depression. The half life is 30 hours and its sedating. Short acting Benzodiazepines are preferred in treating insomnia associated with depression.</p>

<p>Chlorpromazine was the first antipsychotic ever, was developed in France. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a benzodiazepine, it&#39;s a phenothiazine antipsychotic and isn&#39;t used in alcohol withdrawal at all. It also isn&#39;t an anxiolytic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s commonly known as Thorazine - or Largatil here in Australia. </p>

<p>Again ECT is for treatment refractory cases. Not a lot of patients with less severity will consent to that since its a bit invasive than the easier treatment in tablet form.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve met many patients that will choose ECT over pharmaceuticals since it&#39;s more effective and they don&#39;t have to endure the side effects of drugs. Plus I&#39;ve had 24 treatments myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the biggest reason we keep seeing these shootings is because we now live in a &quot;information age&quot; where the news only talks about the mass shootings after they happen.. Then when a disturbed psycho kid sees that other kids have done it, it makes it easier for them to say to themsleves &quot;well if they can do it then i can too&quot;.. Its gotta be something like that because this shit didn&#39;t happen back in the day. Our society and children are sick and i believe the media and the wrong kind of music is not helping them.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I told them of i was bipolar, it was because of the duality of life.
You can&#39;t fix yourself with drugs, only change your level of awareness.
Becoming aware of this fact helps to increase your level of awareness. 
When we rationalize our own irrational thoughts, when we allow ourselves to be victims we are doing just that, allowing ourselves.
How we choose to react to things is what causes these illnesses.
Let me elaborate
You can take heroin, or an SSRI everyday for an extended period, and your body and brain become used to it and adapt to attempt to achieve homeostasis.
Well when we think, and feel emotions, chemical responses are created in the brain, dopamine and oxytocin for love as an example.
So people that continuously think negative thoughts, who indulge in their own negative emotions or what is or appears to be the negativity of other people, everyday,  all day, their brains adapt.
They become used to the negativity,  and their brains do as well.
Just like a person artificially programming their brains and bodies with drugs, one programs their brain with negative thoughts/indulgence in negative emotions
They get used to it, and become comfortable with it.
They don&#39;t look inside of themselves for happiness, and choose to see everything in a bad way.
If someone has felt this kind of way their whole life, imagine the effect on their brains, and on their mental stability...
I used to be a very angry person,  always aware of the evil in this world.
I left the negativity behind, traveled tbe country living out of a back pack, s did some studying andresearch into spiritual matters, NOT RELIGION, and i have reprogrammed my brain to be positive.
I still fight anger, but no longer depression.
Drugs may help one realize tbe problem,but they WON&#39;T FIX IT.
We have to do that ourselves</p>
