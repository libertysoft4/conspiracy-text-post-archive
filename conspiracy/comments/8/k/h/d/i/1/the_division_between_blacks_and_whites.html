On the YouTube videos revealing his identity, all the most liked comments are people pointing out &quot;of course he&#39;s white&quot; and &quot;sounds about white&quot;. The race of this shooter or any shooter does not matter.
It&#39;s the fact that lives are lost, and we are beginning to forget this as a society. Whoever wants to see this country divided is laughing to themselves right now.
 &quot;black vs white, left vs right, are the made up fights for those who&#39;d prefer to stay out of sight&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like a hard sell.  People that have guns tend to really like having them (for various reasons), and even getting to Australia&#39;s level of gun control is going to be like pulling teeth.</p>

<p>It would be nice if the government made some moves on mental health care though.  If the problem is a troubled young man with a gun, and we can&#39;t or won&#39;t do anything about the gun, then we should <em>at least</em> try to do something about the troubled young man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For starters: “white” is a very broad term and classification into white or non white is a very american practice. What&#39;s considered white today by modern standards is blond hair, blue eyes, paler skin, anglo saxon, and decent from ireland, scotland, germany, england, all the nordic countries, basically, all of north and central europe. Far south east europe, is were things get…messy.</p>

<p>Yes and no. Greeks are a simply mixed people, with original decendants from the middle east and central Europe, Overtime, due to the waring history of Greece and the mixing with friend and foe countries, greece became very diverse in terms of colour. Because of this, some greeks are pale skinned, and some are very dark (ex. Like those from islands like crete, who didnt get much exposure from europe, but more from the middle east, and a small bit from north africa). However, many greeks like to consider themselves white, because they are fascinated with the idea of becoming modernly westernized. This is truly a shame, because in being “wanna-be&quot; whites, they have lost there cultural identity, their religon(EASTERN orthodox church), and their money. I would say greeeks are of theeeee euro-mediteranian middle/near east background, and fall into the category of Lebanese, Syrians, etc.</p>

<p>(If we are talking regions, I would say some sicilians of Italy also fall into this category.)</p>

<p>Whether you want to consider this “white” is up to you, as it seems that the title “white” is more of a social and visual appearance title, not a genetic one.</p>

<p>Of course in the MSM this potential relationship is never discussed or explored with any depth or analysis. At most it gets mentioned in passing. Why aren&#39;t there any black shooters if they are as violent as they are continually portrayed? Why are all of the shooters white? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s because on th whole there are more white students in school in the first place, they have less of a dropout rate. Also these people were all bullied or disenfranchised in some way; I think blacks are bullied way less often then white kids. Also guns; the white kids are more likely to have parents in their home/life and those parents are more likely to have firearms.</p>
