    <div class="md"><p>You have no idea then. I&#39;ve seen what has happened to other subs on Reddit. I was in r/sandersforpresident when CTR first appeared, when it was shut down at behest of the Clinton team. I was in r/politics when it changed during the Dem Convention. I saw r/wikileaks mods change overnight and ban all discussion of Assange&#39;s whereabouts in October of &#39;16, I saw r/pizzagate get shut down.</p>

<p>I saw, and was a part, of these waves of users who found their way here- where these things could still be discussed. Sorry this is a <em>conspiracy</em> sub, where people are allowed to post their thoughts on stuff most consider to be &quot;out there&quot;. Sorry not everyone here is a Corporatist. </p>

<p>And to preempt the usual attacks from others- No, I&#39;m not a Conservative, I didn&#39;t vote for Trump or HRC, and I won&#39;t forgive nor forget what the Centrists did to Bernie and to this Country. </p>

<p>If you mean Russia collusions, that&#39;s because there&#39;s reasons to distrust it from those who support Trump, obviously, but also those of us on the Left who see it as the ultimate distraction from the failures of the DNC and the Corporatists, as an excuse to not change their failed policies, and shift the blame from HRC and her shit campaign to the &quot;Russians&quot;. </p>

<p>No, no I&#39;m not. I criticize Trump for his Oligarchial cabinet picks and his failed Foreign/Domestic Policy...but I&#39;m also not forgiving the Party, because they&#39;re gonna try and shove another HRC down our throats with Kamala Harris or Deval Patrick of Joe Kennedy III, and nothing will ever change.

<p>Shows your ignorance. Tom Perez wont the race for Chair, they booted Bernie&#39;s picks from the DNC rules commission, and are ignoring the calls to eliminate super-delegates. You are highly uninformed. Also- the Primaries have jack shit to do with the DNC leadership- which is firmly Corporatist. We made some good gains this Tuesday, mostly to to Our Revolution which was founded by Bernie and his former campaign staff, but the battle is just getting started.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that there&#39;s no difference between a Millionaire and Billionaire being President?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, were you anti-Bernie and anti-Obama as both their net worth were over a million dollars? It seems to me like you&#39;re &quot;anti-corp&quot; spiel doesn&#39;t really apply when most of the leadership has been wealthy in America (a capitalist state).</p>

<p>Now, if we were communist and the leaders all had massive amounts of private wealth, questions could be raised, but in America, speech = money.</p>

<p>No, because his net worth before Jane&#39;s inheritance wasn&#39;t over $1 million, he has a mortgage on his Vermont home, and lives modestly.</p>

<p>Yes, because Obama is a Corporate Centrist.</p>

<p>Transhumanism is the belief that Progress is <em>always</em> good, when that&#39;s not the Truth. Again I ask- what cost must we pay for this deathless utopia? What of our Humanity must we sacrifice? Have you ever considered that?</p>

<p>Death. Do I need to spell it out? D-E-A-T-H.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At what cost?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably a few trillion dollars. Jk. I honestly don&#39;t know the cost. Let&#39;s ask the Amish how much it costs not to implement technology into their &quot;society&quot;. Sure, there&#39;s more &quot;society&quot;, but way less technology. If we were all Amish, pretty sure we wouldn&#39;t have MRI machines.</p>

<p>Where the hell did you read that?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Loads and loads of burning money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What of our Humanity must we sacrifice</p>

<p>Meh, what parts of humanity have we sacrificed already? I mean, is it inhuman to allow an early born child to live? 100 years ago, we&#39;d normally just let them die, but thanks to that modern technology, we&#39;re saving these people and &quot;sacrificing&quot; humanity by delaying the deaths.</p>

<p>Of course, but then quickly realized how fundamental shifts were made in society when new technology exists. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the condition of all biological beings. Personally, I believe the Human Condition is better understood as the conflict between our Conscious mind with our subconscious instincts, which has existed since our earliest human ancestors began their mental journey out of the jungle. </p>

<p>Death is but a part of life- why fear it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I honestly don&#39;t know the cost</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is something you should think a lot more deeply about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we were all Amish, pretty sure we wouldn&#39;t have MRI machines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False dichotomy. What you are talking about is merging the biological with the technological, and sacrificing the biological, ultimately. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve really considered the implications here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where the hell did you read that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To believe that man and machine must merge, that technology will cure death and be our ultimate savior, is the essence of Transhumanism. You should familiarize yourself with leaders in this field, like Ray Kurzweil, who is currently a member of Google.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Loads and loads of burning money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you are ignorant of Reality and what I&#39;m trying to get at. Material costs are irrelevant- what of our <em>humanity</em> must we sacrifice? Do you even understand this concept?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meh, what parts of humanity have we sacrificed already? I mean, is it inhuman to allow an early born child to live? 100 years ago, we&#39;d normally just let them die, but thanks to that modern technology, we&#39;re saving these people and &quot;sacrificing&quot; humanity by delaying the deaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All while still remaining biological beings. You seek to end biology. That&#39;s a totally different best.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, but then quickly realized how fundamental shifts were made in society when new technology exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the belief that all change is good. Highly flawed yet steadfastly held by you, at least as you come across in these psots.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Says the dude that needs death spelled out xD</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand and, unlike you, <em>accept</em> death. You fear it and cry out for technology to save you, without even realizing what that means. </p>

<p>No, I&#39;m saying that technology completely merging with Biology probably isn&#39;t the best way to go about this.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve accepted that I&#39;m a human being who is a biological creature. I&#39;ve come to terms with mortality and the realization that no one gets out of life alive. No one <em>wants</em> to die, but that&#39;s a part of lice.</p>
