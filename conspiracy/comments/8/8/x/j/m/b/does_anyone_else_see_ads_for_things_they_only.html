        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It’s late and this might get buried but I wanted to know if anyone has been seeing ads for things they don’t google, talk about or text about? I understand Facebook/Google listening to us through our microphones and have seen ads related to things I’ve had casual conversations about near my phone and seen ads for things I’ve googled and researched. But lately I see ads for very random things that I’ve recently thought about only in my mind and it’s creepy af. Here’s a couple examples: I live in a tropical climate where it never snows, the other day I randomly thought about the boots with spikes people wear when hiking on icy mountains...hadn’t watched any movies about icy mountains, hadn’t clicked on any articles or searched anything remotely related and it was a very fleeting thought while I was driving..an hour later I see several ads for hiking boots with spikes and a couple for trips to Antarctica. Another example, I’m walking in my neighborhood admiring the neighbors flowers and thinking how rare blue flowers are, next hour I see ads for blue flowers/seeds. This isn’t confirmation bias and it’s happening almost every day, has anyone else had this happen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, advertisers have been doing this for years but it&#39;s gotten worse. In the old movies you would unconsciously see product placement but now they literally focus on them purposely.  Like in Jurrasic World where they zoom in on all the Mercedes-Benz. I took a class in college out of curiosity and a lot of the stuff I learned I still spot and see today. For instance most slogans that you can recall or remember are 7 syllables or word. Nothing more. Look Home Depot or Lowe&#39;s, do you know their slogans?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol...I actually do not remember their slogans!</p>

<p>I&#39;m one of those odd people that advertising doesn&#39;t work on me. I have to be interested in or have already shopped for an item before an ad gets my attention. And usually by the time the ad gets to me I&#39;ve already got it.</p>

<p>The most obvious place you&#39;d think it would work is food. Does that ad for a pizza at 6pm make me call Domino&#39;s? No. It just prompts me that I&#39;m hungry and need to go to the kitchen and start dinner.</p>

Using an algorithm and location data it would be fairly easy to pinpoint just about anybody’s needs with eerie accuracy. You can guess things about your friends just by making simple observations, I feel like a machine that spies on you 24/7 would yield amazing results when it comes to guessing things about us. I don’t think we’re as unique or complicated as we imagine ourselves to be, nobody wants to feel average but we all share the vast majority of basic needs which can easily be extrapolated into specific products.</p>

<p>I think this is the best answer. It&#39;s eerie what they can guess about you personally, just based on the &quot;matrix&quot; of indicators they get from thousands of data points you give them, and then they associate your data with every other person that shows up as &quot;similar&quot;.</p>

<p>So, out of millions in your demographic category, if 20 other people that have very similar patterns of online interactions to yours, are searching for some kind of product, guess what? You want that product, and they will know it as soon or sooner as you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can test this by being random and doing something a little different, and telling no one, and not looking it up on anything connected to the internet. How connected are we to this spying network, and how blatant are they willing to use it to target us? Check out a book about playing the tuba from a library but don&#39;t google it at all; see if you get ads for repairing tubas. Start making pen drawings out of the blue. Will their ad network guess this and advertise drawing pads? Will the cameras around your house be able to tell what you&#39;re doing? &quot;That&#39;s a nice rendering, Dave. I think you&#39;ve improved a great deal&quot; says the camera on the wall. </p>

<p>We&#39;re not there, quite yet. At the moment, I doubt you&#39;ll even get tuba repair ads on your phone if you start subscribing to r/tuba on reddit on your desktop. However, if an algorithm has our thoughts down pat, I doubt they&#39;ll tip their hand by using it to show us crummy commercials. They probably have far more nefarious purposes for guessing our thoughts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome to the Matrix.</p>

<p>I was on the phone with my kid the other day. We live on separate coasts and often spend time on the phone absent conversation, like zoned out. We were both reading unrelated online content during a lull in the conversation. </p>

<p>Reading Instagram or some such, she used a word out loud that I was reading. </p>

<p>Simultaneously. </p>

<p>I call it the matrix. A server somewhere had a little glitch and I get a peek behind the curtain. </p>

<p>As far as seeing products you&#39;ve though about, yes indeed. Mine are conceptual usually, as my brain isn&#39;t visually oriented per se. I believe this could be suggestion and confirmation through all the unnoticed stimuli we are bombarded with all the time. Algorithm if anything.</p>

<p>The Baader-Meinhof&quot; phenomenon: noticing the Subaru model you test drove last week, or some analogous example. . Suddenly that word, object, or person start popping up everywhere. You start wondering how it was you never noticed so all these obnoxious Subarus! You decided those are for aggressive little fuck-boy cunts who want to drag race at the lights and you&#39;ve got to show them what&#39;s what in your bad-ass sleeper, the supercharged Audi S4... See you later, fuck-boy with the ole&#39; &quot;one in the pink, one in the stink&quot; bumper sticker. What a cunt he is. I&#39;m a different kind of cunt, you think to yourself. More the European car-cunt. </p>

<p>Having said that, I&#39;m super paranoid naturally, and have suspected foul play with things only thought of. AND I live near a bunch of military installations with secret technology. I have no reason to believe there&#39;s some coincidence. Sometimes. The meds are working. </p>

<p>ANYWAY, Tin foil hats have proven to restrict the transmission of... Bullshit. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m joshing you... good luck with either pill you choose. I chose a mood-stabilizer. But I&#39;m already woke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at the controversy over Facebook psychological profiling based on likes and interface behavior tracking. They can work up a statistically probably profile with very little information on a user. I would probably be willing to earn a million dollars just to bet that the ability to do this is not unique to Facebook.</p>

<p>They are predicting your mind based on your monitored motions. An algorithm can remember that you were on a page where a headline you were otherwise ignoring was talking about something to do with mountains. A statistically appropriate time later, an ad network knows it is time to show you an ad you might react to (which you did) because the concept may have since crossed your conscious mind (which it did, in the car).</p>

<p>This seems like magic, but it is really just indicative of the unacknowledged narrowness of each person&#39;s domestic enculturation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not outside the realm of possibility that there was predictive analytics at play. Even if you weren&#39;t specifically talking or searching for, say, mountain boots, it&#39;s possible that you did, or you were a part of some activity, that lead up to that event.</p>

<p>See this article from 2012 (time flies!) about Target&#39;s predictive marketing based on user data: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#4c5851986668">https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#4c5851986668</a></p>

<p>Obviously you can say &quot;I wasn&#39;t doing any of those things&quot; but without knowing the algorithms used by the advertising companies, you have no idea what data points they are tracking.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a cognitive bias element at play here. Maybe you don&#39;t recall or think you did anything that would lead to this behavior, but from a marketer&#39;s standpoint you were showing clear signals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right: This isn&#39;t mindreading, advertisers have set themselves up such that they can hijack people&#39;s associative reasoning systems.</p>

<p>They know that given OP&#39;s demographics and content consumption, they can get certain people into the mood to buy certain products. The products then appear as advertising just when the predictive programming kicks in.</p>

<p>OP might watch certain shows, and those shows cut a deal with advertisers to get people in the mood to buy hiking boots (maybe the sure-footed hero wore boots, or lost his footing on TV only to be saved by a booted person). The boot sales people know they have a certain window in which they can profit, so they boost online advertisement within that window.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, our thoughts can be precursors that anticipate &#39;real life&#39; events, including digital stimuli. Paranormal psychology experiments have verified this in various ways. Quantum physics has also discovered and portrayed these principals experimentally &amp; conceptually. Outside of the spiritual traditions of meditation and occult knowledge, this aspect of the mind is mostly unknown and untaught. Which is unfortunate, as I have found that people who spontaneously discover these predictive capacities within themselves (yogis call them siddhis) often encounter confusing difficulties given that the society is not organized around these intrinsic abilities of the mind to defy basic assumptions of linear causality. </p>
