    <div class="md"><p>Jesus is the same fictional Jesus from the LXX version of Zechariah.</p>

<p>Paul, who writes before the Gospels, only ever indicates 2 sources of Jesus info, Scripture (the LXX) and dream teachings.</p>

<p>Paul never indicates Cephas or anyone else was a disciple of Jesus. Apostle doesn&#39;t mean disciple.</p>

<p>Philo independently confirms Jesus is the same Jesus from the LXX version of Zechariah:</p>

I mean you can believe what you want to believe, I don’t care, but some atheists have this obsession about it. I mean if I were an atheist I wouldn’t spend time trying to disprove something I didn’t believe in anyway. I feel like my time could be better spent enjoying life instead of working to disprove something I don’t believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ark tale has to be the the most illogical pile of crap ever pushed on people. To believe the tale as a literal event is so ignorant it gives me doubt the critical thinking ability of adults. </p>

<p>The sheer volume of animals and the impossible task of &quot;two of each kind&quot; repopulating all the animals is ridiculous. Even without including that the only animals mentioned were within a few miles of the stories origin. </p>

<p>And he didn&#39;t save the fish. See salt water fish and fresh water fish wouldn&#39;t survive in a world filled with brackish water. Almost all fish would have perished.</p>

<p>Many bird species would have also required saving. Most birds can&#39;t stay aloft for months on end. Without a perch they too would have died of malnourishment and exhaustion. </p>

<p>I worry for adults who think this story is anything other than allegory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I say that because the Sumerian tale says they preserved the seed of mankind and animals. Seed could denote the actual seed not necessarily the physical bodies. Either way there&#39;s plenty of proof of a cataclysmic flood that happened.</p>

<p>No. No there isnt. And again you add a modern idea to fit the ancient tale. You imagine that some advanced race saved the dna and reseeded life here. </p>

<p>Could be a flood of gamma rays or of meteors. It is a fable and one can make up all sorts of variants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Sumerian myth is one paragraph. Out of their entire existence this amounts to squat. </p>

<p>For all you know that cuneiform writing could have been the equivalent to Days of Our Lives not a historical document. Noah&#39;s tale is just a reworking of that. No tv no movies, the stars and stories were the only real entertainment for millenia. They probably made up some great tales.</p>

<p>So basically one tale gave rise to it all.</p>

<p>But it is fun to pretend.</p>

<p>I feel like this might be completely ignoring why an atheist would choose to go out of their way to make sense out of or otherwise disprove a claim they do not prescribe to - They believe that the belief in religion has an adverse effect on society and probably their personal lives to a certain degree. They likely believe that the world might be a better place no only for themselves but everyone around them if they were able to convince people to agree with them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m personally agnostic in that I do not believe it is even possible for humanity to reach an informed conclusion on the existence of religious or otherwise supernatural beings. We literally lack the technology and reasoning to come to an informed conclusion at this time in our evolution, so we are best asking ourselves what beliefs might lead to the best good and lead to harmony with being and reality rather or not something exists for its own sake.</p>

<p>I side with Jordan Peterson, in that the Bible contains very dense and old lessons that help inform the society that has brought the greatest good into the currently known world (this is not to definitely state this is the truth, obviously an argument exists that of lot of technology and knowledge has been suppressed.) </p>

<p>This is not to ignore the horrible atrocities that have been committed in the name of God, but one could argue that different interpretations of the same text lead to very different actions which were fueled by very different morals. In fact, an atheist trying to convince you that religion is a detriment to this world and argues for the riddance of it would certainly site exactly that type of event.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a question of context. I would never go to a religious subreddit to argue that gods don&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>However, this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and if you believe, as I do, that all forms of superstition were invented by men, and that all cults and religions are conspiracies by the elites to enslave ordinary peoples&#39; minds and control their behaviour - then this is the obvious place to have a discussion about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree completely. To me, it seems like they do this because they fear what they don&#39;t understand. Many people are indoctrinated into a strict materialist worldview where anything that can&#39;t be quantified by contemporary scientific equipment is dismissed as &quot;unscientific&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, it is irrelevant whether Jesus existed or not (though I strongly believe he did). To me, the relevant question is whether the teachings attributed to Jesus have value. I know for a fact they do because I know the difference they have made in my life. </p>

<p>I feel sorry for people with no spiritual framework on which to shape their lives. I used to be one of them so I know how lost, scared, angry and alone many of them feel. Thus, it makes sense to me why they often lash out and attack those of us who who embrace spirituality to knock us down to their level. I love them anyway. That is the power of Christ&#39;s teachings. </p>
