        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen any updates about this case in a few weeks now, and I haven&#39;t seen anybody on here talking about this much at all, especially not lately. It just seems very odd to me that no video of him going into a restaurant or store to buy food has surfaced, and as far as I have noticed nobody has reported having seen him anywhere yet.  </p>

<p>It seems like they want to play this off as a man not getting a promotion having commited suicide, yet his body has not turned up anywhere as far as I have seen being reported on. I usually check in for updates on this story a few times a week and almost nothing has changed since the initial reports of his leaving work sick and then disappearing. How could a man with his job and clearances to access/study deadly diseases just go missing and nobody can find any evidence to what happened..?  Did he get &quot;disappeared&quot; for some unknown reason by the government? Did he get exposed to one of the diseases that he was studying and nobody wants to admit it? Did he steal something from his lab like information or samples of viruses and get away with it?</p>

<p>The lack of follow up articles and information on this case is very concerning in my opinion. Something like this being swept under the rug and forgotten about is even more concerning to me. If anybody has any good articles or theories relating to this case that they&#39;d like to share I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>He went home sick, and they used his sick leave for two weeks?  Why would you use an employees sick leave?  You would probably worry way before that.  And they found his dog, wallet, car and money in his house.  That sounds like he either didn&#39;t go home, or he never left the office.   I find is super odd that they used his sick leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this is very interesting. He told someone to &quot;erase my number from your phone&quot; or something like that. He didn&#39;t get a promotion he was expecting. Maybe he wanted to disappear? Strange that he left work early, unless maybe he was drugged or infected somehow?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah he told his neighbor to tell his wife (neighbors wife) to delete his phone number. Nobody really reported on what his relationship with his neighbors wife was, so it&#39;s hard to tell what he meant by that.. </p>

<p>The first week or so he was missing, his parents said that they had received a text message from him the morning of his disappearance, and it was reported on that it was a &quot;cryptic text message&quot; but his parents wouldn&#39;t release what the message was. When it finally came out, the &quot;cryptic text message&quot;  ended up only being &quot;are you awake?&quot; That he sent his mom at 5:21 a.m. as he was getting ready to go into work... Which doesn&#39;t seem that odd IMO but I guess it could have been weird for him to call her before work instead of after. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Maybe there was a love/relationship issue with the neighbor. Many people disappear and don&#39;t want to be found. Maybe he was gonna call his parents to say a final good bye or something.</p>

<p>Very strange no more news on this.  Was he married? Any kids?</p>

<p>Anyone looking for him?</p>

<p>I saw there was a 10K USD reward for info. But not sure who paid for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems that he was single, so as far as I can tell it&#39;s only really his parents actively looking for him.</p>

<p>Regarding the 10k reward, I copied this quote a while back out of the Atlanta Journal that the wording struck me as very oddly written for the circumstances being reported surrounding his disappearance.</p>

<p>&quot;Cunningham’s family has partnered with Crime Stoppers of Greater Atlanta to offer a $10,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and indictment in this case. Information can be submitted anonymously to the Crime Stoppers Atlanta tip line at 404-577-TIPS (8477) or online at <a href="http://www.crimestoppersatlanta.org">www.crimestoppersatlanta.org</a>. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that is very interesting. You would think a doc working for the CDC would have money laying around, why would they need to &quot;partner&quot; with crime stoppers?  Then again for all we know &quot;Crime Stoppers&quot; actively reached out 
 to them.</p>

<p>I think this guy just decided to disappear. This might be why there is no new news on him for months and months. It isn&#39;t an appealing story for the media that is only interested in clicks. I would be very interested in seeing his bank account activity and his travel activity if he happened to just say &quot;fuck it&quot; and leave the country.</p>

<p>If he got sick / poisoned he would have turned up. Also what is the status of his car? Home? etc. of course can&#39;t depend on the news for real facts but would love to know if he owned, rented, did he sell, etc.</p>

<p>If it were just a guy disappearing, or having commited suicide like the msm narrative tries to suggest. Why would there be any arrests or indictments made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, I think you are right to think that is strange but I also am not familiar with that organization. Is that their usual wording? Or did they only become involved in this case because it looks like a crime has been committed?</p>

<p>Here is the tldr quote of the reasoning it couldn&#39;t have been him that they say &quot;verifies&quot; it being debunked</p>

<p>&quot;Dr. Cunningham worked in the chronic disease unit, which is not the infectious disease unit, he had no access to classified material&quot;</p>

<p>Here is a link to his CDC page </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/spokesperson/sme-bio/cunningham.html">https://www.cdc.gov/media/spokesperson/sme-bio/cunningham.html</a></p>

<p>Here is a quote from that about some of his accomplishments</p>

<p>&quot;Dr. Cunningham has also deployed for numerous public health emergencies, including Superstorm Sandy, Ebola, and Zika.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why he would be deployed for Ebola and Zika outbreaks if he didn&#39;t work in the infectious disease unit. But then again I&#39;m not an epidemiologist or CDC employee :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this. I knew, of course it would  be ‘debunked’.  These things always are. The alternative media sources, that were the only ones to pick up the story, if he <em>did</em> try to actually report it, were questioned. But, it just seems odd they would come up with that story on their own like that. </p>

<p>There have also been conflicting reports on the supposed promotion. Police assert they <em>were</em> told he had been denied a promotion, then later cdc  said he <em>had</em> received the promotion some time in the past. </p>

<p>The message to neighbor to delete his number from their phone is very, very odd. What would make someone do that?  </p>

<p>As far as his specialty being chronic illness, it was flu season, he had been tasked with dealing with infectious emergencies in the past. </p>

<p>Aaaaand, this year’s flu vaccine was problematic. Very ineffective and associated with deaths of healthy ppl. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the job promotion conflicting information, that is because he both had recently gotten a promotion but more recently had been turned down for a promotion. The first was to the position of Commander in July, which he did receive.
The second promotion was to Branch Manager, that he applied for in January, which he was turned down for a week before he disappeared. So the CDC director wasn&#39;t technically lying by saying both were true.</p>

<p>But yeah I agree that it was weird how the CDC  handled the situation, and I&#39;m not exactly sure why they would do that.. only thing I can think is that they were trying to save face in case it did happen that he killed himself, by making it seem like he was being actively promoted  and that it wasn&#39;t their fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either that or he found out something about where the US is secretly working on them and that might have had something to do with the some of the known outbreaks that have occurred. </p>

<p>If any of the top people discovered that he did and was the type to blow the whistle they could have ordered something extreme to prevent him from doing that. I could also mean that something went wrong in handling a bioweapon that they don&#39;t want anyone to ever find out about and I mean &quot;ever&quot; and they took him over to the dark side to work for them uncover. </p>

<p>They do, and have been known to fake the deaths of certain scientists in order to do have them further develop their own work to help on top secret black projects with all the resources they could possibly ever want. With that kind of knowledge, however, they accept the necessity of having their past lives buried as well as being watched and accompanied on very limited excursions out in public.</p>

<p>The second part of your reply is similar to what happened with some of the Paperclip Nazis. Rumors about what might have happened to Hans Kammler come to mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A story came-out many years ago about a brilliant Canadian scientist who was something of a genius in his field and had been working for the Canadian government and suddenly disappeared amid a rash of accusations that he&#39;d been passing vital secrets to the Soviets and had just managed to defect just before they were about to arrest him for it. </p>

<p>His family never believed it and kept on trying to find out what happened to him while the Canadian government stone-walled them at ever turn. </p>

<p>It was almost 20 years later that one of them received a message from him that set-up a meeting where he had an hour to talk to them at a local park accompanied by his handlers and explained that they&#39;d finally conceded to let him do that and clear a few things up. </p>

<p>The claim that he&#39;d defected was a complete ruse and he&#39;d been chosen to work on what he was most interested and showed so much promise in secretly for the US in an unknown location. </p>

<p>He assured them that he was happy and well looked after having complete freedom and unlimited resources to work on things he&#39;d been interested in all of his life but it meant covering up his past in that unpleasant way to hide who he was actually working for and the loss of his private freedom in exchange for it. </p>

<p>He also said he wouldn&#39;t be able to meet with them again, but wanted to give them the comfort of knowing that they were right and that he wasn&#39;t a traitor and hadn&#39;t defected and that it was just the opposite of that, in fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it&#39;s a somewhat tragic tale and full of pathos, which is to say it really borders on being pathetic and you&#39;re perfectly right about the idea of him keeping his discoveries &quot;out of the wrong hands&quot; as not simply being &quot;subjective&quot; but what I&#39;d consider to be a very shabby excuse for him as a scientist and the government he works for deliberately pursuing avenues of  knowledge that really only have incredibly destructive and inhuman applications. </p>

<p>Nightmarish applications that they will try to further justify by saying &quot;If we don&#39;t our enemies will if they already haven&#39;t.&quot; and sooner or later they&#39;ll deliberately leak some convincing information that actually insures that those so-called enemies will have to as a genuinely necessary deterrent for their own protection, no matter how abhorrent or unthinkable making or ever using such terrible weapons was to them before that became known to them.</p>

<p>That along with vilifying and portraying any so called enemy nations and everyone in them as being sick and inhuman monsters capable of such unthinkable things has been the US&#39; M.O. since WWII and the atom bomb with an absolutely staggering amount of spending on it that only proves that it has assembled the largest collection of such sick and inhuman monsters capable of creating such sickening and horrifying things all busily doing it for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah he told his neighbor to tell his wife (neighbors wife) to delete his phone number. Nobody really reported on what his relationship with his neighbors wife was, so it&#39;s hard to tell what he meant by that.. </p>

<p>The first week or so he was missing, his parents said that they had received a text message from him the morning of his disappearance, and it was reported on that it was a &quot;cryptic text message&quot; but his parents wouldn&#39;t release what the message was. When it finally came out, the &quot;cryptic text message&quot;  ended up only being &quot;are you awake?&quot; That he sent his mom at 5:21 a.m. as he was getting ready to go into work... Which doesn&#39;t seem that odd IMO but I guess it could have been weird for him to call her before work instead of after. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this. I knew, of course it would  be ‘debunked’.  These things always are. The alternative media sources, that were the only ones to pick up the story, if he <em>did</em> try to actually report it, were questioned.

<p>There have also been conflicting reports on the supposed promotion. Police assert they <em>were</em> told he had been denied a promotion, then later cdc  said he <em>had</em> received the promotion some time in the past. </p>

<p>The message to neighbor to delete his number from their phone is very, very odd. What would make someone do that?  </p>

<p>As far as his specialty being chronic illness, it was flu season, he had been tasked with dealing with infectious emergencies in the past. </p>
