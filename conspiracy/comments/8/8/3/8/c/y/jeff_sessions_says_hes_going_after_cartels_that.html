<p>The real reason they&#39;re going after illegals isn&#39;t because &#39;they want them out of the country&#39;, you&#39;ll find that they are just filling up the prisons, on the public&#39;s dime, to replace the lack of Cannabis arrests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For 8 yrs under Obama, Corrections Corporation of America &amp; The GEO Group were awarded BILLIONS of dollars in no-bid federal contracts. In August, 2016 (just before he&#39;s about to leave office) Obama writes: &quot;Today, I sent a memo to the Acting Director of the Bureau of Prisons directing that, as each private prison contract reaches the end of its term, the bureau should either decline to renew that contract or substantially reduce its scope in a manner consistent with law and the overall decline of the bureau’s inmate population.&quot; So fund private prisons for your entire two terms, then on the way out the door, write a memo. You, Obama and I know that is PURE LIP SERVICE.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You understand what I&#39;m saying? We knew we couldn&#39;t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,&quot; Ehrlichman said. &quot;We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you really demanding a source on the claim that drug laws are used to target racial minorities? Well, if that fact wasn&#39;t self-evident just by virtue of living in this country, there is an official from the Nixon administration admitting explicitly that the modern &quot;war on drugs&quot; was always meant to target racial minorities for disenfranchisement. He says that they deliberately intended to disrupt the communities of racial minorities and political dissidents by locking up community leaders and he even talks about how they used propaganda in the media to aid in that goal. Come on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but somehow, you need to get that marijuana from your dealer to your home to smoke it. In a routine traffic stop, an African American is more likely to be detained or requested a vehicle search than a white person, and we&#39;re similarly more likely (at least in Baltimore from the study I will try to find for you) to be pulled over for a vehicle violation (over tinted windows, things hanging from rearview) than whites. So yes, you won&#39;t get arrested for smoking in your living room, but it&#39;s not like the only people that have ever gotten arrested had a blunt hanging out their car window</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, and for proof of this, all we have to do is look at how the USA was before alcohol prohibition, how it was during alcohol prohibition, and how it returned to relative normalcy once alcohol prohibition was ended. It&#39;s not like we still have gang violence over rum runners competing for black market alcohol sales. Ending prohibition shut down the black market surrounding alcohol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I&#39;ve ways seen it put is that cannabis is like cash to cartels. It&#39;s bulky and not super lucrative, compared to heroin or coke, but by continuously moving it it gives them the funds they need to send the riskier shipments of harder, more lucrative drugs. I don&#39;t know that cannabis legality would kill the cartels but they&#39;d certainly take a hit. </p>

<p>I also think people would be likely to get wrapped up in other drugs if cannabis was available. People would be able to get cannabis and wouldn&#39;t find themselves slowly embroiled with the sort of people who also have coke or heroin. People could escape the underground that provides something as innocuous as marijuana but also more harmful drugs.</p>

<p>This is why the solution is to decriminalize ALL drugs and to stop locking up and enslaving people with drug habits. We should treat someone with a cocaine/meth/speed/whatever problem the same way we treat someone with an alcohol problem. </p>
