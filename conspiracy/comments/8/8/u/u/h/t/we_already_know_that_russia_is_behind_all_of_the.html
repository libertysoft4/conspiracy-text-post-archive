<p>Well, yeah, I do. It makes sense for them to do so, but mostly because the holes are so obvious to anyone that looks at them, and it makes sense for Russia to use them for their own purposes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, I was being cheeky and taking you too literally on purpose. Such is the nature of the day! Russia&#39;s influence on this topic has been like tossing some kindling into an already-raging house fire. </p>

<p>My only point is that Russia does fund and support US dissidents and views that go against the US corporate/bureaucratic power nexus because in at least a narrow window, their interests do align. And I&#39;m thankful for it. RT has given a platform to numerous US journalists and activists who never would have had a chance to say what they say on US-owned corporate media, including Abby Martin, Chris Hedges, Mike Papantonio, Lee Camp, Jesse Ventura, and others. </p>

<p>I have no illusions as to <em>why</em> Russia gives them a platform, and I certainly don&#39;t trust Russia, but without them, the US media landscape would be in a worse position than it already is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m completely aware that the US isn&#39;t necessarily good, but Russia isn&#39;t either. The US creates a ton of anti-Russian propaganda, and Russia has every right to create anti-US propaganda in turn. But that&#39;s the thing, it&#39;s probably isn&#39;t good to get caught in the middle. Hypothetically lets say Bush or Bin Laden or Russia did 9/11, so what, can you do anything about it? How can you or I make a difference?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, we make a difference by spreading the Truth. And the Truth is that 9/11 is not as it appears. The evidence points towards an internal job by our Elites and <em>not</em> the Russians. Saying the Russians did 9/11 only makes things worse and allows the degenerates that run this country to get away with further crimes. </p>
