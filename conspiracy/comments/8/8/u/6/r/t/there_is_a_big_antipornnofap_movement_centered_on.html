        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems in this country sex and &quot;free love&quot; has been the enemy for a while.  America uses sex as a carrot on a string to get it&#39;s people to work and consume.  Woman are taught by media that a man has to earn your love... either by being extremely witty charismatic and outgoing or, since most men aren&#39;t movie stars, buying something.</p>

<p>This worked for a time when the men were primary bread earners.  But now that you have equality between sexes the American system of using sex as a carrot to get men to work just.. well it doesn&#39;t work.  Women don&#39;t need men for support anymore but it&#39;s like the system doesn&#39;t know how to change so it&#39;s doubling down on the war on sex and drugs.  Ramping up violence...  Oh look out for this new asshole Jordan Peterson, too.  That guy is a total corporate &quot;work hard so you can be miserable like me&quot; shill.</p>

<p><strong>This was not a post saying violent video games are a problem, MORONS.  I play violent video games.  This was a post pointing out that there is more of a movement to combat porn and sexual themes in movies and games than there is gory violence.  You can all stop your brainwashed screeches now</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is really just stupid now aren&#39;t they?  I am not comparing violence to porn.  I&#39;m comparing the MOVEMENT against porn to the LACK OF MOVEMENT against violence.  Do you see the difference?</p>

<p>The WHOLE POINT OF THE POST is we have full movements around getting people to stop watching porn... and you hear all these studies about how bad porn is for you...  but you hear nothing about violence in media.  Nothing at all.  If you try and bring it up, a bunch of morons come in and try to argue with you but can&#39;t even comprehend what you are saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Find a credible study that links violent video games to violent tendencies that everyone is ignoring, right now your argument sounds like you are upset that everybody doesn’t think like you? </p>

<p>Maybe if there is a lack of actual evidence to support a connection between two things, then most level headed people won’t just make a blind assumption that there actually is one.</p>

<p>And you could change “violent video games” to any others issue you care about and basically shout at people for not sharing the same interest as you.... like if I said <em>“nofap shouldn’t be a thing because it’s dumb and besides that, why is no one talking about the illegal whale fishing around Antarctica”</em> does it sound like I really care about nofap or does it sound more like I’m using “nofap” as a stepping stone to bring attention to what I actually want to talk about <em>”anyone paying attention to X, should actually be focusing of Y”</em></p>

<p>In regards to your post itself, I’m not sure if you’re saying violent video games should be banned or that nofap shouldn’t be a thing, and because you’ve presented and defended it so poorly (which it’s clear in the comments that  I’m not the only one not understanding what you’re point is) it really just comes off as an anger fueled “what aboutism” type Post...... </p>

<p>If you try this a third time, maybe stick to one of the two issues you’re bringing up, make a post regarding a conspiracy about specifically nofap by itself or make one about violent videos games by themselves, the bridge you’ve built between the two
is too weak for anyone to follow you between the two issues </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you made a post with two main subjects, nofap and violent video games.... unfortunately your violent video game claims were so outlandish that is what everyone got stuck on.....</p>

<p>Maybe if you wanted to have an open minded conversation about nofap, then make a post that is solely focused on nofap..... your problem here was making a post about something that only a very small amount of people can relate to (nofap) and using it to attack something almost everyone can relate to (video games) and now you’re getting upset that people got stuck on the subject they can actually talk to...... if you want a discussion about a certain topic, then only talk about that topic, you literally invited everyone to ignore what you apparently wanted to talk about by giving them another option...... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I’ve been in that addiction before. I wouldn’t say porn is the problem I think masturbation is the problem and porn leads to masturbation. Masturbation makes you weaker, more irritable, and less motivated which leads to you not helping your community as much as you potentially could. I learn from experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Porn does not quite rewire the brain, it continues the wiring of the brain of the set agenda to how they want people to act and behave like. Calm, sexual, violent and love struck. These people know that yet they are saying it rewires. They won&#39;t tell the whole truth, brain does not get rewired it just keeps a continuation of a process of wiring (programming) it up in different flash images, sounds and words to create a false sense of a need of something like sex, gaming or even something not so unhealthy like fishing its all apart of our minds programming. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t take so much from articles like these as they tend to twist the story or rather brain wash any unsuspecting victim into a false belief like the &#39;rewiring of our brain&#39; title. It doesn&#39;t make sense and it isn&#39;t logical in that sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Tons of people are against violent video games. Unfortunately for them, there have been no conclusive studies showing a link between playing violent games and increased violence in a person, to my knowledge. Millions of people play violent video games and aren’t negatively impacted. In fact, games can help something’s like problem solving, multitasking, and hand eye coordination. The nofap thing is because a lot of people feel that masturbating an irregular amount, like multiple times a day every day for years, and watching porn just as much, has negatively impacted them. Many have said they’ve become desensitized due to the porn, finding it difficult for regular interactions to turn them on them. Other things people participating in nofap claim are that it negatively impacts attention span, it can be detrimental to your brain and your dopamine, it can make someone worse at social interactions, there can be impotence issues caused by the extremely frequent masturbation, etc.  </p>

<p>Bottom line is nofap is used by people that feel they masturbate and watch porn way too much, an irregular amount, and it negatively impacts their social skills, sex life, and can be detrimental to their overall health and well-being. This is from people who actually fap too much and are looking for help. Some feel addicted to it. Who is claiming violent video game use is detrimental? People that ignore studies proving the opposite, and usually people that don’t actually play any video games themselves. Not many people that claim violent video games cause violence are those that actually play video games.  </p>

<p>That distinction is important when comparing these two: the fact that nofap is “pushed” by people that fap too often and feel addicted to it and porn, vs the fact that violent video game crap is pushed by people looking for an excuse for violence, and not by actual violent game players themselves. Ones basically self help group, ones a campaign against games because of ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could write a whole essay on this but I will hold a bit back. Everything in life has pros and cons. Video games is like a conditioning tool, depending what you play especially at a young age if it is violent you will tend to be like that (kids are like sponges and from the moment they are born they take in everything life throws at them) violent but to act out on it or project it into society depends how your life is in my opinion and experience as well. It is just another paradigm to this set cycle of programming the masses to a set point for life. </p>

<p>Porn can be very unhealthy if you become addicted and its all your mind ever see is naked people fornicating or doing sexual acts it creates urges in people to go have sex and do sexual acts. You can see it in this world sex sells. They subtly say it in adds that sound sexual however it is indirect. If you want a world where rape, molestations and sexual trauma is nonexistence you need to take away things that plant these images and thoughts into the back of our minds or for people to not watch these things.</p>

<p>As sex goes for me it energetically deprives you from feeling at your best if you do it too much and being at peak form for certain events or just day to day well being of mind and body.</p>

<p>There are movies with a lot of sex in them and there are movies with a lot of gore/violence in them. Just like there is porn available online. It&#39;s OUR choice to either watch either of these things. No one is forcing you to sit and watch a violent movie and no one is forcing you to sit and watch porn. I grew up being obsessed with horror movies. But I would never hurt a fly. It all comes down to each person individually. But one thing I&#39;ll say is that weed has helped me develop great critical thinking skills and I can honestly say it changed my mentality for the better. I see things way more clearly now than before I started smoking. I&#39;m not trying to push for a pro-weed agenda, it&#39;s just a personal observation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, yeah I agree that they should be consistent with the age restrictions for movies that have a lot of sexual scenes or a lot of gory/violent scenes. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen movies with ton of gore/violence being PG-13. Any movie that has strong sexual/violent imagery should be PG-15. Teens over 15 can handle gore/violence/sex in movies/TV imo.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To what? You can&#39;t silence people. You can&#39;t control everyone. And especially knowing what I know about Hollywood and the Entertainment Industry. I have been paying attention. It still won&#39;t matter and it still won&#39;t bring change. So, instead of focusing on what THEY are doing, how about we start focusing on what WE are doing? If you see a trailer for a movie that you think there is an agenda being pushed, simply don&#39;t watch it. Imo, the only thing we can do is try and help others develop and use their critical thinking. But you can&#39;t force people to either watch or not watch something, because you think there is something with it. The average person needs to realize that WE have the power. They make is seem like THEY are in power, but that&#39;s the biggest deception. If we stop giving them our money, attention and time, then there is no market for THEM. They exist because we feed their existence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the reasoning of a 12 year old because I don&#39;t exaggerate things? Yes, and? Is anyone forcing you to watch it? It&#39;s a TV show about a zombie apocalypse. You think there wouldn&#39;t be shootings, killings, blood e.t.c? I mean, come oooooon. If you think watching a TV show/movie with lots of gore and violence is going to turn you violent, then simply don&#39;t watch said movies/TV shows and don&#39;t allow your kids to, either. It&#39;s as simple as that. Attacking others and their intelligence or reasoning for not agreeing with you is not going to help further your point, it&#39;s only going to make people not take you seriously. </p>

And only NOW that I&#39;m an adult I can understand them. They have, in no way, shaped my personality, desires or any of the sort.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand the &quot;crusade against sex&quot; statement you made somewhere in the comments here. There&#39;s so much promiscuity in the media, i.e music, entertainment, that even someone like me, with quite a sexual appetite is getting tired of seeing it.</p>

<p>The NoFap movement would seem to be abstinence for the sake of getting out of the &quot;porn spiral.&quot; This will be anecdotal but ever since I gave it a rest (haven&#39;t quit entirely) I now have a much healtier appetite for women, and I actually seek it outside my home. I haven&#39;t felt this way in a good while.</p>

<p>It looks like people, predominantly young males I would reckon, just want to cut old habits and see where it takes them, motivated by the &quot;success stories&quot; of other people. I don&#39;t demonize the porn industry although there&#39;a alot of ugly to that one, but I see the mental health benefits from abstaining.</p>

<p>(Incoming anecdote again) Continuous porn watching helped keep me depressed tbf. Whether it was because watching two other people having a moment that I yearned myself, or how mechanical/artificial and void of real passion it was, I dont know.</p>

<p>The shit becomes too clinical in the long run and there&#39;s no interaction or active use of imagination, just strangling the trouser snake it in front of some moving imagery. I think that starts to do something to a mind (then there&#39;s the desensitization alone.)</p>

<p>When was the last time something that was only subtly sexual gave you the thrills OP? Some fully clothed random actor on the screen. Some bikini-clad woman on some front cover. Some erotic remark or story. Because I sure missed that and I&#39;ve kind of found it again. (Not trying to be smug and you could have no problem at all on that department for all I know.)</p>

<p>Funny how a few days of just abstaning in general might suddenly give you more willpower and energy.</p>
