It is also insanely safe, as it requires plutonium in small amounts to make it generate heat, so unlike Uranium, a meltdown is insanely rare. </p>

<p>However, we see almost no investment into this technology, and we continue to go to war for oil and coal. It seems like Thorium technology is being surpressed by oil or coal lobbies, and is seen by anti-nuclear energy advocates as dangerous.</p>

<p>Yes there is. Thorium does not have a fissile isotope, you need other materials to get it started. Which brings up the supply chain issue.</p>

<p>You can use U235 or spallation via a linear accelerator.   Remember the MSRE went critical on U233 which was bred from thorium.   You are making a non-issue into an issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then you get the thorium and what do you do with it? How do you get it to power your reactor? Ahhh see you didn&#39;t think of that one did you. Well Thorium has to be converted into U233, first you have to irradiate the thorium with neutron radiation. Then when your thorium accepts a neutron it becomes Thorium 233, which then undergoes beta decay into protactinium 233, which will remain protactinium 233 for ~27 days, after which, if it has not absorbed any more neutrons will decay into uranium 233, and then can you introduce it as a nuclear fuel. Except it&#39;s more radioactive and more difficult to handle that reactor grade uranium. Now you know.</p>

<p>So some things here aren&#39;t right.  In a LFTR the worst that can possibly occur is the reactor contents wind up in a passively cooled drain tank, fission stops, and the contents solidify until the reactor is repaired.  That is the worst event that can occur, they are 100% passively save.   </p>

<p>Thorium is fertile, not fissile meaning to start the reactor up you need some fissile material, U233, U235 or Pu239 all would suffice, but U233 would be ideal.  Thorium is transmuted into U233 which is what actually powers a LFTR. </p>
