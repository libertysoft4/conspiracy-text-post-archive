    <div class="md"><p>The Natives were doomed from the moment Cortez landed in Central America- no 2A or lack therof would prevent that. The disease ravaged them first, but what ended them was the true clash of civilizations. Industrial Capitalism is fundamentally at odds with the Native way of life- of living off the land, taking only what you need, of viewing man as an extension of nature. Industrial Capitalism saw nature as an exploitable resource and Man as master of the world.</p>

<p>The 2A had far more practical, philosophical, and theoretical purposes than the mere continuation of the native genocide. That was going to happen no matter what. </p>
