They got to me&quot; and died right on the floor in his friends house. </p>

<p>But....</p>

<p>I do not think its possible to even know the truth, so I have no interest in dying for anything.  If you think knowing the truth is possible, youre going to have a bad time and end up very frustrated.</p>

<p>Live for yourself.  Fill your day with things that give you a dopamine hit without getting hooked on drugs...or get hooked on drugs, it wont matter in a million years anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I love your advice, just want to point out that the term “drugs” should be changed in our vernacular simply because not all drugs are created equal. </p>

<p>Meth, Heroin, crack are deadly drugs that have nearly zero positive effects on your spiritual development.</p>

<p>However, drugs like ecstasy, psylocibin, marijuana can actually help you develop your spiritual being into understanding yourself and God better. These drugs can obviously be abused as well but when taken correctly, they can have extremely positive effects on your overall attitude and perspective on life 😁</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% yes. God is real. If you have any questions just PM me :)</p>

<p>Religion is a tool for social control and making money.</p>

<p>What you think is right &amp; wrong for you is between you and your relationship with God.</p>

<p>Its all about a relationship with God. Like i said a couple days ago, God is fine with you smoking weed or doing some spiritual drugs... as long as you do NOT abuse them... just like food. You abuse food; you get fat and obese. You do too much MDMA, then yeah, your body suffer... Moderation is key!</p>

<p>PM me if you have any questions about a &quot;relationship&quot; with God.</p>

<p>Its something that isnt really taught and the world wants you to think youre just some random act of evolution in the vastness of space so that the idea of a loving God who gave us the gift of life creating us is absurd.</p>

<p>I used to be a vocal &quot;atheist&quot; when i first started using Reddit in 2011... but after learning truths about the illusions of our reality and personal experiences.. I cannot deny that humans have souls and there is a spiritual war going on to keep people in the dark.</p>

<p>Sorry getting back to you so late :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know.. God is perfectly ok with that. There is so much deception in our world that it’s hard to fathom what God truly is. </p>

<p>The way I see it, and Jews believe this too I think but I came to this conclusion before I even know that. </p>

<p>Basically every choice you make is made out of either love or hate. If you choose love more often, then your soul will have a more positive polarity as you go through life.</p>

<p>This basically the message behind Jesus. “Accept Jesus as your savior” and you are able to get into “heaven” </p>

<p>That is true, but what people fail to teach is if you don’t grow your soul in a positive direction, then you’re gonna end up where you started before “accepting Jesus”</p>

<p>At the end of the day we are all human and the rules of the game prohibit God from directly jumping out to non believers and proving he is real. </p>

<p>On my spiritual journey, I have noticed that God does have a way of talking to us subliminally through numbers. I fell in love with the number 47 during my high school football days and I didn’t know why but it over the years I’ve used 47 as a guide in decisions and to be honest, my life has never been better.</p>

<p>Since your agnostic, maybe just try praying to God and give it a real shot to connect with the spiritual realm. You don’t have to go to church every Sunday or confess to a priest, just open your soul up to LOVE and God will let you know he’s there.</p>

<p>Google “Pascal’s Wager” you truly have nothing to lose :)</p>

If you climb your way painstakingly up then when you get there you can stay longer and experience it more fully. Ultimately we all must come and go and who knows how many trips we take, and just because one of your trips went one way doesn&#39;t mean another&#39;s will go the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey! I know this thread is kind of old, but here’s something I read that really resonated with me and just from reading your posts here it makes me think you might appreciate it too.</p>

<p>I think it was the Buddha who said something like, “you can use the boat to cross the river, but once you cross it you should leave the boat behind.”</p>

<p>What I get from this in terms of drug use for spiritual growth: MDMA, acid, Psilocybin, and DMT (ESPECIALLY dmt :) are very useful tools for facilitating spiritual growth. Indeed they really helped me find a sort of “God” type experience that totally rearranged my perspective on what that concept even means. However, once you get that message, continuing that journey WITHOUT the use of drugs can be even more fulfilling, and ultimately mind-blowing. Yoga, meditation, and things like that have catapulted my peace and understanding in a different, but sometimes even more profound way than my experiences with all sorts of psychedelics.</p>

<p>In case you scour my post history, I should note that while my psychadelic experiences were profoundly positive, I’ve also had trouble with alcohol, cocaine, and finally heroin during some of the darkest periods of my life. I’ve had a lot of struggles with depression and other mental health type issues for most of my life, and unfortunately that (among other things) led me to a pretty self destructive place for many years. Currently 112 days clean of ALL substances (not advocating that for everyone, it’s just something that I need,) and trying to continue to grow along spiritual lines to aid in my recovery.</p>

<p>...that was a lot, but thanks for reading, I really connected with your posts here and I just had to chime in :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good advice, also the major issues with Herion, Cocaine and even Booze is they have physical addiction issues, not just addiction to the high, but they physically change the way your body processes things so that if you stop, your body fails.</p>

<p>With booze this is why you get the shakes, booze supplements your body with a self made &quot;drug&quot; that eases out your movements, your body gets lazy and stops making it and let&#39;s the booze do the work.</p>

<p>When you stop drinking for a day or two your hands get Shakey, because your body still isn&#39;t making it and is waiting for the booze to show up and do it&#39;s job.</p>

<p>When your body completely stops making this (a hardcore alcoholic for years) and booze doesn&#39;t show up for 3 or 4 days straight...... You die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel largely the same way. Marijuana has opened my mind to the fact that there are different ways to experience the world and your brain is very complicated/diverse. I took Ectasy for the first time at a festival last year and it was amazing to experience just pure happiness and love. As a usually socially anxious person it allowed me to be myself and talk to people easier and I&#39;ve been able to learn from that. I will be doing LSD for the time very soon and I&#39;m really excited. Hopefully I will gain a new perspective on life and overcome many of the things that hold me back. I know how I want to be and how want to view the world and I think LSD will just make it click and everything will fall into place 😊</p>

<p>What is really going to help you is understanding that God is ok with these spiritual experiences as long as you don’t ABUSE them!</p>

<p>I understand if you don’t believe, but just give it a shot! What you think is right and wrong is between you and God. If you follow your moral compass and choose LOVE always.. God will bless you 🙏🏼</p>

<p>Reddit made me a firm atheist when I first joined it in 2011 but after personal experiences and growing my spiritual self, I won’t ever deny there’s a God again.</p>

<p>But you do you, whatever works. Our relationship with fellow humans is more important. Thanks for your feedback anyway. Any form of discourse that doesn&#39;t descend into ad hominem attacks is always good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha of course everything is just a theory :) only cuz you mentioned the science thing I just have to say... God &amp; science can coexist. God could have created our world with the laws of physics and mathetmatics.. For example, the Golden Ratio could be a divine pattern for aesthetic beauty in nature. </p>

<p>I just like to remind people that we are so much more than fleshy bags of meat.. your soul is eternal and your human experience is a learning process for your soul because being human is one of the biggest lessons your higher self can learn from.</p>

<p>That part of your brain telling you to &quot;think rationally&quot; because I sound crazy is normal.. it is definitely something you need to experience for yourself... just be open to it :)</p>

<p>And Reddit made me a firm atheist when I first joined it in 2011 but after personal experiences and growing my spiritual self, I won’t ever deny there’s a God again.</p>

<p>We’re indoctrinated to believe we’re just a random chance of luck and we’re just monkeys on a floating space rock because they want you to think you’re too smart to believe in God.</p>

<p>The mainstream media peddles the idea that we’re too smart to believe in God anymore... so if the MSM is pushing a narrative, that should be your first clue it is total bullshit</p>

<p>what the fuck? I was raised christian, the majority of everyone I know within religious confines are raised christian, indoctrination comes from an early age, i was indoctrinated to believe in god, as i got older, i realized the idea of a single creator and a permanent hell made absolutely no sense, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind what so ever now that there is not a hell, and most likely not a single creator because of that. If there is a single creator, he has nothing to do with the stories of a christian god in the bible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but it is different for everyone.  Opiates are my favorite, because of the way they make you think/feel.</p>

<p>I often had out of body experiences at night when i would lay my head down after using opiates throughout the day.  Sleep paralysis would kick in, and suddenly i would be able to sit up, and leave my body on the bed, and i can tell you right now...the &#39;&#39;shadowrealm&#39;&#39; (thats what i call it) is a mirrored version of reality, except things decompose, are broken, switched around, upside-down, populated with strange demon like creatures--none of which ever interacted with me negatively though.</p>

<p>I think certain drugs are terrible for you--opiates being one of them, unless you are clever, and take in moderation, and keep from being dependent.  I was able to do so for about 6 years when i started using opiates, and controlled it and my desire to do them, but still, in the end, i took too much, too frequently, and became addicted--which getting away from sucks, unless you&#39;ve got weed, and other stuff to help you out.</p>

<p>I think each drug basically mostly offers something that is worthwhile, except for stimulants--i dislike stimulants very much...to me opiates have the most organic feeling--as in you can still almost be sober when you take them, even when taking quite a bit, but they alter your thinking, and make everything feel good.  Weed would be a close second, nearly tied though...</p>

I’ve been clean from Black from a little over 5 months after doing it for the last 4-5 years and I’ve definitely had a spiritual awakening/recovery since getting clean from opiates... I live in Vegas so the opiate problem is really bad out here cuz the cartels run shit and have the best black lol</p>

<p>Opiates are great for pain management but they’re so easy to get addicted to because it feels just like weed on steroids so it doesn’t seem bad until you start getting the sickness of withdrawals</p>

That’s to say Barack Obama is one of the CIA agents whose job it was to impersonate Osama Bin Laden. I first encountered the theory in the High Level Insider threads and have since came across corroborating material in other sources - ranging from biblical scholars, to the prime minister of Pakistan. 
All of the information I’ve reviewed that’s led to me to the conclusion it might be plausible, is within the public domain- not hard to find at all. But if you don’t mind waiting, I’ll put something together and submit it as it’s own post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Siege in hindsight looks like predictive programming. Eerily similar to the 9/11 official story from how they got into the country, to their relationship with the CIA, to the draconian measures taken. In the movie they implement martial law. You get the feeling they wanted to post 9/11 but couldn&#39;t pull it off. Recommend everybody watch that movie to see how uncanny some of this stuff is.</p>

<p>Movies like that helped set the stage for the wars in the Middle East. How do you get people on board bombing countries that are thousands of miles away and pose no real threat to Americans? You need propaganda. This type of programming planted the seed that people hated us for our freedom and that the War on Terror was necessary and so were wide sweeping actions that trampled civil liberties.</p>

<p>I think the way this stuff works is that it forces your mind to consider something so that when that something really happens your mind believes it to be likely and logical because it has already faced the possibility before.  As opposed to something foreign that doesn&#39;t make any sense that you lack an understanding of.</p>

<p>You have to ask yourself if that is what is happening with Russia on TV and News for the last 5 years or so. The majority of antagonist in TV shows and movies for the last several years has been Russia. Its something I always roll my eyes when I keep seeing. I definitely believe it to be true. This is how intelligence agencies and media likely work together.</p>

<p>&quot;Reality&quot; is your brain mapping sensed data onto your personal cognitive framework. The more points that map, the more real it seems. When few points map, it seems fake.</p>

<p>Where does that cognitive framework come from? Core survival instincts, wrapped in layer upon layer of social conditioning. Nature + Nurture.</p>

<p>Where does the social conditioning come from?</p>

<p>School, (which disseminates) stories (reinforced by) media (and kept in check by) peers. Trusted authorities. That&#39;s the root of all &#39;predictive programming&#39;.</p>

<p>To put it simply, whenever you ignore gut feeling, you delegate your response to the program instead. Understanding the programming is a fine way to spend your time :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually highly probable.  If you think of what makes up matter, which is like 99.9% empty space (just like observable universe) and how matter basically is just electromagnetic fields that interact with eachother, where everything uniformly spins and travels at a similar speed, and your brain is made up of that matter...then you can take away that what we see is a construct of our imaginations.  In other words, dont think of it as your eye is a lens, that looks out into space, and differentiates depth, color, etc. because they are outside, in the environment...because your eyes actually absorb information, and that information is relayed to your brain, and what you think you &#39;&#39;see&#39;&#39; outside of your body, as the environment, is actually being seen in your minds eye, by a culmination of your senses being sent to receptors in your brain, and electrical activity stimulating certain parts of the prain that produce certain sights, sounds, feelings, etc.</p>

<p>Indeed. Truman touches Sirius between two pillars, and so begins his path of initiation. He left a house numbered &#39;36&#39;, and pretended to like his neighbours, with a scripted greeting. More than meets the eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome To Parkland! (The Whole Hogg) - Extensive Cache of Videos From February 14, 2018 Event</p>

<p>Massive collection of news clips reveals that all is not what it seems as portrayed by the US mainstream media (Deep State) when it comes to what really took place in Parkland Florida on February 14, 2018. This video provides extensive evidence that student actors were featured on numerous mainstream media channels and immediately rolled-out by the mainstream media in the wake of the school shooting which raises many important questions, particularly in relation to who acted as the director and liaison between the student actors and the mainstream media outlets. Video footage also provides verifiable proof that the March For Our Lives anti-gun rallies were not a grassroots movement as reported by the mainstream media, and instead were astroturfed by Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Democratic Party acting in collaboration with the mainstream media.</p>

<p>So the film provides no clear answer to your question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see the philosophical implications of the film&#39;s premise but not the connections to him being a conspiracy theorist so much. So yes it is literal I guess. If you want then it is a conspiracy against him, but for a benevolence the perpetrators have for his life, not for his suffering. It was living theater with one audience member unaware. Which in a subreddit of conspiracy theorists is impossible unless this is the only place in the world where everyone..is..right. Oh my god.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with OP but at the same time i really think that in order to be able to really find the truth a reality check needs to be done every certain time.</p>

<p>Like you need to debate with yourself why it may be truth and why it may be not truth, and truly believe it by exploring forums from the opposition groups ideas.</p>

<p>important also to get your ego in complete control because it is very easy to fall into defending something not because you believe is true but because you want to &quot;win&quot; an argument.</p>

<p>Anyone can use its symbolism to justify their comparative journey.</p>

<p>That’s the beauty of a film like that... project yourself onto it and it “speaks” to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is “Plato’s Cave” symbolism in both films...</p>

<p>Matrix uses the same “stuck inside” symbolism but to a different effect. He is immediately exposed to the “lie” by outside forces and teams up with them to defeat an enemy, having the knowledge and power to cross into and out of both “worlds”. This is more similar to classic hero’s journey material, getting taken into a new world, make friends/allies and then together defeating the bad guys.</p>

<p>But Truman Show is distinct in that he’s all alone and the enemy is unclear... as is our experience when we have to journey away from our ideological prisons. Truman is alone trying to escape something he’s not even sure what... that lack of clarify is exactly how untangling yourself from ideological shackles feels like. As the audience we just get to watch him framed within dramatic irony (we know more than him).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think the themes are the same and I think he films use the symbolism for different functions.</p>

<p>Maybe you mean “premise”, the elements that set-up the character in a certain circumstance? Those are more similar. But themes relate to the forces of antagonism... </p>

<p>In Truman Show the true force of antagonism is abstract as it’s literally everyone and everything in his prison, the prison itself, which is actually a metaphor for our mind. It’s is symbolic of an ever present ideology in his mind (the big brain/skull like dome he lives in). And they made it clear that isolated in our minds, we/he has no allies, not even his “best friend”, wants him to escape, as ideologies don’t want us to abandon them .</p>

<p>In Matrix the force of antagonism is clear, Man vs Machine. Using the prison symbolism has only to due with “how” the machines have historically beat humanity... but it’s not the theme. The theme is about man reasserting himself over machine in the never ending man vs machine conflict. A dystopian warning about how the conflict could go in our future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the same study either way, and you&#39;re correct that it&#39;s impossible to find.

    <div class="md"><p>So you don&#39;t think there&#39;s any proof? You can do experiments in your backyard to prove the shape of the earth. There&#39;s photos of the earth from space. There&#39;s astronauts in space right now. The moon is upside down depending on which hemisphere you&#39;re standing in. You can literally watch the sun drop below the horizon. There&#39;s a huge amount of evidence. When someone can present proof to dispute any of that, that&#39;s when people that matter will start discussing the flat Earth. As of now it&#39;s dismissed easily.  </p>

<p>And it wasn&#39;t just <em>any</em> light. It was called &#39;Sirius&#39;, which is the star of <strong>initiation</strong> in certain well-known occult circles such as Freemasonry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is very much social media.  Just like any news organization, Facebook, or similar places for &quot;information&quot; exchange; unless you consider opposing voices as valid (despite the rhetoric of the group), you are in an echo chamber.  All the topics you pointed to were pretty specific to the subgroups you adhere to.  Hopefully you go further than this... but it doesn&#39;t show.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh...the subject of the conversation is the possibility that either the world we live in is fake as in the Truman show, or the metaphorical comparison that we live in a world where evil or ill-intentioned forces control our lives.  Am I supposed to go to Two-X or r/funny for examples?  How can I avoid an echo chamber, where an echo chamber, as you put it, is the only place to have true discourse on the subject?<br/>
If this is social media, I see where you&#39;re coming from, it&#39;s definitely NOT like Facebook in most meaningful ways.   If you mean I have a box that I type in and hit send for the world to see, then sure I guess it&#39;s exactly the same.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my experience, this is not an echo chamber.  You have pro trumps, anti trumps.  Flat Earthers, Holomatrix believers, people who think that UFO&#39;s are angels/demons, people who think that UFO&#39;s are extra terrestrial beings, people who think that UFO&#39;s are intradimensional, or come from the Hollow Earth.  This couldn&#39;t be any less of an echo chamber.  9/11 was in an inside job, no this other guy thinks 9/11 was the Saudis.  Everyone has their own theories and a lot of times, they directly contradict each other.  </p>

<p>And every time I comment, someone like you comes along and engages in healthy debate.  Which is good.  But it&#39;s not an echo chamber.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Most of all, I think the use of the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is applied too loosely, encompassing both mentally ill, looney nuts and serious investigators. Your insistence on using the term, especially on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, which has a definition for &quot;conspiracy&quot;, &quot;theory&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; in the sidebar, puts your intentions into an unfavorable light. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>News flash: there is a theory that links all those items you pointed out. It&#39;s called the human condition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. The Truman Show is a metaphor for the human condition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it states that people are greedy SOB that want to feel important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You must have a lot of friends if you approach people with that premise. Does it give you a feeling of superiority, knowing people for what they truly are, looking through their greedy schemes? Ah, it seems you were talking about yourself. In my world, people are naturally and instinctively inclined towards empathy, sympathy and mutuality. That&#39;s why humans are at the top of the food chain. Only in an environment of scarcity do greed and SOBbyness become a viable survival strategy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy theorists are no different since their whole rhetoric is created to make them feel like they are worth something. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Denialists embody a Truman who shrugs his shoulders every time despite all the clues that should nudge him into a deeper investigation of the world he&#39;s living in, coincidence theorizing all the blatant oddities away, content with his ignorance and slavery. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moment that I hear a theory that states, this effects a large majority of people but NOT YOU OR ME I will start to consider it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you want a theory in which you are a minority. You want a theory that makes you feel special. </p>

<p>As I suspected, your accusations against the rest of humanity are mere projections. </p>

<p>Gotcha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trick is too dissolve his famous proposition &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot;</p>

<p>There is a limit to thinking. It&#39;s a tool as any other action that you may undertake, no matter how subtle and abstract. Thinking helps us navigate, plan, reflect upon this reality, and its product is experience. But it&#39;s still not the full picture.</p>

<p>Try getting to the point where you can say: &quot;I don&#39;t think, yet I still am.&quot; </p>

<p>This is the realm of mystical experiences that so much of our modern culture likes to dismiss as psychosis, schizophrenia, woo-woo, etc. It&#39;s because most have never had any experience even closely resembling this, nor do they care to seek it out.</p>

<p>Mediation and religion will get you there slowly, if at all. Near-death experiences will get you there very quickly, but it&#39;s quite dangerous.</p>

<p>I believe that the best chance to get a glimpse for the Western thinking mind is through safe use of psychedelics. If you explore this culture, combined with the more esoteric teachings of religion (read as allegory, not as literal historical accounts), art, meditation, spirituality, you&#39;ll find your search for absolute truth accelerated.</p>

<p>Mystical experiences, synchronicities, deja vu all serve as reminders that true reality isn&#39;t just limited to consensus reality. Everything that happened to Truman is just a simplified, more digestible version of what can happen to you if you keep looking.</p>

<p>How big are the chances there&#39;s conspiracies out there that literally everyone is in on but you?

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yes, in the movie everyone is &#39;in&#39; on it but Truman.  It&#39;s a metaphor for how the people around you will &#39;play their part&#39; in society to keep pushing the status quo whether or not it is good for you to follow them.</p>

<p>There is another very interesting part of the movie that hasn&#39;t been mentioned yet: during the film we get to see &#39;regular&#39; people and their reactions to Truman as they watch the show. These are not actors, but rather the consumers of all media, even beyond the Truman show. They represent you and me. </p>

<p>The final scene of the movie is Truman crossing the dangerous unknown and reaching the edge of his own constructed reality, making another descion to leave his manufactured coccon world to expirence something closer to the truth. Millions of eyes are on him, we are the reactions of the regular masses in cuts as he leaves.</p>

<p>The final scene is two security guards who watched The Truman Show during their working hours. Even after these characters have seen Truman escape his cage and enter their world- something less manufactured- their reaction isn&#39;t to question what is constructed or manufactured for them by third parties in their lives, but instead to &quot;check what else is on TV&quot;. This is the same reaction most will have to seeing the film, or to seeing a &#39;reality cracking event&#39;.</p>

<p>The Truman show is an allegory for the pseudoenviroments and advertising/proganda holes we are all entrenched in and how there may be some ability to escape through understanding. </p>

<p>The only conspiracy I&#39;ve seen so far is that there are smart people that are &quot;shining a light&quot; on the curruption... if they want to be honest they would tell you the truth: these people rule the world... and the only way you can take it back is to actively better yourself so you can challenge your athority from within the system.</p>

Everything can easily be explained by faulty memory, people misspeaking infront of a national reporter, police being (sigh) police, and citizens reacting appropriately to a horrific event that they were directly affected by.</p>

<p>If you want an actual conspiracy (a lie that is constantly altering the way we see the world to benefit a select few) look no further than our economy.  The nation&#39;s wealth is held primarily by 1%.  This wealth is no longer based the gold standard so it is only dependent on what <strong>we</strong> decide.  Yet this decision is only resered (again) by a select few.  But this is accepted even though it in our ability to change though the barter system.  But no one talks about this because it&#39;s not a story that makes you special.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about this movie for years. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve realized it&#39;s about a man who went along with the determined path, a predestined path that a person walks if they remain from journeying too far from it.  </p>

<p>Truman realized he was a victim of determinism and the only way out was through being a force of determinism himself, through practicing his will.  </p>

<p>I like to think The Cable Guy is Truman who grew up in a neglectful family in an alternate universe, but he inevitably didn&#39;t have the strength to escape his determined path and died for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Booooo. </p>

<p>Follow evidence, not your gut. The Truman Show is a piece of fiction about the ultimate conspiracy-- a contrived hyperbole, not a narrative we should aspire to when applying skepticism to the systems which govern us. </p>

<p>Rather, we should examine &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; of the past which have become well-supported common knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds punchy, but it&#39;s not really true. There&#39;s a lot that we can do to discriminate between fact and fiction. </p>

<p>Grant-funded studies which have methodological quality and have been peer reviewed/repeated are <em>clearly far more likely</em> to have credible results than other studies. Studies paid for by corporations with vested interest in the results. Studies making exclamatory claims with poor documentation, low sample size, non-peer reviewed and no repetitions. You can read them and decide for yourself from first principles. </p>

<p>The same goes for the news. You&#39;re right, at the core reporting is always just relaying observations and we decide whether or not to trust that they aren&#39;t lying/embellishing.  Some people clearly have an incentive to lie and inflame if you follow the money and the connections. Others make a living based on their journalistic integrity, they have a reading demographic who are generally educated and critical, and getting caught in a lie diminishes their integrity with quantifiable monetary consequences. We have a great wide internet with which to get multiple perspectives from large and small organizations, and when facts are repeated by, say, Washington Post, Democracy Now, CBS &amp; TYT, and then fact-checked by politifact and snopes, you can have a lot more confidence in their truth than if it were, say, something that fox and friends read on a blog that the president saw and tweeted. </p>

<p>If you want, you can make up theories in which the entire internet is conspiring to make lies appear as if they are verified by diverse sources. It doesn&#39;t really fit Occam&#39;s Razor and it isn&#39;t really worth making decisions based on imo. You may as well theorize about solipsism (decarte&#39;s demon, or the Matrix). These all COULD be true, but if they were, they would be fundamentally outside of the reality we experience every day, and thus not terribly useful for <em>acting within</em> our reality. When considering any theory, one must ask if it helps us to make predictions, then measure the accuracy of those predictions. This is how relevant truth is found. </p>

<p>Oh, but it is.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Only if you hold those <strong>authorities</strong> accountable. Are they? Have you ever personally checked a claim and followed it to its source, using first principles?</p>

<p>I have, many many times. Always left disappointed, no exceptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#39;t really fit Occam&#39;s Razor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you think this idiom applies to the version of reality to which you personally subscribe, the one I&#39;m suggesting by implication may be based on shaky ground?</p>

<p>I&#39;m genuinely curious if you&#39;ve ever thought it through. At what point each time did you stop and decide &quot;well, I&#39;m convinced&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they would be fundamentally outside of the reality we experience every day</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is my point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When considering any theory, one must ask if it helps us to make predictions, then measure the accuracy of those predictions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Theories are models. Models do not equate to reality, if such a concept can even exist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is how relevant truth is found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The caveat &#39;relevant&#39; is not enough to mask the original meaning of finding truth.</p>

<p>Models do not reveal truth. What they do, instead, is fill gaps to satiate the desire to ask further questions. Consider the implications of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One is never truly convinced and there is always doubt. Inference begins where deduction ends. I&#39;m not arguing that an objective and provable truth is ever discoverable, just that some authorities are better bets than others and that the distinction can be made through reason better than intuition. This is what &quot;evidence&quot; <em>means</em> outside of the context of direct observation, so in this sense we agree. </p>

<p>The points you&#39;re making are all fine in theory, but this is life and we must act. To act we must make decisions. To make decisions which benefit us we must create systems which make better predictions, and that means discriminating facts which are <em>consistent</em> between as many of our observations as possible. It is the distillation of &quot;consistency&quot; which account for the logic and the methods of rationality. &quot;Truths&quot; are the subset of available models which maximizes the consistency of our observations. &quot;Knowledge&quot; is the set of facts which have no unexplainable inconsistencies. </p>

<p>From an epistemologically purist point of view, you&#39;re right, life is subjective. We will never know if the world vanishes when we turn our head. In that all knowledge originates from that which we experience, truth, in some sense, comes from the gut. <em>However</em>, in that the <em>consistency</em> between gut-derived observable facts is judged in the mind using first principles of logic, it is rationality, and not intuition which creates better models of prediction.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is nicely written, thanks for taking the time.</p>

<p>It’s all true within certain prescribed confines of daily life, except you don’t touch upon the <em>validity</em> of the underlying processes.</p>

<p>If one delegates the work of thinking about the world to others, there had better be good checks and balances in place.</p>

<p>What leads you to assume such checks and balances a) exist and b) actually serve your personal interests better than simply rejecting certain assumptions?</p>

<p>Assumptions such as</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when facts are repeated by, say, Washington Post, Democracy Now, CBS &amp; TYT, and then fact-checked by politifact and snopes, you can have a lot more confidence in their truth than if it were, say, something that fox and friends read on a blog that the president saw and tweeted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The suggestion that certain media outlets are more trustworthy than others is revealing.</p>

<p>If you still believe in false dichotomies like “Fox News is untrustworthy, because its opponents are legion, and they can’t all be wrong” then you have a long way to go. They are <em>all</em> leading you astray.</p>

<p>All mainstream media are liars and frauds whose role is to propagate agenda-pushing narratives, agendas which all roll up to the same masters, agendas that benefit from division.</p>

<p>The weakness in this mindset boils down to a core assumption: that when one is confident about one’s cognitive toolbox, when it navigates daily life “well enough”, then it’s fine to delegate hard questions to trusted authority instead.</p>

<p>Is your trust in each authority valid? How honestly have you examined it? At what point did you stop? I’m interested in the source of the confidence. From where does it derive, and what led you to consider certain sources as more trustworthy or accurate than others?</p>

<p>School? History? The media? Your peers?</p>

<p>If your answer reduces down to “someone else double checks facts for me, and other people check the checkers” then I’m afraid this assumption is false. The checks and balances you think exist are all circular and nobody is checking anything beyond a certain superficial and self-referential level, and especially not in the media.</p>

<p>You should reconsider if a framework based on trust in authority is actually serving you, rather than those who abuse it to exploit you.</p>

I don&#39;t remember where I heard it, but I like the idea of it. Like for example, the Truman show is a movie about living in a false reality. So is the matrix. So according to this idea, these movies are produced so the reality manipulators can <em>say</em> that they&#39;re being up front. A loophole of sorts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point. We&#39;re not defining what a conspiracy theorists is, but the legitimateness of a belief behind false inspiration and the thought process that turns an awry circumstance into valid suspicion. Truman Show is a good movie but don&#39;t go saying &quot;See he was right even though none this didn&#39;t really happened.&quot; Reasoning like this is what I&#39;m comparing to the media too. And also you used the phrase &quot;first of all&quot; on your 2nd point which is semantics, but it let&#39;s me know you&#39;re not really listening to yourself so why would you listen to me.</p>

<p>And it wasn&#39;t just <em>any</em> light. It was called &#39;Sirius&#39;, which is the star of <strong>initiation</strong> in certain well-known occult circles such as Freemasonry.</p>

<p>When Truman goes to touch the light, the camera angle is odd: we see Truman from ground level. This angle is used because it means that we see Truman touch the light in between <strong>two pillars</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is a metaphor?</p>

<p>What you consider &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; may have had very similar experiences. Not literally a stage lighting rig fall down in front of them with only sky above them – maybe it was three skyscrapers. </p>

<p>Maybe they saw whistleblowers tell them their life is a lie before being disappeared. </p>

<p>Maybe they noticed that politicians are &quot;crossing their fingers&quot; all the frigging time. </p>

<p>Maybe they noticed that the main stream media activities were on an annual loop. </p>

<p>Maybe their attempts to break away from their lives constantly didn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>They would have to be fictionally obtuse characters if they didn&#39;t investigate these clues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, the biggest key difference:</p>

<p>Literally everyone but Truman was in on it. Of course his friends and family told him to stop and he had to push against them - they were in on it. They were part of the conspiracy, literally every single human Truman has ever met up until that point conspired against him.</p>

<p>How big are the chances there&#39;s conspiracies out there that literally everyone is in on but you? If your friends, parents, partners IRL tell you you&#39;re a paranoid fucker and you see that as confirmation that you&#39;re on the right track in your conspiracy theory, I&#39;ve got news for you: They&#39;re most likely right, you <em>are</em> a paranoid fucker.</p>
