<p>Spacetime is quantized - made of tiny spherical black holes of the planck length diameter and planck mass energy density. These black holes make up spacetime like molecules that make up water. </p>

<p>Since they are the planck mass energy density and curve space to singularity - many of them in a row can act as a spacetime bridge, a wormhole - giving rise to a wormhole structure of space in which quantum entanglement arises as an intrinsic feature. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER%3DEPR">ER=EPR (entanglement is due to physical wormholes)</a>.   </p>

<p>In plain english : <strong>The entirety of space and time is entangled</strong></p>

<h1>On &#39;numerology&#39; claims</h1>

<p>There is no numerology or fuckery going on when you take the quantum vacuum energy density derived by mainstream quantum field theory equations (the supposed energy of empty space), and envision how much energy is in the proton volume - you yield the mass of the observable Universe.</p>

<p>This is taking an absolutely enormous number (10<sup>93</sup> grams / cm<sup>3)</sup> and an extremely tiny volume (proton volume 2.831 * 10<sup>-45</sup> m<sup>3)</sup> and just so happening to end up with the mass of the Universe (10<sup>55</sup> grams).</p>

<p>There is no numerology or fuckery going on that once you realize this would make the proton a black hole (due to mass in a volume) you can apply the holographic principle.</p>

<p>Now we&#39;re dealing with even larger equations (how many planck energies fit on the proton surface divided by how many planck energies fit in the volume) - and absolutely nail the protons actual rest mass.</p>

<p>To give you an idea - that is</p>

<p>~47000000000000000000000000000000000000000 fit on the surface.</p>

<p>~1200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 fit in the volume.</p>

<p>We are taking these enormous numbers, dividing them and multiplying by the planck mass.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Surface Plancks on proton area with proton charge radius  : 4.71 * 10<sup>40</sup></p>

<p>Surface Plancks times planck mass: 1.02656 * 10<sup>36</sup> gram</p>

<p>Divided by planck energies in volume</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+*+%284.7116551*10%5E40+*+planck+mass%29+%2F+1.2804*10%5E60">2 * (1.02656 * 10<sup>36</sup> gram / 1.2804 * 10<sup>60)</sup> = 1.603498 * 10 <sup>-24</sup> grams</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>0.0000000000000000000000016 grams.</p>

<p>Skeptics explanation for deducing the very near the exact proton rest mass: Chance.</p>

<p>Regardless of what critics propose, there is no alternative explanation for the mass of the Universe being equivalent to the amount of vacuum fluctuations that fit in the proton volume, and the rest mass via the holographic principle. It&#39;s not because of any known physical constant, any physics trick, etc. It&#39;s simply what it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the greatest minds in physics have known that the Universe is not a purely mechanistic, materialist, reductionist phenomena. </p>

<p>These titans wrote the books. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.”</p>

<p>&quot;Quantum physics thus reveals the basic oneness of the Universe&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The total number of minds in the Universe is one&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>― Erwin Schrödinger</p>

<p>Nobel prize 1933, enormously advanced quantum physics</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about the atoms this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. . . . We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Spirit. This Spirit is the matrix of all matter.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Max Planck</p>

<p>Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Birthed Quantum Mechanics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Werner Heisenberg</p>

<p>Nobel prize 1932, enormously advanced quantum physics</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It from Bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom — at a very deep bottom, in most instances — an immaterial source and explanation; that what we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions and the registering of equipment-evoked responses; in short, that all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- John Archibald Wheeler</p>

<p>Coined &quot;black hole&quot; to objects with gravitational collapse already predicted early in the 20th century, and coined the terms &quot;quantum foam&quot;, &quot;neutron moderator&quot;, &quot;wormhole&quot; and &quot;it from bit&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Metaphysical has been science’s designation for all weightless phenomena such as thought. But science has made no experimental finding of any phenomena that can be described as a solid, or as continuous, or as a straight surface plane, or as a straight line, or as infinite anything. We are now synergetically forced to conclude that all phenomena are metaphysical; wherefore, as many have long suspected — like it or not — life is but a dream.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Buckminster Fuller</p>

<p>Second World President of Mensa from 1974 to 1983, architect, systems theorist, author, designer, and inventor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Albert Einstein</p>

<p>Nobel Prize in Physics 1921</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Science is incompetent to reason upon the creation of matter itself out of nothing. We have reached the utmost limit of our thinking faculties when we have admitted that because matter cannot be eternal and self-existent it must have been created.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- James Maxwell </p>

<p>One of the most profound physicists of all time. Greatly advanced understanding of electromagnetic fields</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“God is a mathematician of a very high order and He used advanced mathematics in constructing the universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Paul Dirac</p>

<p>Enormously advanced quantum physics and quantum electrodynamics. Shared Nobel Prize with Shrodinger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey D8 I love all the work you put in here and the respect you give to the greatest scientists of our time.  </p>

<p>I feel like a lot of people can&#39;t get around the interconnectedness of elementary particles because they&#39;re still stuck in the EPR mindset where lightspeed limits information transfer.  Quantum physicists really put the nail in that coffin, though, and it is abundantly clear that something is connecting particles and is unimpeded by spacetime.  I love the holographic idea and how a realm without spacetime solves the issue.  </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t looked into it, but I wonder if Haramein has done any work connecting the holographic universe to the wave/particle duality and the observer effect.</p>

And the second alternative (a creator) is even <em>less</em> probable because then you have to suppose even more improbable things - the creator&#39;s creator, the creator&#39;s creator&#39;s creator, the creator&#39;s creator&#39;s creator&#39;s creator&#39;s origins and so on (since simply saying &quot;oh he always existed&quot; is very proofless and as valid as saying &quot;no I did it&quot;). </p>

<p>No, quite the opposite. I&#39;m comparing and showing how that is as valid as the end of the world or god, which is not much. But the are ideas (like as string theory) that are mathematically consistent and truthful which makes them actually valid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry your view is not supported.</p>

<p>Claiming we have no evidence is incorrect. Everything we know in our physical world had a cause to begin. Everything physical but you claim we have no evidence stuff needs a cause. You know which theory has zero evidence? Yours. The universe beginning without cause would be unique, no evidence for that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is evidence actually. You simply &quot;believe&quot; the universe is special from everything we know and totally behaves differently and came into being without a cause. Your view appears to need actual evidence. </p>

<p>Your view relies on a universe that came into being without any cause. If you hold this view you are pretty alone and more importantly without much actual evidence. </p>

<p>Those who support this line of thinking appear to hold this view merely as a form of defense against the implications of the cause</p>

<p>I think it would be more accurately described as a non-zero tachyonic field or it&#39;s interaction. Similiar to the Higgs Field.</p>

<p>The Higgs field might have further intricities with Holofractual theory. It is responsible for giving mass to the Weak force, thus breaking Electroweak symetry. In simple terms in extremely hot temperatures(think at the start of the universe) the weak bosons are identicle to the Photon. A possible theory suggests all the forces, including possibly gravity, were indistinguishable at the very start.</p>

<p>Maybe this would point to a single dimension which than fractured into the respectic parts as temperature cooled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a physist hobbiest so I can&#39;t comment too much on this particular theory.</p>

<p>However I wouldn&#39;t go into infinity scale. A tachyonic field is faster than the speed of light. Possibly infinite fast(and indeed all charged tachyonic particles will reach practically infinte speed due to Cherenkov radiation). The Higgs field, a tachyonic field, does not produce tachyonic particles because quantom fluxtuations induce tachyonic condensation before it reaches negative energy. Hence the Higgs boson is not tachyonic.</p>

<p>If the entanglement is through a tachyonic field without using particles, it might permit information exchange/storage at an infinite(or close to or practically infinite since they are infinjtely close to infinitd without technically reaching infinity.)</p>

<p>This would not actually require bending of spacetime, which I think alligns with Holofractuals information storage inside the vacuum energy.</p>

<p>The way I imagine Holofractual is that the vacuum energy from the proton&#39;s volume space stores the information for the entire universe. The Proton(or other particle) than interacts and shares information through the field interaction.</p>

<p>Thinking about it more however makes me dubious why the Proton would be the boundary for the information storage. Holofractual focuses alot on the Proton, but this would dictate special properties it particulary has. I cannot think of a mechanism to attribute these properties just to the Proton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there&#39;s a few different possibilities. There&#39;s a very real possibility that hawking radiation switches off at a certain scale black hole.</p>

<p>-D. F. Falla, P. W. Landsberg, “A Black-Hole Minimum Mass“, Il Nuovo Cimento 106B:6, 1991.</p>

<p>There is also the latest work in Planck Stars. They find a very similar micro-black hole object of the planck density that Nassim is describing.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about this object is because it&#39;s so gravitationally curved, even if it evaporated in it&#39;s frame instantly, from the outside it would look &#39;frozen&#39; for billions of years!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While it would be expected that such a repulsion would act very quickly to reverse the collapse of a star, it turns out that the relativistic effects of the very extreme gravity such an object generates slows down time for the Planck star to a similarly extreme degree. Seen from outside, the rebound from a Planck star of stellar mass takes longer than the timescale of the universe to date, such that stellar mass black holes seem to be stable to an external observer. Even more elegantly, the emission of Hawking radiation can be calculated to correspond handily to the timescale of the gravity effects on time, such that the event horizon that &#39;forms&#39; a black hole naturally evaporates as the rebound proceeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One idea I&#39;ve been contemplating lately is how the photon factors into everything.</p>

<p>A constant theme in &#39;alternative&#39; texts is the light=love aspect.</p>

<p>If the whole thing is a self-feedback loop constantly evolving itself based on said feedback, and the underlying mechanisms are holographic using the EVM as a framework, we could summise that the information feedback network is holographic as well.</p>

<p>But instead, we have our &quot;projection&quot; -- and I&#39;ve always interpreted reality/multiple dimensions as the various projections of light through the jitterbugging EVM.</p>

<p>But I think it plays a bigger part. The photon is unique as an elementary particle, and I think it is important to the &quot;information&quot; system in terms. Perhaps light represent the &quot;collapsed&quot; holographic state of information (ie. a specific point on the surface of the black hole).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy. So lets do this....again. Im a Layperson. I have no degree in phyics, but let me disect this nonetheless.  </p>

<p>tl;dr: its total BS Science.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spacetime is quantized - made of tiny spherical black holes of the planck length diameter and planck mass energy density. These black holes make up spacetime like molecules that make up water. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Blackhole is when spacetime is so distorted that a singularity forms, a area so massive that nothing can escape. A Blackhole is the Physical Manifestation of Infinity. There is no actual Planck Length or Planck time. They are fictive units so certain calculations make sense. Molecules are made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of Electrons Protons and Neutrons. Protons and neutrons are made up of Up and Down Quarks (2Up for 1 down for the Proton, and 2 down 1 up for the neutron) They are held together by Gluons which as the name implies holds them together. They are Pointparticles. Which means that they do not exist as a 3Dimensional shape. They should be imagined like a pinprick in a canvas. They are not spherical. The Spherical shape is do to orbiting.</p>

<p>Every elementary particle has wavelike properties. That is something very difficult to wrap your head around. This means every particle has a chance to exist in a certain position and or at a certain velocity (uncertainty principle). Spacetime is the consequence of the interaction of masses. </p>

<p>So everything that the OP wrote in that paragraph is wrong. Literally everything. That is quite an achievement i have to say. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since they are the planck mass energy density and curve space to singularity - many of them in a row can act as a spacetime bridge, a wormhole - giving rise to a wormhole structure of space in which quantum entanglement arises as an intrinsic feature. ER=EPR (entanglement is due to physical wormholes).</p>

<p>In plain english : The entirety of space and time is entangled</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, just no. So much words that have absolutely no meaning in the context. Quantum entanglement is something entirely different. If everything would be entangled with everything else then that universe would have very different properties then ours. In Plain english <strong>Its Bullshit</strong>.</p>

<p>(Ignoring the &quot;link spam&quot; and marching  on...)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no numerology or fuckery going on when you take the quantum vacuum energy density derived by mainstream quantum field theory equations (the supposed energy of empty space), and envision how much energy is in the proton volume - you yield the mass of the observable Universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Proton volume is not a fixed volume. The charge radius is based on how far away a proton with a charge of +1 can attract a electron with a charge of -1. This charge radius is not fixed and is only an approximation. It can be bigger and smaller depending on temperature and velocity. Which kind of makes your assumptions invalid.</p>

<p>those are just easily verifiable facts that have been proven by countless experiments. Quantum Gravity is something entirely different, and it doesnt at all reconcile Spirituality or occultism. Its Fan Fiction. </p>

<p>There is nothing even remotely Divine about People for now.</p>

<p>Nope. It&#39;s the point at which our mathematical understanding of the universe ceases to apply. They are both very real things.</p>

<p>Then you explain what a molecule is for two paragraphs to lead to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are not spherical. The spherical shape is do to orbiting and uncertainty. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But his claim in no way depends on this, so I&#39;m not sure why. Also, you meant &quot;due&quot;.</p>

<p>Then you talk about the wavelike properties of matter, because at this point you&#39;re giving a physics 101 lesson. </p>

<p>In a metaphor, you&#39;re saying consciousness can&#39;t exist because you know the different parts of the brain.</p>

<p>Yes, it does. Our current view of physics don&#39;t apply to consciousness, but that IN NO WAY means it isn&#39;t a part of it - we just don&#39;t understand it yet. You could have said the same for the origins of the universe and the microcosm.</p>

<p>I think it does.  You know why?  Because subjectivity can be fully explained in an objective nature...that&#39;s what I think at least.

Just because your actions may be completely determined doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not subjectively experiencing them. In fact, your subjective experience <em>can&#39;t</em> be an illusion; who would it be deceiving? </p>

<p>In fact, the fact that <em>you are conscious</em> is the <strong>only</strong> thing you can know with 100% certainty. Like Descartes said, &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry if I gave the wrong impression - I wasn&#39;t looking for this, just pointing out that a new mechanism for consciousness might answer the soft problems, but not the hard one</p>

I think it requires a philosophy that humans don&#39;t have the computational capacity to understand.

If existence itself had a &quot;starting point&quot;, it&#39;s uncaused. Yet here we are...)</p>

<p>A Blackhole is when spacetime is so distorted that a singularity forms, a area so massive that nothing can escape. A Blackhole is the Physical Manifestation of Infinity. There is no actual Planck Length or Planck time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assumption, assumption, assumption.</p>

<p>First off - we have no idea what the internal structure of a black hole is. It&#39;s actually <em>the place where our physics breaks down</em>. </p>

<p>We&#39;re literally waiting for quantum gravity to reconcile what a black hole structure is.</p>

<p><em>However</em> there has been excellent work done on black holes that are actually singularity free - and guess what? They do this by utilizing planck energy densities.</p>

<p>For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_star#Planck_star">planck stars</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The key feature of this theoretical object is that this repulsion arises from the energy density, not the Planck length, and starts taking effect far earlier than might be expected. This repulsive &#39;force&#39; is strong enough to stop the collapse of the star well before a singularity is formed, and indeed, well before the Planck scale for distance. Since a Planck star is calculated to be considerably larger than the Planck scale for distance, this means there is adequate room for all the information captured in the black hole to be encoded upon the star, thus avoiding information loss.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the exact type of object that Resonance Science puts forth as the proton black hole. It&#39;s even hypothesized to be the same size! Weird.</p>

<p>Further - &#39;nothing can escape&#39; is an assumption. There are solutions that utilize Einstein Rosen bridges to allow for communication outward. You again are groking at the place where our physics fails us and yelling about it. </p>

<p>This is the black hole information paradox, and is another massive missing link in our understanding of physics, and again waiting on quantum gravity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every elementary particle has wavelike properties. That is something very difficult to wrap your head around. This means every particle has a chance to exist in a certain position and or at a certain velocity (uncertainty principle). Spacetime is the consequence of the interaction of masses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, just no. So much words that have absolutely no meaning in the context. Quantum entanglement is something entirely different. If everything would be entangled with everything else then that universe would have very different properties then ours. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can handle in one swoop - deBrogile / Bohm Pilot Wave. Pilot Wave is an alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics that can very succinctly describe all the wavelike and particle dynamics we see in things like the double slit.</p>

<p>Checkout <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodynamic_quantum_analogs">hydrodynamic quantum analogues</a> like performed by Yves Couder. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5iHQMjcsM">MIT&#39;s replication of Yves Couder&#39;s wave-guided particle effect</a> </p>

<p>What&#39;s more - <strong>some interpretations of Pilot Wave require that the Universe is inherently non-locally correlated - and that a single quantum wavefunction describes the entire thing</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/pilot-wave-theory-gains-experimental-support-20160516/">https://www.quantamagazine.org/pilot-wave-theory-gains-experimental-support-20160516/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Bohmian view, nonlocality is even more conspicuous. The trajectory of any one particle depends on what all the other particles described by the same wave function are doing. And, critically, the wave function has no geographic limits; it might, in principle, span the entire universe. Which means that the universe is weirdly interdependent, even across vast stretches of space. The wave function “combines — or binds — distant particles into a single irreducible reality,” as Sheldon Goldstein, a mathematician and physicist at Rutgers University, has written.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes. If spacetime is made up of a Bose-Einstein condensate of light, a planck density of empty space, it would support a Wheeler Wormhole network / quantum foam interpretation that would in turn support a pilot wave interpretation of QM which would in turn support an inherently non-local cosmos.</p>

<p>You are right, but then again we can never truly know. Since a blackhole is a &quot;blackbox&quot; no information that can describe the internal structure can escape (hawking radiation does not contain useful information about the internal structure) i was given my own opinion on that matter. So you get that point.</p>

<p>an einstein rosen bridge needs to propagate either through space and (or) time. If you use a einstein rosen bridge to &quot;probe&quot; a blackhole you are in effect changing the geometry of the Blackhole making any information gained invalid. The only valid solution is a many body calculation. That is for now not within our technological reach. </p>

<p>Pilot wave theory works only on few body systems. Its a nice way to enter the quantum world for our brains, because it makes sense. But it stops making sense at one point. </p>

<p>I am not saying that the universe isnt connected in a way, but the speed at which that connection and interaction happens is the speed of light in vacuum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually science has taken some leaps on understanding the possible mechanisms of gravity.</p>

<p>Scientists theorize the Weak bosons aquire mass from the Higgs Field. This is why the Higgs Boson was so important. Electroweak symetry breaking put a hole in the standard model. The resolution was a Higgs Field giving the weak bosons mass. Predicting and finding it gives credence to this theory. Think of gravity(for the weak bosons) as the Higgs Field tugging on the bosons which tug on spac3.</p>

<p>Less certain they are on the mechanisms of other gravity causes. The primary mass giver, quark-gluon interaction, is in it&#39;s infantile state. Additionaly the Higgs Field allows other fields to exist at energies we cannot test yet. Think of quark-gluon mass as quarks tugging and slowing each other through gluon interaction.</p>

<p>Look at it this way. Our observable universe is a black hole, the singularity of that black hole is the big bang. We are describing the internal structure, day by day. I&#39;ve known this since an early age, because there is an observable universe. At the edge of the observable universe is a boundary we cannot see beyond. It is a Schwarzschild radius, a cosmic event horizon. Zoom out enough on something and it disappears or takes a new form. Information from our observable universe cannot escape because it is in &quot;a black hole&quot;, information would have to travel beyond the event horizon, which is expanding at the speed of light. You&#39;d have to fast forward the information without fast forwarding anything else so that it catches up to the wavefront of expansion. So far this seems impossible, but holofractal implies new concepts that could make it possible. We won&#39;t know until we explore that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With consciousness you mean Divinity i guess (different names, same fuzzy thing). Aslong as you die, it aint.</p>

<p>The You ceases to exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to think that, but I no longer do. I used to be peacefully atheist/agnostic (Dawkins is a pain in the ass), but I can no longer say that I support that atheist viewpoint. Nor am I saying I switched from atheism to theism. Hear me out.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at this from every angle I could research and imagine. The result is amazement. The more we look into things, the more we reveal the infinite nature of the universe and ourselves. At one point I fell into what they call an abyss, and then I came out on the other side. It was one of the best experiences I&#39;ve had. Some call it enlightenment, others call it Kundalini awakening. Whatever. I know it exists now. We&#39;re on a journey. This is described by the monomyth or hero&#39;s journey. It isn&#39;t defined by it, only described by it. The monomyth is a pattern of the universe that we have discovered. Buddhism has the same concepts. Let go of your ego and ask the universe. The universe is out there, and it is also inside you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you awaken from this illusion, and you understand that black implies white, self implies other, life implies death — or shall I say, death implies life — you can conceive yourself. Not conceive, but feel yourself, not as a stranger in the world, not as someone here on sufferance, on probation, not as something that has arrived here by fluke, but you can begin to feel your own existence as absolutely fundamental. What you are basically, deep, deep down, far, far in, is simply the fabric and structure of existence itself. So, say in Hindu mythology, they say that the world is the drama of God. God is not something in Hindu mythology with a white beard that sits on a throne, that has royal perogatives. God in Indian mythology is the self, Satcitananda. Which means sat, that which is, chit, that which is consciousness; that which is ananda is bliss. In other words, what exists, reality itself is gorgeous, it is the fullness of total joy.</p>

<p>The Earth is not a big rock, infested with living organisms, anymore than your skeleton is bones infested with cells. The Earth is geological, yes, but this geological entity grows people. So the existence of people is symptomatic of the kind of universe we live in.</p>

<p>-Rene Descartes</p>

<p>IMO, the abyss is that realm of thought, not where you get lost and confused and reprimanded by the universe, but it is where you experience the true nature of the universe and then everything starts to make sense. Past, present, future merge into one endless possibility which describes our existence. For example, we are just one planet out of trillions. There is another planet out there that is a mere million years older than ours. A million years isn&#39;t much as far as the universe is concerned, but it is huge as far as evolution and consciousness goes if we compare it to ourselves. There are thousands of these planets, older and younger than ours. On some of those planets there must exist life forms, evolving. Why wouldn&#39;t they? It is not even questionable to me that there might be &quot;aliens&quot; out there in space far more advanced than us, it is a fact provided to us by the universe and our ability to observe it. If you know the universe, then you will know this is a fact, not a fantasy. We are aliens to them. They are aliens to us. But we are all sharing in this same energy that has been set about by the cosmos, this energy that lets us see and touch matter, this radiation from energetic celestial objects that randomly or accidentally programs DNA &quot;code&quot; to eventually create us. But how could this be an accident? DNA aims to survive and evolve for its environment. The species of DNA consume each other in what is called the food chain or circle of life, and through consumption of DNA by other DNA-species, DNA evolves further and incorporates new traits about the environment. Viruses also program DNA. As far as we know this process has no end or final goal. Pretty much anything could happen. Have a look at some deep sea species, they are aliens. Our aliens. The abyss, and DNA, are like the ouroboros:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It [ouroboros] also represents the infinite cycle of nature&#39;s endless creation and destruction, life and death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you die, your friends and family remember you. How is that so? Because our consciousness is a shared energy, it is a crowd sourced affair that you might say exists in a higher dimension for lack of a better term. All of the ancient civilizations, through their religions, tried to comprehend this realm where thought happens and where experiences exist. Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity. They were attempting to explore and understand the unphysical. Heaven, akashic records, the spiritual plane, whatever you want to call it. We could not possibly evolve to the point we are at unless our consciousness was like this. Evolution trends towards higher consciousness. Why is that? Every past species we know of was a step in the right direction, until humans and collective consciousness arose out of this cosmic-DNA feedback loop, and from that, spawned intelligence. We cannot survive space. Machines can. The next step I believe is artificial intelligence. If our consciousness and intelligence can somehow be put into machines, we will evolve further and adapt to new environments besides Earth. We will become even closer to our maker, the maker of the stars, that which breathes life into the universe. This was the plan all along. It is the nature of the universe. It has already happened though, in another time and place, if only you understood the universe.</p>

<p>Einstein still exists in our consciousness and he still shapes the way we look at physics. He is dead, but his concepts live on. His concepts were helped along by all the other conscious humans during his time period. It&#39;s a shared affair. We still have Sherlock Holmes shows on TV, because Arthur Conan Doyle imprinted himself into our collective consciousness through his spirituality and art of writing. You brush your teeth in the morning because other conscious beings discovered it to be a good way to maintain oral health. Everything about us is shared consciousness. When you&#39;re a baby, everyone helps you become conscious. Without that help, you do not become conscious on a human level. There are anomalies such as the wild children who grew up in the woods and lack the shared consciousness we have. Their consciousness lines up with wild animals, as this is the environment they live in. It is only when we conscious humans step into that person&#39;s life and attempt to teach them math and language that they &quot;join&quot; the collective consciousness the rest of us are all part of. So you see that consciousness cannot thrive or evolve without other consciousness helping out, and consciousness itself is an environment &quot;to be in&quot;. You might ask yourself then, what helped out our consciousness?</p>

<p>Apologies for the wall of text, I&#39;m working on better ways to describe this stuff. This isn&#39;t a copy paste so there might be some contradictions here and there, but I think the point has been made. There is so much more about this universe than what we know or think. We&#39;ve barely scratched the surface. It makes me happy to be alive and able to experience it all for a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me preface this by saying that i love wondering about reality.</p>

<p>Suggesting that anyone <em>really</em> knows what&#39;s going on is absurd. They might have some really good ideas, but to suggest that humans can grasp reality through our tiny keyhole of perceptions is arrogance in its purest form. What we perceive as light is less than 0.000002% of the EM spectrum. We can use machines and tools to expand our keyhole, but we will never know what the sun &quot;looks&quot; like because we&#39;re simply incapable of perceiving all the data it&#39;s broadcasting.</p>

<p>An unusual hit of dopamine leaves us catatonic, awash in emotions. 200 years has morphed our language so much that we now differentiate between american and British English. We have no idea what is pushing the universe apart or holding galaxies together so we call it dark matter and dark energy. </p>

<p>There&#39;s <em>so much</em> we don&#39;t know that claiming to know anything for sure is no more than hope and wonder.</p>

Backed by the USAF they were able to improve and replicate the results of the Michelson Morely experiment as well as definitively prove that relativity is a hoax. They also posted a damning sidebar on the state of science and how those in the ivory towers have weaponized science to dumb us down. Try getting an article like this published in Nature magazine today. They warned us but we didn’t listen! Enjoy the read my friend and I’m stoked to be here!</p>

Maybe not all modern ideologies are &quot;there&quot; yet but relativity is definitely real. Reality is a malleable fabric. If you&#39;re really on the &quot;flat earth/firmament&quot; side (which I still believe in, half and half) why don&#39;t you regard the space inside the firmament is literally a third dimensional realm?

<p>Irrelevant since they don&#39;t teach there. Science is external to political influences. Science is not a &quot;guess&quot;, it&#39;s millions of scientists debunking themselves with tests, studies and experiments and observing which conclusions they can draw from the results. If you don&#39;t understand that maybe keep reading the bible and pray for an invisible sky-being :)</p>

All day long we are, in some degree helping each other to one or the other of these destinations. It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all of our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations - these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really hard to explain, but I feel deep down many of us kind of &quot;know&quot; parts of this. Basically just imagine everything exists now, is eternal, and we&#39;re basically the same &#39;mind&#39; (everyone&#39;s consiousness is the same &quot;me&quot;), and we all created or are part of the same reality in a holographic (2D projected but looks and feels 3D) matrix-type thing. We&#39;re just going through one tube/string of life in this period.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a megagigantic mindfuck and I recommend just imagining and thinking about it the next time you&#39;re grabbing a shower, that&#39;s where I started to get a hang of this type of thinking. Imagine that a single water droplet in the shower could contain the same entire cosmos you live in right now, and there&#39;s &quot;you&quot; in that waterdroplet along with all of your friends, and the time it took for it to hit the floor of your shower and mix in with the other water droplets was the age of the entire cosmos, which we have yet to complete, but we also HAVE completed it but our minds are experiencing - for whatever reason - that it&#39;s just a day in March of 2018.</p>

<p>Then imagine you and the entire cosmos is in a water droplet too, and a gigantic you is taking a shower too and watching that waterdroplet we&#39;re all in, and he&#39;s in a waterdroplet too, in an endless loop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect that the big bang never happened.  That what we see as space-time is an illusion brought about by our inability to experience and understand the compact simultaneous nature of the universe.  I suspect that every event in the universe occurs simultaneously, but which we can only experience linearly temporally and in 3 dimensions. I suspect what we call time, for example 1 second of time, is just us experiencing two sequential instantaneous states of reality (parallel universes, maybe?) that are slightly different.  Between these two states of reality are an infinite number of states slightly different from the last, which is perceived as time passing in 3-D space, with one state of space-time eventually becoming the other state of space-time, one second apart.  If there is no big bang, and time is an illusion, there will also not be the heat death of the universe.  What we predict to be the heat death of the universe is simply the furthest point in the timeless cosmic egg we find ourselves in that we can observe.<br/>
Only consciousnesses which can only observe the universe in 3 dimensions can experience time and space. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don’t “prove” theoretical physics. You gather experimental evidence that supports it, and you try to falsify your own claims, both of which Nassim does. He has modified and refined his theories continuously just like the established branches.</p>

<p>I’ve read the critiques. None convince me. Modern physics is as much of a joke as Nassim, judged by their own standards. Pretty much all of modern physics relies on foundational paradigms that are either taken for granted or also cannot be proven or tested. General Relativity is a total sham.</p>

The thing that it&#39;s a hologram of.
The gadget that makes the hologram from something else.
And the conscious observer who sees the hologram as a projection of whatever it&#39;s a hologram of.</p>

<p>The universe is everything -- including all four of the foregoing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually science has taken some leaps on understanding the possible mechanisms of gravity.</p>

<p>Scientists theorize the Weak bosons aquire mass from the Higgs Field. This is why the Higgs Boson was so important. Electroweak symetry breaking put a hole in the standard model. The resolution was a Higgs Field giving the weak bosons mass. Predicting and finding it gives credence to this theory. Think of gravity(for the weak bosons) as the Higgs Field tugging on the bosons which tug on spac3.</p>

<p>Less certain they are on the mechanisms of other gravity causes. The primary mass giver, quark-gluon interaction, is in it&#39;s infantile state. Additionaly the Higgs Field allows other fields to exist at energies we cannot test yet. Think of quark-gluon mass as quarks tugging and slowing each other through gluon interaction.</p>

<p>We are no longer clueless about mass and gravity, however much more needs to be understood.</p>

<p>That is evidence actually. You simply &quot;believe&quot; the universe is special from everything we know and totally behaves differently and came into being without a cause. Your view appears to need actual evidence. </p>

The reason everything doesn&#39;t get sucked up is because most things (at least those measurable) are stable. The blackholes that make up the &#39;fabric of spacetime&#39; are in stable relationships with one another. </p>
