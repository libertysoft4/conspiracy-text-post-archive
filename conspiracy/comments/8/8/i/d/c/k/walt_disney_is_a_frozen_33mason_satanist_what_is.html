    <div class="md"><p>I think this way:</p>

<p>From what we know about trauma, it yields the type of responses in the “victim” (viewer), that make a person an ideal consumer and plebeian. </p>

<ul>
<li>feels unsure of himself, insecure about the world around him, anxiety (unconsciously more likely to trust a parental type entity)</li>
<li>creates addictive behaviors (trauma is the shovel that digs the hole in our soul that we try to fill with food, sex,drugs and anything else that gives us a positive initial feeling) </li>
<li>learns (too soon?) the raw deal- your parents will DIE. This steals the mental slow realization - robbing the child of the natural existential moment that would be healthy for the forming mind, and instead shoving a copy, a fraudulent idea in there. </li>
<li>trauma is the driver inside of family dysfunction. All are traumatized but to varying degrees. It causes emotional outbursts, distrust, anger, depression, it’s general emotional confusion- all these feelings, all not good, and you aren’t even sure where from. </li>
</ul>

<p>Line from a book: </p>

<p><em>”Television trauma won’t kill you because you watch Snow White or Batman or Bambi or Nemo or Full House or Jumanji, but it will eat away at the human spirit and corrupt the soundness of the individual mind. The ubiquitous trauma that oozes from every pore and pixel on the screen is  hikacking the Hivemind- a death by a thousand paper-cuts. “</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of it isn’t that secret and takes little analysis beyond being open to it and not being so naive that you think, “They wouldn’t try to sneak controlling concepts in a little innocent tv show.” Why WOULDNT they? It’s a natural medium for control. Literally everything on tv has been run through the sieve, a checking system that DOES have some merit, albeit minor. They do have to check that no accidental/purposeful control techniques are used that would hurt people. They’d use that though (“words are powerful and we have to make sure no accidental negative subliminals) to be in there and put in whatever they want under the guise of... whatever they want. If people started watching TV with a discerning eye ... they’d be SHOCKED AND APPALLED AT WHAT THEY SEE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the Mainstream explanation, thanks for bringing that here, I will put it on the description next time I ask a version of this question here later today, Im looking for the occult reason, for example the mainstream reason for the Disney films to have hidden sex references is animator shenanigans, but the real occult reason is subliminal programing to create fetishes and the sort, I was just wondering about the occult motives for the missing mothers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see, in which case I&#39;d say he might have been attracted to fairy tales because of the female tropes in them. A good book about women in these stories is From the Beast to the Blonde by Marina Warner, it also covers the &#39;monstrous feminine&#39; such as witches, evil stepmothers etc. I don&#39;t know much about Disney&#39;s personal life despite being a big fan of animation, I will have to look into it and see if I find anything.</p>
