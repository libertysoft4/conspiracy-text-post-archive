    <div class="md"><p>Only a few days ago, the Skripals chances of survival were a bleak 1 out of 99.</p>

<p>Remarkably, they are now expected to recover in what is indeed an Easter miracle!</p>

<p>Students of the occult should absolutely note the timing of this, as in my opinion staging this &quot;resurrection&quot; a few days before Easter has all the hallmarks of an occult ritual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the Moon of Alabama</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It seems less and less likely that the British government claim about &#39;Novichok&#39; poisoning is actually true. Way more likely are other explanations, for example food poisoning or an allergic shock soon after eating out at a fish restaurant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yulia and Sergej Skripal were found unconscious on the afternoon of March 4.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s possible that if the entire hoax was orchestrated by British intelligence, that the Skripals were given something at the restaurant that simply put them to sleep. And that after they were &quot;found&quot; outside on the bench and hospitalized, the propaganda machine went into overdrive.</p>

<p>If Skripil was indeed planning to return to Russia, this episode could have been orchestrated by  England  in order to change his mind. Because it would have been embarrassing. And to launch an anti-Russia campaign the likes of which the world has never seen before. And which only fools believe. Because there is no evidence. Only bullshit on top of more bullshit.  <a href="http://yournewswire.com/poisoned-russian-spy-mi6-trump-dossier/">&quot;According to reports, shortly before his poisoning, Skirpal was negotiating his return to Russia by offering Russian officials proof that the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) had created the Trump Dossier in cooperation with the Obama-Clinton regime.&quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You took up where another redditor left off, and you  proceeded to call me names and to  judge me, and you had no fucking right to do that. And you never will. You have failed to understand or appreciate my anger that became necessary  as a result  of  a  redditor that would not leave me the fuck  alone, and refused to accept the fact that I have a right to share articles from whatever site I want to, without  repeatedly being harassed while  being told what I may or may  not do. Furthermore, you mentioned that the site  I shared a truthful article from might get clicks from people as a result of my sharing it. I could give a fuck if that&#39;s the case. Get that in your head. I could give a fuck if that&#39;s the case. You&#39;re on a high horse pal, and the name of your  horse is Fucking Hypocrisy. You&#39;re worried about a site getting $.10 or $. 25 cents, and yet you publicly declared recently that your financial support will continue  for the site that Sibel Edmonds is best know for, and associated with, even though Corbett has publicly announced his split from her and his desire to never again have anything to do with her or Newsbud. Some people have integrity, like James Corbett, and some people do not.  And that sentence leads to  you, on your horse, up high. 
Edmonds has been lying about and attacking for months with no end in sight, 2 women that are very important in this world, 2 women that I respect very much, 2 women whose lives have become an important part of the truthful story in Syria and other parts of the world. Newsbud is going to continue to receive your money, amazingly, the very site from which Edmonds is leading  her attacks and videos from,  which are directed at the 2 beautiful and hapless women, and you want to judge me because I shared an article from a site that may get $.10 or  $.25 cents worth of clicks. You&#39;re going to continue  supporting a website from which an insane off the rails  lying piece of shit  bitch is directing an inquisitional witch hunt from, and you think you have the right to judge me because I shared a fucking article. Holy what the fuck! I think not. I think you have no right to judge me. In fact, I think  you have no right to judge anyone. And I think that you need to get the fuck off Hypocrisy, because the horse deserves a better mount. I also think that it might be a good idea to stay the fuck away from me in the future,  because I fucking hate hypocrites and people that fuck with me, and even more than that, I fucking hate  Sibel Edmonds and  or anybody that is willing to give that bitch or Newsbud  a fucking dime.

<p>Difference being Newsbud still has other great writers who I watch. Edmonds is simply one of them. I&#39;m not on any &quot;high horse.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re still being a completely hysterical and insecure person. I didn&#39;t judge you, I just asked calmly if you could simply link another source, because, in your words, the information was available in many other places. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also think that it might be a good idea to stay the fuck away from me in the future</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t have to tell me twice, considering your unhinged diatribe for my very calm and simple post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I fucking hate Sibel Edmonds and or anybody that is willing to give that bitch or Newsbud a fucking dime. The end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sibel has done good work in the past, though she has gone off the rails. Besides, when I joined I paid the anual fee. Not like I&#39;m paying monthly. Just gonna let it run out and not renew.</p>

<p>Good chat! I would recommend Kava for your anger and emotional issues. Take care.</p>

<p>If you really want to post links for fake news websites, then I recommend using <a href="http://archive.is/">archive.is</a>. Archive the page, and then post a link to the archived page. </p>

<p>It would look like <a href="http://archive.is/FW5uj">this</a>. Note the lack of clickbait! </p>

<p>That way people can&#39;t bash you for linking to fake news sites, and you won&#39;t be driving traffic to their unethical operators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of kids grow up being taught not to care what the other kids think about them, and that works just fine in grade school. Grade school kids are psychotic little pricks, and stupid to boot, so caring what they say is moronic. </p>

<p>Middle school is the same or worse, but by the end of high school, no matter what your mother told you, it&#39;s a good goddamn idea to start paying attention to what other people think about you. </p>

<p>Be realistic. You&#39;re going to have to get a job, rent an apartment, or be accepted to a post secondary institution (and you probably wouldn&#39;t mind having a girlfriend) so you really need to start paying attention to how others perceive you. Submitting yourself to the judgement of others sucks ass, but it&#39;s part of life, and you need to learn to accept criticism. </p>

<p>People who enter adulthood still believing that it&#39;s ok not to give a fuck about what other people think are socially handicapped. Sure, there are a few rebels out there who make a go of it regardless, but they have talent, or money, or other unusual things that let them skate by. The rest end up struggling through life, railing against the system because no one will hire them just because they wear concert T-shirts to job interviews and have a few neck tattoos . </p>

<p>What other people think about you really is important. Posting links to yournewswire.com makes me, and every other <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> denizen who&#39;s paying attention, think you&#39;re gullible and tragically lacking in critical thinking skills. I called you out on it not to make you feel stupid, but to help you get your voice heard. </p>

<p>The last time I got called out for linking to a crap site, I took it to heart, and now am much more careful about the links I post. You can do whatever you like, of course, but unapologetically posting links to shitty, fake news, clickbait websites in this sub just makes you look dumb. If you feel you have something important to say, then you shouldn&#39;t handicap yourself in this way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I&#39;m feeling harassed by another redditor I just click &quot;block user&quot;. It&#39;s in the grey coloured tab below each comment reply. I think it&#39;s better just to block a user, instead getting angrier and angrier as they continue to reply to your rude demands that they stop. Right before you block someone though, you have to remember to fire off one last parting insult to which they then can&#39;t respond. You might find it extremely satisfying!</p>

<p>At the highest level you have to believe two contradictory facts to believe the story:
(1) Russia has a powerful and evil spy network than can kill anyone, anywhere, at any time without a trace of the assailants. 
(2) Russia has a borderline retarded spy network that goes after irrelevant ex-spies that haven&#39;t had access to Russian data in 15 years, that releases spies from Russian jail only to track them down and kill them later, that kills using a poison that in any way could be linked back to Russia, that kills using a highly complicated and messy method using nerve agents instead of something subtle and untraceable like a car accident, a heart attack, or even a bullet to the head, and that <strong>doesn&#39;t even kill the intended targets of the mission!!</strong></p>
