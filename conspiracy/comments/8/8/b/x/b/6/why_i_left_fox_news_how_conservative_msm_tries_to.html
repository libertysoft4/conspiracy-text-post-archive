<blockquote>
<p>You could measure the decline of Fox News by the drop in the quality of guests waiting in the green room. A year and a half ago, you might have heard George Will discussing policy with a senator while a former Cabinet member listened in. Today, you would meet a Republican commissar with a steakhouse waistline and an eager young woman wearing too little fabric and too much makeup, immersed in memorizing her talking points.</p>

<p>This wasn’t a case of the rats leaving a sinking ship. The best sailors were driven overboard by the rodents.</p>

<p>As I wrote in an internal Fox memo, leaked and widely disseminated, I declined to renew my contract as Fox News’s strategic analyst because of the network’s propagandizing for the Trump administration. Today’s Fox prime-time lineup preaches paranoia, attacking processes and institutions vital to our republic and challenging the rule of law.</p>

<p>Four decades ago, as a U.S. Army second lieutenant, I took an oath to “support and defend the Constitution.” In moral and ethical terms, that oath never expires. As Fox’s assault on our constitutional order intensified, spearheaded by its after-dinner demagogues, I had no choice but to leave.</p>

<p>My error was waiting so long to walk away. The chance to speak to millions of Americans is seductive, and, with the infinite human capacity for self-delusion, I rationalized that I could make a difference by remaining at Fox and speaking honestly.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>As early as the fall of 2016, and especially as doubts mounted about the new Trump administration’s national security vulnerabilities, I increasingly was blocked from speaking on the issues about which I could offer real expertise: Russian affairs and our intelligence community. I did not hide my views at Fox and, as word spread that I would not unswervingly support President Trump and, worse, that I believed an investigation into Russian interference was essential to our national security, I was excluded from segments that touched on Vladimir Putin’s possible influence on an American president, his campaign or his administration.</p>

<p>I was the one person on the Fox payroll who, trained in Russian studies and the Russian language, had been face to face with Russian intelligence officers in the Kremlin and in far-flung provinces. I have traveled widely in and written extensively about the region. Yet I could only rarely and briefly comment on the paramount security question of our time: whether Putin and his security services ensnared the man who would become our president. Trump’s behavior patterns and evident weaknesses (financial entanglements, lack of self-control and sense of sexual entitlement) would have made him an ideal blackmail target — and the Russian security apparatus plays a long game.</p>

<p>As indictments piled up, though, I could not even discuss the mechanics of how the Russians work on either Fox News or Fox Business. (Asked by a Washington Post editor for a comment, Fox’s public relations department sent this statement: “There is no truth to the notion that Ralph Peters was ‘blocked’ from appearing on the network to talk about the major headlines, including discussing Russia, North Korea and even gun control recently. In fact, he appeared across both networks multiple times in just the past three weeks.”)</p>

<p>All Americans, whatever their politics, should want to know, with certainty, whether a hostile power has our president and those close to him in thrall. This isn’t about party but about our security at the most profound level. Every so often, I could work in a comment on the air, but even the best-disposed hosts were wary of transgressing the party line.</p>

<p>Fox never tried to put words in my mouth, nor was I told explicitly that I was taboo on Trump-Putin matters. I simply was no longer called on for topics central to my expertise. I was relegated to Groundhog Day analysis of North Korea and the Middle East, or to Russia-related news that didn’t touch the administration. Listening to political hacks with no knowledge of things Russian tell the vast Fox audience that the special counsel’s investigation was a “witch hunt,” while I could not respond, became too much to bear. There is indeed a witch hunt, and it’s led by Fox against Robert Mueller.</p>

<p>The cascade of revelations about the Russia-related crimes of Trump associates was dismissed, adamantly, as “fake news” by prime-time hosts who themselves generate fake news blithely.</p>

<p>Then there was Fox’s assault on our intelligence community — in which I had served, from the dirty-boots tactical level to strategic work in the Pentagon (with forays that stretched from Russia through Pakistan to Burma and Bolivia and elsewhere). Opportunities to explain how the system actually works, how stringent the safeguards are and that intelligence personnel are responsible public servants — sometimes heroes — dried up after an on-air confrontation shortly before Trump’s inauguration with a popular (and populist) host, Lou Dobbs.</p>

<p>Dobbs has no experience with the intelligence system. Yet he ranted about its reputed assaults on our privacy and other alleged misdeeds (if you want to know who spies on you, it’s the FGA — Facebook, Google and Amazon — not the NSA). When I insisted that the men and women who work in our intelligence agencies are patriots who keep us safe, the host reddened and demanded, “Patriotism is the last refuge of the — you fill in the blank.” As I sought to explain that, no, the NSA isn’t listening to our pillow talk, Dobbs kept repeating, “Patriotism is the last refuge of the — fill in the blank.”</p>

<p>Because I’d had a long, positive history with Dobbs, I refrained from replying: “Patriotism is the last refuge of the talk-show host.”</p>

<p>I became a disgruntled employee, limited to topics on which I agreed with the Trump administration, such as loosened targeting restrictions on terrorists and a tough line with North Korea. Over the past few months, it reached the point where I hated walking into the Fox studio. Friends and family encouraged me to leave, convinced that I embarrassed myself by remaining with the network (to be fair, I’m perfectly capable of embarrassing myself without assistance from Fox).</p>

<p>During my 10 years at Fox News and Fox Business, I did my best to be a forthright voice. I angered left and right. I criticized President Barack Obama fiercely (one infelicity resulted in a two-week suspension), but I also argued for sensible gun-control measures and environmental protections. I made mistakes, but they were honest mistakes. I took the opportunity to speak to millions of Americans seriously and — still that earnest young second lieutenant to some degree — could not imagine lying to them.</p>

<p>With my Soviet-studies background, the cult of Trump unnerves me. For our society’s health, no one, not even a president, can be above criticism — or the law.</p>

<p>I must stress that there are many honorable and talented professionals at the Fox channels, superb reporters, some gutsy hosts, and adept technicians and staff. But Trump idolaters and the merrily hypocritical prime-time hosts are destroying the network — no matter how profitable it may remain.</p>

<p>The day my memo leaked, a journalist asked me how I felt. Usually quick with a reply, I struggled, amid a cyclone of emotions, to think of the right words. After perhaps 30 seconds of silence, I said, “Free.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fox News is still better than MSNBC or CNN by far if you&#39;re a real progressive anyway (Fox News is indeed terrible... I&#39;m not arguing that... but it&#39;s better). I noticed this during the primaries where CNN &amp; MSNBC did jack shit for Bernie and completely shilled for Clinton. I also noticed a lot of &quot;Russia&quot; in your post, even though there isn&#39;t proof of Russian collusion. All we have proof of is a few Russians doing a bad job at trying to spread ideas. Luckily for Americans, we&#39;re free to think whatever we want. If we hear a good idea from a Russian we can choose to like it. If we hear a bad idea from a Russian we&#39;re free to say &quot;wtf no way&quot;.</p>

<p>The problem in our country isn&#39;t &quot;scary ideas&quot; or more specifically &quot;scary Russian ideas&quot; it&#39;s a lack of options. Why were Clinton &amp; Trump our only two options? Because TPBP supports FPTP instead of score or approval voting (RCV is <em>much</em> worse than these 2 and only slightly better than FPTP). In 2016 we saw the <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/08/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-he-consistently-beats-donald-t/">most democratically supported candidate</a> get cheated off the ballot by a rigged primary, and we also saw <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/796222841612042240?lang=en">Clinton &amp; the DNC elevate &amp; legitimize Trump</a>.</p>

<p>All of this limiting is artificial. It can be changed. Once the American people realize this it&#39;s GG.</p>

<h1>This is all fraud.</h1>

<p>I&#39;m totally down with the idea that Democrats can pick &amp; choose their candidates by going &quot;<a href="https://medium.com/theyoungturks/dnc-we-can-legally-choose-candidate-over-cigars-in-back-room-e3026730e252">into back rooms like they used to and smoke cigars and pick the candidate that way</a>&quot;. If they want to do that more power to them! They should be able to do that!</p>

<p>But wait...  how does that make sense you might be asking. Well...</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be the first to admit that they did NOT do this the right way. If they wanted to pick a candidate they could/should have done that but <em>if</em> they do that then it has to be transparent. In 2015 &amp; 2016 Democrats collected money under false pretenses. We thought we were donating to a candidate who had a fair shot. Some of us even donated to the DNC directly. Collecting that money under false pretenses is fraud.</p>

<p>Finally something on your list that actually might be considered fraud or at least manipulative.

<p>Saying Bernie supporters are only white liberals isn&#39;t fraud. There is no universe where saying something like that is fraud. It doesn&#39;t hurt Bernie nor show bias. He may be incorrect but that isn&#39;t fraud.</p>

<p>You are attempting to cherry pick random quotes and say that bias. Fine there was bias from individuals even high up individuals. You have to show some behavior from the organization that shows they tried to favor Clinton. Which is why the Donna Brazile debate question is the first example you use that actually may have helped Clinton over Bernie.</p>

<p>Nothing else shows actual action. Even the email saying the story should be spread; was it spread? Did the DNC spread it? I don&#39;t recall seeing it.</p>

<p>Thanks for agreeing that there was bias (and actions) against Bernie. The DNC rules are that they must remain neutral. They told donors they were neutral. That is wrongful deception.</p>

<p>All I have to do is show that they weren&#39;t neutral. Actions to hurt Bernie&#39;s campaign are not, especially when the same is not done to Clinton&#39;s campaign for actions they did. Plus, Bernie was her only opponent so also by definition any actions taken against Bernie would be helping Clinton.</p>

<p>Lying isn&#39;t stealing a vote it is lying. Redoing an election after it was done would be highly irregular; the rules of the primary were set before it started. You can&#39;t claim fraud for following the rules.</p>

<p>They punished Bernie for a guy the DNC recommended yet won&#39;t punish Clinton for deceiving voters, which is a direct threat to our democracy? That&#39;s not neutral.</p>

<p>The ORGANIZATION said they were neutral. They weren&#39;t. It&#39;s wrongful deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>we boil down both ideologies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If liberal and conservative are both ideologies, where does reality fall? </p>

<p>Are science and religion both ideologies?</p>

<p>On the issue of big versus small government, what are we really being told?</p>

<p>Conservatives say they prefer small government and they say so based upon an ideology that would eliminate all government except police and military. Liberals simply do not have an ideological view of government. They believe that the size of government is due to the substance of its role and not some arbitrary number. To liberals, government may need to be larger or smaller depending on its function. For example, a liberal would tell a communist that government is too big because it does not give them the freedom of earning more money for their work or living in an area they like, etc., AND a liberal would tell a conservative that government is too small because it does not provide for universal retirement, safety and fraud regulations, or healthcare. Conservatives are always ideological, liberals are not always ideological. Conservatives lack nuance and situation appropriate views, liberals are all about nuance and situations.</p>

<p>If we look at economic policy of Republicans, who play the role of conservatives, we see an agenda that is designed entirely for the purpose of maintaining an oligarchy or expanding it -- both on paper and with historical examples. If you currently believe that the conservative economic agenda of Republicans is a good thing, we can look at both the theory of &quot;supply side,&quot; and the demonstrated history of deregulation and tax cuts. </p>

<p>We will find that Republican economic policy is &quot;disposed to preserve existing conditions&quot; like making sure that the top one percent absorb some 15 percent of the income, and they want to &quot;restore traditional&quot; economic theory so that America is more like it was before the Great Depression -- or worse yet, like the late 1800&#39;s when three oligarchs had more control over American than any three people ever did before or since.</p>

<p>I apologize if you got that from what I said. I will expand...</p>

<p>I am not assuming that all change is good or right. The word means that a person if favorable to &quot;progress,&quot; meaning that they want change that is improvement upon current conditions.</p>

<p>These days, we see lots of people who want change, but the change they want is change <em>back</em> -- for example tax cuts and deregulation or &quot;traditional values.&quot; These kinds of changes are not liberal, but quite the opposite -- they are in a subcategory of conservatism that is <em>reactionary</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and conditions that existed in the past are always wrong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. (1) We know what we know and (2) we can do what we do at any time based upon overall circumstances. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>For example, we previously knew that DDT would kill mosquitoes and prevent disease. That was progress. As we continued to look, we found that DDT is harmful to humans and found other methods of controlling mosquito born disease. Were we wrong? Not based upon what we knew.</p></li>
<li><p>While there were many bad aspects of Obamacare, one part of it that was progress was its ability to increase health coverage to tens of millions of people who were not previously insured. (Unfortunately, based upon political conditions at the time, we could not get universal coverage nor &#39;free&#39; coverage for all, and it had that awful mandate attached -- so Obamacare was a mix of conservative and liberal change).</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s honesty can be disarming.</p>

<p>Like when he admitted he was greedy. He was at some rally and he said that he&#39;d led a shallow life of conspicuous consumption. &quot;I&#39;ve always been greedy,&quot; he said, with candor. Then he added (with slick political unctuousness): &quot;But now I want to be greedy for America. I want to be greedy for <em>you!</em>&quot;</p>

<p>While I doubt the second part of the statement, I do appreciate that he was man enough to concede the first part.</p>

<p>Like when he was at an evangelical event and said openly, &quot;I don&#39;t deserve to be on the stage with the rest of you. I&#39;m a horrible human being.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump gets away with so many human failings (that would kill any other politician) because he never pretends to be Holier-Than-Thou. It insulates him vulnerabilities that Christian-Conservatives have. </p>

<p>Ted Cruz cheating on his wife hurt him with his base. Trump sleeping with porn stars and strippers ten years ago? People yawn.</p>

<p>(&quot;Of course he did!&quot;)</p>

A woman noticed how bitter,angry and confrontational her otherwise normal father had become after years of fox news and right wing radio. She was surprised during the making of the documentary of how many people wrote to her with the exact same problem. Right wing media turning their parents into these super argumentative people and amping up how scared they were of Muslim people. Even at the end they got her father off all the right wing media and he slowly started turning back into the father she had known for years. It was pretty eye opening stuff </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll have to check that out. My parents (former hippies who protested Vietnam War back in the day and generally laid back people) watch Fox all the time, and it has really hurt our relationship. They are immune to logic. Some days, there are glimpses of hope, like my dad will say he thinks Trump is crazy or the Republican party doesn&#39;t care about him. Then, he will spend 2 days watching nothing but Fox and the irrationality will come back. The biggest issue we have now is that they don&#39;t understand that I can criticize the Republican party and telling me the Democrats did the same thing doesn&#39;t refute the Republican party doing something wrong (Cambridge Analytica)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking about that yesterday actually, that you can&#39;t find any truly unbiased news. Do I like Trump? No, but I don&#39;t think every single thing he has done is evil. Do I like Hillary Clinton? No, and I think she and her family have done a lot of shady stuff that people don&#39;t even know about. I hate Paul Ryan and I hate Chuck Schumer. It&#39;s very scary the news we are not given as media has become completely politicized and spun </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.  We&#39;re in the same boat.  Nowadays I get my news from all over place.  I listen to a lot of NPR, get a lot of news on twitter, podcasts, etc.  I&#39;ve just gotten a lot better at recognizing what&#39;s political theater/propaganda/noise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you mean the Harvard shorenstein center study.  It&#39;s the study that&#39;s referenced in nearly every article appearing on the first page of a google search for &quot;media bias in 2016 election&quot;.  Has to be one of the strongest gaslights I&#39;ve ever seen.  I remember a pole that came out leading up to the election where 75% of respondents agreed that the media favored Hillary Clinton.  I mean, you have to be pretty disingenuous to convince yourself otherwise.</p>

Mainly bc how horrified he was of him with the Nuke button. Anyway, he voted for Trump and when he came to visit me in January, he was trolling people talking shit about Trump on FB. I mean, he never even went on FB, much less talk shit to women or strangers on there. It is the craziest thing I have ever seen and so sad</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck this guy.</p>

<p>Look I’m no trump support, in fact fuck him too. He’s a disgusting, pompous, braggart but compared to the neoliberal/neocon order that has ruled since the early 90’s he’s nothing. The political status quo of this country continued to sell out the working class and middle class in favor of corporations, Wall Street, the oligarchs, and war. After decades of that, this gave rise to Trump because for a lot of Americans nobody was looking out for them (Bush Sr, Jr., Clinton, and Obama were nothing but yes men for Wall Street) not that trump is any better (look up his connection to Robert Mercer) but his rise is an indictment of the current state of desperation. </p>

<p>Now this guy is only bitching and moaning that the status quo might be in jeopardy. Although he had no problem with Bush and neocon’s bullshit Wars (I can almost guarantee he’s in favor of John Bolton’s appointment)</p>

<p>On a side, who the fuck does this guy thinks he’s fooling saying the NSA isn’t monitoring us. Of course we know Google, Facebook and other tech companies are invading our privacy but they all do it in conjunction with the NSA that was literally what the 2013 leaks were about. Once again fuck this guy, he gets everything he deserves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well someone is pushing for war with Russia.  The latest claim regarding the poisoning along with diplomats being kicked out of various countries is playing to a war with Russia scenario.  There was not solid evidence that Russia was actually behind the poisoning, yet the Western countries seem determined to go after Russia regardless.  No one is trying to calm the waters.  Now as for involvement of the MSM -- they seem to be onside with the claims being made by the UK, EU and other Western entities, and they are making no effort to investigate the claims.  The MSM seems to take direction from the political class.  They are not operating independently. The political class is pushing for war and the MSM is doing nothing to challenge this.  It is a matter of their abdicating responsiblity by simply believing and printing what the politicos tell them to say without challenging the dangerous situation that is unfolding. </p>

<p>After a few years and the rise of Keith Olberman (followed by Rachel Maddow) a lot of folks considered MSNBC to be the left wing equivalent of FOX.</p>

<p>The scary part to me is how now all the sudden CNN, ABC, NBC, WaPo, NYT...basically anybody who isn&#39;t FOX is considered to be liberal propaganda by large chunks of the population. </p>

<p>A lot of times these organizations have people on site at the White House, reporting first hand from war zones and disasters, and people are more inclined to trust some dude blogging from their parents basement because they aren&#39;t a part of the dreaded MSM</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Fox has a particular view of the Russia collusion issue and your points likely would have called that into question.  Speaking out would not have done that much good because the issue still would be mired in speculation and rumor. 
&quot;All Americans, whatever their politics, should want to know, with certainty, whether a hostile power has our president and those close to him in thrall&quot;  Perhaps, but your comments were not going to provide any additional certainty -- just more speculation.  I do not think that any media should be focusing on this until we have concrete information.  So far very little solid information has come out, and those who have been charged have been charged with stuff that has nothing to do with the central issue of Russian collusion.  The whole thing is quite exasperating. </p>

<p>Personally, I have decided that the Russians did not collude with Trump.  The reason is that if the Russians wanted some sort of leverage with the US government, they surely would have chosen to &quot;collude&quot; with a more likely candidate than Trump.  NO ONE even expected him to win.  An additional point is that even if there was interference in the election by some Russians it was too minor to have any sort of impact, and apart from a few social media postings no one has indicated what they might have done that could have had a significant impact.  The answer is nothing. </p>

<p>If you have something useful to say regarding a viable &quot;collusion&quot; scenario -- tell it to Mueller.  He seems willing to listen to all sorts of rumors and speculation.  That seems to be what he is getting paid for. </p>

<p>MSM and liberal media propaganda sources are rightly talked about and discussed here in the sub. Doesn&#39;t mean we should ignore conservative MSM propaganda sources as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s still propaganda. The conspiracy is the propaganda that Fox news is pushing out in order to manipulate others for their agenda. And it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s new info or not, and has never been a criteria for a topic to be discussed here.</p>

<p>Russian collusion was built off nothing in order to be a divisive tactic between conflicting opinions.</p>

<p>Now we live in an environment where no one wants to talk to one another and speak each others thoughts. I have friends both liberal and conservative and both are at each others heads. I am here trying to be a middle man trying to expose both sides are full of crap but neither side wants to listen.</p>

<p>Anyone who believe there is Russian collusion or the divisive tactics played by MSM on BOTH SIDES then you are already being deluded by the system.</p>

<p>I did not like the fact that the comments were so heavily attacked for NOT BEING ONE SIDED! So I stepped out of the whole thing. There isn&#39;t much room in this sub (and too many others) to actually share different ideas.</p>

<p>In one of the comments I deleted, I conceded a point to someone and asked a question. If stuff like that is worth 10 down votes, count me out.</p>
