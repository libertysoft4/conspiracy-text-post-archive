    <div class="md"><p>I’m not attempting to debunk the Vegas conspiracy by any means, but I think the delay relates to the civil lawsuit against the casino/hotel. I would imagine their legal team delayed the release as long as possible Bc once it’s public info, Plaintiffs in the case don’t need discovery for it, and it leads to more discoverable information. </p>

<p>Regardless of what’s on the videos, it confirms my suspicion all along: no reasonable person would have seen this guy making 30 trips Home, coming back with new bags each time(heavy bags), and not been suspicious. It’s just not possible, even the dumbest human on the staff  would have found his behavior abnormal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but there were other events in which the videos were released in a more timely manner.  The entire investigation was suspicious from the very beginning.  I mean, if you stay in a Vegas hotel, then staff will enter your room at least once every 24 hours.  This is policy.  They become really suspicious otherwise.  </p>

<p>I agree.  His behavior is abnormal.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but in those other events you are talking about schools, or other state owned locations, sovereign immunity and other considerations means lawsuits just aren’t as common. </p>

<p>Like I said I’m not debunking the conspiracy because the videos do beg the question: “are these just the most oblivious employees in the world, or is there another explanation that involves a willful ignorance of what was happening?” </p>

<p>One if the most insidious coincidences about 9/11 is that the towers were just purchased by a man who took out an insurance policy for triple the purchase price. He ate breakfast in the towers every day before 9/11 but miraculously wasn’t there the day of. His family and close friends also miraculously avoided the building too. </p>

<p>All I’m saying is the delay is best explained by the lawsuits against the hotel. There were probably NDAs signed by all employees after the fact to prevent leaks, strict oversight of what was given to law enforcement, etc. </p>

<p>I, like you, believe this was packaged by a PR crisis management team at MGM. </p>

<p>LVMPD videos and calls will eventually be released (they said 6 months) and will give us at least a little more information. One would hope. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is the state required to keep track of guns, or the owner? </p>

<p>Yes, the state is supposed to have a record of every gun, who it is sold too and who owns it. </p>

<p>What if he purchased in a different state, is that state now liable? </p>

<p>You can make a case for each state the gun was in because he is supposed to declare firearms when crossing any state line. Movving weapons across state lines is legal if they know you are doing it and if those guns are legal in that state. Various states have various gun laws and what is allowed to be owned. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t truly believe that any organization has the resources to track the activities of every individual.</p>

<p>Actually I do. The NRA is supposed to keep a list as is the ATF and the FBI. </p>

<p>I have a gun that was given to me for Christmas, I do not have to register it, therefore the state cannot track - with the idea that i am not presumed guilty, without first proving so. </p>

<p>This is wholly Wrong. Guns given as gifts have to be registered. And therefore can be tracked. Any gun not registered is now illegals and is a felony In most states depending on nature of firearm. </p>

<p>What would having a record of purchases have stopped? </p>

<p>Absolutely nothing, except if the guns were legal it would put up a red flag to the FBI and other Law agencies of a known ammo dump in the area. </p>

<p>Do you have a specific case that went to trial where a venue was held responsible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like this guy just wants to argue with you. I think it&#39;s very clear to many of us why all of those entities would be sued (and are). The video was obviously packaged and sold by a PR crisis firm hired by MB hoping it&#39;ll do some good to repair their image. </p>

<p>For instance, nowhere in the video (that I saw) do you see an employee handle a bag.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The title of that article is of course misleading. It <em>does not</em> show him &quot;filling his suite with guns&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a compilation of video of a man who frequented that casino for months/years. There are no time stamps on these videos. Those are pieces of luggage that could have <em>anything</em> in them, maybe just clothes. And maybe those clips are taken over the course of several different visits to the casino.</p>

<p>The NY times got exclusive rights to these videos, given to them by MGM. The release of this content makes the whole vegas event even more shady as fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was released (sold) by MGM--- probably packaged by a crisis firm to repair their image (no employee handles bags that I saw). </p>

<p>The LVMPD is required to release the all the video (even boring parts) and 911 calls in full. I am assuming for the length of Paddock&#39;s stay and possibly day after. 911 calls probably the day of. They were required to delete or blur any identifying information (faces, addresses, etc.) from videos and calls. At first they said this would cost them something like 500k. I believe that was thrown out. </p>

<p>At the time the order came down the LVMPD said it would take 6 months to do all this. We (or the news agencies) will get far more at that time. Hope this helps. </p>

<p>Oh, and I don&#39;t think the FBI is involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP here...</p>

<p>I should have shared my thoughts first...</p>

<p>I feel like these are legit.  These video snippets are from private security cameras owned by the various hotel &amp; casinos that he visited leading up to the event.<br/>
A) the hotels aren&#39;t going to release that video prematurely until a &quot;thorough&quot; investigation was completed.  This allowed officials time to review the footage, ask any questions they wanted, and &quot;clear&quot; the hotels of any specific wrong-doings(i.e. lawsuits).
B) Just like any other big event like this, the majority of footage of the event taking place is from witnesses cell phone video.  Those leak like wildfire, as we saw youtube lighting up right after.  Similar to the recent Parkland shooting, the only video we saw was some kids Snapchat that got out before it could be locked down for any evidence.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, this video only shows what we basically knew, logically.  &quot;There had to be video of him lugging all these guns and ammo in suitcases up to his room&quot;...Boom, there it is.  </p>

<p>The thing we may never know is what led him to this point.  We don&#39;t see any mysterious meetings in these videos.  We don&#39;t see anything really to dispute the fact that this guy carried this thing out on his own.  As much as we&#39;d like to see that, &quot;Ahh  HAA, we knew the &#39;deep state&#39; was involved...&quot;, it is not out of the realm of possibility that this guy just did this on a whim wanting to go out with a bang.  </p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve had all the money you could need, experienced everything you cared to experience, why not go down in flames like that?  Perhaps he was just after the post-mortum notoriety for some reason.  People may not have known his name from Adam before, but you can bet his name will not soon be forgotten, sadly.  </p>

<p>You realize you are only seeing what MGM and NY Times <em>want</em> you to see, right? This is a hand selected tiny sample of video clips with no time stamps. To counter your point, we see nothing to dispute that this man was a framed patsy that had nothing to do with the shooting. It can go <em>either way</em>. </p>
