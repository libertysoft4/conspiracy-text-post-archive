It&#39;s on the radio, it&#39;s on TV, magazines everywhere. Vegan this and vegan that. Super veg that has nearly the same texture of meat. Celebrity chiefs give up on eating meat etc. 
Just recently heard aswell, some head boffin wants to introduce a meat tax (at 20%) to tackle obesity. That&#39;s not just on processed meat. That&#39;s red meat too. 
I have a dreading feeling that meat will again become a luxury item, priced out of reach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you eat real food you do t get fat. Literally.</p>

<p>I&#39;m eating junk and processed shit but sticking to my calories and I stay around 270lbs. I can eat the same calories in really food (fresh meat, green veggies and dairy and it drops off me without effort.) Sadly sugar is a highly addictive substance same with corn, wheat and starchy vegetables as the body metobalises it into sugar (glycogen) </p>

<p>So no, meat is not making people fat. Cheaply made nothing foods full of empty calories is what&#39;s making people fat because the body doesn&#39;t get what it needs nutritionally and you&#39;re basically fall and still starving. </p>

<p>They need to find better alternatives for farming meat. They can have a rotation of land, let the cows live there plant shit in it when they&#39;re done using all the cow shit as fertiliser. Here in the north of England that&#39;s a common process. Literally by my aunt&#39;s house near the moors there are four fields that have trees in them that get rotated.  In the first year one field will have cows in another will be left open, two have trees. They chop the trees put them on the old cow field for mulch to replensh the land and plant new ones in the first open field. Move cows to freshly chopped field. Repeat. That way the amount of trees is the same. The land has useful turnover and the birds have new trees to live in when they migrate back. If more places had a simmilar turnover for the land we wouldn&#39;t be fucking up so much new land. </p>

<p>I see people advocating for eating less meat and pushing veganism but that&#39;s just as destructive as you need open space to grow crops. I know there&#39;s plans to make multistory greenhouses but realistically how is that any better than battery hens. Same thing to me only there isn&#39;t a conscious animal involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people on this planet are <em>basically</em> vegetarians. This is what I said. Most people can not afford meat, or only afford a little bit like 1 chicken per month or 1 small fish per week etc. It has nothing to do with naturally being omnivores.</p>

<p>You can use the tax to buy rainforest and then leave it alone, f.ex. instead of letting McDonalds purchase meat from Brazilian producers that cut down rainforest to put cattle on that land. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. 
I think the key is to treat the meat as a side dish instead of the main course.</p>

<p>F.ex. in China or Africa most people will eat a little bit of meat and a lot of e.g. rice. Whereas in the west people will eat a lot of meat and a little rice/potatoes.</p>

<p>You could probably easily stretch f.ex. 1 rabbit to a whole week or longer by doing it the Chinese way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a misconception.  Visit markets in Asia. Meat is everywhere.  And the Masai eat meat and milk and trade for veggies etc.  They are very healthy.  The Inuit survive almoat exclusively on animal.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been lied to by grain industry, AMA, govt agencies etc.  They villify the cheap and easy to obtain traditional foods for laboratory created processed foods &quot;balanced&quot; by so-called experts with limited understanding of our nutritional needs.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you read a book written a long time ago by a dentist who was curious why &quot;modern&quot; people had so many tooth decay and crowding issues while not westernized populations with traditional diets did not.</p>

<p>He traveled the world and made astonishing discoveries.  And none of them were beneficial to big industry and government control so they&#39;ve been suppressed.</p>

<p>Yeah lots of meat, but how much does the individual actually eat on a daily basis? and I don&#39;t mean people in big cities, I mean rural which is most of them.</p>

<p>If that book has been &#39;supressed&#39; then how come it is available online?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I leaned that way for a while until recently. It&#39;s a law of one, spiritual reason for me. The propagation of life has taken a new importance for me. Gardening took new importance. I used to go out of my way as a kid to step on ants for some reason (I was (am?) a selfish asshole). These days I liken avoiding eating meat to avoiding stepping on ants if that makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where to begin? The use of pesticides, particularly cancer-causing Round-Up, has wreaked havoc on our systems. Agricultural runoff, especially from pig farms (see North Carolina), is causing dead zones and horrible health problems for nearby neighbors. Farming practices have led to nutrient deficiencies in food, up to 70% (we don’t even know what food should taste like anymore.) The sugar industry took all their notes from the tobacco companies. Processed meats are known carcinogens and yet the American Heart Association continues to include recipes on their website including bacon. </p>

<p>One of my faves is this guy Howard Lyman, ie The Mad Cowboy. His book is super short and worth the read. Basically he was a fourth generation cattle farmer who almost died of his heavy meat diet and destroyed the soil of his family’s farm, then had a remarkable change of heart after a life-saving surgery. He went on to become a vegan, lobbying against Big Meat in Washington. At one point he went on Oprah, and Big Meat came after both him AND Oprah, claiming violation of Ag Gag laws. Yup, in many states it’s actually illegal to say anything disparaging against the meat industry.</p>

<p>I loved reading the China Study, one of the things that actually opened me up to conspiracy. T Colin Campbell was a doctor, not a Vegan, who went to the Philippines to investigate a spate of children getting cancer. It turned out to be the rich kids who ate dairy, and it was casein activating a particular cancer causing gene at the root of it. His rat and mice experiments are INSANE.</p>

<p>Tons of great documentaries out there. Food Inc, Cowspiracy, What the Health, Earthlings, etc. William Engdahls Seeds of Destruction about Monsanto is a thrilling read. DEEP conspiracy happening over there.</p>

<p>Basically, human bodies are designed to eat mostly plants, especially fruits and veg we can pluck off the vine. I’m not going to say everyone should be Vegan, because that would cause a fight, but at the very least we should be eating far less meat than currently. Excess protein turns into fat. Milk from other animals isn’t meant for us, it’s meant for their babies. Even michael pollen, of The Omnivores Dilemma and a MSM staple, admits we should be eating maybe a couple ounces a day. </p>

<p>Hope this is enough to get you started. I didn’t include links but it’s all easily google-able and it’s a rabbit hole I’ve been going down for a few years now. Just remember— we are what we eat. So if we are consuming hormone pumped, antibiotic fed, tortured animals, well, just look at the state of America. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but it has no relation to ecology, it is about profits. </p>

<p>The profits will be huge for insect proteins compared to beef, chicken and pork and there is a disaster in the loss of the food from the oceans.  </p>

<p>What remains, will be reserved for the top 1% only. The rest of us get larvae and insect protein. </p>

<p>The propaganda move to drive us away from meat began about 20 years ago.  National Geographic is one of the leaders in anti-meat eating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. 
I think the key is to treat the meat as a side dish instead of the main course.</p>

<p>F.ex. in China or Africa most people will eat a little bit of meat and a lot of e.g. rice. Whereas in the west people will eat a lot of meat and a little rice/potatoes.</p>

<p>You could probably easily stretch f.ex. 1 rabbit to a whole week or longer by doing it the Chinese way. </p>
