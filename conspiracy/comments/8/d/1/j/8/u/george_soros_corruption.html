    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m really not, you&#39;re vastly underplaying it. Soros is a very powerful person, and an outspoken enemy of Trump. This investigation is already highly politicized.

<p>That is exactly what federal judges are expected to do. Recusal comes into play if any persons involved in the hearing or case have a conflict of interest with the judge.

<p>How do you not see this as a conflict of interest? I&#39;m not saying that this investigation should stop- but Soros is a highly outspoken political enemy of Trump, and the Judge and her husband have connections to him, both personal and business. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like only Trump supporters are allowed to do anything in this world according to Trump supporters. Boys crying wolf non fucking stop.</p>

<p>Well, I&#39;m not a Trump supporter, you can check my post/submission history for proof of that, but I am a citizen who is highly concerned with the precedent this sets and the politicization of this entire investigation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The people overseeing these investigations were Trump picks. They have seen enough to feel obligated to proceed as they have.</p>

<p>And many have recused themselves and been replaced with more impartial people. Cohen deserves a fair shot at Justice, and this judge has too many connections to his political enemies. </p>
