        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It started with the more common <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf">Mars remote viewing</a> doc that has been circulated previously, which seems far-fetched, that led down a rabbit hole into much more practical instances of remote viewing sessions conducted by the CIA during Project Stargate.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00789R003700710001-3.pdf">Project N-1 X protocol regarding the use of RV to collect intelligence that isn&#39;t readily perceptible</a></p></li>
<li><p>Plenty of instances of the remote viewer&#39;s notes and drawings of their perceptions of the target <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00789R000500100002-4.pdf">like this one</a> or <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00789R000700580003-9.pdf">like this one</a>, often eerily accurate (such that it is statistically significant)</p></li>
<li><p>Stanford Research Institute is a recurring institution in the docs. They conducted scientifically sound experiments (or so they appear, I am no expert) and double-blind studies that examined with success the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00791R000300030004-9.pdf">abilities of remote viewing</a>, and even attempted to <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00787R000300300001-7.pdf">study remote action</a> (i.e. manipulating physical objects with your mind) There was an RA experiment even <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00787R000300070001-3.pdf">involving marine mammals</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are only a few that I came across just by scraping the surface. Anyone have any further context to add to this program? Any additional sources that discuss this? Any light to shed on the topic? I cannot believe that this ability has actually been tested before by the U.S. with scientifically rigorous success, and I&#39;m curious why this isn&#39;t more well-known. Has it been debunked? What is the state of its progress today, if it was like this over 40 years agin? Love to get a discussion going about this for sure, it&#39;s fascinating!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it honestly kind of freaks me out! From the little research I&#39;ve been doing, it supposedly works best when two &quot;psychics&quot; are involved in a type of mental interaction. They don&#39;t necessarily need to know what the target is (and actually it&#39;s often that they both don&#39;t), but the results are stronger when the supervisor and the remote viewer both have the psychic RV talent, or when they said a psychic to the target site and have the remote viewer perceive psychic via RV.</p>

<p>Psychic was their terminology too, which was interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No its real.  I&#39;ve done it.  </p>

<p>You should also look into astral projection.  It&#39;s like remote viewing but you actually can leave your body with your consciousness and do pretty much whatever you can imagine.</p>

<p>This is what monks do when they meditate for hours on end.  They are exploring the infinite capabilities of consciousness.  </p>

<p>There are many books and a ton of websites about both remote viewing and astral projection. I&#39;ve been studying both for about 15 years now.  It&#39;s hard to control but it is very real.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>a ton of astral projection stories.  </p>

<p>one time i astral projected and flew off my balcony and landed across the street on the corner. </p>

<p>There was a guy there in a  black trench coat and told me to try a pill he gave me.  </p>

<p>Me believing, i am invincible out of body, didnt think twice.  Ate the pill.  It sent me into what i can only describe as a very confusing DMT trip which lasted for what felt like 8 hours.  I eventually snapped out of the trance and ended up standing on the corner next to the dude in the trench coat. </p>

<p>He asked me what i thought... I just shook my head and was mind blown, i decided to wake up and looked at the clock. Only one had passed.  It was one of the craziest experiences I&#39;ve had.  </p>

<p>One time i astral projected and spent about 4 days in conscious realm doing random tasks which i later realized were lessons or tests on how or if i use my consciousness properly. After completing the puzzles which lasted a day each, I was confronted by each &quot;boss&quot; i had to out think in each experience.  They congratulated me a long with a couple of other people i didnt recognize on passing their consciousness tests.   </p>

<p>I woke up and only about 2 hours had passed.  </p>

<p>I think i&#39;ve healed a knee problem one time. while out of body i blasted my knee with electric energy until i actually felt pain.  When i woke up my knee problem was completely gone.</p>

<p>When i first started realizing the power of my mind i astral projected and decided i wanted to hit the mega ramp on a skateboard so i tried to manifest a mega ramp in front of me through though.  I closed my eyes, opened them up, and nothing was there still.  So i thought fuck it, and flew on top of this parking garage where there happened to be a mega ramp.</p>

<p>Sometimes ill manifest orbs of energy between my hands. 
Sometimes ill morph into a bird or wolf or something, this is really hard to do though.  I&#39;ve done it maybe twice.  </p>

<p>One time I astral projected and woke up on a bench (in the astral)  i thought about just flipping my point of view upside down.  My entire reality flipped upside down and i started hearing and feeling things in like a glitchy electronic sort of way.  It scared the shit out of me but i was fine.  </p>

<p>One time i astral projected to what seemed like the future.  It seemed like venice beach with a ton of street performers and insane futuristic buildings.  One of the buildings was an arcade if thats what you wanna call it.  I got in line to play mario.  They sat me in a future chair and put a helmet on my head.  I was transported into a video game and i was mario.  I was playing mario as mario in a 3d n64 style graphic world.   Jumping was weird so i was killed almost immediately by a koopa.  Popped out of the world sitting in the chair and they made me get back in line.  That was a crazy experience.  </p>

<p>So many experiences, too many, still practice every morning.  It&#39;s an infinite virtual reality playground.  </p>

<p>Side effects in real life though, I swear sometimes im psychic...  It will also completely change you as a person.  That being said, i highly recommend it.  </p>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-4" data-depth="4" data-id="dxo7610">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/hylozics.html">hylozics</a> 2018-04-20</p>
    <div class="md"><p>haha. I&#39;ll try.  It took me like three month of practice everyday and ton of reading different techniques to eventually have one.  </p>

<p>As far as substances and vitamins, eat healthy food.  Stay as healthy as possible.  I noticed when i go vegetarian, and cut out bread and cheese, it is a lot easier to accomplish.    Look up techniques to decalcify your pineal gland.  Fish oil is one way, distilled water is supposed to help as well.   </p>

<p>Also mediation helps with your feet on the ground, either standing or sitting, twice a day every day for about 20 minutes. 
What i do is try to clear my mind completely of all thoughts, to goal is to literally lower your brain waves to theta.  Feel your body and understand that it is 99.9% empty space.   Try to feel the empty space.  Breath in and out deeply feeling your body breathe in air through the pours of your skin.  Try to feel a magnetic presence surrounding your body, flowing into your body on the breaths and bubbling out on the out breath.  Pick a part of your body and focus on it.  Try to only feel that part of your body (say your heart chakra) and breathe in air through it keeping focus on feeling it contract on the inbreathe and expand on the out breath.  Only focus on the feeling and imagine seeing colorful energy pouring in and out of your heart. Do this from head to toe on every part of your body.  </p>

<p>You will start to feel an electromagnetic bubble expanding and contracting around your body.  This is basically the mediation i do which seems to power up my consciousness for the night.  </p>

<p>When i actually try to astral project i do a very similar thing i just described.  But i will actually contract and relax my muscles to help get into a super relaxed physical state.  Do this twice while laying in bed imagining colorful energy pouring into your body charging it up on the in breath, and completely relaxing on the out breath.  </p>

<p>you might start to feel a small vibration.  If you do, relax into that and let it completely engulf your body till it feels like your are shaking.  Increase that feeling until your body feels like it is violently shaking, yo might also have a high pitch noise accompanying these vibrations.  This is completely normal, it will not hurt you, you are not in an earthquake.  Keep increasing those vibrations until it feels literally violent and you can&#39;t take it any more, you will pop out of your body and be standing next to your sleeping physical body.  </p>

<p>Another thing that could happen is you&#39;ll end up in what feels like 3d blackness.  kinda just floating around thinking with no feeling of your physical body and nothing to see.  Try to look for a speck of light or a vague mist and kinda float towards it, sometimes these will become entire landscapes that you can explore.   Or ill try to feel the ground for my feet and do the mediation i talked about.  That seems to power me up while in a  projection too, then a reality will just sort of manifest itself infront of you.  </p>

<p>Main thing is don&#39;t be afraid, none of this will hurt you, infact it will most likely benefit you.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah its a very fine line between lucid dreaming and astral projection.  </p>

<p>In these realms its very easy to influence what is happening with just thoughts and feelings.  </p>

<p>Sometimes i will astral project and look around my room and it will be exactly like the physical.   The house will be the same, everything is exactly the same.  As i progress through the experience things become more fluid and change according to my level of awareness maybe.  </p>

<p>Honestly im still trying to figure it all out even after having maybe thousands of OBEs.  </p>

<p>Are you saying it isn&#39;t natural and some people make sure we go through the 4 stages?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  I’m saying that as far as solar, cosmological cycles go, it’s <em>extremely</em> natural.  Also, as far as these stellar cycles go, it’s ultimately not very much up to people what evolutionary age they manifest in.  If you, for example, manifest in, say, the Kali Yuga, as we who are all here have (<a href="http://www.mother-god.com/kali-yuga.html">1</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga">2</a>), then the overwhelming majority of action on the part of humans will be exceedingly negative and service-to-self.  Some have said we are still in this Yuga (<a href="https://grahamhancock.com/dmisrab6/">1</a>), <a href="http://isha.sadhguru.org/blog/yoga-meditation/science-of-yoga/kali-yuga-end-lies-ahead/">2</a> and others have said we are just now beginning to leave it.  Regardless, the point is that we have been in some rough, very low-energy times that will adversely affect everyone regardless of who it is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or people know about the Yugas cycles and are just taking advantage of it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not so much that people are taking advantage of the Yuga cycles.  It’s more that this particular Yuga we are at the tail end of is known as the “Age Of Vice”, so the beings that manifest here - human and non-human - again, again, exceedingly service-to-self, so they will tend to take advantage of things at the expense of others.  This in no way excuses the actions, but it does account for it.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Emfpzv5.png">This is a graph of all the yugas, how long they last, and certain major characteristics of each one.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do they have anything to do with meteorites?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not in the sense that they are influenced by meteorites.  Here’s what’s happening where it regards Yugas:</p>

<p>We don’t live in a singular star system where the sun is by itself.  We live in a binary solar system where Sirius A is said to be the Sun’s sister star.  These two stars are in orbit around each other.  The further apart they get, the less their collective (and individual) energies are.  The closer they get to one another, the stronger and more powerful those energies are.</p>

<p>Stars emanate and are influenced by electro-magneto-gravitic (emg) energy.  Everything has this energy in certain degrees.  Stars have a lot of it.  The closer two starts are to each other, the more powerful their emg signatures are as well as the influence they have on the surrounding planetary bodies around them.  The further apart the stars are, the weaker they and their planets are.  Just like two magnets.  The further apart they are form one another, the less they influence each other.  The closer they are, the more powerful their influence on one another.</p>

<p>The sun and Sirius A had been in <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/aphelion">aphelion</a> from each other - hence their relative weakness and the weakness of all their respective planets and all the beings living on those planets.  They are <em>just</em> beginning to round the corner of aphelion, however, and are finally making their way back around toward each other.  Given that their relative proximities to each other has decreased (i.e. they’re getting/have gotten a bit closer to one another), their energies have gone up just a little bit.  That increase in collective energy is what signifies and delineates the different yogas - the closer the stars are to one another, the more powerful and energetic are the stars and their surrounding planets and life forms on all those planets.  Everything functions on a faster vibratory frequency - a higher, more evolved frequency - as the stars get closer and closer (again, just like two magnets - except in this case, the magnets are absolutely <em>massive</em> and are the size of stars).  At <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/perihelion?s=t">perihelion</a>, things will be at their highest order - likely unimaginably so to our current viewpoints - but as the initial graph I linked above shows, we’re a few million years away from that still.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I’m not familiar with Randell, but Hancock has always had very good information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and these cycles kinda go hand in hand with the bible, people being giants and living hundreds of years.</p>

<p>Yep.  There’s a lot of fiction in the bible, but also quite a lot of truth as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the Info man, honestly really informative and well explained. </p>

<p>And Randell Carlson is a geologist who agrees with Hancock based in his findings. He found evidence of a massive flood probly caused by an asteroid that hit the North Pole somewhere 12.8 thousand years ago. He and Hancock hit it off on Joe rogans podcast, I really recommend it.</p>

<p>If people don&#39;t believe Hancock&#39;s &quot;hippy spiritual bullshit&quot;, well there a scientist who agrees with him and is pretty articulate about the subject. I find they&#39;re the perfect mix for people who usually dismiss these things.

Rupert Sheldrake tried to do it after he wrote a scientific book that demonstrated over 1000 dogs and around 600 cats have demonstrated telepathy. They didn&#39;t pay. If they were truly interested and open-minded, can I get them to blast off on DMT and take the money? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No lol I&#39;m asking your opinion on sleep paralysis, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s the same thing. I&#39;ve just heard that it&#39;s the body getting stuck in the transition phase unexpectedly. </p>

<p>The second time I got it I wasn&#39;t asleep, I was on the phone with my ex trying to fall asleep, every time I was about to fall asleep my ears would ring and then my body would zap in half, like a muscle spasm that made me do a sit up In bed. About the 10th time of that happening was when the sleep paralysis happened, but I wasn&#39;t asleep yet. I remember FaceTiming my mom at 4am telling her to watch me incase it happened again. I was so scared, the ceiling fan started moving to the right of my visions and I could feel my body being pulled to the left, I felt like my head was gonna crash into my night stand, lasted about 10 seconds then everything went back to normal but I was soaked it sweat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I get you now. </p>

<p>Yes sleep paralysis always seems like you&#39;re trapped in a limbo between consciousness and unconsciousness. It&#39;s an interesting place to be and I wonder if you could refine your ability to control yourself in it. Maybe by overcoming the fear. I&#39;ve seen beings in sleep paralysis and I wonder if it is just my mind playing tricks on me (as the doctors will say) or if I&#39;m really seeing real entities somehow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my whole thing with remote viewing lately is that it would be pretty damn easy to prove these remote views were bullshitting if that was the case. like, tell your partner to go into another room and ask the remote viewer how many fingers he&#39;s holding up. or give him an address across the world and ask him to describe the building, then check for accuracy. so either this is legit, and they have this ability, OR they just want their enemies to think they really have a psychic army so they leak these documents.  fascinating stuff though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was kind of big deal but as the scrutiny intensified with things like the internet its luster has faded. If remote viewing worked people would be diving locations of lost treasures and hitting lotto numbers. This stuff doesn&#39;t happen on that level, it&#39;s either theatre of the mind or some sort of function of our brain we&#39;ve yet to comprehend. This is all my opinion of course but I just don&#39;t see the proof. Just a bunch of fascinating tales</p>

<p>Remote viewing, remote mind control, and other related phenomenon have been studied and advanced for decades. Imagine what all that time and an unlimited budget could achieve? You can be sure it&#39;s been weaponized. Here is something you may not know, consciousness is related to the very nature of our existence and is related directly to &quot;ufos&quot; and various paranormal  activity. The agency calls it &quot;phenomenology&quot;. I believe it&#39;s also related to how the universe works. </p>

They believed they got wiped out 4 times by catastrophic events IIRC, and the older I get the more I think back and realize they&#39;re probly right. Funny how the cycle has 4.</p>

<p>I could find this out later but how long are the cycles? Do they have anything to do with meteorites? Thinking about Hancock and  Randell. </p>
