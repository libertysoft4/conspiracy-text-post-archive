    <div class="md"><p>I literally can remember the entire environment while it was happening. And I remember a lot of stuff from my past. People I have known since I was a kid, I will bring random memories up and they will say “HOW DO YOU REMEMBER THAT??”</p>

<p>I’ll give you the whole memory right now. I had my hair combed over with gel freshly brushed through it, waiting for my brothers to come in the back room while my mom was doing their hair. The sun was shining through the 3 windows that is towards the east. I was standing there with my backpack alone in the living room waiting for them and the news was on. It just stopped at a commercial and then went back to the news and this guy, slicked sideways brownish black hair sitting there in a building that has a clear view of New York and the towers saying “Good morning America” with a huge smile and all of a sudden a plane comes from left field smashing into one of them. And all of a sudden he freaks out and gets really scared. Then says something just happened and they will be back. And then the channel stops. I run to the back of the house screaming for my mom cause I had no idea what happened and told her something just blew up on the news and she doesn’t believe me and almost every channel is tuned into New York. Nickelodeon, MTV, CartoonNetwork, EVERY NEWS CHANNEL, just showing smoke from the building. I can’t make this stuff up man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you are confused between the first building being hit and the second. All channels did not start showing the WTC until after the second plane hit, so your memory doesn&#39;t make sense. (People didn&#39;t realize it was a terrorist attack or even on purpose until the second plane hit, they just thought it was a horrible accident).</p>

<p>You were young and it was a massive event that people talked about and you watched TV about for months, if not years, after. False memories happen.</p>

<p>There has to be, but they were probably taken by men in black suits, if you catch my drift. You&#39;d think there were cameras on at least a few of the skyscrapers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was 25 and watching tv when it happened. The first reports from the US all had one already smoking tower and then the 2nd plane was seen. </p>

<p>It wasnt until the following day i saw the first plane hit on the naudet film. </p>

<p>Although I wasnt watching US news at all when the first plane actually hit, so i cant verify or deny your memory but I&#39;m sure somebody else would have seen it and spoken out by now?</p>

<p>Maybe your memory of the day is fuddled as you were quite young at the time and seeing everything go to shit would have definitely had some sort of psychological effect on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only real 911 evidence from eye witnesses and fire fighters in those buildings is that explosions  brought down the building. Which is consistent  with the demolition  evidence of thermite and the free fall speeds of collapse we witness. Everything else is part of the conspiracy and we may never know what aspects they forged or inserted later to create confusion to distract from the demolition evidence. The planes abd various other aspects could have been forged as the number independents footages are limited, which makes suspect if the whole hijacking thing was a cover up of the demo.</p>

<p>I’ll give you the whole memory right now. I had my hair combed over with gel freshly brushed through it, waiting for my brothers to come in the back room while my mom was doing their hair. The sun was shining through the 3 windows that is towards the east. I was standing there with my backpack alone in the living room waiting for them and the news was on. It just stopped at a commercial and then went back to the news and this guy, slicked sideways brownish black hair sitting there in a building that has a clear view of New York and the towers saying “Good morning America” with a huge smile and all of a sudden a plane comes from left field smashing into one of them. And all of a sudden he freaks out and gets really scared. Then says something just happened and they will be back. And then the channel stops. I run to the back of the house screaming for my mom cause I had no idea what happened and told her something just blew up on the news and she doesn’t believe me and almost every channel is tuned into New York. Nickelodeon, MTV, CartoonNetwork, EVERY NEWS CHANNEL, just showing smoke from the building. I can’t make this stuff up man.</p>
