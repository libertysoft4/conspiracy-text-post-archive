    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Wayyy to be extremely fucking ignorant. Do coffee addicts think about scoring their next cup CONSTANTLY??? What about cigarette smokers???? </p>

<p>Most &quot;illegal&quot; drug addicts are completely fucking stealth and use maintenance medications to just stay out of withdrawals while not changing their behavior or judgement. The only reason you hear about &quot;junkies&quot; so much is because they are the only addicts who allow themselves to be visible and that&#39;s only because they have learned habits which are self destructive. Most drug addicts figure out at some point that taking methadone or something similar makes their situation more manageable and negates the mental consequences of constantly seeking pleasure and euphoria. Everyday in public you probably pass by or even interact with several low key drug addicts. </p>

<p>Source: volunteered in a drug rehab, and my friend&#39;s brother. I&#39;ve never even tried drugs myself. </p>

<p>For most drug addicts taking their medication is no more eventful than taking care of any other bodily function. They are lucky if they get even a mild buzz less than coffee or tobacco, and the way these medications work is they relieve craving and withdrawal without getting a tolerant user high.</p>

<p>And btw kratom is legal right now and it hasn&#39;t significantly caused more cases of addiction. We need to make methadone and other options for maintenance more available because right now most addicts get it on the black market. Also they need to sell then anonymously because no smart drug addict will put their name on some goddamn government fucking list! And right now the only doctors that deal with this shit are ones with a sketchy past or the ones that only accept huge sums of cash... not practical for solving the problem with street junkies and problem addicts!!! They charge higher fucking prices than they do on the street!!!! </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be part of the problem. There is a literal genocide against addicts going on. Hitler sent them to deathcamps.. you think it&#39;s good to put them in cages??? Soon the outrage culture will realize this hypocrisy and the people who supported the drug war will be treated like racists, slave owners, homophobes, or neonazis. Just 20 years ago being gay was still taboo. But now they are a protected minority class just like every other category of human that hitler sent to deathcamps... don&#39;t be on the wrong side of history!!</p>

<p>And the drug war incentivizes addicts spreading their addiction. Most of the stealth addicts hide their addiction from everyone including their friends and family. But for poor drug addicts struggling to maintain their addiction they will seek out people to get addicted so they can middle them shit to support themselves.. my friend&#39;s brother got hooked by some guy while he was walking home from school. The drug war incentivizes this behavior by making drugs hard to get and expensive! And you have to empathize with these addicts because if someone was starving then you can&#39;t blame them for stealing! Drugs affect the same part of the brain that survival instincts do. </p>

<p>And only 5 percent of drug addicts can get sober. Most of them will attempt sobriety at some point but most of them still feel like shit even 5 years after quitting. It&#39;s not realistic to expect them to stay sober... it&#39;s fucking impossible. You would do drugs to if your brain was permanently altered and you felt like living hell everyday of your life! The rehab industry, like Dr Drew, lies to the public by saying that sobriety is right for everyone! And think about how AA and NA are all about a higher power relieving the drug addict&#39;s addiction... it&#39;s the only physiological problem that doctors will prescribe prayer and say that a higher power has to heal them!!! Wtf imagine if doctors would prescribe prayer to help cancer!! That is straight up PROOF that this whole anti-drug culture is full of fucking shit! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>where did I say put em in camps?</p>

<p>Actually, I agree with most of what youre saying here.</p>

<p>Except the part where you seem to think addicts dont go into full on crave mode where they will do whatever to avoid getting dope sick.
  As a professional hippy,who has lived in more then a few sketchy nieghborhoods in my time, Ive seen first hand what addicts will do when their supply is threatened.</p>

<p>Well you doing anything to avoid it as well!!!!!! I&#39;ve heard it described as a bad acid trip for weeks on end with additional physical pain!!! I&#39;ve never done acid but that sounds horrible and I know it&#39;s much worse than &quot;the flew times ten&quot; that everyone describes it as. And withdrawals get worse for them every time they go through them through something known as the &quot;kindling effect&quot; so the older junkies must be going through unbelievable hell on earth. Imagine if you hadn&#39;t eaten for a few days or drank water... the same part of the brain which control survival instincts is what controls cravings like these. I just read a book about the true story behind &quot;Moby Dick&quot; where sailors in a small boat ran out of food and had to cast lots to eat eachother.. It&#39;s the same fucking feeling for these poor drug addicts.</p>

<p>My point though was that for every problem junkie that has a hard time supplying himself there is another super stealth addict who you would never know has a problem. I know this because I met their friends when I volunteered at a rehab center thing. It became apparent that there is a population of drug addicts walking around just like normal members of the public. They usually take something like kratom or buprenorphine or methadone and they just get their pills quietly and don&#39;t even tell their normie friends or family. These people are not likely to show up at the clinics though because they are smart and don&#39;t want their name on some junkie deathcamp list. But I would meat these people when they would bring in one of their old junkie friends that couldn&#39;t take care of himself. </p>

<p>Humans are dependent on external factors. Drug addicts just have one more thing they have to worry about, but in the modern world there is no excuse for not being able to provide something as cheap to manufacture as a simple medication. It should be just as available to drug addicts as food or water!! I have heard from pharmaceutical insiders that they have much cheaper ways of making this stuff but they still keep these shady government deals with opium producers for certain illicit and political reasons. Basically if you have the license required to import afghan opium it wouldn&#39;t be in your interest to forfeit that, but the top narcotic pharmaceutical companies have ways of producing fully synthetic morphine on a mass scale, and the drugs could be as cheap as tylenol! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s sooooo sad... all the best artwork comes from drugs... so degenerate!</p>

<p>Here is something to think about. Megalithic stone structures first occurred historically when early humans developed agriculture. The more comfort that eccentric humans have then the more creativity that society produces! When farming was around that created an opportunity for men that couldn&#39;t be warriors or hunters! Drugs increase creativity! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then why are you making posts trying to shame pharmaceutical companies?!? They do other bad things but providing individuals with substances that they willingly decide to put in their own bodies is not one of them! </p>

<p>And ofc they are going to say their product is not addictive!! What kind of person is able to have an unbiased opinion about something they are selling!! It&#39;s fucking atrocious that human nature becomes illegal and companies have to face consequences for a very common mistake and this system does not produce the best results anyways!!! </p>

<p>You know what would actually help??!?! HAVING A THIRD PARTY, a private third party, be the one that fucking tells people the risks and shit like that. There are all kinds of consumer advocacy groups, or at least there used to be before the government decided  to become monopolous about it!!!!!!  </p>

<p>Seriously, if you trust a corporation or the government about something then, just like Darwinism, you will probably suffer consequences! There is no way these groups could EVER be unbiased!!!!!! This is fucking RETARDED!!!!!!! </p>

<p>And worst of all people have this mentality that they are entitled to being protected when it comes to their own personal choices like what medications they put in their body. This directly LEADS TO prohibition and bureaucratic control of prescriptions!! But of course now that fucking trust in bureaucracy, ie doctors writing prescriptions that are supposedly safe, can be hijacked by pharmaceutical companies which are inherently biased!!!!! </p>

<p>Be part of the solution bro!! Freedom and personal responsibility! I took a medicine for almost a decade that I found out increases my likelihood of developing certain kinds of cancers. You know who I blame???? MYSELF! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know that when the CIA introduced crack it wasn&#39;t a psyops aimed at white suburban neighborhoods and honestly there aren&#39;t many people overall that would question the motives or know the identities of those people in the CIA.   That&#39;s the kind of shit that can get you killed, I&#39;m sure.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty common knowledge that there is a market for dependency and the worst offending substances are government-regulated.  If you want to blame the CIA for the rules that big pharma plays with their distributors, well, I guess that would be a start to a conversation about how our medical system is structured  by asking what sort of care is rewarded and how is that measured.</p>

<p>Americans are a long way off from that one.  I&#39;d imagine there would have to be some kind of mass-revelation to embrace policy that didn&#39;t immediately reward behavior which resulted in profits.  I think it&#39;s more likely that the fines endured for violating addiction paradigms become the cost of doing business. </p>

<p>Seriously, just because you&#39;re boring and autistic, that doesn&#39;t mean that people that know how to party or expand their mind are all evil and their culture is artificiall implanted by the CIA or something. Seriously you are just making excuses for being lame and boring. <em>You must be fun at parties.</em></p>

<p>Btw I am saying this as someone who has never tried drugs HAHAHA. But even from my perscpective I can see that drug culture is not all bad and the culture part is actually pretty harmless... only stupid teenagers are influenced negatively by it! And if your children have access to drugs then you have failed as a parent! Adults can surely handle parts of culture that deal with risky behavior, just like certain kinds of pornography! Even pure hedonism has created art and creativity!! </p>

<p>Is MOTOR CYCLE culture harmful and a CIA plot?!??!? They kill almost as many people as drugs?!??! Holy fuck, is automobile culture a product of the CIA and satanism to?!??! Bwahahahahahaha, you &quot;muh degeneracy,&quot; posters make me LAUGH!! </p>

<p>I&#39;m one of those boring autistic guys that focuses on work instead of partying but even I can see that so called &quot;drug culture,&quot; ie fun, is beneficial overall!!!!!!!! Think where we would be if the cultural revolution of the 60s or even 90s didn&#39;t happen!!!!! You really must not appreciate art at all??? </p>
