    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read countless theories about the elites wanting to trim down the earth population. Lies and deception, they can&#39;t tell you upfront, they can&#39;t reveal it, so they could have indeed a plan to just fuck the weather system. </p>

<p>Now is it this ? This feeling most of us have that something&#39;s about to pop. I have no clue if this is it. </p>

<p>One thing is sure, many agendas are being executed right before our eyes and I can&#39;t believe people just let this happen. On another side, I have no clue how one would go out pointing finger at the government without looking like a fool. I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;re just fucked at this point lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man I completely agree with you. I thought I was the only one with the feeling... definitely strange. </p>

<p>Regarding the hidden agendas. Absolutely no doubt about it. Look into it people, the food is rotten, and poisonous in the USA. They are trying to reduce life spans of people. Cardi B came out and said on IG live then the video was completely removed from the internet. Not a trace. And I watched it! I managed to find 1 version, but the part about the food is muted. Very very strange. </p>

<p>Countless others things being executed under our noses (and in plain sight), just wish I knew what they were. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I think the reason people let this happen is because they&#39;re consumed by instant gratification and non sense distractions planned by the government, higher ups, and elitits through social media to strategically distract the masses </p>

<p>Unfortunately you&#39;re right, and when I start hypothesizing about anything nowadays outside of the norm, people immediately think I need a tin foil hat. Smh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, seems like every bit of our world has been figured out well before us. We are just as they need it. Asleep, watching t.v. countless hours, burning time with whatever our hobbies are.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always said it, we are way too comfortable to even consider protesting, let alone have a great awakening of mass, as in everyone just clearly see throught their plotting suddently and feel betrayed/threatened. </p>

<p>The fact that we are having this discussion, on this forum, we are already in a database somewhere other than the one from reddit. </p>

<p>They have unlimited power and money, when we think of high technologies from the military the greatest achievement was made in the 60&#39;s or even before with their B-2&#39;s. We think of them as the holy bomber and the deliver of nuclear arms. </p>

<p>Can you, what ever your ideas or conceptions are, imagine what kind of weapons they have right now and how much has been hidden from the population? </p>

<p>Hopefully when this all ends we get a quick &quot;How fucked you were from the start&quot; video that explains how we ended locked inside our bodies as sentient beings, feeling useless about stuff going around, you know, all the why&#39;s and how&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like the problem with trimming the population using weather control is that it mostly affects people in rural places. Whereas the places that need more population control are the major cities where people are highly concentrated. It seems to me that people in cities affect weather negatively more so than people out in the countryside. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that’s what they want us to think, they’ve done a pretty good job by creating a theory in the 1800s that has stood every test done against it and then creating models over the past four decades that have shown over and over again that increased extremes (colder winters, hotter summers, more violent weather) is the inevitable result.</p>

William Cooper discussed climate change a bit, he said it’s a known hoax and we are entering another ice age. Our poles shifted recently, this is fact, as the Inuits have extra hours of hunting and the sun sets in a different place now. Who knows what it all means but bet we’ve been tricked for far longer than we know. Money , resources, and time = shaping of reality </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the technology for weather control has advanced so far that they do not need HAARP arrays any more. They can hijack weather stations and airport radars and use them to control/influence the weather (or something like that, I am not pretending that I have proof for this) . They cannot make a dry day wet but they can encourage cloud formation to speed up. They can&#39;t create earthquakes but perhaps they can fuck with the atmospherice pressure in a way that influences the oceans or tides that in turn can trigger tectonic plactes to slide.</p>

<p>My other theory is that TPTB are fucking with us, and they have zero control over the weather but are promoting the idea that they control it so they appear more powerful than they actually are. The airforce used this method to co-op the ufo sighting in the 40s and 50s by claiming that 98% of the sightings were military aircraft...there must be a name for this type of operation but it basically piggy backs on an  existing phenomena, like so called &quot;weird&quot; weather, and then points at a &quot;powerful shadow government&quot; run &quot;conspiracy&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, haarp was a big thing that they say is shutdown now but theres 30 odd other stations like it, also yeah to the holographic as they can easily fool us to think that a god is in the sky or that aliens are landing when in actual fact the aliens are coming out of the bottomless pit and are really demons</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our entire existence is a long con fwiw. Our reality as we know  has been planned out since the late 1800s/early 1900s. William Cooper discussed climate change a bit, he said it’s a known hoax and we are entering another ice age. Our poles shifted recently, this is fact, as the Inuits have extra hours of hunting and the sun sets in a different place now. Who knows what it all means but bet we’ve been tricked for far longer than we know. Money , resources, and time = shaping of reality </p>
