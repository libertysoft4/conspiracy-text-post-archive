        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First let me start of saying that having some soy sauce with your chinese isnt bad, but dont overdo it like the Japanese. The Japanese consume about 200x more soy products than Americans. Their fertility rate is falling (They are now reproducing at a lower rate than they are dying), they have an average penis size .8 inches less than Americans, more and more women are getting breast cancer (Which is proven that more estrogen gives a higher risk of breast cancer). This can all be explained simply. Soy products contain what is called photoestrogen. It mimics estrogen in the human body, thus making it dangerous. They are putting it in everything these days. They are trying to feed it to your babies through formula. Just my thoughts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also some more evidence is the increasing breast size in Japan. Estrogen is linked to Breast Cancer and Breast growth, along with low testosterone counts in men, and given soy is given to children a LOT in Japan it could be why their specific growth is not normal. With an increase of soy products in America that are in most foods that you feed your children, including baby formula it makes sense that the average breast size in women in America is increasing and the average penis size is decreasing. It is all a part of their agenda</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is circumstantial/non-sequator. Just to show, you could point to the fact that Japan&#39;s Math scores are ranked 25 places better than the US as evidence that soy &quot;enriches the mind&quot;. Does it? Idk, but there is as much evidence that soy enriches the mind as there is that it lowers testosterone in men. </p>

<p>Not only is there no evidence that soy is linked to lower testosterone, evidence has shown otherwise. Additionally the &quot;estrogen&quot; in it is not the same as the human Estrogen, so it doesn&#39;t function the same. THAT is the conspiracy, that idiots go around passing this off as hard truth without knowing anything about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously just used the first thing you found. So let&#39;s start with Dr. Miguel A. Delgado, the guy who says estrogen and soy are linked. He&#39;s a plastic surgeon, NOT a clinical researcher, so he is not qualified to talk about that. It does not say he found that in a study, it&#39;s just something he said. </p>

<p>Also Did you even read this?</p>

<p>&quot;A study published in the January 2002 edition of the “American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&quot; found that high levels of phytoestrogens did not cause gynecomastia or other estrogenic effects in healthy men.&quot; this is the first linked study that has any credibility. If you look at the first one (2008) it is obviously a case study, which means the results cannot and SHOULD not be extrapolated to the population. </p>

<p>Keep in mind as well, this is not a scholarly source, it&#39;s LIVESTRONG.com that you are citing. I provided a source published in a scientific journal dedicated to reproductive medicine. </p>

<p>I personally have issues with soy that are similar to oestrogen dominance symptoms. Does it just depend on the individual?</p>

<p>Additionally, if you&#39;re worried about &quot;estrogen dominance symptoms,&quot; then I would stay away from most animal products. Cow&#39;s milk and all meat contains <em>real mammal estrogen</em> that doesn&#39;t just mimic estrogen&#39;s effects like phytoestrogen (btw many plants contain phytoestrogens, not just soy). If increasing estrogen levels is a concern for you then you shouldn&#39;t be worried about soy, you should be worried about cow&#39;s milk and meat.</p>

Also it is recommended for pcos to eat ketogenic and avoid inflammatory stuff and carbs. So, good meat too. Free of additional hormones</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless, if you&#39;re worried about the estrogen content of your food, soy shouldn&#39;t be your biggest worry. Eat more fiber and reduce your consumption of animal products which contain <em>real</em> estrogen. I&#39;m not an expert on oestrogen dominance, but it is possible that reducing phytoestrogen consumption could help. That means most edible plants, including the hops in beer, should be avoided along with soy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get more hormonally dysbalanced eating primarily carbobydrates from vegetarian food, especially soy than eating proteins and fats from meat and fish. </p>

<p>There are studies showing that  genital arousal disorder is linked with increased soy intake for instance. Oestrogen dominance can cause that disorder. Im mentioning this because I have chronic pain associated with this severe hormonal dysbalance and changing my diet helped partly too. My pain got better on a lowcarb diet, free of soy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI this is known in the trans community that eating certain soy products does in fact help with overall estrogen globules attaching themselves to the other cells in your body.  It helps feminize you at fairly large quantities.  Works better if you&#39;re already on hormones though.</p>

<p>Animal meat with certain high levels of hormones that stay in the meat after cooking also have been shown to jump start puberty at earlier stages than normal.  </p>

<p>Note that <strong>doesn&#39;t</strong> mean you should be scared of eating soy, that you should be scared of &quot;demasculation&quot;, or that you should be scared to feed your kids bacon.  You may want to reduce the amounts of these things but a tofu dish with pan fried soybeans once a week isn&#39;t going to do anything negative to your body.</p>

<p>One study showed phytoestrogens greatly reducing hot flashes. Numerous other studies are finding positive effects for hot flashes and other perimenopausal symptoms, and more research is being conducted for this use of phytoestrogens.

<p>I could go on and on with this.  Studies show that it does in fact effect us in mostly positive ways(including men!)  OP is wrong about the &#39;negative&#39; effects of soy, and very wrong about soy sauce in particular.  Soy is good for you in moderate quantities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While Japan&#39;s fertility rate is falling, so is almost every other industrial nation. It&#39;s not a good thing, but it&#39;s not really that catastrophic if you consider how unsustainable the birth rate of the baby boom was (which is ultimately what we&#39;re comparing modern birth rates to). Urban populations tend to have lower birth rates than rural ones. High prices, crowding, disease, etc tends to put off family planning.</p>

<p>Penis size studies are notoriously un-rigorous, with small (lol) sample sizes and inconsistent measurement methodologies. You can cherrypick studies showing the Japanese being smaller than, equal to, or bigger than Americans.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you got the breast cancer statistic, because their rates of breast cancer (and cancer overall) are MUCH lower than ours (<a href="http://healthhubs.net/cancer/cancer-rates-in-the-usa-compared-to-japan/">http://healthhubs.net/cancer/cancer-rates-in-the-usa-compared-to-japan/</a>).</p>

<p>Plus, PHYTOestrogen =/= estrogen in the human body. Just because a molecule resembles another one doesn&#39;t mean they have the exact same pharmaceutical effect. If you have a molecule A that is similar enough to molecule B that it can bind to B&#39;s enzyme, but has a different ligand preventing it from detaching or activating it, it acts as an inhibitor, shutting down the activity of the enzyme. This is by far the most misunderstood thing about Soy.</p>

<p>But if you want to completely remove soy from your diet, that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s just a source of protein, and you can live without soy just fine. You still won&#39;t be like your caveman ancestors. I&#39;d worry more about the unnecessary hormones in our meat, or the added sugars, esp fructose (ESP from Corn syrup), and all the other shit that goes into processed food</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guy who lives and works in Japan here. Pretty sure the falling fertility rate has less to do with soy and more to do with the fact that young people regularly work 12+ hour days with no overtime pay and that promotions are awarded based on seniority, meaning workers don’t have the time or financial stability to have children or even date. But yeah, tofu I guess. It’s probably that.</p>
