        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have never seen his show during it&#39;s air time, nor what would be considered a &quot;fan&quot; of Tucker Carlson, but I have watched a few of his segments on YouTube, including the recent ones about Syria. Certainly he was being more brave than any other talking head television pundit propagandist. </p>

<p>After Friday, he&#39;s now been off of his own show for three straight nights and nobody&#39;s talking about it or asking what&#39;s up. You remember when O&#39;Reilly and more recently Laura Ingraham went MIA, it was a big deal. Nothing for Tucker Carlson. </p>

<p>It&#39;s weird, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have access to it, re-watch his Monday show. Some other stuff on Tuesday, and similar content last week. If I had to guess, it seems that pressure has come on him to tone down the genuine skeptical journalism. He was asking hard questions and pointing out that the Syria stuff is nonsense and the establishment&#39;s push for war is ill-advised. It seems that has maybe irked TPTB and he&#39;s been admonished for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>an update from the other thread.   In Minute 59 of Friday&#39;s show, Kilmeade said Tucker would be back on Monday from a vacation, but 7 seconds later, Kilmeade said about himself that, [quote] &quot;I&#39;ll be back on Fox And Friends unless I get suspended&quot; [end quote] -- seemingly hinting that Tucker&#39;s &quot;vacation&quot; that began mid-week Tuesday night may have actually been a suspension.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would figure the executives are more worried about litigation than anything. Even a pundit ‘entertainer’ can be held accountable for slander. People like Tucker act like journalists but they are just shilling for ratings. When they say stuff that is unverifiable or unsourced and act like they have ‘protection of the press’ to legitimize their opinion they are vulnerable to lawsuits. Just look at what is happening right now, people selling opinions as fact right now are being sued left and right, pun intended. </p>

The people he interviewed did not say anything to to support either version of events only that they helped hose off folks that could have been gassed.

    <div class="md"><p>Ehhh I don&#39;t know about that.</p>

<p>Even people that deny the weird things about 9/11 and sheepishly nod to the official narrative can have some great insights into other areas. Noam Chomsky is a good example of that. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just that things like 9/11 and other similar events are usually too sensitive to talk about. Tucker or others that nod to the official explanations of these events without question may even have private misgivings about them, but they know that speaking about it on air would likely not be the best idea and could truly cost them their job, while having them labeled a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, a term brilliantly slided by the CIA that makes you seem like a fool for not bowing down to the government and media&#39;s official storyline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m just seeing too much evidence that this syria attack was a false flag. And when there’s too much evidence, and very convenient evidence at that it makes me start to wonder. That interview on sky news cut short etc. No admiral would voice his own opinion when given the government view on the situation. Small children conveniently filmed saying there was no attack.  I’ve seen the speed the MOD can take down an unwanted photo off social media. Trust me it’s quick and it’s decisive, yet here we are with streams of videos about false attacks etc. </p>

<p>And since being in the uk I don’t know Tucker Carlson. But would he have voiced his opinion without his bosses approval ? And would they have so obviously taken him off air ?  It’s screaming a psy op of sorts. A week ago people on the street were talking about the real possibility of nuclear war, now in RT some Russian ambassador has said there’s 100% chance nuclear war wouldn’t happen and little Kim has decided to not proceed any further with his Nuke plan.  I mean WTF ??  It’s like dating a bipolar person one minute you are fighting next minute it’s as calm as a spring morning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible Carlson is totally playing puppet, but I don&#39;t want to believe that. As I mentioned elsewhere, he&#39;s been totally on board with &quot;Oswald acted alone&quot; and &quot;The 9/11 Official Story looks good to me.&quot; </p>

<p>But he may also have enough freedom and leeway to get off a couple shows before management puts the hammer down, if he really does doubt the Syria story. As a BUSINESS decision, Carlson is doing his job--replacing Bill O&#39;Reilly with decent ratings, enough to continue to win that time slot among all the 24 hour news networks, even if they aren&#39;t as high as O&#39;Reilly&#39;s in his prime. </p>

<p>I do notice the whiplash back and forth to drive Americans to hyperactive levels of anxiety, then reduce, and there certainly could be motivation behind that. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all half lies, at least, all the time. </p>

<p>Basically Cenk Uyger agreeing with Tucker Carlson. If people are watching Tucker on the right and watching Cenk on the left, word is definitely getting around.
