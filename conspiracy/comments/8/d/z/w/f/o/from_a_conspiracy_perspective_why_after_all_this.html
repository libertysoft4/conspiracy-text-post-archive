    <div class="md"><p>One perspective I&#39;ve seen on this is that DPRK is a Chinese client state, and so when you hear that North Korea is doing such and such, missile tests or whatever, that&#39;s really China making aggressive moves toward America using DPRK as a proxy. </p>

<p>The other version I&#39;ve heard is that the CIA or some other &#39;Deep State&#39; agency has been secretly running DPRK for decades. If their position has changed, it could be that CIA has ceased whatever they were doing over there. Some of the speculation has been genetic engineering, cloning, organ harvesting etc. I don&#39;t know how to substantiate those claims. It is possible that Trump and Pompeo have stopped what was going on and so that&#39;s why things are suddenly different. It was publicly announced that Pompeo made a recent trip there, so it seems like more than a coincidence. </p>

<p>So short answer... we don&#39;t have enough information to know for sure, but it seems that one of these is likely to be true: that the administration&#39;s posture toward China has pushed the Chinese to get the North Korean leadership to take a friendlier posture, or there was some kind of top secret operation going on over there that has now ended. Both possibilities are good, and I hope it&#39;s the second that turns out to be true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I was gonna say I doubt they&#39;d do genetic engineering there, they&#39;d just contract some company that&#39;s owned by the deep state. But it makes sense that that&#39;s where the weapons we sell to other countries come from. Because they cant make them in the US or any first world country because it would be difficult to make thousands of guns and rockets and shit disappear, so they make it in NK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This.</p>

<p>Plus I think Trump is better are broking deals than the previous set of Politicians because he is a businessman.</p>

<p>During the early days of his campaign he mentioned that Obama et al made a deal with Iran to stop nuclear weapons production in return for lifted sanctions and more money. Trump asked &quot;why didn&#39;t they add NK into the negotiations? NK won&#39;t listen to America, but they will listen to Iran&quot;</p>

<p>A simple yet genius question. Use a country that is on your side to apply pressure to a country who isn&#39;t on your side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody wanted to believe the wall was going to be built, I think it was an empty campaign promise like so many politicians make. </p>

<p>4D chess/checkers/battleships/Spirograph : Trump is waiting for the new Mexican administration to get in so they can carve out a new deal. I don&#39;t know how true it is, but I did see something on the internet (so probably not true at all) that implied that the Mexicans would be happier if the drug cartels had a harder time getting their shit into the states and that the perception of added security would bring in more tourists. SO mexico are in favour of the wall</p>

<p>Most campaign promises are empty lies and anybody who doesn&#39;t see that is at best naïve.</p>

<p>If you couldn&#39;t tell by the 5D chess/ SPIROGRAPH opening to the second paragraph, it was mainly meant as tongue-in-cheek, poking fun at those who do the mental gymnastics with anything to prove a point to themselves. This could be phones, cars, politics or games consoles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In addition to some of the other points presented:</p>

<p>Bill&#39;s Appeasement gave Il everything he needed to build the bombs.
Bush&#39;s punishment of forced isolation gave him every reason to seek any path to gain attention.
Obama&#39;s display against Lybia and Syria proved the US only cares about Regime change no matter what NK does.</p>

<p>But Trump isn&#39;t giving Un anything, even when they comply. He is threatening force in response to threats but is still giving NK attention and not pretending they don&#39;t exist. And he has shown with Syria that he has no interest in Regime change so dealing with him isn&#39;t a death sentence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really do think trump is doing a great job! So many haters just because the man uses his power and not being a pu**y acting like &quot;politiclly correct&quot;. the evidence is here! the man who &quot;Will destroy america &quot; just did one of the greatest accomplishments of the last century!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surprised no-ones mentioned Russia has ties to Trump and North Korea both, economically speaking for sure. If not as power partners. Russia wants us out of syria so they control the damascus pipeline via Assad, Trump says we&#39;re pulling out. No sanctions on Russia. North Korea has long been Russian influenced and they have worked in partnership. Yes China too obviously but you can&#39;t overlook their other neighbors. I&#39;m guessing Russia and US via SK proxy are negotiating the trade and mining to get all of the valuable stuff out from under NK&#39;s mountain and saying Kim will get the lion&#39;s share (Haha fat chance). </p>

<p>On the other hand, maybe it was just Jong Un&#39;s wife liking the international spotlight and she&#39;s pulling strings in the bedroom. Cities have fallen for less.</p>

<p>You may disagree, but I thought that first angle should at least be considered/mentioned. Feel free to tell me why you think such a partnership is improbable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NK has been able to extract concessions out of previous administrations. Perhaps he realized that with all the bluster coming from Trump, no concessions would be forthcoming from his, so it&#39;s time to play ball for a bit--at least until a more amenable administration is in charge. </p>

These people in both countries are Korean they want to be reunified with their families. Trump has done nothing but act dramatic while building tensions, it’s Moon Jae-In and the Korean people that are the real game changers in this situation. </p>
