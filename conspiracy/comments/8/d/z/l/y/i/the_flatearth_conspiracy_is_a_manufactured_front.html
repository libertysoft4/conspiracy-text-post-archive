<p>Like take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcFLmM9tFIc&amp;amp;t=1s">this video</a> as an example, I understand this is partly a meme, but it&#39;s so similar to legit flat earth videos, its basically mocking people who might doubt Nasa or  SpaceX and automatically equates them as flat earth believers. </p>

<p>Wake up people!</p>

As a child, Antarctica as a land mass never made sense. </p>

<p>Round or flat, I believe we have our own little world and there are other worlds beyond the bounds  of the rings encasing. And that would explain UFO&#39;s. Especially the controversial theory that CIA ops leaked that a species of alien looks just like us and can interbreed with us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s absolutely a possibility and a potential answer to the most-asked question about flat earth: &quot;Why would they lie? Why would TPTB conspire to fake the size and/or shape of the earth.&quot; They could be hiding areas twice or more the size of our known Earth, full of resources and even an elite breakaway civilization complete with the slaves of our untold hundreds of thousands of missing and kidnapped people. That of course would raise questions about cellestial objects and how they&#39;d appear over our portion of the Earth (projections, sun simulators?). Earth could be round, but with no measured curvature, it must be many magnitudes of times bigger than they say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it works well to make a stink around anyone doubting foundational science or facts taken to be known due to foundational science.  The fraud and fakery you point out is part of it, 
...but, <em>finishes large bowl of mushrooms</em>, maybe another part is fraudulence and secrecy about physical theory itself.  The formalism of special relativity initially had roughly two hotly debated interpretations (two types of interpretations).  Einstein&#39;s approach supposed the &#39;least machinery&#39; and did not need to suppose that certain &#39;ether-frame&#39; exists.  With the &#39;principle of relativity&#39; that states &#39;physical laws must the same for all observers, (this includes EM laws that require speed of light to be c)&#39;, which should not at this point in reasoning be automatically thought of as &#39;deep&#39; but importantly as an arbitrary addition, &#39;ad hoc&#39;.&#39;  The supposition of &#39;same for all observers&#39; could, logically speaking, NOT be true.  It is not absurd to suppose, at this point in the historical debate, that outside of the causal chain of events we can&#39;t possible register/measure that there is a reason for them to change.  The principle of relativity cannot be justified a priori.  The second approach that was rejected is usually named after Lorentz, the person who developed the mathematics of relativity (special relativity of course as well, as this only adds the &#39;ad hoc&#39; principle of relativity / &#39;same for all observers&#39;).  Lorentz relativity supposed what seems most obvious -- the constant speed of EM waves should be interpreted like the constant speed of many other kinds of waves, as to say it is a disturbance propagating through a medium.  This medium was called &#39;ether.&#39;  There are ways to model particles as a wave-phenomena within an ether.  These ways to model the particles require enormous computational power due to their lacking certain mathematical niceties that were of course embraced by the first modern physicists.  Our physics has been ontologically blinded by having to be formulated and defined within &#39;hand-calculable&#39; forms.  ... The strange particles, strong force theory, computers, and accelerators all came along in a short span of time.  At this stage the hand-math based theories were far and away the only reasonable choice, but the possibility of the computer-aided ether-based theory was acted upon as well.  A secret interpretation of physical data was thus born and has been kept and explored by CERN and associates.  The Higgs data might be fake.  The real mechanism of mass might have something to do with wave-dynamics and ether mechanics.  Maybe it implies something radical, like that the ether bits are seemingly engineered in some sense, and perhaps are the elements of a &#39;computer&#39; or &#39;mind&#39; of some sort that permits super-luminal causality to a limited extent.  Between the initial severance from EM-medium/ether theory and the CERN/strong force era, Dirac may have perhaps accidentally given the most blinding construction of all with the relativistic quantum wave equation of the electron.  He was amazing to find the equation, and its predictions do work, but with this amazing insight, theory seems to have fully walked into having no clear ontological status.  A superluminal dynamic with ontological real histories of a composite structure works yet flips many basic interpretations on their head.  Is LIGO measuring ether-friction, or GR waves? Did satellites explore super-luminal correlations or simple Bell inequality? Does the cosmic background radiation map show an artifact of Earth&#39;s fields or is this a wild statistical fluke?  I would not be surprised if many studies taken to bear upon general relativity have been faked in order to perpetuate the lie.  General relativity has serious problems in dark matter/energy.  The trust in the theory at very large scales in the face of mass/energy discrepancy is at best ad hoc, as it represents the only possible data we have for that scale, and it fails horribly.  </p>

<p>maybe there are many reasons to keep the CERN/fraud rolling. I wonder how many more kilometers of tunnel exist, for what purpose, to where?  We should be allowed to take tours.</p>

<p>The real mechanism of mass might have something to do with wave-dynamics and ether mechanics.

    <div class="md"><p>Troll you? No, I&#39;m not trolling you. God that term annoys me. I am just saying if the morons come up with shit that you find compelling, then they are either not morons or you are closer to the side of the morons than you&#39;d care to admit. Like a closet moron. </p>

<p>You have stated they look fake. Of course they do. Why would they look fake if they weren&#39;t? Ok. So let&#39;s just imagine they are fake. why are they fake? If people start putting things together and connecting shit, they&#39;ll inevitably come to some conclusions at some point. Sometimes its wrong, sometimes they get it right. </p>

<p>There&#39;s been plenty of legit people getting things wrong. Especially if their initial data or information is invalid. People should be free to try and find their own way or answers with out people calling them morons, especially when they don&#39;t trust the group at the circlejerk who came up with the shit that all the other shit is based on. </p>

<p>Not even about flat earth or any other conspiracy but just in general if we only trust the academic scientists to give us answers and we only trust the academic historian to tell us about the past or we only trust the relatively small number of people who actually make it to the end of the course. Then it would surely be easy to control those groups. Especially when most of them are to cowardly to speak up against bullshit in fear of being character assassinated and destroyed or it&#39;s so compartmentalized that most people that would know some shit actually don&#39;t know shit because they don&#39;t have the whole picture. </p>

<p>From someone who&#39;s up for any possible outcome about anything. Like I entertain as many scenarios as I can come up with. It looks more weird that there&#39;s far more people saying the same comment. &quot;it&#39;s a psy-op&quot; than there is actually flatearthers pushing theories. especially in this thread. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they are right about specific instances within their theory. Well you think they are right, as apposed to you think they are wrong. They&#39;ve gone wrong somewhere, sure. But it was based on truth that you agree with. NASA shit looks fake. </p>

<p>What about the people who can&#39;t afford a trip into the mountains but think NASA shit looks fake? Let&#39;s say NASA shit was fake, It looks fake because it is. What is your explanation as to why its fake? </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure their have been legit scientists who have found some truth, ran with it and tried to come up with some conclusions. Which may or may not turn out to be bollocks. </p>

<p>Haha, the funny thing is, this happens all the time. We believe something for 30 years and then the &quot;experts&quot; are like &quot;yeah, we got that wrong&quot; and y&#39;all just eat it up. </p>

<p>There&#39;s people who think its flat because they&#39;ve seen some shit on YouTube or whatever. Then the other, obviously more predominant group that think its spherical because they were told so in High school. Then there&#39;s a group that thinks it&#39;s a psy-op because their R/conspiracy buddies told them so. Then there&#39;s the people who actually know, for sure. 100% what is it. I&#39;m pretty confident you aren&#39;t in that group.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it again. The sheer amount of people saying pys-op and the level of &quot;Make these people look like idiots&quot; (especially when it makes it to UKs Big brother, even the layout of their lounge was in the flat earth model for fucks sakes!) Looks more weird than the people just trying to find some answers in this mad world. </p>

<p>That they dont understand density OR gravity. I can place dense metals on my wooden coffee table, and wouldnt expect to have them go through. Major lack of understanding the world they live in.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because 1.) they didnt put the ISS right in the middle of a bunch of other debris. 2.) They havent filled up our orbits.... kinda like how an asteroid belt is still very sparsely dense, nothing like what Star Wars would have you believe.</p>

<p>I actually work in the space industry, and have some understanding of the complexity of systems involved, tight margins, and huge backlog of undone work.  Most in the industry aren&#39;t even barely aware that people want to see a video of ISS going around the earth uninterrupted, let alone have the time to mess around with that bullshit.  The ISS cost hundreds of billions and there is very little time to get much done up there, including science and maintenance, so they must ruthlessly prioritize what they do.  Satisfying some schoolyard challenge posed by uneducated ignorants who don&#39;t care much about their work anyway is pretty damn low on the list.</p>

<p>Lol no not at all. There is plenty of evidence that space is real and we live on a globe. </p>

<p>Whenever I see this argument I get the feeling the poster doesnt know too much about cameras. </p>

<p>Fisheye is just wide angle. You would want wide angle to capture as much info as possible. </p>

<p>I can get you footage of curvature without a fish eye if you would like, youll ignore it but I can provide it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe We (Humans) made it to the moon, but i don&#39;t believe that any of them made it back in the 60&#39;s/70&#39;s. I think we got up there, be it American or Russians first and realised there was no way to get the crew back. So we took in as much information as possible, left them to die and replicated the landing back down on Earth. </p>

<p>It explains why the footage is easily picked apart due to wind and different lighting etc but it also covers NASA&#39;s arse. Ever notice how NASA doesn&#39;t dispute that we GOT TO THE MOON. They never really say if we succesfully made it back or not...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t think they are covering up having never been to space. But I do believe the whole Flat Earth thing is a manufactured campaign to discredit conspiracies relating to NASA and separately Antarctica. </p>

<p>There used to be a ton of conspiracy videos on both of these subjects available, then they all were either removed or buried so far that I can&#39;t find them anymore, in their place flat earth gibberish.</p>

<p>Then recently I noticed they started throwing conspiracies relating to Nuclear bombs into the Flat Earth Machine. There&#39;s a theory (not saying I believe it) that nuclear bombs aren&#39;t as powerful as we&#39;ve been told. Yet, for some reason I can only find videos on it that are &quot;Flat Earth&quot; videos. I can&#39;t even put it together in my head how one has anything to do with the other. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just a label they assign to anything they don&#39;t want people looking into or they want you mocked and socially ostracized for looking into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earth is clearly just an effort to try to dissuade any criticism of NASA. The moon landings were clearly staged and faked and NASA has been caught altering photos for whatever reason. Kubrick was laughing about it in his films. If a person were to go up into the outer areas of space they would have been fried by radioactive sun storms bouncing off earths ionosphere. We were taught in school that our understanding of the universe was so great that their would be a moon colony by 2020 and mars would just be a leap ahead. Their only argument is that we needed to dream big believe all our scientific community tells us and give a lot more money to the so called underfunded space program while Tesla launches a car with a dummy into mars orbit for pure space theatrics!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not just space travel it’s because of other things as well. Some of which I have yet to see rational answers to.  Gyroscopes. Why do they not move on a rotating earth and how did they work in planes in the 30s let’s say with no gps ? </p>

<p>The mountain experiment is very interesting and needs an explanation </p>

<p>Satellites I’m just not sure. But I do find it interesting as to why do many antennae are popping up everywhere in the uk. </p>

<p>Moon landings ?  You’d have to be an idiot to still believe those happened. Footprints on dust with no water indeed ? And that footage of the astronauts faking the earth photos ? That is just amazing how it’s not considered a slam dunk apart from many many many other things wrong with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer your first point :</p>

<p>Gyroscopes don&#39;t need GPS to work. All the gyroscope is doing is keeping the 3 axis X,Y and Z in the same &#39;level&#39; to give the instruments they accurate readings they require while your plane is doing loop-de-loops. </p>

<p>Gyroscopes do move on a rotating Earth. In fact, some planes that are using mechanical gyroscopes (not laser or fibre optic) have a precession to them and require resetting every so often (approx. 20 minutes from what I&#39;ve done in the past). This is because the &#39;point&#39; where the gyroscope started is now behind you. IIRC anyway</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your wrong about the resetting of gyroscopes every 20 minutes. How does the plane know which way round the earth it’s flying ? It’s entirely possible the plane could be stationary in space yet be traveling at 500 miles an hour around the earth.  </p>

<p>And no thy don’t show any movement in the rotation of the earth when stationary. Least not from what I’ve seen.  </p>

<p>By the way that is one of three explanations I’ve heard. Including a gravity locator. And super scientific ones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstand the concept. A gyroscope &#39;locks&#39; into position when it&#39;s set. The &#39;reference point&#39; of which is the Earth when it&#39;s in a particular place in space and time. That space and time passes as the Earth rotates so the gyroscope is trying to stay locked into the position that you no longer occupy. If you stand still on Earth, the Earth is still moving and the gyroscope will still topple. At least that&#39;s how I&#39;ve had it explained to me. The 20 minutes example was from a particular mechanical gyroscope fitted to a particular type of aircraft. Of course, these were old fashioned and were replaced with fibre optic and laser gyroscopes.</p>

<p>The plane knows which way round the Earth it&#39;s flying due to many inputs going into (usually) the main computer. Pitot-static information, terrain following radar/Doppler instruments, altimeter, compass etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No sill doesn’t make sense. </p>

<p>You said the gyroscope adjusted every 20 minutes. That was quite clear. So just think of which way round the earth the plane moves. It’s in space the gyroscope aligns itself as you rightly know. But the plane could be at 90 degrees from its original position after four hours. Or it could in fact not have moved at all. </p>

<p>You have stated they look fake. Of course they do. Why would they look fake if they weren&#39;t? Ok. So let&#39;s just imagine they are fake. why are they fake? If people start putting things together and connecting shit, they&#39;ll inevitably come to some conclusions at some point. Sometimes its wrong, sometimes they get it right. </p>

<p>There&#39;s been plenty of legit people getting things wrong. Especially if their initial data or information is invalid.

<p>Not even about flat earth or any other conspiracy but just in general if we only trust the academic scientists to give us answers and we only trust the academic historian to tell us about the past or we only trust the relatively small number of people who actually make it to the end of the course. Then it would surely be easy to control those groups. Especially when most of them are to cowardly to speak up against bullshit in fear of being character assassinated and destroyed or it&#39;s so compartmentalized that most people that would know some shit actually don&#39;t know shit because they don&#39;t have the whole picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure you did, I can&#39;t watch this fake shit for more than 10 minutes straight, what is really annoying is that you&#39;re stuck with this pre-recorded broadcast, you can&#39;t rewind like you can with most live streams. I guess they really don&#39;t want people analyzing this bullshit. If it&#39;s 92 minutes it should be flying into the terminator line in roughly 46 minutes, however this stream never goes to the dark side.</p>

<p>How can you admit something that is a fact?</p>

<p>Easy you acknowledge the fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you explain to me why you think people use fish eye lenses?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To get a greater field of view, and to emphasize curvature when you want to fool people into thinking the earth is round. Particularly seeing as the space station is not a weather monitoring station and we have dedicated systems for those purposes.</p>
