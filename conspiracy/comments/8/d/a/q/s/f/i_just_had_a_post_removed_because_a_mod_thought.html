<h1>&quot;Moderators vs Editors&quot;</h1>

<p>Here is the thread.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8d4sw6/presstvisrael_has_secret_info_on_grahams/dxl9qzv/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8d4sw6/presstvisrael_has_secret_info_on_grahams/dxl9qzv/</a></p>

<p>Not sure how I feel about this.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>i had two sentences </p></li>
<li><p>my SS was actually &quot;upvoted&quot; (before the mod removed the post)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>so my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>w/ or w/o the SS, was the OP content worthy of <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> ?</p></li>
<li><p>was my SS &quot;partisan&quot; and &quot;garbage&quot; -- therefor, worthy of complete removal ??</p></li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE:  no disrespect to mods.  i realize i am (probably) risking my entire account by even &quot;questioning&quot; the actions of a mod.  but... i am sincerely concerned that mods are taking too much authority -- becoming &quot;editors&quot; (not just &quot;moderators&quot;)</p>

<p>yes, i disagree.  it&#39;s not &quot;partisan&quot; </p>

<p>last time i checked, partisan == DEM vs REPUB.</p>

<p>so no... my SS had nothing partisan about it.</p>

<p>ps.  even if i did post a &quot;partisan SS&quot; (more to the point): where does the rules say &quot;you may not post a partisan SS&quot; ?  i can&#39;t find it... maybe you can give me a link... ?</p>

<p>if anything, all i see is this detail re: SS:</p>

<p>With the SS system we should all be on high alert for censorship. There is a real danger of it because its another rule that can be abused.</p>

<p>Also, it shouldn&#39;t matter if the SS is partisan. This is your post and posters are sometimes partisan. Its also extremely hard to define what partisan means. It shouldn&#39;t be an obstacle to somebody posting.</p>

<p>maybe vague if one doesn&#39;t know what &quot;pizzagate&quot; is... but i don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonably for mods to expect that SS should further define &quot;terms&quot; that are used within the SS -- that&#39;s just ridiculous.</p>

<p>But still don&#39;t think it should be removed.</p>

<p>maybe if the post was about something obviously unrelated to &quot;conspiracies&quot;, but... come on!  the title starts with:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Israel using secret info on Sen. Graham...&quot;  (i.e., CLEARLY <a href="/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/</a> worthy)</li>
</ul>

<p>nope...  i did nothing wrong. there was nothing wrong with the SS.  the mod needs to un-remove it. </p>

<p>1) i didn&#39;t say that.  </p>

<p>not yet, but if they keep it up... reddit will go the way or digg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It already has gone the way of digg, only instead of the site itself filtering and curating the content, the power users and mods do that.</p>

<p>In terms of whether people will ever leave reddit for something better, it seems unlikely. Reddit has been around for a while now and there are plenty of people who’ve grown up using it, just like Facebook.</p>

<p>Maybe it will die a slow death as something else starts taking new users instead, but it seems unlikely for there to ever be a mass exodus as happened with digg. Each community is compartmentalized and there are plenty of subs who wouldn’t even care if reddit started censoring whatever topic, and reddit would remain the best place to discuss that interest.</p>

<p>No you didn&#39;t. You had two short bullet points, as a submission statement. I&#39;m 50/50 about SS&#39;s, but, I agree with the removal of it not being &quot;enough&quot;, however I disagree with the &quot;partisan&quot; part. Just my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funny thing is, I’m not a big fan of the submission statement at all.  I saw the original post and just ignored because of the lack of effort the OP put into it and the clear political hackery.  </p>

<p>With that said, by removing the post it has now drawn more attention than it ever deserved.  Thats the main reason why I disagree with the removal and the rule that allows mods to subjectively pick and choose.  </p>

<p>IMO it’s better to ignore these types of shit posts.  </p>
