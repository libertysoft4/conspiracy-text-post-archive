<p>We are not allowed, through either enforced ignorance or worse criminal prosecution to heal ourselves with plants that grow from the ground.</p>

<p>There are a few exceptions, for example, the Aloe Vera plant can be grown and slathered on your skin to soothe sunburns.</p>

<p>Examples of plants that are CONFIRMED to be of varying benefit to humans either physically or mentally yet will land you years in federal prison include</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Psilocybin (magic mushrooms)</p></li>
<li><p>Cannabis </p></li>
<li><p>Peyote</p></li>
<li><p>Kratom</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Think about it, we have been brainwashed into believing there are NO natural remedies, that if we want to feel better we need to pay for proprietary formulas that we dont understand.</p>

<p>Basically, if it isn&#39;t a pill, an ointment, or a medicinal syrup bought from an official pharmacy we simply refuse to believe it has anything to offer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we are encouraged to overdose on caffeine and sugar, to suck down nicotine to our heart&#39;s content and drink ourselves to death on alcohol.</p>

<p>It would be laughably simple to put together a comprehensive program mandatory for all youths that plainly explains the reality of a healthy diet and exercise routine while providing inexpensive healthy foods to the population while taxing cancer and obesity causing &quot;luxury foods&quot; to subsidize the lowering of cost on healthy foods.</p>

<p>No the food industry likes us as gluttons </p>

<p>which benefits the medical industry as the gluttony gives them dozens of widespread basically life long incurable diseases we must pay them to ease </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right... also speaking from experience. </p>

<p>I had the opportunity to attend private school from grades 3-6. I thrived and was given many top of the class awards. Before that, I was always in trouble for ADD behavior like bothering other kids. When I had to go back to public school, I found it a waste of time. I skipped class to smoke and go to movies downtown. Nobody cared then because I still got As, but I flunked out of university due to bad work ethic and attitude towards school.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to nourish your kid&#39;s interests, even if it&#39;s video games or makeup. Try to guide them in how to turn those interests into projects that give something to the community and the world. That perspective is the part kids need help with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention the most obvious.</p>

<p>Why are high schoolers not educated in filing taxes, seeking employment, filling out job applications, dynamics of credit and debit cards, how loans work, how to look into the viability of career choices, alternative options to college (ect, ect, ect)</p>

<p>There are things that could be done to DIRECTLY increase a childs likelihood of success but instead they are forced to take more and more &quot;high brow&quot; book smarts classes, not that those arent important but 50% - 75% of students will not put those classes to use, whereas the subjects I listed could help even a harvard student.</p>

<p>Not to mention of course I believe there should be a class focused on educating people about natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals and when it becomes  actually neccessary to try those pharmaceuticals</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By Light preacher I mean a typical &quot;guru&quot; who promotes the idea of Light defeating the dark. In spiritual terms it could also be understood as &quot;getting rid of&quot; the Ego. 
Hm I am not great at expressing this, so if I am not making myself clear, feel free to ask more questions! </p>

<p>To illustrate the Picture. Light can be seen as Positive and dark as Negative. In a painting you can only ever draw Dark if you have a White contrast and vice versa. Even if what you only ever want is White (Light) there has to be Black (dark) to illuminate. By trying to get rid of the Black (dark) the chase begins and one becomes trapped again. It is a game after all that alot of humans want to play, which is fine. Still there are humans who are tired of that game and wants something else, these people usually turn to spiritual teachers, and some spiritual teachers use this opportunity to play the Light vs Dark game again. What I mean by Light preachers is basically someone who sees Light and Dark as forces that is trying to &quot;win&quot; over the other, trying to defeat the other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can always find a good clinical psychologist but they aren&#39;t very likely to prescribe anything in the way of drugs. </p>

<p>In fact they very much oppose psychiatrists who almost always do prescribe something to alter your brain chemistry in order to deal with whatever your problems or symptoms appear to be. </p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s no proof and no way to test that there&#39;s actually anything wrong with your brain chemistry that may lead you to have those problems or symptoms, however, or that what they&#39;re actually prescribing to suppress or stop them will ever do anything more than that, rather than ever cure them, so you have to keep on taking it, or something else like it to avoid becoming addicted, which is not a particularly good way to deal with them in the long run.</p>

<p>Psychologists, on the other hand exist to help you identify and unravel any mental or emotional problems that are almost always the result of untoward events and experiences in your past that have upset and caused you to think and react in certain ways that have eventually evolved to the point where they&#39;re interfering with your life and that of others around you and getting in the way of what you actually want to do and should be able to do but find that you somehow can&#39;t. </p>

<p>Psychologists train to recognise the nature of those mental and emotional hang-ups and to get their subjects to recognise and come to grips with them in a gradual and positive way in order to overcome them and get their lives back on track. </p>

<p>Not sure what your interest in psychedelics is based on or if you yourself have a particular problem that others have clamed to derive some benefit from using them, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend that anyone go that route without trying to resolve whatever it is with the help of a clinical psychologist first and without experimenting with their own psyche in a way that may profoundly effect them without knowing beforehand if that would actually be a good thing or not for the kind of person that they happen to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, this reads as very sound, level-headed advice which I appreciate. I guess my interest in psychedelics in this regard is that I&#39;ve heard it can almost act as a shortcut to the long, expensive process of cognitive therapy. But then I worry it might just be a shortcut to psychosis if not done properly in a medical context. I think it&#39;s obvious that talking-therapy with a clinical psychologist is the most logical way to go but opening up to someone feels like the last thing I want to do (equally a distrust in psychiatric medicine). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid that there&#39;s plenty to distrust when it comes to psychiatry, as is evidenced by the more than 10 million children and adolescents currently being prescribed psycho-active drugs to presumably control and prevent their so-called social and behavioral shortcomings.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also been a lot of deeply disturbing incidents involving some of them that has resulted in some sudden and completely unexpected outbursts of a violent, murderous, and suicidal nature while taking those drugs that I&#39;m far less inclined to consider as being as &quot;coincidental&quot; as the psychiatrists and medical establishment are in order to keep right on prescribing those meds.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an old saying that anything worthwhile takes time to accomplish, and another old cliché that a journey of thousand miles always begins with just one step. </p>

<p>Jordan Peterson, a remarkably good clinical psychologist and professor of psychology who&#39;s gotten a lot of press both positive and negative due to people trying to make political hay out of his psychological assessments of the kind of subtle and even overt &quot;mind manipulation&quot; he sees going on in both our universities and society at large has a fair number of his lectures and seminars on You-Tube that I think you&#39;d find more than worthwhile in perusing simply for the information he provides on the fundamentals of human psychology and how it works. </p>

<p>Sort of a risk free way to familiarize yourself with it and then perhaps take the next step towards finding a clinical psychologist to help you explore and better understand your own personal psychology in relation to what you see as being a problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, look at it this way. Older generations were much less likely to get sick than us and had very little use of pharmaceuticals. They tried healing themselves with natural resources. Plants, leafs, tea. My grandmother still does this, because she still lives in her native village and is growing her own food(vegetables, fruit e.t.c). If she gets a head-ache, she doesn&#39;t take pills(Panadol), she makes a drink from some leaf/tea and she instantly gets better.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s really the same as weed. Natural sources/plants have amazing abilities to heal us. But if that was happening, just imagine how many BILLIONS of dollars the pharmaceutical companies would loose. Same reason weed is being attacked so much. </p>

<p>&quot;Meaning and existence, pattern and colour become more significant than spatial relationships and time. Duration is replaced by a perpetual present.&quot; -Aldous Huxley</p>

<p>&quot;So the secret of waking up from the drama, the endless cycles, is the realization that the only time that there is is the present. There&#39;s no time, only an eternal now.&quot; -Alan Watts</p>

He thinks I&#39;m gullible and all the alternative treatments are only trying to take advantage of sick people. I&#39;m too chicken shit to live with the guilt of being more aggressive at questioning his decisions.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, another commenter showed that Aloe is actually a conspiracy and is ineffective.</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t really believe it considering the walls of products that claim to contain Aloe as an argument for their usefulness.</p>

<p>And besides that the only ones left around legally have likely been genetically neutered of their original abilities and provide equal or worse benefits than a low strength aspirin.</p>

<p>Anything above that power is unattainable for us. I imagine we dont know and would not be able to find info on many ancient plants of proven benefit as they have been intentionally pushed into extinction (if we&#39;re lucky their are seeds in some vault somewhere) by profit hungry corporations.</p>

<p>And besides that it could just be the typical needle in a haystack technique, maybe some plants that are relatively common have amazing properties if utilized in a specific way but all the techniques and knowledge on the topic is suppressed </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sad to say it goes much deeper than this, plant knowledge is apart of ancient knowledge which is being wiped out. Just as the ancient scrolls have most all been destroyed and burned (or hidden in the Vatican) throughout the world. Indigenous people are also being wiped out, we&#39;ve destroyed Native culture as well as decimated their populations. This goes back even further with Spain conquest of Mexico. These populations have also been killed off in a more recent Guatemalan genocide of indigenous people who carried plant and spiritual knowledge (the aggressors were armed by Israel who is also apart of the quest to eliminate ancient cultures which hold information detrimental to banks and their institutions).</p>

<p>What can we do? Well we are doing it, learn about ancient cultures and ancient medicines and make them MODERN medicines by consuming them and saying fuck you to pharmaceuticals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just ignorance about the wonderful healing properties of plants, but also ignorance about how to prepare these plants.</p>

<p>I think it goes without saying that the plant kingdom is our medicine chest (or poison). Every culture on earth has a tradition of using plants to keep us healthy and alive. 
But how do we prepare them so that we can actually take into our bodies all of the beneficial compounds? The human digestive system is not always up to the task of breaking down plant fibers. All of these compounds are essentially locked up within the body of the plant. How can we release them?</p>

<p>Most people would make a tea out of the herb. The problem with this is that many of the compounds within plants (i.e. essential oils) are not water soluble. So, no matter how long you let it steep, only water soluble compounds will dissolve into the solution.</p>

<p>The next best thing is to make a tincture. This is the same thing as making tea, except a solution of ethanol (grape alcohol) and water is used. The alcohol has an affinity for all the compounds hidden inside the plant material and pulls it out. Then it&#39;s strained to get rid of the plant material and you now have a tincture containing all the compounds that had been locked up in the plant. Many people think this is the most potent form of herbal medicine, however there is more...</p>

<p>The mineral salts! Instead of throwing out the plant material it&#39;s incinerated to white ash, washed with distilled water, filtered then the water evaporated away. 
Pure, white crystals form. The are the water soluble mineral salts the of plant. They are purified by repeating the process. Each time, the salt becomes whiter. A pound of plant material produces about a teaspoon of salts.</p>

<p>So. Why are these mineral salts so important? Well, first off, you want to get the whole plant. The salts are alkaline. When they are added back into the tincture it raises the PH level and converts the oily compounds into water soluble compounds. </p>

<p>So adding back the mineral salts is the missing key. It truly makes the extraction complete. The result is called a &quot;Spagyric&quot;. This process was written down by the famous Paracelsus in the 16th century but somehow we forgot all about it!</p>

<p>I first learned about this method when I began my study in Alchemy. There is more. Much, more. </p>

<p>Anyone else interested in this stuff?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  Most people get concerned any time you mention lye.  The thing is there are only so many salts because you are using the limited salts from the very plant itself.  I believe (but haven&#39;t tested it yet) that by the time all of the oily compounds have saponified the alkalinity is all used up.  It&#39;s a beautiful concept.</p>

<p>There is a definite and immediate reaction when the salts are added back to the tincture.  It darkens and takes on a faint, almost &quot;inky&quot; scent.  Turmeric turns from yellow into the most beautiful spectrum of red to orange to yellow to green.</p>

<p>One day I did an experiment thus.  Having a tincture of cannabis I took a teaspoon and poured it onto a plate to evaporate.  I then added the salts of the cannabis to the tincture (making the Spagyric) and did the same thing pouring a little onto a plate for evaporation.  After both were dry of alcohol such that there was only a residue left behind, I poured distilled water on top.  The Spagyric residue immediately washed away, while the oily tincture wouldn&#39;t budge no matter how long it soaked (because it&#39;s oily).</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious what this means for increasing our body&#39;s ability to absorb these saponified compounds.  It makes so much sense!  How could we have forgotten this?  I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s no accident.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s my goal to help to re-introduce this knowledge to the world at a time when we need it the most.  </p>

<p>There are actually even more powerful extracts that can be made, however they are made in private and are only administered to those who created them.</p>

<p>The most powerful plant extract is called a &quot;Plant Stone&quot;. It is the same thing as the philosopher&#39;s stone, but for the plant kingdom. With a plant stone, you could take any other plant, chop it all, put it in a jar, cover it with water and toss the plant stone into it. Within 15 minutes the plant stone will penetrate the plant and extract the &quot;quintessence&quot; of the plant which will float on top. The stone will be unchanged. The plant stone is literally a KEY to the plant kingdom.</p>

<p>This is the book I started with.  Alchemy is one hell of a Rabbit hole!  The &quot;Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy&quot;  By Junius.  Translated from Italian (I believe).</p>

I agree with your sentiments for the most part, but you would have a stronger argument if you also provided examples that are not psychoactive drugs used recreationally.

    <div class="md"><p>Look I understand where you’re coming from but those are all drugs and no matter how you try to swing it they are drugs. Drugs are illegal for a reason. Do I agree with that not always. If they were legal a lot of problems they cause wouldn’t be as bad. But as it is right now there is violence and crime surrounding drugs. It’s not some grand conspiracy drugs are illegal. They are illegal in almost every other country too. While they may offer benefits for s small group of people let’s be real here. Most people aren’t smoking weed for the “medical benefits” most people are smoking weed to get high. Sure you can throw some bs in there like it’s for my anxiety or my depression but I can tell you right now yea in the moment it makes you think it’s cures those things BECAUSE YOURE FUCKING HIGH but the moment you come down the depression comes back and even more so if used consistently because your brain sees all this excess dopamine being released so it cuts back on producing it’s own dopamine therefore making one more depressed when not high. </p>

<p>Ya wanna know what a crime against humanity is? Getting addicted to drugs. Getting so low in life that you rob other people, steal from people you love, sell everything you have to get high one more time. End up homeless and hungry begging for cash. And by that time you’re so addicted instead of using that cash for food it goes to more drugs. </p>

<p>Look I get it I used to love all drugs and thought the government was just trying to keep me down man they don’t want us to have free thought they want us to buy their drugs man weed will kill the paper industry man oh man look at all these people being helped by drugs it’s medical man. But then I found more and more and more drugs and soon enough I was addicted to possibly one of the worst and most addictive/ destructive drugs. I saw people turn into monsters. I saw people overdose and die left and right. So where do you draw the line? When do the nagatives outweigh the medical value? Which drugs should be legal and which ones should stay legal when even ones such as ketamine can cause overdoses? The line is too hard to draw. Sure weed go for it I’m even a fan of mushrooms and lsd but there Will always be a push for me. Casual users don’t understand they don’t see the dark side of drugs. The violence, the depravity, the insanity. I firmly believe drugs cause most of the crime committed today. People rob stores usually because they need drug money. Many murders are drug related. I get it drugs are fun but go see the dark side of drugs. Look into an opinion that isn’t the same as yours. Do real research that doesn’t just back up what you believe. I was like this once. Thinking drugs were amazing with no faults. But it’s not the case. I would look up stuff about drugs but Only read it if it aggreed with my beliefs. That’s not the truth though. The truth about drugs is darker than most will ever know </p>

<p>Ya wanna know what a crime against humanity is? Getting addicted to drugs. Getting so low in life that you rob other people, steal from people you love, sell everything you have to get high one more time. End up homeless and hungry begging for cash. And by that time you’re so addicted instead of using that cash for food it goes to more drugs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is insultingly inaccurate about every <strong>PLANT</strong> listed. Cannabis is the only one that a person would even choose to use regularly, and its proven to be less addictive than Cigarettes or alcohol and a have less negative long term side effects.</p>

<p>The rest of the plants are typically 1 time uses or a few times a year.</p>

<p>I feel like your projecting a reality more in line with Heroin, Meth, Cocaine, Ecstasy, and Pills. and upon going back found this quote</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But then I found more and more and more drugs and soon enough I was addicted to possibly one of the worst and most addictive/ destructive drugs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well duh, this isnt a fucking drug support post, and you are 100% making it out like everyone else is like you. Many, Many, Many peopple will stick to weed and weed only for their entire life, and not have to deal with lung cancer like cigarettes would give. Many people will meditate on it and allow it to facilitate deeper thought</p>

<p>Its clear that TO YOU drugs were about getting fucked up, you never drew a line between whats a natural and acceptable drug, and whats a chemical that will destroy you, and likely didnt consider moderating your intake to control tolerance either.</p>

<p>And that lead to you taking an unnatural, self destructive substance and getting wrapped up in the criminal underbelly that goes along with those substances.</p>

<p>Completely incomparable to some stoners hanging out on the couch watching cartoons a couple times a week.</p>

<p>And incomparable to some Psychonauts trying to look deeper into their own consciousness once every 6 months</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you believe addiction is a choice or a moral failing but it’s actually a disease.</p>

<p>I mainly smoked weed/ did halucigens for 5 years. Hallucinogens every few months but weed every day. Sure you can say I chose to do hard drugs but it’s not that simple when you’re an addict. I was put in a situation with people using drugs that I initially said no too but was eventually coerced. It’s not as black and white as you make it out to be. To an addict it’s I’ll just try this once it won’t be a problem. You don’t understand nor will you ever understand what it is like. The point I was making is it’s hard to draw a line. What makes a horse tranquilizer ok? And how can you say people won’t abuse it because they do. </p>

<p>Also you should look into some of the research of he long term effects of marijuana. It causes memory problems, increased anxiety, depression, and even schizophrenia. Look I love weed I’m all for it’s legalization but we need to be realistic about it. It’s not a miracle plant it has downsides just like every other drug.  Just like hallucinogens I’m all for them being legal but again we need to be realistic. In some people they cause major mental health problems inducing psychosis and schizophrenia. </p>

<p>I didn’t just start smoking weed like a crazy person. I did it just like you said. On weekends with my friends playing video games and just having fun. I didn’t choose to be an addict. Please learn more about it because the way you are talking about it is demeaning and hurtful </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look I get it I love weed too but that’s just not true. I. Some people it causes issues. Yes it feels awesome but it’s not always healing. And cbd stands for cannabinoid so I’m not sure you know what you are talking about. You ever smoke with someone that gets really paranoid? Thats not particularly healing for them. I’m not hating on weed but a lot of weed smokers ignore the facts about it. I was one of them defending it endlessly just like you are now. It’s not perfect it’s not a cure all. It is a drug and drugs have positives and negatives. </p>

<p>I’m men it can cause weaker sperm, with woman it’s even worse because their eggs are protected by a layer of fat in which the thc gets stored. This can impact the eggs. It also does the same in the fatty tissue in the brain which is why people who smoke a lot tend to think slower and have that typical stoner demeaner portrayed in movies and on tv. This is why stoners forget stuff a lot or why they don’t seem to process what people say sometimes. </p>

<p>Again I was a stoner for s very long time. I still want to smoke weed it feels awesome it seems to open your mind to new ways of thinking it feels creatively freeing I seemed to appreciate everything in the world so much more. Yes I think it is the best drug there is maybe tied with hallucinogens as far as mental health and overall affect it has on someone. But it isn’t perfect and never will be. And there’s the common misconception that for some reason it isn’t harmful to inhale and that’s just plain wrong.  It produces tar and has carcinogens in it. I still love it though. But as an addict I cannot smoke it anymore sadly </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am being realistic.</p>

<p>This attitude towards addiction I think is more harmful overall. If people think they are slaves to a chemical, they might as well be.</p>

<p>If they choose to rise above it through will power that path IS possible.</p>

<p>Most people dont have the sheer willpower required  to take that path I suppose, but that doesnt mean it isnt the best path, and teaching people they are helpless against addiction without therapy and other &quot;approved&quot; drugs is teaching them to be helpless and not take responsibility for bad decisions.</p>

<p>Look at it like this.</p>

<p>If you take a prized possession down to a pawn shop, you arent being mind controlled you are making a bad decision out of fear of withdrawal and desire for high. </p>

<p>I think were both right, I come from afamily of addicts so i am a bit more cynical.</p>

<p>I think its partially what you say, addiction being a beast of its own, but willpower cannot be discounted</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot understand addiction without actually going through it. Willpower is not enough. No part of recovery says you must take meds. Recovery usually consists of working a 12 step program. Drugs highjack the reward system in your brain. It gets straight down into the most ancient parts of our brain that tell us what we need for survival. When we eat that part of our brain tells the other parts to release chemicals such as dopamine to tell us this is good keep doing this we need this to survive. Same with sex and anything that make you feel good that is what is happening. Drugs release these same chemicals however in massive amounts the brain would never normally release. So the rest of the brain makes the connection saying this is pivotal in survival. It puts using drugs at priority number one for survival. Now obviously we can think through this and know they do not equal survival but that is how it feels. Going even a day without drugs to an addict feels indescribably horrible. </p>

<p>On top of this the brain has a thing called a hedonic set point. That means that there’s a certain level of brain chemicals that need to be released for it to register. Now when the brain is constantly flooded with chemicals from drugs it attempts to restore balance. It does this by raising the hedonic set point so it takes more chemicals to elicit a response. This is what is known as a tolerance. This also means that normal thing such as sex and eating will not register once the set point is high enough. This is why many addicts lose weight and stop doing anything beneficial because they get nothing out of it. There is no drive to do anything anymore besides drugs because they are the only thing that feels good. </p>

<p>This isn’t just hard drugs either. This all happened to me from daily marijuana use. I pawned my video games, my most prized possessions at the time to buy fucking weed. Not because of withdrawal or lack of willpower but because internally I was in hell. The depression and anxiety and overall feeling of dread I experienced back then was as I said something only an addict can understand. And honesty the part I find weird is that I was more emotionally distraught when all I did was weed than later in my using when I actually  was addicted to hard drugs that induced withdrawal. </p>

<p>Addiction is a disease. It’s not a choice. Addicts make the same choice to use drugs just like any other person. Supposedly the phenomenon of craving is what separates us. When an addict uses something happens that just makes them want more. No amount of any drug will satisfy the craving. An example is with alcoholics, when normal people have a couple drinks they get tired and don’t like feeling out of control so they stop. When an alcoholic takes the same drinks they feel like they are just getting started. This is why many alcoholics drink until they puke and pass out. Their body gives up before their brain is satisfied. </p>

<p>Addiction is so complicated not everything is known about it to this day. However it is accepted as a disease by all medical associations at least in the United States . And I’m passionate about this because obviously I am an addict and also because there is so much misconception and stigma attached to it. People say it’s a choice we just don’t have willpower and they just adds to the shame that we already carry with us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a feeling either Trump or his opponent will use federal legalization to swing the youth vote their way. </p>

<p>But really their just giving back what should never have been taken.</p>

<p>Its like imagine a parent (government) has 2 kids (drugs) and one kid consistently gets As and Bs in school (weedis shown to have little to no negative effects) and the other kid either gets an A or C and sometimes a hard F (Opiates can be perfectly helpful, but can also kill you and have many negative effects)</p>

<p>And the parent decides to continually punish the A and B kid and always demand evidence he didnt cheat and say he isnt smart(safe) unless he gets all A+. </p>

<p>While at the same time giving the other kid with much more erratic grades love and affection and telling him he will always love him just the way he is no matter what his grades (how many people opiates kill)</p>

<p>And after years of this the A and B kid starts petitioning distant relatives to let him move in with them (state legalization) and gets positive responses from almost all the relatives (30+ states have legalized in some way) and the parent starts to huff and puff and backtrack and eventually says fine Ill treat you the way you always deserved to be treated.</p>

<p>This is basically the drug war, and that parent deserves to be thrown in jail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  Most people get concerned any time you mention lye.  The thing is there are only so many salts because you are using the limited salts from the very plant itself.  I believe (but haven&#39;t tested it yet) that by the time all of the oily compounds have saponified the alkalinity is all used up.  It&#39;s a beautiful concept.</p>

<p>There is a definite and immediate reaction when the salts are added back to the tincture.  It darkens and takes on a faint, almost &quot;inky&quot; scent.  Turmeric turns from yellow into the most beautiful spectrum of red to orange to yellow to green.</p>

<p>One day I did an experiment thus.  Having a tincture of cannabis I took a teaspoon and poured it onto a plate to evaporate.  I then added the salts of the cannabis to the tincture (making the Spagyric) and did the same thing pouring a little onto a plate for evaporation.  After both were dry of alcohol such that there was only a residue left behind, I poured distilled water on top.  The Spagyric residue immediately washed away, while the oily tincture wouldn&#39;t budge no matter how long it soaked (because it&#39;s oily).</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious what this means for increasing our body&#39;s ability to absorb these saponified compounds.  It makes so much sense!  How could we have forgotten this?  I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s no accident.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s my goal to help to re-introduce this knowledge to the world at a time when we need it the most.  </p>

<p>There are actually even more powerful extracts that can be made, however they are made in private and are only administered to those who created them.</p>

<p>The most powerful plant extract is called a &quot;Plant Stone&quot;. It is the same thing as the philosopher&#39;s stone, but for the plant kingdom. With a plant stone, you could take any other plant, chop it all, put it in a jar, cover it with water and toss the plant stone into it. Within 15 minutes the plant stone will penetrate the plant and extract the &quot;quintessence&quot; of the plant which will float on top. The stone will be unchanged. The plant stone is literally a KEY to the plant kingdom.</p>

<p>This is the book I started with.  Alchemy is one hell of a Rabbit hole!  The &quot;Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy&quot;  By Junius.  Translated from Italian (I believe).</p>

So the rest of the brain makes the connection saying this is pivotal in survival. It puts using drugs at priority number one for survival. Now obviously we can think through this and know they do not equal survival but that is how it feels. Going even a day without drugs to an addict feels indescribably horrible. </p>

<p>On top of this the brain has a thing called a hedonic set point. That means that there’s a certain level of brain chemicals that need to be released for it to register. Now when the brain is constantly flooded with chemicals from drugs it attempts to restore balance. It does this by raising the hedonic set point so it takes more chemicals to elicit a response. This is what is known as a tolerance. This also means that normal thing such as sex and eating will not register once the set point is high enough. This is why many addicts lose weight and stop doing anything beneficial because they get nothing out of it. There is no drive to do anything anymore besides drugs because they are the only thing that feels good. </p>

<p>This isn’t just hard drugs either. This all happened to me from daily marijuana use. I pawned my video games, my most prized possessions at the time to buy fucking weed. Not because of withdrawal or lack of willpower but because internally I was in hell. The depression and anxiety and overall feeling of dread I experienced back then was as I said something only an addict can understand. And honesty the part I find weird is that I was more emotionally distraught when all I did was weed than later in my using when I actually  was addicted to hard drugs that induced withdrawal. </p>

<p>Addiction is a disease. It’s not a choice. Addicts make the same choice to use drugs just like any other person. Supposedly the phenomenon of craving is what separates us. When an addict uses something happens that just makes them want more. No amount of any drug will satisfy the craving. An example is with alcoholics, when normal people have a couple drinks they get tired and don’t like feeling out of control so they stop. When an alcoholic takes the same drinks they feel like they are just getting started. This is why many alcoholics drink until they puke and pass out. Their body gives up before their brain is satisfied. </p>

<p>Addiction is so complicated not everything is known about it to this day. However it is accepted as a disease by all medical associations at least in the United States . And I’m passionate about this because obviously I am an addict and also because there is so much misconception and stigma attached to it. People say it’s a choice we just don’t have willpower and they just adds to the shame that we already carry with us. </p>
