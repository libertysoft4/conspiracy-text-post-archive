    <div class="md"><p>I’m not an optical physicist, an astronomer, or whatever. All I’m saying is that seeing weird lines and jumping to “it could be a fake projection” seems to be an extreme violation of Occam’s Razor. If you hear hoof beats, it’s probably a horse, not a zebra.</p>

<p>To reach the point where a fake moon projection theory reaches even the barest threshold of plausibility, you’d have to assert that:</p>

<p>1) Every record in human history that references the moon, including the many ancient myths that attempt to explain its origins and meaning, are forgeries that were created within the last few decades, when the kind of technology needed to pull off a moon projection would have been available.</p>

<p>(This kind of technology would not have been even have been available when we launched the moon mission, but it would have to have been to convince people there was a celestial body we were flying to).</p>

<p>2) That there is some benefit to somebody out there to project a celestial body that essentially has no real value to humanity.</p>

<p>3) That this projection technology is ubiquitous across the entire world, so therefore is operated by a global entity with no obvious motivation.</p>

<p>4) That there is a projection surface surrounding the planet completely in order to maintain the detail we can make out with the naked eye, which also implicated the sun as a forgery (which would then require an explanation of where that solar energy that feeds life on Earth comes from).</p>

<p>5) That the resolution of the projection is so profoundly high that it fools everybody with a high-power telescope.</p>

<p>Is all that an easier explanation than a photo glitch, optical illusion, or weird cloud?</p>

<p>Being into conspiracies is fun if you can come up with valid explanations, but it’s not fun when you simply point to a weird picture. There are WAY too many loose ends here for the “moon projection” theory to be viable.</p>

<p>You could, if you wanted, retreat into the “we’re in the Matrix” argument, but that argument is valid for every strange experience, and kind of lazy.</p>

<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and you have some work to do before some glitchy-looking pictures can be considered extraordinary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make valid points and I&#39;m well aware it&#39;s not the most parsimonious explanation.</p>

<p>But the fact that this phenomenon has been verified from multiple sources from different locations on the planet tells me there&#39;s more to this than meets the eye.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing on Google or in the scientific literature that explains this phenomenon.  If you have an alternate explanation I&#39;m all ears.</p>

Now what I think is, this alien invasion occured, the moon was their &quot;parasite machine&quot; and how the got here, wich was designed to our earth(check all the mathematical singularities between earth and moon) it caused the big flood, that them caused the ancient civilization collapse. </p>
