Do you guys have any theories? Do you believe it has been done, if so what convinced you? If you dont believe it has been done tell me why too! 
Lets make some good points on both sides please 😂</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, how could it even be possible? Let&#39;s speak logically for a reason. Time isn&#39;t constant, it&#39;s human-made, correct? Everything is happening all at once. The past/present/future. Are events that have happened stored somewhere? Is life, as it&#39;s progressing, being saved somewhere? If not, then how can you go back to something that doesn&#39;t exist? The past doesn&#39;t exist, it&#39;s gone. Because time isn&#39;t real. It&#39;s just a measurement. </p>

<p>I do believe that there might be other dimensions or other &#39;Earth&#39;s but I think they are in sync with this Earth, if that makes any sense. </p>

<p>You know what actual time travel is? If I board on a plane from the UK at 2pm and I land in L.A and it&#39;s 6am. Isn&#39;t that time travel? I just went from 2pm to 6am. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time is not constant, but not human made either. It&#39;s part of the fabric of space-time, hence the name. We created units of measurement for it in order to measure entropy, similar to C/F on a thermometer. Temperature wasn&#39;t created by humans though, was it?</p>

<p>Our current theories of quantum physics in relation to space-time don&#39;t discount the possibility that the past, future and present could all happening at the same moment, now (the only moment that 100% exists). If that were the case, the past/future would take place in the same physical location as the present, but in a different location on the 4th dimensional plane, and it would just be a question of being able to access it.  Not saying that I think it&#39;s plausible or that it&#39;s been done, just saying it&#39;s not completely impossible  given what we know at this point. </p>

And you may not so perhaps all this is moot, but, people who have had cardiac arrest, gone beyond the &quot;white light&quot; and come back all describe a place in which time has absolutely no meaning. One quote I believe was something to the effect of &quot;you could say it was 10,000 years, or five minutes, and it wouldn&#39;t make any difference&quot;. So time is a construct here, on this plane.

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure the issues with time travel is you can only travel forward and back <em>only</em> to the point when the time machine began working, and no further back than that, based on the laws of physics, and you need near black hole levels of energy to fuel this. When you travel extremely fast, like near the speed of light levels, you actually age slower than people that are traveling slower than you. The reasoning is complex as you can imagine, but it&#39;s been studied in astronauts that spend long periods of time in the ISS that have a twin sibling, where their telomeres (end caps of your DNA that shorten with age) were longer on the sibling that was in the ISS as it travels at a high rate of speed around earth. If you&#39;ve ever watched Interstellar then you&#39;ll see this science actually used as a plot piece in the movie. </p>

<p>You can just see a scientist adding the final piece of the machine, then the moment they power it on, someone steps out the door of the time machine. Before the inventor even has a chance to blink. Then people just continuously arrive every second.</p>

<p>If that were a limit to how far you&#39;d go back in time, pretty sure alot of people would choose to go back to that time. It would be the best clown-car magic trick ever.</p>

<p>No, anytime time you&#39;re moving you&#39;re aging slower. If you are driving your car, you&#39;ll be aging slower than someone who&#39;s walking/standing (of course it&#39;s like 0.000000000000001 or something like that).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not entirely sure if the ISS example is really applicable though.  On Earth your already traveling very fast, so it seems doubtful that the the speed experienced by astronauts in the ISS would be different enough to cause any notable differences in aging, especially since both speeds are basically the same when comparing them to the speed of light.  If there is slower aging of astronauts, it seems more likely that it would be caused from being in a reduced gravity environment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if you don&#39;t need to go &quot;back&quot; in time. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a theory that the universe somehow created itself, along with the suggestion that space is curved, time may also be curved. If you were to picture the universe as existing on the surface of a sphere; when travelling in a straight line, you will eventually end up where you left off (just like walking across a planet).</p>

<p>What if the &quot;arrow of time&quot; works in a similar way. If you travel far enough into the future, you eventually end up at the beginning. </p>

<p>With time being relative, where blackholes slow down time the nearer you get to them. What if you could create an anti-blackhole to accelerate time from your perspective.</p>

<p>I saw an interesting video about this the other day, but forget what the title of it was. Simply put, the classic example of drawing two points on a sheet of paper, folding it, to illustrate wormhole travel. It had a similar concept, except if you draw an arrow across the sheet of paper, then roll it into a cylinder... it shows how a curved spacetime might actually have no end nor beginning and time is effectively an infinite loop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main theory that makes &quot;Go back and kill your grandfather&quot; time travel impossible is where traveling would send you back in an alternate universe where anything you do is incorporated into their secondary #2 timeline, while the original #1 timeline goes on without you. Your grandfather dies, so you are never born... but you were never supposed to in timeline #2.  No paradoxes allowed.</p>

<p>The point I want to make is If The &quot;Media&quot; becomes abolished by the mass majority would that time traveler know to look in a news paper, something which didn&#39;t exist from their time.</p>

<p>Could the time traveler themselves have no interest in science or exposing themselves. It&#39;s selfish to think Steven Hawking would be a beacon to a person where Time Travel could be common place for tourist,military or other reasons.</p>

<p>So you need to make finding time travelers more common and more widespread. Where would you get funding to run a world wide campaign to attract Time Travelers, A on-going permanent Beacon that appeals to all time-lines and languages.

<p>The Earth rotates once every 24 hours <em>respective to the sun</em>. 
We&#39;re not concerned with the sun here.</p>

<p>The Moon orbits the earth aprx. every 28 <em>days</em>.
So in your calculation you basically have to divide that distance it moved by 28. </p>

<p>Secondly, the laser beam itself is 3 miles wide by the time it reaches the Moon! </p>

<p>Only a few photons make it back to Earth every second, to catch them they basically have to aim really carefully.</p>

<p>You might want to read up on stuff first and have a little humility that maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, your&#39;re totally wrong, before you make wild claims about stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do not yet have a publicly acknowledged theory that fully equates our &quot;time-sense&quot; to some &quot;fourth dimension&quot; which we can access.</p>

<p>But we have a huge amount of science that skirts very close to it.</p>

<p>There are many problems that have to do with the &quot;access&quot; problem. In a standard Sci-Fi film we would just throw in a &quot;Time Portal&quot;. But as far as you and I know, that&#39;s a fiction.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s drive past the problem of not having a Time Portal and concentrate on what we would need in order to use a Time Portal safely and effectively, and what such a device would actually do.</p>

<p>In the movies there would be a big display with a Year and a Location. That would show you where the Time Portal is going to send you. The Date and Time serve as an index. They themselves are essentially artificially imposed abstractions. To see that, just consider why all creatures and most humans throughout history have never needed either a map or a clock to live full lives - it&#39;s just a convenience we have invented in the last few millennium. And I am quite sure God or the Universe does not need to keep a Calendar on His/Its desk.</p>

<p>So in order to use the Time Portal, we need to apply this arbitrary index that tells us where/when we want to go, or else we could go who knows where and when. I will call that a Time-Space Index (TSI).</p>

<p>So here&#39;s where things get interesting. Note we are not talking about the method to get a human to travel (or just view) a different place and time, but rather the TSI which could plausibly point to any given destination. Days, Years, Lats and Longs are UNKNOWN to atomic quanta.</p>

<p>If we could crack the problem of creating a valid TSI, then the technology of the Time Portal or the Time Viewer would probably be in reach, assuming we understand black holes and can create a technology that includes a &quot;managed black hole&quot;. At this point, we would start talking about neutrinos and similar phenomena, which appear to be able to &quot;fold space-time&quot;.</p>

<p>Back to the TSI. Formulating a TSI would be the equivalent of triangulation in land surveying. If you know some points in a given field, you can find the rest. So this is where understanding a whole range of time-based sciences, from Geology and Paleontology to Ecology and Astronomy, and throw in a healthy dose of History and Genealogy and Archaeology (assuming you want to visit the past of the human species). Using such scientific &quot;databases&quot; we could possibly calculate the necessary TSIs to program the Portal to travel there.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s a catch. The Multiverse. If we accept that we live in a universe which includes an infinite number of sub-universes, all overlapping each other (which is a subject treated by other posters to this discussion) then the TSI has to also define which of many possible universes to pick for a given &quot;historical&quot; or &quot;future&quot; TSI.</p>

<p>tldr; we&#39;re working on it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>consciousness-driven simulation.<br/>
Computers are things we humans have created to mimick things in nature that are already designed for information processing, like brains. To say the simulation is computer-driven would just be human arrogance.<br/>
It&#39;s annoying that saying &quot;simulation&quot; often comes with the assumption of being computer-driven, but that&#39;s a bit disingenuous, because we don&#39;t *know</em> that. It&#39;s just an extrapolation based on minimal data points. What we can at least say, though, is that this universe <em>effectively acts</em> as a simulation, because this isn&#39;t the only possible version of things. There&#39;s an infinite number of versions of the universe, so therefore this one isn&#39;t absolute. It&#39;s just one expression. A &quot;simulation&quot; of this set of possibilities, if you will. But attributing it to a computer, simply because we humans have created something that is capable of simulating things (a computer) ignores all the other things that are also just as capable of simulating things.<br/>
I think it&#39;s consciousness-driven because I believe matter itself, at a fundamental level, <em>is</em> consciousness. It&#39;s just energy acting with itself within a self-referential universal feedback-loop system. Consciousness therefore creates a fractal system which, from within, it can experience every possible perspective - from every atom, molecule, and rock, to every plant, animal, or person - across all of time and space available within that universe. At the same time it&#39;s also simulating every other possible version of the universe, but on a different base frequency, so as not to allow them significantly &quot;interfere&quot; with one another. </p>
