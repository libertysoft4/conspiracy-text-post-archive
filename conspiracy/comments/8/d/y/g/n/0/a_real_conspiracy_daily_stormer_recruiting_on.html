<p>Here you can see the hidden post. For some reason, this post was removed, and the reason given was that &quot;that post was made by a troll who is now in prison&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how that makes any difference. If Nazi groups like Daily Stormer are recruiting on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and perhaps even one of the MODS here are Daily Stormer nazis, then I think that sure as hell is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Because as u/flytape explained, the person who penned this article is someone who is a known rabble rouser and disseminator of Disinfo, seeking to rile up both sides. That post is nothing but an attempt to smear this sub and its user base.</p>

<p>Flytape isn&#39;t a mod...so yeah. Also, again, it doesn&#39;t give any evidence, it&#39;s a fucking libelous article smearing a user as a fucking Nazi. That&#39;s a serious fucking accusation dude- and it offers <em>no fucking proof</em>. The whole article is a hit piece on this sub- how do you not see that?</p>

<p>The author of this hit piece, Joshua Goldberg is currently serving a prison sentence at <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Medical_Center,_Butner">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Medical_Center,_Butner</a></p>

<p>Why might you ask, is Goldberg serving a prison sentence? And why is Flytape claiming that the daily stormer article by &quot;Michael Slay&quot; was actually a Jewish man named Joshua Goldberg?</p>

<p>&quot;Michael Slay&quot;</p>

<p>Goldberg posted on the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer as &quot;Michael Slay&quot;.</p>

<p>One well-known article by this persona regarding how to recruit people from Reddit (particularly the &quot;r/conspiracy&quot; and &quot;r/Europe&quot; subreddits), described as &quot;fertile ground for recruitment&quot; was commented on by Sam Biddle in a Gawker article.[35]</p>

<p>As you can see the OP has been mislead by a Jewish troll who is in federal prison for organizing REAL WORLD acts of terrorism.</p>

<p>Now the only real question here is if the OP of this hit piece <a href="/u/boringaverage">/u/boringaverage</a> intentionally trying to mislead you by reincarnation of a troll and terrorist Jewish man or is the OP themselves just ignorant of the truth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I dont like Nazis due to their socilist policies and historic monstrocities as a &#39;party&#39; in germany. . .</p>

<p>Yet, since R/news and R/world news has become r/JIDF and r/Israel, Im almost welcoming of Nazi ideology more.</p>

<p>They are not &#39;good&#39; people, yet, it seems, nor are these Israelis who support genocide all the same - biblical and in recent history of &#39;self determination&#39;.</p>

<p>So, whose really the &#39;bad&#39; guys?</p>

<p>I dont see Nazis in 2018 trying to sque the truth about geopolitics, raid EVERY US tax-payer of 68 USD a year, and is activly killing civilians in open-air concentration camps. </p>

<p>So, Nazi on, so long as it&#39;s just talk and rhetoric. That is, Unless Israel stops paying their concepts to feed the US and world populations bullshit - then all things are equal and there is no reactive need for the nazi presence in the world, right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like these fucks exists in a vacuum. They exist for reasons.</p>

<p>Like the day ashki-jews became &#39;Israelis&#39; and subsequently created the &#39;Palestinian&#39;, the Nazi is an emergence of anti-bulshivikism which has a higher than &#39;organic&#39; amount of Jews in those early communist and soviet days; is this true, does not matter - factions exist in form of radical reactionaryism. PEriod!</p>

<p>So, in this same respect, when we ALL see israel doing what it does, with duel citizens in the US supporting that cause over the US one, it creates REACTIONARIES. </p>

<p>So, make the game fair, or play against an opponent who does not care about the rules. That&#39;s the game.</p>

<p>Nelson Mandela</p>

<p>Terrorist. </p>

<p>See my other post about &#39;no good angels&#39; existing. So, only dialog should. </p>

<p>To be clear: I agree with what you intend and Mandela said.</p>

<p>Nazis exist not in a vacuum. They are reactionary, and to address their existence is to address their concerns in a level of dialog to clear up incongruity and blatant lies - you know, same as &#39;therapy&#39;.</p>

<p>IN the same respect, the Israeli conscript who finds it morally acceptable to shoot press agents, around an open-air concentration camps, cant be seen as better than a nazi on reddit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not whataboutism, it&#39;s about equal footing of dialog so mediation of philosophies can take place in the LIBERAL public. </p>

<p>Liber = &#39;free&#39;; we are free to discuss things on equal footing, or the game is not fair so reactionary movements arise. </p>

<p>Reading little about nazis, but watching lots of history channel, which equates to almost nothing of true knowledge on the power-structure of the early nazi regime:  it seems in alll cases that their emergence to power was started in the same ostrification and perceived destitution of people not being &#39;heard&#39; or &#39;respected&#39;. </p>

<p>Oddly, the same argument for self-determination.</p>

<p>People act crazy and do selfish things against strangers when they think they aught to have better. </p>

<p>The average person who joined that early nazi group did so because they felt the group supported them - not because they inherently hated other people; they clearly did not, historically.</p>

<p>So, from the wisdom of one former &#39;terrorist&#39; named Mandela, appears as a peace maker to others long after his vilification days - he was victorious in delivering that voice that wanted to be heard. </p>

<p>Just reminds me of what I read about those evil nazies then, and these hopeless reactionaries that call themselves &#39;nazies&#39; for a sense of meaning, now. .along with the reactionary history of peoples perceptions of &#39;being heard&#39;, which relates to &#39;ostrification&#39; over &#39;expression&#39;, we are looking at a future of more nazis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both of which are true.  I despise Israel and Zionism.  I have nothing against Jewish people.  And although I believe the Germans did round up and murder a lot of Jews, there is no&#39;t really much evidence to support the &#39;6 million Jews killed claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does the &#39;6 million jews&#39;™ claim matter?</p>

<p>You believe the Nazis did round up and murder a lot of Jews. So there was a holocaust, right? It&#39;s almost as if people try to nitpick on the number to cast doubt onto the whole event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a holocaust of sorts, yes.  It just wasn&#39;t anywhere near as bad as we&#39;ve been told.  Tens of thousands, possibly as many as a quarter million, sure.</p>

<p>The problem is that an6body who questions the official narrative at all gets labeled a Nazi.  I&#39;m not a Nazi, and I detest fascism.  That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m willing to swallow ridiculous propaganda for the sake of political correctness.</p>
