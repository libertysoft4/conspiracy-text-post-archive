        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is no secret that Reddit is dying, driven in large part by a massive influx of bad actors, shills, and disinfo agents across the entire site. Those of you banned from one sub or another are well aware of this- that certain subs have invisible walls, which when run up against result in an immediate rebuff. We’ve even seen subs themselves change. Personally, I saw r/politics morph over the course of the Dem Convention from pro-Bernie, anti-HRC, anti-DNC, anti-Corporatists to the exact opposite.</p>

<p>Suddenly, discussion that could be had one week could not be had the next. Later, I saw r/wikileaks become co-opted when Assange went dark in October of ’16, and the sub r/whereisassange was founded to handle the now banned discussions from that sub concerning his whereabouts. Many of us also saw the banning of r/pizzagate later in November.</p>

<p>Because of this, r/conspiracy has become a true battleground- of ideas and philosophies, but also of shills, disinfo agents, and those of varying agendas. The best, and in my opinion the only, good way to fight this, and to accept the reality of the current condition of r/conspiracy, with an aim towards fighting back and improving it, is to browse by /new.</p>

<p>/new is the beating heart of the sub- it is ground zero in the fight against the shills. It allows real, generic users to set the tone of discussion, to have their say via voting, and to help influence the sub. Don’t feel forced to contribute- but hop in where you think you have something to add! At the very least, a single Real One posting first in a thread makes the shills and bad actors <em>react</em> to them and their statements, rather than place their own, and gives the generic comments more of an opportunity to be seen and upvoted out of the darkness.</p>

<p>This is how we fight- this is how we keep the sub in the hands of the community. This is how we ensure r/conspiracy remains as one of the last places for discussions and exchange of ideas on Reddit. We <em>must</em> browse by /new.</p>

<p>This exactly. It takes months usually for someone to get comfortable enough to start speaking up, but even if just a few do, then it will help the sub out exponentially. Every additional Real One we get browsing /new is another ally in the fight.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It was a trade off, really. The 60 day rule and SS&#39;s stop the immediate ability to forum slide- and give those already established here some breathing room. But it also allows a small group of already established shills to just keep camping. I personally think the 60 day rule and SS&#39;s are more beneficial than harmful, however. </p>

<p>Over at least a year here,  I imagine I&#39;ve left less than ten comments. What I consider a reasonable opinion is far too mainstream here,  so when/if I do speak up,  I&#39;m just yelled at for parroting back MSM crap. 
The thing is,  I try to use reliable,  science-based sources and I&#39;m still shot down.  Either no one genuinely wants to engage and listen to another voice,  or anything that isn&#39;t a fringe media site is automatically poopoo&#39;ed. So tell me,  why should I even bother? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That really depends on what you are actually saying/claiming to believe. People who want war in the ME or choose to listen to everything the Corporate Propaganda Media has to say usually don&#39;t get along too well round these parts, but that&#39;s because after looking into things long enough you realize that the MSM <em>is</em> propaganda, and so while they can&#39;t be completely ignored, they absolutely should not be trusted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing is, I try to use reliable, science-based sources and I&#39;m still shot down. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep using those sources- many people here use reliable, science based sources to back their conspiracy theories- even ones that go against everything the MSM is saying. Again, this would be very specific on a case by case basis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either no one genuinely wants to engage and listen to another voice, or anything that isn&#39;t a fringe media site is automatically poopoo&#39;ed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>People will read MSM posts here, but they will also pick them apart and expose their biases, just like people do for &quot;fringe media sites&quot;. Just because it&#39;s the NYT or WaPo or Fox doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re reliable- the news is utterly broken in this country, and the Free Press is mostly dead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So tell me, why should I even bother?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ya know, I hold political opinions that differ with many here- yet we all get along just fine. I respect that people have different views than me and am still fine engaging them in a friendly way, in an attempt to exchange information. Who cares about downvotes? Just keep being you and engaging with the community- this is the internet- where the karma is made up and the points don&#39;t matter. </p>

<p>According to snoopsnoo.com, 3 months ago you had made zero comments on this sub.</p>

<p>Looks to me like you are lying and pushing a false narrative, bud. Sorry. I&#39;m open to being proven wrong, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for replying, even if to express skepticism at the truth. I suppose that&#39;s the heartbeat of this sub, after all. </p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m just weighing in on a topic that specifically addressed lurkers. That&#39;s me. Snoopsnoo then just confirmed exactly what I said - that I rarely post in here. The last thread that I commented on was completely deleted (as happens occasionally around here), as were all the replies to my post. This was the case that I am thinking of. So excuse me if this doesn&#39;t pan out in your eyes, but you can take your &quot;lying and false narrative&quot; and put that right back in your pipe. </p>

<p>I like to haunt around and I occasionally read links that are posted for another opinion on a topic. I enjoy looking at things from another angle, and to consider the things that not everyone may recognize. </p>

<p>Being told I am pushing anything is ridiculous. If you are going to go around straight up call out folks for shit that ain&#39;t happening, that might be why people are so into lurking and not participating. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry about me, I&#39;ll go back to the shadows.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say this sub is losing much with you. Besides, if those immediate upvotes on a day old post are any indication, we&#39;ll be seeing you around here in one form or another.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not. Like you yourself admitted, you don&#39;t have many comments here. With never ending Reddit and ctrl-f you can do in 20 seconds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t care enough to go back through three years of posts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s funny on 3 levels, cause earlier you tried to make it sound like the alleged attack happened within the last year, snoopsnoo already showed you have no posts here prior to 3 months ago, <em>and</em> you can easily list your entire history and ctrl-f it to see this is again, a lie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are really that invested in proving me dishonest, have at it.</p>

<p>I already did, and provided the methods by which anyone else could have, as well. If these attacks on your comments existed, you would have already linked an example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s important to have all voices heard. Otherwise the place just becomes the home of edgelords and basement warriors. However you have to know scientific research is hard to trust these days as well, scientists are like anyone else they need to make a living, if a government came to you and said, “ I’m having a fight with the coal minors, can you research into the negative effects coal has”. The scientists then go away and find out that burning fossil fuels ‘could’ effect the environment and ‘may’ effect weather patterns and will ‘probably’ warm the earth etc. They get a big fat check and Maggy Thantcher has more ammunition against the minors she is fighting.   Yes that’s how burning fossil fuels became so evil.  </p>

<p>Yet we take it as scientific fact that burning fossil fuels effects the environment. Yes it makes things sooty and the air shit. But does if effect the weather ? No one actually knows, but the pointers are that no it doesn’t.  So just be open minded about the scientific studies that are fed to us, they themselves are often the conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to encourage new users to participate given the current climate of the sub. The disruptors have done an excellent job at making us fight with them instead of helping burgeoning new users find more information. It is also difficult with the MSM&#39;s constant ridiculing of anything conspiracy. It&#39;s pathological at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right now, the flow of posts/activity has been slowed enough on this sub (partly due to the 60 day rule and the SS&#39;s, ironically) to where a shill group can easily maintain control over the content, and what reaches the front page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rule 13 needs to go. Unfortunately most are holding tight to their belief in its success. I just don&#39;t see it. I agree that it has given even more power to the disruptors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We had many people spamming news articles from scummy/questionable journalism over and over, to the extent that it seemed like it just people recruiting for their site and then the bots started in. You had to wade through new using hip waders. </p>

<p>SS makes the user to at least think about even a slight reason they are posting...before, the treated conspiracy a channel for advertising and it was hard for some to continue posting 10 or more articles or youtube fictional articles in a row. In their acivity history that is all they did, no discussion in their posts, no point or topic to guide or converse about.</p>

<p>Sure, people for that now but at a much lesser impact,  imho if we get rid of SS it will return.</p>

<p>May look at shortening the 60 day rule?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that spammers can be a burden and sometimes do inhibit good posts from getting higher, this seems to be an overstated problem imo. Couldn&#39;t these spammers be dealt with on an individual basis. From my experience there are only ever a few spammers on the sub at once. The dedicated users are always on the watch to call it out (as I have been called out for it before). </p>

<p>The SS statement presents too many barriers compared to the alleged benefits: Users that wish to remain anonymous now must personalize the information presented, the post may now contain the bias of the user, neurotic people have a hard enough time posting ffs, it might discourage those who see no reason why they should go the extra step for this community compared to the rest of the site, it destroys spontaneity, it gives users yet another reason to concern troll, it gives mods yet another rule which can be unjustly enforced, etc.</p>

<p>I do agree about shortening the 60 day rule.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That type of account should certainly be dealt with in a swift manner. The desire to censor and the desire for freedom tug greatly both ways right now. Thor would just drop the hammer. </p>

<p>Part of the problem may be the varying types of posts we see here. Not only is this a news hub, it is a personal one as well. Allowing for freedom in editorializing the headline means there is no one post that can be accepted as the only one to stand. This means the same article can be spammed over and over again, as we see with many subjects. </p>

<p>I agree fully with this users&#39; post, if you want to remain anonymous you will give up on ever posting to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> simply for having to post a SS.

    <div class="md"><p>Different people take different things from here. I personally think, at the deepest level, the &quot;grand conspiracy&quot; is the conspiracy of the suppression of consciousness, and that every other conspiracy is simply an off-shoot of that, filtered down through different respective societal lenses and such. I used to come here for the politics, then moved onto the more &quot;out there&quot; stuff (aliens, alternative history, paranormal etc), and now I mostly come here just to keep generally updated on the place and to comment.<br/>
What I personally use this place for now and what I take from it is purely for self improvement on a soul level. I believe we humans need to work on discovering our true potentials as conscious entities, our true origins, the mechanics of consciousness, and love. I believe everything is the same universal consciousness at the core, just split into infinite things to experience being from an infinite number of relative perspectives. I believe that once we, as humans, come to realise that (or at least once enough of us do - a lá &quot;hundredth monkey effect&quot;/reaching critical mass point) then tyrannical power structures will simply dissolve as a natural result of that collective self realisation. And that&#39;s the reality I&#39;m currently manifesting.<br/>
It certainly has the potential for some good to use forums and sites like this to organise some kind of activism to take down the current power structures. That&#39;s a role that needs to be filled, and what better people to fill it than those most aware? My advice: keep sharing information of course, and just act on what you feel you need to. Obviously everyone doesn&#39;t have to take part in everything. We&#39;re people. We&#39;re different. We specialise in different things. So don&#39;t lose yourself by trying to fill all the roles - just the ones that you can and that you think you need to. You do you, I do me, and remember we&#39;re all the same consciousness just living in different bodies. One love ✌</p>

<p>Infowars and the like have been doing this a long time. They are held to zero accountability for their &quot;reporting&quot; standards. Just toss bullshit until something sticks. No one remembers the hundreds of insane r/conspiritard stories, they just flock to the one that stuck. </p>

<p>If the stories were posted in a way that warrants further discussion, and research, great. But the MO of this sub is to find an insane conclusion, and then dig as hard as possible to try to prove that conclusion, ignoring anything that disagrees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or just retake the language. A historian I like, Michael Parenti, has a good bit where he counters the accusation of being a conspiracy theorist by asking whether the other person is a coincidence theorist, that is, do they think the oligarchs just happen to take actions that just so happen to line up and coordinate with other oligarchs for the mutual benefit?</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t the name &quot;conspiracy theorist,&quot; for what it is it&#39;s accurate enough. The problem is the connotations and associations in the mind of the public, but that can be changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say I identify more with truth seeker as well. I guess my point is not that we need to identify with it, but that we should not cede the <strong>linguistic battleground</strong>. Because of the beliefs we have (and that varies quite a bit here), we are seen as conspiracy theorists by others, and many people judge us, and more importantly our <em>ideas</em>, by what their perception of a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is. </p>

<p><strong>Whoever defines the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; in the popular understanding will determine what people think of actual conspiracy theories</strong>. One side of the game knows this, and that&#39;s why they tar and smear dissident &quot;communities&quot; like conspiracy theorists. This is why they highlight certain conspiracy theorists (AJ has been in the mainstream news lately), to associate any conspiracy <em>theory</em> with their chosen caricature of a conspiracy <em>theorist</em>. </p>

<p>Imagine if the MSM played a James Corbett video, any one of them, and tried to criticize him. People would look him up, and see that he was actually reasonable, calm, rational, and extremely well-researched in the content he produced. Many people would probably listen to and agree with a lot of what he said. This is why Alex Jones is the face of conspiracy theorists in the corporate media. </p>

<p>They do the same with AntiFa by the way. AntiFa are a bunch of assholes themselves, but that is why they are presented as the face of all anti-fascism. It&#39;s a claiming and therefore a defining of linguistic territory. Many people, especially on the right, are conflating AntiFa the assholes with the idea of being against fascism. We should very much be against fascism, even if the people called AntiFa are assholes. Just like we very much should research and educate people about conspiracy theories, even if people called &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; are defamed and considered crazy. </p>

<p>It&#39;s somewhat how African Americans reclaimed the word &quot;nigger&quot; as &quot;nigga.&quot; &quot;Nigger&quot; is what ignorant, white racists called them, and how that outside group defined them. &quot;Nigga&quot; is what they called themselves, and to each other, and it became how they could define themselves. If we let others put labels on us, and let them define those labels, then we will always be misunderstood because people will have made up their mind before they even listen to what we have to say. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We should identify as whatever we feel aligned with, but we should not cede the linguistic battleground for the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; by letting it be defined for us by people other than us.</p>

<p>The trouble is there is a concerted propaganda effort at the moment. These syria attack posts were upvoted to hell, and that in itself is a conspiracy.  We are at a disadvantage though, we are individuals with our own opinions and our own voices. Where as shills are not working to their own opinion or their own voice, they are working to directives.  </p>

<p>Just think of what each of us could do given a team of say ten people each with at least three accounts to push a theory or agenda. ?  They just need to talk across a desk on how to disrupt a post or push an agenda. We on the other hand are just speaking our minds </p>

<p>You are right we need to fight back. And more people need to speak their minds. Though when they see some posts get attacked I doubt it’s an incentive for others to posts. </p>

<p>It truly is asymmetric information warfare. They don&#39;t need to hide information, or manipulate it, as long as there is enough contradictory and superfluous information. &quot;We&#39;ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false&quot; is a much easier task than actually discovering and spreading truth. </p>

<p>The antidote to bad information is not just more information, but a way telling the truth from the lies and rumors. These are the skills of critical thinking, journalistic practice, and becoming cognizant of one&#39;s own biases. If we, individually and collectively, are failing to learn and teach these skills, any information we spread is essentially useless to most who would come across it. </p>

<p>If we are sharing anything on this sub on broader reddit, it should be the skill of critical thinking and the willingness to apply it to <em>all</em> our knowledge about the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great freaking post u/bradok. If nothing else it&#39;s nice to know there are core authentic people out there. It has become obvious when a post gets shilled or brigaded. The fact that this post remains untouched indicates to me that whatever tools they use for watching are looking for keyword and they aren&#39;t just browsing.</p>

<p>Brigading sucks but that&#39;s still real users that have widely differing opinions and a bully mentality. We can handle that. It&#39;s govt and corporate shills that make me sick - they are willfully subverting our constitutional rights (or human rights if your country doesn&#39;t allow free speech). This is happening everywhere, not just Reddit and in a way we&#39;re lucky because we&#39;re ahead of the curve on recognizing it.</p>

<p>Anyway, this may be a bad idea but I wonder if we could take some of the recent hot button topics and try giving them a modified title - using special characters instead of the real letters and see what the response is. The main topic they&#39;re killing on lately is seereeyuh. It&#39;s clearer than ever that posts are being monitored and attacked. Reasonable opinions just crushed through the floor with votes. Sliding everywhere. Attacking messengers. And always promoting the narrative. I&#39;m curious if we could get some authentic discussion by changing the title alone or if they also monitor internal discussion. I&#39;m sure they follow certain &quot;trouble&quot; users.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is maybe if we can understand how they target better, we may be able to take countermeasures. Again, really appreciate the thoughtful discussion here - it warms my cold, dead heart :)</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible, and I&#39;ve known some people to do this from time to time. The problem is that it also makes it harder for the post to naturally rise.

IDC what you believe, YOU are the reason the bots, tmor goons, ctr, and many other groups are being paid to set the narrative in every post... so that by the time YOU see it, it&#39;s EXACTLY how they want you to see it. if that doesn&#39;t happen, the post or even individual comments are kept below threshold by vote manipulation. </p>

<p>I admit, I scroll past comment threads, more often than I should, anyone else? in those tangents, THAT&#39;S where the knowledge is evolving. THAT&#39;S where we can all help one another. </p>

<p>There is a difference between not agreeing with Israel, and antisemitism, yet if you just read just the hatebots, or the paidshills, or the top/best answers, you will find a very defined rhetoric that detracts from the opinions and links provided by others. they will say, &quot;don&#39;t even bother, internet aids.&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s just what, a pede,libtard,commie,islamic,nazi,shill,ctr,snowflake,sjw,christian,hindu,queer,terrorist would say, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit has overtaken other social media simply going by Alexa scoring.  More eyes means more money and a massive decline in the quality of discussion and content to the lowest common denominator.  It also means the company is more handcuffed to perverse interests.</p>

<p>The front page formula is most likely what is driving the push towards &quot;safe space&quot; and bot driven site gaming practices.  Rarely will any post about any controversial topic make it to the front page from a subreddit that allows two sided discussion.  Consequently, you can restate the accepted opinion, or you can be banned.</p>

<p>This could be corrected by penalizing moderation in the scoring system.  However, I really don&#39;t think the admin are aware of their own biases.  They state that they follow a set of content rules, but they only enforce them against certain parts of the userbase, even for doxxing or threats of violence.  They don&#39;t seem to realize that if you don&#39;t enforce a policy uniformly, you don&#39;t really have a policy at all.</p>

<p>What shows the sad state of this sub is the top discussion with the mod right below this 16 upvotes post. A mod talking about a &quot;fact&quot;, saying he &quot;can prove it&quot;, but that he &quot;feels no need to do so for you.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the EXACT opposite of what this sub should be. If you can prove that whatever you&#39;re saying is true, then fucking DO IT, expose stuff FFS. Change the minds of people who can&#39;t see that truth.</p>

<p>That discussion is clearly showing how much of an echo chamber this sub is becoming, we only talk to ourselves, we don&#39;t even try to engage conversation with someone who might see things differently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/politics was never so venomously anti-Clinton before the primaries. The Clintons were treated neutrally or somewhat positively for the most part. Then the primary hits and its nothing but straight vitriol for Clinton, with blatant propaganda from foreign countries making it to the front page, and the &quot;far left&quot; posting obvious rightwing propaganda. Then, suddenly, it stopped and the sub was back to neutral to pro-Clinton when the primaries ended. </p>

<p>What&#39;s hilarious with the claims about CTR, is the &quot;flip&quot; in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> directly coincided with Bernie exiting the race, and ceasing payments to Revolution Messaging (a company directly funded by the Bernie campaign, with more than 3x the budget of Correct The Record, whose mission statement specifically included growing Bernie-supporting communities on reddit).</p>

<p>We know Russia had trolls on reddit supporting Trump and Bernie, and disparaging Hillary. We know Bernie hired Revolution Messaging with a budget over $20 million. Yet it is the smaller group with... what was it? $1-2 million budget? that got all the heat. </p>

<p>Gee, I wonder what the origin was of the outrageously huge number of comments so hyper-focused and targeted at a group that was specifically meant to push back against disinformation about Hillary Clinton? Couldn&#39;t be the much more highly funded organization being paid directly by her opponent?  And why was any criticism of Revolution Messaging completely drowned out, to the point that few even know of it? Any even slight mention of it in places like r/politics was instantly downvoted to oblivion. <em>I wonder why</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>I was on<a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> at the time (on a previous account). I was originally on the fence between Hillary and Bernie, but got really tired of being called a shill and &quot;CTR&quot; whenever I called someone out for a flat-out lie about Hillary (sound familiar?). It was <em>toxic</em> if you didn&#39;t toe the &quot;Hillary is evil&quot; line. Eventually I stopped going to that sub, and only returned to it once Hillary got the nomination. It wasn&#39;t immediate, but we started getting a lot fewer concern trolls and die-hard Bernie supporters... and the sub became a good bit friendlier to Hillary supporters. What the OP sees as the sub flipping was, in fact, primarily due to the concern trolls and faux Bernie supporters giving up on the sub.</p>

<p>And hell, OP won&#39;t even accept your explanation... which kinda says all you need to know about his/her motive with this thread, I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its way more anti-Trump than pro-Trump, that&#39;s for sure. Anything &quot;pro-Trump&quot;, even if its correcting inaccurate information, is mass downvoted in this sub. Just an example, I corrected someone who falsely claimed that Republicans funded the Steele dossier before the DNC/Clinton. I even linked proof that this was false yet I was still downvoted. </p>

<p>Go look at any anti-Trump post and you see the same pattern. Anti-Trump = upvotes. Pro-Trump = downvotes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we disagree. I see a lot of posts on Trump get little to no questioning, and there&#39;s literally a post in the front page right now about how the Russian collusion scandal (which has all the ingredients for a perfect conspiracy... If only Hillary was at the top of it) is just media created BS.         </p>

<p>I did a quick sweep and couldn&#39;t see any more recent posts directly referencing Trump, but besides him directly, you can see the sub is largely conservative and right-leaning. &quot;Liberal&quot; is an insult, the DNC probably gets more hate on this sub than big pharma does. And the disinfo campaign that&#39;s taking place doesn&#39;t help anyone at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always liked this one because similar to unpopularopinion it has ideas across the spectrum. Unlike unpopularopinion it has people who follow the news and know what they&#39;re talking about.  I stumbled on CMV and broke the damn sub. It&#39;s geared to younger folks and explicitly barrages a poster with arguments until they&#39;re forced to claim they&#39;ve changed. I would check over the course of the day and have 50+ replies at various times. That is where the engineering happens in its most basic form. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was writing this post specifically for this sub. But I do think that browsing /new is the best way to view Reddit. Problem is, unless you are a dedicated member of that particular sub, then browsing /new just doesn&#39;t seem natural to you. This post was made as a message to the r/conspiracy regulars who don&#39;t think/bother to browse by /new. </p>

<p>Personally, I think browsing by /new is just plain good redditing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am absolutely a lurker and and only ever browse by new. </p>

<p>Over at least a year here,  I imagine I&#39;ve left less than ten comments. What I consider a reasonable opinion is far too mainstream here,  so when/if I do speak up,  I&#39;m just yelled at for parroting back MSM crap. 
The thing is,  I try to use reliable,  science-based sources and I&#39;m still shot down.  Either no one genuinely wants to engage and listen to another voice,  or anything that isn&#39;t a fringe media site is automatically poopoo&#39;ed. So tell me,  why should I even bother? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add on this “too shy” thought, many will shy away because they do not want to be attacked. We see it all too often here and it needs to stop. I think effective enforcement of Rule 10 can put a stop to this. Attacking of the users, sub, &amp; source is a way to stifle dialogue. </p>

<p>I also think the 60 day wait and Rule 13 are working. </p>

<p>I was and I did. And it wasn’t what you’re saying. But that’s why you’re afraid to actually provide evidence, because we both know you can’t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to prefer comments as well. One thing you can do is go to new and skip ahead a few hours. That way you&#39;ll see more posts that already have comments, but often the commenters are still online as well, so you can still be part of the conversation. </p>

<p>With a 12 hour post on /hot with a couple hundred comments, the form has pretty much already been decided by past comments and votes. But at 2 hours, the post is still fresh and able to be influenced. </p>
