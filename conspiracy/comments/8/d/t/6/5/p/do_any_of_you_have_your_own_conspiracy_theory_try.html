    <div class="md"><p>Years ago I used to be an interior decorator (before &amp; right at the beginning of the internet). Here is what would ALWAYS happen: I would decorate somebody&#39;s room (or a few rooms). Then (it never failed) two months later an issue of a magazine would come out with the identical decor featured (same fabric, same paint/wallcoverings, etc.)! I think I was being watched and my ideas stolen.</p>

<p>Okay, how is that for my own conspiracy theory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my own?  the only true political view is a question of values, stemming from honesty compassion respect and tolerance.  </p>

<p>The left and right divide is manufactured, and targets the classical liberals, hippies, and libertarians (all whom practiced these values) - molding them into compatible left and compatible right parties which do not practice any of these values.  With values lost, the general population becomes easily manipulated, because the individual no longer has a compass to make individual decision, rather, tptb hands you that compass instead.</p>

<p>As per what is the most important conspiracy theory: 9/11 was a mossad job, and this either the truth that may one day take down the deep state, or be covered up for another century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Autism. I think that’s a conspiracy to bilk billions from unsuspecting people.  Sure, some people really do have autism but, today, practically everyone falls into being on “the spectrum”.  This generates tons and tons of money via therapy, testing, extra schooling for children, Occupational therapy, medicine, etc. I believe well intended doctors, assistants and teachers are unknowingly pushing an agenda they don’t even know exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s my own because it&#39;s fairly well known, but many also dont know about it. But I have looked into it a lot and have drawn my own conclusions. It involves the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/culturallayer/comments/7u0w1m">Phantom Time Hypothesis</a> and events that occurred between then and now. If you dont know about the phantom time hypothesis, click on that link and read up, lots of great stuff on that subreddit. But this is basically my theory on our real history. It&#39;s pretty out there and I wouldn&#39;t say that everything is accurate, but I would not be surprised if some version of this is true. </p>

<p>So, I think that Christianity was invented by the Jews as a way to bring about the destruction of the Roman empire. They had enough with being constantly shit on by every major world power in history, but after the final Jewish uprising around 200ad, they realized that they didn&#39;t have the manpower to take it by force, so they developed discrete tactics to take power. They spread Christianity throughout the world because they wanted people to switch away from Roman paganism, and knew that people would be more likely to switch to the new Christianity rather than Judiasm. In 330, Constantine converted the Roman empire to Christianity. The previous 80ish years leading up to that had Jews being treated as equals in the Roman empire more than any other time in history. So I suspect that the Jews had something to do with the Roman empire converting to Christianity and moving the capital to Constantinople. In c.390ad, the Serapeum, which housed the knowledge of the Roman gods, was ordered destroyed by the Pope. </p>

<p>Then enters the phantom time hypothesis. So we are told that the fall of the Eastern Roman empire was in 1453, but let&#39;s assume the phantom time hypothesis where the Eastern Roman empire fell in c.453 and the western empire fell in c.467. I think that between the I introduction of Christianity in 330 and the fall of the Eastern empire, the Roman pagans were not happy with this and revolted. The Christians then teamed up with the Persians in order to defeat the Romans, with Constantinople and most of the Eastern empire going to Persia who then became known as the Ottoman empire. The Western Roman empire was then split between the Christian leaders. Now, c.467, they begin a war to stamp out any of the leftovers of the Roman paganism. They called this the first four Crusades. After this was over, they said that the 100 or so years that it took were actually 1000 (or maybe 753 to get dates to line up with Julian calendar and be ambiguous) to give Christianity a stronger backing and make people think of paganism as an ancient religion. </p>

<p>So, now the year is approx. 1450. Everything that happened between the fall of the Roman empire and now was not necessarily made up, but happened in a much shorter timespan and for different reasons than we currently think. And there was a bunch of stuff made up as well. What was the Western Roman empire is ruled mainly by the Holy Roman Empire, France, England, and the Netherlands, with the House of Hapsburg being the main ruling family that other families came from. What was the Eastern Roman empire is now the Ottoman empire, possibly covertly ruled by the House of Hapsburg. Also, during the phantom time they invented Islam because they needed an enemy for the Christians to fight. And then after the Phantom time there were some crusades against Islam to cement this idea. </p>

<p>Over the course of the next few centuries, what was the group who plotted to usurp power from the Romans became the royal families of Europe. Also, charging interest was forbidden in the Christian religion so the Jews became the only bankers, and quickly gained power. </p>

<p>There were also tons of genocides during this time period (~30% of Europe was killed during the 1700&#39;s alone), possibly to get rid of any ideas that the middle ages never occured and the Roman empire fell very recently. </p>

<p>Also we began sailing to America and establishing worldwide powers right as the phantom time period ends.</p>

<p>I think Napoleon was not a part of this aristocracy, possibly knowing the truth about our past. Then TPTW (the powers that were, composed of the royal families and the top Jewish bankers) finally took him out, and continued their expansion across the world. The British lost America, so the Jewish bankers eventually moved the base of their operations to America, possibly establishing themselves in the Confederacy during the Civil War. After this happened, England slowly lost its grip on being a world power. </p>

<p>Then WWI and WWII happen and by the end America is a world power (who&#39;s only competition is communism), Europe is decimated and without any memory of the past, and the banksters have Israel back. </p>

<p>Also Hitler and Nazi Germany in general were very interested in the Romans. Maybe Hitler knew the truth and gained support for wanting to start the Roman empire over again. History is written by the victors.</p>

<p>Any world war conspiracies that you guys see fitting in this?</p>

<p>Then after all this it&#39;s your regular conspiracy theories of the Illuminati and the Bankers and the mafia and the CIA and who ever killing JFK and forming the current cabal. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s one possible version of our history, folks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That we are being spread false information, in the past was easy to hide information but now because the internet and cellphone is way to easy to enter in contract with other people.</p>

<p>So in this century is way more of spread false information, put the blame in others and invent events with this goal, to hide the truth, mostly because the population couldn&#39;t really handle something or shouldn&#39;t know others</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the war of approx. 1812 was waged against America to wipe the original 13th amendment out of the constitution. It was so the bank could install its Barristers into pulic office as to enslave us as subjects again. We basically let it happen because the 14th amendment enslaved is or at least subjugated us.  Lincoln was involved as well with the bankers I read somewhere that his entire past before he was president was made up and his real last name was Springstein. </p>
