<p>This article says loneliness is becoming Britain’s most lethal condition as 2.4 million adults say they suffer from chronic loneliness.</p>

<p>Why is this happening? Is it the smartphones? Is it the video games? Is it the porn and masturbation? Is it the breakdown of families? All of these societal ills are causing a lot of pain and loneliness and it’s clearly manufactured. </p>

<p>Do you notice this in your own life? Are your communities becoming less connected? Are people on the street less friendly and less willing to have a conversation? This is stuff I have noticed. </p>

<p>How to fix it? Is it even possible? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely the technology and endless in home entertainment. </p>

<p>Back in the day you would be bored as fuck at home so you had to go out for entertainment and would meet new people by default. </p>

<p>Also, everything is organized online so even social interaction is preplanned. Before the tech people were much more willing to talk to people they didn&#39;t know in public because that&#39;s how we actually met new people. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed where I live older people are more comfortable having a conversation off the cuff with a stranger because that&#39;s how they grew up. The only time I ever see younger people interacting in that way is when I&#39;m at a specialized event or show where they feel the people there must be ok because of the event they are attending.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s just where I live but I see way less social interaction in public now.  </p>

<p>I agree with you about older people being more comfortable having random conversations.</p>

<p>I also agree to an extent about your suggested cause (it is bhow they grew up).</p>

<p>However I would add another reason: they are more talkative in general because they are desperate for people to listen. The older you get, the less people pretend to care what you have to say.</p>

<p>lol, yes. I totally agree with that. Older you get, the less people you have to talk to because you have watched half of them die. All the more reason why 80 is my goldilocks death age. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not just that your friends have died. It is that people no longer pretend to care.</p>

<p>Listen to most conversations among people today. All pretense. People waiting for each other to shut up so they can talk.</p>

<p>As you get older, people spend less time pretending to care what you have to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, for sure. Mostly because a lot of people who you talk to on a daily basis are just trying to find out what you can do for them.

<p>I&#39;m amazed at how little interaction there is even among neighbors on the same street.  We can barely get 50% participation at the annual anti-crime block party.</p>

<p>There&#39;s one couple a few houses up the block we invent conspiracy theories about because you NEVER see them.  Their house appears  dark all the time and even though they have a decent deck and patio, they&#39;re never out there in the summer, either.  I think I&#39;ve talked to them maybe 3 times in 10 years.  I don&#39;t really think they&#39;re running a grow house or keeping slaves in the basement, but there are times where we don&#39;t see any activity for days and we start thinking &quot;murder suicide?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weird, hope there isn&#39;t anything nefarious going on. My neighborhood is the same way. Some people you just never see and it&#39;s pretty thickly settled. I&#39;ve tried to make an effort to get involved in community events like that because it&#39;s so important especially now. </p>

<p>I think a lot of the divisiveness is fed by the tech. It&#39;s a lot easier to hate a neighbor when you are arguing online with no actual contact than to carry that hatred over into meat space. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think there’s anything nefarious going on really, they’re a childless couple with well paying professional jobs who are just into their own thing.   That house had a purpose built home theater by the previous owner and the current owner is a major tech guy, so I suspect that when the house appears dark it’s because that’s where they are.  </p>

<p>I just think it’s weird not to befriend your immediate neighbors.  It’s the difference between “hey, there’s something going on at the Johnson’s house that’s not right, we should check it out/call the cops/etc” and nobody knowing or caring as your place burns down or gets robbed. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all of this. </p>

<p>I also believe it is manufactured, or said otherwise, there is an agenda to demolish all our traditional landmarks. That&#39;s what the NWO is about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you notice this in your own life? Are your communities becoming less connected? Are people on the street less friendly and less willing to have a conversation? This is stuff I have noticed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes. yes. yes and yes. There is also the fact that you are probably living in a big city. Big cities disconnect you from your roots. Every person is a stranger and is always late for whatever they have to do. This doesn&#39;t leave much room for sympathizing, connecting, making meaningful relationships, enjoying the present moment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How to fix it? Is it even possible? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>go to the Church. I&#39;m from a country traditionally Catholic. The republic was imposed to the people with lots of blood, and was about destroying the country&#39;s Catholic roots. I read it&#39;s the work of the freemasons, but I cannot comment more as I don&#39;t know much about all this freemasons stuff. Notice how the jews are well connected and are very much about their community. So are most muslims. BTW, i&#39;m gonna guess you are from a Christian &quot;background&quot; if I can phrase it that way. Officially, the government claims the republic is secular, however there is evidence there is a lot of collusion with some religious groups, and one small one in particular. The republic has been about deconstructing everything that Catholicism allowed : bring people together, bring order in people&#39;s life, etc...</p>

Serotonin puts animals in hibernation, basically a dormant state where you don&#39;t really care about anything and it&#39;s also known to impair learning. Here&#39;s the study showing that EMFs increase serotonin : <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25542888">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25542888</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think everything you listed are all huge factors to the loneliness/depression. But I think social media/smart phones is actually a much bigger contribution especially will be once the younger generation move into adult life (the ones who had iPhones and iPads since they were a toddler). Spending hours a day scrolling through superficial lives, aspiring to be like an edited Instagram model or obsessively &quot;following&quot; their favorite youtubers. The loneliness will kick in once the children/teens/adults realise they do not have a picturesque-all-smiles lifestyle, perfect instagram face and will likely never meet or be friends with their favorite internet star. Worshiping false idols will 100% of the time result in some form of loneliness. </p>

<p>Another thing I&#39;d like to add to your list is prescription medication I&#39;m sure most people here understand the impact it makes on peoples mental health. Not even just psychiatric meds either. For women, birth control. It&#39;s around 60% of women above age of 16 on birth control and MOST of them include the side effect of depression. That&#39;s a lot of people on a lot of drugs with a side effect of depression. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the above OP, and let&#39;s not forget that &quot;the real truth&quot; about far too many things that have steadily come to light and are continuing to come to light has put a serious damper on many people&#39;s lives, especially when it comes to who and what to trust. </p>

<p>Like the world around us, we&#39;re all on shaky ground and it&#39;s not easy for most to take that in stride. Too many grey days and not enough sunny ones to give us a lift and brighten our days both literally and figuratively.</p>

<p>Virtually everyone would like to have some good and true friends but they&#39;re few and far between and hard to come across. </p>

<p>In addition to having more lonely and alienated individuals we also have more shallow and superficial ones chasing after &quot;the good life&quot; which they&#39;ve been inculcated to believe comes from having plenty of money and buying and having only the most expensive things which is the only measure they have for how good anything is. </p>

<p>The kind of people they want for friends are quite simply people that appear to have a lot of money that they look up to and people who look up to them for just how well they appear to be doing and it&#39;s simply all about those appearances not any real substance... things like careers and being seen in only the best places and always having more important things to do and places to go that the rest of their lives completely revolve around.</p>

<p>I&#39;d hazard a guess that most of the regulars here are actually &quot;loners&quot; who&#39;ve learned to live with themselves and pursue their own interests without actually feeling lonely on anything but the odd occasion. </p>

<p>The type others begrudging respect but don&#39;t actually want to get too close to. Displays of intelligence or knowledge that others don&#39;t have has that effect on many people despite the fact that such displays are completely unintentional and simply the way most well adjusted loners typically are. </p>

<p>You have to see past all the artificiality of the world of human beings and remember that there&#39;s still a real and natural one that you&#39;re always connected to and never out of place in. </p>

<p>Things are in the shape they&#39;re in because humans have moved too far away from that real and natural world and the more they have the less real and natural they themselves have become.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because capitalism promote individuality.  You must have one of each product: House, phone, stove, etc. No one will talk to you because they want to know you, only buy you possessions. Toys, food, tatoo, clothes, etc.
The solution?</p>

<p>Not Communism. But a middle term between the two, like for example cohousing.</p>

<p>Why I even suggest this?
Humans evolve in cities, but before that we lived in small groups, placed houses side by side, eventualy this became a circle, and the house walls to the outside became... Better walls to protect. In this early stage there wasn&#39;t an oven to every one, humans shared an common space, the stove remained on almost all day. Many womans also worked togheter crushing grains. </p>

<p>All of this points to a pattern: interaction.
This is what is also missing from school. People aren&#39;t taught to interact with one another and how they should do it. How to participate in meaningful discussions. They are taught to follow orders, to make groups based on who shouts louder, and who has the best comeback (Like Trump). No critical thinking and extremist religiosity is what we are taught. And we are following them to our doom.</p>
