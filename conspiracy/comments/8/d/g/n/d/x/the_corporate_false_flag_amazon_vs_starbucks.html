        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Disclaimer: This is a theory I came up with two nights ago and IMO it makes perfect sense.  That being said it most likely isn&#39;t true or real (Trill) but it does have some merit when you look at all the facts.  If this has been discussed before I apologize.</p>

<p><strong>FACT</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Jeff Bezos is CEO of Amazon</li>
<li>Amazon secured $600 million deal with CIA for cloud computing service.</li>
<li>Jeff Bezos purchased Washington Post.</li>
<li>Wildly speculated WP through Bezos is Propaganda Arm of Deep State.</li>
<li>Amazon purchased Whole Foods.</li>
<li>Whole Foods &amp; Starbucks share target demographic.</li>
<li>Bezos owns coffee company called happy Belly and has shown major interest in entering Coffee market.</li>
<li>Top three food related items for Amazon are Coffee Related.</li>
<li>Washington Post has paywall for MAJORITY of articles but not for this coffee story. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/04/19/they-cant-be-here-for-us-black-men-arrested-at-starbucks-tell-their-story-for-the-first-time/?utm_term=.5cd29177e5ca">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/04/19/they-cant-be-here-for-us-black-men-arrested-at-starbucks-tell-their-story-for-the-first-time/?utm_term=.5cd29177e5ca</a></li>
<li>Almost immediately #RacistStarbucks starts trending.</li>
<li>Mass Media coverage of minor incident is almost unprecedented.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>OPINION</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The two black guys backstory is just too perfect.  Real estate developers that spent less than 5 minutes inside before asked to leave.  I&#39;m not saying the real estate developer story is unbelievable just pointing out how unlikely it is that this happens to two do good REAL ESTATE developers.  Last time I checked Real estate developer isn&#39;t a common career choice for 99% of Americans. </li>
<li>Video shown to public is just too perfect.  Video starts as Cops are arresting gentlemen.  Their business partner just happens to walk in as the arrest is taking place.  Commentary in video all speak on racial bias.</li>
<li>Manager who called cops is still anon. I would bet they have limited tenure at Starbucks.</li>
<li>Starbucks has image of typical white america.... Think White girl with uggs and Starbucks Latte thing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>THEORY</strong></p>

<p>Bezos, understanding Starbucks is Top Dog in coffee market uses deep state and media to create Corporate False Flag with sole intention of creating widespread perception Starbucks is racist in order to gain market share for his coffee venture. </p>

<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE</strong></p>

<p>At least this isn&#39;t MUH RUSSIANS or LIBTARDS are evil conspiracy.</p>

<p>Cohen said he and his clients suggested that along with Starbucks, they engage in a mediation with a retired federal judge in Philadelphia. Cohen said Starbucks agreed to that proposal, which necessitates that the conversations between executives and Nelson and Robinson remain confidential.</p>

<p>The AP reported that the men are in mediation proceedings with Starbucks to implement changes like the posting of a customer bill of rights in stores; </p>
