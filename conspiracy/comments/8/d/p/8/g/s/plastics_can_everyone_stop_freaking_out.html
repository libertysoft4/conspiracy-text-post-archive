    <div class="md"><p>You realize plastic is made from oil right?</p>

<p>The production of water bottles uses 17 million barrels of oil a year, and it takes three times the water to make the bottle as it does to fill it.</p>

<p>According to the Beverage Marketing Corporation, Americans bought a total of 31.2 billion liters of water in 2006, sold in bottles ranging from the 8-ounce aquapods popular in school lunches to the multi-gallon bottles found in family refrigerators and office water coolers. Most of this water was sold in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, requiring nearly 900,000 tons of the plastic. PET is produced from fossil fuels – typically natural gas and petroleum</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I agree with you, the plastic does nothing wrong if it&#39;s recycled through correct processes. What&#39;s wrong is the system and the people who do not recycle. I don&#39;t think your point was arguing whether it&#39;s good or bad to have plastic in our oceans or natural habitats, that is OBVIOUSLY bad for anyone with a mind to think. We all use and need plastic, it&#39;s a great material, but like usual humans are abusing the process and the system and creating destruction and blaming it on whatever product they use.</p>

There are hopeful developments with formulations that are less harmful and newly discovered bacteria which may break it down rather than release it in smaller and smaller particulates under the effects of abrasion and exposure to UV radiation. Recycling into building material and somehow encapsulating it would be an option. It can also be broken down, refined, into it&#39;s mostly petroleum based constituents.</p>
