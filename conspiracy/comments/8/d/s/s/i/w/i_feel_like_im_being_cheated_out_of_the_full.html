<p>You are totally right, though.  We have to deal with this shit and put a stop to it for the benefit of future generations.  I have relatives that fought in WW1 and WW2, and probably the other wars, so I am not complaining about dealing with this.  I know that you are not complaining either.  We all just became aware of something that we cannot ignore.  </p>

<p>What would your ideal life involve? Day to day, I mean. How do you imagine a better world?</p>

<p>After a few years of conspiracy &#39;research&#39;, I one day realised that I don&#39;t even know what the &#39;ideal&#39; world would look like.</p>

<p>I guess things changed for me when I realised just how utterly moronic the average normie really is.</p>

<p>Just give them daily tasks, some money to buy drugs and alcohol and shiny things, and they will be happy.</p>

<p>And then when you throw in the <a href="http://www.johnlebon.com/key-topics/cavendish-experiment/">unspoken myths</a>, it all becomes a tangled mess.</p>

<p>What I am getting at is, are things really so bad? Or is that our own minds making us feel like victims?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ideal world is one where rather than struggling and working tirelessly to afford food and clothing and bills and shelter, humans would be given those things at an EXCEPTIONALLY cheap price, due to robots and automation, giving humanity as a whole more FREE time to enjoy life and pursue the things that make them happy, notably artistic ventures such as painting, making music, wood working, etc. When you&#39;re not worried about how to get food on your plate, or how to pay rent, then the stress of that search is obliterated and the spirit is freed up to do what serves itself best, which is the fulfillment of dreams. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m torn between agreeing with you and disagreeing. 
When humans have to work together for resources or to achieve a greater common goal they are happier and better adjusted emotionally. When faced with having too much time on their schedule they seek stimulation through petty conflicts and seek drama to replace the experience of being out in the wild. If left to their own devices people who aren&#39;t driven to achieve a goal will not work towards something positive. In short, most people can&#39;t handle the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the real ideal world would be one where we just embraced our animal side and try to live more naturally. No marriage controlled by some government or church - just be together if you want to with anyone and everyone (as in open relationships/multiple partners - no reason to pretend that all humans are all about monogamy), no one is forced to wear clothes, a small governing body and everyone living in small communities etc.</p>

<p>Modern life is super toxic and depressing. Everyone pretends to be something they&#39;re not, down to the smallest of things when we all just want to relax and be real. We should still punish bad people and &quot;crimes&quot;, but it should be less about lawyers and lawsuits and more about the actual truth. People should be free to trust their gut instinct.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is that modern western culture is plastic and fake from the inside out. Everything is made into a product to make money and that money is used to keep everyone dependent on those same products. Money isn&#39;t money, it&#39;s a control mechanism. Capital, literally. To keep people in a hamster wheel that eats our spirit (as in happiness, not the mystical kind).</p>

<p>Everyone just wants to feel like they&#39;re not being stalked by their phones and billboards with hidden cameras that record our reactions and expressions into a database for advertising to make more money to create more phones that record us and billboards that have hidden cameras that spy on us to make more money so that we can have more advanced phones that spy our every move even more effectively so that they can make more money to make better billboards and then also use that money to bribe people or make them sell out their friends who might be harming the making of money and phones that spy on us--</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  Bit chilly indeed.  Gotta learn to be chilly though - to live and function and succeed through and in spite of the chilliness.  That&#39;s part of how we learn and grow and become and even greater and more evolved and advanced human in the first place.  You don&#39;t just jump from kindergarten to college, do you?  No.  You have to evolve slowly - go through all the classes...and a lot of those grades <em>suck</em>.  A lot of school <em>sucks</em>.  However, one would be well advised to not drop out and to experience as much of this &quot;human school&quot; as possible.  Part of having the &quot;full school/human experience&quot; involves often having extremely shitty classes and extremely shitty teachers.</p>

<p>Gotta keep fighting and come out of it on the other side.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not being robbed.  Part of your learning - all of our learning - involves experiencing the bullshit we&#39;re presently going through.</p>

<p>Definitely shitty, to be sure - these classes definitely suck as far as I&#39;m concerned - but the sooner we get through them and get them done and over with and learn from them, the sooner we can move on to the next, more evolved set of learning and classes.</p>

<p>But you didn’t link the rest of what I said, which was the most important part.  Part of our learning is <em>what?</em> Part of our learning is EVOLVING THROUGH the difficulties we face.</p>

<p>In none of that is there any mention of “taking it like a compliant slave.”</p>

<p>Part of evolving through the difficulties might involve fighting off negative individuals and figures.  Part of it involves zen and rising above figures that attempt harm, yes, but sometimes other parts of it involve fighting and possibly killing those figures.</p>

<p>But never ever - whether one is zen or actively, physically fighting - is doing nothing at all ever recommended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s this meme I see floated from time to time, usually in conversations such as this one, that goes something like &quot;this reality is like a school to train our consciousness in preparation for higher levels of reality, and the reason we face so many easily remedied hardships created by the elite control class is their desire to kick-start our evolution so that we can &quot;get there&quot; faster&quot;.</p>

<p>I dig that what I quoted out above isn&#39;t nessesarily the same thing you are saying.</p>

<p>What I mean by &quot;propagated by the black lodge&quot; is that I think this meme was pushed by that same &quot;elite control class&quot; to get people to focus on themselves, their journey, and largely ignore the fact that we are all in this together. We aren&#39;t getting out of this energy farm unless we do it together.</p>

<p>But you can’t ignore that we are all in this together if you understand that the only way to overcome what the elite are going on this planet is to all come together and fight together through the problems they created and that we ignorantly allow.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  That’s the whole point, and there’s no way we can overcome any of this if we don’t do it all together.</p>

<p>We’re not disagreeing actually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a bit tricky since there&#39;s no direct concept of &quot;shopping cart&quot; in Latin, but I&#39;ll give it a shot lol.</p>

<p>&quot;Retribui cartallus&quot;</p>

<p>Cartallus is the word for &quot;basket&quot; which would be the closest idea to a shopping cart, and Retribuo is the idea of giving back or recompense, as opposed to the verb Redeo, which means to personally return somewhere. So, using the perfect form of Retribuo, which is Retribui, the phrase I just made says: &quot;I returned the basket&quot;. </p>

<p>My friend’s dad was a “conspiracy nut”. No such thing as the internet; he had to scrabble his alternative news from all over, and built a huge CB antennae to be able to chat with like-minded folks. He even got a visit from the FBI for checking out too many books about Tesla from the library.</p>

<p>Whereas here I am, casually reading all your gentlefolks’ discussion about exacly what I was just feeling yesterday after having burrowed through Alterwelt’s entire <a href="https://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2702754/pg1">Remote Viewing thread</a> and pondering just how much is hidden from us.</p>

<p>Compared to him, only one generation back, we have so much more available to us - particularly community. As cliche as it is, it’s the sentiment in “The Matrix” - that you can’t put your finger on it, but something is not right, and nobody around you seems to see it. </p>

<p>Even though I get sent down the rathole about Atlantis or whatever from reading this stuff, it’s nice to know I’m not alone, and not crazy, in thinking some things just don’t add up. Cuz I watched “<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center">the pancake effect</a>” live on TV when it happened - twice in a row when even once seemed like a miracle - and I can tell you I felt really lonely in thinking that explanation was horseshit.</p>

<p>Two men is suits with badges came in, sat on their couch and politely asked him why he was so interested in Tesla’s inventions, and about his political leanings. He had this massive, barely legal CB antenna too (which he powered illegally from time to time), so he fit a certain profile. They asked him this question a number of different ways, and recited which books he had checked out and when. He asked how they got that information, and they refused to say. He asked if he should have a lawyer present, and they said “You can, but that won’t help your case.” Eventually they left and he never heard from them again, but it scared the shit out of his wife.</p>

<p>It was definitely the “government is bigger than you and don’t give a damn about you” story of my youth. I’ll grant it’s got no proof behind it, but I never questioned its authenticity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know how you feel. But, by the same token, so much information is out there. Just being on the internet gives you so much knowledge- there are vasts amounts of knowledge and skills that you can learn for the price of an internet connection and a few hours of your time.</p>

<p>Time is very important, and I&#39;ve re-structured my life around quite a bit around how I spend my time- how much do I watch tv? Play video games? Go out with friends? Ready? Learn a new skill? Work? Travel to work? Visit family? Sleep? Am I really doing the things that will help me advance my own &quot;human experience&quot;?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve worked jobs with friends that taught themselves programming, started their own businesses, and are now living financially independent lives while I am driving to and from my 9-6 every day. </p>

<p>I know people who sold all their stuff, and moved across the country to set up a new life in a totally different city. Some of them hit it big, some sold all their stuff and moved back with a bunch of experiences.</p>

<p>Math, science, art, music, physical experiences... the ability to do them happens almost every day. You need to DO them. Spiritually there are still teachers out there teaching meditation and methods of self help and self improvement.</p>

<p>Yes, there are some people who don&#39;t have the health, the wealth, the time, to take advantage of all of this. They might be disabled, they might be in debt, they might have family responsibilities. </p>

<p>But at the same time, when I started cutting things out of my life- not watching any tv during the week, for instance, I realized how many hours I spent doing nothing. When I stopped buying drinks when I &quot;went out&quot; with my friends, I realized how much money I was frittering away.</p>

<p>There&#39;s still a lot of room to enjoy the human experience on this planet. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think we&#39;re becoming a prison planet more and more every day. But we aren&#39;t there yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Say we started a small country somewhere. The people who have accessed Enlightenment on a permanent basis are so few and fair between, and those that have often times care less for starting a society (because of transcendence) outside of teaching others in a smaller (Monastery) community how to access enlightenment.</p>

<p>But lets just say you convince enough Yogis/Masters/Christs to do something like this. Its still going to take a shitload of time to put forth the rules, regulations, infrastructure, trade, Gov, education, etc to run the thing, and if you start thriving and growing, then the Globalist Psycho controllers will soon invade you when they see you are not connected to the World Fed Bank system. This is why Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and Now Syria all got invaded was because these places had their own gold and own independent banking/economies not plugged into the Beast.</p>

<p>There are soooooooo many factors involved in this, its not as simple as &quot;Have everybody practice X to reach enlightenment and then we will have Utopia.&quot; Certain souls are too immature, too underdeveloped to even be able to understand disconnecting from ego, one pointed concentration, love, humbleness, selflessness, etc. Many or most souls need bread crumbs and to just learn to read and be civilized before even entering into the higher things</p>

<p>thing is, gangs still want to kill each other, drug addicts still want their fix, pushers still want their money, big pharma still wants its power, ad infinitum. We&#39;re going to need to reach some post industrial era where all of the above is minimized.</p>

<p>Another thing is that you can find some interesting socialist experiments in some of Scandinavian countries (and China&#39;s Silicone valley called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY&amp;amp;t=1s">Shenzhen</a> ) where people reach a state of being able to start Universal Basic Income trials, relatively peaceful, prosperous, etc.....but guess what? There is a level of homogeneity via race, and all of that get disrupted when this one element changes (See Sweden rape and crime epidemic after bringing in millions of 3rd world economic migrants who came to take advantage and 90% remain always on Gov handouts)</p>

<p>There are so many issues, imbalance, complexities, geopolitics, etc that wont allow us to to get to where we know we should be living life: Utopia, abundance, peace, Enlightenment, balance</p>

<p>Not saying we <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> fight them; we absolutely should! But use this as an opportunity to grow. Indeed I think that&#39;s the whole point of Kali Yuga.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too much of what we see, is about conservative push for the win for us and not for &quot;them&quot;. It&#39;s childish but dominates much of politics and establishment think atm.</p>

<p>The win-win is not the same as a draw. The thought that we must &quot;win&quot; first and that others should not, is very limiting. There are many real world situations in which a win-win is the only out.. but we can&#39;t let the others win, so m.a.d.ness prevails.</p>

<p>Putting the other down I wonder stems in part from insecurity, which perhaps accounts for a lot of America&#39;s problems and behaviour.</p>

<p>It would be nice to have our lives back. </p>

<p>What would your ideal life involve? Day to day, I mean. How do you imagine a better world?</p>

<p>After a few years of conspiracy &#39;research&#39;, I one day realised that I don&#39;t even know what the &#39;ideal&#39; world would look like.</p>

<p>I guess things changed for me when I realised just how utterly moronic the average normie really is.</p>

<p>Just give them daily tasks, some money to buy drugs and alcohol and shiny things, and they will be happy.</p>

<p>And then when you throw in the <a href="http://www.johnlebon.com/key-topics/cavendish-experiment/">unspoken myths</a>, it all becomes a tangled mess.</p>

<p>What I am getting at is, are things really so bad? Or is that our own minds making us feel like victims?</p>
