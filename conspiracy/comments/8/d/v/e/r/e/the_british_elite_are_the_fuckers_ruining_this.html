        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>~This post is pure speculation on my part~</p>

<p>Without diving too deep into the rabbit hole, I believe the British Elite are the ones to blame for the worlds problems at hand. They let their problem child (the USA) do all the dirty work for them while they sit quietly on their island surrounded by their minions (the EU). Their spies have infiltrated all parts of our government, and they have successfully created many boogeyman(ISIS, theRuskis, Communism) to keep our dumbass population from looking their way. But finally we are seeing a push back from many world powers to trap the British in their own fucking game. </p>

<p>It&#39;s as simple as being on one of two teams: the Illumanati or the Free Masons. One vies to control the world while the other vies to free it from the others grasp. This game has been going on since the crusades when many brave men sought to bring Christendom to the world. George Washington warned us about the two party system many years ago and now we are finally seeing that he was absolutely fucking right. When your two options for president are Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, you should start being skeptical of whoever has their hand in the fucking pot. </p>

<p>So this is a Fuck YOU to the British Government. To every Elite bastard in the world who falls at hand to them to save their own ass, and a giant fucking wake up call to the United States of America to start going after the real fucking culprits. I ahve spent way too long pointing my own finger at the US but now Im ready to jump across the fucking pond and chop the head off the beast who started all this shit. No more world wars, no more smoke and mirrors. The US military forces are chomping at the bit to find the one who really started this mess after we wasted too many god damn lives fighting a god damn ghost. </p>

<p>So come on with it UK, its your move.</p>

<p>Theyre the only government not involved with this shit going on the world right now. How does the worlds most recent largest empire just so &quot;nah, were done ruling the world, here you go US&quot;????
They have the UN white hats at their disposal to try and control the narrative but we saw how well that worked this past week. I&#39;m not one to scream shill but without a proper response I have reason to believe your just another Brit sucking the Empire&#39;s dick somewhere in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Following this line of thought, what do think happened to Nazi Germany? All of the smart ones get split up between the Axis powers and it&#39;s not like the Nazis ideas have vanished from society. I see Germany more prevalent than ever, they control the EU and have plenty of cronies in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck off dickhead. Every time someone doesn’t agree with something on this sub (which I love) they are called a shill.</p>

<p>I’m sure the English still have their fingers in lots of pies.  To create an empire they were treacherous cunts, and taught the US lot’s of lessons which they know and use today.</p>

<p>However, the facts are that the English lost a generation in WW1 and were bankrupt after WW2.  They not only lost their empire, but their position as THE world superpower (in reality relegated to third), and the US have clearly dictated policy since.  Particular examples include the creation of Israel and the Suez canal.  </p>

<p>To believe the Queen or some other British aristocratic rules the world is clearly ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure what you mean by back track.  </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s as simple as being on one of two teams: the Illumanati or the Free Masons.&quot;  The Illuminati, Freemasons, Rosicurians, Jesuits, Vatican, etc. are all interrelated.  For example, Freemasonry is essentially the Vatican/Jesuit/Catholic arm of the Protestant church.   </p>

<p>It seems to me that the U.S. won independence in the Revolutionary War, but then the losers slowly crept back in and took control.  This is why the U.S. is a corporation owned and controlled by the City of London and Vatican City.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything your saying man. I was just trying to keep it simple for the layman. I chose to highlight two factions that most people are familiar with just to get them to start thinking. Yes, all the factions are interrelated but I have reason to believe that there were always good guys trying to bring down the bad guys. The free masons were trying to free humanity at some point while the Illumanite were trying to play god like they&#39;ve always wanted too. The Rabbit HOle goes deep AF but I think you know that. My comment was more geared toward shills who try and hide from intellectual conversation. You seem like a well informed person which is actually a breath of fresh air.</p>
