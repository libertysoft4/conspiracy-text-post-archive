<p>If what you post online is deemed &quot;grossly offensive&quot; by any random person that wants to censor your expression, you&#39;re in some shit. </p>

<p>It won&#39;t be long before expressing 9/11 truth or talking about False Flag Operations is punishable simply because someone finds it offensive.  This is regoddamndiculous and simply must not be allowed to prosper as an institutional protocol. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chelsea Russell, 19, from Liverpool posted the lyric from Snap Dogg&#39;s &#39;I&#39;m Trippin&#39;&#39; to pay tribute to a boy who died in a road crash, a court heard.</p>

<p>Russell argued it was not offensive, but was handed a community order.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said her sentence was increased from a fine to a community order &quot;as it was a hate crime&quot;.</p>

<p>She was charged after Merseyside Police were anonymously sent a screenshot of her update. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Russell was found guilty of sending a grossly offensive message by a public communication.</p>

<p>She was given an eight-week community order, placed on an eight-week curfew and told to pay costs of £500 and an £85 victim surcharge.</p>

<p>WTF</p>

<p>I posted a few weeks ago about how the London police had a firm definition of thought crime posted on their website.  The normal naysayers cruised through and made fun,  saying things were being blown out of proportion.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/85iwk3/the_london_police_now_have_a_firm_definition_of/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/85iwk3/the_london_police_now_have_a_firm_definition_of/</a></p>

<p>Well,  here it is.  </p>

<p>Kid gets in <strong>legal trouble</strong> merely for posting Snoop Dogg lyrics because a single person took offense. </p>

<p>We have gone over the edge of the slippery  slope, and we&#39;re all fucking covered in grease. </p>

<p>Every single comment made against the establishment on a public forum such as this can be found to be &quot;grossly offensive&quot;, especially to the uneducated masses. </p>

<p>*Haha! Gotta love the immediate downvotes,  dealt out before it&#39;s even possible to read the post.  &lt;3</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DI is still Alex Jonesey, he gets all the airtime he wants now and is not harassed in the way some people who have real information do.  He talks about Lizard people and that&#39;s what keeps him in the limelight.  They want and need him there so you and I can be associated with him.  No traction, no progress made in waking people up from the real misinformation being spoon fed to them.  No investigations into 9/11 and Sandy Hook because you probably beleive in lizard people or flat earth.  </p>

<p>You have to be able to separate yourself and in the end when you have the attention of enough people, if that friggin lizard idea turns out to be true, it will speak for itself.  No need to carry it all along with the real evidence of thermite in the dust, or FEMA keystone community events being held.  It only serves to make sure people disregard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mistake she made was posting online, using an account that can be tied to a real person.</p>

<p>Every 6 month refresh your accounts and usernames on any and all social websites. Never use two passwords or similar usernames on the same forum and avoid at all costs using the same usernames across different forums and sites.</p>

<p>Avoid posting on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook unless you use fake details. </p>

<p>Yes, they can trace you easily by using your IP, but in the UK that requires the prosecution to jump through more legal loopholes. </p>

<p>Can&#39;t wait for this system to be abused though, it&#39;s going to be great seeing loads of people sent to jail for expressing their PERSONAL OPINION ON THE FUCKING INTERNET. Yes, that is CAPS!1!11!! How far has humanity fallen where text on a fucking screen can offend people.</p>

<p>Pull the fucking plug on the WWW for the sake of humanity, PLEASE!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t always enough</p>

<p>I live in Estonia. I use my non-legal name in Discord and don&#39;t post much personal information there(selfies, age, country of origin, some details from life but nothing that&#39;d be too easy to identify IMO). During a certain period of my life, I joked on public Discord server about shooting down my school and expressed suicidal thoughts.</p>

<p>My teachers got a call from police that night and my mother was called to school. According to them, I was lucky to not have police burst into my house. It hasn&#39;t been brought up later, but after that incident I didn&#39;t feel safe speaking to online friends even in private for a long time - even if I trusted them.</p>

<p>Use VPN, my dudes.</p>

<p>(For anyone curious, I&#39;m doing much better now. Don&#39;t be afraid to reach for help if thoughts like this overwhelm you.)</p>

<p>That would be an option, yes. Ideally you&#39;d have everyone rallying behind defending their rights in a violent rebellion against unconstitutional laws and injustice. You can guarantee foreign governments would be helping the rebellion, and there would be rogue factions of the military willing to pitch in as well, so long as the people are armed and capable of forming an organized insurrection militia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t really constructive to analyze history in terms of what we believe a political act was intended for. It&#39;s impossible to discern such a thing now, let alone 200 years ago. What we can do is demonstrate what a piece of legislation allows for, and the consequences of the legislation. The seditions part of the aliens and seditions act made it illegal to criticize the government with false allegations. If you were accused of such a thing, you could use truth as your defense. The biggest legal problem here is that our justice system presumes that one is innocent until proven guilty, however you can&#39;t prove that someone is guilty of not speaking the truth. Specifically, the only argument for proving a negative in this situation is asserting absence of evidence, but absence of evidence in a justice system where the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty essentially shifts the burden of proof from the prosecutor to the accused, resulting in the opposite-guilty until proven innocent. It would be up to the defendant to prove that they are not making a false claim about the government by providing evidence for the truth of their claims. When this comes down to criticisms of policy, you can imagine how this might be particularly problematic. There&#39;s a lot to touch on here, but I recommend studying about the early American politics of federalists versus anti-federalists. The alien and seditions act was passed by a majority federalist Congress and signed off by a federalist president. They did not even want Americans to have the bill of rights. The political result of the act was Jeffersonian anti-federalists/Democrat-republicans being accused and convicted, essentially imprisoned for holding political views contrary to the state.</p>

The people would win, it would be bloody, and we would probably replace the government with a temporary fascist state in the wake of the chaos that may or may not return to a more representative government.

<p>America is the most free country on the planet. Compared to every other country, America has way more rights.</p>

<p>Your media is literally just as fucked. Always see some shitty UK media site with obvious clickbait titles. independent, dailymail, theguardian, mirror, and express are all straight fake news.</p>

<p>Very ignorant to think that your country isn&#39;t fucked either.</p>

<p>Oh Those Embarrassing Moments: Atlantic Council&#39;s Ben Nimmo Outs &#39;Russian Bot&#39; That Turns Out To Simply Be A UK Citizen Tired Of UK Government Warmongering</p>

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/news/@clarityofsignal/oh-those-embarrassing-moments-atlantic-council-s-ben-nimmo-outs-russian-bot-that-turns-out-to-simply-be-a-uk-citizen-tired-of-uk">https://steemit.com/news/@clarityofsignal/oh-those-embarrassing-moments-atlantic-council-s-ben-nimmo-outs-russian-bot-that-turns-out-to-simply-be-a-uk-citizen-tired-of-uk</a></p>

<p>For the past few months, Ben Nimmo, the head of the Atlantic Council&#39;s Digital Forensic Research Labs has had his eye on one Twitter account in particular and he has relentlessly framed that account as being that of an influential &quot;Russian bot&quot; that is linked to the Kremlin. This post will reveal that the Atlantic Council&#39;s Ben Nimmo has displayed utter incompetency and a shameful display of research (or lack thereof), considering his position as head of DFR Lab, and considering the large amount of money that the Atlantic Council receives and spends on supposedly &#39;countering&#39; disinfo (to be read as acting as &quot;Thought Police&quot;) for the global elitist establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re right on the net Brits get all stuffy about guns. It’s like we are better than others because the government doesn’t think us grown up enough to use them, that is just crazy and righteous. As it happens s I’m in the uk and do own a gun but that aside I see no need to get uppity about it. What they fail to realise most Swiss homes have guns and they are far better off that we are. As do many Swedish and Finnish homes. </p>

<p>Our guns were taken away in the 1930s because the government was afraid of an armed revolution. And they had reason to be as well. Now it’s because of our own health and safety we can’t have them. Load of bollocks. </p>

<p>I find it daft that Brits brag about not being trusted with guns when in fact they have no idea what they are talking about half the time. Still you lot got to stop shooting each other as much as you do. But hey that’s the world we live in these days </p>

    <div class="md"><p>DI is still Alex Jonesey, he gets all the airtime he wants now and is not harassed in the way some people who have real information do.  He talks about Lizard people and that&#39;s what keeps him in the limelight.  They want and need him there so you and I can be associated with him.  No traction, no progress made in waking people up from the real misinformation being spoon fed to them.  No investigations into 9/11 and Sandy Hook because you probably beleive in lizard people or flat earth.  </p>

<p>You have to be able to separate yourself and in the end when you have the attention of enough people, if that friggin lizard idea turns out to be true, it will speak for itself.  No need to carry it all along with the real evidence of thermite in the dust, or FEMA keystone community events being held.  It only serves to make sure people disregard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was that police arrest people all the time to be slaves in prison for things like drug addiction and yet they get away with it even though we all have guns. The ones who die in a firefight as you put it are dead, and the rest are arrested and imprisoned. Go ahead and shoot at the cops right the next time they harass you. You&#39;d die and they&#39;d still be collecting slaves before the evening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t really constructive to analyze history in terms of what we believe a political act was intended for. It&#39;s impossible to discern such a thing now, let alone 200 years ago. What we can do is demonstrate what a piece of legislation allows for, and the consequences of the legislation. The seditions part of the aliens and seditions act made it illegal to criticize the government with false allegations. If you were accused of such a thing, you could use truth as your defense. The biggest legal problem here is that our justice system presumes that one is innocent until proven guilty, however you can&#39;t prove that someone is guilty of not speaking the truth. Specifically, the only argument for proving a negative in this situation is asserting absence of evidence, but absence of evidence in a justice system where the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty essentially shifts the burden of proof from the prosecutor to the accused, resulting in the opposite-guilty until proven innocent. It would be up to the defendant to prove that they are not making a false claim about the government by providing evidence for the truth of their claims. When this comes down to criticisms of policy, you can imagine how this might be particularly problematic. There&#39;s a lot to touch on here, but I recommend studying about the early American politics of federalists versus anti-federalists. The alien and seditions act was passed by a majority federalist Congress and signed off by a federalist president. They did not even want Americans to have the bill of rights. The political result of the act was Jeffersonian anti-federalists/Democrat-republicans being accused and convicted, essentially imprisoned for holding political views contrary to the state.</p>
