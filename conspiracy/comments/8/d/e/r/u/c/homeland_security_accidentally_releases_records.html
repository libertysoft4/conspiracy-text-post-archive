        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-04-19 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ShellOilNigeria.html">ShellOilNigeria</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2018/apr/18/fusion-center-em/">https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2018/apr/18/fusion-center-em/</a></p>

<p>When you send thousands of FOIA requests, you are bound to get some very weird responses from time to time. Recently, we here at MuckRock had one of our most bizarre gets yet - Washington State Fusion Center’s accidental release of records on the effects of remote mind control.</p>

<p>As part of my ongoing project looking at fusion centers’ investigations into Antifa and various white supremacist groups, I filed a request with the WSFC. I got back many standard documents in response, including emails, intelligence briefings and bulletins, reposts from other fusion centers - and then there was one file titled “EM effects on human body.zip.”</p>

<p>Hmmm. What could that be? What does EM stand for and what is it doing to the human body? So I opened it up and took a look:</p>

<p>Hell yeah, dude.</p>

<p>EM stands for electromagnetic. What you are looking at here is “psycho-electronic” weapons that purportedly use electromagnetism to do a wide variety of horrible things to people, such as reading or writing your mind, causing intense pain, “rigor mortis,” or most heinous of all, itching.</p>

<p>Now to be clear, the presence of these records (which were not created by the fusion center, and are not government documents) should not be seen as evidence that DHS possesses these devices, or even that such devices actually exist. Which is kind of unfortunate because “microwave hearing” is a pretty cool line of technobabble to say out loud.</p>

<p>ou know what’s even cooler? “Remote Brain Mapping.” It is insanely cool to say. Go ahead. Say it. Remote. Brain. Mapping.</p>

<p>Just check the detail on these slides too. The black helicopter shooting off its psychotronic weapons, mapping your brain, broadcasting your thoughts back to some fusion center. I wish their example of “ELF Brain stimulation” was a little clearer though.</p>

<p>It’s difficult to source exactly where these images come from, but it’s obviously not government material. One seems to come from a person named “Supratik Saha,” who is identified as a software engineer, the brain mapping slide has no sourcing, and the image of the body being assaulted by psychotronic weapons is sourced from raven1.net, who apparently didn’t renew their domain.</p>

<p>It’s entirely unclear how this ended up in this release. It could have been meant for another release, it could have been gathered for an upcoming WSFC report, or it could even be from the personal files of an intelligence officer that somehow got mixed up in the release. A call to the WSFC went unreturned as of press time, so until we hear back, their presence remains a mystery.</p>

<p>We’ll keep you updated once we hear back, and you can download the files yourself on the request page.</p>

Raven1.net was active from 1996 until around 2010 and was probably the Web&#39;s first clearinghouse for information pertaining to the microwave voice phenomena - an important point, and the reason it is preserved here. Ms. White&#39;s personal quest to assemble a complete body of information on such subjects lead to both original research which remains relevant today as well as to the credulous representation of talking points from such figures as Ira Einhorn and Lyndon LaRouche. Any judgement on the veracity of Ms. White&#39;s claims is probably best left to the reader. Raven1.net is offered here for posterity since it has been excluded from the Wayback Machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This device does not control my thinking. However, all of my thoughts are broadcast to them. They can cause me to feel some pain in my hip and feet. They also occasionally try to make me feel sick to my stomach, but because it has been going on for 10 years and I know it&#39;s them, I also know that it is not real and will pass. I have Mexican friend who had this too, and he told me that &quot;they tried to make me think I was crazy.&quot; That&#39;s what they do. Also, because they hear all my thoughts, they know all my email and other passwords. I had a notice on my Gmail account some years ago that my email was being filtered through another Gmail account. They know everything about me, but I don&#39;t care. My goal is to get this out in the open and have the government admit to it, so others won&#39;t suffer. Also, because I have had 10 years to think about this, there are some benefits to being cyborg. That&#39;s where I would like to put some effort. I wish some legitimate journalist would take this seriously enough to investigate what I know because I know who these people are for the most part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have one of these devices in my head. I have experienced all of the things on the graphic that accompanies the article. I have been trying to get someone to believe me about this for over 10 years. The people who put this in me claim to be with the Temple of Set, which was headed by Michael Aquino who was in the DoD PsychOps and they said it is a wire about 1/2 inch long behind my left ear. After I show this to my doctor, I hope he will refer me for an X-ray. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was living on a friend&#39;s property in a village in Los Cabos, Mexico. The son of the guy whose property I was living on is a member of the Temple of Set, a satanist group. Their leader, Michael Aquino, was in the U.S. Army&#39;s PsychOps division, and he got these somehow. I have a Mexican friend who had this done to him too, only a year before it happened to me. He was a friend of the satanist son. They got drugs in our drink somehow and put this in when we were knocked out. My Mexican friend kept saying to me &quot;don&#39;t you hear the voices?&quot; Then it happened to me too. I&#39;m so happy this has come out because maybe I can get it turned off for me and the others who&#39;ve had this done to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, I&#39;m just a stranger on the internet, but have you considered that you might be hearing voices as a natural part of your brain&#39;s &quot;wiring&quot;?</p>

<p>I know you&#39;re thinking &quot;this guy is saying I have schizophrenia&quot;, and you&#39;re right.  But I&#39;m not using that word because I think it has been demonized and stigmatized.</p>

<p>In other cultures, African ones for instance, hearing voices is not considered a negative thing.  As a result, the voices are generally positive or neutral -- as opposed to negative in American culture.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m really saying is, could it be that you&#39;re just experiencing the onset of a naturally-occuring mental condition?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish this was not real, but it is. I know who these people are. I also can interrupt their broadcast by running a vacuum cleaner or just a hair dryer. That kind of white noise interrupts the broadcast of my thoughts to them. Your reaction, by the way, is what I&#39;ve heard for over 10 years. I&#39;ve been to doctors and psychologists about it. With the release of this information, though, I think I can get my doctor to recommend an X-ray of the area where I know the device is. This is a device developed by the U.S. Department of Defense and the information was released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It is real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that it isn&#39;t real.  I&#39;m asking if you would consider the possibility that the cause of your voice is not the US govt, but a natural function of your brain?</p>

<p>Have you tried quieting the voices with non-electronic white noise?  For instance, crinkling a newspaper or plastic wrapper?  If that works, then that is good evidence that the voices are quieted by noise only because your mind is distracted by loud noise.</p>

<p>Also, please read the source of this website carefully.  The claims of &quot;remote mind control&quot; are not coming directly from the DHS, but from a random website called raven1.net included in a bulk data dump by the DHS.</p>

<p>Remember, DHS are the surveillance guys.  They probably have an automated system storing data on all sorts of random websites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This program comes from the DoD, not the DHS. Michael Aquino, the former head of the Temple of Set (a satanist group) and who worked in the Army&#39;s PsychOps division for many years, acquired these and gave them to people in his group, although I don&#39;t think the whole membership of the Temple of Set knows about it. It is very real. One of the people who I have been told has one of these is Diana Napolis, a woman who is considered an enemy by Michael Aquino because she tried for years to prove he is a child molester. She is supposedly crazy, but one of the people who do this to me told me that Diana was his first assignment. This is not delusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had an MRI but it showed nothing. This was inserted behind my left ear and is supposedly (according to the people who did this) a wire about a half inch long. I sent this article to my doctor who now wants to talk about an X-ray. I know where they should look now. According to my tormentors, they have 25 people with these and one of them is Philip Garrido, the man who kept Jaycee Dugard captive. If you remember, he said he heard voices too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had something similar to your experience. When I was a kid, around 11 or so, I remember waking up and this white light beaming into my room. I was scared shit less, then I saw two shadows walking towards my front door (I was sleeping on the couch that night). As soon as they opened the door, I lost consciousness. Ever since then, maybe once a month, before I fell asleep I&#39;d get the feeling I was being sucked down a black hole, sometimes me ending up in an Astral projection where I&#39;d see two spirits at my front door. I did a lot of work spiritually to get rid of the shit, and it took years of effort but now I&#39;m clear of whatever the fuck was fucking with me. I wonder if you could do the same with the DoD mind implant? </p>
