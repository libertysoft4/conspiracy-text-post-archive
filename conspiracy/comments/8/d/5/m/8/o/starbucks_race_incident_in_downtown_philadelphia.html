<p>Yes, yes.  He said, she said and they was good boys... I get it, but you still have not answered my very simple question:</p>

<p>Did they also demand access to the restroom and then refuse to leave when told the restrooms were for use only by customers?  That&#39;s an important detail that you seem eager to overlook.</p>

<p>Actually, answer my first question before that one.</p>

<p>How long were they in the store before they were asked to leave?</p>

<p>You can read the store manager&#39;s mind across the internet psychically across spacetime, but don&#39;t appear to know even the most basic fact about the situation. </p>

<p>I will say that I&#39;m also white and have been asked to leave a Starbucks for hanging out.   It was a crowded one in a downtown setting.  I didn&#39;t even demand access to the bathroom. </p>

<p>Yes, there are videos. I&#39;m too busy to look for it myself, but just google search around and you&#39;ll find them.</p>

<p>From what I remember as soon as they asked to use the bathroom. </p>

<p>Yes, yes. He said, she said and they was good boys... I get it</p>

<p>Except it&#39;s actual witnesses to the incident. Google for interviews of those who were there, and look at the videos of the incident as it was happening. People were speaking out as it was going on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How long were they in the store before they were asked to leave?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Already answered your question. They came in, asked to use the bathroom, and were told to get out. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did they also demand access to the restroom and then refuse to leave when told the restrooms were for use only by customers? That&#39;s an important detail that you seem eager to overlook.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and other witnesses said that the other people in the starbucks were doing the same thing but had no problem. Why were other people inside the store allowed to &quot;loiter&quot; but they couldn&#39;t? The only obvious difference is the color of their skin. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How long were they in the store before they were asked to leave?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re asking this question again, when you already asked it in the same comment. </p>

<p>Yep, and that&#39;s why anecdotal evidence is weak. Everyone has their own personal experiences and it&#39;s quite easy to lie about or not believe the other person. </p>

<p>Not of this part of the encounter.  You&#39;re not &quot;too bust to look it up.&quot;  Look at the wall of text you had to type out in respinse.</p>

<p>You have seen no such video, you know this, but you would rather lie about how bust you are than just cop to the truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Already answered your question. </p>

<p>No, you haven&#39;t.   All you&#39;ve done is repeat the &quot;victim&#39;s narrative.&quot;  Eatch, rather than answer my question, you did it again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They came in, asked to use the bathroom, and were told to get out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re attempting to compress a larger period of time into a twenty second interaction.  But that&#39;s not what happened.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re asking this question again, when you already asked it in the same comment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because I knew you wouldn&#39;t answer it.  You still haven&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are you talking about</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m talking about your eagerness to ascribe motives to a woman you&#39;ve never met whose side of the story you never cared to hear before passing judgement on her character.</p>

<p>That should be obvious. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are you talking about? What fact did I say I don&#39;t know about?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The honest answer that you refuse to give:  Time elapsed in the store between their entry and the request that they leave.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yep, and that&#39;s why anecdotal evidence is weak. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why did you feel the need to tell the world that you&#39;re &quot;white&quot; and have never been asked to leave Starbucks? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, and other witnesses said that the other people in the starbucks were doing the same thing but had no problem. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s more likely,  two black guys walk into a Starbucks and everyone inside drops their conversations to witness their entire encounter inside the store, or a number of snotty libshits saw an opportunity to virtue signal from the comfort of their natural environment (a warm, cozy Starbucks Coffee) and just couldn&#39;t help themselves?</p>

<p>I know how it looks from here. Folks like yourself don&#39;t help the matter much. </p>

<p>Yes. I am. I&#39;m at school right now, studying, and procrastinating by replying to you. The videos exist, that&#39;s why it became a news story in the first place. There are two videos of the incident and they both went viral. You can either look it up or not. It&#39;s your choice. </p>

<p>Also notice, that you are the only one throwing around insults, and what I said about annecdotal experiences applies to me as well. I know my story is true, that&#39;s all I can say, but I know it&#39;s easily dissmassable as well. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve not insulted you once.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>procrastinating by replying to you. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not replying to me; you&#39;re replying at me and spinning like a top.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t find video proving your narrative (because you know it doesn&#39;t exist), you won&#39;t answer one very simple question.  Again,  you&#39;re not replying <em>to</em> me.  You&#39;re replying <em>at</em> me.  And apparently you&#39;ve got plenty of time to do that... but hitting that home button and pulling up the youtube app.  My god, the effort <em>that</em> would take!</p>

<p>You would have an easier time finding that nonexistent video than quoting where I insulted you.</p>

<p>And if that&#39;s the case, no I&#39;m not Jewish, I&#39;m anti-Zeonist, and believe that Israel is one of the biggest contributors to human rights violations in the world and a large source of corruption and conspiracies involving the states and the middle east. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh. I just lose my patience easier now a days and don&#39;t have the energy any more with people that want to just be combative and argue for arguements sake. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind people disagreeing with me or proving me wrong, but I find it&#39;s a waste of time if they do it in a rude combative way. </p>

<p>Sorry for taking up space in the comments though. </p>

<p>Cheers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk what yous two are arguing about but being black is not a good excuse to refuse to leave a place when asked by management and by the police. I don’t know when that sort of thinking happened, but seriously, I can’t use but I’m white so I don’t have to leave when asked, so why would anybody else be able to say that? People arguing that it’s because the pink haired uber feminist sjw manager is a racist are just ignoring the fact that she asked them to leave. You got a problem? File a law suit, but you still leave. When the cops come and ask you to leave, you leave. When you arent welcome, regardless of why, you leave. This is a Starbucks in downtown philadelphia, which is a minority majority city, two out of every three customers are people of color, foh with this racist nonsense. This was a set up. Starbucks stock is down, everybody in philly went to Dunkin this morning to virtue signal. Lol it’s brilliant. </p>

<p>It is funny how when black people are being portrayed as some sort of a victim everyone abandons any notion of context.</p>

<p>Thank you for bringing it back around. </p>
