        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For extorting from me and my fellow Americans $4,000,000,000.00 a year for the last 4 decades, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For taking our most sophisticated weapons technology and stealing it for yourself without paying the American patent holders, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For taking that high-tech military technology and selling it to our enemies, such as the Russians and Chinese, thus further endangering us, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using that weaponry in a sustained attack against a United States ship, the USS Liberty, in an attempt to sink her, thus preventing US servicemen from revealing to the rest of the world information concerning the war crimes they witnessed you commit against Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai Desert during the Six Day War, as well as for the purposes of dragging the US into yet another one of your murderous adventures, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For killing 35 and wounding 170 American sailors aboard the USS Liberty, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For bribing the United States government into covering it up, preventing any justice from being done for the benefit of the families of the lost sailors – as well as the American People, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For sending your agents into Egypt and blowing up American buildings for the purpose of blaming the Arabs in an event known as the Lavon Affair, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For sending your agents into Libya during the Reagan administration, and broadcasting radio messages in Arabic that were designed to sound like “terrorist cell planning” so that the US would initiate military strikes against Khadafi in an event known as Operation Trojan Horse, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For withholding information from us concerning the planned attacks against the US Marine barracks in Lebanon, attacks you knew about through your moles in the Islamic world and about which you deliberately refused to warn us in order to further your interests against the Arabs, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For employing Jonathon Pollard, an American serviceman paid to spy for Israel in order to steal even more of our National Security secrets for your parasitic purposes, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For breaking every agreement you have made with your Arab neighbors, stealing their land, displacing, murdering, and treating them like the animals you see them as, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using your agents within the first Bush administration to involve us in the first Gulf War, causing the deaths of American men and women, and exposing our servicemen to whatever bio-weapons were and are responsible which have led to Gulf War Syndrome, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For your role in the September 11 attacks in this country, and for blackmailing and bribing the US government into deporting back to Israel the 100 or more intelligence agents that were arrested after the attacks, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For suppressing the information from the American people of your involvement in the September 11 attacks and sending us in the wrong direction in search of answers, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using one of your agents in the US Army Weapons Lab to steal anthrax and distribute it into our mail system, terrorizing US citizens and killing several in order to blame the Arabs, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using your agents in the US Government, namely, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Perle, Abrams, and the rest into initiating this war in the Middle East so that you could bring to heel all the enemies you have made during the last 50 years, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using your agents in the media to lie to us on a minute by minute basis about the war, lying to us as to how “just” this cause is, and what the real reasons behind it are, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using your agents in the Christian Evangelical community, such as Falwell, Graham, Swaggert, Robertson and the rest who praise you as God’s chosen people and further keep Americans in the dark about who you really are what you have done, and what you are truly about, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For bringing idiots like Limbaugh, Liddy, Hannity, Beck, O’Reilly and Savage to the forefront as paid liars who will support you and further lead Americans astray, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For making America your attack dog, and for sending her sons and daughters to fight and die in all your future wars, we bless thee.
For using your influence in the media to hide the real statistics about the war, the dead and wounded on both sides, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using us in such a way that not only further inflames the Arab world against us, but as well has succeeded in our alienating ourselves against those nations with whom we have been friendly for over a century, we bless thee.</p>

<p>And finally, for using your influence in our media and academia to flood our minds with pornography and lies, as well as inculcating in us a hatred for our history, religion, and culture, for dividing our nation between races and sexes, and for releasing into our society all of your plagues and filth that have left us a rotted out corpse of a once great nation, oh Israel, our friend,</p>

<p>We bless thee.</p>

<p>Just because you&#39;ve hear it said in the mainstream for your entire life, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s an accurate term.

<p>Just as I personally don&#39;t exonerate myself and my fellow Americans for the absolutely horrible reputation TPTB in the United States has gotten for themselves abroad and domestically (we the people need to come together as one and take these pieces of shit out of power - and if we don&#39;t and can&#39;t do that, then it <em>is</em> our fault, and we get the government we deserve), I also don&#39;t exonerate the citizens of Israel for the shit actions of their shit government.</p>

<p>Additionally, there actually seem to be a LOT of Israeli citizens as a matter of fact tthat are indeed utter racists and need to go down just as hard as their shit, horrible government.</p>

<p>Among many others, all the people taking part, agreeing with, and moving into the &quot;settlements&quot; in Palestine are absolutely part of the Israeli problem.</p>

<p>Biden also said :u don&#39;t have to be a jews yo be a zionists&quot;... doest sound like him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, I guess your question was kind of weird, because the government and administration are kind of the same thing, so why blame one and not the other?</p>

<p>To answer the question, yes it is the government&#39;s fault. Especially since the popular vote was derailed by the DNC and Hillary Clinton, so it&#39;s not like we can even elect a president such as Bernie Sanders who would even attempt to fix some of these bad choices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jerusalem Post, March, 2010:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/When-Ben-Gurion-said-no-to-JFK"><strong>WHEN BEN-GURION SAID NO TO JFK</strong></a></p>

<p>Excerpts:</p>

<hr/>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>But history shows that some issues are so critical that even the president of the United States cannot force Israel’s hand. [...] The sharpest example took place almost 50 years ago, when John F. Kennedy demanded that David Ben-Gurion end Israel’s nuclear deterrent program, deemed necessary to ensure Jewish survival in a very hostile world.</p>

<p>THE CLASH began in 1960, when the outgoing Eisenhower administration sought an explanation for the mysterious construction near Dimona. It was told that this top-secret activity in the middle of the desert was a harmless textile plant, and no, it could not come and visit....</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>When president Kennedy took office in 1961, the disagreement became a full-blown crisis [...] Every high-level meeting or communication repeated the demand for inspection of Dimona </p>

<p>[...] </p>

<p>Ben-Gurion avoided saying no by dancing around them for two years </p>

<p>[...] </p>

<p>Finally, Kennedy had enough, and in a personal letter dated May 18, 1963, the president warned that unless American inspectors were allowed into Dimona (meaning the end of any military activities), Israel would find itself totally isolated. Rather than answering, Ben-Gurion abruptly resigned.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Six months later, Kennedy was dead.</p>

That&#39;s why their victory was so crushing and decisive. They used illegal chemical weapons and white phosphorous on civilians. Killed thousands, then attacked the ship to hide the evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The democrats made the Iran deal, JCPOA. For this, Israel hacked all of them and leaked their secrets as blackmail for not ending the Iran Deal. Then pushing Trump so they could get Jerusalem and all the war hawks in to start a war in Syria and Iran. This also has caused us to be at a near nuclear war with Russia. Israel leaked everything to wikileaks and spoofed the Russians. The Russians found their exploits called duqu 2.0 and used them against America too and israel got America to be mad at russia for stealing Israel&#39;s hack. Israel then helped shadowbrokers get their arsenal to sell to criminals the world over to cover thsit tracks and force ametica to make a big change which allowed Israel&#39;s integrated systems. </p>

<p>To answer the question, yes it is the government&#39;s fault. Especially since the popular vote was derailed by the DNC and Hillary Clinton, so it&#39;s not like we can even elect a president such as Bernie Sanders who would even attempt to fix some of these bad choices.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“What must be done is that the United States of America must have a Middle East policy which is even-handed, which does not simply supply endless amounts of money, of military support to Israel, but which treats both sides with respect and dignity, and does our best to bring them to the table.” -Bernie Sanders</p>
