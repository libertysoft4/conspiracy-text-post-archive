        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s aliens, so let me get that out of the way. But considering we are told that these civilizations only had access to copper and bronze tools, I don&#39;t understand how they were able to pull these off in granite none the less. You can clearly see the groves around the bore hole indicating some type of drilling and even an indention at the end where they didn&#39;t complete the hole. Another thing to point out is that the spaces between the grooves indicate that their &quot;drills&quot; were 14 times quicker/more efficient than we can even accomplish today with modern technology. I guess my main question is, why is this so obvious anomaly not debated in MS academics more? Tough question huh lmao!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit ropes and pulleys lifted 1 Ton plus rocks. That only chisels were used to cut the rock. That stone age civilizations could fit together rocks so perfectly that a piece of paper can&#39;t slip between them. They show obvious signs of being precut as they go around corners. There are metal interlocks between stones far before smelting was thought to exist. These people didn&#39;t just write random shit down or make these marvels for the hell of it. Look at the written accounts as historical record and we may learn that we are finally catching up to our ancestors. Maybe we lost this knowledge in the destruction of the library of Alexandria</p>

These people were supposed hunter gathers(Gobekli Tepe) who were still chasing around game for sustenance at the time. Then let&#39;s not get into the actual knowledge that is carved onto the stones themselves. Let&#39;s then look at all kinds of mathematical info that can be derived from the Great Pyramid.

Carve the inside of that box with perfect 90 angles.  Fit blocks together with zero room between them.  Cut rocks/blocks at irregular angles to perfectly fit other irregular blocks.  Put a long, thin tunnel thru granite.  </p>

<p>I’m not a stone mason or an expert on any of this but I do know that granite can be cut with primitive tools. That is absolutely proven. I believe that granite can be polished as well with primitive tools but I’m at work right now so I’m not about to really research that to be positive. Given that, how would it be impossible to not have the time/skill do do those things?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I put conspiracy in quotes because I wasn’t sure if it really fit there. I guess I should have used “alternative.” </p>

<p>Anyways I still stand by what is said in that I believe that the granite can (and was) cut/carved into shapes/designs with primitive tools because that makes the most sense to me out of any theory I’ve heard so far and that just happens to go along with the mainstream theory. One thing we both know is that these stones were cut and I’ve asked others (I may have asked you too) in this thread but I haven’t got an answer on how these stones were actually cut if it wasn’t with primitive tools. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gotcha on the &quot;alternative&quot;...agreed. As to building them, I really don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not married to one theory over another. The one thing I will say is that it doesn&#39;t make logical sense for megalithic structures to be built to that size and scale unless there was some type of technological know how that made the quarrying and transport easy. Would we build 40 story buildings nowadays without the use of tools and large moving equipment to ease the process? Like I had mentioned before as well....what about the sophisticated astrological knowledge that seems to be built into these as well. They are there so there is no disputing that they were done somehow. I have my ideas but they are just that....ideas.</p>

<p>Yea I prolly should not have been specific.  I was typing a short-hand answer whilst working.  Granite was a catchall term for Very Hard Stone.  Depending on the site (Serapeum at Saarqa, Goebleki, the quarry in Kosovo, anything in Peru, on and on), the specific stone used is different.  I&#39;m not trying to remember and then rote name all types of stone used in all types of megaliths.</p>

<p>Sure, we carve a headstone.  If one is familiar with the curiosities at the megaliths, carving a granite headstone isn&#39;t really germane to the topic (tho my fault for bringing it up).</p>

<p>You know that the rockets are not assembled on the launch pad, right?

    <div class="md"><p>I have already conceded on all semantical points.  You&#39;ve pulled one small portion of my reply and blown it outta proportion and context.  For this you win the internet.</p>

<p>Wait, which video?  You mean you haven&#39;t actually watched anything on Saqqra?  Pick one that appeals to you.</p>

<p>Here is some info about stone megaliths from Peru/Andes, note the first sentence.</p>

<p>&quot;The processes and technologies involved in the creation of these temples are still not fully understood by modern scholars. Our current ideas of the Tiwanaku culture hold that they had no writing system and also that the invention of the wheel was most likely unknown to them.</p>

<p>The architectural achievements seen at Pumapunku are striking in light of the presumed level of technological capability available during its construction. Due to the monumental proportions of the stones, the method by which they were transported to Pumapunku has been a topic of interest since the temple&#39;s discovery.</p>

<p>The stones are argued to have been transported up a steep incline from a quarry near Lake Titicaca roughly 20 miles away. Some of the blocks are said to weigh in the range of 100Đ130 tons.</p>

<p>One notable block has been measured at 36 feet long, 16 feet wide and 6 feet thick. Archaeologists argue that this was accomplished by the large labor force of ancient Tiwanaku. Several theories have been proposed as to how this labor force transported the stones although these theories remain speculative. Two of the more common proposals involve the use of llama skin ropes and the use of ramps and inclined planes.</p>

<p>In assembling the walls of Pumapunku, each stone was finely cut to interlock with the surrounding stones and the blocks fit together like a puzzle, forming load-bearing joints without the use of mortar. One common engineering technique involves cutting the top of the lower stone at a certain angle, and placing another stone on top of it which was cut at the same angle.</p>

<p>The precision with which these angles have been utilized to create flush joints is indicative of a highly sophisticated knowledge of stone-cutting and a thorough understanding of descriptive geometry.</p>

<p>Many of the joints are so precise that not even a razor blade will fit between the stones.</p>

<p>Much of the masonry is characterized by accurately cut rectilinear blocks of such uniformity that they could be interchanged for one another while maintaining a level surface and even joints.</p>

<p>The blocks were so precisely cut as to suggest the possibility of prefabrication and mass production, technologies far in advance of the TiwanakuŐs Incan successors hundreds of years later.&quot;</p>

These are temples and tombs that great rulers could throw slaves at for their own religious purposes, and there were probably thousands of people being whipped to death for not cutting stones exactly right.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying shipbuilders nowadays lack the finesse to handcraft a wooden ship-of-the-line, simply because no one&#39;s bothered to. We&#39;ve lost that ability (generally, as a race) but that&#39;s because we found better and easier ways to do it.</p>

Go ahead, go to any done mason, give home the tools of the day and tell him to replicate it. Lemme know how that works out for you.

    <div class="md"><p>Saying that we couldn&#39;t do this today is embellishment meant to make these structures and monuments seem all the more incredible and mysterious and suggest that these ancient civilizations must have had some incredible technology to achieve it. It&#39;s completely wrong, though, and no such incredible, unthinkable technology is required. </p>

<p>So then it just comes down to guessing at what they were capable of and saying how unbelievable it is that ancient civilizations were able to work stone to specific measurements or move heavy things. Is it, though? Is it really so unbelievable?</p>

<p>Without the idea that this is advanced and beyond what can be done today, that really is the crux of the argument: &quot;I can&#39;t believe they were capable of this&quot;, and I think that&#39;s pretty weak. Obviously other people think so, too, or there wouldn&#39;t be a need to embellish it like we saw earlier.</p>

<p>Here is how they moved it, p/wikipedia:</p>

<p>Given the technical limitations of the day, transporting it was no easy feat: The French government ordered a purpose-built seagoing lighter built by the Toulon naval yard; this 49 metres long, flat bottomed, three masted ship named the Louqsor was sailed up the Nile to Luxor where 300 workmen dug a canal to allow the ship to come close to the obelisk. The French seamen then lowered the obelisk with an array of blocks and tackles, yardarms and capstans. The re-erection of the obelisk on the Place de la Concorde during a ceremony carefully planned by King Louis-Philippe I was no mean engineering feat either.</p>

<p>Read book 10, it explains it. Applying modern math to the methodology described there works out. (Most people doing &quot;ancient approaches&quot; neglected the construction engines described here.) And much of the stuff in there is actually passed down from previous or other cultures. Most of the citation would point towards the Greeks, but I&#39;d think some of the practices are even older than that.</p>

<p>Randall Carlson is the person you should look up. He has compiled decades of surveying data (he has traveled the world and meticulously documented everything) as well as peer-reviewed studies published in reputable journals. He has done extremely compelling presentations on the Joe Rogan Podcast. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R31SXuFeX0A">Here</a> is an episode.

<p>I respectfully disagree there. If you look at the sheer scale of these structures, it is impossible for hunter gatherers to have made them. Structures like the ones found in Gobleki Tepi require an existing wealth of knowledge in engineering, arts, architecture, etc., which a hunter gatherer society simply would not have.</p>

<p>Check out the podcast again to refresh your memory; the studies Carlson cites along with his own data is extremely solid imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely don’t want to imply that I’m any kind of expert or have even put a lot of time into researching this. </p>

<p>From what I’ve seen, when people start calling the mainstream Egypt (or other primitive civilizations) theories out they seem to always circle back to two different theories: that there was even older civilizations that actually made the monoliths and then died off or that it was by the help of ancient aliens. </p>

<p>I got kind of sucked into the ancient aliens thing and found the shows/books interesting. I thought “yeah how the hell could these primitive people pull this off???” Then I found an awesome documentary that basically went step by step and broke down how the ancient alien theory is an absolute joke. I’m on mobile now so I don’t want to link the video but it is very very easy to find, just google “Ancient Aliens Debunked” it’s a three hour long documentary and very detailed. It made the show that I used to find thoughtful and informative into something that is just something grasping for straws and even hilarious/frustrating to watch. </p>

<p>As far as the theory about an older civilization being there before and dying off, I find that more reasonable than the alien theory by I haven’t really given it the time that it would really need for me to give an opinion on its validity. </p>

<p>It was probably made in the 1930&#39;s, that style hole was evidently common in Scandinavia. </p>

<p>Making stone holes isnt easy but it wasnt beyond the scope of early civilizations. </p>

<p>Another thing to point out is that the spaces between the grooves indicate that their &quot;drills&quot; were 14 times quicker/more efficient than we can even accomplish today with modern technology. </p>

I can&#39;t find any, but it doesn&#39;t matter, because we have found much more complex objects than cylindrical shaped metal.

    <div class="md"><p>Mention aliens and serious academics run for the hills. There needs to be a paradigm shift in academia that finally acknowledges high technology in the past without mentioning aliens. This makes the theory more accessible to mainstream researchers since it could be verified with existing evidence. I&#39;m not denying that aliens might have had a role in nurturing human technology, but as it stands now there is no evidence of aliens that could be examined by the public</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d argue that our evolution is being altered in a negative way, and that we had better genes back then than we do now. Everyone forgets to mention that dominance hierarchies play the biggest role in evolution, and that if an area doesn&#39;t have enough food, the leader goes somewhere else, and everyone follows him. We did not evolve starving. We get hungry pretty quickly. The fact that our brains use up calories doesn&#39;t constitute an evolutionary factor. The leader eats first when there is not enough food as well. In fact, to distribute food fairly when there is not enough of it, it would benefit females to get pregnant in order to demand access to food before others, because it&#39;s harder to deny somebody food when they&#39;re pregnant. How many creatures on earth are constantly fucking starving? Not that many, and we&#39;re not one of them. How they can stress factors that don&#39;t have to do with dominance when teaching evolution, I do not know.</p>

<p>Before greater apes evolved, the lesser primates were not in africa yet. Their social structures to this day consists of a leader with unlimited power and a bunch of others who aren&#39;t currently possessing unlimited power but switch off with each other to be leader. Nobody directly attacks the leader. They are like marionettes, controlled by the leader. When two of them slap one another, it is because the leader made a certain facial expression instead of another one which would have been optimal. In this way the leader chooses subconsciously for himself to step down, as another replaces him. In modern day china there are snub-nosed monkeys with no nose bridge sticking out. They migrate around according to the will of their unlimited power-wielding leaders who are sometimes leaders and sometimes not. Over generations the lesser primates of China ended up in Africa that many millions of years ago, along with lesser primates from all around the world at that point in time (continents looked different and were more connected). They were all &#39;lead by their silverbacks&#39; to the same place. Then greater apes emerged: chimps and orangutans and gorillas and us. Then our Homo genus, still guided by unlimited power, went back to exactly from where they came from. There is a harmony in the world, arching over what is possibly comprehensible, that they have broken. When our power was fragmented by democracy we lost the most biologically vital state of our species&#39; existence we had. It is a distracting manipulation imposed on us by racists who demand we do automatable jobs all day so that they can enjoy their ultracarnivorous lives atop the mass of our effort and flesh.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that there was a relatively advanced civilization, possibly globe-spanning, that was essentially wiped out around 12,000 years ago during the Younger Dryas impacts and subsequent &quot;global flood&quot; (sea level are believed to have risen 300-400 ft around this period...today approximately 50-80% of humanity lives within 100 km of an oceanic coast... No reason to think that was different then. The reason we &quot;have no evidence&quot; is because it&#39;s hard as fuck to do anything underwater, let alone explore submerged ancient ruins. ) Survivors of this cataclysm would go on to  found the accepted historical civilizations, in the Fertile Crescent, Indus Valley, Olmec area, etc. If you haven&#39;t, look into Goebekli Tepe, and the works of Graham Hancock, Randall Carlson, and John Anthony West (RIP)</p>

They are the only souvenir of a time when certain ethnicities owned their own land. Now that peoples have been fractured across country borders, subjugated into paying rent, and obliged to adopt religious practices hailing the glory of Abraham&#39;s genealogical line, to manipulate a few &#39;professionals&#39; into extinguishing a spiritual heritage is as easy as giving them a five-figure income and buying them two plane tickets. Racism stands propped up on pure evil. Many of these sites contain idols of deities from polytheistic religions. In polytheistic religions, each ethnicity is represented by a deity. Even people traded with have a deity. The racists came and took all. That&#39;s why there is pain and suffering in the world. They systematically deharmonize us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely agree,</p>

<p>The archaelogists&#39; standards and oversight are all a part of their looting. It&#39;s simply unfair for these relics to be so disrespected. They are the only souvenir of a time when certain ethnicities owned their own land. Now that peoples have been fractured across country borders, subjugated into paying rent, and obliged to adopt religious practices hailing the glory of Abraham&#39;s genealogical line, to manipulate a few &#39;professionals&#39; into extinguishing a spiritual heritage is as easy as giving them a five-figure income and buying them two plane tickets. Racism stands propped up on pure evil. Many of these sites contain idols of deities from polytheistic religions. In polytheistic religions, each ethnicity is represented by a deity. Even people traded with have a deity. The racists came and took all. That&#39;s why there is pain and suffering in the world. They systematically deharmonize us.</p>

<p>Before greater apes evolved, the lesser primates were not in africa yet. Their social structures to this day consists of a leader with unlimited power and a bunch of others who aren&#39;t currently possessing unlimited power but switch off with each other to be leader. Nobody directly attacks the leader. They are like marionettes, controlled by the leader. When two of them slap one another, it is because the leader made a certain facial expression instead of another one which would have been optimal. In this way the leader chooses subconsciously for himself to step down, as another replaces him. In modern day china there are snub-nosed monkeys with no nose bridge sticking out.

    <div class="md"><p>I like the theory that the Sphinx and Pyramids are Significantly older. Like the Sphinx is about 360,000 years old. It has to be at least 16,000 years older than previously thought because there is evidence of water erosion, the last even being 16,000 years prior. I like the theory that that was built by a previous civilization and then what we know as the Egyptians found the structures and adopted their art style thinking it was made by the gods. I can say its a joke to say it took only rope, pulleys and manpower to move those stones. The Great Pyramid matches almost perfectly with constellations, that math is near computer accurate. They left freaking pictures of them using lightbulbs. There is no soot in the pyramids so they didn&#39;t use torches and its too far for the mirror trick. The sphinx has a manmade square compartment underneath its right paw. Ancient Civilizations had advanced technology. Mainstream Archaeology puts its fingers in its ears to avoid looking into these inconsistencies. Our record is wrong. Our historical timeline needs to be rewritten.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just finished watching a few videos with potential theories relating to this.</p>

<p>The first theory was that the Egyptians (and Incas) used a highly polished gold disks to create a lazer beam like cutting tool. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehbBl1xdpjY&amp;amp;ab_channel=AncientArchitects">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehbBl1xdpjY&amp;amp;ab_channel=AncientArchitects</a></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The second theory involved using the harmonic resonance from large tuning forks for cutting and drilling.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H2-BawRLGw&amp;amp;ab_channel=AncientArchitects">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H2-BawRLGw&amp;amp;ab_channel=AncientArchitects</a></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, neither video provided any actual demonstrations of the theorized techniques. Still an interesting watch and something to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know... maybe. Until I see someone produce a full scale replica using and proving their chosen methods I&#39;m not convinced of anything and open to any ideas.</p>

<p>I still think the argument raised about longevity and durability of those hand tools carving into granite and diorite is a valid one.
Maybe their metallurgists discovered the secretes to making stronger versions of copper and/or steel tools. I&#39;m not a geologist, metallurgist, or engineer so I couldn&#39;t say one way or another with any certainty. </p>

<p>Either way the shear size of these structures and precision of the joinery is an absolute art.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to make it clear that I’m not an expert on any of this or the other topics you listed either as well. </p>

<p>With that said, I think that the primitive tools being <em>so</em> basic also helped the Egyptians. That sounds crazy to even type but I don’t think I find the correct way to explain it.</p>

<p>The great thing about a copper or bronze stone saw is that it’s so damn simple. It’s literally just a flat bar. If one wears to the point that it is no longer usable you just get a new flat bar. Also the old tool can be melted down and remade into a new tool as well. Just add sand start sawing on some granite using the slave labor and soon you have two rocks and some sore backs. </p>

<p>I think it is super common to look back on ancient civilizations and think that they must have been not as smart as modern man and I am guilty of this from time to time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on the shape and the tool. But we&#39;re talking copper hand tools, right? </p>

<p>cutting- impractical nearing the point of impossible. </p>

<p>polishing- not sure how this would go. i imagine it&#39;d be like sanding a piece of wood with sawdust. so impractical.</p>

<p>&quot;ok so why does time matter when they had billions of slaves?&quot;</p>

<p>Well, because slaves wouldn&#39;t have given a damn. You can&#39;t force people to paint a mona lisa. The pyramids are at every level a mastercraft, beyond the scope of detail possible with simple idiots forced to work with even simpler copper tools. And remember, the internal structure of the pyramids is rose granite. limestone is pretty workable, even with copper tools. Granite is fucking hard. But there&#39;s no difference between the workmanship. The granite is cut and shaped just as perfectly as the softer limestone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly the same as a modern core drill hole. I&#39;ve also seen pictures of ancient saw cuts that could have only been made by a large rotary cutter. To the people saying it&#39;s done by hand I would say, that making cuts like that would be incredibly time consuming. Some of these pics depict OVERcuts, where the tool has cut further into the stock than required. I can assure you this would not occur using hand tools, but very commonly occurs using power tools. Try it yourself by cutting halfway through a slab of hardwood with both a hand saw and a circular saw. See if you feel like cutting further than required even just doing that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it more believable that people cut further than they needed to in a piece of granite or is it more common that they had ancient power tools?</p>

<p>Just a totally made up example but let’s say you are building a log cabin in 1900 and you have to cut down trees for the building supplies. If you cut down 50 trees with an ax and hand saw, but it turns out that you only needed 45 after it’s all said done people wouldn’t assume that it was impossible for you to have done that with a hand saw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cutting down trees commonly used in log cabins takes minutes, even with an axe. For your analogy to be even remotely close, the builder would have to cut down hundreds of trees extra to compare to some of the over cutting I&#39;ve seen in those pictures.

    <div class="md"><p>Relatively early bronze age technology is sufficient to utilize steam power. (Many of these civs were past stone age, and had plenty of examples of metal work.) I think a lot of people miss that fact. No, it&#39;s not going to be the kind of highly efficient high-pressure engine we associate with steam power because of the risk of it exploding. However the steam used is still sufficient to spin a flywheel via a reaction jet, or vibrate a resonant pipe, and either of those combined with an abrasive material will be plenty sufficient to cut a hole in a reasonable timeframe.</p>
