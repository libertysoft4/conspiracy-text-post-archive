        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How deep does Alex ever go? It&#39;s always muh globalists reptillians Bilderberg You think Alex doesn&#39;t know about neo Aristotlean elite bloodlines? The Vatican? Khazarian crypto Jews? Rothschilds Rockerfellers? Come on.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYl9iZlArjM&amp;amp;app=desktop">why is Alex Gatekeeping for CNP?</a></p>

<p>Well maybe because a little bit of research into them will take you from Rothschilds all the way to Trump.</p>

<p>Well first we can start with you see Jerome Corsi (Washington correspondent Infowars) is a member of <a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/how-the-big-brother-controls-alternative-media/">CNP</a> - council for national policy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2016/08/trump-campaign-ceo-and-manager-part-of-secret-extremist-right-wing-group-splc/">As is Bannon.</a> Conway. Erik Prince of blackwater fame. Oliver North. Iran Contra. Cocaine running under Bush. So we see the same necons of Bush cabinet, behind Trump this time around. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/03/22/521083950/inside-the-wealthy-family-that-has-been-funding-steve-bannon-s-plan-for-years">Breitbart was founded by the Mercer family..</a></p>

<p>The Mercer family <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Rothschild&#x27;s_Bank_-_The_Best_Club_In_London">are an old Rothschild proxy, very old money.</a>
Its a rarely discussed but very relevant fact that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/us-billionaire-mercer-helped-back-brexit">Mercer was decisive in securing key positions for his long time family advisers</a> - Kellyane Conway &amp; Robert Bannon . In addition to working as assets on Mercer family projects, Mercer had Conway organise the spending for Cruz&#39;s failed campaign. . After which they changed their support to Trump. <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/37180/Council_for_National_Policy">The Mercer Foundation also happens to be the #1 financier of CNP.</a> You may have seen Rebekah Mercer named as part of Trumps transition team.</p>

<p>150 CNP members recently signed a draft of an executive order, <a href="https://www.toddstarnes.com/uncategorized/conservatives-call-on-trump-to-protect-religious-liberty/">to protect Religious Liberty.</a></p>

<p>If signed it would create wholesale exemptions from a range of nondiscrimination laws and regulations “for people and organizations who claim religious objections to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity.”</p>

<p>After 8, years of liberal policies from Obama, the introduction of such a bill is designed to cause extreme unrest and division. As is always the case- when we fight each other, we remain blissfully unaware of the hidden hands.</p>

<p>So it becomes clear, not only is Trump controlled opposition, but the alternative media that support him, his advisers, shady conservative think tanks that produce his policy and the (sadbuttrue)worlds most recognisable conspiracy personality are all Rothschild/ Cabal entities. <a href="http://www.spirituallysmart.com/Jones-CIA.htm">Alex has acknowledged his family worked in the CIA.</a></p>

<p>None of this new however. If you&#39;ve been following Trumps cabinet picks, you might remember <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-wilbur-ross-commerce-20161208-story.html">Wilbur Ross?</a>. Working for Rothschild inc in 1990 Ross helped Trump avoid bankruptcy after the latter missed multiple bond payments on the struggling Taj Mahal. At the time it was known Trumps finances were unravelling and he&#39;d been unable to secure finances until Rothschild Inc sent Ross to save the day.</p>

<p>When asked why he&#39;d made a deal with Trump, Ross insisted that Trump was worth saving. &quot;“The Trump name is still very much an asset,” he said.</p>

<p>The Rothschild were wise to deploy Mercer &amp; Ross to assist Trump over the years, they certainly seem to have accquired a prime asset in Trump, no doubt. The President of the United States is fully under Rothschild/Cabal control. A traitor is in the White House.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they&#39;re not. Jews were barred from becoming Jesuits for 350 years.</p>

<p>In fact the <strong><em>Jesuit Order created the modern antisemitic movement</em></strong> in the late 1800s. I cannot stress this enough. This is what laid the foundation for the holocaust. The Jesuits in their <em>La Civilta Cattolica</em> lambasted the Rothschilds as part of their antisemitic crusade; same tactics as today&#39;s alt-right movement, neo-Nazi movement, etc. That&#39;s right, those movements have derived their views on the Jews from Jesuit Catholic literature. </p>

<p>But the Rothschilds did work for the Vatican at one time and Carl Rothschild kissed the hand of the pope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, read Kertzer&#39;s <em>Popes Against the Jews</em>; it is the scholarly source on the topic. Kertzer straight out says the Jesuits were responsible for laying the foundation for the enactment of the Italian racial laws against the Jews. </p>

<p>Mussolini was advised by the Jesuit Tacchi Venturi; they met daily and this Jesuit was influencing Mussolini to be harsher on the Jews. </p>

<p>To answer your question: Vatican II was the feigned reconciliation between the Jews and papacy. Vatican II was dominated by the Jesuits. Basically, the Jews are going to suck up to the Vatican now in exchange for not being cleansed again. You&#39;ll notice there are hardly any Jewish scholars who are critical of the Vatican. The only one I know of is Kertzer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sense some confusion here. </p>

<p>The claim was that the Rothschilds are Jesuits. They are not, and the article does not demonstrate the contrary.</p>

<p>The Jesuits, as I showed, persecuted the Rothschilds in their magazine <em>La Civilita Cattolica</em>. As it happens, that magazine received funding from the Rothschilds before the Jesuits initiated their antisemitic campaign. The funding for <em>Cattolica</em> was given in 1850, only two decades after Carl Rothschild was knighted into the pope&#39;s Constantinian Order, when the Rothschilds were still on good terms with the Vatican. The Jesuits initiate their anti-Jewish writings in about 1880, which include condemnations of the Rothschilds, as part of a world-wide Jewish conspiracy. Resulting from this, as it happens, in the next century Hitler would confiscate the Rothschilds&#39; assets. The conclusion is that the Rothschilds are tools of the papacy, not Jesuits, but <em>used by</em> the Jesuits. </p>

<p>In the end, the Rothschilds are just another set of usurous banking families, out for their own interests, and totally willing to work for those in power to extend their financial gain. That&#39;s why they worked for the European monarchs as &quot;court Jews.&quot; It&#39;s why the Rothschilds worked for the Vatican, knowing that their fellow Jews were being held in the ghettos of the papal states with limited rights and poor living conditions, were forced to attend Catholic sermons and were subject to all sorts of humiliation by the priests and Catholic laity. The Rothschilds showed they will work for Rome, despite the interests of the Jewish people. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>These Popes also both happen to be Jesuits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There has only ever been one Jesuit Pope. But, the Papacy has been controlled by the Jesuits since 1814, with the Bull of Restoration of Pius VII.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The claim is that they are subordinate to the Jesuits, and work together for a common purpose, which seems to be setting up a new world order in the image of imperialist Rome with the pope as &quot;emperor&quot;.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>These three financial families, the Rothschilds, Morgans, and Rockefellers all do the bidding of the Jesuit Order because of Jesuit infiltration in their organizations. They do whatever is necessary to destroy constitutional liberty in America and to bring the pope to world domination. As we look back over the 20th century, we see how successful the Jesuits have been. They have continued to squander the wealth of America and continually attack its great constitution and civil liberties. Daily, the power of the pope in Vatican City increases.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I could have explained my thought process better a bit earlier, I can concede that. </p>

<p>My main concern with all this are the prophetical implications. A man claiming to be Christ on Earth is calling for a global new world governmental order, under himself.  He is pushing the ecumenical movement to unite all religion, also under himself. Torture and trial-free imprisonment is back with a vengeance. This is literally the end of the world in Christian prophecy.</p>

<p>Religious freedom has been part of our culture since the foundation of the nation.</p>

<p>Gay/trans normalization has only been here for 15 minutes. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even religious, but I&#39;m not willing to throw over religious freedom for some Cultural Marxist fad that&#39;s younger than the milk in my refrigerator.</p>

<p>Being neither religious, nor of an alternative sexuality, all I have to go by is who is trying to control my speech, criminalize my free expression, bully and suppress dissent. Hint: It&#39;s not the religious. </p>

<p>The screaming irony of your post is that you&#39;re trying to frame conservative Constitutionalists as &quot;Rothschild agents,&quot; while framing Cultural Marxist craziness promoted by Rothschild as wholesome, all-American social engineering that we must all adopt.</p>

<p>Sorry, but I&#39;m pretty sure the Founding Fathers didn&#39;t believe in trans propaganda. (That&#39;s Rothschild shit.) Here&#39;s an article on Thomas Jefferson lobbying for legislation to castrate homosexuals: <a href="https://americanvision.org/11454/jeffersons-law-of-castration-and-maiming-the-tyranny-of-humanistic-law/">https://americanvision.org/11454/jeffersons-law-of-castration-and-maiming-the-tyranny-of-humanistic-law/</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: I know you really, really, REALLY want to believe that the Founding Fathers were pro-perversion, and anti-family values, but I&#39;m not going to resist insulting anyone&#39;s intelligence on this thread by taking up your pretense that they would have sided with Lord Rothschild against the religious in America. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>Go get me an example of religious people demanding people use certain pronouns and change the dictionary.</p>

<p>Go get me examples of the religious suing people into conforming to their belief-systems and using the power of the state to enforce it.</p>

<p>As I said: I have no dog in this fight. I&#39;m an atheist. And I&#39;m also not of an alternative sexuality. I don&#39;t really care about either group in and of themselves. All I care is about my own freedoms being infringed upon by control-freaks.</p>

<p>And if the two groups, the gay (trans) lobby is vastly more self-righteous, controlling and totalitarian. </p>

<p>No one is being driven out of academia for NOT being a certain religion. But you WILL be driven out if you refuse to &quot;play ball&quot; with trans people. If you refuse to adopt the vocabulary they want to force on you. If you decline to engage in someone else&#39;s fanciful self-image and grant them the validation they so crave.</p>

<p>A baptist doesn&#39;t give a damn if I&#39;m not baptist.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t be sued or deprived of my livelihood if I don&#39;t attend a Catholic mass.</p>

<p>But cross the gay lobby, and your life is over. They&#39;ll sue you into the ground, and take everything you have. </p>

<p>They&#39;re vastly more vindictive and controlling than any religious person I&#39;ve ever met.</p>

<p>And, as I said, that&#39;s the irony: The religious really ARE protected explicitly by the Constitution. (And gays and trans people aren&#39;t.) Yet gays and trans act as if it&#39;s the opposite. As if the Constitution was built for them as special super-citizens (with extra rights) and the religious are some marginalized group to be attacked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my readings of Nietzeche, he wasn&#39;t a big believer in democracy insofar as it was a race to the bottom. Aristocracy brings out the highest traits in a society. </p>

<p>In a democracy, achievement is stigmatized as &quot;elitist&quot;.</p>

<p>Even the impulse to use the term &quot;elitist&quot; as if it was a bad thing is a sign that democracy favors the broader, lower side of the pyramid; not its apex. </p>

<p>Therefore, democracy transmits the weaker traits in humanity. It encourages mediocrity, rewards bureaucracy, trains people to praise the mob and attack the individual. </p>

<p>A famous quote by Nietzsche: &quot;The surest way to corrupt a youth is to train him to respect people who think alike, rather than people who think differently&quot;.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t like crowds of people who &quot;think alike&quot;. </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t believe in &quot;consensus,&quot; as democracy does.</p>

<p>He believed in the loner, the rebel, the &quot;steppenwolf&quot;. </p>

<p>His whole Superman conception was predicated on this belief-system.</p>

<p>Stronger, superior human beings wouldn&#39;t NEED &quot;systems,&quot; or &quot;isms&quot;.</p>

<p>Such things were for weaklings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>De Tocqueville wasn&#39;t proven wrong, per se. The Anglo-American United States that he was describing manifested exactly the traits he ascribed to it. It&#39;s just that, with time (especially after the death toll of the Civil War), America&#39;s demographics changed as it tried to make up for its slaughtered generation by importing millions of new immigrants.</p>

<p>That fact altered the cultural complexion of the nation.</p>

<p>It was no longer the country that produced the Salem Witch trials, and where Connecticut&#39;s Constitution was made up of scriptures from Leviticus and Deuteronomy. </p>

<p>America (within the same time-period) shifted from an agrarian society to an Industrial society.</p>

<p>All these shifts altered America into an unrecognizable place. </p>

<p>The Salem Witch trials were likely a political tool, one of the original false flags of the US. Read on and you&#39;ll learn of the political context of that time period, and of how such a trial would greatly benefit certain people.</p>

<p>Also ask yourself, why the fuck do we <em>still</em> learn about the Salem Witch trials in school? Why is it still part of the publics consciousness? Or to rephrase, why and who is still pushing this supposed event down our throats?</p>
