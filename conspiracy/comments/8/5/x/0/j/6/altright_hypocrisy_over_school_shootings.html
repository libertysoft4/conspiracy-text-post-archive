<p>Yet we have actual proof of the right doing this and falling for it with Cambridge Anyalitica. Just like with the ReleaseTheMemo twitter campaign being pushed by bots. Same with right wingers sharing and retweeting, now proven, Russian propaganda accounts. </p>

<p>In general the threat of Russian bots and boogeyman pirates hiding under the bed has been greatly over estimated. They&#39;re your neighbors, coworkers, and often Sanders supporters or prior Dems more often than not.</p>

<p>Are you even capable of not talking on hyperbole? You must know of the indictments that show it was a huge state sponsored operation. Which is seperate from the Cambridge Analytica news we&#39;ve recieved. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason the term &quot;equalizer&quot; is used frequently by LEO&#39;s and military personnel.</p>

<p>I would also think the armed security guard thought about the Parkland incident very briefly before engaging. Who wouldn&#39;t in their situation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not exactly bought into the whole crisis actors thing, although the poor kids are being used to some degree, but whatever they are making their mark on the world.<br/>
A few random answers/discussion:<br/>
Conspiracy theory does not equal alt-right.  There are plenty of conspiracy theories against alt-right as well.<br/>
Now, in this case, the shooting you&#39;re referring to today seems pretty cut and dry.   <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/us/maryland-school-shooting-resource-officer-response-trnd/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/us/maryland-school-shooting-resource-officer-response-trnd/index.html</a>
Simple, clean.  We have all parties involved.  Everyone accounted for.  No real questions need answering, we have even a very real motive. Only real question is who shot the assailant, but that&#39;s normal for this time frame, not all details will be released.  This is what a normal information exchange is supposed to look like.<br/>
Vegas, Florida, and others have these seemingly normal questions shrouded in secrecy, which only further engages the conspiracy theoriest (left or right).<br/>
Also, counter to your point, the fact that the MSM isn&#39;t really pushing this story is also somewhat telling.  Granted the article here is from CNN, but I haven&#39;t heard a peep about it on TV.  </p>

<p>Disclaimer: I&#39;m not alt right, whatever that means, and don&#39;t necessarily believe those other incidents are false flags/crisis actor type situations.  I do believe weird shit happened in connection to those other incidents however, which deserve further inquiry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people weren&#39;t &quot;pushing an agenda&quot; that Florida was a false flag. They were pointing out the dozens of things that pointed to the shooting being a false flag, from the many chances authorities had to stop the shooter long before he started shooting, to the armed deputies waiting outside while the shooting went on, to the kids hiding from the shooter in the closet doing anti-gun interviews, to the ready-made media campaign and expensive and highly organized anti-gun protest movement that instantly arose after the shooting, to the key spoke-student&#39;s ties to the media and FBI. And more. Just because Florida shooting was a false flag doesn&#39;t mean that every other shooting will be.</p>

Their actions or lack thereof they may have increased the death toll, but that doesn&#39;t indicate that was the motive.

    <div class="md"><p>They are the groups that frequently push the conspiracy actors debate, but in Maryland they were quick to jump on legitimate shooting stopped by an armed resource officer, and therefore it proves that guns are good and we need more armed people. That is the story they are running with at least this time around. Their opinions change to fit the narrative though, so it is hard to keep up.</p>

<p>I am seriously curious, please do not take offense. Who is in the alt right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You missed the point of the posts. Just because they plan and prepare for accidents, doesn&#39;t mean that they can predict a real life scenario, which everything indicates it actually happened except people from the alt-right pushing gun control conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding as well, you are correct.  It’s not complete apples to apples and it was probably misleading for me to phrase it that way.  There were certainly unique in there own way. </p>

<p>Im mostly just trying to make a point that the difference in the guns used, played a factor.  I don’t think you can compare the two shooting to determine the difference between having unarmed vs armed teachers </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you referring to Richard Spencer ? The alt-right is like the new generation of conservatives that are more technically inclined, but were still raised and brainwashed by racist neoconservative colonialist parents that would often identify with the Tea Party and Alex Jones. I don&#39;t see why that is hard for you to understand?</p>
