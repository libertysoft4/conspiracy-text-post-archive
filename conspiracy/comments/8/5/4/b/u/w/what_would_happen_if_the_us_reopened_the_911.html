<p>The &quot;normal world&quot; is paying close attention to conspiracy for a reason: They know they have a huge skeleton in the closet, and eventually, inevitably, that skeleton is going to be dragged out and put on display.</p>

<p>Why not sooner rather than later?</p>

<p>Edit: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_reconciliation_commission">Truth and Reconciliation process</a> normally expects to hand out pardons and lesser sentences in exchange for truthful testimony. </p>

The dust is gone, the steel is gone, the footage has been collected, witnesses and experts have been killed (IMO).  There is no way to walk this back unless more people are willing to face something so terrible that our own government contributed to killing 3000 innocent civilians.  Who is going to arrest Bush Jr&#39;s cabal?  Those f&#39;ers are untouchable.  What the Bush dynasty doesn&#39;t understand is that the USA will never vote a Bush into office again.  Even people who don&#39;t believe 9-11 know that the Bushes are bad news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When <a href="https://www.livescience.com/56479-americans-believe-conspiracy-theories.html">50% of the American public</a> thinks there&#39;s something wrong with the story behind 9/11, then that&#39;s a pretty good indicator that this can rise above party politics.</p>

<p>We have to assume that the 50% cross all sorts of political divides, and in fact one can sense that in r/Conspiracy itself. There is really very few serious partisan arguments around on the truth of 9/11 official story here. Both left and right - whatever their motive for dropping by - seem to acknowledge the 9/11 event is a real conspiracy.</p>

<p>What was the last time you ran into a sh(r)ill of EITHER persuasion who wanted to argue 9/11 was absolutely what the authorities said it was?</p>

<p>OK, so obviously that would require a whole selection process. We may or may not get help from looking at other Truth &amp; Recon instances to see how they did. This situation is pretty unique.</p>

<p>But we could start by ruling out anybody who could possibly have been involved directly or who could have benefited in any way from 9/11. That would get us a long head start.</p>

<p>We might look for people who have a demonstrated track record for truth-telling, fearless opposition to power when principles are at stake, and just plain old pure and simple wisdom. They gotta be out there. Sure it will be hard. That shouldn&#39;t stop us from trying. </p>
