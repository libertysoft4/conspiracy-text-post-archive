Now here in the UK we do not handle bad weather well. 5cm of snow and it is fucking anarchy. Schools close, airports halt flights, high street retail becomes non existent. It sends us into meltdown basically. </p>

<p>I am sure you are aware of our current dealings with Russia and their nerve agent, we’ll in between all this chaos a thought occurred to me. As a user on here I am sure you are aware of weaponised weather, HARP and Geo-engineering etc and I’d hope you were also aware of the remnants of the Cold War and WW2 that still wage war against each other unbeknownst of the general public and media. Potentiality this snow could be sent from Russia to fuck with our everyday operations?</p>

<p>Hit me with some ideas regarding this issue....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thing here is that if you go back to the 80s and 90s the IRA knew they could call up with a fake bomb scare in the City resulting in buildings being evacuated and loss of revenues. They could shut the City down with just one phone call. This money being lost resulted in pressure on the government to come up with a peace deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an interesting theory. It&#39;s not unusual to see this type of weather at this time of year but it is unusual to see two similar weather systems this close together. The snow was crazy a fortnight ago but doesn&#39;t seem too bad today. So far, anyway. </p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly possible that it&#39;s manufactured weather from Russia. I&#39;m sure people would argue that if it is engineered snow that it would be a LOT worse than the current few wet flakes, but the entire country grinds to a halt under the first CM of snow so it wouldn&#39;t take a lot of it for people to start panic buying milk and flailing their arms around, especially in London. One thing I did notice this morning when it was snowing, that it wasn&#39;t cold. Not like it was 2 weeks ago. It was relatively warm in comparison. That&#39;s generally not a good sign if it&#39;s warm and snowing! </p>

<p>I&#39;m not looking forward to my journey into work tomorrow, the District line is awful even when it&#39;s sunny! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in the late 90’s one of my buddies wondered if it was possible to create a conspiracy theory, so we all tried.  I came up with “The Russian Weather Machine”.  Which was a failed nuclear submarine that created insane heat.  The Russians figured out that towing this thing to spots around the worlds oceans and turning out on, could alter ocean currents and temperatures, changing weather in certain areas of the world.  I guess I was partially correct.  Good on me.</p>
