Mean while we weren&#39;t allowed to talk about Trump or Roger Stone&#39;s shadiness with out being called an shill. This sub became a disinformation hub for the Trump campaign.

    <div class="md"><p>You were allowed to talk about it and anybody can call you out for that if they like. It&#39;s different than insta-banning people based on web-analytics. HRC is essential because of the global connections she has and because there never has been a better chance to strike corruption worldwide then today when they are all implicated by one another in one way or the other.

    <div class="md"><p>Anything criticizing Trump until recently was immediately downvoted to oblivion and anyone challenging his narrative was labeled a shareblue shill. I never saw insta-banning here?? It&#39;s so ironic that you and everyone else were so afraid of HRC&#39;s ability to bot and control the internet when there is heaping piles of evidence that Russian, Kushner and Cambridge Analytics were and probably are doing much more sophisticated stuff. I suspect like almost all Trumpian conspiracy narratives that it&#39;s and intentional form of gas lighting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes Reddit has Instabans which don&#39;t require you to actually post anything. I  also get site-wide ten-minute cooldowns between comments in less controversial subs. But fwiw I can still see vote-manipulation going on here so I really don&#39;t know why you&#39;re talking about it like it&#39;s a thing of the past. I also don&#39;t know why you bring Cambridge Analytics into it because they were just datamining for the election. It&#39;s not like they run social media, they only had read-access to databases. If you are looking at changed content, Spez&#39; editing spree of conservative viewpoints may be a culprit.</p>

I get it that new contributors get certain limits - but what was new even for me is that they started instituting site-wide bans where you don&#39;t just get a cooldown for one sub but for several - but not all.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I just finished this comment. Plenty of examples here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/85nj46/revealed_trumps_election_consultants_filmed/dvz2zkl/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/85nj46/revealed_trumps_election_consultants_filmed/dvz2zkl/</a></p>

<p>The above are examples of possible collusion between the Trump campaign team and Russia. Here&#39;s a good overview of the dossier, which illustrates the connection between it and the above link: <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/1/5/16845704/steele-dossier-russia-trump">https://www.vox.com/2018/1/5/16845704/steele-dossier-russia-trump</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s an article about a second Trump-Russia file that independently confirms the Steele dossier: <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2131283/second-trump-russia-dossier-being-assessed-fbi">http://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2131283/second-trump-russia-dossier-being-assessed-fbi</a></p>

<p>Trump Russia dossier key claim verified: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39435786">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39435786</a></p>

<p>Carter Page&#39;s testimony corroborates key portions of the dossier: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/carter-page-congressional-testimony-transcript-steele-dossier-2017-11">http://www.businessinsider.com/carter-page-congressional-testimony-transcript-steele-dossier-2017-11</a></p>

<p>A lot of the steele dossier has since been confirmed: <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/09/a_lot_of_the_steele_dossier_has_since_been_corroborated.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/09/a_lot_of_the_steele_dossier_has_since_been_corroborated.html</a></p>

<p>r/TopMindsOfReddit, a 70k subscriber sub, are responsible for most, perhaps all of the manipulation over on r/conspiracyundone and are very present here.

Why would you worry about a no power ex politician when the shitbag in the Whitehouse is running the biggest con game in history. Yes they are both corrupt as hell but only one has his finger on the nuke button at the moment. I would suggest that matter is a little more pressing. </p>

<p>Also what Hillary posts get buried? There&#39;s post about her on the front page all the fucking time. How&#39;s she&#39;s a Satanist, pedophile, deep state god. I don&#39;t see any conspiracy about her that&#39;s downvoted right away. Hell her slipping down some steps made the front page the other day. Like this old ass lady falling is news any more.</p>

<p>Update: 36% downvote on this Conspiracy in the subreddit &quot;Conspiracy&quot;... seems unusual.</p>

<p>There&#39;s probably some brigading, but I would also say that the thrice-daily low effort meta complaint posts are also becoming tiresome to a large proportion of the user base, myself included. Except for the ones that present an evidenced package of research on, say, weird user accounts or abnormal patterns. Those are genuinely interesting. </p>

<p>Only posters from The_Donald make anti-Hillary submissions now, everyone else has moved on, or just does not give a fuck about a 2-time loser of a Presidential candidate anymore because she&#39;s irrelevant to the vast majority. </p>
