Was the movie trying to tell us something? Movie reviews of the period were not that positive.  Interesting the fictional country was Bavarian, is there any local legends of an evil ruling class kidnapping kids? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>American banker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Averell_Harriman">Averell Harriman</a>&#39;s banking business was the main Wall Street connection for German companies and the varied U.S. financial interests of Fritz Thyssen; who was a financial backer of the Nazi party until 1938. The Trading With the Enemy Act (enacted on October 6, 1917)[4] classified any business transactions for profit with enemy nations as illegal, and any funds or assets involved were subject to seizure by the U.S. government. The declaration of war on the U.S. by Hitler led to the U.S. government order on October 20, 1942 to seize German interests in the U.S. which included Harriman&#39;s operations in New York City.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also haven&#39;t seen the film in years, but have probably seen it 50 times at least. Btw, all the <em>shitty</em> kids die, and the bad parents are sent on their way in a flippant manner - which I love. Not sure if he adds the dead kids to the candy, but I supposed it could be implied in spots more if I watched it again.</p>

<p>The Slugworth angle is great too, vetting each ticket winner by tempting them to sell the everlasting gobstopper recipe, testing for loyalty, or are they a cheap sellout. All in all, a pretty wholesome message in the end, and a fierce one at that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just got finished reading &quot;Boy&quot; his sorta autobiography to my kid.</p>

<p>He talks about being stuck in these boarding schools and how much the head masters LOVED to paddle their bare bottoms. Some of the scenes are described with blatant sexual imagery about filling his pipe over and over again as he paddled a boy until he bled. It&#39;s really kinda gruesome. Then towards the end he mentions that this real person who was obsessed with paddling young boys rose high in the Vatican and was close to the pope at some point and how he felt it was &quot;very strange that someone like him could rise to such power&quot; with such a nasty side to him and how hypocritical it is, and it even seems he implies that he knows something more about how the abuse might be why...</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find much of it online I&#39;d have to find the chapters in the book itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty whimsical and the only dark parts are really to do with those few scenes where they get unnecessarily paddled. There&#39;s only one scene towards the end that&#39;s mentioned as a side note of something &quot;he heard&quot; that happened. It was a good read for a kid since it has a lot of incredible accounts of life in the early 1900s and how different things were and how highly motivated he and his family were for great things. Pretty inspiring.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>American banker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Averell_Harriman">Averell Harriman</a>&#39;s banking business was the main Wall Street connection for German companies and the varied U.S. financial interests of Fritz Thyssen; who was a financial backer of the Nazi party until 1938. The Trading With the Enemy Act (enacted on October 6, 1917)[4] classified any business transactions for profit with enemy nations as illegal, and any funds or assets involved were subject to seizure by the U.S. government. The declaration of war on the U.S. by Hitler led to the U.S. government order on October 20, 1942 to seize German interests in the U.S. which included Harriman&#39;s operations in New York City.</p>
