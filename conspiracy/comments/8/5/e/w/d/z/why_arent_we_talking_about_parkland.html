        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Three separate teachers and Florida senator Bill Nelson have stated that the shooter was wearing armor, a gas mask, and carrying smoke grenades.

<p>‘Mackenzie, who&#39;d just left the psychology class to use an upstairs bathroom, saw a man with a gun at the other end of the second-floor hallway. Mackenzie said she recognized him.’
&quot;I immediately knew it was him,&quot; she said.

<p>“As we were walking as a class I was actually speaking to the suspect Nikolas Cruz” She told him “I’m surprised you weren’t the one that did it”
“There was definitely another shooter involved”

<p>A student Christina Vega says there were definitely 3 shooters in her very mysterious interview. This interview is nowhere to be found on YouTube anymore 
<a href="http://itshappening.pcriot.com/2018/02/15/parkland-florida-high-school-shooting-three-students-have-testified-there-were-multiple-shooters-yet-no-mainstream-media-outlet-has-picked-it-up/">http://itshappening.pcriot.com/2018/02/15/parkland-florida-high-school-shooting-three-students-have-testified-there-were-multiple-shooters-yet-no-mainstream-media-outlet-has-picked-it-up/</a></p>

<p>Jalen Martin makes vlogs and confirmed he was the one who talked on infowars claiming that the secret service was there weeks before and certain teachers weren’t letting students call home about the shooting 
His channel 
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQS0P4i9myU">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQS0P4i9myU</a>
His interview 
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UtE-pb6hVwg">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UtE-pb6hVwg</a></p>

<p>First responders focused on cutting off traffic and setting up a perimeter rather than rush the building like they are trained they were ordered to not enter the building . Scot Peterson demanded everyone stay 500ft away.
<a href="https://youtu.be/bDDghPsWTUM">https://youtu.be/bDDghPsWTUM</a></p>

<p>The FBI got a tip from someone close to Cruz saying he owns guns, has a desire to kill people, and may shoot up a school. This had to have been deliberately shoved under the rug because it was not their first tip. We all know about the YouTube comment where Cruz directly states he will be a school shooter. Also the Broward County Sheriff’s office displayed disgraceful criminal negligence with the handling of this kid. One caller told the sheriff&#39;s office Cruz is collecting guns and is a “school shooter in the making”
One of his peers reported he was drinking gasoline, cutting himself, and wished to purchase guns
On November 1st Cruz’s aunt called the sheriff&#39;s office “pleading” them to come recover his rifles
The Florida department of Children and Families labeled him a “vulnerable adult due to mental illness” and wants to buy a gun 
A family friend reported that Cruz has put a gun to his brothers and mothers head before which should have gotten him arrested

<p>Glaringly obvious script reading in this fox interview 
<a href="https://youtu.be/bDDghPsWTUM">https://youtu.be/bDDghPsWTUM</a></p>

<p>Any video that contradicts the official narrative is quickly being censored by YouTube. This is unprecedented. Hour long videos and conspiracy documentaries were all over YouTube the months following sandy hook now their deleted. YouTube is in mass censorship mode after this even real student interviews have been deleted If they talk about multiple shooters. </p>

<p>There’s these interviews where kids talk about seeing their teachers and peers shot in the head, dead, or bleeding out. They talk about it like it’s nothing. A kid in my school killed himself this year and his freshman girlfriend had to be sent to a rehab facility in cali and is diagnosed with PTSD she cuts herself and is majorly depressed.  All of his friends still sometimes have to leave school randomly in the middle of the day because they mentally break down and have to see a therapist. All the pictures of David Hogg and them smiling having a good time, knowing that their teenage friends as young as 14  were murdered. The weight something like this has on you dosnt let you eat or think of anything outside the fact that people are dead </p>

<p>Also, this propped up the most organized well articulated anti gun propaganda movement in the days following. We’re seeing nationwide protests of school, this was very well done </p>

<p>You can&#39;t make a bold claim like that and get defensive and pissy when people ask for something to back that up. It&#39;s not healthy to just believe things without evidence so asking for it is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, as long as you&#39;re doing so politely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit like magic and ghosts feel like they always fail to take certain massive, deadly, events into account: War.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s spirits and magical forces affected by massed death or (negative) emotional expression, the battlefield would be a completely different place. Sheer desperation alone would invariably weaponize any <em>actually effective</em> magic, and there&#39;s a LOT of &quot;dying-before-their-time&quot; going down; which according to the popular narrative results in haunts.</p>

<p>Yet history has no commissars sacrificing conscripts to demons/whatever for a last-ditch upper hand in the fight and the streets of Saint Petersburg (Leningrad then) aren&#39;t jam-packed with nightly congregations of the screaming dead even though some 4 million people died terribly over the course of 2.5 years...</p>

<p>As am I, but I don&#39;t think it matters as much in this case. Here we have an actual living suspect (unlike Sandy Hook) who we can assume is a patsy of some kind. There are more than enough, seemingly credible, witness interviews (unlike Sandy Hook) that give credence to the theory that Cruz was either not the shooter or one of many. I&#39;m not completely dismissing the drill theory but I think following the leads in these interviews is a much easier and conclusive road to the truth.</p>

<p>To take it further, lets say a couple of people who were &quot;in&quot; on the Sandy Hook event were told to keep quiet.  They agreed for whatever reason.  They now see this event in Florida and immediately think, oh another staged event with actors.  Don&#39;t you think they would be concerned enough to come forward and tell the wold that this is out of hand and it&#39;s all part of a lie??</p>

<p>I totally agree that something fishy happened in Parkland - I just don&#39;t think actors nor a staged event is the hidden reason.</p>

The point is stuff like this is making progress and a bill like this would have been laughed out of the room a decade ago and now it has serious backers. It’s all an op that will only lead to our rights being taken away. Perhaps guns go the way of airports before the patriot act or something. Nobody wants kids being shot, however, our rights are something we need to protect. It’s all we have in a divide and conquer system. 17 dead kids from a school shooting sucks but you never hear about the 4,000 kids a year that die from texting a driving.

Do the people that think that such a thing can’t be used against them too?  I’m reminded of the guy that was commissioned to create the brazen bull. After he finished it and presented it to the king, the king had him put in it and the fire was lit so the builder was the first subject to be killed inside of it. </p>

They don’t understand the underlying tones because the mainstream media is all they listen too and the “discussion on guns” is all they hear. I like your analogy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Nobody wants kids being shot, however, our rights are something we need to protect. It’s all we have in a divide and conquer system. 17 dead kids from a school shooting sucks but you never hear about the 4,000 kids a year that die from texting a driving. They’re using this as a stepping stone. Don’t let them.&quot;</p>

<p>Not just that. Another odd thing I&#39;ve noticed in the &#39;Let&#39;s ban guns with handles&#39; rhetoric on fb and the MSM is that it has <em>only</em> become about school shootings. Even though there are lots of mass shootings elsewhere. It seems like when most people think &quot;mass shooting&quot; now, they are envisioning it happening at a school. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a little weird to me because I don&#39;t think schools are even the majority of mass shootings, and while terrible because it&#39;s mainly kids at a school, shootings elsewhere are just as terrible. But it&#39;s like people have subconsciously drawn a mental line where regular shootings are ok but school shootings are unacceptable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Copying and pasting a comment talking about this since you brought up Martial law, it was in response to someone talking about how the military has tanks and other highpower weaponry, and asking something along the lines &quot;how would that play out against your semi-auto AR-15?&quot;</p>

<p>(apologies, dont know how to properly quote) 
 <a href="/u/TheGoodJudgeHolden">/u/TheGoodJudgeHolden</a> 
Quite badly for the US military. Illiterate goat herders with Kyber Pass AK&#39;s and HME have been playing havoc with the most technologically advanced and powerful military force in the known world. Proportionally, they have killed and maimed FAR more than any reasonable student of military power would estimate them to be capable of. I know, because I spent 3.5 years fighting them. And the average &quot;gun nut&quot; here in the US has far better tactical small arms than they did/do.</p>

<p>Tank and drones, you say? Sure, no AR can stand against that. But tanks can&#39;t go door to door, taking firearms. You need warm bodies with weapons to do that.</p>

<p>I garuntee you 99% of the military/LEO won&#39;t do this. And the ones that do will face random and unpredictable sniper attacks, or IED&#39;s. There are thousands of Iraq/A-stan veterans like myself that have immense knowledge of IED&#39;s. Hell, I could make them now in my garage(I won&#39;t cause I don&#39;t want to go to the pen)</p>

<p>Even assuming the US gov&#39;t could get enough men to do this, they&#39;re going to cover the hundreds of thousands of square miles of wilderness, hills and mountain hollers? Doing what, exactly? Against some guys that have been waiting for this day there entire lives, and know the terrain like the back of their hand? That&#39;s a nightmare in the making, I saw that in A-stan.</p>

<p>Say they go the &quot;total war&quot; route, and just lay waste, A-10 gun-runs all up and Maple Street USA. They certainly could. Hard to stop that or Apache gunships with small arms. But they wont. Cause who wants to rule and irradiated wasteland? Cockroaches can&#39;t pay taxes. Even then, that&#39;s not a guaranteed win. The Russians tried it in the 80&#39;s in A-stan, send Hind gunships to lay waste to whole villages. Guess who won that dance? Not Ivan, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>In short, the true power of private ownership of weapons doesn&#39;t really lay in the power of the weapons, but the inability to bloodlessly separate the civilians from their arms. It will devolve into a bloody, endless quagmire that&#39;ll make the American Civil War of the 1860&#39;s look like a walk in the park.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen people mention that a few times and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s suspicious for a few reasons.</p>

<p>A) The vest was probably given to the kid as a &quot;just in case&quot; measure. Call it an overprotective parent or something.</p>

<p>B) If the father knew a shooting was going to happen he wouldn&#39;t have allowed the kid to go to school in the first place.</p>

<p>C) Assuming it was a kevlar vest it wouldn&#39;t do anything to protect the kid from an AR-15. He would&#39;ve needed a plate carrier with at least level III+ armor plates which would be impractical to carry around at school every day.</p>

<p>this is simply not true. at least in the case of EMTs.</p>

<p>the first rule of first response for us is BSI scene safety. if the scene is not safe you do not leave you truck. period. otherwise you risk injury to yourself and your partner. its been a couple years since i was in the field and this may be different in the case of a mass casualty situation, but i highly doubt emts/paramedics would be following police into an unsafe situation </p>

<p>as for other first responders such as firemen and police I cannot say. i would imagine firemen have the same rule as us. </p>

<p>but you would think police would be storming the building. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just wondering, if smoke grenades went off in the building, do you know if there would be some kind of chemical evidence, like a residue or something? Not that investigators are really all that interested in collecting that sort of evidence... and not that we would get to see the evidence even if they were interested in collecting it.</p>

<p>Now that I think about it, there should be several pieces of evidence at the eventual trial that we should see:</p>

<ol>
<li>The body armor he supposedly ditched somewhere</li>
<li>The weapon he supposedly ditched somewhere</li>
<li>Chemical residue report from smoke grenades OR undetonated smoke grenades if these were even present.</li>
<li>Testimony from above mentioned witnesses mentioning multiple shooters and describing shooter and body armor.</li>
<li>50-100 empty bullet casings</li>
<li>Documentation of bullet holes from shots that missed or passed through bodies.</li>
</ol>

<p>Something tells me, even if we get to see the trial, we won&#39;t see any of this evidence. And nobody will question it. And this comment will be voted down for even mentioning it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, not holding my breath for one. </p>

<p>That raises an interesting point that I had not thought of before though. Suppose Cruz <strong>was</strong> some kind of agent or employee of the government... He pulls off the shooting or depending on what you believe he just gets picked up for the shooting afterwards... Then he instantly pleads guilty and disappears into the criminal justice system. </p>

<p>Operative word being &#39;disappears&#39;. As in: how do we really know if he is rotting away in a cell somewhere or just back to work at Langley the Monday after the trial? We don&#39;t really, I guess we just have to trust the media to follow up...</p>
