        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>EDIT: The translation has been obtained.</p>

<p>&quot;The consulate informs you that you have an urgent document, which has been sent three times, but unclaimed. This is the last notice. If you need to query please press 2, and a specially-assigned person will serve you.&quot;</p>

<p>A consulate in New York, New York that speaks mandarin? Could it be the Consulate General of the People&#39;s Republic of China in New York? I know I&#39;m probably going out on a limb but who knows at this point.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>I think we all know what I&#39;m talking about when I refer to the &quot;Malaysian Voicemail&quot; incident in the title of my post.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the original thread on twitter, I&#39;ve given it a like there - I&#39;ve seen the summary posts on Facebook, liked and shared there. And nothing has happened to me. Some people are saying that on Facebook, if you share or like it, Facebook sends you a notice about the legality of your content supposedly - which I have not received.</p>

<p>One of my good friends though (I&#39;ll not name names for privacy reasons but we&#39;ll call him J) was introduced to the calamity of all this by his brother who I suppose has been interested in all of this as soon as it started. J, an hour or so after talking about it with me received a call supposedly, someplace from Manhattan (which he didn&#39;t pick up).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the number from that: 212-242-6839</p>

<p>I called the number back just to see (because J wouldn&#39;t do it, he was pretty off put by the whole thing - the operator tells me the number is not available/disconnected.</p>

<p>He says whoever left the voicemail was speaking Chinese (I&#39;m not sure if it was Chinese, his words not mine) but who knows  - I don&#39;t have a recording of that one. </p>

<p>A couple of minutes later, a friend of his brothers (the one who was researching into it all this time) gets supposedly the same message (I don&#39;t know how my friend knows this is the same message if he can&#39;t understand the language, I guess he means it sounds similar). It&#39;s a different number though.</p>

<p>I do have a recording of that one. It might mean nothing, but if someone could interpret this, that would be great. It does have sort of a a loop to it, a noise (like a really slight bell) then the voice again.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s that:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxoKJp0CwxE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxoKJp0CwxE</a></p>

<p>Again, if anybody could possibly interpret that would be fantastic, as I&#39;ve said it might mean nothing but just like an hour after talking about this these messages come through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I can help with this one, but it brings up some scary possiblities, or of course maybe just a simple explanation. I&#39;ve worked in asia extensively and this is a super common scam tactic from fraud gangs in Asia (particularly from China and Taiwan). Since most companies and individuals use various forms of courier services extensively, these outfits often send out these fraudulent emails and calls / voicemails telling you that you have a letter / parcel / etc. that urgently needs to be picked up and to contact so and so. I&#39;ve actually received phone calls from live people to my office saying that they are DHL and that they need information for them to release my parcel (and given that many people often have something incoming they often fall for it easily).</p>

<p>The time I received a live phone call I told the guy to leave his number and extension at DHL and I&#39;d call him back. He hung up. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also received voicemails that purport to be the immigration department of certain countries asking that I contact them for an urgent letter or I will be tagged next time I come into / leave the country. This was publicly announced by said gov&#39;t to be fraud as well.</p>

<p>So this style of message reeks of this type of fraud that is prevalent at least out in Asia. </p>

<p>On the conspiracy side, why is this scary? Because it suggests these fraudulent gangs are gaining access to user information simply through reddit, twitter,your microphone or whatever. If this is true, that means that cyber security and privacy protection is now so easily hacked that even random fraud gangs operating out of an apartment can do it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, although less sexy, you could&#39;ve also just been randomly targeted by a scam group.</p>

<p>Just sharing my experience!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a scam, dude. Not a conspiracy. These are pre-recorded messages that get sent out by computers that generate random phone numbers. A lot of times, they send the messages to phone numbers similar to the generated one.</p>
