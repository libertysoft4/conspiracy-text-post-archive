Like has everyone fucking forgot Reagan, Wilson, Jackson &amp; Nixon. Like Reagan supported/funded Evil Terrorist Dictators, shipped Cocaine into Rural Black Communities &amp; nearly crashed the Savings &amp; Loans Industry. Nixon had the horrible Watergate Scandal, Wilson enslaved us all through Debt with the Federal Reserve Act &amp; Andrew Jackson massacred thousands of natives with the Trial of Tears. Truman nuked an entire city for fuck sakes.</p>

<p>Yet how can people still despite all of this think that Trump is by far the worst? There is something very wrong here</p>

<p>Edit: And no i&#39;m not a Trump supporter, so don&#39;t even bother labelling me as such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh please. You use a term like Trump derangement syndrome and claim you&#39;re not a supporter. It gives you less credibility when you lie like that because those are the only people that use that term. </p>

<p>I was surprised when I first heard the term because it seems to apply to his followers.  They&#39;re a combination of cult members and cheerleaders. They will defend everything he does to a degree that&#39;s irrational. I&#39;ve never worshiped anyone like that. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the worst president ever but it sure seems like that&#39;s his goal. He is the one of the most divisive ever. He&#39;s so blatant at demonstrating he only cares about people that voted for him. </p>

<p>Or maybe i strongly dislike him due to him appointing Jeff Sessions as AG who has a hate boner for pot? Or appointing Betsy DeVos, a moron who bought her position and plans to destroy public schooling. I also strongly dislike him because he is friendly with Goldman Sachs and passed Trickle down economic policy. Trump is also a big proponent of the military industrial complex and the militarization of the police. Stop making dumbass assumptions and actually read the policy criticisms of the trump administration for fucks sake. I simply dont understand how any conspiracy minded person could support him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is not a brilliant propagandist. The media is wholly complicit in manipulating the public with strawman fallacies that every social problem ever has originated with the current puppet-in-chief.</p>

<p>I genuinely doubt OP was insinuating that Trump is beyond reproach. Of course he&#39;s reproachable. What I think OP was getting at is that Trump is hardly the original gangster the media has portrayed him as. He&#39;s a bumbling turd.</p>

<p>Did you see Iron Man 2? Trump is basically the Mandarin. He&#39;s the new OBL. A highly publicized enemy #1 that can be used as a justification for anything from restricting civil rights to starting new global conflicts.</p>

<p>He&#39;s complicit, which mean a lot. But it&#39;s intellectually lazy to attribute the multitude of crimes permitted, endorsed, and committed by the US corporatocracy to a single idiot in a suit. There&#39;s lots of guilty idiots in suits. Probably millions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trump as the Mandarin is more your view of how “non-supporters” view trump than how they actually do. No one thinks he’s the Mandarin lol.</p>

<p>Works for a cool analogy, but I wouldn’t say it fits, however convenient it may be for his reputation. In fact I wouldn’t be surprised if this while, recycled line of thought was actually pushed at some point and that is why you and so many others have such similar things to say about it. Maybe spread on t_d and then from there, or Twitter or 4chan or Q or something.</p>

<p>And it all seems to be to make him seem like he’s “being framed” as the bad guy and he really hasn’t done anything wrong. Really though, there are plenty of things he’s done wrong, and plenty of valid reasons not to like him.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there even needs to be a concerted plan here.  King Cheeto brings a ton of uncertainty and chaos, and in uncertain times people&#39;s thoughts drift towards the worst case scenarios.  That makes good fodder for TV, and the networks are responding to demand.</p>

<p>The Derangement is literally Hillary Clinton throwing a hissy fit and demanding the rest of the country go along with her, placate her, etc.</p>

<p>There are of course a lot of reasons to really hate Trump, like the fact that he&#39;s a fucking moron and that his supporters are some of the stupidest chumps to ever live, and I have no patience for the idiotic feefees of racists.  However, the neoliberals and faux-progressives, under a thin veneer, actually agree with Trump&#39;s racism, so long as a few representatives of minority groups are elevated; the failure to attack Trump on that basis is largely because, deep down, even the so-called progressives can&#39;t question their racism, their fascism, and their shitty notions of political economy.  Thus, the only avenue of attack is to scream about Russians and make up total nonsense.  If this society were not beyond hope, Trump would have been laughed out of the room, not coddled and given a stream of free advertisement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just talking to a coworker about this. How the media is using the trump thing to further divide us on the political spectrum. “Trump has a nuclear button he’s about to explode on North Korea” now it’s all “trumps a piece of filth for negotiating peace with NK”</p>

<p>Focusing on the boogeyman to distract us from the corruption in the system as a whole amongst other things. Trump may have not been “supposed” to win, but TPTB are definitely using him regardless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only person with &quot;derangement syndrome&quot; is Trump himself.</p>

<p>But the OP is correct, there are many shithead leaders throughout US history. So this is a good place and time to not allow openly corrupt and ignorant politicians to get away with things. </p>

<p>Therefore Trump, his family and any Republican who assists their criminal behavior need to face the harshest legal penalties possible. No plea deals should be offered and maximum sentences should be demanded. Public corruption should not be tolerated or ignored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you know about  political economy, you tend to view political decisions as the outcomes of the influence of most powerful groups within  the society.  </p>

<p>The range of policies are dictated within the competing groups who can project power. You are looking at various super rich oligarchs and their allies most of the time.</p>

<p>As a result, you would tend to downplay the significance of a president on actual policy.  For example, one can note that foreign policy has continued the same goals and strategies from George Bush through to Obama - because the donor class that can buy elections  is more or less united. </p>

<p>Much has been written about how Obama in particular in no way lived up to his anti war posturing during his first campaign.  Does it make sense to measure the presidents as better or worse without knowing what the political pressures they faced were? </p>

<p>Trump is something of anomally  because his campaign  was not supposed to win I would argue.</p>

<p>The msm gave Trump an enormous amount of coverage during the primaries (estimates run about 8 billion in free advertising)  and wound up giving him a.surprising amount of momentum. </p>

<p>But as many have suggested - and I believe it&#39;s correct - the political allies  who help pave the way for Trump as  the republican nominee blundered.</p>

<p>They overestimated their candidate (Clinton) and failed to appreciate how someone as cynical and unscrupulous as Trump could be a threat in a campaign by being a fake populist. </p>

<p>He could blithly make policy claims that no one inside the political classes would believe were feasible. So much so, that various politicos suggested Trump himself did not expect to win.</p>

<p>To the extent that Trump had not embraced key neocon policy outcomes regarding Russia and  the future of the Middle East, he became a potential threat to core  policy goals where untold trillions could  hang in the balance.</p>

<p>The idea of detente with Russia was surprisingly well received during the election campaign and it became critical that Trump have no opportunity to undo neo con gains.  The public sympathy to such ideas had to be shattered.</p>

<p>Trump immediately became the target of relentless campaign of attacks, and of course so did Russia. </p>

<p>Fortunately for neocons Trump provides so much potential fodder for scandal, it makes their job almost too easy. And I suppose you could say the same for Russia. </p>

<p>From my point of view, the last election and it&#39;s fallout showed more than ever before just how deeply corrupt politics is in the US today.</p>

<p>The role of foreign money in politics, secret and illegal lobbists, and the potential access of criminal classes to the highest levels of government, the astounding level of dirty tricks and smear campaigns coming from for foreign actors and the surveillance state.  </p>

<p>This is the new norm and I can&#39;t see it getting any better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People complained about the people you mentioned too. Why should everyone stop complaining cause someone new is in? </p>

<p>There were many who complained openly about Kennedy (this one was hated so badly someone shot him), Nixon, Reagan etc. You name the president, there were complaints.</p>

<p>As for the media manipulating people, I don&#39;t think the media has anything to do with Donalds tweets. </p>

<p>I tend to judge a persons character by their outward facade. How they handle a crisis, the things they uphold, who or what values they defend etc. None of that can be swayed by the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can’t blame people for disliking him IF they’re only source of information is Television news. They all bash on him EVEN Fox sometimes. The media strictly focuses on the negatives only because that’s what they’re paid to do. Haven’t you noticed, Isis is practically dead but there isn’t a PEEP about it. Oh yea, because then they’d have to give credit to Trump and that is their last priority, so, they’d rather focus on a tweet he posted 2 years ago. </p>

<p>Stop listening to these obsessed, tantrum-throwing toddlers. It’s obvious none of them know a damn thing about politics, history,  optics, laws, or investigations - on either side. They just want what they want when they want it. </p>

<p>Say what you will about Trump: he certainly knows how to play TDS to his advantage. I mean, at this point, his tv ratings are still higher than anything Hollywood can produce. 🤣</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel about the same as I did back during Obama days. Bewildered and confused at how people could warp reality around them to become apart of such obvious manufactured outrage, and then step back and laugh at the other crowd when you switch sides.</p>

<p>I was not nearly as politically informed or mature as now, and still have a ways to go, but at the time I figured Obama <em>had</em> to be better than McCain or Romney. I bought onto all the initial selling points - I liked that he was black which was bringing diversity to American politics in at least one unprecedented manner which I viewed as 
good for its own sake at the time (how naive I was...) </p>

<p>Building to the eventual point... I was never 100% in support of Obama, I missed being able to vote the first time around by a matter of months and by the next election I was in Gary Johnson territory ideologically. All this being said, I looked at the mainstream right/conservatives as the same way they viewed Obama - With complete and outright disgust. </p>

<p>This is nothing new, the only difference is that the left hold greater footing in the media industry so they are controlling <em>most</em> of everything we get to hear. And what they want people to hear is what they believe - A misogynistic, racist, fascist, arrogant blowhard who only seeks to serve and provide to those in his class is running the country. That&#39;s not very far from exactly what conservatives were calling Obama without very much good reason (just replace fascist with socialist - Hell, even some people were calling him a fascist socialist which is funny.)</p>

<p>Now the major difference between the two situations is that this time around the left is extremely sour after having lost Her Chance to literally the most ill-conceived victor they could have ever hoped to lose to, so they are falling back on Cold War era tactics to try and actively push a narrative to subvert the Presidency. </p>

<p>I could give a shit about Trump being President, and honestly in any situation where someone besides Clinton or Pence might be an option I&#39;d likely hop on it. When you start utilizing the media to mobilize the masses to the drums of bitterness and resentment towards your own people - This is where things have become different.</p>

<p>This is where I start worrying.</p>
