        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-03-19 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/neckbeardgamers.html">neckbeardgamers</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Recently even one of Reddit&#39;s founders, Steve Huffman wrote an announcement complaining <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/">about Reddit&#39;s alleged Russian bot/troll problem.</a> After <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/dvb8uhs/">examining some of the sources</a> of the pro-Hillary, American Democratic whiners that keep this myth alive, I found that the allegedly powerful Internet Research Agency of Russia with its puny $1.25 million monthly budget <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download">is directed toward domestic and international audiences</a> and thus even all that small million dollar sum wasn&#39;t directed to interfering in the 2016 American election. Meanwhile <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-did-russian-interference-affect-the-2016-election/">the Clinton campaign spent $1.2 billion and the Trump campaign $612 million</a>, so by comparison even if Russia invested $1.25 million solely into the American election, it still wouldn&#39;t influence much. Infact on Reddit the only thing I have noticied time and again is that on almost every subreddit if you don&#39;t simply circlejerk against Russia and support the media war mongering against Russia, it will be bad for your karma and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130214071406/http://jeffdechambeau.com/redditing-to-the-mean.html">&quot;because having higher karma is desired, users behave in ways that will get them karma&quot;</a>, which in this case involves bashing Russia. In my real life workplace and day to day conversation there is no concern for finding a Russian under everyone&#39;s bed contrary to this internet political discussion furor. </p>

<p>All that Russia misdirection has allowed the arguable largest national vote brigading and botting group to get far, far less attention than they deserve: the Turkish brigaders, trolls and botfarms. In thread after thread I noticie the top voted comments are mostly Turks having a monologue with other Turks, it is a surreal and pathetic scene:   </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/85a3q3/turkishbacked_forces_have_taken_full_control_of/">https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/85a3q3/turkishbacked_forces_have_taken_full_control_of/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/83lvb0/turkish_mosque_attack_with_molotov_cocktails_in/">https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/83lvb0/turkish_mosque_attack_with_molotov_cocktails_in/</a></p>

<p>Practially all of <a href="/r/syriancivilwar">/r/syriancivilwar</a>(a really shitty ultra-censoring sub full of mostly nerds thousands of miles away) and <a href="/r/combatfootage">/r/combatfootage</a> is a never ending Turkish state propaganda wankfest ever since Turkey invasion of Afrin dubbed with the Orwellian title &quot;Operation Olive Branch&quot; started. </p>

<p>Have Russia/Russians ever been able to turn <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, <a href="/r/europe">/r/europe</a> into circlejerks of their state&#39;s official talking points as much? Russia may have a weak and tentative state social media program, but the actual Russian population is not fanatic to turn into millions of footsoldiers for the program. Russia also cannot get 20,000-40,000 people in Germany to attend a Putin rally, but <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/erdogan-demos-and-counterprotests-put-cologne-on-edge/a-19440544">the fanatic Turkish diaspora can turn out those numbers when Erdogan visits the Turkish immigrant colonists of Germany</a> who have no intention of assimilating. Turkey has a state social media program and the ultra-nationalist population to back it up. To give an idea of how fanatic the Turkish population is, watch this old AKP election video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80J0FCe69to">Millet Eğilmez.</a> A <a href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/02/02/the-turkish-complex/">text description by the anthropologist Jenny White</a> who focuses on Turkey:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The AKP video for the 2014 local election showed a mysterious stranger in a foreign-looking trench coat cutting the rope that held up an enormous Turkish flag. As the falling flag’s ominous shadow floated across the land, citizens of every persuasion began to run toward the flagpole, masses of them diving into the Bosphorus to swim to the flag’s rescue. In a chilling special-effects ending, citizens swarm on top of each other to create an enormous cone-shaped hive, seen from the sky. One young man, his face aglow with fervor, climbs on the backs of the others to the top of the pile and grabs the broken end of the rope, flinging himself outward to certain death while pulling the flag back up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That election video presented the Turkish population as a fanatic zombie like mass or Zerg herd(Starcraft) and it actually worked, in Turkey. While in Western societies it would have backfired for insulting the nation as a fanatic, dumb mass. But Turks are proud to be a fanatic, ignorant, ultra-nationalist, bloothirsty mob so it worked! And that is also why the Turkish state&#39;s social media efforts are much more effective and potent on Reddit than Russia&#39;s or those of other nations. Turkey has massively insulted almost every country with its diplomacy and engaged in patently hostile actions in an official matter against almost every Western country that matters, and yet on a Western dominated medium like Reddit, Turkish brigaders, trolls and bots are amazingly able to bully their positions through again and again. Here is just a small fraction of the articles about the Turkish state&#39;s inverventions on the internet:  </p>

<p>Time and time again, whenever I try to counter Turkish propaganda on Reddit my posts are deleted and very funny activities happen with voting: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7x8ea2/rturkey_captured_flag_of_greekgreek_cypriot/">https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7x8ea2/rturkey_captured_flag_of_greekgreek_cypriot/</a></p>

<p>(I would cite more but even ceddit is not indexing a lot of the deletions...)</p>

<p>Recently I had an accidental hint at what is really happening behind the scenes. A while ago I read a great article about [the Turkish embassy in Belgium being the source of threats to journalists in that country(<a href="https://stockholmcf.org/turkish-embassy-turns-out-to-be-source-of-threats-sent-to-journalists-in-belgium/)(mostly">https://stockholmcf.org/turkish-embassy-turns-out-to-be-source-of-threats-sent-to-journalists-in-belgium/)(mostly</a> Turkish ones) and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/7tgohb/turkish_embassy_turns_out_to_be_source_of_threats/">posted it to /r/belgium.</a> It seemed to be very welcomed by the actual userbase there, infact if you check the related discussion tab, after I posted that article on their own several people who frequent that sub reposted the same article to other subs. I checked the post history of one of the Erdogan shills on that thread and got a brief glimpse at what is the real power of Turkish partisans, of Reddit, they don&#39;t care about free speech in any sense and are willing to censor their oponnents. I found that an Islamist Kosovo Albanian &quot;Ottoman seed leftover&quot; and self proclaimed Erogan fan created a thread to not only censor that thread but to get mods to filter the media source I posted in the future! </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/belgiummeta/comments/7tm8tb/turkish_embassy/">/r/belgiummeta: Turkish embassy </a></p>

<p>Dear mods,</p>

<p>I urge you to check the source of that post, and ponder whether such propaganda could not be considered &#39;haat zaaien&#39; when paired with the message it delivers concerning a large portion of the migrant population of the country this subreddit represents.</p>

<p>This is nothing more than slander en masse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as usual on Reddit the useless waste of space mods instead of defending free speech, instead felt powerful and haughty at being presented yet another chance to abritrate what information we should or should not be able to access since they already accidently stumbled on internet power and authority that most of them anyway shouldn&#39;t have:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The source of that post seems to be a propaganda outlet, yeah. I&#39;ll start up a discussion with the other mods whether or not we should start filtering out such content - same with the Gatestone Institute article posted earlier.</p>

<p>Most users on r/belgium seem to be critical enough to spot propaganda when they see it, but it&#39;s still annoying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you go on that meta thread you will be greeted with the familiar [deleted] seen all over on Reddit... On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdC_Cu9X4wc">Youtube biased Tyrone posted a hilarious critique of 4chan janitors(which is their term for mods)</a> that applies equally well to Reddit mods: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is a janitor on the internet, on an anime image board. He does it for free. He takes his job very seriously. He does because it is the only amount of power and control he will ever have in his pathetic life. He deletes threads he doesn&#39;t like, because whenever he gets upset he has an asthma attack. He deletes threads he doesn&#39;t like because they interfer with the large backlog of inter-Chinese girl cartoons he still has to watch. He will never have a real job. He will never move out of his parent&#39;s house. He will never be at a healthy weight. He will never know how to cook anything besides a Hot Pocket[American microwaveable sandwhich pocket]. He will never have a girlfriend. He will never have any friends. ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed the German Marshall Fund recently published the results of shocking study that shows how rooted the Turkish penchant for totalitarianism against the Turkish political party that Turkish citizens feel most distant to is:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.gmfus.org/publications/dimensions-polarization-turkey">German Marshall Fund: Dimensions of Polarization in Turkey</a></p>

<p>About half of the respondents supported wiretapping the phones of supporters of the “other party,” and 37 percent said they are against participation of the members of this group in elections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience most Reddit mods are the social losers of the West and should not even hold the internet authority they do. So when Turks massively complain and report posts instead of that making them angry at Turkish attempts of censorship and instead of them taking action against constantly reporting whiners turning Reddit into a shithole of threads full of the word [deleted], they instead feel an ego boost as the Turkish complaints recognize their authority to delete material! Indeed there is even some Greek loser neckbeard mod that only posts mostly about vidya games and to janitor on <a href="/r/europe">/r/europe</a>, <a href="/u/greekball">/u/greekball</a> who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/7vcapb/here_lies_the_patriots_hopes_and_dreams_for_super/dts2u14/">frequently reports my posts again and again with the goal of getting me banned from Reddit subs and Reddit.</a> In the glory days of the pre-Reddit internet during the &quot;phpbb era&quot; on the better forums such whiners would be looked at as vermin but those cowards are the probably the secret to why Reddit discussion after discussion is full of [deleted] comment chains.  </p>

<p>Now I cannot prove that appealing to the vanity and authority of Reddit&#39;s neckbeard mods is why Turkish vote brigaders are so successful on Reddit, but it is a start. </p>

<p><strong>Why do you guys think the Turks are able to bias Reddit so easily?</strong> </p>

<p>Aside:<br/>
Isn&#39;t pathetic <a href="/u/kn0thing">/u/kn0thing</a> suppossed to be half-Armenian, shouldn&#39;t he be concerned that the nation that committed and denies the Armenian genocide is so easily able to game Reddit again and again? Instead of talking about that publicly, Reddit is co-operating with the Western mainstream media in looking for a Russian under everyone&#39;s bed... I have yet to found a Russian there despite what the corporate controlled media war-mongers write. </p>

<p>Like the Western corporate, mainstream media Reddit too is obsessed with a &quot;Russian under every bed.&quot; Despite the hysteria, I don&#39;t notice Russian viewpoints getting any traction on this medium, all I notice instead is Turkish vote brigaders, trolls, etc. I posit that the eery success of Turkish viewpoints on Reddit is due to the Reddit Turks jibbing well with the vanity or Reddit&#39;s ultra-nerd moderators. Turks have to be massively using the report function of Reddit as even the German Marshall Fund indicates more than 1/3rd of Turks think the supporters of the Turkish political party they hate the most shouldn&#39;t be allowed to vote.  Instead of defending free speech, Reddit&#39;s cancerous neckbeard mods feel empowered by the constant Turkish reports to censor comments and ban users and take censoring action. </p>

<p>Oh wow, so the Russian agency that pathetic whining propagandists like you complain about that has the mission to influence domestic Russian and international opinion has hundreds of employees. Well I am sure that led Clinton to lose an election in a monstrous large and powerful country of 300+ million where billions are spent on Presidental elections! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the mainstream media lies by being massively pro-Turkish and cowing to Turkish demands as if Turkey is some uber powerful country they are helpless to stop. Back in 2008 Turkey was still the same country full of ultra-nationalist, miserable scum that hate and genocide Western values. </p>

<p>Have you heard the news? A group of high school kids from Kırşehir, a central Anatolian city, sent a special Turkish flag to the commander in chief of the Turkish military, Gen. Yaşar Büyükanıt. What made the flag special was the stuff it was made of. The red color in the background was not any ordinary paint. It was literally the blood of these students, which they had joyfully spilt to symbolize their devotion “to the homeland.”</p>

<p>According to the daily Bugün, which ran the news from its headline yesterday, Gen. Büyükanıt was deeply touched by this present. In a public speech, he mentioned it as symbolic of the fact the whole nation is ready to “spill its blood for the sacred cause of our national unity.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That made zero international headlines that the head of the fake secular TSK lionized a flag that idiot fanatic Turkish high school drew with their actual own blood(the Turkish flag is red). But when Erdogan traumatized a Turkish girl by saying she could be a martyr for the Turkish military:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/world/europe/turkey-erdogan-girl-martyr.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/world/europe/turkey-erdogan-girl-martyr.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It received massive coverage. Why the discrepancy for two very similar actions? Well it is a difference in timeline. Today Western leaders realize in the future Turkey be the next Iran with the constant virulent anti-Western rheteric of Turkish politicians, media, etc, so they magnify news against Erdogan and Turkey. In 2008 the West they still had hopes that the Turkish Republic would carry their dirty water. But the war mongering and anti-human stances of General Büyükanıt who was the imagined defender of secular Kemalism on the blood flag his alleged polar opposite, Islamist Erdogan on the crying girl not happy by the news she could be a  future martyr for the Turkish Armed Forces were not different in any substance. </p>

<p>Since you want to be a propagandist can you present any positive news on that fanatic hovel of a country? For I find little that is worthy of praise there. </p>

<p>This is an old post I wrote that gives just a tiny glimpse of how much the AKP regime lies about key indicator indicators:     </p>

<p>But the Turkish government lies all the time and their GDP figure and economic growth figures are all lies. These are the games that the AKP plays with GDP calculations:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/opinion/gunes-komurculer/questions-regarding-turkeys-revision-in-gdp-calculations-107364">http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/opinion/gunes-komurculer/questions-regarding-turkeys-revision-in-gdp-calculations-107364</a></p>

<p>December 16 2016 </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>With the new calculation method, on Dec. 12, some 80 million Turks got a nearly 20 percent boost to their average standard of living – on paper at least. TÜİK said the 2015 GDP stood at $861 billion, from $720 billion before the revision – adding $141 billion to the size of the economy virtually overnight. The growth over the previous decade now averages more than one percent compared to the previous calculations. </p>

<p>In 2006 the AKP liars pulled the same stunt:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turkey revises 2006 GDP up 31.6 percent   </p>

<p>The Turkish Statistics Institute (TURKSTAT) revised the country&#39;s 2006 gross domestic product up 31.6 percent to 758 billion lira ($526 billion), the institute&#39;s chairman Omer Demir said on Saturday. 2006 GDP was previously reported as 576 billion lira, he said. (UPDATED)</p>

<p>...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will not included that link as the crappy Reddit automod deletes automatically all posts linking to that Turkish source. </p>

<p>Another good article where a Western economist, Erik Meyersson looking at freight traffic, energy consumption, construction permits, bank loans shows the AKP is likely lying with their reports of high economic growth, because it is not consummate with those aforementioned indicators:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://erikmeyersson.com/2017/02/16/will-the-real-real-gdp-in-turkey-please-stand-up/">https://erikmeyersson.com/2017/02/16/will-the-real-real-gdp-in-turkey-please-stand-up/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Turkish economist, Dani Rodrik destroys the AKP myth that Turkey is gaining ground economically vis a vis the rest of the world under their rule:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2015/04/turkish-economic-myths.html">http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2015/04/turkish-economic-myths.html</a></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>First, let’s dispense with some misconceptions about how well the Turkish economy did under Erdogan. As the chart below shows, Turkey’s growth performance since 2002 (when AKP took over) has been middling. A 50% increase in per-capita GDP (at constant prices) is nothing to scoff at, but it is below what Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, Ghana, Indonesia, Philippines and many others – not to mention China and India – have achieved. (And no, Turkey’s income did not triple over this period, as government officials claim.) </p>

<p>..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More from Rodrik, as he points out when you compare Turkey to its developing nation competitors, not the developed world, Turkish GDP growth is anemic by comparison and Turkey is actually losing ground to its closest economic rivals:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2013/06/how-well-did-the-turkish-economy-do-over-the-last-decade.html">http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2013/06/how-well-did-the-turkish-economy-do-over-the-last-decade.html</a></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The Turkish government likes to claim that the GDP expanded by more than three-fold between 2002 and 2012. This is a misleading number, as it is based on the dollar valuation of Turkish GDP at current prices, and hence lumps both dollar inflation and the real appreciation of the Turkish lira on top of real growth. Calculated properly, real GDP (or GDP at constant prices) rose by 64 percent during 2002-2012, and real GDP per capita by 43 percent.* </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>However, an important issue that is frequently overlooked is the conjunctural and comparative dimension. The last decade has been an exceptionally good one for developing countries as a whole. When Turkey’s performance is compared to the average for emerging and developing countries, it hardly looks distinguished. This can be seen from the figure below.</p>

<p>The figure shows that Turkish performance lagged significantly behind emerging and developing economies as a group. In the latter, real GDP rose by 95% compared to Turkey’s 64%.  Real GDP in large emerging markets such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia all grew more rapidly than Turkey, as it did in many smaller African and Latin American countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind he is not questioning the official figures given by the Turkish government that much compared to Meyersson. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, it’s small as compared with the campaigns. The Clinton campaign and Clinton-backing super PACs spent a combined $1.2 billion over the course of the campaign. The Trump campaign and pro-Trump super PACs spent $617 million overall.</p>

<p>Also look at the original justice department document instead of the pro Killary Klinton whining and spinning media you probably prefer:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So in a campaign where Hillary Clinton&#39;s team alone spent $1.2 billion you want to complain that a Russian agency that deals with social media campaigns in Russia and the whole word that has a meanly $1.2 monthly budget(or $15 million yearly) and act like Russia stole the election from Hillary or was more than a fart in the election? </p>

<p>Really when did this sub become so pathetic and canvassed by Hillary koolaid drinkers and people who buy the stupid shit the media spins about the allegedly all powerful IRA even after its puny budget is revealed? And when did Reddit in general become such a shithole where it is just a battle of various blind, ignorant shills who are very dumb and ignorant, but there is a lot of them, so not matter what intelligent reply you could craft is more time wasted since it will buried and the idiot groups will always win? </p>

<p>Infact there is massive evidence Hillary Killton&#39;s campaign even canvassed Reddit:  </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16621890">Interesting Turkey + Facebook collusion anecdote</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>have a personal story from inside facebook to share. and when I shared this story on my facebook my personal facebook was suspended too.</p>

<p>5 years ago Facebook recruiter reached out to me and invited me to the W hotel in Chicago. I was very excited -not for the job- but for the opportunity to meet with senior Facebook managers and tell them about an evil thing Facebook does. Here is the background story:</p>

<p>I am Kurdish from Iran. And Iran has many provinces. one of them is called Kurdistan. In Facebook profile section for Hometown you could pick all of the Iranian provinces except Kurdistan.</p>

<p>And at first I thought it was a bug. For years and years we submitted bug reports and collected petitions for Facebook they never responded why the Kurdistan province cannot be picked while other provinces could be picked.</p>

<p>Till one day, An internal document -guidance- leaked out of Facebook. That explained it all ! One of the pages was talking about Kurdistan. In which they had explained any reference to Kurdistan is considered terrorism. That was on the request of Turkish government.</p>

<p>In &quot;Turkey&quot;, the word Kurdistan is forbidden. and many people in Turkey been prisoned for speaking Kurdish. however in &quot;Iran&quot; we officially have a province called &quot;Kurdistan Province). and Iranian government recognizes the name Kurdistan for my homeland. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Iran">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Iran</a></p>

<p>But Facebook decided to enforce the Turkish government racist rule on other countries that have Kurdistan (Iran, Iraq, Syria...)</p>

<p>Also in that leaked guidance memo. Kurdistan flag was considered illegal. And hundreds of Kurdish pages and accounts got banned for having Kurdistan flag.</p>

<p>While Kurdish flag is illegal in Turkey. Kurdish flag is officially recognized in the Constitution of Iraq for Kurdistan regional government.</p>

<p>So when they invited me to W Hotel to recruit me. I was like yes finally I can meet the people in person. Because as a Kurd I have no importance and they will never respond to me but a software engineer I am pretty attractive on the market.</p>

<p>So I asked the question from one of the managers. And told them my story this for years and years I send them emails and nobody got back to me and we made petitions about this so-called bug.</p>

<p>He said these things are decided by higher management.</p>

<p>I told him how often do you show this disagreement to higher managers or Mark Zuckerburg&#39;s policies if you have a different opinion. He responded if I disagree with them I wouldn&#39;t work there.</p>

<p>I left the W Hotel in Chicago 5 years ago refusing to proceed with a job on FB. I knew Facebook is on the wrong path. And today I see that prediction coming true.</p>

<p>Even today when Turkey committed a massacre in Kurdish city of Afrin, Facebook blocked many voices inside the city who were showing massacres by Turkish government.</p>

<p>10 years ago FB came after kurds and you said not my problem. Today they are coming after all of u</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the additional info, you one of the only good faith res-ponders in this now quite miserable sub. Yes the bullying, ultra-aggressive, muslim josh mentality of the Turkish government combined with the pathetic policy of large Wester corporations to put $$$ above allegedly sacrosanct Western values also accounts for the huge power of the Turkish state narrative on the net. A twitter I follow recently linked to this article about how the totalitarian Turkish state bought Sandvine/Procera Networks Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) devices and FinFisher “lawful intercept” spyware install nation state backed malware on Turkish citizens pcs(they probably most heavily targeted supporters of the Kurdish national movement) and even neighboring Syrians:   </p>

<blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<p>Through Internet scanning, we found deep packet inspection (DPI) middleboxes on Türk Telekom’s network. The middleboxes were being used to redirect hundreds of users in Turkey and Syria to nation-state spyware when those users attempted to download certain legitimate Windows applications.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>We found that a series of middleboxes on Türk Telekom’s network were being used to redirect hundreds of users attempting to download certain legitimate programs to versions of those programs bundled with spyware. The spyware we found bundled by operators was similar to that used in the StrongPity APT attacks. Before switching to the StrongPity spyware, the operators of the Turkey injection used the FinFisher “lawful intercept” spyware, which FinFisher asserts is sold only to government entities.</p>

<p>Targeted users in Turkey and Syria who downloaded Windows applications from official vendor websites including Avast Antivirus, CCleaner, Opera, and 7-Zip were silently redirected to malicious versions by way of injected HTTP redirects. This redirection was possible because official websites for these programs, even though they might have supported HTTPS, directed users to non-HTTPS downloads by default. Additionally, targeted users in Turkey and Syria who downloaded a wide range of applications from CBS Interactive’s Download.com (a platform featured by CNET to download software) were instead redirected to versions containing spyware. Download.com does not appear to support HTTPS despite purporting to offer “secure download” links.1</p>

<p>Absolutely there are regular users here. But bot karma gets reversed. My comments in the last few hours have not all been upvoted 30+ times. That&#39;s bot karma. This thread? It was at 12% upvoted at one point. Now it&#39;s on the front page. Every single comment on this thread, regardless of opinion or support, was below -15.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I&#39;m calling bots because I&#39;ve spoken with reddit admins and they&#39;ve confirmed there are bots in use. I will repeat from my previous comment. All comments in a thread do not drop below the comment threshold without botting. Comments on this sub do not gain 40 points in an hour. When all my comments (even on other subreddits) go down to -20 at the same time, that&#39;s not regular people. You don&#39;t see karma scores, the mod team can.</p>

<p>And: </p>

<p>Point me to one instance when a Kurd used bots to downvote entire threads to -30. Just one. You won’t be able to. I hate talking like this, and the other mods can testify, but there is absolutely no comparison to what has happened to the sub in the past two months. There had been huge vote brigading on this sub. When a propaganda picture of some random special forces soldier gets to 120 points in three hours, but YPG ATGM videos are never getting past 65% upvotes. There’s a problem. ...</p>

<p>I have never seen brigading as blatant and obvious as with what has happened in the last few months. There are bots assigned to downvote posts from pro-YPG sources instantly. There are bots assigned to several pro-Turkish users (who are longtime good and civil contributors) that upvote their stuff automatically. There are tons of reports every day that are extremely racist against Kurds. People like u/dodo91 had bots attached to his account downvoting literally every comment to ~-40. u/HenryPuot had (and probably still has) a report bot attached to his account. There is a concentrated level of trolling on this sub that hasn’t been seen since the Russian intervention. The pro-Kurdish circlejerk could get bad at times, yes. But we never had them mass-reporting things they didn’t like in attempts to get people banned outside of a few exceptions I can count on one hand. We never had bot armies downvoting posts they didn’t like so they never reached the front page. We never had dozens of alt accounts constantly send harassing messages to pro-Turkish users. We never had numerous posts of goreposting memes from them.</p>

<p>I hate that I have to even explain this. It is completely evident what is causing problems on this sub.</p>

<p>Yeah the admins can see who does the downvoting and they ban those accounts. Sometimes they IP ban, though the users get around it easy, most in Turkey already have VPNs. But there&#39;s a lot of bots. At least 30 are in use right now. There&#39;s also report brigading going on.   </p>

<p>Normal users? No. But with bots yes. Remember, every user banned can&#39;t upvote or downvote. The admins were quick to act just an hour ago when I got some bots. Hopefully the same thing happens here.</p>

I agree. This is getting ridiculous. Some comments here are at -20. I&#39;ve already got one set of bots banned today. God willing more will come now. On the bright side, it gets reversed after like 8 hours.</p>

<p>Heads up. People either have bots assigned to you( <a href="/u/flintsparc">/u/flintsparc</a> ) or are downvoting everything on your account. This was at -2 before I approved it.   </p>

<p>And you don&#39;t see any pro Russian view points lol</p>

<p>The Hillary/Trump hundreds of millions you quote are for the entire campaign, that&#39;s t-shirts, flags, venues etc etc not specifically all for electronic shit.</p>

<p>The IRA has hundreds of employees and they&#39;re pretty good at mixing in, they definitely influenced people.</p>
