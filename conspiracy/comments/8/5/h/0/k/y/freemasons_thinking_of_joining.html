    <div class="md"><p>Oh, Jesus Christ.  You people and your ignorance about the Jesuits.  The Freemasons were at one point an openly anti-Catholic fraternity, which led the Church (1) to make it an ex communicable offense for a Catholic to join the Freemasons; and (2) to create the Knights of Columbus, which is a Catholic fraternal organization akin to the Freemasons.  The Jesuit Order is not only a Catholic order of priests, but historically the redheaded step-child of the Catholic Church because (1) they believe that educating the masses is a good thing; and (2) they don’t unhesitatingly take the knee to Rome.  Contrary to what Jack Chick and Malachi Martin may have told you, they’re not Rome’s secret paramilitary world domination black ops group, they aren’t Satinists, and everyone who graduated from a Jesuit high school or university isn’t a Jesuit.</p>

<p>Jesuits are thus sometimes referred to colloquially as &quot;God&#39;s soldiers&quot;,[5] &quot;God&#39;s marines&quot;,[6] or &quot;the Company&quot;, which evolved from references to Ignatius&#39; history as a soldier and the society&#39;s commitment to accepting orders anywhere and to endure any conditions.[7] The society participated in the Counter-Reformation and, later, in the implementation of the Second Vatican Council.</p>

At the deeper levels, at the top of the pyramid, so to speak, things get a <em>lot</em> stranger and quite a bit muddier.</p>

<p>A good portion of the upper figures responsible for the things talked about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AFrMpQxbmk">this documentary</a> are connected and linked to and associated with Freemasonry.</p>

<p>Think about that for a bit before doing anything further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Manly P. Hall and Albert Pike give very many explanations.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about symbolism. The reason you hear about the illuminati and stuff is because it allows for good connections. And thus these actual Saturn worshipers, A.k.a. Satanists, use these top connections to do as they please.</p>

<p>Also, look into the symbols. There is a lot of evidence pointing to Saturn worship in Freemasonry as well. Like the symbols originating with Saturn worship.</p>

<p>There are documentaries on YouTube about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The “illumined” worship Lucifer/Satan who they believe brought the “light” of knowledge of good and evil to mankind to “free” them from God.</p>

<p>Jefferson wrote his own Bible.</p>

<p>Masons require you to, more generically than believing in God, believe in a “supreme being”.  This is represented by “The Great Architect of the Universe”.  An architect takes existing materials and builds from them.  I don’t believe Masons believe in a creator God.  Satan/Lucifer cannot create like God can.  In the highest degrees of at least the Scottish Rite, based on Masonic writings, it is revealed that Lucifer is the object of their worship.</p>

<p>Masons are not allowed to speak about their religious beliefs in the lodge according to an interview with a Mason that I saw.</p>

<p>Bill Cooper, a true patriot and expert in Freemasonry, believed that the founding fathers were members of secret societies like Freemasonry.  He believed that America was set up by them to be the “Great Experiment” to test whether the “profane” could rule themselves.  Given what is happening today, it seems we are too ready to sacrifice our liberties for “protection” from our government.  Granted, the “illumined” have meddled with and been in our government from its inception.</p>

<p>I strongly urge you to not become a Mason.  At the very least, educate yourself on Freemasonry first:</p>

<p>My understanding is that it has been infiltrated, and it is not what it once was.  I am being generous here because it probably was always evil.  I say this because I researched their symbolism, and that says it all.  </p>

<p>I could go on, but you get the picture...  </p>

<p>Also, consider this.  The only reason an organization has secrets is because they have a hidden agenda.  If Freemasonry was benign, then they would not need to have any secrets...   </p>

<p>Look up the meaning of a pig-in-a-poke, because that is exactly what Freemasonry is.  They offer you a prize, and you agree to accept it before you know what the prize is.    </p>

<p>The Great Secret is that you agree to worship Lucifer before you realize that that is what you agreed to!   Tada!!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s one objective truth, no point in labeling the truth with names like Christianity or Satanism. IMO it&#39;s early for you to join a esoteric club you have to pay to be part of, read books on your own time and increase your knowledge like that, when you know you&#39;ll need a teacher you don&#39;t have to ask, just that you have to ask tells me you&#39;re not ready. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing &#39;very&#39; special to expect after lot of spiritual practice in the way you imagine it is, it&#39;s special to implement your thoughts/what you&#39;ve learned into action and to heal not just yourself but to bring good to everything around you. Think why Pagans love nature and animals so much, why Jesus said pray in your own home you don&#39;t need a church and the deadly sins, </p>

<p>Try not to think about unattainable/sensational goals or things you expect to gain from spirituality like heaven, hell, meeting entities or whatever. Religion&#39;s turned into cultic brainwashing techniques, just realize your thoughts shape your reality, your reality includes other beings. </p>

<p>To create a heaven we have to give back more to society/nature than what we take or at least not abuse it/to be able to handle one&#39;s karma responsibly, think why governments treat society like babies. It&#39;s about creating a better world, they don&#39;t want us to realize our own power, don&#39;t constantly seek for something amazing to happen outside yourself, understand things that are either so controlled or so vague are much more definite and malleable than you think, join a esoteric club or any social club if you need it for whatever reason/s just make sure you need it before going into it without undefined expectations and it&#39;s right for you, you need at least 3 people to create a functional group I&#39;d say no to Freemasonry but that&#39;s just me.   </p>

<p>We have founded many secret associations, which all work for our purpose, under our orders and our direction. One of the many triumphs of our Freemansonry is that those Gentiles who become members of our Lodges, shoud never suspect that we are using them to build their own jails, upon whose terraces we shall erect the throne of our unversal King of the Jews; and should never know that we are commanding them to forge the chains of their own servility to our future King of the World&quot;-- Opening speech made at the B&#39;nai B&#39;rith convention in Paris </p>

<p>No, we aren&#39;t Satanic, at all. I suggest you read up on the &#39;Taxil Hoax&#39; where most of this BS originates:</p>

<p>Drop by <a href="/r/freemasonry">/r/freemasonry</a> if you have any questions. If you prefer a book I recommend [Seriously, I am not trolling] &#39;Freemasons for Dummies&#39;, but Christopher Hodapp.</p>
