        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I watched a lot of these videos talking about the kalergi plan and how the ethnic groups are all part of meshes in the same environment would inevitably clash. Living in a multiracial nation like Australia I can’t help but ponder on about how exactly people actually cognitively receive those not of their ethnicity, beyond just verbal greetings, occasional meet ups and small daily exchanges like buying goods or participating in group work at the office/University. Could the different ethnicities be in fact highly balkanised and not actually mesh well together due their mutual detachment of each other’s heritage? </p>

<p>For example a group of Croatian Australians may find it easier to enter the circle of a English/Greek group due to having some correlation to each other’s western heritage. The same for a group of Cantonese into a circle of Vietnamese but it’d be much harder for the Cantonese to mesh into the established circles of croatians/English, perhaps smaller numbers potentially could but a larger mass would have less likelihood for ease of exchange. Eventually the bigger populations would need to be permananetly segregated in order to prevent large scales clashes from occurring, the corullna riots are a key example of such ethnic tensions reaching boiling point. </p>

<p>Would this mean a eventual break up would occur in a diverse nation like Australia or Canada? If things get ugly a civil war may occur but only if most of the population becomes politically incensed. Maybe a escalation like Syria could be avoided if people recognises the futilties of maintaining a diverse country, and peacefully resolve how the populations will disperse. Or could such countries just begin to more and more resemble the slum ridden cities in brazil with the different ethnicities all vouching for seperate regions in order to avoid having too many altercations with one another? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t post about this all the time, nobody on Facebook is gonna have a debate like this with me without throwing accusations of being a literal Nazi thrown at me. You could go look at this channel called ‘alternative hypothesis’ and see the kind of data he’s compiles about how the races behave differently in the same environment and evidence of how America was originally planned to be an ethnostate for Europeans. </p>

<p>It’s the same for Australia which is primarily of anglo Saxon foundation like Canada, most of the people have a clear British lineage and identifies with those values. Yes the class system is an issue which utterly eats up countries like Brazil, it also happens to be racially diverse with Europeans, natives, Africans, East Asians and mixed races. </p>

<p>If you ever being to Sydney you’d see what I’m talking about, huge ethnic ghettoes forming where people are generally rather distrustful of one another and crime rates are high. Australia is supposed to be fairly egalitarian and have rather small class gaps that doesn’t seriously alienate each other. But clearly different ethnicities have a lot of issues trying on mingle together as one people when their racial identity are clearly very different. Call me a racist but I’m rather pessimistic about the future and could see a huge ugly chain reaction spurning from a lot of the Anglo population who’d feel they are being replaced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>facebook is a terrible place to &quot;debate&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; races behave differently in the same environment&quot;
Shit is kinda propaganda. You&#39;re viewing from the present without acknowledging the past. The division of todays society goes over peoples heads.</p>

<p>Race is Darwinian propaganda</p>

<p>America was originally planned to be an ethnostate for Europeans</p>

<p>This is true and its the reason the natives were wiped out and not enslaved. actually all of the america&#39;s. </p>

<p>Australia which is primarily of anglo Saxon</p>

<p>Anglo saxon&#39;s are part of the nwo. They wiped destroy all non-conforming european culture</p>

<p>&quot;class system is an issue which utterly eats up countries like Brazil, it also happens to be racially diverse with Europeans, natives, Africans, East Asians and mixed races.&quot;</p>

<p>You should research more about these people and &quot;races&quot; These issues are manufactured. Also most spent a lot of time under european revisionism. A lot of those places and had their culture and past wiped off the face of the planet to be reinvented by europeans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I&#39;ve been there done that I stopped debating. </p>

<p>Right wings are literal tools of the nwo, same for the left but they&#39;re like the proxy children of the nwo. Well they both are but they both have their own jobs to do.</p>

<p>Race and nationality is garbage especially when the ones of gave it to you are the nwo. People fail to realize a vast majority of the race&#39;s and nationality are entirely dependent on colonization and the destruction of culture and generations to be reinvented by the nwo.</p>

<p>Honestly if you look at the way &quot;blacks&quot; culture was destroyed and reinvented you&#39;ll start to see how it changed the world. Especially when you realize more europeans are closer to being black than being white. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been called all sorts of names especially on facebook considering I don&#39;t use fake accounts. I&#39;m mixed. &quot;White&quot; people don&#39;t like the truth, &quot;black&quot; people don&#39;t like the truth. </p>

<p>But they&#39;re also very nazi like.</p>

<p>You need to realize they own the playing field, they change the playing field, they game the playing field. People fail to realize they&#39;re the pawns in the game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I can see a lot of right wing channels gain pretty good momentum stacking Trudeau for being a globalist attempting to force down leftist ideals onto the entire population, as well as pardoning Isis insurgents and giving muslims a lot of privileges. The whole kalergi plan of the western world being ‘systematically replaced’ is also starting to gain recognition on YouTube. There’s heavy fire laid down on the entire idea of a multiracial society even being possible without eventual decline, not many are really throwing any good counter arguments besides the general fluffy ideas of ‘don’t judge by race but character’. This very well can be a sign of the collapse of ‘we are all one’ and back to the old imperial days of nation vs nation and tribe vs tribe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I live here, in a city that&#39;s about 30% immigrants, and it&#39;s generally fine.  I manage a landscaping company, and at any given time I would say that 50+% of my workforce is immigrants.  They&#39;re no different than anybody else.  Somewhat different cultural values, but Canadians are generally pretty accepting as long as it doesn&#39;t cause problems.  Our immigration policies are pretty strict, and most if not all of the undesirables get filtered out.  We certainly don&#39;t have anything like the problems in Europe and Scandinavia caused by mass unregulated immigration.</p>

<p>For instance, a white woman can have a black baby, right? But a black woman cannot have a white baby, huh?

In most cities in Canada, a shitty infested one bedroom apartment is about $1000/month.  In Toronto and in most of BC it&#39;s much more.  These apartments should only be about $600 a month -- for students, seniors, pensioners, people on disability or social assistance, people working low wage jobs under $20 a hour, etc.  Immigration is absolutely skyrocketing rents for even crappy starter apartments.  Not to mention starter homes.  It&#39;s so hard to get on the property ladder to build equity without being in a couple, dual income.  This never used to be the case.  Our standard of living in Canada is plummeting due to our ill thought out immigration policies!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it will have some sort of effect moving forward. I am canadian and very accepting of any culture that comes here. However today we are having issues with people coming over here and trying to change our way of life thats not done in their culture. For example we can’t say Merry Christmas anymore as other cultures who came here don’t celebrate it and they complained about it so now we have to say Happy Holidays. It’s a stupid change I know but it is progressively getting worse and more and more stuff will be demanded to change to please them. If I moved to another country I would have 0 expectations for an entire nation to change just for my beliefs so I am not sure why they can choose to come here but refuse to conform and demand change. </p>

People could be forming mobs and provincial militias to round up and punish minorities for whatever ills they could be blamed for. I’m not even discussing culture but the racial lineage of people in such countries, the alt right argues people act as they are genetically programmed by their ethnicity and ‘race is culture’.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting subject. I’ve always thought about how the average white person in the United States is essentially a genetic mix when compared to the average white European. I feel like there is a British ‘look’, a German ‘look’, a Spanish ‘look’, etc... in terms of bone structure, skin tone, eye shape, etc.  But when it comes to white Americans, you can see a huge range in bone structure and facial features. In Minnesota and Wisconsin the average white person is almost completely Scandinavian genetically, while the average white person in Long Island has a good chance of being almost fully Italian. And yet they are both ‘white’ people.</p>

<p>I’m biracial, and I know that mixed mixed-race people in the US have almost double the rate of mental illness as monoracial people. What if this same phenomenon fractals out into White America, the mathematical bulk of America’s population? At the genetic level, they literally do not look like each other to the same degree that an Englishman or Frenchman would. This could be the driving force behind why America is a neurotic nation obsessed with competition- it’s a nation of genetic strangers with zero ancestral identity.</p>

<p>Just my theory.</p>

<p>true but the zero ancestral identity is part of the greater plan. It&#39;s literally one of the leg the nwo stands on because no one knows their lineage. Our ancestors are flipping in their graves </p>

If 5-10% of the population started fighting that is still 15-35 million people.  With innocents who would prefer to live in peace getting caught in the middle of it.  People would eventually have to take sides thinking it is the only way to survive.  Think of it like prison.  Many people go in not being racist...but end up joining racial gangs as a way to protect themselves.  That will all lead to retaliation from original non participants etc.</p>

<p>Race is Darwinian propaganda</p>

<p>America was originally planned to be an ethnostate for Europeans</p>

<p>Anglo saxon&#39;s are part of the nwo. They wiped destroy all non-conforming european culture</p>

<p>&quot;class system is an issue which utterly eats up countries like Brazil, it also happens to be racially diverse with Europeans, natives, Africans, East Asians and mixed races.&quot;</p>

<p>You should research more about these people and &quot;races&quot; These issues are manufactured. Also most spent a lot of time under european revisionism. A lot of those places and had their culture and past wiped off the face of the planet to be reinvented by europeans.</p>
