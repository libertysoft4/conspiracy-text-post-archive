This sub is now a write off to shills, mainly from the left, it&#39;s what originally turned me off this sub to begin with a while back when pizzagate gathered momentum. It was once nice conversing with like minded people. This will be my last contribution to this sub, ever.</p>

<p>I will not reply to any troll messages.</p>

<p>To the sincere people still on the front lines fighting the good fight: I applaud you. However I believe the majority here are now shills in an attempt to control the narrative. Which is now forever broken because this sub is too left field for most.</p>

<p>Bye chaps.</p>

<p>I will say this, there has been one group controlling things for a long time, they went into panic mode when trump won, and certain topics became public knowledge, and have been desperately scrambling to gain control again but the illusion has broken for too many.</p>

<p>You can weaponise these liberal useful idiots, but too many are aware to what is really occurring, at least to some degree that the official narrative is complete bullshit.</p>

<p>Truth will prevail.</p>

<p>Edit: this post started getting momentum into double digits then was immediately downvoted to zero with a couple of minutes. Sure.</p>

Lots of us saw what HRC did to Bernie, saw the Wikileaks dumps, saw the Pgate evidence, and we&#39;re right there with you.

<p>You need to browse the sub by /new, it&#39;s where the best convo can still be had, and ground zero in the fight against the shills. I&#39;ve personally encountered Libertarians, Anarchists, Socialists, Communists, Social Dems, and more.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not Tyranny of the mob...its DD at the local level, with local institutions voluntarily associating into larger Confederations and Federations, based on re-callable delegates and not Representatives. Total lack of government and rules, pure Libertarianism, still leads to &quot;tyranny&quot; if taken to its logical extreme. </p>

<p>Libertarian Socialism is based on the Municipal level, and Free associations with that level and moving up- no one is forcing you to associate with your local municipality. </p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not ignorant at all. I&#39;m trying to explain an Anarchist POV w/ a socially focused end game. There can be no dictatorship if there is <em>no central government</em>. </p>

<p>What I advocate for is natural...it calls for the justification of all Hierarchical institutions and elimination of those that can not defend their existence based on the legitimacy of the People and what the institutions represent.</p>

If you want to be a citizen you pay taxes for infrastructure like roads, protection from police/military, and on and on.

    <div class="md"><p>So cheese pizza means pedophilia. And there is a band that plays at the pizza place that made a Jered Fogel joke. And a pizza place near this pizza place has a symbol that looks like a different symbol. And John Podesta knew the Speaker of the House and Podesta received an email. And gays use handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>Is that a reasonable summary of the evidence?</p>

<p>Name one. Funny how no one called Hastert or King a pedophile before victims actually came forward and accused them, but when it comes to democrats you apparently don&#39;t even need a victim to accuse them of a pretty damn serious crime. </p>

<p>No, if there&#39;s no victims and no evidence then you can&#39;t ACCUSE A SPECIFIC PERSON of a crime. You understand that pizzagate is a conspiracy ACCUSING specific democrats of being pedophiles, right? You understand these democrats have never once been accused of molesting children, right? So how do you justify people being accused of molesting children when no children have every accused them of anything?</p>

AFAIK, no one has brought charges against anyone in a court of law in regards to pizza gate. A lot of people are convinced that podesta is a child molester/abuser. Personally I think there isn&#39;t enough evidence to prove he or alefantis are actually involved in child trafficking. I do think the emails are very strange and there is definitely some strange code words being used but that&#39;s as far as I&#39;m willing to say is true beyond a doubt.

<p>That&#39;s not even close to what I&#39;m saying here. This was a discussion about pizzagate specifically, and pizzagate is 100% based on accusing actual people of hurting children even though not a single child has accused these people of hurting them. My point is you can&#39;t accuse a specific person of being a pedophile if no victim has accused that person of molesting them.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not actually true. Cathy O&#39;Brien for one has accused Hillary Clinton, among others, of raping her as a child many years back, did so in a published book (where she claims to have been a subject of a child-focused MK-Ultra government program, described in great detail) and has never been sued or anything. Not many people consider her very credible, mind, as her accusations go so far beyond consensus reality, but the assertion that none of these people involved have ever been accused of anything like this before is false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair there is a difference between pizzagate and the Franklin cover up.  Pizzagate commonly refers to Alefantis, Podesta, and Comet. Nobody on this sub is denying elite pedophelia in general. Nobody is denying pedogate. Pizzagate is a problematic term because of its specificity. If you start using the term pedogate you will get no argument from people here (I’m generalizing I know). 
You may disagree with my definition of Pizzagate, and that’s fine and fair, but hopefully you can see how it can be confusing to others who read posts with that term because of the history of the phrase. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in <em>both</em> Pedogate and Pizzagate. They are different but connected. Pgate is a specific incident which arose from the Wikileaks emails, Pedogate is the large issue itself. Franklin, Dutroux, Hastert, etc; just add to the evidence that this shit <em>does</em> happen, and it makes Pgate all that more believable. Pgate is definitely the &quot;smaller&quot; of the issues, but Pgate spiraled into Pedogate in its modern iteration. I think they are all connected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand you believe in both, that’s fine, but your defense of Pizzagate in the original post I replied is to bring up Franklin etc. I can totally believe that Pizzagate is partisan and false and still believe Franklin, Hastert, etc. are very real. You saying ‘well what about Franklin’ does nothing to prove Pizzagate, so what do you want them to say? Sure the respectable thing to do would be to say ‘I agree elite pedophelia exists in this country and government, and you have given me a good example I too believe in. However I still believe Pizzagate is false’, but I can see why they may just downvote you for changing the subject (tangentially) and move on (not good rediquette on their part tho). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are completely misunderstanding what I said, this sub was politicized, i.e. turned into a political battleground and haven for TD to spam anti-DNC, Hillary Clinton, Podesta, etc. stuff until there was quite literally nothing else on the front page. I’m assuming I don’t need to remind you of the times when 23/25 of the front page posts would be abt Hillary? Politically motivated brigading isn’t the point of a conspiracy sub, and I can only assume that you have some misguided notion that the left is taking over the sub now (despite the fact that the sub is still predominately conservative) bc the sub isn’t as disgustingly biased as it was only a short while ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm, pretty close to what he labelled you as.  Not a fan of labels but you pretty much described it for him.    </p>

<p>If you can get a good takeaway from him calling you a TD monkey, not saying I agree, its that the complaints about the sub being ruined, I think fairly should be directed towards the massive Hillary posts over the last year.  She&#39;s out of office and the Clinton foundation is at best in deep hibernation, if not competley gone. Yet we saw massive, massive volume of posts of stuff related to her while completely ignoring Donald&#39;s in your face self serving actually documented conspiracies being shown in real time.    </p>

<p>He conspired to do stuff, did that stuff and then told us he did it.  Meanwhile most of this sub, for a better part of a year, seemed to have laser focus for the person that lost the election and most of her political power and things that have already been discussed ad nauseum.        </p>

<p>Beeehngaaaauuuziii!      </p>

<p>Donald fired head of FBI        </p>

<p>BengauzAnianin....it was obamas fault but now we are sure it&#39;s Hillary 100 percent to blame....and somehow this is a conspiracy post.        </p>

<p>Hillary screwed over Sanders.......    </p>

<p>Yeah she did   </p>

<p>Wait, we agree on this?   </p>

<p>Yeah, let&#39;s keep posting about it but ignore Donald Trump, the guy actually in office and all.the borderline illegal, if not flat out illegal stuff he has done</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of his business dealings beforehand, forcing people to sue to be paid.  If he didn&#39;t have the lawyers he did, I&#39;d argue he would have been charged with fraud several times.  Ask how the people of scotland feel about his tactics in getting what he wants.  </p>

<p>The women claiming to be assaulted by him.  Don&#39;t believe them if you want but they are no more politically or financially motivated then all the people talking about pizzagate or Benghazi with just as much &quot;evidence&quot; and facts people can &quot;do their research on&quot;.      </p>

<p>Lie after lie after lie.  Contradicts himself in his own sentences often.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that based on what he says publically, he has likely said treasonous statements many times behind closed doors.  I&#39;d argue knowingly lying to the American public should be treason or fraud.  A crime against democracy.  Sounds dramatic sure but no more dramatic then your original post.    </p>

<p>My biggest point is that left leaning shills or not, no way you can agree that they are the dominant shill side.  Might be brigading but the Hillary posts about nonsense dominated for a year.  There was by far a right bias and when people started to notice, it started to die down.     People were politically motivated, not conspiracy motivated to post Hillary stuff.  A lot were not even conspiracies, just her possibly being involved in something shitty.    </p>

<p>I think she is shit but this we all would have been better served to have a sub for anything with keywords trump or hillary auto posted to another new subreddit.  r/shillconspiracy or something like that for all your political propaganda jobs</p>

<p>Really I think it&#39;s multiple people trying to censor anybody possible hitting the nail.on the head with a legitimate conspiracy or questioning anyone in power.  </p>

<p>Left or right, whoever is in power or fighting for it are currently trying to silence any real discourse because then they have to actually defend their ideas rather then just label people as commies or white supremisists or whatever.  They don&#39;t want their ideas challenged.  They want you to agree or be fully demonized by labelling so your opinion is silenced socially </p>

I understand that people have a difference of opinion and I am not advocating to ban people who don&#39;t share certain viewpoints. All I&#39;m saying is that it&#39;s a little odd that people would come to this sub and force their own definition of what constitutes an acceptable conspiracy theory. If we talk about theories that don&#39;t jive with all the skeptics, it makes more sense for the skeptics to debate us. Instead, they just attack you as uneducated and then refuse to address any points you&#39;ve made while asserting that you&#39;re the one making baseless claims without evidence. They are definitely playing with language in order to seem like they espouse an undeniable position, but the whole point of being here is to discuss possible deception, so for them to come here and assert that there is no deception is very telling. It&#39;s one thing to say &quot;yeah these governmental institutions are lying to us&quot; and it&#39;s another thing to say &quot;they are lying to us because they are hiding a flat earth.&quot; Most of these skeptics won&#39;t even admit to premise one and will vehemently attack you for suggesting the second premise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do have choice, representative government and voting. If you want to be a citizen you pay taxes for infrastructure like roads, protection from police/military, and on and on. And yes the disenfranchised pay less and in some cases get help, but that&#39;s because we choose to help because not to do so is immoral. </p>

<p>So if that means the most entitled rich folk and corporations pay more into the system then so be it - it is the cost of a stable growing economy which is what enables their wealth.</p>

<p>Maybe its different those bastions of freedom like Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that makes no sense. right wingers are not separate from the government. they are in and make up government same with left wingers. both are the same and have been for a long time. both push government status quo. you seem very ignorant of us system. why two parties? why two paradigms? why two teams? you are being tricked. why does it take outsiders to get us people to understand this!?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand you believe in both, that’s fine, but your defense of Pizzagate in the original post I replied is to bring up Franklin etc. I can totally believe that Pizzagate is partisan and false and still believe Franklin, Hastert, etc. are very real. You saying ‘well what about Franklin’ does nothing to prove Pizzagate, so what do you want them to say? Sure the respectable thing to do would be to say ‘I agree elite pedophelia exists in this country and government, and you have given me a good example I too believe in. However I still believe Pizzagate is false’, but I can see why they may just downvote you for changing the subject (tangentially) and move on (not good rediquette on their part tho). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I&#39;m not anyone of anything, for the hundredth time. Pizza gate to me is simply an investigation. AFAIK, no one has brought charges against anyone in a court of law in regards to pizza gate. A lot of people are convinced that podesta is a child molester/abuser. Personally I think there isn&#39;t enough evidence to prove he or alefantis are actually involved in child trafficking. I do think the emails are very strange and there is definitely some strange code words being used but that&#39;s as far as I&#39;m willing to say is true beyond a doubt. Again, I&#39;m just arguing against you&#39;re shitty logic that a crime only exists if you have heard if a victim has come forward to accuse someone </p>

<p>You understand these democrats have never once been accused of molesting children, right? So how do you justify people being accused of molesting children when no children have every accused them of anything?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not actually true. Cathy O&#39;Brien for one has accused Hillary Clinton, among others, of raping her as a child many years back, did so in a published book (where she claims to have been a subject of a child-focused MK-Ultra government program, described in great detail) and has never been sued or anything. Not many people consider her very credible, mind, as her accusations go so far beyond consensus reality, but the assertion that none of these people involved have ever been accused of anything like this before is false.</p>
