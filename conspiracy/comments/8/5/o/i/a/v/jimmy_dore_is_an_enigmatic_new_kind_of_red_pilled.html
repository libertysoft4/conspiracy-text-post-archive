        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Jimmy Dore has a big and growing following, and he is a red pilled phenomenon unlike any I have seen before.</p>

<p>He is a hard core liberal--and yet--he has figured out that Obama, Hillary, the MSM, and the Democratic Party are even more evil than Trump and the Republican Party.</p>

<p>He is disgusted by the fake Russiagate narrative. He is also hardcore anti-war and anti-intelligence community.</p>

<p>To be clear, he still believes all the other things Democrats are supposed to believe; whereas, I do not, but I am still praising him because he is a new kind of phenomenon. He has made a big move towards reality. Every liberal I know would die before they would admit such things.</p>

<p>If he is controlled opposition, then I do not yet see what the angle is. (Although ... he did go backwards on one issue--he says that he used to support an armed citizenry, and now he doesn&#39;t.)</p>

<p>Every day you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYSOmD5LyYs">videos like this</a> from him.</p>

<p>He says he was first awakened nearly two years ago by a book by a liberal called &quot;Listen Liberals&quot;, but I only learned about him last month because YouTube never recommend him before that.</p>

<p>A lot of us &quot;hardcore Liberals&quot; have been following Dore since the Primaries. He was calling out HRC&#39;s bullshit back then. This is something people need to recognize- Left and Right are allies in this. HRC, Obama, and the Deep State are Corporatist Neocon/Neolibs...they are NOT the Left.</p>

<p>The real Left is busy trying to storm the Party from the Grassroots. We&#39;ve taken 8 State Parties from the Corporate Dems so far, and are gunning for more.</p>

<p>This is done by the weakness of the Dem Party itself. The smallest organizational unit of the Party is the precinct. Any registered Dem can show up and vote for their Precinct Chair. Precinct Chairs vote for Country Chairs, who vote for State Chairs, who vote for National Chairs. This is how we take the Party back from the cold, dead hands of the Corporatists.</p>

<p>Left and Right are both engaged in a death struggle, together, for the Republic and against the Neocon/Neolib malignancy that has infested the halls of DC for at least 40 years, with the true rot going far deeper. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was and he wasn&#39;t. FDR was a Capitalist, and his New Deal was set out to save Capitalism from itself. If FDR hadn&#39;t done what he did, there might have been a Socialist revolution in the US back in the 30&#39;s. Social Security created a retirement age and pension, stronger Unions allowed the post war boom to be equitably distributed among the workers and the bosses, and infrastructure projects like the TVA modernized the country. </p>

<p>FDR didn&#39;t want to destroy Capitalism, and he was an Elite who sought a compromise between the People and the rest of his Class. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FDR made Unions stronger. In 1956, 53% of all American workers were union members. Wages rose steadily with profits, and the incredible wealth of the post-war boom was spread equitably- bosses still made more, but their workers got their fair cut of it.</p>

<p>Social Security was radical- never before had the concept of a &quot;retirement age&quot; been culturally enshrined. Europe quickly followed suit. SS dropped Elderly poverty from 70%+ to less than 30%, though after years of repealing legislation and rising inflation, this number is creeping up again towards 50%. </p>

<p>The infrastructure projects of the 30&#39;s <em>did</em> modernize the country. The New Deal plumbed and wired the countryside, so that these were standard commodities in most US households by the mid 40&#39;s. The TVA was just an example of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>out of curiosity, was the new deal funded by borrowing money on the principle of profitable returns from the investment to the fed, or through taxation? either way, it seems a prudent investment that did create returns. just wondering where the revenue for the projects originated from (and the status of that debt if it was not locally organic/ was ww2 part of repaying this debt?) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of the debt was mere deficit spending- which had never been tried on such a scale before. Back in the 30&#39;s it was a radical idea (and dangerous) to decide to spend money on a national scale in order to make it. The New Deal itself wouldn&#39;t have ended the Depression, it just established the conditions for the equitably economy of the post-war era. WW2 and its jump starting of production and full employment are what fully pulled us out, then the New Deal helped create the &quot;rules&quot; for the new economy, imo. </p>

<p>The revenue was collected through taxes but it was also printed, this is why FDR suspended the Gold Standard from about &#39;34-&#39;45, so that deficit spending could be allowed. The boom from the War and its after-effects allowed this debt to be easily payed for- something we would have to figure out if we were to do it again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, War isn&#39;t usually good. But WW2 was an aberration, which makes people think all wars are good for the economy. WW2 was good for the US because it destroyed Europe and Asia, which meant that in &#39;45 the US produced 52% of <em>all</em> global goods- it was great for the US because it let us rebuild Europe and Japan and have them buy our shit.

<p>Because the modern Dem Party doesn&#39;t stand for the little guy...and many of us on the Left, like myself, believe in gun ownership and own weapons. How else can I call for National Healthcare and College/Trade education if I don&#39;t have the power to ensure the government does it?</p>

<p>That&#39;s both parties my friend. The Republicans just want you to vote every 4 years and forget about it- leave it to them to take care of business, ignore their corruption, and let them &quot;run government&quot; so you don&#39;t have to. The Republic was designed to be run by a civically active citizenry.</p>

<p>Neither Party represents the People of today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, the black community has been neutralized by government dependency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which has its real roots in the 90&#39;s, with Clintons <em>bipartisan</em> &quot;Welfare Reform&quot;, which added Welfare cliffs and made it virtually impossible to get out of the system once in it- because instead of tapering benefits they immediately stop them if you make 1$ over the line, which is insane bullshit. Both Parties supported this. </p>

<p>I think there is plenty of places doing it but I cant name you any. But I guess Mondragon Corporation would be an example, but not a great one(I think, don&#39;t really know enough about it).</p>

<p>Government could make it easier without dismantling anything also, give good tax incentives. Like instead of filing your tax as a corporation you do it as a Co-op, with accompanying tax-benefits. It&#39;s still completely in line of free market and capitalist ideals but since it removes a power from corporations government would never do a thing like that. Unless it&#39;s a Ron Paul/Bernie Sanders type populist in government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess, I don&#39;t know tax laws though so take nothing I say as truth. I&#39;m not in theory against taxation either, as it&#39;s an effective tool to pool resources for necessary things, done right you can make it a solid foundation for society. But since the point is you&#39;re not withdrawing a profit but simply pay wages for workers who own it collectively I don&#39;t see why not really, but would you trust the IRS to not suddenly change routine to mess with something that threatens corporate hegemony? </p>

<p>If I were to do it I&#39;d do it while paying taxes and being a really good sport about it, don&#39;t give them fodder for something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>alright, i was really trying not to feed the troll... but go look into it. look into the rift between JD and TYT. they are NOT on the same page. JD has his own youtube channel and hes pretty fucking clear about what he thinks and how he differs from cenk. JD is a legit progressive and he doesnt kowtow to anyone, let alone cenk. he is not controlled opposition like you say. and there is a huge problem with people like you spreading straight up FALSE bullshit. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This whole &#39;rift&#39; narrative is horseshit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s basically professional wrestling. </p>

<p>Cenk is still his boss. <a href="https://tytnetwork.com/2018/03/14/aggressive-progressives-mar-14-2018-2/">https://tytnetwork.com/2018/03/14/aggressive-progressives-mar-14-2018-2/</a></p>

<p>Literally the textbook definition of &#39;controlled&#39; &#39;opposition&#39;</p>

<p>And as stated before, tyt had adamantly defended and received funding from George soros. </p>

<p>Here he is saying police are worse than isis.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ah3d73l9RFE">https://youtu.be/ah3d73l9RFE</a></p>

<p>Certainly fits into the soros / antifa / blm / civil unrest narrative. </p>

<p>And here he is white washing and deflecting with tyt in regards to mass gang rapes in Germany by Muslim refugees.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that soros is a big fan of the refugee crisis in Europe and open borders.</p>

<p>“His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle, our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and <strong>national borders as the obstacle.</strong>”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Have look in the mirror.</p>

<p>FYI trying to dismiss someone as a troll is an ad hominem and intellectually lazy. It actually weakens your argument not strengthen it.</p>

<p>But honestly, what can I expect from someone who is barely 20.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been following Dore for years. He represents the rise of left-leaning libertarians. I hate labels, but that&#39;s really the only way to explain it. There&#39;s a movement of left and right leaning libertarians and freethinkers who agree fundamentally on the wisdom of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These two factions may disagree on some details, but they are on the same page overall regarding who the real enemy is: the amoral, agnostic, and apolitical plutocrats, who only really care about wealth, power, and control.</p>

<p>Now, if only these two factions could get together and form a real coalition, the elites of both political parties would be in serious trouble. I think this is why they&#39;re focusing so much on sowing division. United we&#39;re unstoppable.</p>

<p>The point is that there are a lot of people, both on the left and the right who, if they would get together and agree on some basic fundamentals, could form a very powerful coalition to dismantle the current establishment - from both parties.</p>

<p>Um ... I&#39;ve been anti-establishment for 30 years. :-)</p>

<p>Although ... 15 years ago I did think that government was all bad (still do) and that we had a free market and that all business was thus good; whereas, 7 years ago I realized that we have a cronyist system instead of economic freedom ,and that to rise to the top in a  cronyist system is a disgrace.</p>

<p>Seriously, if you think Jimmy Dore is special, it&#39;s because your worldview of lefties has been crafted by the corporate media. I love his videos, he&#39;s really funny and informative, but politically, he&#39;s not really special. The policies he&#39;s in favor of ALL have majority support, whether he be talking about ending cannabis prohibition, ending illegal wars abroad, the need for a third party in US politics, etc. I&#39;d actually say that independent lefties like him are probably the largest segment of the population. Look at how polls show that Bernie Sanders is by far the most popular politician in the country, how do you think that happens? Because independent lefties who hate Democratic Party corruption fucking LOVE Bernie Sanders. </p>

<p>If anyone here likes Jimmy Dore, I&#39;d also recommend Redacted Tonight with Lee Camp. Jimmy does short videos of unscripted material covering current events, and it&#39;s great, but Redacted Tonight is a full-on production in the style of a cable news show, covering news stories that the corporate media ignores, all with a biting comedic style. It&#39;s like if The Daily Show was good at covering news and was actually funny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think often on this. Why would Russia try to appeal to the far left? Their own politics is way off the spectrum in comparison. My thoughts on this question is this. If America started working on our infrastructure and focused on domestic issues, it would allow Russia more freedom to continue on their international ventures with less interference from our government. I like Camp and his political views. I am also far more concerned about our domestic problems than I am with Russia.</p>

<p>Sadly, no. I have been discussing these issues with thousands of lefties online and thousands more in person overt he last 30 years primarily in DC and Seattle, and I eat lunch with them every chance I get--like 1000 times now--and I have never met <strong><em>one</em></strong> who is like Jimmy Dore.

<p>All the other Young Turks wanted Bernie people to fall in with Clinton.</p>

<p>I respect that he stood his ground. The guys a comedian but he covers issues a million times more thoroughly than mainstream shit &#39;news&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he, like the majority of actual Americans, is a REALIST. He gets that the world is usually different shades of gray, instead of the stark black or white the MSM tries to make us choose between. We need loud voices that will call out &#39;BULLSHIT&#39; irregardless of whose spewing it. He gets that Democrats vs Republicans shouldn&#39;t be treated like some sporting rivalry like the Red Sox vs Yankees because its not. With sports whoever wins, you end up with millionaires holding a trophy/ring. Politics sets the table that the world is forced to eat from for the foreseeable future. If anything politics is really just Pro Wrestling in $10,000 suits. When the cameras start rolling the good guys and the bad guys play their respective parts and tough talk,but when they go backstage they&#39;re cozy, hanging out, old pals. They&#39;re both working for the same promoter, just trying to get you to buy the PPV. 
TL;DR.- Politics = Pro Wrestling

    <div class="md"><p>How in the fuck is saying the Rothchilds control the climate the same as saying fuck all jews? Jesus Christ. I&#39;m sorry but some Jews are so sensitive. Its not like when someone attacks a caucasian person on TV or in the news I get offended just because I&#39;m white. What does their heritage have to do with controlling the weather? Who cares if the statement is crazy or wrong, its not anti-semitic.</p>

<p>You responded to the wrong post and maybe the wrong sub. Neither the post nor the comments mention &quot;Rothchilds&quot; or&quot;jews&quot;.</p>
