    <div class="md"><p>This is partially true, but I think there is definitely a spectrum of close-mindedness to open-mindedness where people are less controlled by their own pre-established world views.  I also think there is some truth to the various quotes that say something like &quot;The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don&#39;t know&quot;, where people who are aware of how much they don&#39;t know are less likely to think that their way of thinking is the truth.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say that smart people are less hostile, because there are clearly very smart people who are also hostile and overly sure of themselves, but I think it&#39;s a good barometer on whether you should avoid talking with people.  People who get defensive of their worldview are not going to be open to your alternative worldview.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been in this predicament many times. It has become a don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t discuss topic. Idk why. I&#39;d like to think all the Americans who died that day would WANT people to find the truth and find out what really happened. Jesse Ventura did a segment on Fox where he finished another book of his and was promoting it.  The book was regarding 911. One of Fox&#39;s Co-host stormed out of the segement when Jesse started asking questions regarding it. Why? Why couldn&#39;t he ask any questions? Why did the co-host storm out? It&#39;s unusual. It&#39;s odd. And most of all...suspicious!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Hermetica touches on this subject well. In humans, understanding can be quite painful, especially when it requires one to completely unbelieve what they thought was truth. This also requires admitting your own wrongness, which does not go well with somebody who has yet to come to control their ego.</p>

<p>You are literally inflicting pain on somebody when you start trying to make them unbelieve and understand - some people can take it and others can&#39;t, but most will put up their natural ego defenses at least to some degree.</p>

<p>Because of this, philosophers must come to be able to discuss things while absorbing the anger coming from the other party. It is a skill I&#39;ve yet to master, but it is essential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zizek&#39;s essay &quot;What Does the Joker Want?&quot; is completely about the same phenomenon you&#39;re describing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lacan.com/essays/?page_id=347">http://www.lacan.com/essays/?page_id=347</a></p>

<p>&quot;This necessity of a lie to sustain public morale is the film’s finale message: only a lie can redeem us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who, then, is Joker who wants to disclose the truth beneath the Mask, convinced that this disclosure will destroy the social order? He is not a man without mask, but, on the contrary, a man fully identified with his mask, a man who IS his mask.&quot;
-- Zizek</p>

<p>Every year I grow more and more furious about The Lie. But as individuals, what can any of us do about it? Not a damn thing.</p>

<p>Most people stop right there, saying there&#39;s no point in getting angry about world-sized forces nobody can control nor comprehend, and giving up.</p>

<p>ButI never give up, especially when I know I&#39;m right about something.</p>

<p>Instead of despair, I remind myself of Zizek&#39;s essay and ask myself: How can I be a better Joker?</p>

<p>&quot;Beware the fury of a patient man.&quot;

<p>Most of us will know the feeling. I&#39;ve found solace in the glimmers of Truth that can be seen shining through the cracks in the pavement. </p>

<p>We&#39;re not entirely on the wrong path. We&#39;ve been making great strides in the West in reducing systemic poverty, facilitating the development of the individual and in fostering potential, though much of this has been subverted, corrupted and even vilified in more recent years.</p>

<p>Still, I take solace in the fact that most people, no matter their race or political ideologies actually want the same things, by and large, if you boil it down to the basics. A stable environment, room to prosper for oneself and one&#39;s children, a reasonable degree of enjoyment and pleasure, a challenging task to fulfill in one&#39;s life, a reasonable degree of responsibility. You&#39;ll be hard pressed to find people who don&#39;t want these things, though you&#39;ll certainly find plenty who have given up on trying to acquire them because it&#39;s being made bloody difficult these days.</p>

<p>So while I empathize with the desire to burn it all down like the Joker, I think there&#39;s actually much to preserve. The only thing that nees to die, in my estimation, is our attachment to old ideas that do not work. Equity was proven not to work in every nation that tried to enforce it. Fascism was proven not to work in every sensible measure there is. Democracy was promising but quickly corrupted by the discovery and subsequent weaponization of mass psychology.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an easy debate to find out where the problem&#39;s lie, of course, because, for instance, it seems that industry is obviously problematic. Though is it really industry that is the problem or is it the reckless implementation of an otherwise good idea? The same can be said about capitalism or social democracies. There isn&#39;t a good idea out there that cannot be corrupted, but there are many good ideas nonetheless.</p>

<p>How to reduce or eliminate the coruption of well-inentioned ideas, that seems to be the million dollar question...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term ‘conspiracy theory’ was hijacked by Bush, his cronies and the MSM as a way of making it seem like we’re a bunch of loons.

    <div class="md"><p>Disregard for a second Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The FBI&#39;s integrity is questionable lately and I don&#39;t understand the tendency of people on Reddit in general to trust the CIA/NSA nowadays. 5 years ago we all were up in arms over its rampant spying and abuse of the American people&#39;s rights. They blatantly lied to our elected officials about their activities multiple times, and the one guy who tried to blow the whistle on them was demonized by them but hailed as a patriot on here. Yet, when those intelligence agencies start throwing out things people wanted to hear - that their preferred candidate lost because of Russian hacking - they are trustworthy now. Does it not seem like agencies so corrupted to the core would present misinformation to you in regards to areas beyond the ones we already know about, like the spying on every citizen? </p>

<p>Their assessments that Russian state actors gained access to the DNC is dubious at best. First, we know that not only do the CIA have the tools to fake cyberattacks to appear as different actors but they&#39;ve never even presented that information. Second, no government agency ever analyzed any data from or the systems themselves, as even the FBI has stated they didn&#39;t and instead relied on a 3rd party contractor (CrowdStrike).</p>

<p>You ask why they wouldn&#39;t release it. They have a long reputation of not leaking their sources. If they do start naming sources then it could deter future potential leakers. There&#39;s no concrete proof that he was the source but our intelligence agencies have likewise not released proof that Russia or anyone else was the source. We&#39;re very much in the dark as far as actual proof being presented to the public either way.</p>

<p>The rest of the report, I don&#39;t care to get into as that&#39;s beyond this thread and I don&#39;t think we should hijack it to be about the issue of overall Russian involvement. </p>

<p>Because I value the truth and I don&#39;t believe any of those agencies have told the truth to the American people in a very long time. In fact, that was the conventional wisdom on this very website since its inception until around the time of the primaries when this Russia bullshit started.</p>

<p>I addressed multiple reasons throughout my posts on why they are of dubious credibility, only one of which was the published text messages. To act like my conclusions hinged primarily on the exchange of text messages between two agents not only deliberately misrepresents the contents of my posts but the weight of what was contained in those texts.</p>

<p>The left has absolutely despised all the CIA and NSA for at least a decade now and were never quiet about how evil and dishonest they are. Then, when suddenly they&#39;re saying things that the left wants to hear, they&#39;re all patriots and boy scouts.

<p>He is clearly incompetent. Openly lying to Justin Trudeau in public? Not reading security briefings? Tweeting contradictory policy statements? He&#39;s a bad diplomat and ignorant of policy.

<p>Against Trump. I firmly believe they would&#39;ve backed some other Republican or stood mute if it weren&#39;t Trump. Remember, there were FISA warrants against Trump for foreign contact with Russian agents during the campaign. Even Steve Bannon thought that was a bad idea.</p>

<p>ISIS is pretty much dead in Syria and we avoided WW3 so far. While other candidates seemed to want to have a dick swinging contest with Russia in Syria he managed the situation without making us look weak or getting involved against Russia. </p>

<p>I distrust Obama and his agencies for a number of reasons. Hasting&#39;s death, disposing of Gadaffi for no good reason and starting the refugee &quot;crisis&quot; which is bullshit because even according to Pew 42% of refugees are 18 to 34 males, weaponizing the IRS, drastically increasing the domestic spying on every American citizen and subsequently lying about it, Comey not indicting Hillary when anyone who has handled secret information knows exactly how fucked up that was. The FBI themselves have been aware of multiple mass shooters and terrorists and failed to stop them, including the Boston Bomber, Omar Mateen, Nicolas Cruz and many others. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s really my entire point. For years the same people taking everything they say at face value because they also hate Trump hated these same agencies and same people for lying to us repeatedly, especially the spying aspect. But you seem to think these same dirty bastards would be above making shit up about the extent of the Russian involvement to cover their own asses. I think people are letting their own dislike of Trump allow these people to pretend to be acting in the people&#39;s best interests while really they are just trying to save themselves. They certainly haven&#39;t been acting on behalf of the American people in the past so I don&#39;t see it likely they are suddenly concerned with that now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problem people have is sometimes us conspiracy theorists mix known facts with unknown items. For example, we know he worked for the DNC, was murdered, nothing was taken, and the officials are saying it’s a botched robbery. We don’t know for certain (although in my opinion it seems highly likely) that he had proof regarding Hillary and a scandal. It’s seems highly likely he leaked info to Wikileaks.
There are lots of questions in this case and it is annoying when you ask questions, people starting saying it’s a conspiracy theory. Why kill someone and not take anything when there’s no witnesses to make it urgent to run off? Where is his laptop? Supposedly he was alive when the cops and ambulance were there so why won’t the police release the bodycam videos? And I seem to remember hearing shortly after it happened that a store nearby had video cameras so what happened with that?</p>

<p>conspiracy theory (plural conspiracy theories)</p>

<p>A hypothesis alleging that the members of a coordinated group are, and/or were, secretly working together to commit illegal or wrongful actions including attempting to hide the existence of the group and its activities. In notable cases the hypothesis contradicts the mainstream explanation for historical or current events.&quot; If you believe anything surrounding that, then you are technically a conspiracy theorist</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s nothing wrong with being a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; there is something wrong with the bias that people have of the term, and the fact that people don&#39;t even know what the word conspiracy means anymore. and yeah to adress your post otherwise, it does suck, alot. the truth is, it&#39;s very easy to brainwash millions and millions of people. if you look at everything right now, or throughout history, it&#39;s pretty clear. it&#39;s just a fact of life. but there is also hope, people like you and me, people who see through the tv, through the fake glass on the world, we have power. thruth tellers are people of passion, liars are not. they can&#39;t bring us down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you have &#39;proof&#39; or what other people think of your &#39;proof&#39;.</p>

<p>What matters is that (1) your theory is disprovable, (2) that you know what evidence would disprove it,  and (3) you would accept it as disproven if presented with that evidence.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have 1, 2 &amp; 3 you would be arguing in bad faith and would be a conspiracy theorest.</p>

There are chapters on conspiracy in each which are keystone to the entirety of Machiavelli&#39;s work. Everybody who does not have their head up their ass is a conspiracy theorist, although some of them advertise a false front of not being one.</p>

Sometimes a real evidence based finding will appear here and actually be voted up, only to be washed away by one hundred unsourced claims on a different topic. For example the Russian spy post will last about a day before it retreats into the void. </p>
