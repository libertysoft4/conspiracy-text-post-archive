Hancock believes humans existed on earth before 12 000 years ago while Sitchin believes the Sumerians (first humans) were created by Annunaki (from Nibiru or planet X). I am confused and need help, you is right?. Thank you in advance for replies.</p>

<p>Forgot to include that Zacharia Sitchin always says that humans did not exist before 6000 years ago.</p>

<p>No one has the entire puzzle solved or figured out.  Everyone has bits and pieces.  Graham Hancock has certain cool, relevant pieces.  Zacharia Sitchin has other cool, relevant pieces.</p>

<p>One doesn&#39;t cancel the other out.  Existence is a <em>lot</em> more variegated than pretty much anyone can theorize about, and one would be very ill-advised to focus too much on any <em>one</em> figure and what they said exclusive to others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story I got is that humans were here, and then genetically modified by the Annunaki.  This is consistent with the correct translation of Genesis from Hebrew.  The Annunaki did not create man in the sense that man did not exist before.  Instead, the Annunaki took man and raised him up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say they&#39;re limited hangouts in the least, as they don&#39;t appear to be in the employ of any type of nefarious PTB.  They both seem(ed) to be honest researchers.  No one&#39;s perfect, however, so of course neither one has all the pieces of the puzzle figured out.  They&#39;re both, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/858cf5/is_graham_hancock_right_or_zacharia_sitchin/dvvi4ew/">as I said earlier</a>, just two valid pieces to an extremely complex puzzle made of a LOOOOT more pieces still and that isn&#39;t solved by the proclamations of any one individual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://sitchiniswrong.com/">http://sitchiniswrong.com/</a></p>

<p>This site was made by an actual scholar, Dr. Michael Heiser (<a href="http://drmsh.com/">http://drmsh.com/</a>) and in addition to &quot;debunking&quot; some of Sitchin&#39;s claims, he actually places them in proper historical and linguistic contexts.</p>

<p>He has a lot of lectures on Youtube, and I would highly recommend them. </p>

<p>Personally, I really enjoy the alien/alternate history side of conspiracy, and Dr. Heiser&#39;s work is fantastic. That said, even in the proper historical context, some of the beliefs and writings of ancient people are crazy and far out enough without us having to interject the wrong interpretations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did my senior paper on sitchin and the 13th planet. That was back in 03. I&#39;ve done alot of research since then, and I&#39;m still not sure I have the whole thing down. The sumerian stone tablets. This is what I focused on. Both Hancock and sitchin have done a lot of work on this but they are not the only ones... there are several places that have the translations online for the sumerian tablets. </p>

<p>Now the tablets speak of the anunki and the destruction that happend on their planet. It also talks about their life span and many other valuable clues. The tablets are pretty much a time line of events recorded like a journal. That journal speaks of the great creator or god who created everything. Singular god or creator, which is a major point that is over looked.</p>

<p>Key points are the weapons used &quot;energy weapons&quot; crystals used for power as well as computers. Space flight, the names of planets and key descriptions of those planets. Now the one thing that I&#39;m not clear on, and call into question, is the asteroid belt. In the tablets it says that this was the one major hurtle that kept the anunki from reaching earth... </p>

<p>Now unless I&#39;m mistaken, the astroid belt shouldn&#39;t be an issue in any way to a space ship. I should also point out, that I have no clue how water could be used as a means to break through the asteroid belt. That&#39;s the parts I  call into question first. </p>

<p>There are parts of the tablets that seem to be possible and others that I&#39;m not sure of. If you look at the bible and the tablets and crazy things seem to line up... </p>

<p>If I was to put it all together it would appear to me that God created man in the garden of eden. The anunki didn&#39;t make man, rather they took the missing link &quot;human&quot; and genetically enhanced it. I believe this is what scientists have been searching for, the link between man and neanderthal. I think  Adam and eve got kicked out of eden, then having sons, found wives who were the enhanced humans of the anunki. This makes the most logical sense to me. </p>
