<p>Oh I know, it gets harder to find this information every day. I&#39;m not sure what a great source would be, but the Haavara Agreement is too well-known for them to hide it so you would probably have some luck if you google it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I highly recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4JbWSwUWew">The Greatest Story Never Told</a> and/or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4W1ph9j_7c">Europa: the Last Battle</a>.</p>

<p>Yea, that&#39;s literally what I said.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t &quot;pay off&quot; anyone. They allowed German Jews to retain most or all of the value of their property by purchasing German goods for the Yishuv, which would redeem them in
Palestine local currency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It never came to fruition</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Straight up false, don&#39;t lie.</strong> 
The Haavara transfer was a major factor in making possible the immigration of approximately 60,000 German Jews to Palestine in the years 1933-1939, and together with the money invested by the immigrants themselves, in providing an incentive for the expansion of agricultural settlement and for general economic development.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen man. I know about the Autobahn and jet engines. How the Jews got back Israel after losing it to the damn Muslims some 1300 years earlier. I understand the we never found a gas chamber or huge oven. I get that the world population of Jews increased during WW2.</p>

<p>But what you fail to realize is that socialists believe that &quot;people kind&quot; are one organism. A quasi gelatinous blur that is interchangeable. By their own doctrine. &quot;For the greater good&quot;.</p>

<p>Thus they are not people, they are one factor of an idea. An idea that is cancer on this world. Fuck whom ever pushes that failed political bullshit. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t say that some people (jews) and bad because of their blood. Then also believe that other people (oppressed class) are all equal. It&#39;s extremely contradictive. All or none man!</p>

<p>Apartheid </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under SA apartheid or &quot;Jim Crow&quot; laws: there were separate facilities for whites and blacks: separate public washrooms, separate parks, separate drinking fountains, separate restaurants, etc.</p>

<p>All these do not exist in Israel.</p>

<p>Under SA apartheid or &quot;Jim Crow&quot;: blacks had no voice in government or in the courts; they couldn&#39;t be part of mainstream society in politics, professions, the army or police.</p>

<p>In Israel: Arabs vote, work in any profession anywhere, including the army or the police, as lawyers and judges; non-Jewish judges were in the courts that sent a former president of Israel and a former prime minister to prison in Israel! Arabs serve in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. Arabs can visit any park, beach or public facility. They can buy property almost anywhere if they chose to do so. Visit Israeli hospitals and you&#39;ll see Arab and Jewish doctors and nurses working side by side, on Arab and Jewish patients in the same wards and rooms.</p>

<p>The official language of Israel is Hebrew… and Arabic. All the street signs are in Hebrew, Arabic and English.</p>

<p>Where does the apartheid &quot;second class citizen&quot; myth come from? From the same source that the medieval blood libel against Jews came from: ignorance, prejudice, jealousy, pre-conceived stereotypical racist stigma, and from political or religious indoctrination that give an excuse to hate Jews.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ethno-State</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Israel has Asian Jews, Indian Jews, Black Jews, Arab Jews, etc. The idea that Israel is an ethno-paradise is just projection by ethno-purists. It&#39;s a stretch to say Jews around the world separated by 70-100 generations (1750-2500 years) are a single ethnicity. It&#39;s more of a common identity, but I&#39;m personally more related Europeans than I am to a Persian Jew.</p>

<p>Palestinians on the other hand, want to create an ethnostate, with a land that bans women rights, lgbt rights, any jews.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>steal their land.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Judea and Samaria (you call it West bank) is disputed territory. Right now it&#39;s no one&#39;s land but everyone&#39;s. The concept of theft or occupation makes no sense in this context.</p>

<p>Judea and Samaria were given to the Jews by the Mandate for Palestine, as voted on by the League of Nations, and then granted this land again through Partition, by the UN. The only nation to occupy Judea (Yehuda) and Samaria in recent history is therefore Jordan(rescinded claim in &#39;88). The fact that the Arabic word for Jews is derived from the word for Judea, Yahud, gives further lie to the claim that the Jews have occupied Arab land.</p>

<p>The Arabs well know that Judea is the birthright of the Jews and this is reflected in the Arabs’ own native lexicon.</p>

<p>The last time Israel offered a deal to the Palestinians, they were offered 99% of what wanted. If that is the case, they obviously want no Peace.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>indigenous people of Palestine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless of the length of the timeframe of Jewish depopopulation events, Jews have the right to live there under indigenous pretexts. They have the right to live there without threats about thievery on lands for which they are indigenous to.</p>

<p>Some Palestinians share common ancestry with indigenous peoples, but they neither follow indigenous traditions nor do they self-identify as those indigenous peoples. They share neither religion nor language with them. Blood quantum alone is insufficient to transmit indigenous status.</p>

<p>If conquerors, such as the Palestinian Arabs, can become indigenous, then the white Europeans who came to my indigenous lands in North America could now claim to be indigenous. The white Europeans who went to Australia and New Zealand could now claim to be indigenous. If we, even once, allow that argument to be made, indigenous rights are suddenly devalued and meaningless. This is somewhat peculiar, as those who are arguing for Palestinian “indigenous rights” are usually those who have little grasp of the history, and no understanding of the truth behind indigenous rights.</p>

<p>Israel was always considered home for Jews. Way before Zionism, Jews have made the trip to the Land.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would I bother to answer a comment made by a serial plagiarist who copy-pasted material originally posted by a Zionist zealot doing a nit-picky semantic tap-dance in a pathetic attempt to &quot;justify&quot; the abhorrent racist policies and practices of the Zionist state, and the inherent racist supremasim that runs to the marrow of the bones of many (if not most) of the Jews who live there?</p>

<p>One dishonest, conniving racist jerk plagiarizes another dishonest, conniving racist jerk, and that deserves an &quot;answer&quot;?</p>

<p>Not in this thread. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s another example of U/ChillandBreath plagiarizing <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Ss4i6V1.png">2 different sources in one comment.</a> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s his comment: <a href="https://archive.is/n9j6G">https://archive.is/n9j6G</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the &quot;White Supremacist&quot; page he first plagiarized: <a href="https://archive.is/gO4sf">https://archive.is/gO4sf</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the Quora comment that he plagiarized further down: <a href="https://archive.is/ZDBzs">https://archive.is/ZDBzs</a></p>

<p>My mirrored room, my secret life</p>

<p>It&#39;s lonely here,</p>

<p>There&#39;s no one left to torture</p>

<p>Give me absolute control</p>

<p>Over every living soul</p>

<p>And lie beside me, baby</p>

<p>That&#39;s an order</p>

<p>Give me crack and anal sex</p>

<p>Take the only tree that&#39;s left</p>

<p>And stuff it up the hole</p>

<p>In your culture</p>

<p>Give me back the Berlin wall</p>

<p>Won&#39;t be nothing</p>

<p>Nothing you can measure anymore</p>

<p>The blizzard, the blizzard of the world</p>

<p>Has crossed the threshold</p>

<p>The order of the soul</p>

<p>Any further</p>

<p>And now the wheels of heaven stop</p>

<p>You feel the devil&#39;s riding crop</p>

<p>Get ready for the future</p>

<p>It is murder</p>

<p>There&#39;ll be the breaking of the ancient
Western code</p>

<p>Your private life will suddenly explode</p>

<p>There&#39;ll be phantoms</p>

<p>There&#39;ll be fires on the road</p>

<p>And the white man dancing</p>

<p>You&#39;ll see a woman</p>

<p>Hanging upside down</p>

<p>Her features covered by her fallen gown</p>

<p>And all the lousy little poets</p>

<p>Coming round</p>

<p>Tryin&#39; to sound like Charlie Manson</p>

<p>And the white man dancin&#39;</p>

<p>Give me back the Berlin wall</p>

<p>Give me Stalin and St. Paul</p>

<p>Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima</p>
