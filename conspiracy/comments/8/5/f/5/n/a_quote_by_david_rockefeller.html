    <div class="md"><p>Its a fantastic idea, if you are one of the few to hold power. If you are instead under the rule of a one world government, how would you oppose their decisions/rulings? Where would you go to escape a ruling you perceive to be shitty? How would you hold onto rights that they deem unnecessary? One government means one military, one police force, etc. How COULD YOU oppose anything? Your freedom/choice would disappear... Now, explain to me why a global government would be a &#39;good idea.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do not forget the fact that if that government treats people poorly, that it&#39;s not a small country that can rebel, it&#39;s the entire human population. </p>

<p>I believe a world government is a better idea for us as citizens of the world, than it is for the elite who want to stay in power. The world would demand proper governance and freedoms. I do not see how a government, or any military, could control the worlds population in a malicious manner without some kind of revolt. It doesn&#39;t make sense that billions of people would just shrug it off.</p>

<p>People in America might be pussies, but there are billions of people on this planet who continue to fight governments on a daily basis, and will never be happy living under any kind of oppression. Think about India, Thailand, China, Greece, Ireland, and many more.</p>

<p>It&#39;s that fear, that could keep the elite from taking control of the world, unless, it is on truly good terms, for everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain to me why a global government would be a bad idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I gave you three reasons; 1) Their decisions would override yours. 2) If you wanted to leave, you couldn&#39;t [see flumphead&#39;s point]. 3) One government equates to one army backing up said government&#39;s decisions/plans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;re making a vast level of assumptions with absolutely nothing to back up those claims.</p>

<p>Actually, you&#39;re right on one point; I&#39;m making assumptions, but I&#39;m basing them on the history of humanity... look into it, or go on believing your own assumptions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll give you a concrete example in very simple terms.  </p>

<p>My home country is run by evil guys one the &#39;bezzle.  So I moved to another country for a better life.  It is possible to do this if you are a useful individual.</p>

<p>Under a world government this would be impossible, and indeed there would be no limit to the leaders&#39; mismanagement - there would be nowhere for the brain drain to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the USA and other First World, Industrialized Nations represent 90% of the wealth, but only 10% of the population. Put the UN in charge via a global government and we&#39;ll see a massive ramp in taxation to take care of all the needy people in the Third World.</p>

<p>Or at least, that will be how they sell it.</p>

<p>But in typical political style, that money will be channeled through friends, dictators, cohorts and very, very little will reach the poster children in any meaningful manner. After all, if they ever managed to &quot;cure&quot; world hunger, then they wouldn&#39;t be able to tax us anymore, would they?</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the level of separation between you and political leaders would increase. If you have ever been to a city council meeting, you have an idea of how representation works. But how well do you feel served by your legislator that works in your State Capital? What about your congressional reps in your Nation&#39;s Capital? Have you ever sent them a piece of your mind and gotten a meaningless form letter back? Did you vote against the bailout along with 98% of America and then watch in amazement as they approved it anyway because, 536 individuals in Washington DC know better than 360,000,000 Americans what&#39;s best for everyone? And didn&#39;t it turn out great?</p>

<p>Yea, world government would be even better!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you&#39;re only saying, &quot;it would be bad&quot;. You&#39;re using hearsay and factoids for proof and legitimacy of your argument. </p>

<p>And as a matter of factoid (since we&#39;re on the subject of unprovable factoids) I live in DC. I chanced a meeting with one of my <em>local</em> representatives in a bar one evening and had a very lively, but humane discussion well into the night about that fucking bullshit baseball stadium our bow-tied bitch of a former Mayor wanted. We couldn&#39;t change each others minds in the end, however, we left with an understanding of where the other was coming from much more thoroughly. I wanted my nightclubs, concert halls, bars, restaurants and Section 8 housing, and (*)s/he wanted a lower crime rate by evicting dead-beat tenants that sold drugs/alcohol and weapons to school children.  We both had our points, mine being that the night life kept people busy on more nights a week (essentially) than a baseball stadium ever could, and they wanted to clean up the worst quarter of the city that regularly competed for the highest murder rate in the country. </p>

<p>My point here is that you can&#39;t say your elected officials are totally unreachable. If you find your officials unreachable, you&#39;re probably not looking for them the right way. They have houses with mailboxes (or P.O. Boxes), or lawns to put signs on. They go to grocery stores and and poop just like you do. You&#39;re elevating them to a god-like levels of power that is at best, laughable, and at the least, conceded. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like where you&#39;re home town/county/district/state is going, get off your ass and run for office against the asshole who you think is mucking about. Go look for them on their spare time and talk to them like a human being. Put a human face on the issue, it will influence their decisions whether or not you choose to believe it (unless they&#39;re robots, and if SkyNet&#39;s already taken over we&#39;ve got bigger problems).</p>

<p>As for your statement about over taxing the population, the next time you go walk down the sidewalk, see someone taking a bus or a subway, or going to a public school or library, remember that your tax dollars payed for that. If you don&#39;t think that those things are properly financed, I would advise you to do something productive about it (like running for public office). </p>

<p>Is there a vast network of well connected officials who will stop at nothing to keep the status quo of &quot;us vs them&quot;? Yeah, probably, but remember that there is strength in numbers so if there is vast conspiracy group of people dedicated to the downfall of modern society so that they can set up some sort of dictatorship that will enevitably ursurp the massive number independent nations and goverments that are constantly waring and clashing with one another for frivolous reasons, grab your friends, some pitch forks and torches and storm their castle. Technically speaking, it is Constitutional. </p>

<p>I&#39;m open to convincing, however I tend to see more excuses and soapbox shouting than actual proof positive. But on that note, if there were proof positive, wouldn&#39;t the vast conspiracy eradicate any trace of it?  </p>

<p>(*)can&#39;t name the official I met as the discussion was very &quot;off the record&quot;, drunken and heated. So it goes...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just the very beginning. It will not happen in our lifetime, maybe not even our childrens lifetime. 
Wanna be world leaders understand something of this magnitude will take time and technology and the weakening of mankinds thoughts. They use us to invent and create new technologies and will in turn use these against us to manipulate and control us. Everyone requiring a microchip seems wild but I think they will be able to sell it and enforce it as well. 
The United States itself is apart of this agenda and the Federal Reserve act of 1913 proves this. Now it was not the United States&#39; agenda at first, but after we lose our patriotic founding fathers, the children of the rockefellers, rothchilds, etc, (and many other bloodline orientated human beings) are passed down the knowledge and wealth to continue the main agenda... Which is a global government or the term we often hear New World Order. 
The ruling of the world has been an objective of mankind for thousands of years. Because of technology it has become possible.

    <div class="md"><p>As you&#39;re assuming it wouldn&#39;t be bad. The conundrum here is that it has &quot;never been tried.&quot; Therefore, we don&#39;t &quot;know&quot; how it would be. However, with the  understanding of the way our leaders think, act, undermine sovereignty (UN), utilize regional currency (Euro), spy on us, lie about transparency, and understanding the drive of world leaders in previous eras (Hitler, Stalin, even Oliver Cromwell) one could surmise that yes, yes it would be bad. Your independence and ability to function as-is would be inhibited, who would you turn to in the face of disagreement? Our Founders would not approve of the notion of a world government, yet we have them living in New York. The closest I think I could compare it to would be communism. In a communist country, you have very few freedoms and EVERYTHING is controlled by the government. That&#39;s what a one world government would be, in my estimation and you will have a hard time refuting that because it&#39;s assuming on both parts. Communism has only killed about 100 million people throughout history, it can&#39;t be that bad and surely it has to work at some point, right? </p>

<p>Actually the conspiracies like the Rockefeller statement above have been ongoing for quite some time. As a lot of conspiracies have. Conspiracies are in the past, present and future.</p>

<p>All you have to do is look around you. You think their isn&#39;t evil in this world? There are world dominating conspiracies going on constantly....especially here in America....what planet you from again?</p>

<p>You think a conspiracy happens instantly do ya? It comes and goes in the blink of an eye?</p>

<p>Are you expecting them to come out and say &quot;okay I&#39;m now entering into a conspiracy to rule the world....just so you all know&quot;?</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah conspiracies can&#39;t exist if I just stick my head in this bucket of sand over here.&quot; and &quot;I can&#39;t be blamed if I didn&#39;t know the truth&quot; don&#39;t actually work in reality.</p>

<p>It really doesn&#39;t take much research to learn the truth. People just have to be willing to do it and get over the &quot;you&#39;re a crazy nut job for questioning your government&quot; mentality that society tries to keep their own selves down with in order to keep from having to lift a finger to do anything about the evil.</p>

<p>These people are robbing you blind and you&#39;re like huh? What? Conspiracy?</p>

<p>OMGosh it&#39;s truly priceless. This country is nothing but a bunch of chickens running around with their heads cut off.</p>

<p>Who is robbing us blind? I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m personally being robbed. I&#39;m wondering what this is in reference to?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;feel&quot; your talking about is the problem. Oddly enough that&#39;s the only thing keeping food in our mouths right now. That false understanding of reality that&#39;s destined to come crashing down. I.E. &quot;the bubble&quot;.</p>

<p>Stop using &#39;feelings&#39; and start getting real and you will know what and who.</p>

<p>&quot;personally being robbed&quot; --- Realize that when you don&#39;t stand for others in their time of need there won&#39;t be anyone there for you in your time of need. Ya know it may not be you yet...but it&#39;ll happen. Either to you later on or to your kids or your kids kids. Society can&#39;t live by only looking through rose colored glasses. This fake kingdom will come crashing down. And make no mistake about it those that lust after the fake kingdom will blame those who lust after truth and reality and rightousness. Unfortunately those who lust after the fake kingdom are the ones in charge right now and they have the worlds biggest guns at their disposal!</p>

<p>Who you gonna be?</p>

<p>If you really want to know go to infowars.com</p>

<p>Start listening to people like Alex Jones. Listen to someone that&#39;s reality based not someone that society tells you is crazy because they question their government! Not someone who makes stuff up or distorts the truth. That&#39;s what those who are robbing you and me and our childrens future do. People like Alex are doing everything they can to help us keep what we have. When you study people like Alex you see that what he says gains him and us nothing more than what he/we already have but when you listen to people like Rockefeller everything they say is designed to get them more and more and more and you less and less and less.</p>

<p>People have got to learn to discern fake from real better. In these times that&#39;s going to be harder and harder.</p>

<p>This is in reference to the conspiracy by Rockefeller and his buddies trying to rule the world. Did you not read the quote? The who would be Rockefeller and his buddies, people like the Rothschilds, people like Geitner, Greenspan, the Clinton&#39;s, Obamee, the Bush&#39;s and on and on and on.</p>
