        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As we all know, from time to time (seems to come in waves) flat earth theories pop up here every so often. There have been multiple attempts, using math and various other equations to both prove, or disprove the theory, all with rather...well mixed results.</p>

<p>The more I&#39;ve thought about this particular theory, the more I think that there would be a somewhat easy (if costly) way to really settle the argument once and for all.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the test I propose, please tell me what your thoughts on the subject are.</p>

<p>First you acquire (likely rent) a pair of identical airliners which have enough range to cross the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Second, you would need an airport with two parallel runways.</p>

<p>Third, you would need a pair of crews and a control group (scientific meaning) of syncronized time pieces.</p>

<p>The experiment:</p>

<p>Both planes are given a full load of fuel, and take off at the same time, or at the very least within minutes of each other.  One crew flies a straight path with minimal deviation from London to NY, or vice versa.  The second flight uses the usual curved path that cross atlantic flights use, again with minimal deviation.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the payout, so to speak, for the experiment.</p>

<p>If the world is round, then the flight taking the second path should take roughly 8 hours to transit the path (give or take 1 hour due to weather or deviations),  while the straight path should take roughly 14 hours (give or take an hour).  </p>

<p>Alternatively, if the earth is flat,  then the flight times would be reversed; with the straight path plane arriving first, and the curved one being the later one.</p>

<p>As to the control group of time keeping, each plane carries syncronized clocks to verify that they did not overly deviate from their flight paths.  IE, the straight path doesn&#39;t circle somewhere over the ocean to make the flight take longer.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, when you watch the clip of the car floating through &quot;space&quot; you can see at one point that the earth glitches, as if the camera feed is fuzzy for a bit. The problem is that if it were a camera glitch, all objects in the frame would be affected, but no, it&#39;s just the earth. Secondly, you can see off in the distance what spacex alleges to be the moon. It&#39;s so effing tiny. It looks bigger from earth! There&#39;s no way that it&#39;s an actual representation. And of course the feed tends to cut out at the times where the deception is at most risk of being exposed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At 1:22 in this video you can see the &quot;moon&quot; pass from left to right, behind the car in the lower portion of the video. There&#39;s no way that&#39;s an accurate representation of the moon because the angular size of the moon from earth is much larger. This video&#39;s representation of the moon does not match our direct observation. Here&#39;s the link: <a href="https://youtu.be/LD-E3ZCjBho">https://youtu.be/LD-E3ZCjBho</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>What’s your background in education that you can for certain say that’s not an accurate representation of the moon? Cuz I bet you don’t have one. And I have no idea what caused the small black line to appear in the video, just as you don’t. To take the fact of the bars existence and stretch it to reach the conclusion the earth is flat is nonsensical. Simply gather data to prove the earth is flat, or yet do some basic measurements and arithmetic to realize we live on a spherically shaped planet </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All you&#39;ve done is berate my ability to make an argument and then dismiss my evidence without a proper effort to come to an understanding together. So if anyone lacks self awareness it is you. You keep claiming I&#39;m making claims with no evidence. The claim being made is that the fucking car is floating in space around a ball earth. That&#39;s the claim that requires extraordinary evidence. Me saying &quot;the video evidence of star man doesn&#39;t support the theory that it was launched into space&quot; is telling you that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I&#39;m not the original one making a claim. It&#39;s Spacex and they didn&#39;t provide the extraordinary evidence that even you mentioned is required. So the fact that you don&#39;t see that and you&#39;re just berating me means that you&#39;re either a troll who is doing it for laughs or just a stupid, confident asshole.</p>

<p>When you change latitude (which flying from Brazil to Paris entails) you experience the Coriolis effect because your initial eastward velocity near the equator is very large due to the Earth&#39;s rotation, but as you travel north the eastward velocity of the Earth beneath you gets smaller and smaller, effectively meaning that you will overshoot eastward of your destination.</p>

<p>Implying any old schmuck can&#39;t calculate the distance to the Moon/Sun and their respective sizes. You don&#39;t need to be NASA to figure this stuff out. You can get the values within a reasonable error margin with a few good observations. </p>

<p>Charon would like a word with you. Granted, Pluto is a dwarf planet, but it still applies. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Forgot to mention it is also tidally locked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ya, so what? Tidal locking is pretty common, at least in this solar system. Mercury is locked in a 3:2, all of the Galilean Moons are locked, Titan&#39;s locked, Titania and Miranda are locked, Triton&#39;s locked and Pluto is locked together with Charon. 100% I&#39;m missing others, but the point is that it doesn&#39;t seem to be a rarity. Big Moons tend to get locked it seems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right about one thing: my argument is that it&#39;s improbable. If our solar system was created according to leading scientific theories, and if our moon was created according to the modern theory that a larger object hit the earth, then it&#39;s absolutely improbable to say all of that produced a moon that is both tidally locked AND larger than any other planet-moon system AND that it happens to be exactly 400 times smaller and closer than the sun. The probability of all these being true about our system is insanely low. Like almost 0.</p>

<p>Improbable, yes. Impossible? No. Again, this is an appeal to improbability. What you&#39;re basically saying is that because something is highly improbable, it is impossible. Regardless, saying &quot;these things were unlikely to happen&quot; is meaningless. It doesn&#39;t change the fact that they DID happen and things are the way they are. The moon IS tidally locked. It IS a certain size. We ARE a certain distance from the Sun. </p>

<p>You and I being the winning sperm/egg out of ~100 million/~2 million was improbable. Doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t exist. We are the results of a random event. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are admitting some bridges prove a flat Earth. What was the point in using one to try and prove curvature then? The fact that any bridge disproves curvature means that curvature does not exist.</p>

<p>As for photos of flat Earth from various height/angles, here you go:</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cPQjbkj1D88/VNsuIyql6SI/AAAAAAAAPjQ/WR5X-bPX_8k/s1600/flat-earth-is-flat.jpg">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cPQjbkj1D88/VNsuIyql6SI/AAAAAAAAPjQ/WR5X-bPX_8k/s1600/flat-earth-is-flat.jpg</a></p>

<p>The fact that GoPro&#39;s create a false curvature means they cannot be used as proof the Earth is round.</p>

<p>&quot;That has a lot to do with the GoPro&#39;s wide-angle lens: The wide lens, while amazing for capturing different perspectives, can also be a crutch of the GoPro. The GoPro has a wide lens, and only a wide lens. This creates barrel distortion, better known as a fisheye effect.&quot;</p>

<p>Hmmm.... well I take it you dont really understand lenses then? You can change the FoV to remove fisheye or use a different lens... </p>

* Go to the northern hemisphere. Find Polaris. 
* Choose a star on the celestial equator.
* Calculate viewing angle between Polaris and your chosen Star.
* Go to the southern hemisphere. 
* Find your chosen Star and Sigma Octantis. 
* Calculate viewing angle between them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Realize that Polaris and Sigma Octantis have an angular difference of 180 degrees. </li>
<li>Try to place that on this thing.

<p>Two things check out this link <a href="https://takethisskepticalblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/21/how-to-disprove-the-flat-earth/">https://takethisskepticalblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/21/how-to-disprove-the-flat-earth/</a></p>

<p>It lays out a very clear guide as to how to prove the Sun is not a close object and why debunking Eratosthenes experiment would only work from one location and one measurement. </p>

<p>Secondly a really simple thought experiemtn would be to ask yourself why the sun moves 15 degrees an hour every hour from any point on the planet. </p>

<p>For that to happen the world would have to be a globe, there is no explanation as to how the sun does this in any system besides a heliocentric one. </p>

<p>You dont think its a bit disingenuous to say we cant use observations to figure this out? I dont have a rocket ship, do you? </p>

<p>So why does the sun move in such a way that is only explained on a globe earth? </p>
