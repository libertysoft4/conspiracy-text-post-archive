        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In response to:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/78of7n/proof_liberalism_is_a_mental_disorder/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/78of7n/proof_liberalism_is_a_mental_disorder/</a></p>

<p>I figured I&#39;d throw in my two cents. While I don&#39;t really believe &quot;conservatism is a mental disorder&quot; the way many here often describe <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/78of7n/proof_liberalism_is_a_mental_disorder/">liberalism as a mental disorder</a>, I can&#39;t help but notice that there do seem to be some correlations. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lower Cognitive Ability Predicts Greater Prejudice Through Right-Wing Ideology and Low Intergroup Contact</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611421206">http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611421206</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Conservatism and cognitive ability</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://davesource.com/Fringe/Fringe/Politics/Conservatism-and-cognitive-ability.pdf">http://davesource.com/Fringe/Fringe/Politics/Conservatism-and-cognitive-ability.pdf</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Psychoticism, Immature Defense Mechanisms and a Fearful Attachment Style are Associated with a Higher Homophobic Attitude</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jsm.12975">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jsm.12975</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, there does appear to be some correlation between conservatism, homophobia, racism, low IQ, and mental illness.</p>

<p>I keep seeing the phrase, &quot;liberalism is a mental illness&quot; and I figured in the spirit of an honest and fair discussion we ought to have the opposing viewpoint represented here too. This view seems to be supported by objective analysis and not just memes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing irks me more that the &quot;blank is a mental disease/disorder&quot; meme. It should be &quot;overly emotional partisan bickering is a mental disorder&quot;. Or, &quot;allowing your emotional health and attention be dictated to you by others is a mental disorder&quot;.</p>

<p>We&#39;re all like little children allowing our emotional buttons to be pushed so we can all be lead around by the nose. The dark hand is at work to keep us that way, it&#39;s always been like that but social media has amplified this by 1000%. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to suggest there are two radically different perspectives in people: rural people vs city people.  City people have a more comprehensive view of social dynamics but they&#39;re also more corrupted by them.  This group tends to regard themselves as liberal.  Rural people have more naivety about society but they are also less corrupted by society.  They tend to call themselves conservatives.</p>

<p>My point is these different personal backgrounds and perspectives should be respected by people on the opposite side.  The opposite side is not your enemy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe the other side is the enemy, but let&#39;s be real, conservatives have been demonizing liberals for years.  The Tea Party was a step shy of declaring civil war over ideology.  We see rural governors like Matt Bevin suggesting civil war if they lose elections.  Liberal is used as a pejorative.  The SJW stuff targets liberal minded Americans.  It&#39;s rural Americans trying to pass laws to discriminate against other groups of Americans.  The liberals havent declared conservatives the enemy but its getting closer and closer as the politicians keep passing legislation that is designed to punish other groups of Americans.  We&#39;ve become a nation where politics is a form of retribution against the opposition party instead of Americans coming together for the benefit of all Americans.</p>

<p>For the last 20 years, we&#39;ve become more polarized and more paralyzed when it comes to solutions that are mutually beneficial.  Look at the tax cuts they just passed that benefit red states and punish blue states.  Look at the attack on states rights as it relates to sanctuary cities, ironically, by the same people who stood up for states rights when Obama was President and their states refused to implement regulations designed to protect the public.</p>

<p>I am fine with people having different perspectives, but take a step back and look at how things really are.  The right is at war with the left in America.  Even if you&#39;re a Republican, you get called a Democrat if you go against the ideology promoted on conservative radio and TV.  Guys who have been Republicans their entire are ostracized for being centrist or moderate.  It&#39;s like there is a purity test and if you&#39;re even slightly reasonable or believe in compromise you&#39;re a RINO.  More than half of Republicans think Comey, McCabe and Mueller are Democrats.</p>

<p>As you can see, there does appear to be some correlation between conservatism, homophobia, racism, low IQ, and mental illness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Homophobia, sort of. This stems from Christian values, not conservatism as a political philosophy, although this is not clinical homophobia. We&#39;re talking about the belief in homosexuality as ethically wrong, mostly. I&#39;d say many conservatives don&#39;t experience actual homophobia when they interact with homosexuals. Some, sure. Most, probably not, or at least not to the extent of having a mental illness of some kind.</p>

<p>Racism, absolutely. Some of the last places where actual, nasty, in your face racism exist are definitively red states where Conservatism is king. The only racists in the left camp are those that are prejudice against white people, and I don&#39;t imagine studies like this are even considering those kinds of sentiments as racism, but rather enlightened social justice.</p>

<p>Mental illness is where we begin taking a serious leap in logic here. The argument that Conservatives are homophobic, and thus by extension also mentally ill, is based in the assessment that rather than being prejudice against homosexuals, or even more mildly, just believing that homosexuals live their lives in an unethical fashion by virtue of being homosexual.</p>

<p>Low IQ. This may actually be true, but it doesn&#39;t really say much. Higher IQ people aren&#39;t automatically correct in their political beliefs. That&#39;s not how that works, so it really only suggests that Conservatives are less cognitively equipped to perform the mental activities by which we judge intelligence. Someone with a high IQ can be incredibly wrong, because while their brains process information efficiently, they may be exposed to all the wrong information. The ability to critical think is not the same as the ability to process information quickly.</p>

<p>As you can see, there does appear to be some correlation between conservatism, homophobia, racism, low IQ, and mental illness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note, huge demographic shifts occurred coming out of the 2016 election. Large number of independent and formerly dem voters rallied behind what they perceived to be the anti-establishment politics choice. Got a long unprecedented look at how much the electoral system is manipulated. Were disgusted by the shrill shaming, name-calling, and disgusting bullying tactics deployed at all levels. Became appalled by the lack of substance in the campaign platform, and lack of flexibility for negotiation on points that historically were classical liberal positions. For a host of reasons they noped on out of there. For many this was the first time they took a step back and asked why, exactly, they aligned with the left and could not come up with satisfactory answers given recent behavior.</p>

<p>The integrity issue is the big one the left will not allow people to rightfully call out and discuss. The leadership is rotten and those bad apples spread it to the rest of the party. There has been months of outrage and distraction to try and wait out long enough for people to forget. There are some things you just can&#39;t unsee.</p>

<p>The flagrant manipulation of the electoral system was to the point where the DNC defense in the Florida lawsuit is that they&#39;re allowed to pick winners in back rooms because they&#39;re a private entity. Let that sink in. The position is that the primary does not have to be a fair election by civil means, thus the public does not have the right to a vote in the outcome. It is completely unacceptable to work to strip voter rights away. The alternative is transfer of power solely by uncivil means, if one is to have a voice in the process. That&#39;s a horrific outcome we cannot allow to take place.</p>

<p>As a result we have HUGE fluid shift in voter populations within the last year and a half or so. I&#39;d argue these shifts are sufficiently large as to make the results of these studies largely inaccurate. On review the studies primarily identify traditional conservative leaning voters, many of which supported establishment right candidates.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, the left is screwed up and hopefully they can reform. Still, I suspect many people have bought more into propaganda and emotional manipulation than have objectively considered the situation and come to an informed opinion. </p>

<p>I say this because it seems to be difficult to have objective, honest conversations about these issues, and I believe it’s because this narrative was consciously cultivated and pushed. Think “constantly under attack”, “deplorables”, “derangement” (yeah it’s happening on both sides of the aisle).</p>

Most of the people I have met that will actually admit they voted for trump simply hated Hillary and the DNC a lot more. As for Russian propaganda I don&#39;t personally think that any of it swayed the election in any kind of meaningful way. I mean maybe they just wanted to sow some divisiveness in the US and if that was their goal it seems to have worked. &quot;everyone does it&quot; ... well not saying I think its great but yeah everyone does do it... particularly the USA when it comes to meddling in other counties politics. Remember when we caused the collapse of the Soviet union? Do some digging on exactly how all that went down if you feel like be disgusted with the states more than you already are.    </p>

<p>Idk, take your pick really. It could be the complete deadlock of the political season which is now neverending too. Which is why we have a president who as already started campaigning and the targeted politicization of children to take the mantle too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I’ve seen the bill itself. I was just hoping to see something that’s actually come out of it.

<p>Like do we have any reason to believe we are being hit with propaganda as a result of this bill, or are we simply assuming it to be the case and then assuming we are able to identify which stories are propaganda and resulting from the bill?</p>

<p>I’m with you on seeing a lot of propaganda on this sub though. There’s an incredible amount of pro-Trump propaganda here, and it’s pretty obvious what is propaganda and what is just trump supporters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you only see the Trump side of the brigades?</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually fairly curious on this one. I&#39;m able to see ample evidence of vote manipulation, brigading, and downright forum sliding from each sect of our political spectrum. I noticed that you pinged out Trump supporters spreading a incredible amount, but I believe we are swarmed with it from every angle at this point. Everyone is vying for complete control of social media now that news can be curated based on region and basic profile information. It&#39;s just the effect of our enhanced spying system combined with complete cooperation with corporate interests on how best to market to us.</p>

<p>Strange behavior like: vote patterns staying locked at -1 so that they remain hidden (usually solely negative one, I&#39;m not kidding, check some of the hidden comments), and the counterpoint which never features hyperlinks, or anything broader than an appeal to the audience with a near &quot;Just look at em&quot; style attack.</p>

<p>Top comments decrying the Trump spam is always bombarded to the top of threads, and any appeal to the idea that this may be a multifaceted assault is downvoted and berated by two-three accounts (on average per thread). </p>

<p>You want to know the weirdest part, is that it shifts. It will change from morning to night, from night to morning. Complete brigades of posts from every possible angle (racial, right, left, postmodern, religious). It&#39;s a god damn madhouse in every thread that houses a word or phrase that is deemed &quot;controversial&quot;.</p>

<p>Have you noticed any of these strange occurrences in the sub?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely see the anti-Trump “brigades”, although honestly I suspect most brigades (on both sides) aren’t actually organized brigades. Sure there’s TMOR and T_D, but I think most of these heavily upvoted/downvoted posts are the result of real users voting.</p>

<p>I say this because there’s a bit of an art to burying or pushing a topic. You don’t just spam downvotes and nasty comments, you give it a few downvotes and no comments.</p>

<p>That being said, I feel like reddit in general leans left and everyone here seems to think the sub is being brigaded when really it’s just majority rule as it is in most subs.</p>

<p>In terms of actual propaganda, I should mention one of the subs that isn’t majority rule (free voting), which is T_D. That sub is literally designed to push pro-Trump propaganda, and it says so in the rules and you will be banned for going against that narrative.</p>

<p>So yeah, I think there’s more pro-Trump propaganda than anti-Trump propaganda here, in terms of outright falsehoods, misrepresentations, and specific phrasing to appeal to emotions.</p>

<p>Just for the sake of this discussion, any chance you have an example of some anti-Trump propaganda that you think is being pushed here by shills or the like?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See I don&#39;t look at things as purely anti-trump, anyone could thumb that into anything discussed on this sub somehow. They are there, and the dogpiling is incredibly real on those posts. </p>

<p>The goal isn&#39;t to be anti-trump, it&#39;s to fully destroy the sub itself. They do not want content that is actually relevant to be discussed (such as a possibility that we may invade syria or iran). It&#39;s to avoid naming names of actual criminals and to focus our efforts on the circus in front of us. This is Whitewater all over again, an actual crime clouded by immense bureaucracy. And everyone knows the &#39;political&#39; elites can get away with whatever they almighty dollar allows.</p>

<p>They do not want content that makes countries and politicians look unfavorable so they slide them and call them propaganda. They attempt to shame anyone who even begins to think differently. We are no longer able to look at events earnestly without having to deal with attacks on character, and blatant ridicule of actually attempting to entertain and look into a conspiracy. When did mocking users actually contributing to posts become a thing this sub became cool with? </p>

<p>It&#39;s about clouding the air, thumbing in the talking points and keeping us riled up on issues that, as a country realistically will not be able to fix until another 50 years to a century, especially so since the whole 15 year war nonsense and giant buyouts ensured that we will forever be debt enslaved.</p>

<p>I wanted to clear that bit up so that it wasn&#39;t misinterpreted, I&#39;m not pro trump, I&#39;m completely antimarketing, antipropaganda, antiwar and what most people before 2016 would call a Classical liberal. </p>

<p><strong>But the best examples just take clicking into TMOR honestly,</strong></p>

<p>Besides examples such as TMOR posting in direct response to threads, such as the one alluding to conspiracy reaching 600,000 users. </p>

<p><strong><em>Why would that be a point of contention?</em></strong> </p>

<p>They actually are still trying to eliminate some mods and rise themselves into a position of power into the sub. They talk about breaking conspiracy users will, and even today are talking about trying to put posts into contest mode to attempt to make the sub unreadable.</p>

<p>Go to the video of Assad driving today on this sub, notice how the comments portray him just like 2000 era Saddam? That&#39;s the tap tap tapping of the war drum.</p>

<p>Subs big enough for a lot of people, weird how the voices dictate what is and isn&#39;t appropriate conspiracy conversation.</p>

<p>Psychoticism, Immature Defense Mechanisms and a Fearful Attachment Style are Associated with a Higher Homophobic Attitude</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is my favorite one since it first requires that you ignore the fact the homosexuality is objectively a mental disorder.  No offense to anyone and I don&#39;t mind homosexuals or discriminate against them, but the first thing a homosexual will confess to you is that they started out life very confused and always trying to patch up whatever is wrong with them, that they could tell they were different.  It&#39;s apparent even to them, just a question of would you rather be happy and embrace the mental disorder or be miserable and hate yourself for being different.</p>

<p>Transgenderism, homosexuality, psychopathy even schizophrenia are all divergent mental states.  Not suited to maximize the potential for reproduction or even personal survival.  But divergent states both mental and physical are apparently the mechanism through which we evolved so who am I to judge individuals for their unique state?  So I don&#39;t judge them, I just recognize what they are and accept them for that.  What I won&#39;t do is agree to their definition of what is normal or what is desirable.</p>

Acting like you have an invisible being of good on your side vs everyone else as evil as something in reality. NEWS FLASH there is no God.  Like people being gay really harms you, buck the fuck up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s 2 possibilities for people. Either they mostly want to keep things the way they are (conservatism), or they want to change the things (progressivism).</p>

<p>You either want to maintain the old, or you want to change the old into something new.</p>

<p>Most people are a mix. Even modern progressives will eventually become conservatives if their ideas and goals are realized.</p>

<p>The modern political spectrum of partisan politics is a strict adherence to these ideas (old or new) with zero compromise. This is why both sides accuse the other of being a mental disorder.</p>

<p>Being flexible and willing to compromise or be persuaded to another point of view is why so many people are &quot;moderates&quot;. </p>
