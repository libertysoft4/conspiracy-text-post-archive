<p>In an internal FDA memo (8/21/90) to Paul Leber, M.D., director of the Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products, Psychiatric Drug Products group leader Thomas Laughren, M.D. agreed that much of <strong><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upjohn">Upjohn&#39;s</a> information concerning withdrawal events was &quot;often poorly organized and confusing.&quot; The official expressed &quot;frustration that so little useful data have emerged...&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>An earlier memo (8/6/90) to Dr. Leber from Thomas Temple felt XANAX&#39;s effectiveness was &quot;clearly shown&quot;, the potential for drug withdrawal phenomena was &quot;clearly the area of main concern for two principal reasons. First, there is the matter of seizures... In addition, there is the issue of lifelong dependence, i.e., inability to discontinue therapy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The FDA has approved a drug in high dosages (up to 10 mg per day) for the treatment of panic disorder without evidence that it is safe for long-term prescription.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s examine the three trials, which were used by quoting a few written comments of FDA consultant Hillary Lee, Ph.D. (Statistical Review and Evaluation of 12/21/88). Keep in mind that, as is the custom, the manufacturer Upjohn sponsored these surveys. The FDA merely reviews their reports: &quot;The trials, studies 4404, 4412, and 4432, were conducted sequentially from April, 1983 to May 1985.&quot; Follow-up was ten weeks or less. An initial question you might ask is <strong>what happened to the subjects since 1985? - There is no data on this.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Study 4404: A 10-week flexible dose, single-centered, double blind, parallel, placebo controlled multicenter clinical 8-week trial. One comment was, <strong>&quot;it is disconcerting to note that the Dupont center, which had the largest sample size (19% of the total sample) and one of the lowest placebo dropout rates, showed a larger decrease in number of panic attacks of the placebo group than for the alprazolam group.&quot; In other words, in this center treatment with XANAX was worse than no treatment at all!</strong> As to the panic attack effect, the reviewer noted, &quot;only one center showed significant difference...&quot; between alprazolam and placebo. However at the dose of approximately 5 mg alprazolam was judged to be more effective than no treatment at all in the treatment of phobias.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The criterion by which XANAX effectiveness was judged was mean reduction of panic episodes per week. By that measure, one may reasonably suggest general anesthesia as a method of treatment (e.g., panic attacks would be reduced to zero and the procedure is FDA approved as generally safe). There are many other qualitative and quantitative indicators of reduction of panic attacks over the short term that these studies were conducted.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In a memo (8/11/89) to the FDA Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee (PDAC), Drs. Leber and Laughren indicated, &quot;the single most significant concern associated with the use of XANAX in the treatment of panic and phobia behaviors is an increased (compared to current recommended uses) risk of dependence and withdrawal phenomena...Information gathered during the eight years of XANAX&#39;s domestic marketing for the management of anxiety disorders documents that the use of XANAX is consistently associated with reports of dependence and withdrawal phenomena...<strong>we are especially concerned that a recommendation for higher doses...will lead to an increased incidence of these untoward phenomena.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In the same memo the doctors added that HALCION (triazolam), a benzodiazepine sedative/hypnotic of Upjohn&#39;s, &quot;continues to exhibit an excess of adverse events...&quot; in spite of lower dose recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In the same memo the doctors added that HALCION (triazolam), a benzodiazepine sedative/hypnotic of Upjohn&#39;s, &quot;continues to exhibit an excess of adverse events...&quot; in spite of lower dose recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>On March 20, Dr. Laughren, in referring to long-term therapy of up to eight months, wrote a memo for the file that mentioned there was <strong>no &quot;systematic data to support the effectiveness of alprazolam for such use.&quot; The doctor noted, &quot;data on discontinuation from alprazolam in the Upjohn sponsored clinical trials were quite varied...even for controlled trials, seems to me that the design wasn&#39;t quite correct to answer the questions of interest.&quot; (i.e., withdrawal).</strong> He observed that even in the short-term treated patients, <strong>&quot;most experienced relapse (a recurrence of their symptoms) and a smaller fraction experienced rebound (a worsening relative to baseline of symptoms already present) or withdrawal (the development of new symptoms).&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Laughren added, <strong>&quot;we already know...many patients have difficulty stopping alprazolam, even with tapering; alprazolam withdrawal symptoms can occur even after low dose and short duration exposure; alprazolam withdrawal can be quite severe; and, at least some patients become tolerant to alprazolam and find it necessary to increase the dose...</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>This data suggest a strikingly higher risk of withdrawal phenomena for alprazolam doses greater than 4 mg/day compared to doses less than 4 mg/day.&quot;**</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Dr. Laughren&#39;s memo, application for XANAX in panic disorder have been <strong>turned down by Denmark (&quot;...insufficient data to evaluate long term efficacy and safety...&quot;), Germany, and Norway (&quot;...deficiency in long term data to support the safety of XANAX with regard to withdrawal phenomena...&quot;)</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Dr. Laughren indicated that there was strong support for the use of alprazolam &quot;in the short-term treatment of panic disorder. However, there are deficiencies in this application with regard to how best to use XANAX in treating panic disorder; in particular, there was not an adequate exploration of the dose/response relationship or for the duration of effect...<strong>there was no systematic attempt by the sponsor to address the issue of maintaining patients who had responded during short-term treatment...There was no systematic attempt to look at withdrawal schedules.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>On April 20, 1990, Dr. Leber wrote a memo to the Director of the Office of Drug Evaluation which said, <strong>&quot;...it seems likely that the use of XANAX at the doses needed to achieve an anti-panic effect will incidence untoward events substantially greater than that so far observed among patients treated for anxiety.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In discussing the issue of safety of XANAX, Dr. Leber wrote, &quot;The case is, in some ways, a close one...Also contributing to the difficulty of the judgment is the relative sparseness of the evidence...<strong>it could be argued that the sponsor has failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that XANAX will be &#39;safe in use&#39; under the conditions of use recommended.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>What do quotes from the new XANAX (Upjohn) product labeling reveal? &quot;Demonstrations of the effectiveness of XANAX by systematic <strong>clinical study are limited to four months</strong> duration for anxiety disorder and four to ten weeks duration for panic disorder.&quot; One may well wonder at the <strong>motive for not having longer-term scientific data available on a drug that has been aggressively marketed for a decade and that sells for over $800,000 per kilo.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Certain adverse clinical events, some life-threatening, are a direct consequence of physical dependence to XANAX. These include a spectrum of withdrawal symptoms; the most important is seizure... studies of patients with panic disorder showed a high rate of rebound and withdrawal symptoms with XANAX...symptoms of withdrawal; heightened sensor perception, impaired concentration, dysosmia, clouded sensorium, paresthesia, muscle cramps, muscle twitch, diarrhea, blurred vision, appetite decrease and weight loss.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Other symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, were frequently seen during discontinuation...The ability of patients to completely discontinue therapy with XANAX after long-term therapy has not been reliably determined...Withdrawal reactions may occur when dosage reduction occurs for any reason...<strong>withdrawal symptoms including seizures have been reported after only brief therapy with XANAX at doses within the recommended range for the treatment of anxiety (e.g., 0.75 to 4 mg/day)... seizure and death have been reported</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Death has been reported in association with overdoses of alprazolam itself...&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;XANAX has the potential to cause severe emotional and physical dependence in some patients and these patients may find it exceedingly difficult to terminate treatment...The following adverse events have been reported in association with the use of XANAX: seizures, hallucinations, depersonalization, taste alterations, diplopia, elevated bilirubin, elevated hepatic enzymes, and jaundice.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The necessary duration of treatment for panic disorder victims responding to XANAX is unknown...a carefully <strong>supervised tapered discontinuation may be attempted, but there is evidence that this may be difficult or impossible to accomplish</strong> without recurrence of symptoms and/or the manifestation of withdrawal phenomena.&quot;-</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Given the preponderance of evidence against approval, the vast majority of independent testimony given during the review recommend against approval citing too little data to support or the safety profile does not warrant approval</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The FDA panel voted and approval was won by one vote. Many of the panelists voting in favor were offered lucrative jobs at Upjohn immediately after approval. 2 of the decenting panelists resigned from the FDA claiming corruption, bribery and data manipulation</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><em>One panelists noted, A drug with unknown long-term consequences and potential for addiction has been approved by the FDA for a non-life-threatening condition, which may be treated successfully by non-drug means!-</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>XANAX has become a major economic success story for the Upjohn Company. <strong>Upjohn merger with Pharmacia of Sweden worth $16 Billion, then merger with Pfizer for $60 Billion.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<p>Small wonder with its habituating potential and immediate appeal for sufferers of panic and anxiety disorders desperately seeking relief. In the end, the long benzodiazepine tranquilizer voyage is a journey into the darkest side of the twilight zone - another world&#39;s timeless hell for those that are lured there seeking calm. And yet finding - unrelenting heightened anxiety and abject misery.</p>

<p>The people who would find themselves in a position to regulate these things would also have unfettered access to them. I feel like Western culture as a whole is benzo&#39;d out and not coming back. It&#39;s the worse than the opiate epidemic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Yes, Yes! The numbers are shocking. Over 6% of Americans are estimated to have a benzodiazepine addiction and 3% unrecoverable. This is worse than the opioid crisis, and has been overshadowed by it as well. My friend who is an ER trauma doc at Emory tells me it&#39;s so out of control that he may go into private practice b/c he can&#39;t handle another benzo seizure, and he has seen enough opioid overdoses than most (Atlanta...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see no logical reason that Xanax is prescribed so often for general anxiety and social anxiety. <a href="https://drugwiki.org/index.php?title=Benzodiazepine_Equivalency_Chart">Compare it</a> to diazepam, the traditional benzo:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Xanax goes to work in 15-30 minutes, diazepam takes an hour. This means that Xanax has a perceivable effect very quickly after taking a pill. This reinforces psychological addiction.</p></li>
<li><p>Xanax lasts only 3-4 hours, diazepam lasts 6, and the effects wear off less abruptly. More frequent administration means more psychological reinforcement and habit forming behavior.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For daily users, this means that Xanax is taken more often and the individual is more aware of the effects as they take place, in comparison to diazepam or clonazepam. This is a trait highly addictive drugs have: alcohol has an effect within half an hour and wears off relatively quickly, cocaine and heroin start working in under a minute and wear off after 30-60 minutes.</p>

<p>Benzos will be the next opiate crisis.</p>

<p>However, this does bring me to a funny story. Ratdog or The other ones I thought they were called - the dead sans JG... I was at their concert in LA - I have a small bowl with some weed but security is patrolling looking for offenders - i turn my back and duck to hit my bowl hiding from security- my shoulder length hair swings around and arrives at my lighter as I strike it - big spot of my hair goes up because of the shit I put in it - about 30 seconds later (if that) I hear someone a few rows back say “hey man! someones smokin hair!” (Read in a Cheech and Chong stoner voice) </p>
