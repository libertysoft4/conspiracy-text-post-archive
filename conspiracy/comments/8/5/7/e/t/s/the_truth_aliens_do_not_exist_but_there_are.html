        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The fallen angels are the enemies of mankind. I think they can change their appearance so as to appear human in form, but they lack our human emotions. Their goal is to destroy everyone who will not worship their master who we call Lucifer, Satan, the Devil. They are limited in their power and authority here, because the Earth belongs to human beings (the children of God) who were given a free will by God, so if we walk in righteousness and purity, they have no power over our lives. So the more twisted and perverted the world gets, the more energy they have to feed off, and the more power they have to create havoc and destruction.</p>

<p>Now this is where things get interesting. The Scriptures (Genesis 6:4) seems to teach that these angelic spiritual beings mated with human women and produced an offspring known as the nephilim. These were giants who lived on the Earth long ago, but they started to corrupt the Earth because they also lacked human emotions and morality, they turned to cannabilism and sexual perversion that is unimaginable. So their minds were twisted and they turned against each other, and they all fell by the sword as a punishment for the angels who knew they were doing something evil by having children. When they died, because they were neither human nor angel, they became evil spirits, at least according to the Book of Enoch. And so these evil spirits wander the Earth looking for people who are plagued by darkness and hatred, and they begin to oppress these people, which eventually leads to possession if the person they are attacking falls too far into the darkness. After a person is possessed, they lose entire control of their bodies for periods of time, similar to blacking out on alcohol, similar to mental conditions like multiple personality disorder, and this is when they commit great acts of violence against humans, following orders to kill and destroy God&#39;s creation. Sometimes it&#39;s not possession, but when the person kills themselves afterwards, that is almost a sure sign that they didn&#39;t have control of their bodies, since human nature tries to survive at all costs. Suicide is also often caused by severe oppression by evil spirits, the words of hatred that are being spoken in their minds are coming from these spirits, and they are telling people to do evil things to others.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what their plans are when it comes to some kind of alien invasion, but if something does happen, then know 100% that these are not some nice extraterrestrial creatures from another planet, they are spiritual beings coming from the spirit world and into our physical world, and they are not coming to save humanity, but to further enslave us and to drain us of our light and love. </p>

<p>If you want to stop them, then you have to harness the light within you by selflessly loving others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not up to or about medical science.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about evolution on an individual and collective level.  Medicine and science follow <em>that</em> - not the other way around.  Biblical times took place during the thick of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treta_Yuga">Treta Yuga</a> - which is the Yuga we are said to have <em>just</em> entered only a few short years ago.  Humans are indeed said to have a lifespan of ~1,000 years during the apex of this age.  We just left the worst, darkest time - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga">The Kali Yuga</a> where the lifespans max out at ~100.</p>

<p>It can be complicated, but <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Emfpzv5.png">here&#39;s this chart all the same.</a></p>

<p>Help me break free if you know how. I hate religion, but I love God. I am seeking the truth, but there is so much disinformation that has been poured into my mind since birth, it&#39;s hard to separate the truth from the lies, and there are so many lies, it almost feels like a hopeless endevour, but there is hope, I know it.</p>

<p>What you call &quot;angels&quot; and &quot;demons&quot; are simply identities that have varying degrees of &quot;service to others&quot; or &quot;service to self&quot; leanings.</p>

<p>ETs are the same.</p>

<p>Just like Earth humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not up to or about medical science.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about evolution on an individual and collective level.  Medicine and science follow <em>that</em> - not the other way around.  Biblical times took place during the thick of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treta_Yuga">Treta Yuga</a> - which is the Yuga we are said to have <em>just</em> entered only a few short years ago.  Humans are indeed said to have a lifespan of ~1,000 years during the apex of this age.  We just left the worst, darkest time - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga">The Kali Yuga</a> where the lifespans max out at ~100.</p>

<p>It can be complicated, but <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Emfpzv5.png">here&#39;s this chart all the same.</a></p>
