    <div class="md"><p>I clearly remember the story from Philip Wood breaking during the MH370 fiasco. Shills were coming out in the double trying to discredit it, I saw the original photo myself and within hours shills were spamming copies of it with altered data trying to muddy the waters. </p>

<p>And for it to be later confirmed that this Philip Wood was indeed on the plane was just that much more evidence. There was also a typo in the text due to him using speech to text. If it was a hoax it would&#39;ve been a very elaborate one that was created before the plane went missing, which is pretty unlikely unless the hoaxers had foreknowledge that the plane would go missing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ocean is a mysterious place no way in hell this is mh370 how can a plane float up on ruvers top after 3-4 years? Second regarding this messaging theory it&#39;s a troll a very good planned troll blackboxes don&#39;t have the technology of sending any message,it only records flight data and cockpit convo, and even after that it takes days for experts to extract the data out of it, do you really think the elite are a bunch of tards who&#39;d do this sort of thing and let the black box out there transmitting messages? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen those voice mail calls and it is 100% a hoax, black boxes are in no way built or even capable of sending out signals that can be picked up as phone calls around the world. </p>

<p>Also when you said &quot;how can a plane float up on ruvers top after 3-4 years?&quot; there is actually many accounts of downed aircraft being found hundreds or even thousands of miles from where the initial impact was in the water. Keep in mind that this isn&#39;t exactly a plane anymore, it has been completely picked piece by piece by massive ocean current. If what I say is correct the only thing they will find of the plane their is simply just a shell of a cockpit and body. </p>

<p>There has also been accounts of ships that have sunk in deep ocean being carried by ocean currents as well, in which they were washed up on shores or simply laid to rest on the ocean floor miles from where they &quot;sunk&quot;. Ocean currents are the sole reason as to why there are thousands of ships from WW2 that haven&#39;t been found, some that fought in the Coral Sea were being found thousands of miles south along the Australian coast. These ships weigh much more than a Boeing 777. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point, but it&#39;s doesn&#39;t explain how these two shapes cannot be seen at lots of different dates before 10/27/2014 and then remains in the water in the exact same shape and place for the next 4 years after this event.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, thoes parts of the plane surely would have sank beyond visibility a year plus later...... Sooner really. Almost instantly. You&#39;d not be able to see the plane from Ariel shots above. The water is not see-through all the way to the bottom. Also, once a vessel sinks and makes it&#39;s way to the ocean floor, currents don&#39;t much affect the debris, as the objects are too deep to be affected, therefore, they just lay there on the bottom of the ocean for eternity. Recall the Titanic site? The ship on the ocean floor has not moved much since it sank. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is hard to believe about this story is that so many major news agencies published it. I mean, it was just a photo of some thing from a satellite, and they even printed the amazing claims that it has bullet holes (i think impossible to tell) and things like “the cia is blocking efforts to find the plane” or whatever.
It just seems so amazing that this would get any news coverage at all, let along the relatively huge coverage it has gotten. (I am not saying at all his story is not true, just that the way it was published seems VERY unusual for the normally sceptical msm.) i think it shows how fallible the news sector is. Someone perhaps fell asleep at the wheel and everyone else just copied and pasted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point, but it&#39;s doesn&#39;t explain how these two shapes cannot be seen at lots of different dates before 10/27/2014 and then remains in the water in the exact same shape and place for the next 4 years after this event. To me it seems as though it can be what I believe it is or a huge coincidence that simply appeared just months after the MH370 disappeared. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understandable that it isn&#39;t the clearest of objects, however it would be a massive coincidence it forming the shape of a plane 10 months after MH370 disappeard and for it to keep that shape for the next 4 years.</p>
