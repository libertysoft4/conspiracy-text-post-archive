<p>What exactly did he reveal today in his press conference with Putin that was not already common knowledge?</p>

<p>He has systematically shit on his own intelligence agency numerous times, and denied anything at all to do with Russian collusion and praised Puntin in public and via his tweets.</p>

<p>He just came back from the G7 in Canada last week and shit on the Canadian PM while calling for Russia to be let back in.</p>

<p>He openly says he wants to dissolve NATO and called the EU a foe, I just can’t understand why people are so blown away by today’s news conference and the weekend in general.</p>

<p>What exactly did he say that was so jaw dropping that we have not heard or read from him before today?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the Nato meeting he told Germany to not buy natural gas from Russia. He even get other countries to invest more into Nato to make it stronger. How does that benefit Russia? We still have sanctione on Russia. Troops in Syria, and supplying arms for Ukraine. Those things all oppose Russia. Now Russia is the biggest nuclear threat on the planet so I see why he would attempt good relations with them. We don&#39;t need a nuclear war with them. There is a difference between getting along and being in their pocket.</p>

<p>His demands for more NATO funding obviously make NATO stronger. How come nobody is seeing that? This one&#39;s easy.</p>

<p>His relationship with Vladimir Putin is a little more difficult to get. Expect a double cross. There is no way that all those Republicans who have the power to remove Donald Trump from office sit by submissively while Trump buddies with Russia -- unless they know a double cross is coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What exactly was “shameful” about it.</p>

<p>At what point did he say something that he has not openly said before?</p>

<p>Have people not been listening to this president for the last two years, outraged that what, he said it in front of a world audience instead of just the nightly national american news or a tweet?</p>

<p>He openly admires Putin and Kim Jong-un, and thinks PM Trudeau is weak and the EU is the enemy.</p>

<p>I just dont understand why people are so surprised by this, he has been saying this type of thing since day one.</p>

<p>So today some type of revealation came to the masses, give me a break, if this is news to people they sure dont get out much.</p>

<p>With these 12 new indightments of Russian officials, our intelligence agencies are putting their money where their mouth is and Trump is choosing to undermine them and praise Putin instead.

    <div class="md"><p>Meh, the only issue here to me at least, is that the world media just shit themselves because Trump didnt change his tune at all...</p>

<p>The one reporter put him on the spot and asked to his face basically do you believe your own country&#39;s intelligence agency or the guy beside you that they are investigating in the first place.</p>

<p>His reply was the same thing he has said since day one, Putin told me he had nothing to do with it and i believe him, therefore my country’s intelligence agency is either lying or wrong.</p>

<p>Shit lets just put it in black and white, because Trump sure as hell has no problem saying it.</p>

<p>I as president of the united states take the word of a russian leader over my fellow american spy agencys.</p>

<p>Once again nothing new was revealed here in the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>those spy agencies who keep getting those wonderful toys from the MIC and paid for by the American taxpayers?, well, those who haven&#39;t shifted their finances to Panama or other wonderful tax havens. Those spy agencies who&#39;s unelected personel never change no matter who is in power? Those spy agencies whos members later go in to get golden parachutes into that same MIC? Those spy agencies would NEVER place their interests before those of their country for personal profit and lie... would they???</p>
