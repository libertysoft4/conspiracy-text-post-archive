<p>I&#39;ve always thought Mystery Babylon in Revelations was America. Lots of signs point to that. Inanna/Ishtar was known as the Whore of Babylon and Mother of Prostitutes because she supposedly started the practice of sacred prostitution. Inanna was the goddess of love, beauty, sex, desire, fertility, war, combat, justice, and political power.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_prostitution">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_prostitution</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sacred prostitution, temple prostitution, cult prostitution,[1] and religious prostitution are general terms for a sexual rite consisting of sexual intercourse or other sexual activity performed in the context of religious worship, perhaps as a form of fertility rite or divine marriage (hieros gamos). Some scholars prefer the term sacred sex to sacred prostitution in cases where payment for services was not involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But some scholars believe that this practice never existed and has been misunderstood.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The practice of sacred prostitution has not been substantiated in any Ancient Near Eastern cultures, despite many popular descriptions of the habit.[7] Through the twentieth century, scholars generally believed that a form of sacred marriage rite or hieros gamos was staged between the king of a Sumerian city-state and the High Priestess of Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of sexual love, fertility, and warfare, but no certain evidence has survived to prove that sexual intercourse was included. Along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers there was a temple of Eanna, meaning house of heaven[8] dedicated to Inanna in the Eanna District of Uruk.<br/>
This will be relevant in my next post about the source of Yahweh&#39;s narcissism but for now, I&#39;m just using this to illustrate part of the reason I think America is Babylon.</p>

<p>The Statue of Liberty is a representation of the Roman goddess Libertas. Which is a goddess that derived from many other goddesses: Inanna, Ishtar, Isis, Aphrodite, Venus, etc. Ultimately this goddess was transformed in a personification of America and liberty called Columbia. And just like Inanna, is it any wonder America seems to have 2 split sides to it? One side that is sexually repressed and all about virtue. And another that is obsessed with sex, violence, war  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_(name">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_(name</a>)  </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the fact that the way Babylon is described sounds a lot like America. Getting the whole world drunk on our luxuries and riches, being arrogant and being fools who know nothing. This sounds like America too.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sumerians worshipped Inanna as the goddess of both warfare and sexuality. Unlike other gods, whose roles were static and whose domains were limited, the stories of Inanna describe her as moving from conquest to conquest. She was portrayed as young and impetuous, constantly striving for more power than she had been allotted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inanna also was depicted as riding a Lion and she associated with the planet Venus. </p>

<p>Regulus is a part of the constellation Leo and considered &quot;the heart of the lion&quot;. Considering Regulus is a very important star in Trump&#39;s birth chart apparently, and that star was known as The King in Babylon (known as the little king as well in other places), that would make Trump the King of Babylon.  </p>

<p>In 2014, Regulus was eclipsed by an asteroid for 14 seconds right over New York.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nymetroweather.com/tag/regulus/">https://www.nymetroweather.com/tag/regulus/</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>An asteroid will pass directly in front of Regulus, one of the brightest stars in our night sky, next Wednesday — briefly blacking out the star in what astronomers are calling a “once in a lifetime” event. Better yet, New York City falls directly within the viewing path which is literally paper-thin on the earths scale. The event is so small, and so brief, that it will only be visible over a sliver of area. And this area happens to encompass millions of people in New York City, Northeast NJ and Long Island.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Thursday, March 20 2014, Regulus will participate in a rare celestial event when an asteroid passes directly in front of the star, as seen from Earth. The asteroid in question is 163 Erigone. Asteroid 163 Erigone is about 45 miles (72 km) wide, but its &quot;shadow&quot; slanting to Earth&#39;s surface will be 67 miles (108 km) wide.  </p>

<p>Erigone&#39;s shadow will move on a southeast-to-northwest trajectory and will extend from New York City as well as western and central Long Island to Oswego in New York State, and then continues northwest, the length of Ontario to the Hudson Bay shore of Manitoba. Those who are within the shadow path and watching at just the right moment with just their eyes will see an amazing sight: Regulus will seem to abruptly disappear as if a switch had been thrown, blotted out by the tiny invisible asteroid.  </p>

<p>Regulus will remain invisible for up to 14 seconds (for those situated along the center of the path); an incredible, albeit very brief occurrence.</p>

<p>This &quot;once in a lifetime event&quot; eclipsing right over New York. Where the Statue of Liberty is.</p>

<p><strong>Revelations 17</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. 4 The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries. 5 The name written on her forehead was a mystery:  </p>

<p>15 Then the angel said to me, “The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages. 16 The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire. 17 For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to hand over to the beast their royal authority, until God’s words are fulfilled. 18 The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>America&#39;s colors are red, white and blue. Red+Blue = Purple. Purple apparently represents royalty as well as vanity. Scarlet represents the blood of Christ and martyrs.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The color purple is also associated with royalty in Christianity, being one of the three traditional offices of Jesus Christ, i. e. king, although such a symbolism was assumed from the earlier Roman association or at least also employed by the ancient Romans.</p>

<p>In Europe and America, purple is the color most associated with vanity, extravagance, and individualism. Among the seven major sins, it represents vanity. It is a color which is used to attract attention</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_(color">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_(color</a>)  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Roman Catholic Church, scarlet is the color worn by a cardinal, and is associated with the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs, and with sacrifice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to this, the creator wanted the Statue of Liberty to be covered in gold.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and was glittering with gold  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>8.Bartholdi planned for the statue to be covered in gold.</strong><br/>
In order to make the statue visible after dark, Bartholdi proposed that Americans raise the money to gild her. However, given how daunting and arduous a task it had been to gather even enough money to place the statue in New York harbor, no one followed through on paying the enormous cost of covering the massive statue in gold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to mention this little interesting fact that brings the 2nd Beasts actions that are spoken of to mind.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>:<br/>
The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.</p>

<p>:<br/>
<strong>9. Thomas Edison once had plans to make the statue talk.</strong><br/>
When Edison introduced the phonograph to the public in 1878, he told the newspapers that he was designing a “monster disc” for the interior of the Statue of Liberty that would allow the statue to deliver speeches that could be heard up to the northern part of Manhattan and across the bay. Thankfully, no one pursued that strange promise, which would have led to the odd experience of walking in New York and suddenly hearing the Statue of Liberty “talking.”</p>

<p>precious stones and pearls.</p>

<p>There are 25 windows in the crown which symbolize gemstones found on the earth and the heaven’s rays shining over the world. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi designed the statue to be fully illuminated, a feature that’s suggested in its official name, “La Liberté Eclairant le Monde,” or “Liberty Enlightening the World.” (At first the Statue of Liberty doubled as a lighthouse, given its position in the New York Harbor, but that didn’t last: It was decommissioned as such in 1902.)  </p>

<p>Originally the lighting scheme was to be red, white, and blue—with a giant searchlight trained on the statue’s face and shoulders. Officials claimed in 19th-century newspaper accounts that they would make the statue so bright as to cast a glow on the clouds of the night sky 100 miles away. The statue’s face was to be lit by a reflector so bright that newspapers described it as “4 million candle power.” Her diadem was meant to sparkle with electric light. These were lofty goals in the dawn of the electrical age, and they carried symbolism that has lost much of its potency now that electricity is taken for granted. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the torch, the flames are covered in gold. Looks enough like a cup. Also, in Isaiah 14:12 (another prophecy detailing the fall of Babylon that I didn&#39;t bother copying and pasting all of here) it refers to Babylon (or it&#39;s king) as &quot;Lucifer, son of the morning&quot;. Lucifer means &quot;light bringer&quot; (hence the torch and the statue&#39;s original name being Liberty Enlightening the World) or &quot;morning star&quot; which is another name for the planet Venus which is associated with Inanna/Ishtar.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!</p>

<p>Notice how that star shape has 11 points? Seems like a strange number.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire. 17 For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to hand over to the beast their royal authority</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 10 kings + the beast = 11.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits. They are also seven kings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has 7 spikes coming out of the head. </p>

<p><a href="https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/01_00240318.jpg?quality=85">https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/01_00240318.jpg?quality=85</a></p>

<p>We&#39;re a very diverse country and Lady Liberty represents us taking in people from all countries. We pretty much control the world (for now) as the 7 hills represents the 7 continents, which is literally what is said they represent. Plus she&#39;s literally sitting on an island in the water.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then the angel said to me, “The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The creator of the Statue of Liberty,  Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, was a Freemason and they placed this plaque at the base of the statue.</p>

<p><a href="https://untappedcities-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/iyftc1oqf704bytwz45ub151.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Statue-of-Liberty-Freemason-Cornerstone-NYC.jpg">https://untappedcities-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/iyftc1oqf704bytwz45ub151.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Statue-of-Liberty-Freemason-Cornerstone-NYC.jpg</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Masonic theories abound about the Statue of Liberty’s connection to the masons. Those who do ascribe to the theory cite Bartholdi’s and Eiffel’s membership in the Freemasons, that many original plans for the statue demonstrate the link and that many elements of the statue carry symbolic meaning.  </p>

<p>In addition, the masons presided over the cornerstone laying for the Statue of Liberty, a moment commemorated in a 1984 plaque in dedication to the masons on the 100th anniversary. In 1884, the grand master William A. Brodie laid the cornerstone with grand lodge members present. Brodie is reported to have said, “Why call upon the Masonic Fraternity to lay the cornerstone of such a structure as is here to be erected? No institution has done more to promote liberty and to free men from the trammels and chains of ignorance and tyranny than has Freemasonry.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then there&#39;s the poem that is inside the base.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The New Colossus</strong>  </p>

<p>Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,<br/>
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;<br/>
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand<br/>
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame<br/>
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name<br/>
MOTHER OF EXILES. From her beacon-hand<br/>
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command<br/>
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.  </p>

<p>&quot;Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!&quot; cries she<br/>
With silent lips. &quot;Give me your tired, your poor,<br/>
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,<br/>
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.<br/>
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,<br/>
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Mother of exiles.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>45 “Come out of her, my people!<br/>
Run for your lives!<br/>
Run from the fierce anger of the Lord.<br/>
46 Do not lose heart or be afraid<br/>
when rumors are heard in the land;<br/>
one rumor comes this year, another the next,<br/>
rumors of violence in the land<br/>
and of ruler against ruler.<br/>
47 For the time will surely come<br/>
when I will punish the idols of Babylon;<br/>
her whole land will be disgraced</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, we&#39;re definitely hearing of rumors of violence here in America and if there aren&#39;t rumors of ruler against ruler, we&#39;re going hear them soon.</p>

<p>Here are links to the rest of the ophrosy  forces.  </p>

<p>With the eclipse of Regulus in 2014 for 14 seconds right over New York. I think they might get hit with something major. Maybe a hurricane. This season is suppose to be bad and FEMA is saying they are completely unprepared. I&#39;m sure that wasn&#39;t on purpose or anything. I think maybe a big earthquake might happen soon too in the next month. Seeing a lot of weird shit. A lot of polarity with the planets and asteroids. I think it&#39;s all connected to our polarity as the Trump Delusion continues. You seeing these reports and videos of these racist people just saying mean shit to people all over the place now for no reason? They&#39;re lashing out because they&#39;re scared their delusion bubble might burst so they&#39;re acting out. It&#39;s only going to escalate until both sides completely lose their fucking minds. </p>

<p><strong>Welcome to General Election 2016 – The Transition</strong>  </p>

<p>The Hegelian Dialectic is the transition of things. And the Illuminati loves to use it. We have been expecting it.  </p>

<p>We have read about it. And now it is here, in front of our faces. And many are IGNORING it.  </p>

<p>Folks, we are witnessing Hegelian logic on display.  </p>

<p>How we got here is an aside, but here we are. The disease is Hillary, and the medicine is Trump. For most folks, that’s all that matters. Case closed. What most citizens do not realize is that this is all a ruse. A mirage.  </p>

<p>It is being carried by, “they.”  </p>

<p>“They” are using the illusion, because America was stationary and stubborn.  </p>

<p>“You can’t New World Order me!” Americans said, “…Because we know about you.”  </p>

<p>Did the globalists go away and cry in their beer? Nope. They knew this would happen. It was expected. But<br/>
some of the citizens heard a few radio shows that told them, “we’re gonna win.”  </p>

<p>Hegel’s dialectic utilizes the “mirage.” And then steers the people through its house of mirrors with scary monsters. In America’s case, the monster is a short woman with a trucker’s voice named Hillary. Their task is simple. Globalism. But how do they get there?  </p>

<p>Simple:  </p>

<p>Scare them with the Thesis – Hillary / the Enemy of Freedom.  </p>

<p>And offset her with the Anti-thesis – Donald the Lion-Hearted / Champion of the People.  </p>

<p>…Next stop – the Synthesis. Ashes with a rising phoenix.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s right there in front of us. Do you see it folks?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is also known as  </p>

<p>Problem &gt; Reaction &gt; Solution  </p>

<p>Ultimately this is leading to:  </p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Trump vs Deep State  </p>

<p><strong>Reaction:</strong> Global Disaster  </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> One world government and one world currency  </p>

<p>They say this is a double headed eagle, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s a double headed Phoenix. And it&#39;s the symbol of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonary.  </p>

<p><a href="http://uscnjpha.org/history/double-headed-eagle/">http://uscnjpha.org/history/double-headed-eagle/</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Double Headed Eagle of Lagash” is the oldest Royal Crest in the World… No emblematic device of today can boast of such antiquity. Its origin has been traced to the ancient city of Lagash. It was in use a thousand years before the Exodus from Egypt and more than two thousand years before the building of “King Solomon’s Temple.”  </p>

<p>“As time rolled on, it passed from the Sumerians to the men of Akkad, from the men of Akkad to the Hittites, from the denizens of Asia Minor to the Seljukian Sultans from whom it was brought by the Crusaders to the Emperors of the East and West, whose successors were the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs.”  </p>

<p>“In recent excavations, the city-emblem of Lagash was disclosed also as a lion headed eagle sinking his claws into the bodies of two lions standing back to back. This is evidently a variant of the other eagle symbol”.  </p>

<p>“The city of Lagash is in Sumer in Southern Babylonia, between the Euphrates and the Tigris and near the modern Shatra in Iraq, Lagash had a calendar of twelve lunar months, a system of weights and measures, a banking and accounting system and was a center of art, literature, military and political power, five thousand years before Christ”.  </p>

<p>“In 102 B.C. the Roman Consul Marius decreed that the Eagle be displayed as a symbol of Imperial Rome. Later, as a world power, Rome used the Double-Headed Eagle, one head facing the East the other facing the West, symbolizing the universality and unity of the Empire. The Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire continued its use and the symbol was adopted later in Germany during the halcyon days of conquest and imperial power”.  </p>

<p>So far as is known, the Double-Headed Eagle was first used in Freemasonry in 1758 by a Masonic Body in Paris – the Emperors of the East and West. During a brief period the Masonic Emperors of the East and West controlled the advanced degrees then in use and became a precursor of the “Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite”.  </p>

<p>The Latin caption under the Double-Headed Eagle – “Spes Mea in Deo Est” translated is “My Hope Is In God”.</p>

<p>A part of this sounds familiar  </p>

Later, as a world power, Rome used the Double-Headed Eagle, one head facing the East the other facing the West, symbolizing the universality and unity of the Empire. The Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire continued its use and the symbol was adopted later in Germany during the halcyon days of conquest and imperial power”.  </p>

<p>So far as is known, the Double-Headed Eagle was first used in Freemasonry in 1758 by a Masonic Body in Paris – the Emperors of the East and West. During a brief period the Masonic Emperors of the East and West controlled the advanced degrees then in use and became a precursor of the “Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it represented the universality and unity of the Empire of Rome and was later adopted by Germany during their days of conquest and imperial power. For these Freemasons, it represents two emperors, one from the east and one from the west coming together to create one empire. Hmm.. I wonder if that has any significance to today&#39;s world. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The imperial bird with two heads simultaneously facing East and West has been Russia’s official coat of arms for centuries, with only a break during the Soviet era. The emblem, however, is far older than the country, with roots dating to ancient civilizations.  </p>

<p>An eagle on a country’s coat of arms is quite common – this bird is as popular a national symbol as the lion. “He is the king of birds; just like the lion is believed to rule all animals, and he is associated with the cult of the sun,” Georgy Vilinbakhov, head of Russia’s Heraldic Council, explains. </p>

<p>So Trump&#39;s new coat of arms has the same symbol as Russia which symbolizes 2 empires, one from the east and one from the west, combining into one.</p>

<p>Does the way they dress look familiar to anyone? </p>

<h1>The New Roman Empire / Fourth Reich &amp; The Rise of The Phoenix and One World Currency</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Title of article: Get Ready for the Phoenix</strong>   </p>

<p>THIRTY years from now, Americans, Japanese, Europeans, and people in many other rich countries, and some relatively poor ones will probably be paying for their shopping with the same currency. Prices will be quoted not in dollars, yen or D-marks but in, let’s say, the phoenix. The phoenix will be favoured by companies and shoppers because it will be more convenient than today’s national currencies, which by then will seem a quaint cause of much disruption to economic life in the last twentieth century.<br/>
–<br/>
At the beginning of 1988 this appears an outlandish prediction. Proposals for eventual monetary union proliferated five and ten years ago, but they hardly envisaged the setbacks of 1987. The governments of the big economies tried to move an inch or two towards a more managed system of exchange rates – a logical preliminary, it might seem, to radical monetary reform. For lack of co-operation in their underlying economic policies they bungled it horribly, and provoked the rise in interest rates that brought on the stock market crash of October. These events have chastened exchange-rate reformers. The market crash taught them that the pretence of policy co-operation can be worse than nothing, and that until real co-operation is feasible (i.e., until governments surrender some economic sovereignty) further attempts to peg currencies will flounder.<br/>
…<br/>
The new world economy<br/>
The biggest change in the world economy since the early 1970’s is that flows of money have replaced trade in goods as the force that drives exchange rates. as a result of the relentless integration of the world’s financial markets, differences in national economic policies can disturb interest rates (or expectations of future interest rates) only slightly, yet still call forth huge transfers of financial assets from one country to another. These transfers swamp the flow of trade revenues in their effect on the demand and supply for different currencies, and hence in their effect on exchange rates. As telecommunications technology continues to advance, these transactions will be cheaper and faster still. With unco-ordinated economic policies, currencies can get only more volatile.<br/>
….<br/>
In all these ways national economic boundaries are slowly dissolving. As the trend continues, the appeal of a currency union across at least the main industrial countries will seem irresistible to everybody except foreign-exchange traders and governments. In the phoenix zone, economic adjustment to shifts in relative prices would happen smoothly and automatically, rather as it does today between different regions within large economies (a brief on pages 74-75 explains how.) The absence of all currency risk would spur trade, investment and employment.<br/>
–<br/>
The phoenix zone would impose tight constraints on national governments. There would be no such thing, for instance, as a national monetary policy. The world phoenix supply would be fixed by a new central bank, descended perhaps from the IMF. The world inflation rate – and hence, within narrow margins, each national inflation rate- would be in its charge. Each country could use taxes and public spending to offset temporary falls in demand, but it would have to borrow rather than print money to finance its budget deficit. With no recourse to the inflation tax, governments and their creditors would be forced to judge their borrowing and lending plans more carefully than they do today. This means a big loss of economic sovereignty, but the trends that make the phoenix so appealing are taking that sovereignty away in any case. Even in a world of more-or-less floating exchange rates, individual governments have seen their policy independence checked by an unfriendly outside world.<br/>
–<br/>
As the next century approaches, the natural forces that are pushing the world towards economic integration will offer governments a broad choice. They can go with the flow, or they can build barricades. Preparing the way for the phoenix will mean fewer pretended agreements on policy and more real ones. It will mean allowing and then actively promoting the private-sector use of an international money alongside existing national monies. That would let people vote with their wallets for the eventual move to full currency union. The phoenix would probably start as a cocktail of national currencies, just as the Special Drawing Right is today. In time, though, its value against national currencies would cease to matter, because people would choose it for its convenience and the stability of its purchasing power.<br/>
…..<br/>
The alternative – to preserve policymaking autonomy- would involve a new proliferation of truly draconian controls on trade and capital flows. This course offers governments a splendid time. They could manage exchange-rate movements, deploy monetary and fiscal policy without inhibition, and tackle the resulting bursts of inflation with prices and incomes polices. It is a growth-crippling prospect. Pencil in the phoenix for around 2018, and welcome it when it comes. </p>

<p>So it was a random Sunday: bed, eat, repeat until I went online and I saw a link by a new user called @limon. There was a small introduction to a YouTube video which at first glance didn’t look interesting, but what the hell? Lets read this.  </p>

<p><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*elDj86VJw2L6lLpi-xYDCw.png">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/...lLpi-xYDCw.png</a>  </p>

<p>He talked about an article from The Economist, year 1988, coin, phoenix and then Zoin… wtf?  </p>

<p>Anyways, I opened the link (don’t open links from strangers) and watched the video in Youtube, (it’s in Spanish)  </p>

<p>@limon claims in the video (minute 5) that he actually found a not so well know cryptocurrency (yet) by doing some research on an article from 1988 and he is somehow convinced it’s going to be huge. Yes, @limon saw the writing and thought maybe I should check this and find out which is the coin of the future.  </p>

<p>As crazy as it seems, finding a cryptocurrency by doing research on a 1988 magazine its quite incredible. Is it a coincidence or is it a prediction? Not even @limon knows, but there’s a few things that can blow up your mind here.  </p>

<p>This is the article from 1988. It claims that there will be a currency (referred as “phoenix”) that will be used by everybody in several countries in 2018.  </p>

<p>So yes, you all might say “the coin is called the Phoenix”. There’s actually a coin called Phoenixcoin but that didn’t seem to convince @limon once he checked it out in <a href="http://www.coinmarketcap.com/">www.coinmarketcap.com</a> (it sucked even for @limon who wanted to believe with all his heart)  </p>

<p>But @limon didn’t give up, he thought what if its hidden? So he decided to take a closer look at the magazine cover.  </p>

<p><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EG4S4S_rEqB2LKufsoJVug.png">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/...LKufsoJVug.png</a>  </p>

<p>He noticed that he could read the letters backward (um…interesting)  </p>

<p><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rpByLmseFlwRIr1KSVOMbw.png">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/...Ir1KSVOMbw.png</a>  </p>

<p>He got XIN3ONd NET by reading the cover letter backwards and he said well, XIN is Chinese, and found out in google translator that XIN meant NEW.  </p>

<p>Then 3ONd he looked at it and thought this is Russian… and it was. That weird word that would not mean anything to someone meant something for @limon so he decided to google translate it.  </p>

<p><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bHTMmYx_Xq2Xuui5nS3hFg.png">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/...uui5nS3hFg.png</a>  </p>

<p>Well yeah 3ONd is Russian and means ZOI, but wait is this a coin? @Limon decided to search “ZOI” in <a href="http://www.coinmarketcap.com/">www.coinmarketcap.com</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KMokvjDAoCUPLN2UCCLQwg.png">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/...LN2UCCLQwg.png</a>  </p>

<p>WOW, Zoin existed. He ended up with the sentence NEW ZOI NET, in which Zoi was an actual currency.  </p>

<p>He starting searching now all about Zoin (DYOR) and liked everything he saw. The team, the community and development its very much updated.  </p>

<p>Got even more carried away when he saw Zoin’s logo:  </p>

<p><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3WPv0EQ81mDX4CV6Ln5sFQ.png">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/...4CV6Ln5sFQ.png</a>  </p>

<p><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XeYYMlOjlgUpy75KEGoyHQ.png">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/...y75KEGoyHQ.png</a>  </p>

<p>And when he researched even deeper, he found out that ZOIN was left by its first developer and got taken over by its community from all over the world.  </p>

<p>Yes, Zoin emerged from the ashes. What? wait. Zoin is also a Phoenix.  </p>

<p>Anyways, @limon found all the signs of a prophecy from 1988.  </p>

<p>He couldn’t wait so he joined Zoin’s community and shared his video.  </p>

<p>By the way he bought some Zoin. After finding the last lost prophecy he had no plans on missing out.  </p>

<p>Check all about Zoin in the following links.  </p>

<p>You can reach out to the team on Discord, website address is <a href="http://www.zoinofficial.com/">www.zoinofficial.com</a> and their twitter @zoinofficial  </p>

<p>You better don’t miss it. Its a prophecy.  </p>

<p>Thank you limon.  </p>

<p>Notice the year on the coin and at the end of the article, 2018. &quot;Pencil in the phoenix for around 2018, and welcome it when it comes&quot;. Trump and Russia both have a double headed Phoenix signifying the union of an Empire. This article talks about a one world currency called &quot;Phoenix&quot; coming in 2018. The number 10 upside down is 01. It&#39;s a bit on a coin</p>

<p>I posted about an Israeli company that can do things with blockchain and DNA  in my previous postings on this topic. I think that this will have something to do with the Mark of the Beast.</p>

<h1>Trump is the Tip of the Spear for the NWO Plan</h1>

<p>Notice the spear tip coming out of the Phoenix&#39;s head? Trump. has a spear on top of both of his coat of arm. Trump is the tip of the sphere. I think once he&#39;s fulfilled his purpose in wrecking everything and nuking North Korea, I think they might have someone take him out. Then things would get even crazier.</p>

What do you think all that secret knowledge they have in those libraries? Both Jesus and Lucifer are called the &quot;morning star&quot;. Both are bringers of light and wisdom. Jesus brought truth and love. Lucifer isnt even a person or entity in the Bible. The term &quot;lucifer&quot; i&#39;s only mentioned one time in reference to Babylon being destroyed.

<p>The translation of הֵילֵל as &quot;Lucifer&quot;, as in the King James Version, has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations render הֵילֵל as &quot;morning star&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_International_Version">New International Version</a>, New Century Version, New American Standard Bible, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_News_Bible">Good News Translation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holman_Christian_Standard_Bible">Holman Christian Standard Bible</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_English_Version">Contemporary English Version</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_English_Bible">Common English Bible</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messianic_Bible_translations">Complete Jewish Bible</a>), &quot;daystar&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jerusalem_Bible">New Jerusalem Bible</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Message_(Bible">The Message</a>)), &quot;Day Star&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Revised_Standard_Version">New Revised Standard Version</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Standard_Version">English Standard Version</a>), &quot;shining one&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Version">New Life Version</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Translation_of_the_Holy_Scriptures">New World Translation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPS_Tanakh">JPS Tanakh</a>), or &quot;shining star&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Living_Translation">New Living Translation</a>).  </p>

<p>The term appears in the context of an oracle against a dead king of Babylon,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer#cite_note-Eerdmans-29">[29]</a> who is addressed as הילל בן שחר (<em>Hêlêl ben Šāḥar</em>),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer#cite_note-30">[30]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer#cite_note-31">[31]</a> rendered in the King James Version as &quot;O Lucifer, son of the morning!&quot; and in others as &quot;morning star, son of the dawn&quot;.  </p>

<p>In a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase &quot;Lucifer&quot; or &quot;morning star&quot; occurs begins with the statement: &quot;On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer#cite_note-32">[32]</a> After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:  </p>

<p>&quot;How you have fallen from heaven, <em>morning star</em>, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, &#39;I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Aqraa">Mount Zaphon</a>. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.&#39; But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: &#39;Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?&#39;&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer#cite_note-33">[33]</a>  </p>

<p>J. Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted, the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man; and that man may have been not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar_II">Nebuchadnezzar II</a>, but rather his son, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belshazzar">Belshazzar</a>.

<p>As you can see, he is referring to a man, not a God, or an angel. Using the name as a metaphor. The brightest star in the sky falling from the heavens because he became too arrogant.  The Latin word corresponding to Greek Phosphorus is “Lucifer”. It has nothing to do with Satan if you strictly go off of the Bible and not what you&#39;ve been told. This is from the Old Testament too and the Jews don&#39;t even believe in a demon named Satan. Satan just means adversary or accuser. It&#39;s not one being compassion all evil like he is according to Christians. Plus, Lucifer means &quot;light bringer&quot;. Satan is the father of lies. He doesn&#39;t bring you real truth or wisdom. He tricks you. Then there&#39;s the fact that Jesus calls himself the morning star in the book of Revelations. So both Satan and Jesus are the morning star? No, Jesus is the light bringer. Lucifer is a made up concept in Christianity. The people who practice Luciferianism are being tricked into thinking that Lucifer = Jesus and Lucifer = Satan, so Satan = Good. Only the first part could be considered true, if Lucifer was even a real entity in the Bible.</p>

This entire post should just be discarded because it&#39;s just misinfo.  Learned Jews are very aware of Satan, which is called HaSatan in Hebrew (wow yes it&#39;s originally a Hebrew word).  He has several names including the Yeter Hara (evil inclination), the angel of death etc....He&#39;s not a demon.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Get better sources.  Don&#39;t assume things you don&#39;t know about the people that received the only Torah/Bible from G-d Himself in a mass national revelation.  Otherwise you are literally empower Satan with your own actions and slander.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is the little horn, the King of Babylon and the Antichrist. If you read my other threads you can see the Universe telling us this in the 3 books and TV show what Trump is. &quot;The little Baron Trump&quot;, &quot;The Last President&quot;, and &quot;The High Priest of Fraud&quot;. It&#39;s all spelled out for you in those books and the TV show.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/baron">https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/baron</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>baron</strong>   </p>

<p>A baron is a nobleman — a member of the aristocracy. Barons are also important, powerful businessmen with huge influence over their industries. In &gt;Britain, a baron is called “Lord,” but in the States, we call them “rich.”<br/>
Barons are members of the aristocracy — wealthy people born into power and influence. How high a baron ranks depends on the country, but the title &gt;always carries respect. Similarly, a business leader who is rich, powerful, and influential is a baron. The term is used in phrases such as oil baron and baron &gt;of industry. You can also call that kind of baron a big businessman, magnate, mogul, top executive, or tycoon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Horns are always representations of people in power. The Baron title has both significance to Trump&#39;s Scottish heritage and his business persona. The little Baron Trump = The little horn Trump</p>

BABYLON - Doctrines derived from ancient Babylon, including observing the birthday of the reincarnated King Nimrod on December 25th, planting trees in one&#39;s home and giving gifts. Also Easter = Ishtar, Nimrod&#39;s mother/wife
THE GREAT - Perhaps the largest religion ever
THE MOTHER - The &quot;mother church&quot; is what Catholicism is called since it had many, many offshoots which believe many similar things and tend to disagree on only a few points of doctrine. Also, there is a belief among the Vatican that many of the flock will one day return to their &quot;parent&quot;. Finally, it could also refer to the &quot;cult of Mary&quot;.
OF THE WHORES - There is a kind of prostitution involved-- historically the selling of indulgences was prominent. Today we have bingo and carnivals.
AND ABOMINATIONS - Probably a reference to &quot;The abomination that makes desolate&quot;. Literally the world is become a desolation and is bereft of true spiritual knowledge because of preaching the person of Jesus instead of his message.

<p>The parent is Sophia. The real mother goddess. Yahweh is a crazy narcissist with extreme mother issues which is why we got separated from our mother (Garden of Eden/nature) and all women were cursed to be subservient to men. This is where the push to destroy the Earth and pursue technology to the point where we make ourselves extinct. Separating us further and further from nature, the cosmos, each other and even God. The first step of which was the Neolithic Revolution. The Bible even says it&#39;s a curse to work the land with the sweat of your brow. That one change in human lifestyle, is the ONLY reason we are where we are when it comes to the evil and division in this world. Can&#39;t create giant governments to control people from hunter/gatherers.</p>

<p>When Yahweh calls someone a whore, he means worshiping another God.Israel is suppose to be his bride. It&#39;s like they&#39;re cheating on him and he&#39;s super jealous. Like the most psychotic ex boyfriend ever, Even creates these elaborate scenarios just so he can rescue you from them and then hold it over your head for the rest of your life to manipulate you to get you to do what he wants you to do. *cough*Exodus*cough*</p>

<p>Abomination is just anything Yahweh doesn&#39;t like and Satan is the God of this world. Always has been. I&#39;d be wary of anyone who shows up acting like they&#39;re going to save us, especially aliens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I literally laid out my entire case for you. It&#39;s all there. If you don&#39;t think he is, then at least attempt to refute my evidence because simply stating your opinion doesn&#39;t mean anything in the face of overwhelming facts.</p>

<p>Here. Listen to these two Hitler sympathizers and see if you see any similarities to then  and now with their arguments.</p>

<p>It starts out with Roger Stone giving a defense to McCarthyism (after the Bill Cosby remark) because the threat from Russia infiltrating and influencing our country was real. And then it switches to a Hitler sympathizer talking about how Hitler wasn&#39;t really a bad guy and he was trying to free his country from the worldwide banking institutions and make Germany great again. (No he didn&#39;t really say that)</p>

<p><strong>From the Youtube description:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Short excerpts from an appearance by Roger Stone on Henrik Palmgren&#39;s Red Ice Radio broadcast, where he justifies Nixon&#39;s anti-dissident program on the basis that there was a real threat of a communist takeover at the time. Stone is a long-time Republican operative, who worked on the election campaigns of Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush in 2000, and managed Gary Johnson&#39;s campaign on the Libertarian party ticket in 2012.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoAb2d3SKzM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoAb2d3SKzM</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Let me ask you a little more about the detente and what happened with Soviet and US relations around this period and how you view Soviet infiltration of American politics and how real that is. Just like this Nixon view that people have [about his anti-dissident CIA operations], they view McCarthyism as you&#39;re a crazy kook that&#39;s just running around paranoid and there&#39;s nothing to it. Was there a real threat at the time from Soviet infiltration and were they smart to be paranoid about all of this do you think?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Roger Stone:</strong> I do think that there was a legitimate threat of domestic communism and subversion in the this country. I think that McCarthy was on to something. His tactics were sloppy. There&#39;s no question. But it&#39;s hard to come up with a name of all these people he ruined. Name one. You can&#39;t. There isn&#39;t one.  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Yeah and even what went around in Hollywood at the time. What happened there with the infiltration and plenty of people at the time were being sentenced for being communist spies. Yet in hindsight now, in history, people repeat that footage of McCarthy and kind of laugh at it like there&#39;s nothing to it. It&#39;s a very one sided view of history.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Roger Stone:</strong> &quot;Well the Soviets were smart enough to understand the power of movies. The power of communications and they used infiltration of the unions, the electricians union, the stagehands union, the theatrical unions to try to have an effect on the studios. And to try to get movies that showed a more benign and friendly view of the Soviet Union. This is all historically documented. The idea that Ronald Reagan was some king of lunatic because he was trying to ferret out communist subversion in the motion picture industry in the 40s and 50s is nonsense. Reagan was correct. There was a concerted effort to try to make inroads into the control of mass media at the time.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a mere 4 years ago. When the Republicans remembered that the Russians were our enemies and were always going to be our enemies for the foreseeable future. When they remembered that infiltrating our country by covert means and subverting our democracy was their MO. All of a sudden they pretend like they never believed that and anyone who does is just a silly conspiracy theorist. What exactly changed in the span of 2 years to make them do a complete 180 and deny the reality of their previous positions? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the conversation with a Hitler sympathizer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;You had a kind of world in Berlin that was filled with debauchery, promiscuity and prostitution. It was kind of a cesspool of immortality with all the drugs and everything else. It was something that was spread all over Germany. Do you believe that was a tactic to break down the German people? Where did all these influences come from and why did this center in Berlin?  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;Well I think it&#39;s a tactic that&#39;s going on today. Certainly in Berlin at the time was the center of debauchery in Europe. People would come from all over Europe because it was so cheap. Ten American dollars could buy you anything. Anything in the perverted sex world. Pedophilia, child prostitution, bestiality. You name it. Berlin was the center of it all. Homosexuality, it was a haven. Munich was more of a national socialist right wing type of center. Where Berlin was left wing., more communist. Certainly Hitler said this. &quot;As soon as I come to power, whats going on in Berlin, I will stop&quot;. And he did and this kind of drove a lot of people out. Mainly the Jewish people, the nightclub owners, etc. Actors and actresses who left for America. And if you want a comparison today, I suppose Hollywood is the place you&#39;d compare it to. Where Satanism, drugs, prostitution, debauchery goes on in that place. And Hitler was against all that. He cleaned up Berlin and eventually cleaned up Germany. To the point where families could walk the streets of Berlin. Before it wasn&#39;t safe. These are not actions of an evil man. This is a man who loves his country and loves the people in his country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>SEGMENT TWO: JUDEA DECLARES WAR ON GERMANY</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;He completely severed himself from the &quot;international banking system&quot;, and he just took care of the economy from within the country. But was there still trade and things like that, import/export with other countries at the time?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;The problem was as soon as Hitler came to power in 1933, the &quot;International Jewry&quot; declared war on Germany. Much as the same as the sanctions on Iraq, or Iran or Russia at the moment. The point was sanctions were put upon Germany which didn&#39;t make his job any easier but even with all that on top, he got the economy going. One of the ways he got the economy going was, as you say, he removed certain bankers from the system. He removed usury from the system which he always felt was abhorrent just like I do and certainly many other people do as well. So by replacing certain elements of that financial machine that the government was taking over more and more, he implements the creation of jobs. Which is unbelievable. Six or seven million unemployed when he came in and after two or tree years, he cleared it up. Simply by building motorways for instance. Motorways in a stretch of a country. You&#39;d have certain workplaces where men could go and work, they&#39;d stock up all week, go out in the weekend, with money in their pockets. The wives would take the money off them gladly, go out, buy a dress, buy shows, buy clothes, food, whatever. The economy got going and quite simply with this kind of shadow of usury and debt over the top of you. Things started to pick up and within two or three or four years by 1936, he was hosting the Olympics. [Germany was] probably the most happy, buoyant country in the world. You&#39;ve got to remember, the rest of the world was in recession from America and the big myth is that Hitler needed a war to get that recession going. Quite the opposite. America needed that war to get that rid of that recession.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Very interesting. Think about that people. If this story is correct here, if we look at this objectively, what we&#39;re being told here is that [Hitler] is the one who actually broke out of the type of monetary banking system that the world has suffered under for so many years now. Everything that happened with the collapse and the consolidation of more and more wealth into fewer and fewer hands. This is actually someone who tried to break out of that. This is, rightly to say, when Judea declares war on Germany in 1933. The Jewish boycott of German good, etc. There were rallies to boycott Nazi Germany at the time. Held at Madison Square Garden and it was sponsored by the American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee. A lot of people were involved with this and there was a trade war going on at this place basically.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;That&#39;s right. Without a doubt. It got to the point where Germany had to barter, to get those edible barter, they would barter with another country according to what their needs were. Similar to what Venezuela did and are still doing today I believe.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>SEGMENT THREE: HITLER AND THE ROTHSCHILD&#39;S</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Let&#39;s just tackle some of the other myths along the way as well. I&#39;ve heard other stories. That Hitler was basically in on it, he was a Rothschild agent, his mom was really a Rothschild. There were things along the way here that occurred, yes, he was intent on helping to destroy Germany by bringing them into war. There&#39;s a number of versions and variations here. Again this stems from an idea that it&#39;s an impossibility to assume that he was genuine. So we need to reach for any other explanation we can to wrap our head around the mythology we&#39;ve been given afterwords. I think that&#39;s something that occurs, when you get the false story and you try to fit reality into that false story, you have to start changing the objective to have it make sense. What would you say concerning those rumors and conspiracies?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;I&#39;ve always said that actions speak louder than words. It doesn&#39;t matter what anybody says or what anybody proposed to believe to be done. The fact is, the actions taken and the actions that Hitler took a little bit earlier, were up to this point, to break the Versailles treaty. Everything he did was to break that demonic treaty. As far as the Rothschild&#39;s go, he was the only person ever to have jailed a Rothschild. When he entered Austria, I can&#39;t remember which Rothschild it was, he actually put him in jail. They ransomed him out at the end of it all. So where they&#39;re getting this thing about the Rothschild&#39;s, it&#39;s misinformation. It&#39;s similar to the occult thing you mentioned early on. Which I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be discussing a little bit later. But all these actions speak louder than any words than I can speak. Up to this point, you&#39;ve got him changing the banking system, you&#39;ve got him abolishing usury and once the Anschluss comes along, he arrests a Rothschild. What does that tell you?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host: &quot;</strong>It tells you he&#39;s in deep doodoo with the rest of the world. Or those seeking to rule the world with an iron first, they&#39;re going to turn against Germany at that point, right?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;Exactltly. He&#39;s certainly not one of them.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>SEGMENT FOUR: ROOSEVELT AND THE TRIANGLE WITH THE EYE ON TOP</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;So, they&#39;re enemies of communism and despite afterwords hindsight, we&#39;ve heard, I don&#39;t know how many documentaries I&#39;ve seen about how Hitler wanted to create a new world order. He was the one who wanted to conquer the world, take over everything. It feels again, like those situations, where they&#39;ve flipped the arguments and what applies to one here, actually applies to the other. Correct?&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;They do that quite often all the way through. The myth of Germany needing a war, to get the financial situation sorted out. When it was all the time America that needed the war. There&#39;s numerous occasions, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll come across where you&#39;ll flip the coin. People have got to remember in 1933 when Roosevelt came to power, he was the one that brought in this triangle with the eye at the top of it on the back of the US dollar. He was in with the bankers.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &quot;Oh yea. Henry Wallace, he had that guru over there in Tibet.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> &quot;All very sympathetic to communism.&quot;</p>

<p>I lay out months of non stop research for you and all you can do is show me a couple youtube  videos that don&#39;t really say anything? How about this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hosea 13</strong>  </p>

<p>4 Yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.  </p>

<p>5 I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.  </p>

<p>6 According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.  </p>

<p>7 Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them:  </p>

<p>8 I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation 13.</strong>  </p>

<p>The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation 13</strong>  </p>

<p>12 It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. 13 And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people. 14 Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth.</p>

<p><strong>1 Kings 18</strong>  </p>

<p>37Answer me, O LORD! Answer me, so that this people will know that You, the LORD, are God, and that You have turned their hearts back again.” 38Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, and the dust, and it licked up the water in the trench. 39When all the people saw this, they fell facedown and said, “The LORD, He is God! The LORD, He is God!”</p>

<p><strong>Luke 9</strong>  </p>

<p>51 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,  </p>

<p>52 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.  </p>

<p>53 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.  </p>

<p>54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?  </p>

<p>55 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.  </p>

<p>56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men&#39;s lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They took out that last part out the NIV, I wonder why, Seems like Jesus doesn&#39;t approve of bringing fire from the heavens and killing people and says its the wrong spirit.﻿</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First the video is not emotions.  It is Gematria Code being revealed so that the hidden interpretations of the book of Revelation, Daniel and others can finally be understood.</p>

<p>Gematria Code is not easily interpreted. Only a handful of people have undertaken the enormous work.
What your working diligently at, Bible scholars are just now getting the full understanding of.
So perhaps you need to go back and take a second look.</p>

<p>Ok, for starters your putting parts together that don&#39;t belong. 
I have never heard Hosea being used as a supplement to the end times, specifically describing the 7 Trumpets and the beasts.</p>

<p>I Kings 18 correlates with Elijah and Ahab.</p>

<p>Luke 9 is Jesus instructing His disciples.  And yes, He didn&#39;t approve of their solution for that moment.
But don&#39;t put Jesus in a box and assume He will or will not do a thing.  The Lord&#39;s ways are not our ways, and the Lord&#39;s time is completely different than our time.  A day is as a thousand years to the Lord.  The foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>

<p>The details of the visions of the little horn of Daniel 7 and the first beast of Revelation 13 reveal the antichrist of Bible prophecy.
The Beast in Revelation 13 is the same beast as in Daniel 7.
Verses 7 and 8:
7After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things</p>

<p>The only way I can explain it to you is, this is one of the presidents of the USA (44) but it was different from all the presidents who ruled before him, that&#39;s why it had 10 Horns.</p>

<p>The three little Horns plucked up by the roots by this beast were Syria, Libya,and one more country I cannot recall momentarily, but these are the three little Horns plucked up by the (44) beast.
It then skips to where this beast receives a deadly wound and is healed.   I don&#39;t know why but I feel this deadly wound is from being shot in the head.
This deadly wound healed, makes many wander after the beast and at the time appointed, when this beast receives his power, so that he is able to deceive many with lying wonders.</p>

<p>The only encouragement I can offer is:
Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper (2 Chronicles 20:20).</p>

<p>The Kingdom of God is the power of God expressed in deeds; it is that which God does wherein it becomes evident that he is king. </p>

<p>It is not a place or community ruled by God; it is not even the abstract idea of reign or kingship of God. It is quite concretely the activity of God as King of kings.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t post it to correlate to the ends times necessarily. Just pointing out that Yahweh describes himself literally EXACTLY how the first Beast in Revelation is described. And Elijah is described bringing fire from the sky and making everyone bow down to worship Yahweh. Just like how the 2nd Beast is described as doing. Catch my drift? Jesus literally says they do not know what manner of spirit they are. And he rebuked them for even suggesting to do such a thing. It&#39;s foolishness to not take Jesus&#39;s actions and his words as an indication of what he would or wouldn&#39;t do. Otherwise, how are we suppose to follow him? That literally makes no sense to say that we shouldn&#39;t assume Jesus would or wouldn&#39;t do something. That was the ENTIRE point of him coming here. To show up how to live.</p>
