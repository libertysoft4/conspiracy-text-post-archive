    <div class="md"><p>There were only two potential candidates to choose from if you didn&#39;t want to simply waste your vote in these dangerous times and neither was what anyone particularly wanted. </p>

<p>They were just about the two most unpopular candidates in one of the most negative slug-fests anyone has ever had to choose from when it came to picking &quot;the lesser of the two evils&quot;. </p>

<p>Given that, the harsh reality was which one you had the most reasons to distrust and vote <em>against</em>, not that you were any way <em>for</em> the only one that could prevent that one from winning. </p>

<p>You also had no choice about having to stick to why you didn&#39;t want that candidate if you had any hopes of others seeing it the same way as you did.</p>

<p>As far as this forum is concerned there already were any number of scandals and outright conspiracies to both hide and escape the consequences of them that both of the Clintons have been involved in over many decades and a closet full of conveniently dead bodies who all had the potential to expose some of those but never lived to. </p>

<p>Trump had made some questionable business deals and rubbed shoulders with some questionable people along the way but nothing that really begins to compare with that.</p>

<p>Another point worth mentioning is all of the completely true  information that WikiLeaks revealed over the course of that election in addition to their history of revealing information that has proved that the government and agencies like the NSA and CIA have very deliberately lied to and deceived the public on any number of important issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really pretty simple what happened here. The original users were pissed when it got overtaken by pro Trump/Russian propaganda and general political bs. Then, all those users got banned for speaking out against that narrative. This pissed them off. </p>

<p>Now, they continue to come here to post against any obvious pro Trump/Russian political bullshit. As the bans grew, the numbers of pissed off anti Trump narrative users grew and now you have the shit show we see today. With the pro Trump/Russian side calling every downvoted thread a brigade. When in reality these &quot;brigades&quot; are just threads of people who got unfairly banned for speaking out about a conspiracy sub blindly praising the federal government in a cultish manner. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on my experience as an almost daily member here for the past 6 years, the average political stance of members on this subreddit has been well outside the left-right paradigm, and certainly not right-leaning. The people here used to understand that both parties, along with a large number of US govt institutions and private businesses, are terribly corrupt and horrible entities. It was also obvious that right-leaning politicians undermined the public and world at large in a significantly more visible manner. It was simply a given. And of course democrats will fuck shit up much the same, but they tend to make an effort to convince people otherwise. So as a conspiracy researcher, how could anyone support Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton? This sub wasn&#39;t overtly right of center until the ramp up to the 2016 presidential election. </p>

<p>Take a look at the sidebar image for proof: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130719125446/http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/">https://web.archive.org/web/20130719125446/http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/</a></p>

<p>If it weren&#39;t so sad, it would be laughable that we have such partisan members now, like yourself. </p>

<p>While this subreddit typically had the reputation of being right-leaning, if you bothered to read the comments it was very clear that was not the case. Hell, I remember one time back then I had a staunch communist educate me on the differences between vanguardism and communism, and why I misunderstood the problems we&#39;ve seen when countries try to move towards communism. I still don&#39;t necessarily agree with what they were implying, but it was a civil, educational discussion about subversive topics. You simply can&#39;t have those discussions with the majority of those who migrated here. Frankly, you typically won&#39;t find those type of people on this subreddit anymore, and that&#39;s honestly a shame. </p>

<p>5-6 years ago this sub would have been just as against both Trump and Hillary, seeing as most all of the subreddit members at that time could realize how foolish the vast majority of the US political system is, not just one party.</p>

<p>I mean ffs, there&#39;s an article from fox news on the front page and you&#39;re complaining about this place being anti-Trump</p>

<p>To be blunt, imo it didn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t make sense for anyone who supports/supported Trump or Hillary to actively participate in this subreddit. The level of cognitive dissonance it would take to do that is astounding, and it&#39;s so damn common now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. But if it’s invite only with strict rules, can’t it be maintained? I never made a sub but I’m gonna try. There needs to be a place that discusses real conspiracies. I’ve came across so many people who get it. And the cointelpro in this sub is blatantly obvious. Those fools would get booted from my sub immediately. </p>

<p>Political conspiracies are everpresent; bring up Trump and everyone has an opinion, so the number of comments grows exponentially.  Bring up Babylonian bloodlines or the Council for Foreign Affairs and you&#39;re left with the dozen people who have gone down that spiecific rabbit hole posting quality while everyone else feels like they have nothing to add, so they read the comments, ask a couple questions, up/downvote and leave.</p>

<p>This is likely a large factor</p>

<p>I was basically &quot;raised&quot; on this subreddit. I found it during a very formative time in my life, and the knowledge I absorbed here completely changed the way I perceive events and information. There&#39;s just too much verifiable, documented proof of outright deceit and evil, in all aspects of life, to think of things the way I did before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long gone are the days of redditquette, my friend. I still hardly downvote anyone, joke&#39;s on me I guess</p>

<p>At least we were able to help realize one goal of those former r/conspiracy posters, we gave them a receptive audience to inform and open the eyes of</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m immensely thankful that I was able to learn from those people. I don&#39;t know where else I could have had such a transformative period so quickly, and realizing that scares me a little bit. Where are the present and future, coming-of-age generations going to get a crash course in American imperialism? Who&#39;s going to tell them to read Propaganda by Edward Bernays? Who&#39;s going to tell them about William Binney? This place used to be a god damned institution, the more I think about it the more upset I get. I&#39;m rambling, but you get the point</p>

<p>Well, all we can do is carry the torch, I suppose</p>
