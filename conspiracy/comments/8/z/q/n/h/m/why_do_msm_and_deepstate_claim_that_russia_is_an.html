        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hillary Clinton called for a no fly zone over Syria. What that means is that the American military would shoot down any aircraft in the no fly zone, including Russians. Hillary and her Zionist deep state mafia would gladly have started WW3.  Ask yourslef, &quot;what does America gain from overthrowing Assad in Syria?  NOTHING. </p>

<p>What did America have to gain from invading Iraq? NOTHING. Lybia? NOTHING.  </p>

<p>So why are Hiallry,  DNC, and deep state never trumpers willing to risk WW3 when America has nothing to gain from it? THEY ARE ALL. FUNDED AND CONTROLLED BY A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT. </p>

<p>Russiagate is nothing more than a deep state gaslighting campaign.  The same deep state players that brought you the false flag on 9/11 are promising that some super secret evidence of Russian collusion exists, but we can&#39;t see it. Just like WMDs. Just like the Anthrax. Just like when Seth Rogans movie was hacked by the North Koreans. Jewish media is a threat to America.  If you need anymore evidence than the entirety of the past 15 to 20 years, you might be asleep.</p>

<p>Propaganda/spin is to be expected, but to fabricate conspiracy theories in an attempt to deligitimize a valid election really does cross the line. What the Jewish media and Zionist deep state are engaging in is close to an act of war, in my opinion. Jewish media framed Muslims for 9/11 and still do to this day. Now they want to frame our president.  Were they looking out for the average American when they went to war in Iraq? No. Are they looking out for the average American by trying invalidate/overthrow trump? No.</p>

<p>All media owened by jews exists to further Jewish interests. From JFK, to 9/11, to the moon landing to Russiagate, from CNN to Fox and from Vice to Reddit.  All fake news created by foreign governments in order to meddle in EVERY AMERICAN ELECTION</p>

<p>what does America gain from overthrowing Assad in Syria? NOTHING.</p>

<p>Well Russia loses a naval base in the Med, a client state turns into a NATO puppet, and there is a proposed pipeline running through it isn&#39;t there?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What did America have to gain from invading Iraq? NOTHING.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Saudi Arabian and Israeli approval I believe, that huge amount of oil, a show of force to Iran and Syria (and the world), maybe if you really hate him, George Bush finished his daddys war. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lybia[sic]? NOTHING.</p>

<p>I think this is an EU-led operation, America provided lots of support. The before-last French President was the first one to call for the action I believe. Then the Brits, then the US Senate.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya</a></p>

<p>But I mean, you go ahead and think the US had nothing to gain. Massive contracts for rebuilding, tightened NATO control over the Med and Oil, show of power to the ME and North Africa. </p>
