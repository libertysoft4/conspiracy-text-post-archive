        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I suspected that those posts were to distract from Trumps embarrassing display yesterday on the world stage. I saw multiple people calling out Trump for his support of Putin being labelled “neocons” and “warmongers” to even consider believing the validity of IC evidence that Russia made a coordinated effort to meddle in 2016 election. Now that Trump has once again pulled a 180, claiming he now DOES believe the evidence brought forth by U.S. intelligence, you would think the same people would be calling Trump a neocon and warmonger. I guess we’ll see within the day of those posts were actually organic, or if they were just to distract from Trump being spineless while in the presence of Putin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mean to say that that sort of discussion is necessarily counter-productive, and this forum is certainly one of the apt places for it. I simply mean that it&#39;s not a very conclusive approach, and one that is particularly limited by ones biases.</p>

<p>FWIW, I think one of the most critical motives for both Russia and the US for a number of recent confrontations have been related to an economic rivalry over pipelines and gas exports. I&#39;m also painfully aware that this investigation into Russian interference has granted an excuse to allow the DNC to avoid any introspection or reform after its rigging its primary in 2016, but as a slighted ex-Bernie supporter I recognize that&#39;s some of that bias I was mentioning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could be one of those people that &quot;defends&quot; Trump.  Mostly because I dont see proof yet that Trump colluded with the Russians.  I do see allegations that once presented in court and defended by lawyers may turn out to be evidence enough.  But as of now it is a collection of allegations put together by the state in an indictment of Russians that most likely will never see court.  The last ones didnt.  However, if it goes to court I will watch with an open mind.  </p>

<p>That being said, I think he is somewhat of a Neocon.  Bombin Syria with no evidence, twice.  Illegally (just like all presidents) and his move with the Israeli embassy are two disdain able things I can think of off the top of my head.  If the left had the balls to impeach him over illegal bombings and missile strikes I would be all for it.  But every president does that.  So would have Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wanna go through the new queue for the past few days and do a count on that?</p>

<p>Well yeah if the attack is always the same old unsourced nonsense the defense doesn&#39;t change. It really sucks that pointing out an argument has nothing backing it up is considered defending Hillary to some people, plenty of us hate her but also hate seeing this sub parrot lies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in fairness to the organic users of this sub, we&#39;ve always questioned IC motivations irrespective of the political party or person at the helm. Can you point to any public info from IC that wasn&#39;t eventually proven false or misleading? A lot of us are still rolling our eyes at the Russian narrative and you can see from my history that I&#39;m as far from a Trump supporter as can be. It&#39;s the same way I feel when we hear that Assad has inexplicably gassed more citizens... it all reeks of manufactured consent.</p>

<p>So I think there&#39;s a level of frustration from regular users at the brigading and/or inorganic activity here that&#39;s causing a swell of &quot;WTF is going on anymore?&quot; threads. Anyway, that&#39;s how I see it. I&#39;m a real user, I&#39;m not pro-Trump, I&#39;m probably more pro-Russian than pro-US at this point just based on what I&#39;ve learned over the years about our ceaseless imperialism, but I still want the best for my fellow Americans. I would definitely have written one of these posts because it&#39;s disturbing to see people lining up for their propaganda feedings.</p>

Seeing different opinions on the subject with justified reasoning and without political bias is refreshing, and is honestly the best discussion I have seen on this sub all day.

    <div class="md"><p>I can tell you from experience that is not a sudden influx. The only reason I still frequent this sub is to see trump supporters get criticized for their tribalistic support. That happens in literally every thread, except for after the summit, which has been very strange.

<p>I don’t assume I know anything. I know this sub and I know you are not a regular here. So your “what happened here” post is nothing more than a way for you to dig at the users here that support the president. Creating more divisive rhetoric. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming this is one of your alts? Because again, you are he only one attacking my legitimacy in this thread lol. It is the only reason I still come here every day, yes. I don’t like echo chambers, I appreciate good discussion. It just so happens that Trump supporters always have their heads up their asses so they are the ones that get slammed with hard evidence of which they have no coherent rebuttal. The constant brigading sucks, but the reason stated above is my favorite part of this subreddit. Why that somehow makes me you think that I’m an inorganic user I have no idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I really just think that Trump is trying to save face. </p>

<p>Did russian meddle in our election? Idk. The CIA or FBI is claiming they did. But can you trust what those organizations say? Where&#39;s the evidence?</p>

<p>How many times have they been wrong in the past and given us false information that we found is untrue years later? WMD? False. NSA? False. </p>

<p>We are anti-establishment and the CIA and FBI are establishment. They have an agenda.</p>

<p>I understand people hate Trump and want to think that Russia &quot;meddled&quot; in our election. I feel like the bottom line is that information was release (doesn&#39;t matter by who) and it was damming to Clinton. Maybe she shouldn&#39;t be so crooked. </p>

<p>Why are we focused on who released the information rather than why the information was so damming for her campaign? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump isn’t any better than Clinton if you listen to what he says when he speaks, read what he tweets, and analyze his policies. Forget what MSM has to say about him, supporting Trump at this point isn’t justified by any means. There is no arguing that he is somehow anti-establishment unless your support is  unwavering in the face of, well, most things he has done and said since he was inaugurated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So people that think this sub should not be political and only be about conspiracies should take a political stance against Donald Trump, a political puppet? I don’t think you understand what those posts are about. One of the biggest conspiracies is our mainstream media and politics are tools that distract people from our real enemies. So no don’t want to see people talking shit on Trump or praising him. That’s the point of those posts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that U.S. intelligence has lied before, so if we’re constantly talking about meddling and collusion, maybe instead of taking sides right away we can determine for ourselves who has the motive to lie. What are they getting out of it? Those questions seem to easily be answered when discussing 9/11, WMD’s, etc. If you can’t trust any sources involved, maybe determine for yourself who is benefitting and how?</p>
