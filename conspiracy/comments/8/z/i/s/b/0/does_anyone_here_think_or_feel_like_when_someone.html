        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off let me please state that I am in no way shape or form, transphobic,homophobic or hateful or discriminatory or anything of the sort pertaining to the topic at hand. Nor am I trying to be insulting or hurtful by affiliating this topic with a conspiratorial agenda. This isn&#39;t meant to spark argument, but rather discussion, and relatabilty, strictly based on the nature and intended purpose of this sub. Thank you.</p>

<p>First off, I would like to paint a mental picture for you all, based on a hypothetical situation that maybe some, or most of us have been in. Has anybody ever been in a situation, at a bar or social event, where you were sitting down in isolation and were approached by a random group of innocent strangers,who were looking to know if they could share your seating environment with you. You say of course, there&#39;s plenty of room. The group consist of 3 or 4 unique individuals who fit a very abstract demographic amongst society. Possibly even reminding you of yourself,  to some varying  degree and an existing, undertone of collective relatable &quot; progressiveness &quot;.</p>

<p>One of the individuals can be stereotyped as what they call in the lesbian culture as a &#39; Dyke or butch &#39;. a very androgynous character that dosent fit the stereotype of a heterosexual female of society, but wheres it in their genetic make up.</p>

<p>Then the other individual of the group is an obvious male character, dressed in a Polky dot dress, rocking a Hulk Hogan mustache, has a powder toast man chin, with subtle 5 o&#39;clock shadow, and a feminized man bun..a trans bun in this case.</p>

<p>The male individual gets up to grab a drink before any real opening dialogue ensues. So it&#39;s you an the 3 individuals that just joined you in your isolation. You begin a conversation with the butch girl, asking each other the basic questions of first time, friendly interaction. You then suddenly, inquire about their friend who just got up to go grab a drink, and the exchange kind of went something like this,</p>

<p>Butchy: &quot;I grew up in Alaska, but was born Boston. Been livin here now for about...uhh..4 yeeeears now? Yeah about 4 years. I love it here. And what about you? You from here?&quot;</p>

<p>You: &quot;yeah actually, I&#39;m a native of these parts. It&#39;s a cool city, but you know I think I might be over it. Think I&#39;m ready to explore, and see what&#39;s out there, ya know?&quot;</p>

<p>Butchy: &quot; oh absolutely, you gotta travel man! The worlds so big, and there&#39;s lots going on. I&#39;m sure once you figure everything out, you&#39;ll be traveling in no time&quot;</p>

<p>You: &quot;Thanks for the encouraging words. Yeah I can&#39;t wait!. So your friend, is he also from Alaska?&quot;</p>

<p>Butchy: &quot;its SHE&quot;</p>

<p>You: &quot;what?&quot;</p>

<p>Butchy: &quot;it&#39;s SHE. They&#39;re preferred pronouns are they and she&quot;</p>

<p>...And of course, you do just as any other respectable human being in society would do, you apologize. You apologize for being right and assuming what you know to be the truth. And you get this twilight zone feeling. Do any of you ever ask yourself,</p>

<p>&quot;too what degree do I have to participate in these individuals fantasy?&quot;</p>

<p>Imagine having to explain this to a kid who innocently makes this natural correlation of what is and what is supposed to be. I totally understand this is a new world, but for the first huuuge portion of my life, this reality has never existed. Matter of a fact.. it just started happening. I literally live in a world where I have to ask a woman with boobs and a vagina if she infact identifies as being a woman with bobs and a vagina. </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious to know if anyone here feels like, this new phenomenon has had any impact of them mentally? How do you all feel about this recent acceleration on gender identity. Is it mental illness? Programming? Self importance? ego? Genetic?</p>

<p>Please feel free to express your thoughts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve learned stereotypes are a horrible indicator of sexual preference. I&#39;ve met all types of men and women who were homosexual. Practicaly non fit the stereotype. I can actually think of only one girl that did. The gay men were all different types. One was a fat slob, one was married and what you would consider a alpha male, one was average slender geek, one was average popular working type, and so on.</p>

<p>My best friends ex-wife&#39;s dad was a mom. Frankly I just called her &#39;her&#39; and it really didn&#39;t effect me or matter the slightest. No one else seemed to mind or care.</p>

<p>There are assholes of all types out there. Don&#39;t judge an entire group by a few bad apples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it more interesting that your entire post seems to ignore/deride/rebel against the mere possibility that perhaps they are trying to allow people to be what they want to be.  </p>

<p>Rather than getting so upset that you have to &quot;ask a woman with boobs and a vagina if she in fact identifies as being a woman&quot;, why not contemplate whether or not it matters IN YOUR LIFE in the slightest WHAT she is?  </p>

<p>Unless you are a male trying to hit on this potential woman, who gives a flying **** what she is or what she/he identifies as?   </p>

<p>The real answer is that it doesn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>Anything else, IMO, is choosing to be intolerant for no good reason. And it&#39;s IMO honestly a waste of time.  </p>

<p>Just let people be what they want to be. Why is that so hard?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work at a university. They instruct us to introduce ourselves explaining what our preferred pronoun is. I wont. My director has thrown shade at people for not automatically asking what a person&#39;s pronoun is.. 99% of people go by an obvious pronoun. Why would I waste my breath introducing my pronoun and asking everyone I meet what their pronoun is.

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. Yeah it&#39;s pretty outrageous. Especially where I live. Because the sense of entitlement has damn near quadrupled. It&#39;s waay to extremely easy to offend people when you aren&#39;t even trying. On the flip side of your story, in some cases it&#39;s offensive to even ask. People expect you to just know, and ask no questions and not put them on the spot. I got invited to this party the weekend, and I met a ton of girls ( it was a women&#39;s party ). I&#39;m a very magnetic guy, and I&#39;m approached constantly and also have this natural card/pass to be able to approach people who give me a their time an day. I gave my number and exchanged my number with like 7 or more girls who seemed more open with their sexuality.</p>

<p>I got a reply from various numbers that I also replyed too.
I ended up having a text thread going from this one number that texted me &quot; Hi &quot;. I felt bad about not remembering who it was ( even though looking back it was justified for me to do so ). I suggest we go to a bar I like to frequent from time to time. I get there, and then the girl I&#39;m texting gets there. When she strolls through..She&#39;s a little  half white / half Asian trans boy who is extremely passable. With my sober mind I was able to see the details in their face and put everything together. The weird part is that I didn&#39;t catch it even then until we ordered drinks and sat down. And I looked at their face and it kind of liked.. morphed. It was the trippiest thing, it was like I felt my brain re-wiring and trying to crack the code to identify this person for me as a male. It was very surreal, because even though I&#39;m sure.. I&#39;m still also vaguely not sure because I never asked or brought it up, nor did they tell me.  Very bizarre times </p>
