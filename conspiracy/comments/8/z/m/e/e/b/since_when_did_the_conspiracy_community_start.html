<p>This reminds me of when Trump supporters declared the Syria chemical weapons attack was a false flag, then when intelligence confirmed it was Assad, Trump supporters were on board 100% with decision to airstrike. Get your talking points together, your president just pulled a 180...like he always does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s sad to see skeptics side with a Russian dictator over U.S. intelligence agencies, in relation to a crime that Putin is accused of orchestrating against the U.S. which seems to be working out great for Russia (circumstantial evidence that they at least had a motive to meddle). Hell, Putin even declared yesterday that he wanted Trump to win publicly. Even knowing that intelligence agencies have lied in the past, that doesn’t make Putin trustworthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No,  what sad is to see neocon war mongers piss on an opportunity for peace after Americans have learned they have been lied into war after war since 2003.</p>

<p>But then again,  just follow the money,  the corruption,  the corporate welfare of a military police establishment that has taken away the freedoms we used to cherish.</p>

<p>No one is suggesting that the US and Russia are not competitors,  but trust based on verification is the only reason this planet has not already been incinerated in a nuclear inferno.   What you are suggesting brings the world closer to that inferno,  not further away from it,  based on no evidence of any substance.</p>

<p>Who ever it was who leaked out the emails of criminals like Podesta and Clinton,  who we know did collude with Russia,  and it was not likely Russia,  should be thanked.   Any US patriot would want that pile of treason exposed,  that pay to play,  that corruption of the American electoral process that was so actively encouraged by the DNC.    If it was available for the RNC I would expect we should have the right to see that as well.</p>

<p>Many people, some paid and some not, are coming to this sub in an attempt to make it like the rest of a Reddit. An establishment dick-sucking, narcissistic, “let’s see how funny I can be and how many upvotes I get”, meaningless void.</p>

<p>If I were a moderator of this sub I would fight for better rules. Rules like:</p>

<p>1) Posts that are nothing more than a link to an MSM news article, with a title the same as or similar to said news article, will be immediately removed. (If we wanted to read MSM bullshit we would go straight to their website site. Guess what? We aren’t coming to this sub to read it.)</p>

<p>You get the idea. Users that can’t think beyond Democrat vs. Republican and who have absolutely no interest in discovering the truth have ruined this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep - I still think the mod team is good here. They&#39;ve tried to implement things to help. Not allowing posts from young accounts and submission statements eliminated a lot of the general spam like yournewswire, etc. But the brigading and/or paid shilling and bots are another matter and completely out of control. You can watch it slow down during holidays. The couple of days over July 4 were amazing - it was like the week after the 2016 elections. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> blissfully returned to its natural state.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know how you combat this without more insight into the poster (like IP address). It seems like there should be some aggregate database that finds similarities in posts and can flag potentially artificial users.</p>

<p>I agree about the blind links to MSM though. If you can be bothered to add some unique analysis to a story then there&#39;s no reason to share it here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you soo on too much for saying this. I have run into brick walls on here from it. Lots of people on here think that it is only Dems vs GOP. If something is against your side, you have to attack it instead of actually look into it. They don&#39;t even want to think that their side could be dirty.</p>

<p>This is why I compare politics to sports. If you are a fan of a team, it doesn&#39;t matter how dirty that team is, fans don&#39;t care. They will justify or downplay it and continue rooting them on, even defending them. This is not what this sub is about and it sure as fuck isn&#39;t what politics should be about. This sub is about finding the truth, no matter what. That has been lost since political operatives realized they can come on online, start a narrative they want, and their supporters will back it no matter what. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only does Putin recognize and respect Israel&#39;s occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights, Israel <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/israel-syria-safe-buffer-zone-golan-heights/">got a whole new chunk of Syria.</a></p>

<p>Still, you are right the Syria situation is somewhat puzzling.</p>

<p>In my interpretation, the central planners aren’t truly against Putin, as explained; more so, they are helping him domestically by doing what they&#39;re doing with this pretend-Russophobia and their imperialism / war-mongering in the Middle-East (Putin is now a hero in his country for his intervention in Syria, he didn’t even need to fake it in order to be “reelected”).</p>

<p>Also Israel didn&#39;t necessarily want to topple Assad, and get utter chaos right at its border (even if it does control the Salafi islamists that would have replaced him). See Lybia or Iraq: controlling the chieftains doesn&#39;t equate with the ability to rule. </p>

<p>In my opinion a key goal in Syria was to weaken Hezbollah (which they correctly presumed would get involved), in preparation for their next war against Lebanon. When they saw it was having the opposite effect, Putin “stepped in” to put an end to the war, and hand Israel a new chunk of the country.</p>

<p>Also I think the Zionists wouldn&#39;t mind a fair amount of devastation in Israel during the next war. That would comfort the domestic populations&#39; inculcated victim complex, and would give them pseudo-moral cover for more Arab democide and land grab.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7uesbo/im_going_to_explain_something_that_i_fear_many/">Remember the Zionists are the truly antisemitic.</a></p>

<p>Until they deal with this rotten relationship, they cannot be trusted. AIPAC is what gave Trump the office, not a few Russian Facebook adverts. Sub is filled with people that have no sense of proportion.</p>

You are a westerner you literally don&#39;t know anything about Russia, my country has been targeted by Russian hackers, propaganda and trolls since 1991.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with idiots is that they think a &quot;liar&quot; is a person who never tells the truth, and a &quot;trustworthy&quot; person never lies. Neither of these people have ever existed on this planet.</p>

<p>Sometimes trustworthy people lie. Sometimes liars tell the truth. The &quot;truth&quot; wears no capital &quot;T&quot;. It has to be ground out and worked against the things we think we know.</p>

<p>The OP clearly wants everyone to disregard <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mueller-indictments-dnc-hacks-guccifer-roger-stone-2018-7">the indictments of Russian GRU operatives</a>. Why? Because the OP wants more people to believe the POTUS isn&#39;t in Putin&#39;s pocket. I&#39;d love to have the luxury to believe that. But the facts do not fit this narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fairly new here. When I think of conspiracy theories, I first think of government, JFK,RFK, Vietman war.  Since my eyes, and many others have been opened by Wikileaks and the like,  of course we would seek to follow that same path.  Honestly, I come here to see what&#39;s happening in our government, since MSM is all propaganda. Sorry If the government talk is overwhelming, but you still have the option of posting about other worldly conspiracies. I probably won&#39;t participate, as what&#39;s happening  in this country, on this planet is scary enough. I&#39;m not yet ready for a new awakening of that sort. PS. I never down vote, but maybe we need to upvote these posts to keep it versatile. Could that help? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s somewhat a mistake to think there ever was a &quot;conspiracy community&quot;. Communities in real life develop around shared values and shared interest, not shared enemies. Conspiracy theorists are largely brought together only by a shared cynicism, but without shared vision, of course any semblance of community would be coopted. </p>

<p>The parallels to the current Democratic party are quite striking. The Democratic party is only really united against Trump. Not that they don&#39;t have many good reasons to be against him, but nothing will grow from that. </p>

<p>We as a species have become cynical and distrustful, and not for unfounded reasons, but that&#39;s not enough. </p>
