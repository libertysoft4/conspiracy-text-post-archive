        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They are always reports of Gun stocks rallying after mass shootings (as they alway do). Say if I am CEO of a gun stock, I would regularly do an operation where I might pay some kid/person to regularly shoot up a place and then immediately dump my stock after shooting happens.</p>

<p>Massive profits to be made in this pump and dump scheme. So by logic of &quot;Follow the money&quot;, the most to gain from shootings is gun company execs. Is it possible the shootings are all done by people who were actually paid by NRA/Gun companies to temporarily prop up the stock to engage this stock &quot;pump and dump&quot; scheme ?</p>

<p>Makes total sense if you &quot;follow the money&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s &quot;I should buy guns because a bunch of assholes who think you can legislate this problem away are going to try to ban a bunch of shit, again.&quot;</p>

<p>And, to a lesser extent, &quot;shit, there&#39;s going to be a huge run on guns from people who are worried about gun bans, so I&#39;d better buy that thing I&#39;ve had my eye on while it&#39;s still an option.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting idea. I don&#39;t agree with it and I think the stocks rise just because people buy thinking somebody might try to ban them afterwards, but I appreciate an actual conspiracy post. Depends if the person cares about long term or short term games I suppose</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure I mean it&#39;s possible. I just don&#39;t believe it&#39;s  True. Like I said it probably depends on long term versus short term goals. If we had a shooting everyday where 10 to 20 kids died in an elementary school then there&#39;s a good chance that despite the 2nd amemendment a gun ban might go into effect in some way. Gun companies would have a hard time making any money if guns were banned. Plus these jumps mentioned were 3%.. long term the market will rise 10%. Doesn&#39;t seem worth it IMO. Not saying it isn&#39;t possible, just doesn&#39;t seem probable</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.</p>

<p>They most likely aren&#39;t directly orchestrating the shootings (although I wouldn&#39;t completely rule that out) but they sure as shit don&#39;t mind them! </p>

<p>Also they have no problem with supporting organizations producing propaganda videos calling American citizens terrorists if they support sensible gun laws. Or ramping up the &quot;they&#39;re coming for your guns&quot; rhetoric every chance they get. Lots of money to be made by putting fear in every head and a gun in every hand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The news media has an implicit deal with the psychopaths of the world that if you kill lots of people they will make you look cool and tell the world your grievances.

    <div class="md"><p>So are you saying that the liberal media and the democrats are helping gun manufactures make record profits?</p>

<p>Because people buy guns after mass shootings for two reasons: 1) They become concious of the need to protect themselves. 2) The entire liberal media and left come out demanding gun bans.</p>

<p>So the driving factors are all due to the left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, the shootings are done because we kinda suck as a society, and give people access to something that will let them ‘prove’ they are ‘worth something’. They aren’t typically done by happy people.</p>

<p>Gun companies cheer though, because it boosts their profits.</p>

<p>I just wish the real pro gun guys would be the ones proposing how to stop it. They are the people most qualified to sort out how to keep their rights while stopping people who shouldn’t have them from getting guns - instead of just getting angry and pearl clutching.</p>

<p>Otherwise extremists will eventually take those rights.</p>
