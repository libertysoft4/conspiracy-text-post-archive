    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t anything specific Trump did that set them off; it was the face to face meeting with Putin itself.  For almost two years now they&#39;ve stated that Trump is in Putin&#39;s pocket, so with this press conference and closed door meeting they saw an opportunity to further that narrative and score some points with the public at the expense of Trump.  They&#39;re not genuinely responding to his words, the words are immaterial in themselves.  They&#39;re playing the outrage card to rally people against Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A small minority of the MSM reporting that I’ve seen has revolved around a few sentences that trump said, and the vast majority has been basically high- brow Insults. Saying it is the worst performance of a president they’ve ever seen, saying that he looking like an asset dealing with his handler, and the general complete lack of variation in degree of these claims. Just looking at it from a ratio analysis perspective the majority of the reporting revolves around other people’s interpretation, rather than reporting in full what was actually said. This is not a new phenomenon. </p>

<p>The media really doesn’t even have to listen to what people say, and I’ve found that when you go to the source, you realize how much “spin” (read: lies) you are receiving. </p>

<p>Finally, I think the greater thing to consider is the escalation of tension between the greatest nuclear powers on earth. It really seems like people don’t realize it will be THEY are sent to slaughter. It won’t be Trump, and it won’t be his kids. It won’t be anyone who actually makes the decision to go to war. It will be the citizens who die. I don’t like Trump, but I appreciate the effort to decrease tension. I don’t want to die in battle over a damn unfounded Russian email hack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether he is or isn&#39;t a war criminal is irrelevant. You&#39;re expressing a narrative yet asking for replies to do the opposite. By using McCain as an example instead of the literal dozens of politicians and news agencies saying the same, you&#39;re trying to provoke a partisan response because of the recent history between him and Trump. And by labeling him a war criminal, whether true or not, you&#39;re painting the narrative of &quot;this obviously very bad guy thinks Trump is doing something wrong, look at how crazy the accusations must then be.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The narrative since the Start of the COld war is &quot;Russia Bad, America Good&quot;</p>

<p>Now we have a case that alleges the Russians tried to Interfere in US Politics. </p>

<p>The President who is supposed to be the Poster Child for &quot;America good, Russia Bad&quot; is saying, Hey &quot;Putin is an okay guy&quot;</p>

<p>This sets of warning bells and scares people.</p>

<p>TL dr: Us and Russia have been enemies for so long, peace between them cannot exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. That&#39;s not how this works. Calling a politician a war criminal is not partisan because political party has nothing to do with being a war criminal. We&#39;ve all seen the pictures of John McCain posing with ISIS leaders. Getting in a huff over the accusation may be partisan. Making the accusation is not. </p>
