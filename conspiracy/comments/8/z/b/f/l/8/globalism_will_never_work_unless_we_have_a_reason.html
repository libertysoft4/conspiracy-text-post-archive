    <div class="md"><p>In the book &quot;The Sovereign Individual&quot; [from 1997] the two authors (John Dale Davidson and Sir William Rees-Mogg] talk about the coming collapse of the Atlanticist &quot;power grid&quot;. </p>

<p>They produce a fine volume talking about how, after the Industrial Revolution, the tendency was toward centralization. Due to centralization, the single shops from tradesmen were replaced by mega-factories. Growth was the new pattern.</p>

<p>This &quot;organizing principle&quot; started to fray, however, when technology started creating a new de-centralization model. For instance, in the past you had to go to a central hub to buy or trade. Now you can do it online, from your bedroom in your pajamas. You used to have to go to a centralized location, be it a stock exchange, or a national capital. </p>

<p>But technology is rendering that all obsolete.</p>

<p>These large institutions are also falling apart for another reason: The Silo Effect. Jillian Tett wrote a great book, with that title, about large corporations, whose departments stop communicating, with the result that the whole system eventually breaks down.</p>

<p>Large institutions, in other words, are subject to the Law of Entropy.</p>

<p>So, in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, they had this notion that centralization was the future. That bigger was better. That top-down control would always be the rule. </p>

<p>So they laid plans to set up a One World Government . . . utterly unaware that technology would start undermining them as the 21st Century dawned. </p>

<p>The very idea of &quot;Globalism&quot; is antiquated. It&#39;s inappropriate. </p>

<p>The Power-Elite are now panicking, because they realize that the jig is up. No one wants to be ruled by them.</p>

<p>And now, thanks to the democraticization of technology, countries in the developing world aren&#39;t reliant on the West (as they were in previous centuries).</p>

<p>Their big mistake was letting Western technology get into the hands of non-Western players. Once that happened, they doomed any prospect they might have had to be able to coerce them into compliance (and vassal status). </p>

<p>&quot;Empire&quot; is a very ancient (Babylonian) concept. And the Power-Elite are only now starting to realize that the plans they spent so much time hatching are rooted in a now-obsolete paradigm. </p>

The selection process involved taking measurements of the citizen&#39;s dimensions. It was believed that their inner essence was reflected by their beauty.
