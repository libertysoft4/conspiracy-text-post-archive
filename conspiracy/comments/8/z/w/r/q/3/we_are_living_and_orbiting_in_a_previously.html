<p>Richard Hoagland&#39;s thoughts on the possibility of an ancient civilization inhabiting our solar system. Talks about the potential coverup of such information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I used to be straight mainstream, as you said; Cronkite&#39;s advisor, NASA, etc., Museums, mainstream science, hung out with Carl Sagan, Arthur Clarke, one of my best friends until he died, Gene Rodenberry and all that. Anyway, so what got me into to all of this, and why we&#39;re having this discussion this evening, about thirty or forty years ago, I started looking at some images of Mars, and I realized that there was something astonishing, that other scientists, other journalists, other investigators had not all put together, and that is that there appears to be a global civilization, an ancient, extraordinarily high tech civilization that once lived on Mars and is no more. And that collapses probably twenty years into one sentence, because NASA&#39;s not been cooperative, you know they&#39;re the ones initially taking all these images, and its only because of leaks, because of finding other versions of images, of finding people who are willing to talk about what they&#39;ve seen in the labs like at JPL or in Houston or other place at NASA, that we&#39;ve kind of pieced together the idea that NASA for the last fifty years if not slightly longer, given that its first spacecraft was launched in January of 1958, it has been engaged in a methodical, systematic coverup of everything that&#39;s real in the solar system made by somebody. They&#39;ll tell us the geology, they&#39;ll go on about the magnetospheres, and the radiation and the particles and the layered sediments and the various atmospheric properties. The thing they cannot go near, the thing that they won&#39;t touch, the thing that they haven&#39;t told us the truth about from day one is the fact that we&#39;re living, Earth now twenty first century, we are living and orbiting in a previously inhabited solar system whose inhabitants wielded technology that was basically the equivalent of the gods, as my old friend Arthur Clarke would say &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,&quot; this technology, this physics is basically magic. It seems to contradict what we think we know in terms of EM physics, and it allowed them to remodel and remake and reorder the entire solar system, and then something incredible happened, a long time ago, millions of years ago, we really don&#39;t have any kind of exact date yet because we don&#39;t have ground truth, and everything went away, and we&#39;re what&#39;s left, we&#39;re the survivors. Are we the survivors of the guys who originally did all this, millions or even billions of years ago? Is the human race the logical successor, genetic successor to these beings? I have no idea, because again, we don&#39;t have ground truth. What I can say to you tonight is that everything that NASA has told us about the solar system, everything that ESA which is the European Space Agency has told us, everything the Japanese have told us, everything the Russians have told us, everything the Chinese, and the Indians,... everyone of these nations is part of a cabal to basically withhold announcing, discussing, presenting, describing, outlining or explaining the real artificial stuff out there, which is all over, from Mercury we now know to Pluto. And instead they&#39;ve given us a sterile solar system, sans the works of intelligence, because somehow, that subject, who we really are, who we really are descended from, and what really happened in the past is all taboo.</p>

Your reaction has been pre-programmed into you by the Luciferian powers hat be.  All they care about is that you never realize you need Jesus Christ&#39;s blood atonement so that your soul spends eternity in the lake of fire.  That&#39;s why they created the wet spinning ball flying around in outer space lie to begin with; to discredit the legitimacy of the Scriptures.  If you knew for a fact you were on a flat, motionless, enclosed earth that you couldn&#39;t escape from then you would realize this as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a combination of spiritual discernment, scripture verses, and temporal study.  A lot more than I can put into a post but the quick and dirty is:</p>

<p>Psa 12:6  The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. 
Psa 12:7  Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.</p>

<p>The words of God is going to be preserved (originals aren&#39;t currently available) and it will be purified many times over.  This means improvement over time or refined.</p>

<p>Isa_34:16  Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: </p>

<p>There are many verses like the above that show that God&#39;s words are in a book.</p>

<p>If you ask any scholar that doesn&#39;t use the KJV if they believe whatever version they use is a perfect pure word of God they will all admit they don&#39;t think so.  They believe all versions have mistakes.</p>

<p>If however you believe that there must be a perfect, purified, preserved word of God that is without error and then try to figure out what that would be, the KJV ends up being the obvious answer.  You can then compare verses between the KJV and any other version and see where Satan has influenced the translation to corrupt certain doctrine.</p>

<p>One good example of this is the NIV which removes &quot;Lucifer&quot; from Isaiah 14:12 and also give shim the title of Jesus Christ from Revelation 22:16 (Morning Star).</p>

<p>Then when you see these particular verses used in cults to prove something you see the full deception.  I&#39;ve had many people use the above verse to try to show me that Jesus Christ is the devil.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is take salient verses and compare them between the KJV and any other version.  The ones most changed deal with the deity of Jesus Christ, how easy it is to be saved, the sin of being deceitful/editing with God&#39;s word, adding an element of works to the gospel and things like that.</p>

<p>The best thing I&#39;ve ever seen that goes through the temporal stuff is a series called &quot;Advanced manuscript evidence by Peter S Ruckman.&quot;  This video has be scrubbed from the internet.  I think it can still be obtained on DVD.  Some of it is available in book form here:</p>

<p>part of a cabal to basically withhold announcing, discussing, presenting, describing, outlining or explaining the real artificial stuff out there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This made me think of something. There used to be a Swiss entrepreneur, Pascal Jaussi, who had, at the time SpaceX and other similar companies were starting to operate, decided to do the same thing. The company was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Space_Systems">Swiss Space Systems</a>. He managed to raise significant funding and was making great progress ...</p>

<p>... until he was abducted by unknown assailants, beaten, showered with a flammable liquid, and badly burned. He almost died. The company thereafter filed for bankrupcy and Pascal Jaussi was never heard of anymore.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a surely conspiracy  worthy of this sub. I&#39;ve never seen it mentionned however. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mundane, honestly. I started doing it spontaneously one day, unintentionally. I was asleep on the couch and I “got up” to go to bed, and at some point I realized I was out of my body. I did this for a few weeks unintentionally before I started doing it on purpose. I have only “traveled” around my house. Any time I’m doing it I can maintain it for awhile, unless I look at my physical body and then that kinda snaps me back into it. While I do it it’s like I have to not think too hard, or else I come out of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you still able to do it at will? Have you tried doing any sorts of experiments?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve thought that it would be interesting to write a computer program that just waits a few minutes then displays a random number on the screen. Run it, then go in the other room before the number appears, then use AP to go read the number. That way you can check it afterwards. </p>

<p>Would love to try it myself if I ever get around to learning AP</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t do it at will. When I was doing it unintentionally, it was always when I was in a half asleep state. If I want to do it on purpose I have to really quiet down and meditate for awhile, and then I can do it a little but I really struggle with it. It&#39;s easier for me to travel around when I do it unintentionally, and I stay in that state much longer. I haven&#39;t tried any experiments, because I don&#39;t really feel the need to prove anything to myself. I&#39;ve had a lot of spontaneous psychic experiences over the past few years, so when this whole AP thing started to happen I was like &quot;oh okay, another one for the pile.&quot; Perhaps one of these days I&#39;ll really hunker down to work practicing these things, but for now I just let it happen without putting too much effort in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll admit to a bit of jealousy - I&#39;ve only ever had this happen once, where I floated out of my bed and through part of the house. Think there was a voice that said something, can&#39;t seem to remember it though :(</p>

<p>Also, experimentation doesn&#39;t have to be to prove anything to anyone (though I probably would be doing it partly to confirm one way or the other). It can also be about things like finding where limitations are - am I perceiving more than I do in my body? Less? How are my senses effected? Are they expanded or reduced? Etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m definitely not prepared to do that kind of experimenting, but it would be really fascinating if I could. Honestly, any time I try or intend on doing anything psychic, I can&#39;t do it. I really struggle with maintaining the right mindset that allows for that kind of activity. Probably if I practiced meditation regularly, it would be easier.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that this &quot;alien&quot; Berserker race came to snuff out the noisy little Martians...</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Why did the &quot;alien&quot; Berserker race leave the lush and verdant Earth behind with it&#39;s burgeoning life that would, galactically speaking, in short order become the exact same upset as the noisy lil&#39; Martians ??</p>

<p>If they are on a crusade to eliminate competing species why did they not colonize the Earth and instead just leave it behind to develop into the exact same problem ?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you see how stupid that is ?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you see how it is nothing but a fantasy about evil aliens that are running around snuffing out all the competing life (but stupidly not leaving their own colonies or outposts in the wake of said destruction) ??</p>

<p>A dumb story for kids and people with too much time on their hands and too little critical thinking.</p>
