    <div class="md"><p>fox news is not half, they were not in hysterics during obama and you did not address the rest of my post - trump has been massively good for the american workers (and businesses) rather than international globohomo. he is not uniparty, and if enough trumpist candidates enter congress in the midterms, the wall will go up. immigration (illegal and otherwise) has been the top issue facing american workers for decades and trump is the first politician to finally, actually deliver some results on their behalf</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fox is not all of the right wing propaganda enterprise, they have essentially a monopoly on talk radio. </p>

<p>I do not agree that it has been a bonanza for workers. The tax cuts were focused at the top. TPP was not going to limit jobs it was mostly about tariff reduction and IP rights being upheld in overseas courts.</p>

<p>The whole economy argument is also weak. The trends were well established over the last decade, in fact one year in when Trumps policies have started to make an impact the market has moved sideways and inflation has started to accelerate wiping away any wage gains. </p>

<p>As for immigration his policies have had little real impact other than causing political messes. And anyone that thinks a wall will do anything but waste money is delusional. We already have walls in critical locations and post sensor balloons every 50 -100 miles that capture anything important from a security pov so a beautiful wall it is simply a waste and not worth any discussion.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>and the left has a near monopoly on televison, I wonder who has more reach</p>

<p>you are just wrong, the trade in services agreement which was part of TPP was specifically designed to open the american labor market in fields like nursing to all comers. since trump came into office unemployment has come down to the lowest level since 2008 and this is given the limited resources he has to deal with prosecuting employers hiring illegals</p>

<p>the current walls and balloons etc are useless when anyone stepping foot into the US can be confindent they will be ‘caught and released’. trump’s wall alone would be useless as well but it will be a powerful symbol for further changes. it can be manned and turned into ab actual effective barrier, where trespassers are deterred by deadly force</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unemployment was already trending down nothing Trump did impacted that at all except some H1B visa changes but I have not seen any data indicating that jobs were transferred to US skilled labor.</p>

<p>So TPP would make it easier for certified labor to be recognized in other countries. I agree that could impact the supply in certain fields but I think many would argue fields like nursing are under supplied and need additional labor inputs. And the opposite is valid too, an american license holder could go to a TPP country like Japan and Australia and get work without the red tape so it actually is a zero sum gain over the full labor market. </p>

<p>As for catch and release versus zero tolerance ... the former definitely does little to deter illegals but it certainly reduces cost of detainment and legal costs. The number I have seen indicated that the majority did follow up on mandated court appearances and the process worked albeit with some inefficiencies. </p>

<p>The current zero tolerance will end up costing way more to execute and will not change any of the outcomes. It just doesn&#39;t make fiscal sense.   </p>

<p>where did you see that number, because the number I have seen indicates that barely <em>any</em> show up for their court appearanes</p>

<p>detaining illegals in camps rather than &#39;catch and release&#39; will certainly deter some from attempting to enter the US illegally, but to do more, like removing the court process entirely and just deporting them on the spot (something they do with mexican nationals already) will require a trumpist congress. which will also allow to implement mandatory everify laws, raising wages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think it’s the labor transfers are misleading, those options are available. I do agree that merging labor pools would result in a near term wage risk but long term I believe it would be better. </p>

<p>The numbers I saw were from a report but I did misread the attendance rate it is between 20-30 percent. The deport rates are mostly the now shows while the rate i mistook was the show rate for consideration. </p>

<p>I am not opposed to quick processing but the real asylum seekers and non Mexican crossers are the problem from a legal POV. There can and should be better processes but Trumps route only does the opposite by lumping everyone into one camp. It will result in more underground hiding which is a bigger risk on the national security side imo. </p>

<p>The idea that camps are deterrents is flawed too. These people are fleeing from worse conditions so even in the case of being detained they are better off. The quick deport option only results in more attempts to cross an more money spent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>long term it would tend toward equalization of wages, and living conditions, something globalization takes advantage of, to the relative detriment of the working people of advanced countries. I cannot believe a supposed conspiracy regular is defending TPP, the most blatant globalization scheme I have seen in my life</p>

<p>and I disagree - the detainment is definitely a deterrent otherwise there would not have been such an outcry about it by the msm. many of these people are coming intending to send money back to their families. cannot do that while imprisoned. that is a great deterrent right there. there are also plenty of places south where life is preferrable to prison in the US. </p>

<p>but the key is to make sure that life in the country where they have no right to be is generally impossible for an illegal alien - mandatory everify so they cannot get jobs, denial of healthcare, denial of school for their children. when they know there is nothing for them here, they will stop coming</p>

<p>and the insta-deport option would be far less expensive than housing them or going through courts. travel costs money, they cannot just keep attempting to get in their entire lives. sure there is a cost to it for us, but that is the cost of protecting your country</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not defending TPP I am only stating what it is and would do with regard to those items. </p>

<p>I am a free market supporter but I have huge issues with corporations controlling governments. I would rather have representation by the people controlling these issues which imo we do not have right now, governments are corporate owned. My assertion is that trump is more of the same and just because half the msm doesn’t like him is not proof he is on my side. He has stated that no tariffs (a TPP outcome) was fine by him during his trade war negotiations with the G7. He is a champion of the other half of the billionaire investor class. That’s the shadow war that’s raging right now, billionaire versus billionaire and they are using derision to divide and control. </p>

<p>Aside from that I do want conditions to be better for all “normal” people in the world. Workers, business owners, etc. and that means some regulations to help bring up everyone including those in the states. Some factors of the TPP would do that but like you (I believe) I think it was crap and slanted to corporations and not worth signing. My left lean is centered only on this premise which doesn’t make me a Hillary supporter at all she is no different however the secondary and tertiary issues like equal rights guarantees are better imo than Trump that’s the only thing that I can use as a deciding factor between two folks that really don’t represent me. </p>

<p>That’s why I don’t think immigration controls are important in the grand scheme - it a low risk problem used to divide the people just like drugs, gay marriage, abortion, guns, among others that the powers really could care less about but use us to keep us out of the big important decisions around banking and business that’s solely the domain of corporations and the top tenth of a percent investor class. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>but what is he doing now - he’s <em>putting up</em> tarriffs to reduce the trade imbalance, and china is caving to him because access to the US market is such a prize they have been getting for free</p>

<p>the lack of care you express regarding immigration quite frankly puts you into the globalist camp. life is difficult enough for me and my family, both in regard to getting entry level jobs that are staffed with H1Bs, and semi-skilled ones that do not even hire americans anymore - like construction and stagnating wages. americans work more hours than ever because our labor market has been so open for so long. you would have me compete directly with indians, guatemalans and chinese, and bring my living standards to those living on rice and beans 20ppl to a room. you are a willing accomplice of global corporations. </p>

<p>hillary would have signed the TPP on her first day in office. in one of her private speeches she said she dreams of a “hemispheric common market with open borders”. you should have voted for her, she’d have you in a sweatshop working for pennies</p>

<p>trump is not perfect but he is the greatest political champion of the working man this country has seen in my lifetime. the shadow war raging is globalists vs trump, and I have great admiration for how he has managed to maneuver under constant fire and in the limited space afforded to him by a uniparty congress</p>

<p>I agree that the focus should be on improving the countries that produce refugees and asylum seekers as well as the casual laborer. But limiting the work force by restrictions on visas only encourage companies to leave the US manufacturing and design base. </p>

<p>the US became a superpower through a protectionist policy. tariffs will incentivize companies to hire where they also sell. it will raise prices to a degree but I would rather have my neighbors paid a living wage than save 50c on a trinket.</p>

<p>companies that can leave have already left. remember the TPP was focused on services, you cannot move these out from their point of consumption, which is why they are desperate to open the border legally and flood the US with cheap labor, pocketing the difference </p>

<p>you have been taught to hate trump so thoroughly you cannot admit that he is fighting to better your life</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I am sitting in my office coordinating Chinese suppliers importing the products my company makes and I can tell you it impacts costs all over the place. My firm is shitting bricks over the next round of tariffs that target electronic components and it will hit our margin and schedules as Chinese suppliers charge more and transit times increase due to additional customs audits. This shit has totally slowed up prototyping shipments and costs too. </p>

<p>And guess what we will either roll off people to offset the lost margin or raise prices. </p>

<p>It does hit us and China through lost sales and higher cost of goods sold. </p>

<p>a couple posts ago you brought up trump verbally agreeing with the free trade portion of TPP as a negative, then in the very next post you derided his tariffs. I hope you can get past your blind hate and think about some of the things I brought up in this conversation </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would love to have US suppliers. That Foxcon plant has been in the works for years (and I know being in the industry and having contacts close to the effort) well before Trump arrived. Just like the Global Foundries plant funded out of UAE too. Those decisions came from the realization that the US had given up too much chip level and high tech assembly and manufacturing to Asia. It’s good but sadly all the investors are foreign. </p>

<p>Tariffs did not drive those firms to build here it was strategic in other areas. Specifically the cost to manufacture large HD screens and the associated shipment costs. </p>

<p>this steel plant is reopening explicitly due to the trump tariffs

<p>ideally I’d like to see penalties for companies that do not hire where they want to sell, and benefits for those who do</p>

<p>think about what you are saying about the foxconn plant - that they are opening this plant because the US has given up too much high tech manufacturing. well foxconn certainly doesn not have any loyalty to the US. they’re not doing this out of sympathy. they are opening the plant either due to incentives offered by the US, or penalties. I don’t know which it is in their case, but in either case it is protectionism</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost no green field opportunities happen without tax welfare and give away subsidies- in the case of Foxconn that’s no different. But from a strategic point of view we need high tech assembly and basic foundry level factories back in the US. And that was a decision made under Obama and tech leaders to specifically reach out and engage high tech firms to manufacture here in the states. I am glad Trump is still doing the same type of things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the record I derided his methodology for tariffs. I understand the need and why they are used strategically to protect industries or specific companies or markets. I think in general they are bad and should be avoided. TPP was a plan to reduce them to zero but with lots of other baggage. </p>

<p>Trump negotiates only with one thing in mind dollars. That’s fine for a business (still short sighted) but not fine for a country. That’s what in my opinion he fails at. Time will tell the tale. </p>

<p>Unemployment will go up mostly because it can’t go down anymore. Wages will stagnate  and inflation will take off. It’s the Reagan era stagflation scenario building up. Classic protectionist conservative policy that enriches corporations in lieu of the worker. </p>

<p>unemployment is pretty low now, but there is a great amount of people who want work, but are not counted in the unemployment rate because they stopped looking for work. the labor participation rate has plenty of space to go up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Japan suffers from labor shortages and that’s caused tons of issues with immigration Ecuador and South America in general. I agree Germany has that benefit too but they both are high tech manufacturing and service exporters with a much smaller population than the US with stronger education systems. </p>

<p>If you are advocating for expansion of STEM opportunities and investing in education for the US then great but until then those comparisons are not going to work. </p>

<p>People are now reentering the work force which is good but we are “fully employed” so effective unemployment will begin to rise again especially if companies begin to lay off due to tariff trade war policies.</p>

<p>Unless we subsidize technical training and education the returning workers will exit again very soon. </p>

<p>the lack of care you express regarding immigration quite frankly puts you into the globalist camp. life is difficult enough for me and my family, both in regard to getting entry level jobs that are staffed with H1Bs, and semi-skilled ones that do not even hire americans anymore - like construction and stagnating wages. americans work more hours than ever because our labor market has been so open for so long. you would have me compete directly with indians, guatemalans and chinese, and bring my living standards to those living on rice and beans 20ppl to a room. you are a willing accomplice of global corporations. </p>
