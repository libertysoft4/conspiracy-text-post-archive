        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi guys! First post here! I&#39;m super excited to finally be able to post after waiting for 60 days!!! Here&#39;s something that&#39;s been on my mind:</p>

<p>The Rothschilds&#39;s, Hillary clintons daughter, celebrity sacrifices, architecture, and a bunch of other proof that Satan is worshipped by the most elite should make us wonder about God. </p>

<p>If these people who know more than we do (I figure through &quot;space exploration&quot; and private meetings) believe that there is a devil then there must be a god.</p>

<p>I think you already know where I&#39;m going with this: FLAT EARTH DOES NOT SEEM THAT CRAZY TO ME. </p>

<p>the bible suggests a firmament and water above it and below it. Since we have supposedly never been to space, we don&#39;t know that it is, in fact, air and not water</p>

<p>Photos of the other planets are all computer generated, even according to nasa. When independent researchers post photos of these planets using the most high tech gear they always look unclear and wavey, as if they&#39;re in water, </p>

<p>And why is it really that we aren&#39;t allowed to the &quot;center&quot; of Antarctica? Maybe the edge of the world? Where one would find the firmament?</p>

<p>(Some even believe there is more past Antarctica. That all of our &quot;space exploration&quot; is actually just the government searching for more life on this giant sheet of ice. That we are just a hot spot on it and that there must be more)</p>

<p>And the science behind flat earth doesn&#39;t seem all that bad. I mean, we don&#39;t have many professionals working to figure it out so we can&#39;t compare its complexity to a round earth&#39;s science. And if God exists then one thing being round and another thing being flat makes perfect sense. </p>

<p>Also, a lot of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; think that the media and government are trying to belittle us and make us feel dumb and small. They think this is done through fluoride, brainwashing/programming, etc... Would it be a stretch to think that they do this through basically telling us there is no God? (they tell us there is no God by making everything seem like it&#39;s rooted in science. The earth and evolution for example). This could be their plan since it is shown that less and less people believe in him. </p>

<p>If we don&#39;t believe in God then we feel there is nothing miraculous about life and we all just submit to science and &quot;whatever the expert says&quot;</p>

<p>It might be cognitive dissonance to believe one and not even consider the other. </p>

<p>Perhaps one can find life miraculous even if they don&#39;t believe in God. Isn&#39;t the mystery of who we are part of what makes it such a miracle?</p>

Science makes it seem like not much of a miracle. Everything has an explanation. Big Bang, evolution, etc.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t mean believing in God as in submitting to what he says, that would be a religion. I mean believing that there is something bigger out there, like an energy or something. Maybe a god but I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I tend to disagree. Anytime we discover something, we often have even more questions. And it&#39;s not the <em>how</em> that makes life miraculous, it&#39;s the <em>why</em>, which, when it come to the big bang, science cannot confirm why.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, I mistakenly inferred that from your post. My apologies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The unanswered questions still remains: Why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And a lot of people ask why but they&#39;re never interested enough to look into it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This I agree with. People can be consumed by other things, such as materialism, but perhaps it&#39;s because the why question can never fully be answered in a way that will satisfy people .You have to keep in mind that the people today grow up in a VERY different, and constantly changing world. Facts dominate (or have dominated) belief. And the answer to <em>why</em> requires faith, which many people aren&#39;t willing to give when a lot of other questions have been answered through fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some very good points here. But as you know any mention of flat earth gets you massively downvoted, which is a shame because it is as viable as there being space probes sent to Jupiter, or even Agartha which seem people seem to deem acceptable. But FE aside I wholeheartedly agree with the good god/creator sentiment and if you accept the concept of yin and yang in line with that then a being that is the opposite ie: satan, is possible. But hey, just a thought.. suppose the satanic figure is the good guy :) Anyway, interesting post. Thanks</p>

<p>that would be an opinion, as you yourself have just said, &quot;they&#39;re BASICALLY telling (I.e. they aren&#39;t telling but you have suspicions based on circumstantial evidence)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to write something really far fetched here, it is not my personal believe but this is what  i picked up in many videos / forums and whatnot:</p>

<p>Everything alive has the „godly“ and „conscious“ part in them. You can be positive or negative. Reality is far more then the 3 dimensions we exist in. If a being is positive enough and has mastered his mind he can somehow ascend into higher dimensions. As i understood it, there is a god that created this earth but also gods that created other worlds. Themselfes being created by other beings and so on until you finally reach the one god, the singularity, the whatver that compartmentalized himself snd gave consciousness to these parts, in order to experience creation and creativity and as a kind of test. The singularity god is like pure love/light/wisdom/positivity... in order for the compartmentalized parts to have free will, there is a dire need for an opposite force. So satan(any bad entity is there for a reason. They are there so humans can actively choose between the good and the evil while they exist in human form. In between earthly lives, the soul return to the earths soul (earth god?) and experience oneness. It is there that they can rejoin with their loved ones, access sll the memories from their live, their past lives and all the memories of the conscious-grid they belong to, if the others choose to share them. It is ones own choice to stay in this „afterlive“, „ascend to a higher dimension“ or „reincarnate“ again to test themselves again in an earthly live. While you incarnate on earth you normally dont have other memories but i think it ties in with some people being able to remeber past lives. For the bad entities: while in this afterlive, you can also actively choose to become a bad force, also serving the purpose of „god“ as the ultimate sacrifice to offer free will. Its merely just a role in their incarnation but also another test for themselves. Some fall to lover density dimension, some still ascend into higher dimension, even though it is harder for them to be all positive again afterwards. Demons are just lover density/ dimensional beings, wheres angels are higher dimensional beings or beings with higher frequency then us. </p>
