I&#39;m not a huge Trump fan, but he hasn&#39;t wrecked the bus yet, and hasn&#39;t embarrassed us anymore than Bush Jr. So can we just talk about something else? Ffs.</p>

It’s quite clear that Russia meddled in the election but whether or not Trump was involved is still unknown and right now there simply is no evidence. I’d say there is a better chance that Russia’s goal was to simply create chaos within the United States by trying to mess with the elections and look at us now...playing right into his hands.

As long as he&#39;s POTUS, there&#39;s NOTHING we can do about it. No matter how many propaganda, shared posts, videos to ridicule him, he would still be POTUS. We just have to move on.</p>

But that effort would be placed somewhere else productive. I&#39;ll leave it to the congress or lawyers to oust him. If I&#39;m invited to join a rally THAT WILL ELIMINATE him from his seat, yes I will join. But if none, I&#39;ll seat on my chair, feed my family, and work for my expenses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idgaf. It&#39;s likely fake news anyway. Throw them a dollar and they will say anything the media publishes what they are paid to publish. They are not reporting on these events for the better of the American people, they are doing it to make a buck. I really think there are some people that want this conspiracy to be true, and they will either fabricate the evidence, or pay for bullshit propoganda. People will believe most anything they read in the headlines., especially if they only read t headline. Seems to me like people are looking for any excuse they can to riot. Even here on reddit,  if you don&#39;t agree with the popular opinion, they become very aggressive and hostile. This downvoting is a primary reason why everybody seamingly has the same opinion about politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re far from the only person who just does not care about Trump/Russia election collusion.  </p>

<p>However, here&#39;s why you should.  If this behavior becomes normalized, and becomes seen as a valid political campaign tactic, the American political class will begin to sell out our country to foreign interests in the same manner it already sells out our country to corporate interests, and that is not good for America, right or left.  If you see the stuff going on with the NRA, it&#39;s already starting.</p>

<p>Like they haven&#39;t been for decades.    Isreal,  China,  Saudi,  Turkey,  many others have bought off many politicians.    Pay to play is a real thing.   WAKE UP.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I told the last political moron it doesn&#39;t fucking matter. Election Rigging didn&#39;t have anything to do with it.. Even if it did its too late. Trump got elected bc the general public is dumb af. The same reason Hillbot was on the ticket instead of Bernie. The same reason Trump will be re-elected.. The same reason people wanted Obamas birth-certificate.. Like I could go on and on and on.. It doesn&#39;t matter but while the idiots are chirping about this we literally could be talking about anything else interesting on this thread and in life.. But no.. we have to talk about devisive shit that just doesn&#39;t matter. Whatever.. this is why I don&#39;t vote.. this is why its back to video games.. The boomer was right about one thing this country is fucked.</p>
