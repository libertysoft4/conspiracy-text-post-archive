<p>You are completely mischaracterising what I said. I didn&#39;t deny its existence, I denied its value until it is available.</p>

<p>What is rational about taking someone&#39;s word at face value rather than considering the available information?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The evidence supports the DNC files being:</p>

<ul>
<li>The result of a leak who had physical access to the computer where the files were stored.</li>
<li>Explicitly <strong>not</strong> transferred remotely via the internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Analysis can be found here: <a href="https://theforensicator.wordpress.com/guccifer-2-ngp-van-metadata-analysis/">https://theforensicator.wordpress.com/guccifer-2-ngp-van-metadata-analysis/</a></p>

<p>Is it irrefutable proof? No, but it <em>strongly</em> supports physical access over remote access.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll be rapidly dismissed here, because that is the nature of reddit. Someone makes a vapid, uninformed comment and that is the end of that.</p>

<p>But any criticisms you see of the analysis you find here on reddit is likely addressed directly in the article linked above, or one of the few supporting follow-ups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is one reason to believe it, which is the high bar for evidence in America’s judicial system. This is a few steps above anonymously leaking news to the press; if you want to argue that there is no real evidence, because of these indictments you now need to accuse specific people not just of lying, but of fabricating evidence, which is an extremely serious allegation. If you think the judge or the grand jury are also deliberately issuing false indictments, that’s just a really explosive claim to make. Frankly it’s much more likely that the evidence is real.</p>

<p>No, it is more <strong>believable</strong>. There is a distinction. You are making an argument from incredulity.</p>

<p>If we are talking about what is likely, we should look at the evidence we have and how it lines up with the claims made.</p>

<p>The claims made within the indictments are contradicted by the <em>available</em> evidence.</p>
