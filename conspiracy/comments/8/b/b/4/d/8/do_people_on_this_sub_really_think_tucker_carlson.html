<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QesXS7ygY2g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QesXS7ygY2g</a></p>

<p>This guy is just another elite-approved (potentially Operation Mockingbird) planted disinformation agent in the media. Does having a Fox news link at the top of the page here really represent a non-partisan atmosphere? In my opinion, Tucker is the new &quot;false prophet&quot; of the media they are rolling out to try and appeal to us, and make &quot;conspiracy rhetoric&quot; seem exclusively a conservative talking point. </p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t aware by now, there is this orchestrated &quot;merge&quot; of conspiracy theorists into the conservative/right side of the left right paradigm. The election of Trump, the portrayal of him as an anti-establishment good guy, the use of alternative media gatekeepers like Alex Jones morphing into republican platforms, and a slew of other staged events and dirty tricks, to &quot;suck&quot; us into lowering ourselves within the left right paradigm.</p>

<p>Everything he&#39;s talking about, and the way he&#39;s going about it is being <em>allowed</em> to be talked about, because it&#39;s ultimately helping the establishment. Right now, they are incrementally allowing for some conspiracy rhetoric to hit the MSM, in hopes that it will disgust people and drive them away from the idea of a conspiracy, and using the conservative media to do this, brands us all as alt-right wackjobs, which is exactly part of the plan. </p>

<p>Tucker Carlson is preparing us for the post-Donald Trump world -- a world where Donald Trump starts the war, he is out of office, and the new &quot;more moderate&quot; government takes the benefit of the war they&#39;ve been drooling over for decades -- by both blaming Donald Trump and declaring that it was a mistake but now we have to finish it.</p>

<p>Carlson was born in San Francisco, California, the elder son of Richard Warner Carlson, a former Los Angeles news anchor and U.S. ambassador to the Seychelles, who was also president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and director of Voice of America. His mother is the former Lisa McNear Lombardi,[4] and his stepmother is the former Patricia Caroline Swanson, an heiress to the Swanson frozen-food fortune (daughter of Gilbert Carl Swanson and granddaughter of Carl A. Swanson) and a niece of Senator J. William Fulbright.[5] He has a brother, Buckley Swanson Peck Carlson. According to a profile in People magazine, &quot;Tucker and younger brother Buckley were raised in La Jolla, California, by their father and stepmother, Patricia, after their mother left home when Tucker was 6.&quot;[6] While living in La Jolla, California, Tucker briefly attended La Jolla Country Day School before relocating to the East Coast.</p>

<p>He attended St. George&#39;s School, a boarding school in Middletown, Rhode Island. After graduation, he studied at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, and graduated in 1992 with a B.A. in history.</p>

<p>That they&#39;re real?</p>

<p>That they happen all the time, and that thousands of people go to jail every day on conspiracy charges? Go look up the Department of Justice stats.</p>

<p>It&#39;s bizarre that you&#39;re stigmatizing consciousness of conspiracies while you&#39;re on a subreddit called <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost as if . . . as if . . .</p>

<p>As if you&#39;re not an organic member here. </p>

<p>(Nahhhhh! That couldn&#39;t possibly be the case, lol.) </p>

<p>But go on. . . .</p>

<p>Continue.</p>

<p>Keep telling the rest of us how &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;irrational&quot; we are. </p>

<p>Original poster, your title says, &quot;They are sucking the conspiracy theorists into Fox News and conservatism, all by design&quot;. You do realize that conspiracies actually exist, right?</p>

<p>Which part of this was unclear?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get what you&#39;re trying to say here, but I&#39;m sure as hell not going to derail the thread with some petty argument you&#39;re baiting me into. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have literally never seen a conservative cry in cognitive dissonance like this about liberals stumbling upon a valid conspiracy theory, as though that very fact alone were evidence of a <em>conspiracy against them</em>.  Nobody cries like a little baby when leftist environmentalists discover the harmful effects of pesticides or antibiotics.  Nobody gripes about cultural appropriation and claims to be under attack when a leftist discovers some conspiracy of government drug-smuggling.  For some reason, only you liberals have such a fragile world-view that you can&#39;t <em>possibly</em> agree with anyone politically different from you about anything conspiracy-related.</p>
