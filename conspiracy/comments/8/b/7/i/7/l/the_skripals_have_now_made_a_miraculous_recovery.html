        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay so i&#39;m usually a lurker and to be honest a lot of the stuff i read on here i disagree with but there are some good points that get raised and i like to look at all avenue&#39;s. This now just seems like absolute bollocks though..</p>

<p>So as most of us know on March 4th, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal were poisoned. Coincidentally only a 20 minute drive from Porton Down known for the Ministry of Defence&#39;s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl). Possibly one of the UK&#39;s most controversial military sites used for the development of chemical warfare for decades. This place is said to be the birth of the VX nerve agent although inevitably sold to and then massed produced by the US in exchange for thermonuclear technology(<a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/perspective/nerve-gas-simon-cotton.aspx">https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/perspective/nerve-gas-simon-cotton.aspx</a>). VX is one of the most widely known nerve agents and with it being more potent than sarin gas and far more dangerous than many other nerve agents was classed as a WMD in 1993. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX_(nerve_agent)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX_(nerve_agent)</a> ).</p>

<p>So with that in mind, we have two people, one which was a known double agent for Russia who became a UK citizen after an arranged spy swap between Russia and the UK and his daughter, a Russian citizen who was over visiting her father from Russia. They get found on a bench slumped over and unconscious. They get admitted to hospital, along with the first police officer on the scene who has also been &quot;contaminated&quot; with an, at this time unknown poison. I had a bit of trouble trying to find the exact date it was released to the public that the nerve agent Novichok was actually used, so if anyone can let me know that would be great. So while these people are in hospital and over what i remember being the course of the next 24-48 hours they discover the nerve agent Novichok was used on both Sergei and Yulia, as well as cross contamination with the police officer.</p>

<p>Now this to me is where things start to get really ridiculous. </p>

<p>Novichok was developed some time between 1971 and 1993 by the Soviet Union and Russia. in 1992 though two brave whistle blowers Vil Mirzayanov &amp; Lev Fyodorov blew the lid on the chemical weapons experimentation that was going on (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vil_Mirzayanov">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vil_Mirzayanov</a>). Now bear in mind that Vil Mirzayanov was one of the scientists that actually helped invent this chemical, so it&#39;s safe to say he will have an exceptionally good understanding of how it works and it&#39;s effects. </p>

<p>So during the process of Yulia, Sergei and the police officer Nick Bailey being in hospital. The UK government comes out and says it has evidence that Novichok has been used, it was clearly done by Russia as this is a Russian made chemical and the target was an ex Russian spy. They begin the condemn the country and ask for the world wide support from other countries and announce they are expelling 23 Russian diplomats due to them being &quot;intelligence officers&quot; for Russia (although they will have already knew this and were happy having them in the country before). Before we know it more than 20 different countries have backed the UK and are expelling Russian diplomats left, right and center, in less than a week since the announcement from the UK without any prior proof or letting Russia or the UN security council have a single sample of the Novichok nerve agent.</p>

<p>Back to Vil Mirzayanov, one of the inventors of Novichok then, during the process of the worldwide condemnation and the press trying to figure out more about the nerve agent they obviously go to the one man who would be in the know. Interviews are done and we get some quite harrowing information about this nerve agent. So Novichok is supposed to be more than 10X more powerful than VX which as mentioned above is classed already as a WMD. The one thing that stuck with me though was the fact he said the following: </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s torture,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s absolutely incurable.&quot; (<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-14/only-russia-could-be-behind-uk-poison-attack-toxin-inventor-says/9546298">http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-14/only-russia-could-be-behind-uk-poison-attack-toxin-inventor-says/9546298</a>). </p>

<p>He said: “There is no antidote to these agents.&quot;</p>

<p>“I can say with nearly 100 per cent certainty that if Skripal and his daughter are taken off life support, they will die, although they are now only technically alive.” (<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/hero-cop-hit-nerve-agent-12227778">https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/hero-cop-hit-nerve-agent-12227778</a>)</p>

<p>&quot;The damage it inflicts is practically incurable,&quot; </p>

<p>Asked this week about the March 4 poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, he was quoted as saying: &quot;These people are gone -- the man and his daughter. Even if they survive they will not recover.&quot; (<a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20180313-scientist-who-leaked-russias-novichok-conspiracy">http://www.france24.com/en/20180313-scientist-who-leaked-russias-novichok-conspiracy</a>).</p>

<p>A scientist who was developing the agent came into residual contact which left him critically injured and took ten days to recover consciousness after the incident. He lost the ability to walk and was treated at a secret clinic in Leningrad for three months afterwards. The agent caused permanent harm, with effects that included &quot;chronic weakness in his arms, a toxic hepatitis that gave rise to cirrhosis of the liver, epilepsy, spells of severe depression, and an inability to read or concentrate that left him totally disabled and unable to work.&quot; He never recovered and died in July 1992 after five years of deteriorating health. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent</a>).</p>

<p>Then on the 22nd of March Nick Bailey is released in perfect health and is free to go home. Now as of today the 10th of April Yulia has been released from hospital and taken to a safe house where we will probably never hear from her again and Sergei is set to make a recovery and be released shortly. </p>

<p>So to finally recap and apologise for the length of this! One of the most deadly nerve agents in the world has supposedly been used in a potentially public place to assassinate an ex Russian spy by Russia. The location of the attempted assassination was 20 minutes away from the UK&#39;s most widely known chemical weapons lab. Yet the NHS have managed to not only find out what has happened to them, got the non existent antidotes to work on them and manage to save three people. Two of which were at an almost 100% chance of death or life long impairment by the estimation of one of the inventors of said chemical. No one else has been infected and Russia and the UN still don&#39;t have samples of the nerve agent and now the UK can&#39;t confirm it came from there oh and also the UK wont let Russia speak to a Russian citizen (Yulia) regarding the alleged attack.</p>

<p>The fuck...?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what do you think about the fact that all the evidence shows that exposure to nerve agents such as this causes severe symptoms within seconds or minutes, rather than hours?</p>

<p>How were the Skripals able to spend hours enjoying their day <em>after</em> being exposed to this agent?</p>

<p>Another question... we hear talk about these people being in a coma for weeks... but:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both Mr and Ms Skripal remain in hospital <strong>under heavy sedation</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would doctors be sedating people who are in a coma? These people woke up not because the effects of a nerve agent wore off, but because the doctors stopped sedating them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where are you getting your information? Also, did the Skripals  go back to their home between the time of leaving the pub and going to park bench? I can&#39;t clarify that.</p>

<p>Exposure time: I spoke to one scientist, Andrei Zheleznyakov, who had been exposed to a minute amount of Novichok in a lab accident five years prior. He staggered out after the mishap, his vision, as I wrote, “seared by brilliant colors and hallucinations.” Zheleznyakov never fully recovered, and he died shortly after I interviewed him. (From the WaPo writer that interviewed him in Russia)</p>

<p>Concentration: Novichok agents have a higher density than air and will therefore tend to collect in low-lying areas. No other information is available regarding their persistency.</p>

<p>Also, numerous articles I&#39;ve read describe the nerve agent as &quot;persistent&quot; for a short time, but not much is known. So I&#39;m curious as to where you are getting your information.</p>

<p>Look at Litivenko and the agony he died in. I&#39;m gonna link his statement, in part, because it&#39;s so poignant. A message to counter what was sent. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But as I lie here I can distinctly hear the beating of wings of the angel of death.</p>

<p>I may be able to give him the slip but I have to say my legs do not run as fast as I would like.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, that this may be the time to say one or two things to the person responsible for my present condition.</p>

<p>You may succeed in silencing me but that silence comes at a price. You have shown yourself to be as barbaric and ruthless as your most hostile critics have claimed.</p>

<p>You have shown yourself to have no respect for life, liberty or any civilised value.</p>

<p>You have shown yourself to be unworthy of your office, to be unworthy of the trust of civilised men and women.</p>

<p>You may succeed in silencing one man but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chemical weapons are used not because they&#39;re lethal, but to send a message. A painful one.</p>

<p>Look at Litivenko and the agony he died in. I&#39;m gonna link his statement, in part, because it&#39;s so poignant. A message to counter what was sent. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But as I lie here I can distinctly hear the beating of wings of the angel of death.</p>

<p>I may be able to give him the slip but I have to say my legs do not run as fast as I would like.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, that this may be the time to say one or two things to the person responsible for my present condition.</p>

<p>You may succeed in silencing me but that silence comes at a price. You have shown yourself to be as barbaric and ruthless as your most hostile critics have claimed.</p>

<p>You have shown yourself to have no respect for life, liberty or any civilised value.</p>

<p>You have shown yourself to be unworthy of your office, to be unworthy of the trust of civilised men and women.</p>

<p>You may succeed in silencing one man but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alexander Litvinenko</p>

<p>An old batch that had lost potency?</p>

<p>A non-direct hit by whomever administered it?</p>

<p>A gust of wind blowing in the opposite direction?</p>

<p>Some other type of user error?</p>

<p>Initial reports of effectivness were over-hyped?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t automatically disprove your theory, it just makes it more suspicious, which is what I said. Of course there is a chance that the Russian assassin screwed up, it just makes the whole conspiracy theory against the Russians even less likely than it already was.</p>
