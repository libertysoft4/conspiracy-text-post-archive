    <div class="md"><p>Spread awareness. </p>

<p>If you are spiritually inclined and believe, like I do that humanity in its collective makes up one field. That we share a collective unconscious, as even Jung suggested as well as many mystical teachings, that we are a collective in the psychic and noetic sense, not only in the ways that seem physically obvious. </p>

<p>If you subscribe to that theory, there is plenty you can do. If that is true, then all of your thougts, emotions, decisions, your psyche,  directly influences the psyche of all humans,  or even furher, all inhabitants of this planet, including plants and animals. Thus it is prudent to let go of fear, anger, hate, guilt, remorse, grief....any pain you may encounter within. Thus it is prudent to meditate, to journal, to introspect, to engage in contemplative practices, to make the right decisions in life, those that lead you to greater happiness and freedom. Thus it is prudent to be kind to both yourself and all of life you encounter. It is wise to take care of not only your mental and emotional , but your physcial health as well, as all of them are interrelated.</p>

<p>It is prudent to wake the fuck up, becaue humanity is awakening with you.</p>

<p>It means that as we wake up, humanity wakes up. As we move to peace and become.more conscious, the rest of humanity does as well. It means we all share a collective field, a collective psyche and every being has an influence on this field. </p>

<p>That is why fear and manipulation through media is so effective.  Not only because people are tricked and herded through the information on the physcial level, but becaue the fear and brainwashing comes into our collective psyche and influences us all. That is why one person can start a revolution, becaue they are just the trigger for the collective psyche&#39;s keg of gunpowder. </p>

<p>We need to evolve, but many forget that we primarily we need to evolve and become conscious within. That will spring into positive action but it will also <em>directly influence the collective human psyche</em>. And that is how we can be saved, how we can save the world when all seems lost.</p>

<p>A collective unconscious? </p>

<p>If so, what do you see as the root of it? (in the opinion of Carl Jung)?</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>I reserve judgement on Jung&#39;s Red Book, as I haven&#39;t read it myself. It&#39;s only a stage of him, anyway (and a rather &#39;psychotic one&#39; as seen by his contemporaries).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said, thank you. Looks like I&#39;m doing everything I can then, by focusing my energy on spreading love and light. </p>

<p>I really enjoyed the perspective Terrence McKenna puts on this, he says something to the effect of don&#39;t focus our energy on waking people up. It&#39;s frivolus. He says the only thing we can do is foucus on on own awakenings, and the rest will follow in time as we plunge deeper into our own awakend states.</p>

<p>Keep spreading that light friend, it&#39;s much appreciated.</p>

<p>End-times in my book simply means we are living at the end of an era and the current paradigm has to change before humanity is truly free and truly in touch with the Divine. But the end times don&#39;t have to mean WW3 or a major apocalypse. </p>

<p>We can get right not only with the infinite feedom and love that is God, but with ourselves and each other, while we also need to carry that divinity into the world. </p>

<p>Just my view on it of course.</p>

It didnt just fuck with the enemy troops but the american, australian and other forces.  Those agent orange affected areas had huge amounts of people in them fighters and civilans... to say it was just used against plants is a real innacurate thing... perhaps thats what the person selling the chemical to the government said but its certainly not how it was used in practice.

<p>What is Zyklon B?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zyklon B was a brand name for a product developed by a German company, a pesticide  intended to be used as a fumigant to treat commodities and structures. The active ingredient being hydrogen cyanide.</p>

<p>Zyklon B was, we are told, later misused by the Nazi Regime as an agent to murder countless people who had been locked in confined spaces where the agent was then released, killing them.</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide, the product of engine exhaust, was reportedly used in for the same diabolical purpose: as an agent of execution/ murder in confined spaces.</p>

<p>Trapping victims in confined spaces was essential for the efficacy of these agents. In open spaces, they are ineffective for such purposes, as they disperse too rapidly, and hydrogen cyanide, being lighter than air, quickly rises into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>For military purposes, or attacking civilian populations, Zyklon B is no more a &quot;chemical weapon&quot; than is simple engine exhaust.</p>

<p>Yes, they were. I did not say otherwise.</p>

<p>As an agent of execution, not as a weapon of war, deployed against military or civilian populations in a battlefield scenario, as Sarin, mustard gas, and chlorine have been used. This is how &quot;chemical weapons&quot; are defined in the present context.</p>

<p>Rope is used as a tool for execution, and to murder, including captured enemy combatants. But It is not a &quot;weapon of war&quot;, per se.</p>

<p>No, I am differentiating weapons / agents used in <em>executions</em> (such as Zyklon B) from those used in battlefield scenarios (Sarin, mustard gas, etc), because the former is not and never have been used as such, and is therefore an irrelevant distraction <strong><em>in the context</em></strong> of this discussion.</p>

<p>Zyklon B / hydrogen cyanide is virtually ineffective unless deployed in a tightly confined space against victims who are trapped within. It is not a weapon of war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I emphatically agree that this is a setup. I&#39;ve watched a lot of Assad interviews - I think he&#39;s doing the best job that anyone could under the sort of outside pressure he&#39;s getting.

<p>But I just have no idea what&#39;s at the end of this agenda to overthrow Syria and Iran. I guess just securing US oil for the longterm or maybe there&#39;s something else. It all feels very desperate from the West - like &quot;if we don&#39;t do this, our entire establishment will collapse&quot;. Maybe it will.</p>

<p>Assad is providing the same service that Saddam Hussein did: stabilizing his particular region and knocking down terrorists</p>

<p>As bad as Hussein was, he hated terrorists just as much and his death, on top of the oil argument, served the Elite in destabilizing the Iraq/Iran region and allowing ISIS to form.

<p>&quot;By now, it is well established that Democrats and Republicans have starkly different views of the war in Iraq -- the vast majority of Republicans support the war, and Democrats are overwhelmingly opposed.&quot;</p>

<p>Damn those war hungry Liberals!</p>

<p>I realize that the new generation of Trump supporter Republicans likely do not want to think of themselves as having joining and supporting the hawk party, but that is simply the reality of the Republican party. Also, the idea that Trump is somehow anti-war is so ridiculously absurd that is makes my head spin that people on REDDIT CONSPIRACY bought that baloney. </p>

<p>Your comment history shows this to be untrue, at least on a superficial level, since all you do is attack trump/GOP while defending and apologizing for democrats.</p>

<p>So that raises the question of why you would lie about your ideological leanings? What do you have to gain by falsely presenting yourself as something you arent?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually old enough to remember the 90s Republican health plans when they were happening, and they are basically the ACA. I&#39;m honestly disgusted by comments from some of my friends (also Republicans) when they talk about the ACA, when these same people were broadly in support of the Republican proposals then (and when asked about details of the policy are broadly in support of it). I think if you go back to around the time I created this account you&#39;ll see that I went from lukewarm Clinton support, to what is basically full on support as a strange non-fact based narrative has evolved around them (particularly in far left and far right wing circles) where they are singularly evil, terrible, powerful people that just isn&#39;t supported by logic. I voted HW in 92 and Dole in 96. Also one of the reasons I have left the Republican party is the insistence of ideology over pragmatism (the reverse used to be true). </p>

<p>I&#39;m old enough to remember the bipartisan smear against third parties which happened in the 90s. I guess we can thank your boy Trump for helping torpedo the Reform party.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when they talk about the ACA,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had a pre existing condition which I got in 2009. It was so bad my insurance company (bcbs) dropped me. </p>

<p>I had to pay for ongoing treatment every week, which ended up costing me 1000+ a month, out of pocket.</p>

<p>I was very much in favor of the ACA on paper, since I thought it would help me. Here&#39;s what happened: the I seance companies simply created special &quot;pre existing condition plans&quot; (at a special marked up rate) that sucked ass and covered nothing. Not a single aspect of my physical therapy or follow up surgery maintenance was covered. I&#39;m in So cal, fyi.</p>

<p>So, I was given the boon of having to pay a special, extra high premium for the <em>privilege</em> of getting my condition &quot;covered&quot;... when, in reality, the plans didnt even cover my out of pocket costs.</p>

<p>Essentially, I was required to pay a premium I wasn&#39;t paying before (Or pay a &quot;tax&quot;), on top of continuing to pay all my medical costs out of pocket...</p>

<p>Really benefited people with pre existing conditions, huh? I know several people in the same or similar boats. I actually don&#39;t personally know a single person who benefited from the ACA.</p>

<p>Anyways, thanks for that. Thanks for the corporate gift at my detriment. I&#39;m still paying PT out of pocket, btw, 8 years later.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, I saw that. I also saw you trying to pretend that you&#39;re a former Republican. This is why I encourage anyone reading this to look and evaluate for themselves, and ask why someone would misrepresent their political leanings in such a way.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They aren&#39;t &quot;singularly&quot; evil. They are just another piece of our system which has been completely corrupted by the influence of money.</p>

<p>I love that you say you voted dole in 96. You, the super ACA promoter guy, voting for the candidate who wanted to slash social programs, including Medicare? The guy who openly bragged about being one of the few congressmen who voted against medicare because he &quot;knew it wouldnt work&quot;. </p>

<p>And then you distanced yourself fro republicans? After <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/china1.htm">this</a>? You&#39;re old enough to remember that, I&#39;m assuming. Going to the DNC following 96 would be akin to someone deciding to &quot;go GOP&quot; because of Meullers investigation.</p>

<p>Yikes. Well I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t need to tell you the issues with that one since you&#39;re a good faith user of this subreddit, which a genuine interest in popular conspiracy theories... right?</p>

<p>People call this an <em>establishment</em> investigation, and they arent wrong. What they dont realize is that Trump is an establishment player, and buy into the outsider LARP.</p>

<p>Already was.</p>

<p>But you think your situation is worse?</p>

<p>Yes. The premiums I paid for PCIP plans was absurd, and they did nothing for me, so it was money I wasted thinking I&#39;d get some help with my PT and my surgeries. In 2014 I was given a 16-month grace period in which i couldn&#39;t get coverage for my condition, but after which i would be covered. Until I wasn&#39;t. Since I can work with my injury, it&#39;s non-essential, and isn&#39;t covered. I&#39;ve made 3 appeals with hospitals and surgeons to this company with no avail.</p>

<p>Now, please, tell me how much h better off I am for having forked over all this money to absolutely no benefit?</p>

<p>Yes, but it is obvious that your story is a lie for 2 reasons right here because that would have invalidated you from a &quot;Pre-Existing Condition Plan&quot;.</p>

<p>The rest of the story (if true, which agian it pretty obviously isn&#39;t) just makes you sound like a really dumb consumer.

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. I was eligible for PCIP due to having a 6 month lapse, and having been denied plans on the basis of my condition. The fact i had insurance prior to this doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>Why are you saying I didn&#39;t need it? Just because I was able to afford it? This is the same logic currently being used by the insurance companies right now- you worked for this many years with your fucked up condition, therefore therapy and surgeries aren&#39;t essential. Good company man, aren&#39;t you.</p>

<p>I just explained how it did, after the 2014-2015 Grace period. Only problem is that they still won&#39;t cover it, cause it isn&#39;t essential. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>yes you are in a better situation still, because the insurance plan that you (obviously didn&#39;t, but you konw for the sake of this fantasy we&#39;re doing) had wouldn&#39;t have covered anything serious going forward/ would have had hard capped limits that made any such coverage&#39;s useless.</p>

<p>The only medical expenses I have had in the last 10 years have been in regards to my ankle, and it&#39;s all been, and still is, out of pocket, regardless of the fact that I&#39;m now &quot;covered&quot;.</p>

<p>1 - the emails revealed that the DMV conspired to hurt the Sanders campaign. You hate Sanders and love clinton, though, so I can imagine why youd choose to pretend they didnt.</p>

<p>2- it&#39;s Obama apologetics, plain and simple. You asked what makes you appear to be left. I don&#39;t really know who would so passionately (and repeatedly) defend democrats without identifying as left.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re on here repeatedly promoting the ACA, Obama&#39;s great legacy. This is just one instance in a pattern of defending Democrats, which appears to be your MO</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4- It&#39;s literally just a link to her campaign funding, I guess facts make you a lefty?</p>

<p>I mean, do you deny that this is apologetics for Clintons campaign financing? The only way you win this one is if I&#39;m a Trump supporter, and I&#39;m quite the opposite. As the numbers you linked show; the money flowed into Clintons camp at a far greater rate than into Trumps. Clearly this is just pro-clinton/Democrat narrative pushing on your part; no different than a trumper pushing pro-trump narratives. This is especially clear when you consider that you ignored my link earlier showing that Clinton has <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/top.php?display=M">contributed more to the revolving door</a> than any other congressman or candidate.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say that defending either one of those hyperpartisan cesspools in favor of the other males you pretty clearly a partisan. They are both nothing but botnet-driven hives of propoganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also saying I was ashamed of Clinton while he was in office</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t say that, though. You used the word shameful in reference to &quot;an episode&quot;, not Clinton or his actions. You then described his handling of said shameful episode with &quot;dignity and respect for the office&quot;... pretty glowing terms for someone you apparently <em>arent</em> defending.</p>

<p>8- you were in an anti-trump sub promoting the ACA... and that makes you, what, right? Come on, man. Again, people can evaluate this stuff for themselves and come to their own conclusions, but it seems obvious to me that you are very much in favor of left wing politicians and their legacies.</p>

<p>9- no, the defense of democrats does. &quot;Is that the D&#39;s fault, too?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus man, half of these are literally just links to hard data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet you ignored the hard data I linked earlier on Clinton. So, you knowingly choose to acknowledge <em>only</em> data which supports democrats, while ignoring data which may paint them in a bad light. Your partisan tendencies look pretty clear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People like you are a lot of the reason I left the Republican party</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I vote third party. In my life, I&#39;ve never once registered or voted republican, and have voted Democrat twice. Most of my top comments are anti-trump/GOP.</p>

<p>Im finding it increasingly impossible to believe anything you say.</p>

<p>No, my bar is don&#39;t be a partisan. If a guy is always defending Trump and attacking democrats on this sub, he&#39;s a partisan, too. If he says, &quot;im not actually right wing&quot;, that&#39;s weird, too.</p>

<p>Took the words out of my mouth</p>

<p>What you&#39;re missing here is that we&#39;ve always been at war. There is an attempt to make it <strong>seem</strong> as if there&#39;s a group of people who want war and a group of people that want peace, and that we can choose between them.</p>

Revolutions, catastrophes, and wars might multiply but so long as one brilliant human scientist survives, the species can survive, and beyond that, without humanity the rest of the universe would continue on to new adventures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well,  your question makes it absolutely clear that you haven&#39;t bothered to look into it AT ALL. </p>

<p>Why should I bother explaining something to you when you&#39;re  simply too lazy to care?  If you don&#39;t bother to educate yourself on a issue, and just want to spout MSM propaganda,  nothing I explain for you will matter.   </p>

<p>Why? Because it is contradictory information,  and you&#39;ve already demonstrated that you actively ignore anything which compromises your false reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but the question is have you been paying attention? The only justifiable way for the us to overtly  go into a country uninvited is to go after chemical weapons or terrorists, Assad and Putin are also aware of this fact, also they are not retarded, they reached the top of their respective countries dominance hierarchy, Putin by his own doing, Assad inherited the position from his father, if you turn on any western media channel all you see is what kind of monsters they are and how they probably kill their own people personally.. do you remember the last 2 &quot;chemical attacks&quot; ? And what preceded them ? Obama had his line in the sand and the first attack was like a day later, then the 2013 attack happend, and according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nearly-1500-killed-in-syrian-chemical-weapons-attack-us-says/2013/08/30/b2864662-1196-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_story.html?utm_term=.16e3bc6dfcd1">this Washington post article</a> the us government has &quot;overwhelming evidence&quot; on Assad being responsible <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/08/syria-chemical-weapons-not-assad-bild">yet 5 years later we are still waiting to see any of that</a>, and not a week after Trump declares he wants to get out of Syria the exact same thing happens as in 2013...</p>

<p>I highly recommend watching the documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fny99f8amM">Hypernormalisation</a>, as it provides a ton of explanations behind Assad&#39;s actions. </p>

<p>He believes (arguably correctly) that all of the problems in the middle east stem from the US preventing his father from creating a unified Arab nation in the 70&#39;s, and he hates the US for it. These things could just as well keep happening right when we &#39;draw a line&#39; or &#39;declare we want to get out&#39;, because Assad just DGAF and is showing he really doesn&#39;t care what the US says. He knows we won&#39;t actually do anything because we don&#39;t want a MAD war with Russia, and he just doesn&#39;t care and isn&#39;t afraid to show it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That theory makes more sense than a false flag. The US has no substantive goals in Syria now that ISIS is defeated. There’s no benefit to regime change given the protection levied over Assad by Russia. Remember that Saddam had no one protecting him. That’s why he was vulnerable. Assad is not vulnerable. And there’s also the very real possibility that it was a mid level commander that unilaterally decided to use the chemical weapons. That’s far more likely and requires less far flung assumptions than a false flag. Sometimes dictators and their underlings do crazy shit. Is that so hard to believe?</p>

<p>More than that, is Russia credible at all? They lied about invading Ukraine. They lied about the downing of the Malaysian airliner. Putin himself came to power in what was almost certainly a false flag event. Idk how <em>anyone</em> can discredit the US narrative without also discrediting the Russian narrative. Furthermore, did everyone forget that France is corroborating the narrative that the Assad regime committed the attack? Did everyone forget that France was staunchly opposed to the war in Iraq? Is French credibility diminished just because they agree with the US? Wtf even is this timeline? </p>

<p>All right. But just saying &quot;why would Assad gas his own people, he&#39;s winning right now and it only gives the West a Casus Belli&quot; isn&#39;t looking at it from all sides.</p>

<p>Look, I haven&#39;t seen the evidence so I won&#39;t make my judgement about what happened but there is a reason why Assad would do it. He feels that he&#39;s invincible or at least heavily protected by Russia.</p>

<p>He allegedly used it in 2013, US did nothing. Then last year the retaliation was one bombed Airfield that as far as I know was back up and running shortly after.</p>

<p>Assad knows that no one wants WW3, so maybe he doesn&#39;t fear the response from the West?</p>

<p>And why he used it specifically? There are still pockets of rebels which don&#39;t seem to be giving up. They hide in the general population and a gas attack spreads much more fear and defeatism in the ranks of the rebels and sympathisers than conventional weaponry would.</p>

<p>That is looking at it from both sides in my opinion.</p>

<p>Well I just asked you for some. And you tell me to read posts on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware that some or most people on here don&#39;t believe the US or western narrative and are more inclined to the Russian one.</p>

<p>Russia and Assad deny, Trump, May, Macron suggest or outright say there is evidence. I haven&#39;t seen it so if I want to form an opinion I have to speculate, as do you I suppose.</p>

<p>No <em>public</em> evidence. I don&#39;t have access to military satellites. How do <strong>you</strong> know there isn&#39;t any evidence, that is just classified? We&#39;ve put 4 super satellites up over the last couple years (Top secret mega payload satellites) that we&#39;ve never been told what they were, the X37B has delivered multiple &#39;surveillance&#39; satellites up.</p>

<p>This is the third time we’ve been on the verge of conflict. The two previous times (previous [false flag carried out by the deep state] Syria chemical weapons attack and North Korea) ended in not only no conflict but possible denuclearization of North Korea the previous Syria chemical attack resulted in Trump bombing a base that supposedly had their chemical weapons but IMO this video explains that situation perfectly <a href="https://youtu.be/4VCgU1v0c3I">https://youtu.be/4VCgU1v0c3I</a> TL:DW- Trump bombed an empty base in Syria (with Assad’s permission) to destroy the Deep States narrative that Trump is in cahoots with Putin. </p>

I will never tell anyone else that my country has not fucked up but I will say that for us to go to war over it is pathetic and those that want it just haven’t woken up yet...this change we all want will come but it’s very slow.
I also hear where you are coming from, and I do not agree at all with our foreign policy, but civilization has always been a mess...honestly we the rate we are going if we don’t put down our pitch forks and just simply say I would rather go get high that to go war, and everyone did that and I mean everyone we could change the system...it’s like I say about out shitty internet and phone services where I live...if everyone just did not give into the ridiculous prices they would change but unfortunately we all have been raised to serve the master...all’s I’m saying is we are all on planet earth which is a rocket ship hurling through fucking space and none of this shit matters.</p>

<p>Americans should indeed know that people are most probably going to judge them for their government&#39;s actions. </p>

<p>You&#39;re a democratic nation after all and you&#39;re the ones who bring your bloodthirsty leaders into power. You do have a responsibility to the world since American leaders are totally incapable of minding their own business and keep fucking up the rest of the world. So, yes you shoulder some of that responsibility. Sorry but you can&#39;t keep burying your head in the sand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve sadly noticed that many can&#39;t take any critcism. </p>

<p>A person doesn&#39;t even have to travel all that much to know how much damage the US administration is doing to the world. They can learn all that from the comfort of their homes. So it&#39;s either laziness, arrogance or ignorance. Probably a mixture of all of the above. Honestly most of the time, it feels like some Americans are just drunk with power and simply don&#39;t give a shit about other countries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re defending a possible war. That&#39;s not pro-war to you? I do agree that my comment was provocative but it was because it was in response to another person who was saying that not attacking would only benefit Russia. </p>

<p>&quot;Right, so ask, who does America not attacking benefit?
Russia.</p>

<p>Full disclosure, I do support attacking Assad, because, tbh, he has killed about 500,000 people and I would love to see him pay for his atrocities, even chemical weapons aside. I&#39;d say I feel weird agreeing with Trump on this, but I have a feeling he&#39;s going to wimp out. He&#39;s already wavering. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Who the fuck isn&#39;t sure who used the chemical weapons? The only people with chemical weapons used them. Fucking Assad. If a country uses weapons of mass destruction international law is explicitly clear. We bomb the shit out of them. The idea behind the bombing would be to deter the future use of chemical weapons. If they continue to use them after maybe it is time to over through the Assad regime, maybe it is time to look at Russian aggression as escalating, and maybe it is in the national security interest of all NATO nations to kick the shit out of Russia and destroy the mob that runs it. Putin&#39;s goal is the reestablishment of the USSR (maybe a little less red this time), we need to be willing to prevent that by any means.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, one guy on Fox News doesn&#39;t support intervention and have now concluded that the left is the pro-war side. </p>

<p>How about a quote from Trump?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart!” You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!&quot;</p>

<p>I never said Republicans weren&#39;t, that&#39;s an assumption YOU made. Of course NeoCons are warhawks, that&#39;s a given. Yet modern Liberals are squealing like excited little girls at idea of giving Assad, &quot;what he deserves&quot;.</p>

<p>I did, and I heard Trump talk (ignoring what he said about going after &quot;ISIS&quot;) he said a lot of the right things, but then again, so did Obama... talk is cheap.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t say a political party is anti-war when they spend decades trying to get us to invade and stay in Syria. It&#39;s not how it works, it&#39;s as &quot;war free&quot; as Obama was &quot;scandal free&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually old enough to remember the 90s Republican health plans when they were happening, and they are basically the ACA. I&#39;m honestly disgusted by comments from some of my friends (also Republicans) when they talk about the ACA, when these same people were broadly in support of the Republican proposals then (and when asked about details of the policy are broadly in support of it). I think if you go back to around the time I created this account you&#39;ll see that I went from lukewarm Clinton support, to what is basically full on support as a strange non-fact based narrative has evolved around them (particularly in far left and far right wing circles) where they are singularly evil, terrible, powerful people that just isn&#39;t supported by logic. I voted HW in 92 and Dole in 96. Also one of the reasons I have left the Republican party is the insistence of ideology over pragmatism (the reverse used to be true). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That theory makes more sense than a false flag. The US has no substantive goals in Syria now that ISIS is defeated. There’s no benefit to regime change given the protection levied over Assad by Russia. Remember that Saddam had no one protecting him. That’s why he was vulnerable. Assad is not vulnerable. And there’s also the very real possibility that it was a mid level commander that unilaterally decided to use the chemical weapons. That’s far more likely and requires less far flung assumptions than a false flag. Sometimes dictators and their underlings do crazy shit. Is that so hard to believe?</p>

<p>More than that, is Russia credible at all? They lied about invading Ukraine. They lied about the downing of the Malaysian airliner. Putin himself came to power in what was almost certainly a false flag event. Idk how <em>anyone</em> can discredit the US narrative without also discrediting the Russian narrative. Furthermore, did everyone forget that France is corroborating the narrative that the Assad regime committed the attack? Did everyone forget that France was staunchly opposed to the war in Iraq? Is French credibility diminished just because they agree with the US? Wtf even is this timeline? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You skipped the first one.</p>

<p>1 - the emails revealed that the DMV conspired to hurt the Sanders campaign. You hate Sanders and love clinton, though, so I can imagine why youd choose to pretend they didnt.</p>

<p>2- it&#39;s Obama apologetics, plain and simple. You asked what makes you appear to be left. I don&#39;t really know who would so passionately (and repeatedly) defend democrats without identifying as left.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Asking how is the ACA hurting Americans makes me a lefty?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re on here repeatedly promoting the ACA, Obama&#39;s great legacy. This is just one instance in a pattern of defending Democrats, which appears to be your MO</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4- It&#39;s literally just a link to her campaign funding, I guess facts make you a lefty?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, do you deny that this is apologetics for Clintons campaign financing? The only way you win this one is if I&#39;m a Trump supporter, and I&#39;m quite the opposite. As the numbers you linked show; the money flowed into Clintons camp at a far greater rate than into Trumps. Clearly this is just pro-clinton/Democrat narrative pushing on your part; no different than a trumper pushing pro-trump narratives. This is especially clear when you consider that you ignored my link earlier showing that Clinton has <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/top.php?display=M">contributed more to the revolving door</a> than any other congressman or candidate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5- Reciting the top 3 politics stories and the top 3 The-D stories to show that while both are bad 1 is categorically more bad makes me a lefty?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say that defending either one of those hyperpartisan cesspools in favor of the other males you pretty clearly a partisan. They are both nothing but botnet-driven hives of propoganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also saying I was ashamed of Clinton while he was in office</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t say that, though. You used the word shameful in reference to &quot;an episode&quot;, not Clinton or his actions. You then described his handling of said shameful episode with &quot;dignity and respect for the office&quot;... pretty glowing terms for someone you apparently <em>arent</em> defending.</p>

<p>8- you were in an anti-trump sub promoting the ACA... and that makes you, what, right? Come on, man. Again, people can evaluate this stuff for themselves and come to their own conclusions, but it seems obvious to me that you are very much in favor of left wing politicians and their legacies.</p>

<p>9- no, the defense of democrats does. &quot;Is that the D&#39;s fault, too?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus man, half of these are literally just links to hard data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet you ignored the hard data I linked earlier on Clinton. So, you knowingly choose to acknowledge <em>only</em> data which supports democrats, while ignoring data which may paint them in a bad light. Your partisan tendencies look pretty clear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People like you are a lot of the reason I left the Republican party</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I vote third party. In my life, I&#39;ve never once registered or voted republican, and have voted Democrat twice. Most of my top comments are anti-trump/GOP.</p>

<p>Im finding it increasingly impossible to believe anything you say.</p>
