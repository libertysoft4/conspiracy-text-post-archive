We must indeed have Democratic power. The Republicans are a front. Who&#39;s actually behind it we will never find out. They are too deeply entrenched. It has gone too far. Bush then Clinton then Bush then Obama has completely erased any residual resistance to the Takeover. America is done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, exactly. The republicans were forcing Boehner out, and there was about to be an outright civil war within the party about who to replace him. Paul Ryan was the only one they could semi agree on, so they begged him to come on. And Paul Ryan saw that $500,000 check from the Koch&#39;s coming his way, so he finally agreed. Now, that he got the money, he cashed out, and has no more reason to stay.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see him in about a decade or so running for president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what you want to focus on. It&#39;s not people I don&#39;t like - it&#39;s people that have ethical problems in very important roles. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to continue a dialog with you if you continue to twist my words. There&#39;s no point in discussing. </p>

<p>A big portion of the role of the POTUS is Chief Executive, which is to select his staff and cabinet. The people that Trump picked are unqualified, or have moral, ethical or financial conflicts that preclude them from working in the best interest of the country. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a personal preference. </p>

<p>But feel free to defend Kushner and Priutt. Tell me how they are not morally or ethically corrupt in their roles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One corruption: nepotism, i.e. appointing unqualified family members to key jobs.  Big ethics no-no.</p>

<p>Two corruption: Constant self-dealing, using his role as chief executive to make the government hire and pay his own personal properties and services.</p>

<p>Three corruption: Selling anonymous access to the White House by frequenting his personal clubs, for which he upped membership fees after taking office, and refusing to release visitor logs -- while passing policies that greatly enrich these members personally.</p>

<p>Four corruption: Having attorneys for the Trump Organization try to <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/world/americas/trump-panama-hotel-dispute.amp.html">threaten the president of Panama</a> to intercede in a legal dispute involving a Trump property, implying the president would be held accountable by the Trump Administration if he failed to do so.</p>

<p>Five corruption: Having his son-in-law go around offering to <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/economy/jared-kushner-others-gerrymander-sell-visas-foreigners-steep-discount">sell visas</a> in exchange for investment in his personal enterprises.</p>

<p>Six corruption: Having his son-in-law going around soliciting foreign leaders for money to save his failing building investment <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/thehill.com/homenews/administration/376436-kushner-family-company-solicited-qatari-government-investment-just%3Famp">in exchange for favorable American foreign policy</a>.</p>

<p>Seven corruption: Tipping his <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/business/wp/2018/03/02/shortly-before-trump-announced-tariffs-his-former-adviser-dumped-millions-in-steel-related-stocks/">friends off about domestic policy changes</a> so they can trade on the news and make money, when he doesn&#39;t try to just <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/28/carl-icahns-failed-raid-on-washington/amp">appoint his friends to government posts so they can make the changes themselves</a>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty more, I haven&#39;t even mentioned the scores of grifts and grafts his appointees are running, plus who knows what we haven&#39;t even uncovered yet.</p>

<p>The immigration problem is significantly more serious from airports than it is from the Mexican border, yet Trump&#39;s wall fantasies have nothing to do with the real problems. </p>
