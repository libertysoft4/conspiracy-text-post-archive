What if it was actually Trump&#39;s intention all along to push further into Syria but he needed plausible deniability first so that&#39;s why he came out days before the supposed chemical attack to say publicly that he wanted US troops out of Syria? What if he is the ultimate con man—<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick">confidence man</a>—used as a vassal in order for the establishment to clamp down on the internet and social media via this Russia scandal? Bob Mueller and Trump met and talked to one another the day before Rosenstein wrote the letter appointing Mueller as Special Counsel—what if that was merely an interview for a role in a manufactured play the establishment wanted to orchestrate? All a manufactured game and a ruse while our rights and privacy are taken away under the guise of Russiaphobia? And Trump is in on it. The ultimate divide and conquer scheme.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t it Trump in the primaries screaming about Bush lying us into war and lying about WMDs? It was. The ultimate ruse.</p>

<p>Trump sold out his associates and friends in order to gain the Presidency.</p>

<p>It is like you failed to read what I wrote. If Trump sold out in order to gain the presidency—throwing Manafort and others under the bus—and this is all an act then Sessions is in on it and their fighting is playacting.</p>

<p>So him stopping human trafficking suddenly absolves him? Or answers my questions? He has to at least to appear to DO SOMETHING and tackling human traffickers and pedophiles and gangs isn&#39;t that hard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you <em>want</em> this to be a deep state conspiracy but it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>First of all, Manafort is a fall guy, he is loyal to whomever is paying him more. Flynn will be pardoned as he threw away any validity of his own testimony by admitting he lied.  He may get a slap on the wrist but nothing major.  I have followed Sessions for my entire life and he has always fought the establishment - he is one of the few men in our govt with true integrity.</p>

<p>And yes, stopping human trafficking does absolve him.  That is a billion dollar black market business that <em>your government</em> has <strong>allowed</strong> to happen for your entire life.  Obama, Bush, Jr., Clinton, Bush Sr. all turned a blind eye to the human trafficking trade and made MINIMAL effort to halt it.</p>

<p>Trump has put it on a full stop in his first year.  He has demolished their networks and stated he plans to make high profile arrests with his sealed indictments.  </p>

<p>You suggesting that this isn&#39;t a hard thing to do is complete nonsense.  This has been carefully planned and is costing the powers that be in America a lot of under the table wealth. To pretend like 10,000+ arrests in a year &#39;isn&#39;t that hard&#39; tells me that you are relatively new to this.  </p>

<p>this one cites a Neon Nettle (called &quot;fake news&quot; even by ardent pizzagate truthers) article that claimed 3,000 were arrested.  That article no longer exists, and the 6,000 number came from someone stating &quot;well since it was 3,000 in April must be 6,000 now!  Not a great source.</p>

<p>Ah, here is Liz Cronkin&#39;s article.  First, note that this lumps in a LOT of sex crimes, mostly just johns and street-walkers, not just pedophiles.  Secondly, the data she cites contradicts her claim.  &quot;less than 400 sex trafficking-related arrests in 2014 according to the FBI,&quot; but the FBI specifically states that the 400 number is a small slice of the action and in no way should be taken to be a complete tally of arrests.  Thirdly, most of the arrest that she credits Trump for were non-Federal arrests, which Trump has no influence on.  So thanks, but none of this is evidence of anything.</p>

<p><a href="https://reason.com/blog/2017/02/27/trumps-fake-crackdown-on-sex-trafficking">Here&#39;s a good rebuttal</a> of Liz Cronkin&#39;s piece with citations for every claim.  </p>

<p>Does Liz have any new info out there?</p>
