<p>I am curious how this sub feels. While most of us don&#39;t believe every single conspiracy under the sun, most of us would agree governments have a long and wide history of lying, stealing, killing and have even committing genocide in order to further their own interests with no interest of helping humanity. With the recent calls for gun control in the US and many companies changing policies towards firearms related companies and some even calling for the repeal of the 2nd amendment. Do you support the 2nd Amendment? (please be civil, I know this can be a hot button issue)</p>

I wanted to see if there is a correlation of people who don&#39;t blindly trust their government and support gun rights. As for criminals I m not sure how they feel...if guns are legal it does give them a larger pool of people to steal guns from.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To find out why people support or oppose the 2nd ammendment is to analyze it&#39;s root causes and demographics.</p>

<p>The largest determining demographic is location, rural vs urban. This also explains why most gun prohibiting laws come from Republicans while the Democratic base is pro gun control. Simply put Republicans in government hail from larger cities. A democrat and republican are equally likely to support or oppose guns when sampled in the same location.</p>

<p>Now that we know the cause, let us analyze the triggers.</p>

<p>Rural areas have guns and exposure at a younger age.</p>

<p>Rural areas use guns for hunting.</p>

<p>Urban areas have increased crime.</p>

<p>Urban areas have a higher percentage of homicides.</p>

<p>The support or lack thereof in this sub is simply due to the statistics of location.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating. I think there is a lot of truth to this.
Personally I may be an outlier.
I grew up very rural, was raised anti-gun.
Moved to super anti-gun downtown Los Angeles and had my door kicked in by a man with a knife at 3am. I lived 5 blocks from the police station and when I called 911, I was told &quot;Is the attacker inside? No? Ok, we will be there in 45-60 minutes&quot;...and they never showed up. The next day I applied to become a gun owner. However, in my new state which is much more 2A friendly, even in the city many are anti-gun. While rurally (the majority of the state) they are pro-gun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s a false equivalency going on here, where liberals are portrayed as wanting to take away all gun rights, repeal the 2nd Amendment, and even confiscate all guns.</p>

<p>The reality is more nuanced, with most “liberals” arguing for stricter controls on gun ownership and education.</p>

<p>It’s basically like “conservatives” are saying that anyone in the country should be allowed to purchase and operate an automobile with no checks aside from signing up online and being mailed a driver’s license. When someone says that there should be a driving test and insurance requirement, they are misrepresenting this as a call for automobiles to be completely banned.</p>

<p>Really people just want some restrictions so we don’t keep having random psychopaths buying guns and then going on killing sprees.</p>

<p>Even something as simple as a psychological evaluation for non-hunters would probably have stopped half of these catastrophes. And we can of course invoke the slippery slope fallacy and say that people would be denied gun ownership because of their political beliefs, but in reality there have to be ways to make it fair.</p>

<p>That’s why I don’t think guns will ever actually be banned outright like people are afraid of. In fact, it’s starting to seem like this whole thing has been manufactured to divide us and make it seem like there are only two choices, no restrictions and complete restrictions, so that we completely forget about everything in between.</p>

<p>It seems like there is a conspiracy to polarize the gun control debate to make conservatives think liberals want to take all their guns, and to make liberals think conservatives want everyone to be able to buy guns like they buy groceries. </p>
