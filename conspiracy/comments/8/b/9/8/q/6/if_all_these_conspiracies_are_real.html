The trannies are in place, pop culture is dominated by luciferian symbolism and idolism, media has become too powerful, seems like we&#39;re on the way to a WW3 at a breakneck pace. So doesn&#39;t this mean the bad guys won?</p>

<p>Btw: I&#39;m a media studies major and since getting into my major classes and really seeing how the media REALLY works has opened my eyes to a lot of what I used to see as crazy conspiracies. You can only see this stuff frfr once you understand EVERY. SINGLE. THING. YOU. SEE. on tv is there because someone wants u to see it and take a specific message from it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no.  Yes the one world system is already in place, just waiting for the catching away before they unleash their next big deception (fake alien invasion or new age nonsense).  They will be given their kingdom for a short time but Jesus Christ is already victorious.  Simply trust in him for your salvation by repenting and believing the gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>God came in the flesh and died for you personally to be your Passover Lamb for eternity.  Believe the above gospel in your heart, let him know you understand what he did for you and you will have victory over all of this.  There is no use fighting against prophesy.  It&#39;s all going to come to pass.  Jesus Christ it he door out of this present evil world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We cannot save ourselves.  He saves us by being the Passover blood sacrifice for our sins.  We apply that sacrifice to ourselves by believing the gospel above.</p>

<p>Jesus already saved the world from sin but if you don&#39;t believe he did it for you then it doesn&#39;t apply to you.  It&#39;s like a parent that has a child that did something wrong and simply wants them to admit it before forgiving them.  In order for the child to be forgiven they must first understand that they have done wrong and admit it then they can accept the atonement.</p>

<p>In the case of the blood atonement of Jesus Christ once one repents and believes the gospel then they spiritually cleansed by the blood of the Lamb and spiritually circumcised.  Their soul is protected from all future sin and all past sin is washed away:</p>

<p>Col 2:8  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. 
Col 2:9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. 
Col 2:10  And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power: 
Col 2:11  In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:</p>

<p>When a body is not separated from the soul then when the body sins, the soul is tainted by sin:</p>

<p>Lev 5:17  And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. 
Lev 5:18  And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him. </p>

<p>God cannot allow sin in his presence.  Sin can only be washed away with the blood of Jesus Christ.  Those animal sacrifices in the Old Testament only covered sin.  The sacrifice of Jesus Christ washes it away.  So once you believe the gospel and have your sins spirally washed away at the same time your soul is circumcised from your flesh, your soul is then protected and will be sinless for eternity, even if your flesh sins after that point.</p>

<p>It is sweet once you understand what&#39;s going on.  Lucifer and his minions will do whatever they can through indoctrination and deception to reject this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to see sun worshipers just search for &quot;blood over intent&quot; on youtube.  Jesus Christ is God the Father&#39;s human Body (Son of God).  The sun is a part of the creation.</p>

<p>Col 2:8  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. 
Col 2:9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. </p>

<p>In him was the fullness of the Godhead.</p>

<p>Joh_10:30  I and my Father are one.</p>

<p>The Cathlic &quot;Trinity&quot; where there is &quot;God the son&quot; is a false concept.</p>

<p>The title &quot;Sun of Righteousness&quot; is in relation to his 2nd coming when he will melt all the elements with fire.  The sun is a picture of Jesus Christ (the bridegroom) not the other way around.</p>

<p>Our chance is their infighting, there is no mafias that are free from it, especially after whoever&#39;s charge dies (eg. due to old age, Rockfeller) and new faces come into power (like DT), that&#39;s when they&#39;re the weakest. Sadly most western people fall into the un-pragmatic and OCD-ish moral cleanliness that will doom them into keep hoping until a perfect being aka Jesus come to save them, because they won&#39;t bother working with anything else that are impure, which will never happen.</p>
