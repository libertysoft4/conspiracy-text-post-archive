    <div class="md"><p>no balance. the power that rules the empire is singular, centralized and absolute.  all resistance to this power is crushed ruthlessly (saddam, gaddafi , assad, war on terror, war on drugs, assassinations, censorship, colour revolutions).<br/>
what we see as &#39;history&#39; and politics is just a scripted play to deceive, disorient and divide the &#39;cannon fodder&#39; and to fulfill prophecies. history is predetermined.  ww3 is &#39;needed&#39; to produce a hegelian synthesis, otherwise it is/would be perfectly avoidable. </p>

<p>when (iirc in the &#39;40s or &#39;50s) think tanks of the american tax exempt foundations looked into the most efficient ways to change a society, they found that it is war. therefore they use war as a tool to reshape societies.</p>

<p>all the nations must be exhausted completely, so that in the end they surrender their sovereignty to the un which is a vatican front.  they are building the third temple in jerusalem which will also be placed under un control on behalf of the papacy.<br/>
the vatican already owns 60% of the old city and all of mount zion. the israeli government is complicit in this.</p>

<p>zionism, communism, capitalism, fascism serve(d) their historic purpose and are being replaced by collectivist/luciferianism.  they market it as new age movement, but in reality it will be a new dark ages with slavery and all. this is what the entertainment industry is pushing for many years now.  </p>

<p>rome-london-israel-wash dc-putin-china-turkey-germany-the saudis etc is one big team, coordinated by the jesuits/smom, because they run the intel agencies, mic/big oil and the financial world along with the abrahamic religions. they hide their unity while dividing the rest of us with msm, religion and other deceptions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now I do believe in God, a creator of some kind. That being said I&#39;m pretty sure all organized religions are just pyramid schemes to push agendas. So many hardliner Christians claim the Holy Bible is the absolute word of God. The history of it being edited several times over centuries, with parts added and removed would claim otherwise. Same with Islam and Judaism. Now I believe the Elites that rule this Western World will shift what unfolds in the world to match a lot of these &quot;prophecies&quot; of several religions because it allows them to control a lot of people more easily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;False Jews&quot; and &quot;synagogue of Satan&quot; are from the new testament regarding Jews prosecuting the church. Since these Jews did not believe Jesus was the Messiah, they were called nonbelieving Jews, aka false Jews. At the time, nonbelieving = Satan.</p>

<p>However, Jews were not in charge of prosecutions at this time, the Romans were. The Romans ruled the land. And since the Romans created Christianity for their own benefit, these terms are merely political in nature for those times.</p>

<p>Regarding the &quot;Kazarian Mafia&quot;, there&#39;s no proof they took over Judaism and now runs Israel. Zero proof. Khazars were nomadic people made from Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists. They were attacked and remaining ones dispersed. Unfortunately, we don&#39;t have any strong Khazar DNA to cross check so we have no clue if they died off or what. The notion that Jews today are actually Khazars stem from anti-semitism, trying to justify the idea that Jews should not have a homeland.</p>

<p>Sephardic Jews show middle eastern DNA. Ashkenazi Jews show middle eastern (similar to those of Sephardic Jews) and European DNA. The maternal line of Ashkenazi Jews shows higher European DNA, while the Paternal line of Ashkenazi Jews shows higher European DNA. Most likely the male Jews taken as slaves by the Romans, once freed by the Persians, started converting and marrying European women.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except for Romans creating Jesus, I think you might be correct that it\s a lot more fluid in reality.. I used the &quot;Khazar Mafia&quot; term, as more of a general term on the Russian/European land-owning class in Israel. Myths and rumors  a plenty. What almost certainly went with the temple was the paperwork they had on who&#39;s who. Difficult to find the real descendants of the tribe of Levi, to serve in the temple. So now we have this weird group; Not a race, not a religion, not really one nation, not really two, not a ideology or political movement. What is &quot;Israel&quot; or &quot;the Jews&quot; today? I love the Torah, but I still feel sick thinking about some of the stuff from the talmud. There is not a human being that&#39;s the enemy, it&#39;s a spiritual one.    </p>

<p>&quot;Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own, for he is a liar and the father of it.&quot;</p>

<p>How do one fight a lie? With truth. So me using loose generalizations is not helping, and I&#39;m sorry.
Thanks for the informative post, will look into the Sephardic Jews, I had forgotten them completely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great reply, thank you for that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems to be human nature to destroy any and all records of the people we conquer. Israelites did it, Philistines did it, Egyptians did it, Romans did it... Every human record from those civilizations and statues and building just absolutely destroyed. Imagine what we would know if all that information was preserved...</p>

<p>DNA wise, I would say Jews are a race. I consider myself Jewish and can take my lineage back to current day Moldova from the 19th century just through family trees passed down. Jews have a specific DNA strand just like Germans do, or Italians do. Nothing like making homemade challah bread by hand to make you feel connected to previous generations.</p>

<p>Regarding Jesus... we don&#39;t know. Nobody knows for sure. We know Romans were pagans just like Egyptians, and the Israelites created the first known monotheist religion. Romans then adopted that due to Judaism and Christianity becoming popular in the region. And we know the story of Jesus is very similar to the Sun god which most Pagan civilizations had a story about. Check out the theory that Jesus was the son of Cleopatra and Caesar. Not saying it&#39;s the truth, because again we don&#39;t know, but I find it intriguing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two Reasons All should Believe
1.    The report itself. God has spoken by the mouths of the prophets since the world began (Act_3:21; Heb_1:1-3; 1Pe_1:10-12). God Himself began the long list of prophecies of the coming Redeemer by promising that the Seed of the Woman would crush the serpent’s head and restore man’s dominion (Gen_3:15-16). Abraham and Isaac spoke of Him coming through their seed (Gen_12:1-3; Gen_15:4-6; Gen_17:4-8, Gen_17:19-21; Gen_21:12; Gen_26:4). Jacob said He would come from Judah (Gen_49:10). Moses predicted Him as a prophet like himself (Deu_18:15-19). David referred to Him as coming from his seed (2Sa_7:1-29). Isaiah said He would be born of a virgin in Judah of the house of David (Isa_7:14; Isa_9:6-7), and pictured His rejection and sufferings (Isaiah 52:13-53:12). Others also made reports of His coming, so Israel had no excuse for their unbelief when He did come.
2.    Miracles confirming the report. The report was not only predicted and then literally fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth, but there were also miracles confirming to Israel the fact that He was the true Messiah sent by God (Isa_11:1-2; Isa_42:1-6; Isa_61:1-2; Mat_11:1-6; Luk_4:16-18; Act_2:22; Act_10:38). The arm of the Lord is figurative of His power, which Isaiah predicted would be revealed along with the report (Joh_5:20, Joh_5:36; Joh_10:25-38; Joh_12:38-40; Joh_14:10-12; Joh_15:24).</p>

<p>IMHO that is only possible if there&#39;s a huge immigration movement where smaller clans stayed together which then spread from East Europe through the rest of Europe where they thinned out. The largest block of them remained in East Europe.</p>

<p>Sephardic Jews might just be a mixture of these immigrated clans with the north African islamic tribes which invaded Spain like the Spanish population mixed with these groups.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make any sense. God is not going to make Christians who  don&#39;t understand certain doctrine, that also just happen to fall for a replacement theology doctrine simply because they mistake Paul saying there is no longer jew or greek the synagogue of Satan.</p>

<p>I agree we only know in part and that&#39;s why this is just my theory.  I think it&#39;s very hard to understand future prophesy when certain mysteries aren&#39;t reviled to us yet.  When I think of the synagogue of Satan groups like the Black Hebrew Israelites and Satanic types like the Rothschilds who say they are Jews but are likely Luciferin.

If they are infiltrated by false jews or if the entire Israel deal is completely propaganda and they actually have zero power and Satan is just trying to destroy them.

    <div class="md"><p>Israel it seems will have a big part in the Antichrist&#39;s kingdom.  Right now they are technically Satan&#39;s spiritual children.  I think they are just greatly deceived and the leaders at the top are for sure just pawns of Satan.</p>

<p>Dan_9:27  And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.</p>

<p>If you search the specific phrase &quot;the covenant&quot; in the OT it is always referring to the agreement between God and his people at that time.  In Danial&#39;s case it&#39;s Israel.  So the Antichrist will &quot;confirm the covenant&quot; between God and Israel for a time.  It seems to me that Israel will be accepting the Antichrist as their Messiah when he shows up at first.  The temple will be rebuilt at some point and sacrifices will start again then half way through this time period he will turn on them.  They will flee to the mountains and God will protect the remnant.  Michael will defend them (what a show that would be).</p>

<p>Satan is for sure straw manning the Jews to gin up hate against them.  Look at 90% of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and you will see the effect of it.</p>

<p>Who are absolutely sure that all these conspiracy&#39;s against Israel are propaganda. And I almost am inclined to agree with them. You might say they are working for Israel and lying to us all. However, regardless of what anyone thinks including me. I cannot ever go against Israel. I believe the bible is all truth not just some truth. So I have no choice but to support Israel. So I guess according to God we need to support these evil people whom are blinded to the truth, all the way up till we are gone. So there must be other reasons I don&#39;t understand. This is also why I don&#39;t understand what to believe about Israel at all concerning the conspiracy&#39;s behind it.</p>

There is no reason to defend Israel politically or anything.  Our purpose is to get people into Christ and win over as many of Satan&#39;s children as possible into the adoption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;False Jews&quot; and &quot;synagogue of Satan&quot; are from the new testament regarding Jews prosecuting the church. Since these Jews did not believe Jesus was the Messiah, they were called nonbelieving Jews, aka false Jews. At the time, nonbelieving = Satan.</p>

<p>However, Jews were not in charge of prosecutions at this time, the Romans were. The Romans ruled the land. And since the Romans created Christianity for their own benefit, these terms are merely political in nature for those times.</p>

<p>Regarding the &quot;Kazarian Mafia&quot;, there&#39;s no proof they took over Judaism and now runs Israel. Zero proof. Khazars were nomadic people made from Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists. They were attacked and remaining ones dispersed. Unfortunately, we don&#39;t have any strong Khazar DNA to cross check so we have no clue if they died off or what. The notion that Jews today are actually Khazars stem from anti-semitism, trying to justify the idea that Jews should not have a homeland.</p>

<p>Sephardic Jews show middle eastern DNA. Ashkenazi Jews show middle eastern (similar to those of Sephardic Jews) and European DNA. The maternal line of Ashkenazi Jews shows higher European DNA, while the Paternal line of Ashkenazi Jews shows higher European DNA. Most likely the male Jews taken as slaves by the Romans, once freed by the Persians, started converting and marrying European women.</p>
