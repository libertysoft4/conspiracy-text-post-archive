    <div class="md"><p>This country sure has it&#39;s fair share of issues, but it is not nearly as bad as this thread is leading it on to be. Reddit, a long with other social media and biased news outlets, are echo chambers for &quot;DAE America is terrible?!&quot;, and it just perpetuates a disgustingly negative attitude toward the overall state of the country. The reality is that there are a lot of problems, but there are thousands, if not millions, of people working toward solving those problems. Also, in the rear-view mirror, are a plethora of problems that have already been solved and have made this country a better place. If you&#39;re not careful, Reddit will turn you into a cynic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pointing out flaws do not negate the positives and it doesnt mean you do not appreciate the good stuff.</p>

<p>That being said, US is a huge mess. If you compare it to a similarly developed nation, you are being treated extremely awfully as people.</p>

<p>The biggest problem for me is that every facet of life, no matter what the original purpose of it is, has been designed to benefit corporations instead of people.</p>

<p>You see this in healthcare, education, labor rights, city planning etc.</p>

<p>The fact that you have a lot of billionaires doesnt make a society &quot;good&quot; when there are millions of people homeless, living in poverty and exploited. </p>

<p>Also the foreign policy of US is dreadful for millions of people around the world, the US is leading the one nation rebellion against saving the planet from climate change. The list is endless.</p>

<p>Any American who love their country should, in my opinion, bring forward these flaws and demand change instead of downplaying them or resorting to whataboutism. The same could be said for any resident of any country. No society is ever finished and we can always strive for better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really feel like that&#39;s the general direction of human history - the expanding sphere of &quot;us&quot; and the contracting surrounding &quot;them&quot;. As primitive humans we lived as individuals or small family groups; we eventually coalesced into larger tribes and clans of tens, and then into villages and cities of hundreds, thousands, confederations and eventually countries and nations and kingdoms, and now unions and cooperative states of hundreds of millions (and now billions) of people - all working under one unifying social contract. I think the general trend of history is for humans to cooperate and work together, not hostility (although competition is always healthy).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because American values have changed domestically does not mean that American values are followed through in a way that actually supports those beliefs or virtues whatsoever. Slavery, both sexual exploitation and labor, is rampant across the globe because of (arguably) consumerism, neoliberal policies, and the need for cheap or free workers to keep the entire crooked system kicking. Look at the active slave trade in Libya - that the US helped  cause - as an example. Likewise, besides female sex slaves, women in countries we don&#39;t care about are trampelled upon, killed, tortured and starved while absolutely nothing is done. See Yemen as an example of a horrendous war crime. Finally, laxed environmental policies are another reason why corporations migrated to countries that are paid off essentially not to enforce standards. This includes India, China etc. My point is not that your examples are poor at all (they&#39;re great examples actually) but that by allowing the world to suffer under those same moral injustices because we can&#39;t bear them ourselves is frightening to contemplate. Just because it is out of sight, somewhat, doesn&#39;t mean it is out of mind. I would lastly say that just because we have progressed through time does not mean people have become more progressive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some guy in front of me moved over on a 4 lane street and crashed right into a woman in a car. He didn&#39;t even look to see if there was anyone over there. Fortunately for the older lady I was behind the entire time with my dash-cam. I followed them to pull over. Got out and told her to call the cops and stay in the car. The guy didn&#39;t want the cops involved and I said there is no say in it. You are at fault and I have the evidence. He wanted to offer her 60$ (im sure whatever he had in his pocket) but there&#39;s thousands of dollars of work that needs to be done. So, as I&#39;m waiting for the police I uploaded the video to Youtube and showed the officer. He didn&#39;t need anything else after that.</p>

<p>The woman that got hit in the car was okay and sent me a very very nice email. I told her we all need to take care of each other. She was genuinely thankful that I took the situation in control because it would have been a lot different if I didn&#39;t. There&#39;s good people out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, our world views are always changing. I had doubts when I was younger, in church and church camp etc. I started putting myself in other peoples shoes so to speak. I envisioned I was not born who I was, but rather someone from a distant country. It dawned on me early that I would not be a Christian, and that myself and everyone I knew would burn in hell, regardless of the life led or deeds accomplished. This bothered me a lot. I went even deeper and branched out to other living things, the conclusion terrified me. That an all perfect god created a system designed on strife, conflict, and death. I talked to my priest at the time, concerning my doubts. I cannot recall the exact conversation, but I walked away convinced that no moral god would create this system of chaos and destruction. To live you must destroy something, no matter if you&#39;re big or small. No benelovent god would create such a system, nor is the concept of hell even worth entertaining. Later on I studied more religions and more cultures, and the one thing I found in common is the majority of them are created to inspire hope and fear, these two emotions are the staple of any method of controlling people on a massive scale. I could go back to being a believer, but it&#39;s very unlikely. I was taught religion and raised not to question it. As in my current beliefs were self realized and based around how I see the world. Regardless of what one believes, it isn;t about right or wrong, but acceptance. Religion IMO should be personal to the person alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By your own definition of Atheism you are not an Atheist. Without belief would mean you have an absence of belief. What you just described is disbelief, an affirmative belief that God does not exist. If we believe that Atheism includes disbelief (it does) then you are, by your own definition an Atheist. </p>

<p>That being said, I believe you when you say you came to this conclusion on your own. Only thing is, these are not conceptual ideas unique to you. Those &quot;prophets&quot; I listed above have been saying these same things since before you were born. Whether you realize it or not you do not have to seek them out to be indoctrinated by their teachings, it&#39;s everywhere and is a part of our lives as much if not more than any other religion. </p>

<p>Stop playing that silly game, its very obvious science cant prove a negative.  So without experiment, theyve believed what they want to believe rather than deferring to being in an unknown (less comfortable state) </p>

<p>In your attempt to be witty, you also failed to see that there is comfort in both atheism and theism.  Atheism is oddly comforting since it eliminates some of the more intricate not yetunderstood mechanisms of our world - unknowns.  Theism is comforting for more obvious reasons, although if one is &quot;sinful&quot; they probably dont feel very comfortable and perhaps have a greater tendency towards agnosticism or atheism</p>

<p>The term is gnostic ie. gnostic atheist/theist. Most atheists are an agnostic atheist. Without knowledge/without belief. As an atheist I would love to know the comforts available, when deep down inside I know there is no true just in this existence. A comfort from that other than drug use would be most welcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am an atheist. There is no evidence for a creator so I have no reason to believe in one.<br/>
A creator is just someone&#39;s imagined explanation for things they do not understand. As an atheist I am open in acknowledging there are many things we do not yet have an explanation for. Religious assertions that there is a creator are not explanations, they are just unsupported guesses. The guess that there is a creator doesn&#39;t explain anything since it assumes the existence of something even harder to explain than the universe itself.<br/>
I believe religious people are that way because they are uncomfortable with a lack of explanation. As an atheist I find unexplained things fascinating and worthy of investigation. It&#39;s not useful to just decide how you think things work. You can have ideas but unless you can find a way to test them they are just in your imagination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atheism by definition is to not have a theistic belief system. Theists are choosing to believe in something even though there is not evidence for that thing. Agnostics in my opinion are closer to theists because they seem to think that the options between god or no god ) or other) are equally valid but they can&#39;t decide one way or another, it&#39;s buying into the idea that one needs a belief system. I think agnostics only exist because of theists framing the debate to somehow require evidence of absence, when the absence of evidence makes theism and agnosticism a non scientific discussion</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But in affirming that there is no creator is just as he says comforting in eliminating unknowns atheism is indoctrined to it&#39;s definition   which is a belief in no creator or higher power. Which could be considered a religion considering everything else logically came from something else and atheism is denying any sort of higher being possible of construction just like we have done with AI. All atheism is saying is idk wtf is going on but there definitely isn&#39;t a God or Creator </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly because (if you ask me ) it could possibly seem that the idea of a god or a creator is more of a natural nobility thing as in how pack and tribe mentality animals elect Alphas but on a species wide spectrum. Because in a sense Humans are God&#39;s of this plain compared to other things we manipulate ,destroy and transform the natural and create something of our own. We have manipulated species to be enslaved in domestication to work better for us and not for them( like cattle goats pigs) we have created loyal worshipping species that have we have rendered useless through years of selective breeding ( dogs cats ) and all alone at the top of the mountain we look to the skies for answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To say that atheists affirm there is no creator is inaccurate. I realise some do but that&#39;s not what atheism is. Atheism is to not have a theistic belief system. There is a difference between not believing in a god and believing there is no god. As far as I&#39;m concerned the existence or not of a god is a non discussion, there is no evidence of such a thing and there is no reason anyone should need to believe against something which is just a concept someone else imagined. Even if tomorrow some god makes itself known and incontrovertible evidence is suddenly available I can remain atheist because theism is belief without evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your definition of theism is off it has nothing to do with faith or evidence theism is the belief of a god so (a)theism is the particular non belief in a god its synonymous with irreligion non belief etc I think you may be confused. Theism existed before atheism that&#39;s why atheism is defined from theism not by itself it&#39;s like satanism and Christianity satanism isn&#39;t Christianity directly but you can&#39;t have it without Christianity it&#39;s a belief based on other beliefs just like atheism is a belief attached to theism in it&#39;s opposite. But for final clarity Atheism is not agnosticism it is the specific non belief in a god or Creator so yes you hardcore Atheists who try to define your intelligence and belittle everyone with your (a)theistic beliefs are just as much a part of a religious thought as the damn pope same logic same thing Atheism is a form of Theism and theism is a belief in a god or Creator so do with that what you will. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5PMPmyf0wX4?t=13">youtube</a></p>

<p>I do believe that people are inherently good, but Im also with OP a hundred percent. Im from a military family (dad was a Marine Corps fighter pilot, mom was a physical therapist in the Navy, cousin is a current general in the Air Force) and it was depressing as hell when I found out what the American government actually is, what it has been for a very long time now. </p>

<p>I would love to dismiss that as &quot;just the government&quot;, but what does that mean, who are they? Is it the Swiss? are they the ones running the government? or is other Americans?  </p>

<p>I think it was Smedley Butler who first made me look at things differently. I mean, here was a... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>US Marine Corps major general, the highest rank authorized at that time, and at the time of his death the most decorated Marine in U.S. history. </p>

<p>By the end of his career, Butler had received 16 medals, five for heroism. He is one of 19 men to receive the Medal of Honor twice, one of three to be awarded both the Marine Corps Brevet Medal and the Medal of Honor, and the only Marine to be awarded the Brevet Medal and two Medals of Honor, all for separate actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so this isnt exactly some hippie burnout we&#39;re talking about. This is a man who knows how things work, and its not the America we were ever told about. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers.</em> </p>

<p><em>In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.</em> </p>

<p><em>I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested.</em> </p>

<p><em>Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.&quot;</em> </p>

<p>Food is not hard to find. No, its not fucking hand picked greens from a local producer who sang opera to his vegetables, but its food. Rice and beans 6 times a week is still valuable nutrition. In at least 1 state theres mandated nutrition levels of the food that can be served. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of candidates who are honest and moral but unfortunately they cannot get far without adequate campaign funding. Campaigns cost a lot of money, and interest groups are all too happy to fund a candidate&#39;s campaign, quid pro quo once the candidate gets elected. So right off the bat most politicians already have a conflict of interest before even stepping into office. Sure it would be great to stop corruption, but voting is like trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. There is something fundamentally wrong with the system as it is now, and all the votes in the world will not fix it.   </p>

Lets not pretend Americans have a reputation for voter turnout. Half the country doesn’t even vote in the presidential election. Not voting is just waiting for the problem to solve its self.

    <div class="md"><p>Our economic system could work like a meritocracy if people viewed it like that, and it does in some cases. If people bought products based on the ethics of the company and the product instead of just choosing the cheapest and easiest solution (which is normally the most unethical) then we wouldn&#39;t foster the kind of corporate environment we do today. It is happening to an extent, with things such as fairtrade, (which ironically guarantees the fair payment of farmers abroad but we have no such thing for workers in our own country) but it should be something that&#39;s common. We should view the things we buy with a more an inquisitive eye rather than finding the cheapest solution. Of course, because it has gotten so bad many comprimises need to be made because some literally do not have the resources to have the luxury of choosing the most ethical option and that is why also we should have the idea in the collective consciousness that more money =/= more power but more responsibility, so we see those spending more money as more responsible for the direction of the economy. We also need to rethink what &quot;profit&quot; is.</p>

It doesn&#39;t even fuckin matter which government it is, they all share the same goal: peace. Its why every relevant political ideology in the history of mankind has had prisons and enforcement officers.</p>

<p>The methods used to maintain peace or what differ. Even in complete Anarchy the understood rule is that no one rules. Law and order are a necessary and guaranteed result of any society. The laws may be slavery and the order may be public executions, but the society still seeks to self regulate.</p>

<p>The point I think you&#39;re trying to make is that governments create power and power will corrupt anyone. This is why we have to be ever vigilant and always investigating people in power and their interests. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Governments form out of people trying to do their best</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do their best at what? Governing, ruling, exercising power over others? &quot;Trying to do their best&quot; is such an amorphous and empty phrase and covers up a lot of human misery, crimes, and death committed by those &quot;trying.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its why every relevant political ideology in the history of mankind has had prisons and enforcement officers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really, are you certain about that? Athenians and the Republics of Italy routinely exiled people. Enforcement officers were other members of the community (as in it wasn&#39;t there job or occupation, they were citizen&#39;s upholding the standard of the community, something akin to citizen&#39;s arrest today). Generally if someone was in trouble, they were placed under something like house arrest until they had a trial. There were no prisons and few jails. And very few 
enforcement officers.&quot; I mean, the US didn&#39;t have police forces until slave-catchers started doing patrols to catch runaway slaves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The methods used to maintain peace or what differ</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should read a book called <em>Discipline and Punishment</em> by Michel Foucault. He makes it clear that most punishment is about the state reinforcing its power over the bodies of its citizens. It&#39;s not about peace, but control. The king or the president need people to fill their armies and their factories. Most people, if given the chance, would say fuck that shit. They learn otherwise by the demonstration of the state&#39;s power over their very living essence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point I think you&#39;re trying to make is that governments create power and power will corrupt anyone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, the will to power existed before governments. Government is a tool for people to get and exercise power. Power is essential to life. We have (or had) power over animals and the earth to feed and sustain ourselves. One of the fundamental things governments do is claim the land that people live on as their own, and all the living things that use that land under the dominion of said government. Why? Because land is life for humans, even today.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but you don&#39;t really know what you are talking about, because you fundamentally don&#39;t understand what power is or where it comes from. I suggest that you reconsider what you think is you basis of knowledge for talking about this subject and read people like the aforementioned Foucault, Nietzsche, Plato, Hegel, and more random shit like Mao&#39;s <em>Little Red Book</em>. Read, don&#39;t watch videos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this applies to most western countries.. but this conspiracy really does hit home when the very people promoting security, anti-terrorism and democracy are the ones doing everything that is the opposite if not being responsible for threatening it.  Government declares a war on drugs while parts of it are the main importers/facilitators.  It is mind boggling that a President could get a Nobel Peace Prize while engaged in war and proceeding to bomb 7 different countries afterward.  When such glaringly obvious incongruities are in the public eye and no body points it out or nobody cares.. Truely totalitarian Orwell stuff.. </p>

<p>&quot;Imagine if America was a dictatorship. You could let 1% of the people have all the nation&#39;s wealth. You could help your rich friends get richer by cutting their taxes. And bailing them out when they gamble and lose. You could ignore the needs of the poor for health care and education. Your media would appear free, but would secretly be controlled by one person and his family. You could wiretap phones. You could torture foreign prisoners. You could have rigged elections. You could lie about why you go to war. You could fill your prisons with one particular racial group, and no one would complain. You could use the media to scare the people into supporting policies that are against their interests.&quot; - Sacha Baron Cohen (The Dictator)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I look back at the indoctrination and the brainwash I received as a kid within the public school system, it was no wonder I thought the USA was some utopian magical country...I know better than that now. US Government, it&#39;s departments and agencies are corrupt to the core. US foreign policy has been hijacked by AIPAC. The zionist cancer that has been sleazing it&#39;s way into every corner of American society is rotting it out from the inside and diverting billion$ of tax payer money to Israel and the Middle Eastern wars...while American society and infrastructure falls apart at the seams...for decades.</p>

<p>What America could have been and what it has become...especially post 9/11...could not be anymore different. TPTB will not allow an anti-war presidential candidate take office. Peace is becoming a bad word in Washington DC...on top of that, Trump has brought the neocons back. John Bolton, the lord of preemptive illegal wars,  is now the National Security Advisor. There is only one reason they brought back a ghoul like Bolton...he has no conscience, he has no soul...and he will do ANYTHING that Netanyahu wants the US to do for Israel. Including sending American men and women overseas to die in zionist wars.</p>

<p>America needs a president of peace and freedom...but until that happens all the extremists trying to take away the Bill of Rights must either die off or just go away. Most Americans however, are very good people that have been lied to by the system all for all their lives.</p>

America being the world&#39;s police was tolerable because they stood for freedom, democracy, human rights, human decency etc.  Now that&#39;s kind of evaporated and the world leaders no longer talk with respect about one another, Russia feel.more like the world leaders but they work through sabotage and they don&#39;t stand for any of the good things.
