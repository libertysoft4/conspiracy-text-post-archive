    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory. To breed a new strain of brainwashed sheep to gain power from the people. Take your guns, your rights, your ability to fight back and it&#39;s all done by turning the people against each other. This radical leftism didn&#39;t happen before 2015. It just sprang out of nowhere as if injected into society and left to spread amongst the weak. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s be real. Obama and his expert team knew that women aren&#39;t paid less than men for the same job but he still tried to pass it off as a fact. They know that guns save more lives than they take per year. They know everything we think they don&#39;t but it&#39;s all theatre. Just a theory though.</p>

<p>Aprapos anecdotal tale:</p>

<p>I was at a bike race once, with my wife, and went up to a woman selling drinks. </p>

<p>Well they hire pretty hot scantily clad women to do this job it seems and I was being nonchalant about checking her out. All of a sudden she goes &quot;Hey Steve!!&#39; and hugs me.</p>

If you think that is an &quot;Action and reaction&quot; thing, then you need to review Newton&#39;s laws, as you&#39;ve got a fundamental misunderstanding of them.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s use some round numbers.  You slag the 90th floor of a 100-story building.  The 89th floor is designed to take the static load of the 10 floors above it.  It is <em>not</em> designed to take the dynamic load of decelerating those 10 floors once they start moving.  So it collapses, too.  Buildings are not vehicles, they are not designed with crumple zones, nor are they designed to act as brakes.   To do so would be a massive increase in weight and cost, and would make skyscrapers impractical.</p>

<p>Now, to the 88th floor.  It&#39;s now got the dynamic load of 11 floors falling on it. It, too, was designed for static load, so it goes.  12 floors fall and hit the 87th.  The weight of the debris in motion keeps increasing. An already-crumbled floor has the same weight as an intact floor, but no longer adsorbs any energy itself, so the effects get worse every time a floor collapses.   </p>

<p>I&#39;m having to take guesses on your vague comments to Newton, so I can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m even addressing your concerns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At no point is a &quot;smaller&quot; object hitting a &quot;bigger&quot; object.</p>

<p>Back to the analogy:  Take out the 90th floor.  You now have 10 floors landing on one floor, then 89th.  It collapses.</p>

<p>Now you have 11 floors landing on the 88th.  It collapses.</p>

<p>Now 12 land on the 87th.  It collapses.</p>

<p>Another way to look at it: 
Chop off floors 100 thru 88 and put them on the ground as a 12 story building.   Slag the 2nd floor.  It, plus the top 10, crush the first floor.</p>

<p>Reset to an intact building and add another floor. Take out the same one.  11 floors crush one, then 12 floors crush the new 1st floor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so I don&#39;t buy any of this crisis actor bullshit. I will however talk about YouTube. You realize that one the moment you upload something on YouTube they own it and there for have the right to do what ever they want with it right? And two, that YouTube is by no means the only video streaming site on the internet. </p>

<p>You might think that YouTube has some moral responsibility to provide a even platform for free speech but there terms of service totally disagrees with you. YouTube has guidelines and whatnot but these are not etched in stone, and are loose and open to interpretation. Like how nudity is banned from YouTube but you can find videos on breast feeding. Really though you give them the right to remove a video for literally any reason the second you upload it on there site. </p>

<p>Call it censorship, disagree with what they consider factual, stomp your feet, only use LiveLeak. YouTube always has and always will reserve the right to remove any video for any reason. As a matter of fact I&#39;m pretty sure every streaming video site on the internet reserves that right. Sites like Streamable and LiveLeak just choose not to try and steer the direction of content. Upload a video of a murder that is currently being investigated or some child porn and watch how fast those sites swing the banhammer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would celebrities want to symbolize the devil and pedophilia in their music videos? What purpose would that serve other than to let others know their secret agendas? What agenda would that even be? I think you’re over analyzing things man, and definitely giving these artists wayyy too much credit when it comes to their secret agendas. Bathtubs and mirrors are common within every single household it’s not weird that they show up in several music videos. </p>

<p>I’m all for symbolism and digging deeper but only in cases where it makes sense. None of the celebrities you listed are even smart enough to use symbolism in their videos to portray some dark message. You can watch literally any video and come up with a crazy conspiracy about the “symbolism” used if you claim common items are symbolizing some deeper message. </p>

<p>If you really think about what you’re saying, given the “symbols” you provided, you’re pretty much claiming that all of Hollywood and the music industry is one <em>giant</em> conspiracy pushing the agenda of the devil through symbolism that <em>nobody</em> even notices except for people like you who are <em>looking</em> for a deeper meaning when there isn’t one. There are thousands of videos with snakes in them, maybe some are symbolizing the devil, but I guarantee the majority of them are not. </p>

<p>Seriously though, support conspiracy theories that actually have hard evidence, not loosely formed theories that are so far fetched you’d get thrown into a mental institution just for talking about it with family or in public. Supporting theories that are concocted from merely symbols and speculation is a dark road you don’t want to go down. It’ll leave you questioning every aspect of reality and destroy any sliver of sanity you still have left. Supporting those theories serves you no benefit other than giving yourself a sense of superiority and it’s just not healthy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t read through their Terms of Service.  Since YouTube is a private company it would strike me as odd that they would be under any obligation to guarantee that you could find anything you want using whatever search terms you deem appropriate.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m an old guy, so I guess I don&#39;t understand all of this completely.  If I go to a grocery store to find &quot;Sugar Fruit Crunch&quot; and find that they don&#39;t carry &quot;Sugar Fruit Crunch&quot;, I feel no compulsion to go on the internet and bitch about how my grocery store is conspiring to deny people access to &quot;Sugar Fruit Crunch&quot;.  I tell the manager.  And if he tells me to &quot;go pound sand&quot; my only recourse is to shop elsewhere.  That store is a private enterprise and can sell what they please. </p>

<p>Last I checked, YouTube is a private enterprise as well.  They allow what they allow and provide an interface that gives you access to whatever they make available.  </p>

<p>Personally... I&#39;m glad that people have posted videos on how to lay engineered hardwood flooring and tile a bathroom shower.  Saved me thousands.  </p>

<p>It strikes me that there is a generation out there that expects that everything they want should be available instantly to them online.  And if it isn&#39;t, then it is because of some grand conspiracy against them.  </p>

<p>YouTube owes you nothing.  And I&#39;m just guessing that they probably don&#39;t give a rip whether you are able to find &quot;flat earth/David Hogg/Fake Moon Landing&quot; videos that satisfy your need for instant gratification or not. </p>

<p>If they were honest and said &quot;yh we are a left wing platform pushing left wing ideals&quot;, like Twitter should do as they claim they are unbias, same as Facebook then there would be no problems but it&#39;s fundamentally deceptive and disingenuous to say you&#39;re for all opinions and then immediately dismiss and suppress those they deem bad.</p>

<p>It is possible that they were deleted by the authors (or taken down for other reasons by youtube).</p>

<p>It is also possible that youtube is manipulating search results to hide things that don&#39;t fit the narrative. In this case, it appears that certain subjects that are conservative are hidden, while an alternative viewpoint is put to the top of the list.

    <div class="md"><p>I see.  You don&#39;t understand Newton.  Newton&#39;s Laws are <em>physics</em>, not engineering.   </p>

<p>Action and reaction talks about what forces are applied.  They do not apply is the strength of the material becomes involved, such as a segment of a building collapsing.   </p>

<p>Newton has nothing to do with this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A &quot;hammer&quot; is the wrong analogy.  A hammer delivers the same force every time it is swung.  In the case of a collapsing building, the force is <em>increasing</em> every time the weight of a new floor is added.  Hammers do not get heavier each time they strike.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I <em>am</em> a real engineer.  </p>

<p>Newton&#39;s laws are of <em>motion</em>.  They say absolutely nothing about whether a smaller object can &quot;crush&quot; a larger object.  The ability for one object to crush another depends heavily on the material properties of the object.  Newton&#39;s laws are about <em>motion</em>.</p>

<p>Newton&#39;s third law does not even <em>apply</em> here, let alone declare this to be &quot;impossible&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay.... I think whomever wrote that is making an assumption that all of the debris is cleanly ejected out the sides of the building.   That would change things.  </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not what happened.   The 10th floor of the building is not going to survive when the 90 floors above get crumbled into rubble and drop on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At no point is a &quot;smaller&quot; object hitting a &quot;bigger&quot; object.</p>

<p>Back to the analogy:  Take out the 90th floor.  You now have 10 floors landing on one floor, then 89th.  It collapses.</p>

<p>Now you have 11 floors landing on the 88th.  It collapses.</p>

<p>Now 12 land on the 87th.  It collapses.</p>

<p>Another way to look at it: 
Chop off floors 100 thru 88 and put them on the ground as a 12 story building.   Slag the 2nd floor.  It, plus the top 10, crush the first floor.</p>

<p>Reset to an intact building and add another floor. Take out the same one.  11 floors crush one, then 12 floors crush the new 1st floor.</p>
