This way the poor go fight while the wealthy stay home and gather more control for their children. The government knew this could be leverage since a modern draft would be ineffective so they took over the debts. They like expensive college for this. They could easily regulate and cap this industry like they do others but allow it to be chaotic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that capitalism has side stepped human rights such that obligation to repayment means the debt owner can call you to do as needed to fulfill a debt. Since the federal government owns this debt, they can enforce that you fight as repayment. The 13th amendment makes slavery a punishment for crime. If debt is enforceable then servitude can be demanded. As student debt effects mostly younger people, it can be used constitutionally to force enlistment. With trumps executive order to recal retired military, and expanding effective ages, he can send a very large portion of America to war. If they get rid of religious rejection, we are truly fucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everyone can do a trade. And the skill set is less transferable to alternative careers. If the market becomes saturated with, say &quot;windshield repair techs&quot; or &quot;plumbers&quot; then a lot of tradesmen will be unable to find work and have a lot of debt. They&#39;ll probably be worse off than someone with a 4 year degree, who will also likely have difficulty finding work.</p>

<p>No...the solution is to move past the mentality that one must work in order to put food in their bellies, a roof over the head and have access to quality medical care. Because many jobs are going away and those that remain will be held by the few who managed to win the rat race. With this current system, a lot of people will suffer in the long run just because they don&#39;t have opportunity to contribute to society not because they lack the desire or ability.  We must start enabling people to have an acceptable quality of life without necessarily needing gainful employment. It flys in the face of the Puritan work ethic but between automation, the Internet and AI driven data analysis, a lot of people (especially &quot;professionals&quot;) will be out of of work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying people aren&#39;t capable, I&#39;m saying the market will be over saturated. 
In some trades it already is. I have a friend who quit work as a locksmith because there was too much competition in his city.</p>

<p>There will be too many people specialized in whatever and not enough jobs. Because as jobs like truck driving and burger flipping become automated those millions and millions of people will likely start learning trades in a desperate move to stay alive. It will be slightly cheaper and less risk than going &quot;to school&quot; and the market will become over saturated. </p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t be paying for people to do nothing, you&#39;d be helping people survive. You be giving future generations the ability to pursue ventures which might not immediately put food on the table but are important for longevity of our civilization, endeavors such as higher education. </p>

And why would higher education help these people if they could make just as much money doing nothing at all and the effort and struggle to pursue further opportunities rewarded by said education would only have the profits milked by lazy commie turds who want to be a paid vegetable.  if you take money from those who work for it, to pay those who demand that they do nothing but deserve it, why would those who put food and money on the table continue working so hard if they can make the same sitting on the floor jerking off.

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like this can be used as an argument of too much immigration into our country. </p>

<p>I know someone that owns a construction company that has about 80 employees, about 90-95% of them are illegal lol. Same as the owner (my friend), he pays somebody else to sign off the jobs with their contractor license for him. He gets a ton of contracts like this because he can pay his workers much less than Americans that are building a life here, so he gets to underbid every other company around him.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, many immigrants that comes here works for as cheap as they can so they can always have a job, someone will always hire them to save money, whatever they are getting paid here is still worth much more in their own country. I am Brazilian and I know many people and even family members that has done this; came here through the border or overstayed their visa, share a cheap apartment with many others with the same goal, work any jobs that will hire them, save the most money they can and then go back to their country. Seen this happen countless time, one of my co-worker (I work in carpentry but am finishing up nursing school), never paid taxes cause he was trying to save the most he could, after about 7 years here, the IRS finally caught up to him, so he ran back to Brazil lol. He had already had sent most of money to his family over the years, and he brought the rest that he had saved with him when the IRS tried to go after him. </p>

<p>I know many legal immigrants like myself that are against illegal immigrants cause of reasons like this, because we live in the middle of them and know how the system works. The legal immigrants that are for the illegal immigrants are because they have illegal family members and friends here and don&#39;t want to see them get deported. I have many illegal family and friends here as well, but I would rather they get kicked out back to their country so we can try to save ours than all of us sinking down together. </p>

<p>Too much people in a country = unlimited workers, unlimited workers means that an employer can treat employees like crap and pay the least amount they can because there is always someone else that will work for a little cheaper so they can have a job.</p>

<p>Less people in a country = limited amount of workers, limited amount of workers means employers have to treat employees good and keep paying them better than their competitions to keep those good employees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m pretty sure you can enlist to pay off student loans. It’s a tool for recruiters and helps those drowning in college loans.</p>

<p>I’ll say this, yes enlisting in the military might go against you morals...got it...but to get out of debt and establish yourself for a bit, VA Home Loan and 9/11 GI Bill is well worth it. </p>

<p>I’ll have to talk to a recruiter buddy and find out the ACTUAL program and stipulations etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good stuff and I’ll take your word for it. I enlisted but never to pay off loans. 7 years left!! ✊🏼😂</p>

<p>I had a good buddy in Drum who was getting his loans paid off and we wondered why he didn&#39;t come in on the commission side. He was 25 series and his degree was nothing special, so I would imagine the program was broader back in 07 08&#39;ish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>13 years and counting here.</p>

<p>Back then more people got the 45k to pay student loans but they still only numbered under 100. Now it&#39;s 65k and far fewer people. This is public info...</p>

<p>To put it in perspective it comes from the bonus funds, not VA college money. A lot less money and a lot more red tape on the bonus side. 45k is about 3x the max bonus going right now (for new enlistees). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely correct.<br/>
This is one of the biggest elephants in the room for this sub, imo.<br/>
They&#39;re trying to build an entire country that is either involved with the military or has been duped into worshiping the military.<br/>
One of the primary goals of masculinizing women in TV shows and movies is producing women who will join the military.<br/>
They&#39;re not even being subtle about this half the time. From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuwfgXD8qV8">Katy Perry videos</a> to Gal Godot&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jn8Ji0g5Rs"><em>frequently</em> mentioned</a> Israeli military service, to the new film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89OP78l9oF0"><em>Annihilation</em></a> they are trying to completely normalize, and glamorize, the concept of women in the military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>or.  to someone with a solid head on their shoulders it&#39;s an opportunity to work hard for 4 years and get a sweet free ride to very nice 4 year colleges.  </p>

<p>I made money going to college on the new gi bill.  graduated with 8k in debt in 2.5 years.  </p>

<p>That sweet college degree was all I needed to land my first six figure job.  </p>
