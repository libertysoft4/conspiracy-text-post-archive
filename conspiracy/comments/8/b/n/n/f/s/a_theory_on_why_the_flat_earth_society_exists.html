        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-04-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/faggot_tree.html">faggot_tree</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My goal for this post is not to start a debate on whether or not the Earth is flat. My goal is to explain why I think the FES (Flat Earth Society) exists.</p>

<p>When we think of Earth, the majority of humans think of it as being round.
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/WW7OK">https://imgur.com/a/WW7OK</a>
We have images from space of Earth being round, and other planetary bodies in our solar system are also round. It impossible for NASA to control every image online. We have Elon Musk who recently put his Tesla Roadster in space, and you can view the Earth in the background. </p>

<p>However, there is a smaller portion of the population that believes in a Flat Earth theory. We have all heard of people describe &quot;Flat Earthers&quot; as crazy. We also hear that conspiracy theorists are crazy and have crazy ideas, not based in reality. Our society tries to marginalize those with new or &quot;crazy&quot; ideas, ideas that do not fit in the &quot;normal box.&quot; I believe that Flat Earth Society is misinformation to keep people away from the real truth. The underlying purpose of the FES is to stifle free thinking by purposely creating an incorrect notion, and then have our society ridicule individuals over those beliefs. It also puts conspiracy theorists in a more negative light.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis</a></p>

<p>&quot;Gaia theory or the Gaia principle, proposes that living organisms interact with their surroundings on Earth to form a synergistic and self-regulating, complex system that helps to maintain and perpetuate the conditions for life on the planet.&quot; I want to further suggest that the Earth is alive. Trees and plants have consciousness, but could it be possible that the whole planet is a conscious being? I do not have scientific evidence to support my claim that the Earth is a living, intelligent being.  Returning to my main point, I believe people are being conditioned to ridicule ideas that would fundamentally change our perspective of the Earth. If we did know that the Earth was a living being, how would that change our perspective? I believe humanity would care more about reducing pollution, and care more about reducing our trash waste. We would treat our planet with more respect than we currently do. </p>

<p>Indigenous people have a connection with the Earth that our modern society has lost. People roll their eyes at the tree-hugging hippies, but what if those people are trying to connect with the tree consciousness, or trying to connect with Mother Earth, or Mother Gaia?</p>

<p>TL;DR - In summation, humanity is waking up and questioning our reality. They are trying to make sense of the world around them, and not just trust what a mainstream source says, and for that, I commend them. So whether you believe if the Earth is round or not, or whether the Earth is alive or not, it does not really matter. By ridiculing people who believe that the Earth is flat, we control and pressure people to conform. When our society ridicules ideas that challenge the status quo, we feel uncomfortable, and we become less of a free thinking society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dome, or firmament, is an interesting aspect of flat earth theory (see: operation starfish and fishbowl) but the crucial point is a lack of empirical evidence for earth curvature. Certainly Hollywood propaganda doesn&#39;t make something so, and the same could be said for space and the ball earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll trust nature over Hollywood propaganda, thanks. The existence of space movies does not negate the observable natural world. However movies like The Truman Show perpetuate esoteric gnostic symbolism (such as living in a dome). That to me is obvious proof that it&#39;s yet another big psychological operation concocted by the elite in order to discredit/mock the conspiracy community. Of course the true belief system of these elites is sun worship, which would imply that a. Our solar system really does look the way it does. and b. All scientific achievement (NASA included) is a way of figuratively and literally reaching the stars and achieving immortality. Think of astro-theology, how all of our religious stories are metaphors for the constellations. And how this applies to our space missions: Apollo, Gemini, Saturn, etc.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t that science is a lie, the problem is that science is real and these occultists are using it for their own goals. A good example of this would be how Nikola Tesla, who was an actual outsider, had his work covered up by the powers that be. And we used Edison&#39;s invention instead, who I&#39;m willing to bet was a freemason himself. Elon Musk models his own career after Edison&#39;s, despite his company being called &quot;Tesla&quot;.</p>

<p>Nope. If it was we would expect the power lines to shrink into the Horizon not curve. </p>

<p>That&#39;s an octagon, it&#39;s   clearly not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lights in the sky are not earth curvature, not sure why you threw that one in again lol. </p>

<p>Not exactly. It shows the sun is very far away and we orbit it. If it were far it would shrink as it moved to the horizon, it doesn&#39;t. This supports that its large and far not near and small. Also since it moves 15 degrees an hour it shows the sun doesn&#39;t circle us as the FE azimuthal map suggests. </p>

<p>Flat earthers pretend the &quot;vanishing point&quot; explains why things go below the horizon, and that video directly disproves that.<br/>
Do you know why the original flat earther deleted it? Because he realized it proved him wrong, but instead of actually using his brain and the evidence that the earth was round, he deleted and ignored it. LOL</p>

<p>You can shoot down strawmen if you want, I didn&#39;t say anything about law of perspective, but you can&#39;t really deny that there is a vanishing point to perspective can you? And objects do shrink into the distance. This can be seen in the video above as well. </p>

<p>Then why can we see the pylons curve? With a point of reference, yes, we can see them curve. See: that image.</p>

<p>I hope you realize the &quot;P900&quot; is a meme to make fun of flat Earthers, right?</p>

<p>that there is a vanishing point to perspective can you</p>

<p>Vanishing point how? Be specific. If that were the case here they&#39;d disappear into the distance, and the pylon at the far end wouldn&#39;t be visible.  </p>

<p>So we&#39;ve established the &quot;vanishing point&quot; is a myth and they cannot be brought back by zooming in, that it&#39;s not atmospheric distortion (see soundlys Lake Pontchartrain playlist).  </p>

<p>It&#39;s curvature.</p>

<p>Why do you have to make things up when youre proven wrong? I don&#39;t get it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Once again flat earthers completely fail to even grasp what they&#39;re arguing. How are you going to measure or observe a difference of several inches from 50+ miles away, especially when tilted away?</p>

<p>And what maths specifically are you using to determine how much it would be tilted?</p>

<p>Something we can observe however is the fact that the base of the building is below the horizon - empirical evidence of curvature.</p>

<p>Interesting you&#39;d being up &quot;tilting at an angle&quot; - did you know the Verrazano–Narrows Bridge in New York and the Humber Bridge in England, must take into account the Earth&#39;s curvature? In the case of the Verrazano, its two towers are 1 5⁄8 inches farther apart at their tops than at their bases.<br/>
Further proof of the earth&#39;s curvature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought everybody learned about perspective and coverging lines at the horizon </p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL how does that explain things disappearing behind the horizon? Those pylons don&#39;t disappear off into the distance, do they? You can use them as a reference point to visibly observe the curvature. Perspective has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Ironically you&#39;ve displayed your own ignorance of the subject rather than mine when you think it&#39;s relevant LOL</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve yet to debunk it. I could talk about the different star constellations, flight paths, two pole stars, seeing the ISS overhead for myself, but none of those are even needed when you&#39;ve failed so miserably to even debunk this one LOL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely understand what a vanishing point is lol, you seem to think you can repeat it over and over like every other flat earther and think its relevant - it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Can you explain specifically how &quot;perspective&quot; or a &quot;vanishing point&quot; would make things appear to curve over the horizon?</p>

<p>And yes, pictures ARE empirical evidence. The definition of empirical evidence is evidence we can gather from observations. We can gather from that image plus the hour+ footage on Soundlys channel that the pylons curve over the horizon, that there is no atmospheric distortion, and the magic &quot;vanishing point&quot; is not responsible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A vanishing point is a point on the image plane of a perspective drawing where the two-dimensional perspective projections (or drawings) of mutually parallel lines in three-dimensional space appear to converge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Wikipedia.<br/>
Absolutely nowhere on the article does it mention things appearing to curve over a horizon.</p>

<p>Unless Wikipedia osnin on the conspiracy too LOL</p>

<p>So now that we&#39;ve debunked atmospheric distortion and the &quot;vanishing point&quot;, all that&#39;s left is the earth is a globe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it doesn&#39;t. Not at all. Did you even watch it?</p>

<p>I have a feeling you send me links hoping I won&#39;t watch it, that I&#39;ll assume it explains it and move on, because if you actually did watch it you&#39;d know that the idiot who made it doesn&#39;t even understand what a pole star or a rotational axis is.</p>

<p>If it explains it (it doesn&#39;t), can you explain to me how this so called &quot;reflective dome&quot; makes it so there are two constellations of stars dependent on your hemisphere?</p>

<p>How does it account for the fact that a flat plane can only ever have one rotational axis?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t, you&#39;re just repeating nonsense because I think you know there&#39;s no way that can be explained on a flat earth. It singlehandedly destroys the flat earth. Sorry.</p>

<p>No it does not. The axis of rotation is the line perpendicular to the plane of which it&#39;s rotating. It&#39;s IMPOSSIBLE for a flat earth to have two, and the very fact that you think a reflective dome &quot;creates two axis&quot; proves that you have no idea what an axis of rotation even means.</p>

It&#39;s yet another classic example of a flat earther misunderstanding the very principle he&#39;s trying to prove, he blubbers about the pole star but completely fails to explain how the entire southern constellation appears to rotate around a fixed point.</p>

<p>Notice how he also conveniently fails to provide any proof whatsoever about this magical &quot;reflective dome&quot;? Lol the earth being under a dome used to be a joke and now you have people actually believing it, it&#39;s hilariously sad.</p>

<p>Much like you, I think you deliberately chose to misunderstand the vanishing point so you could repeat it ad neasueum as a pathetic excuse, rather than actually employing your brain to explain why things curve over a horizon.</p>

<p>So I ask again, why is there 2 pole stars and two separate constellations? Why do they appear to rotate around 2 fixed points, that would require two rotational axis when the flat earth only has one?</p>

<p>And no, the Sigma Octantis is a south pole star. It&#39;s around 1 degree off the rotational axis, similar to polaris. Not possible on a flat plane.</p>

<p>No, it fucking does not. I did watch it, and it doesn&#39;t cover it whatsoever. Instead what it is someone making up whatever they want to try and make the flat earth work - what actual scientific process involves is taking what we can observe (two constellations, two pole stars, visible curvature) and fitting the model of the earth around that.<br/>
What flat earthers do is make up their flat earth model and desperately try whatever they can, even if it involves making up a magic sky dome to try and make their &quot;model&quot; work.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really sad, not to mention the guy provides zero proof of the &quot;reflective dome&quot; on the first place<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL atmospheric distortion.</p>

<p>Do you have any proof it&#39;s atmospheric distortion?</p>

<p>Soundly has over an hour of footage of Lake Pontchartrain on his channel, from different angles including from above with a drone, which proves beyond a doubt it&#39;s NOT&quot;atmospheric distortion&quot;.</p>

<p>It absolutely is empirical evidence of the curvature, I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re so sadly entrenched in your delusion you need to lie and make things up to protect it.</p>

<p>These are variables that must be accounted for and why empirical evidence from direct measurements on earth curvature are required and not just pictures of things, as you could find pictures where objects can be seen at a much longer distance higher than they should be on a round earth and that could very well be an effect of looming, and why that wouldn&#39;t be evidence for flat earth. </p>

<p>You can observe the pylons curving over the horizon.</p>

<p>What proof do you have it&#39;s &quot;atmospheric distortion&quot;?</p>

<p>That very definitely proves it is not &quot;atmospheric distortion&quot;. Try again.</p>

<p>Not to mention you&#39;ve still yet to explain how it&#39;s atmospheric distortion. Posting Wikipedia links isn&#39;t proof lmao.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Like what?</p>

<p>Those images (both of them) are clear evidence of things disappearing behind the horizon.<br/>
We&#39;ve established it&#39;s not so called &quot;perspective&quot; or the magical &quot;vanishing point&quot; because they don&#39;t disappear into the distance, and we&#39;ve established it&#39;s not &quot;atmospheric distortion&quot;.</p>

<p>The only option left is curvature. It&#39;s up to you to prove it&#39;s &quot;atmospheric distortion&quot; (lol) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;ve been poisoning the well nonstop for the last 50 years. Conspiracy theory attracts a certain kind of person - the type that is distrustful of the &#39;common knowledge&#39; and doesn&#39;t trust authority. Conspiracy buffs also tend to be pretty complex thinkers. There are varying degrees to this, of course, but in my experience almost everyone I&#39;ve met who enjoys learning about conspiracies is above average intelligence and highly creative. But some go a little further than others. Once they&#39;ve opened their eyes to all the lies they&#39;ve been told, they get a little bit too eager to find more and more of them. I have fallen into this trap myself a few times, and I learned from it.</p>

<p>I believe there are theories out there that were specifically designed to A) attract a subset of conspiracy theorists, and B) make the entire endeavor seem wacky, thus allowing the powers that be to paint all conspiracy theories with the same broad brush.  Flat earth, &quot;lizard people&quot;, and a ton of the UFO theories fall into this category. I don&#39;t blame people for going a bit overboard sometimes. We all spot patterns and use those patterns to jump to conclusions. Some of us just get hyper-focused on certain conclusions and wind up letting our guard down when something that seems to confirm our biases crops up.</p>

<p>And I think for a lot of people, the &#39;big picture&#39; remains elusive. Okay, so there are conspiracies, but how do they tie in to one another? Is there a shadowy group pulling the strings? Is it aliens? Illuminati? And then someone crafts a story explaining that everything is a lie, and nothing you&#39;ve been taught is true. And since you&#39;ve trained yourself to be so distrusting of authority, you&#39;re a bit inclined to believe it. The allure of &#39;hidden knowledge&#39; takes over, and you get really engrossed in their explanation. How incredible would it be if the earth really was flat, and we&#39;re all just so brainwashed that we don&#39;t even know it?!?! And bam, that&#39;s enough intrigue to get maybe 1/1000 people really into the idea. After all, almost all of modern history has turned out to be a lie, so why can&#39;t this too? So now the bigger picture is coming together - we&#39;re all pawns in a game much larger than we can imagine, and we&#39;re all being lied to about the very nature of the ground we walk on. And there&#39;s an explanation that creates just enough plausibility that a confused person might grab onto it, hoping to make sense of everything.</p>

<p>And, of course, the media will report on the wackiest of the wacky theories, just to make sure that all the normies know that this whole &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; community is something they shouldn&#39;t waste their time on. They&#39;re all &#39;tinfoil hat crazies&#39; over there. They think the earth is flat and that aliens blew up the twin towers and that bigfoot killed Kennedy. And that provides just enough social pressure for them to stay away, or at least not talk about it openly where others might hear and mistake them for &#39;one of the crazy ones&#39;.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a number of people that I will never ever listen to that are in the FE camp but, much of that has to do with the same issues that hit any group of diverse people - we do not all fit a mold! </p>

<p>Between 9/11, DEW and MudFossils, CulturalLayer, multiple religions etc (as well as the raging push back on FE!)  I&#39;ve been taken back to School to figure out I got fed a whole bunch of lies. </p>

<p>What do you mean &quot;If I recall correctly?&quot;. What&#39;s your evidence of this? Why would the Japanese use NASA&#39;s &quot;Blue Marble data set&quot;?</p>

<p>See how they are capable of putting weather patterns over a globe model? It&#39;s just rendering the images over a sphere.</p>

<p>Heres the video frame with the evidence of them using NASA&#39;s blue marble data set. </p>

<p>How can you even claim that &quot;it&#39;s closest to what it would actually look like&quot;?</p>

<p>I mean, IF we were on a globe, that is the most realistic feed we&#39;d get because they at least have the correct weather patterns so we know some of it is real. </p>

<p>You&#39;re claiming no real photos of Earth exist. How do you know what does and does not look like Earth? By what metric are you judging these photos?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay let&#39;s break this down. </p>

<p>1) The video showed an ftp server for the NOAA, not the organization that operates Himawari-8 (the JMA). Why are we dealing with the NOAA?  </p>

<p>2) The quote from the video.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the images in the archive use the underlying colored land images from the NASA Blue Marble data set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Versus the quote from the site. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All images <em>in the GOES archive</em> are processed in McIDAS using GOES channel 1
visible and GOES channel 4 infrared data. The underlying colored land image is
from the NASA Blue Marble Next Generation data set. When using this basemap
for web or other publications, please provide the following credit line: The
basemap was provided by the Earth Observatory Team - NASA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The images that they are referencing are images like the ones found in <a href="ftp://ftp.nnvl.noaa.gov/GOES/FullDisk/GOESWest/">ftp://ftp.nnvl.noaa.gov/GOES/FullDisk/GOESWest/</a>, which are used to clearly map weather patterns against a basemap (the Blue Marble data set). Obviously, these aren&#39;t the ones claimed to be true color images of Earth. Furthermore, NOAA only makes images like these for the GOES satellites, not Himawari. </p>

<p>3) The series of images he claimed were &quot;weather predictions for the next ~100 years&quot; are not predicting weather. They are predictions of surface temperature. For gods sake, it even says &quot;Predicted Surface Air Temperature&quot; on the webpage. </p>

<p>4) The two pictures he compares very clearly do not match completely. It&#39;s especially obvious near the top right. I believe the image originates from this site. </p>

<p><a href="https://darktarget.gsfc.nasa.gov/himawari">https://darktarget.gsfc.nasa.gov/himawari</a></p>

<p>Which provides a solid summary of what you&#39;re looking at. </p>

<p>5) &gt; &quot;How do they know where to put the clouds and weather on a part of the globe with no sunlight?&quot;. 
Because it&#39;s Imager has like, 13 other observing bands that specifically go into the Infrared. </p>

<p>6) If this was an archive that clearly showed deception, why the hell would they keep it up? </p>

<p>Do you have a source? You can watch the launch for yourself as well as hours of live footage. Sorry, it&#39;s not fake.</p>

<p>The Himawari-8 is a great example of space images. It&#39;s in geostationary orbit (so non-composite images), is Japanese (not NASA) and uploads every 10 minutes (so isn&#39;t CGI).</p>

<p>Not to mention you can do your own research to find out yourself the earth very obviously is not flat. Why do you need a government agency to tell you it&#39;s round? Do your own research and you&#39;ll reach that conclusion as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two kinds of people or two ways to group them, when it comes to alternative theories.</p>

<p>In one group, you have believers. These people believe in things for a variety of reasons. But the key is that they <em>believe</em>.</p>

<p>The other group is made up of thinkers. They eventually come to believe in something different because existing explanations, theories or narratives don&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>The Flat Earth society can then be seen as a sort of litmus test. People who like to believe (or participate without really believing) because of some novelty factor are what you&#39;ll find in the FE society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well done, you got something right!</p>

<p>Yes, it is because NYC and Instanbul are on the same latitude!<br/>
They&#39;re in the same northern hemisphere!</p>

<p>Rio, despite being around the same distance away, is in the southern hemisphere. So the <em>curvature</em> of the globe makes it impossible to view the stars that would normally be visible in NYC or Instanbul.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You&#39;ve just proved the earth is a globe!</p>

<p>I know it might be scary to actually use your brain as a flat earther, but I&#39;m proud of you.</p>
