        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When does the Congress of The United States of America stand united on anything? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRf1cdw4IAY">The answer to that is an easy one for anyone who is paying attention at all</a>.  Anyone reading today&#39;s headlines surely must see that the Government of the USA and its military is doing its best to make Israel&#39;s fondest wishes come true - a war which Israel imagines will give Israel full control of The Middle East.  The bells of war cannot be unrung but they can be stopped from ringing.  There are many in the US Government who actually believe the biblical nonsense of the New Testament that a war which engulfs the planet is <strong><em>Supposed</em></strong> to happen to fulfill a biblical revelation before their Christ can return to Earth and all the rest of the bunk about establishing a new kingdom on earth.</p>

<p>War by the USA against Russia is not the way forward, everyone.  Zionist Government of the USA is not the way forward, either.  The people of the USA need to get their heads screwed on real good and take control of their country back, real fast, or they are going to forever lose their cherished dreams.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how we resist and defeat Zionist control of people and countries, by talking about it, by taking a public stand against it.  We can never be free, equal, or safe, in Palestine or in the USA (or Canada), until we demand freedom, equality and safety.  No government, no military, can make us free, equal or safe.  Only we people can do this.  Governments and military forces which proclaim that they can make us free, equal and safe are lying to us, hoping that they can take our freedom, equality and safety from us.

<p>It is a matter of formality. From Israel&#39;s perspective, all Jews are &quot;Israeli&quot; as a matter of birthright, regardless of where they were born, or happen to reside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the things that really gets my goat is the way that virtually all newly elected members of the US Senate and House of Representatives are taken off to Israel in the month of August preceding their &#39;debut&#39; in Congress in the following month of September.  They are always shepherded by fellow Zionist members of Congress and during this week-long &#39;visit&#39; to Israel are given their instructions, are told what is expected of them.</p>

<p>Another thing which really gets my goat is the way the campaign finance laws are constructed so that Zionist money flows toward candidates who acknowledge fealty toward Israel and against candidates who do not acknowledge fealty toward Israel.  </p>

<p>When the Zionists make the rules we end up with an election system which virtually guarantees that Zionists get elected and the laws which are made favor the Zionists among all others, and the interests of the people of America are neglected.  This was clearly established ever 100 years ago when the Federal Reserve was created by Congress.</p>

<p>This is true, and it is a belief spinned-off of the craziest messianists, the ones who are probably responsible for the “end-times” propaganda being spewed against all denominations.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad_messianism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad_messianism</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept that the Messiah can come at any given moment is a basic tenet of Judaism. The idea that the leader of a Hasidic group could be the Messiah is a nuanced and complex idea that traces itself back to the times of the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism. During Rabbi Schneerson’s life many Jews hoped that he would be the Messiah. This idea gained great vocal attention during the last years of Schneerson life. During those years, there were strong forces within the Chabad–Lubavitch movement, led by the two executors of Schneerson&#39;s will; Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, and Rabbi Abraham Shemtov, resisting the messianic movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People should realize the “end times” propaganda is being <em>heavily</em> pushed with all denominations. Everyone is probably aware of how prominent it has become among protestant Christians in the US in these past years... but also realize it is (by definition) the key precept of (theosophic) New Age, and that  Muslims are <em>also</em> being bombarded with talk about the “Dajjal”, “Mahdi”, and impending “Yawm al-Qiyāmah”.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_eschatology">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_eschatology</a></p>

<p>Even some of the battles in Syria were carried out and timed to match Islamic eschatology. This is why they destroyed Palmyra btw. End-times is central in the Islamic State’s propaganda (and we all know who is behind IS, right?). </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>There are many in the US Government who actually believe the biblical nonsense of the New Testament that a war which engulfs the planet is Supposed to happen to fulfill a biblical revelation before their Christ can return to Earth </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think that is how it works. The bible says that all kingdoms are controlled by Satan. It is he who knows when his time is running out and it is his goal to bring about war, take control and try to destroy Israel. There might be a rennet of people who want war to bring about there messiah but most of those people do not believe in the bible but the book of Islam which Satan wrote. Actual Christians in the US government who are true Christians would do these evil things to try and bring Christ to earth because if they did Christ would come and destroy them. These people are evil. There are so many more signs besides for war that have been taking place. Too many to count.</p>

<p>I am not sure who the fake jews are but something biblical is happening. I actually have a hard time believing that Israel is as evil has people say it is. I think there is a bigger agenda going on. I think Satan has been here studying humans for so long and he is so much smarter than anyone will ever understand. All these conspiracy&#39;s probably don&#39;t even scratch the surface of the truth. </p>

<p>Satan is the author of confusion. </p>

<p>seriously read through <a href="https://prophecywatchers.com/project-jehovah-satan-controls-human-government/">this</a> and you will see how the book of Daniel explains how fallen angels control human government. You will also see how our own government likes to name secret projects called &quot;Jehovah&quot; These things are not by coincidence.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for trying to help. It seems though that it takes a bit of thinking and study of the bible&#39;s contents see that &#39;The bible says that all kingdoms are controlled by Satan&#39;, I just wondered if there is a place (or a few places) that put it quite as starkly as you did.</p>

<p>I got that evil forces (Satan?) intrude into governments but I&#39;m wary of either considering it in such an absolute way as to say they are under Satan&#39;s control, or interpreting that the bible has put it quite as simply and strongly as you said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bible plainly says that Satan is the God of this world. It does not plainly say that fallen angels are in control of governments. However, most of the things the bible says does not come right out and say it. You have to observe through scenarios in the bible. Like reading the book of Daniel or the book of Job. This is why the bible says to study it. This is also why Jesus says things are hidden to people who want to remain ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To all Israeli Jews we say, denounce and renounce your Zionist leaders, for just as they sold you out to Hitler and his 150,000 Jewish soldiers, they will sell you out once more to be butchered.</p>

<p>First, do not think for a minute that they have your best interest at heart. No government in the world has the best interest of their people at heart. Otherwise why have they led you into a country under false pretense and brainwashed you to hate all your Muslim neighbors, when you are surrounded on all sides by these very neighbors? Where will you run to when all hell breaks loose? Into the sea? Isn’t that what they’ve been telling you over and over, that “they” want to run the Jews into the sea?</p>

<p>With that meme they’re getting you accustomed to that very idea for when it actually happens. The sea is the only place where they have not created enemies for you, and they would if they could. They want to watch you flail and drown, while they fly away in their private jets to Switzerland after they have stolen all your money and transferred it to some tax haven, only to reinvent themselves somewhere else. Ask George Soros how he did it during World War 2.</p>

<p>Second, your country Israel is a mess: Ashkenazim and European Jews discriminate against Sephardic and African Jews, as they control most everything in the country;  Russian Jews, who are mostly pretend Jews, escaped the Soviet Union, courtesy of the US, and now constitute a fifth column; Orthodox Jews hate all the non-religious Jews and vice versa; Israeli Arabs are kept as third-class citizens, with Sephardic and North African Jews as second class, and Black African Jews as no class; most Israeli Jews hate the Palestinians, either in the occupied territories or within Israel itself, and would love to excise them from the land, while the Palestinians, under the weight of 70 years of ruthless occupation, would love to see you finally leave, so they could become free from your Apartheid.</p>

<p>Third, your leaders always turn intransigent when America and the world try to coax them into making peace: Have they forgotten the stain that the Crusades left on Christianity? Do they not remember how those Crusades ended? Have they no knowledge of history to understand how empire after empire lost Palestine? Do they even ask themselves what their own Crusade will leave behind this time? Have they not witnessed what happened to Apartheid South Africa? And most importantly, why do they not make a just and lasting peace with all of their neighbors, even if they lose considerable land? Isn’t peace better?</p>

<p>Together with imperial America, your Zionist leaders have ignited the suffering of millions of innocents, Christians and Muslims, who are presently living in torment, not only in Palestine but throughout the Middle East, while you sit there, do nothing, and even applaud.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this has been orchestrated in order to create a cauldron they hope to pour on all the inhabitants of the area, you Israelis included.</p>

<p>In conclusion, when all hell breaks loose and fire starts raining on your heads, you’ll have only yourselves to blame. Because you colluded with your leaders.</p>

<p>“Whoever digs a pit will fall into it and whoever rolls a stone, it will roll back on them.” Proverbs 26:27</p>
