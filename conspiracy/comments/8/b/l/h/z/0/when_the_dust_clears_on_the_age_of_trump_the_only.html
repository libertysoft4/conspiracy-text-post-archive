        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Every President, no matter how controversial they were in their time, is looked upon more fondly after leaving the White House. You can find glowing opinions on Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W Bush in the same mainstream press that was hell bent on destroying their Presidencies. The people who once called Bush &#39;Hitler&#39; forgot about it all once they were told to hate the &#39;new Hitler&#39;. Maybe not the activists but the more forgiving rank and file. </p>

<p>The same will happen with Trump. He&#39;s too fascinating of a personality and story for there not to be a more positive reappraisal of him at some point. His populist agenda makes him more of a folk hero, if anything. Historians and those from a distance judge their marks more even-handed than contemporary journalists pushing an agenda. </p>

<p>That being said, what is the end game of those trying to bring him down? They clearly don&#39;t have anything on Russia so are now trying to dig up dirt about women, testing his patience, baiting him to fire Mueller. If they did have something on Trump, they aren&#39;t going to let him be President for two and a half years before they could even conceivably impeach him. He is already deciding major international moves and determining future US policy. He has already turned the GOP, the party of the Deep State interests (MIC/Israel/CIA/FBI/strong law enforcement), into the party of Trump based on polling. Nothing they have done has eroded this support and any move made against him is essentially a move against the two-party system. </p>

<p>Either Trump did something very bad to warrant this or his enemies did something that Trump is standing in the way of. If all they have after a year is Trump fucking a pornstar and paying her off (legal or not), this entire investigation is a debacle and only the people pushing it come out badly in the end. They got rid of Trump but at the cost of revealing the partisan nature of federal government. People will forget about Trump&#39;s negative aspects but they won&#39;t be able to forget that. </p>

<p>It all seems short sighted to me unless there actually was some major conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ehh i&#39;m not so sure that means much.</p>

<p>yeah pence would be prez, but if trump is impeached before the elections this november, there will be a major blue wave in congress and senate. trump impeachment makes GOP look really bad.</p>

<p>so it would be pence with a majority democrat house + senate. he wouldn&#39;t be able to accomplish much of anything (similar to obama from 2010 on with repub. majority)</p>

<p>2020 would probably be a toss up though, considering the Dems have no one to run against Trump, or Pence in this situation.</p>

<p>This is demonstrably false. Evidence all over the place. Every time somebody chimes in with a &quot;I wish Bush was back&quot; post, they get corrected. Usually by somebody old enough to remember Bush II clearly and can clearly recall all the mayhem, damage, deaths, and criminal behavior of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, and Gonzalez. </p>

<p>Trump is an absolute blowhard, idiot, criminal, and agent of the Russian government. But he hasn&#39;t killed nearly as many as Bush II or wasted as much in pointless wars...yet.   </p>

<p>I voted for Bush and don&#39;t understand why Trump has been singled out here. The people who hate Bush and lots of people who claim to have hated Hillary/Obama are aligned against Trump&#39;s base. Is it his populism they dislike? Is that why they took Bernie down in the DNC primaries as well? </p>

He has absolutely no idea how to hire staff to run a white house in which he has no idea what he&#39;s doing. His daily schedule looks similar to my grandfather&#39;s who has dementia and is in a nursing home. He&#39;s treating the presidency like a part time job that allows him to golf every weekend. There are a LOT of reasons on every side of the isle that people hate Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is plenty of anger at what he&#39;s doing. For example DACA. Trump decided to end the program that Obama created without a safety net or solution put in place. Should legislation have been created to permanently affect DACA recipients before he was president? Yes. But what he did was the wrong thing to do. He ended the program stating that congress needed to come up with a resolution and he would sign it. Congress did that and he refused to agree to it because it wasn&#39;t what he wanted.
Second example. The Tax bill. This is extremely controversial and maybe you can&#39;t blame him as much because congress wrote it. He&#39;s taking ownership, so I blame him. The claims that were made about by the GOP about the bill are demonstrably false. The newest projections how that the federal deficit is rising much higher than previously because of the tax bill.
His quick uninformed decision making can be criticized easily. One of his first acts as president was to pull out of the TPP. Now we see today that he is looking into entering into the TPP. He has no idea why he pulled out but realizes that a trade partnership is beneficial for the U.S. If he wanted to negotiate trade terms he should have done that. He didn&#39;t. He cried like a child and took his ball home.
I could literally go on for hours about specific policy examples and why people are mad about them. This is not JUST personal. Many people hate him for his character. Many hate him for his policies. Many hate him for all of those reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are a nation of laws. if trump committed crime, he should be charged and convicted. your argument that &quot;oh, even if it was illegal, it&#39;s not that bad&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s ok because history will remember him fondly after a good white washing!&quot; is completely antithetical to everything this nation stands for and you should be ashamed of yourself. you and those like you among trump&#39;s base are exactly why i left the republican party(after being a member for 20 years!)</p>

<p>I could stomach the neocons in the bush administration, I felt confident we could recover despite the disastrous wars and mismanaged economy. but this new lot of so called conservatives are anti-democratic. they have undermined the very institutions that gave us such freedoms we all enjoy. we have governors refusing to hold elections. we have federal agencies under the administration of individuals who have multiple continuing lawsuits against the agencies they now control. <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/youth-camps-shape-new-generations-with-patriotism-pushups-and-prayer/">There are militant youth camps growing in my own backyard with the stated purpose of indoctrinating kids with &quot;americanism&quot; in the hopes that they will enlist so that they&#39;ll have &quot;insiders&quot; in the military that is supposed to protect us all, who consider anyone who disagrees with them the &quot;enemy.&quot;</a></p>

<p>We have a group of officials in power, and many more running elections on platforms where they are unashamed to say &quot;god wants only christians to rule over america.&quot; in case you missed it... these people think they are your rulers. we don&#39;t have rulers in america, we have elected public servants. betsy devos, the woman in charge of our children&#39;s education, is a member of the dominionist movement. this movement&#39;s stated purpose is to &quot;make every thought obedient to christ.&quot; i&#39;m not kidding. go look em up, they&#39;ll tell you this proudly. their purpose is to &quot;transfer the wealth from the wicked to the righteous and make every thought in the land obedient to christ.&quot; and guess who gave these people the keys to the nation? </p>

<p>but i suppose that doesn&#39;t make a difference to people like you, so long as it &quot;triggers the libs.&quot; do you not see that? &quot;trump&#39;s base&quot; is almost entirely motivated by harassing and even punishing half of america simply for having a difference of opinion. you&#39;ll lose the nation, but thank god he made a few liberals angry, right guys!? the man himself, during the campaign, even invited/encouraged a hostile foreign power to attack the united states because it might benefit him... and here you are saying &quot;it&#39;s not that bad.&quot; which brings me back to my main point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead, they revealed themselves and won&#39;t ever be able to take that back in the minds of half the country</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. it is you who have revealed yourselves.  and that is exactly why you&#39;re engaging in this little fan fiction of yours. you hope that history will forget how quickly you all abandoned your principles for whatever red meat you were promised. and for your sake, i hope they do... but that&#39;s only because, unlike most trump supporters, i&#39;m not a very vindictive person</p>
