        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay, I may be a little paranoid here, but here&#39;s what I think.</p>

<p>We know discussions generate in Reddit are important. We know the relevance of Reddit on Internet, especially in the USA. On Reddit, many polemical topics and shocking discussions have risen, do I have to mention Pizzagate? I don&#39;t think so. </p>

<p>Anyway, because of its undeniable relevance in social media nowadays, Reddit has infuriated politicians and corporations everywhere. Once again, I have to mention Pizzagate and the ban on the Pizzagate subreddit. </p>

<p>Now, everybody - or at least ALMOST everybody - agrees that the new design is AWFUL. The most attractive thing about Reddit was its amazing usability - it was easy to use, fast to load, and simple. Simplicity attracts people. Complexity repels everybody.</p>

<p>Now you can still opt for the old version. But for how long? What if one day they force us to use only the new version? </p>

<p>Right now if a new user accesses Reddit, they won&#39;t see the old version. They&#39;ll see the new one. That new version is basically trashy. It&#39;s not discussion-friendly. If I entered Reddit for the first time and saw the new design, I wouldn&#39;t even sign up. It makes everything look tiring. </p>

<p>So, IMO, the best way to end Reddit as a whole, to repel users and to end all this political discussion, is forcing people to use this horrible design. Don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll ever force us to use only the new version, but if they do, I can definitely see the end of Reddit happening. </p>

<p>It might have started out that way. But reddit turned into something a lot more interesting. It&#39;s a kind of digital nexus. A place where a bunch of factors interact.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got every kind of subreddit where there is a regular flow of information.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got a bunch of semi-autistic people like me who live in this sea of info.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got all kinds of other people who come to take part in their own online communities.</p>

<p>Then you&#39;ve got all these people, with access to all this information... and suddenly they&#39;re networking with each other.</p>

<p>A conspiracy theorist used to be one lonely guy (with a theory) slowly accumulating facts, stories and evidence over years of time. Now, you&#39;ve got thousands of people doing the same thing at the same time. And the second one person finds something or gets an inspiration, they share it with thousands of others in a matter of hours.</p>

<p>You could think of reddit as a tool, used by a team of do-it-yourself analysts, to put things together the same way an intel team does. Except we&#39;re doing it for free and there&#39;s a lot more of us.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re a big enough pain in the ass (figuring shit out all the time) they would gladly disfigure reddit in a way that makes it less useful... even if it cost them money to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like the theory but I will shoot one at ya. Think about how people on here up/down vote other users and main topics and include comment and private messages. If you take all of that in what can that build on anonymous users. A psychological profile. People can use that here in the near future and use that against the common folk.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. I dare say we all have our psychological profiles recorded already, at least a scratch of them. </p>

<p>I just read the book &quot;The Psycopath Test&quot; by Jon Rosh and there he talks, among other things, about his conversations with David Shayler, who used to work for the MI-5. Shayler mentioned that the MI-5 had the file about a middle school boy that e-mailed the Communist Party asking about Communism for a school project. I mean, if they have files about middle school students, they can have files about you and me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what half of conspiracy theorists think about the planes. Me I personally think that the towers were not earthquake proof and we knew that. 185 miles away is a very late fault line. You have a eq that big it could have enough force to shake the buildings causing them to fall into one another. Why not always have explosives loaded in those towers as an insurance measure not to fall into other building. Ram a giant plane into the building to set off explosives and have the tower comedown onto itself. </p>

<p>I can totally see that happening. Now the thing is, some people say <strong>there were no airplanes hitting the towers that day.</strong> I mean, there were witnesses. The entire city witnessed that. I can&#39;t buy that theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think the same but if you take the witnesses as people who seen &#39;something&#39; hit the towers instead assuming they are people who seen air liners hit the towers it makes more sense. Would it be hard to disguise a missile as a plane?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I believe the no planes theory but after watching a couple of good videos analysing the tower impacts it did open my mind a bit to the possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said, upvoted, followed. </p>

<p>Consider elon&#39;s statements on reddit, last year in rolling stone he said that sometimes you can find the truth on reddit, which i agree with.  And now he is talking about who owns media and making an internet solution to journalistic credibilty.  </p>

<p>conde naste is as corporate global as you can get, and as it&#39;s gone with every social platform actual individual humans have found effective, their means have always been bought out, controlled, milked for data, and then ruined. </p>

<p>i think elon is noticing what i have been talking about for a long time, that when the internet solves a problem, there tends to be very large forces come in to break that thing again.  Encryption, the linux kernel, video chat, tor, i could really go on and on about this. </p>

<p>in the early 2000&#39;s i tried to publish/self-published a book about this problem, using arthur c. clark&#39;s description of an ship-board debate system described in Songs of Distant Earth.   It is very easy to see in that novel how big of a deal it is when a group of people tries to use a discussion platform, but then someone tampers with it.  In the novel it&#39;s a high crime and huge resources are committed to securing the computer systems and investigating potential security lapses. </p>

<p>Reddit, while basically an obvious model for electronic discussion expanding on the oldest communication idea on the internet, the forum, based upon the physical forum which is thousands of years old and considered a universal pillar of civilization, and we let fucking conde naste run it, an opaque corporation with ties to every other journalistic problem that forces the need for new forms of media in the first place. </p>

<p>And if someone creates something better, voat, saidit, without huge startup capital from the same forces that subverted everything else, or outright giving your owner logins to the fucking CIA, you are going to have a difficult time.  </p>

<p>mindhawk&#39;s nth&#39;s law of the internet: selling control of your creation is destroying your creation.  </p>

<p>and this problem of creating a planetary forum for users, and not corporations, is turning out to be fucking difficult. </p>

<p>sure wish i could hear aaron schwarz&#39;s thoughts on this.  dang i wish he was here right now.    </p>
