<p>Consider the concept of calibration. In science, measuring tools are calibrated to ensure that they remain accurate. A known quantity can be measured, and the accuracy of the measuring device can be determined by comparing its readings with the known quantity.</p>

<p>How can &#39;radiometric dating&#39; be calibrated? How do we know if a device which claims that a rock is 5,000 years old, is accurate? Do we have any rocks which are independently known to be 5,000 years old to test the device?</p>

<p>I have run this past a few people. The responses have been mixed. The critical thinkers have all agreed that this calibration problem is a significant one. The lemmings have all, without fail, replied with comments to the effect of, &#39;trust the experts&#39;.</p>

<p>Why should I have faith in the experts? I don;t even know who these people are. all I know is they get paid to go along with the existing &#39;science&#39;. It is their job.</p>

<p>your strawman is in claiming i&#39;m making a claim about the veracity of the claim.  i am not.  i have repeatedly said this, and you have ignored it.  which tells me that this conversation is over, and hopefully readers of this thread will be able to see the type of wordplay engaged.  cheers!</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need a 5,000 year old base line. You need base lines from maybe 10, 20, and 100 years (not necessarily those exact numbers).

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know what a half life is? Every element that has one (not all do) follows the same pattern, but over a different time frame. Some have half lifes of only a few seconds, so we can measure the entire trend quickly. Others have half lifes of 1000s of years. The data starts out the same as elements with half lives of seconds, minutes, hours, or days. When the same trend occurs consistently over many elements, it&#39;s easy to extrapolate. There is no reason to expect the trend to stop occurring after 1000s of years, unless you&#39;re only doing it for the sake of being contrarian</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I already explained in a previous comment, every half life follows the same curve, just over a different amount of time. If you know what the curve looks like (which you can get from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_radioactive_isotopes_by_half-life">dozens</a> of isotopes with short half lifes) then you need a few data points measures accurately to chart out the next 1000 years. With accurate data, all it takes is plugging the data into an Excel spreadsheet and graphing it. How much time needs to be measured most likely depends on how accurate your equipment doing the measurements is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because literally every fucking one that has been measured follows the same curve. So when we start to measure something with a longer half life and it begins to follow the same curve that the other 100 do, we can extrapolate. It would make zero sense for the curve to suddenly change its course. The curve decreases at a consistent rate.</p>

<p>He does not apply this standard to his own claims, videos or blogs where a youtube clip of hulk hogan in 1989 predicts 9/11, or clips from back to the future predicit 9/11, or his crappy misinterpreted force diagram of a missile proves missiles are fake -&gt; all war is fake etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lets say you have 1 Million atoms of a specific isotope of Plutonium. When a Decay event happens its you can easily measure it by the released energy. Over time you can see how many decay events happened in a given time hence calculate the half-life.</p>

<p>If you are an avid shooter and got yourself a Tritium nightsight (highly recommend them!) you can see this in action. When a tritium atom decays it releases a electron which then hits phosphorous causing the glow. In order to have it just slightly bright you need to know the halflife exactly to calculate how much tritium and phospherous you need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why we trust radiometric dating ? Because no one was able to speed up or slow down the decay of an isotope.</p>

<p>Since this cannot be done neither through natural or artificial means implies that radio active decay is a constant.</p>

<p>Since a constant by definition will never change, there is not much to go on about how radioactive dating is a lie and a conspiracy.</p>

<p>And no we don&#39;t need to calibrate, because radioactibe decay is as simple as taking a watch and once you&#39;re at half value you stop and have the time at which an isotope decays.</p>

<p>Example technetium99 with 6,02 hours. Or Fluor 18 (about 2 hours).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is trying to get you on the fact that you personally did not measure each half life... its an inane approach to life where nothing is real unless you yourself proved it or saw it... therefore making it impossible for any individual to know very much since they would literally have to re-invent and re-test 1000s of years of human knowledge...</p>

<p>He does not apply this standard to his own claims, videos or blogs where a youtube clip of hulk hogan in 1989 predicts 9/11, or clips from back to the future predicit 9/11, or his crappy misinterpreted force diagram of a missile proves missiles are fake -&gt; all war is fake etc...</p>

<p>Its not really much worth arguing with him.</p>
