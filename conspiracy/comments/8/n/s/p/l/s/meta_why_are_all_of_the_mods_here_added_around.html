Why cant we have rules here against mods treating their owns posts specially? Why do calls claiming brigading by regular users get removed but mods can sticky such claims in their own posts?</p>

<p>Just a week or so ago there were top-rated comments here, from people who had never posted before, saying that there is no reason to mistrust the mainstream media and that offensive speech doesn&#39;t count as free speech.</p>

There is one who has used at least 35 different accounts to keep coming back after being banned. Another one has been banned numerous times (including again today) but is never given anything more than a temporary 3 day ban. Brigading can be hard to prove at times but these trolls are 100% transparent and yet they are still allowed to continue. I just don&#39;t get it sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a funny way of determining proof. Everyone still hates Hillary, but she lost, and shrunk back into the shadows like I warned you all she would. Until she starts making more public moves, the person who deserves the most scrutiny is the president, not someone who ran against the president and lost.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t know many republicans, so all I hear and see all day is &quot;fuck Trump&quot;, and this is coming from people I wouldn&#39;t trust my Politics 095 homework with, if you catch my nudge. So yeah, I, like many others here, have taken to the guy a bit more over the last year. Why? Because his detractors are traditionally even more full of shit than he is, which is tremendous!</p>

<p>You could use common ground to relate, or you could finger punt and name call. I don&#39;t care for Trump, and have thought he was a scumbag for over twenty years, as many if us knew of his exploits long before he ran for President (which will never sound natural, calling him president).</p>

<p>It sounds to me like you had hoped for Hillary, or at least for a quiet win from Trump, and now you&#39;re upset. Me, personally, I don&#39;t vote and consider anyone who does vote (or believes in the process) to be at least partially brain dead. Anyone who isn&#39;t critical of elected officials due to party is brain washed, and anyone who likes Hillary is brainless.</p>

<p>It is not a all or nothing game. Of course any party will have power. They won&#39;t have equal power though.</p>

<p>All my point was, is that you shouldn&#39;t think a conspiracy forum has been co-opted when the conspiracies will usually come from the group with the most influence. </p>

Guess the whole families banned now hahaha conspiracy mods at least will reason with you after a week or so to let it cool down. But still kind of shitty mods grab power and act all important with it and reddit doesnt allow a way to have anyone to appeal a mods actions to. Anyone could get so someone in a mod role and delete and ban anything they don&#39;t like and no one can stop them. Its kind of authoritarian and against the 2 creators core for this site.</p>

<p>I&#39;m obviously not who you&#39;re talking about, and I&#39;m not even a mod. BUT..despite the age of this current account, I&#39;ve been a reddit user for going on 11 years and an r/conspiracy user not much less than that.</p>

<p>I only bring that up because this is the <em>only</em> sub I&#39;ve ever been subscribed to where people complain about the mods being very active contributors to the sub they are modding. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that <em>you&#39;re</em> implying the mods here shouldn&#39;t be active contributors altogether. I&#39;m just saying I see that sort of sentiment here <em>a lot</em>, and in my experience not really seen elsewhere. It&#39;s interesting.</p>

<p>I&#39;m reasonably certain the Roundtable discussions are voted on by the users, no? It&#39;s the same with deciding if something gets stickied, except for that the mods vote.</p>

<p>And I get that in your opinion paranormal stuff doesn&#39;t belong here, but the paranormal has been tied to conspiracy theory for as long as conspiracy theory forums have existed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are forums somewhere that are strictly conspiracy, but they are the minority in my experience.</p>

<p>Besides - many people do consider things like the paranormal, supernatural, etc to be conspiracy theories themselves. Many people believe the government knows about aliens, ghosts, other dimensions. They&#39;re intimately attached.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m not entirely sure how things like the paranormal being discussed in a roundtable thread shows mod corruption. Unless that was more of an unrelated rant.</p>
