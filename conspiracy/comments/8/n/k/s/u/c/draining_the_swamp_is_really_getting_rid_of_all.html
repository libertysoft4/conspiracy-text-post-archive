        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With trumps recent tarrifs on the EU for continuing to do business with Iran and israels attack on the EU, we can see who trump is taking orders from. So far he has given Israel Jerusalem, increased their aid from 48 billion to 100 billion, gave them access to our military and state secrets, gutted the UN, and put all their agents into power. Kushner who finances illegal invasion outposts in the west bank just got a 380 million dollar loan from Israel. Bolton Haley Pompeo Kushner Pence Sessions Haspel are all AIPAC members and pro Israel to a poibt of supporting war crimes and giving Israel vomplete access and control of americas foriegn policy. This is the definition of a traitor. </p>

<p>Now that we see Russia and Israel doing so much, its fair to say russia can get Israel to make decisions for Americans in return for favors. We see this with Trump putting Tarrifs on the EU to benefit both Russia and Israel as the EU is both their enemies. We see this when Russia stopped supporting their major ally Iran in favor for Israel American cooperation. We see it in Russia forcing Syria to be weak on the Israel border. If you support Trump, you support religious wars and foriegn hocernments making decisions in americas name, while you the American have 0 say. </p>

<p>Please refrain from religious fights. Israel is a country. Lets talk about them the same as we talk about russia China Germany and so on. They get no special treatment because they are mostly one ethnic group or race the same way mostly white black Christian Islamic Hindu  countries aren&#39;t talked about having special provisions for this. And don&#39;t come on with that israel is the only democracy, it forces a majority so it is not a democracy any different than Iran that forces a majority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its instilled in Jews that hard work and patience pay off. All work is for god. </p>

<p>Ha&#39;am wanted an entirely Jewish culture free of influence separated. Herzl wanted a mixing of people but Jewish representation and protection. Ha&#39;am has won by saying others need to be controlled instead of everyone being equal and holistic and honesty will make others respect Jews so all could live in peace. There is way more to this as they lived a long time ago and since them, other people have changed these philosophies that were the birth of Zionism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been on the same page since I read Fitzpatrick. 4 parts about Trumps devious past and who he aligns with. <a href="https://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/trump-controlled-by-mossad/">https://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/trump-controlled-by-mossad/</a> Do you think Mueller is Americas hope, or is he just part of the theater?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know yet. He hid Saudis role in 9/11 for 12 years. He was bushes guy. He has called out Israel for hacking, working with Cambridge, and selling Intel to UAE Saudi and Russia. As head of FBI he probably knows Israel&#39;s danger and power so he might be scared to hide them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said!  Upvoted, saved.  </p>

<p>I hope the strategists at the pentagon see this, as it looks to all of us here like they get paid to basically do jack shit and turn us all into stooges for a different country.  </p>

<p>trump isn&#39;t just giulty of financial crimes, this is what high treason looks like.</p>

<p>usually i am not for the death penalty, but in the case of treason, i can sometimes make an exception.  </p>

<p>i would settle for life in prison for trump and his entire entourage, but this is what the treason clauses in the law and constitution were meant to refer to.  </p>

<p>also the nuremberg laws apply for what is going on in Yemen, obviously.  And not just yemen, that&#39;s really just the start, considering all the support ISIS got and is getting from the USA and Israel.  </p>

<p>It is as if just enough of the american population was lobotomized to allow someone as stupid as trump to be elected, but he couldn&#39;t have done so without someone as corrupt and incompetent as hillary clinton.  </p>
