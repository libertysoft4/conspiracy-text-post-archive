    <div class="md"><p>I would certainly agree with this. The problem with the genre of conspiracy theory is that it has been fed to us through our television and societal media as entertainment for decades. This programming is now being used to create &quot;brands&quot; or &quot;tribes&quot; within conspiracy theorist communities. </p>

<p>Some of this programming is quite effective. The Q phenomenon can be modeled as a MMORPG, in that the Q followers feel they are participating, that they are part of this drama and narrative that is being crafted for them.</p>

<p>We are only &quot;woke&quot; (and I hate that term) to the extent that we continually question not only the world we see around us, but that world which exists inside us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps I should have said &quot;warring tribes.&quot; I see nothing wrong with people living in tribes, communities, communes, or collectives smaller than the whole species. I think that&#39;s healthy for humans (much healthier than a lot of city life). </p>

<p>My issue is that two tribes (actually quite a few more), nations really, living within the same polity with the same state, where each tribe wields against the other. Picking a side on this, even the &quot;right&quot; side, is a bad fucking idea, because now you&#39;ve pitted yourself against the very people you need to make peace with. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting we all come around the campfire and sing Kumbaya, but we need to stop fighting each other. You lean &quot;conservative&quot;, and I dig that. But making enemies of &quot;liberals&quot; is just making more enemies. You make them dig in to their trenches as you&#39;re in yours, and the misleaders happily collect all our taxes. I would venture to say your actions on this sub have caused more liberals to double down against you than brought supporters to your side. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an information war, mate. If you think you&#39;re gonna win it against those who <em>truly</em> wield power without at least an <em>alliance</em> with the other 50%+ of the population, you&#39;ve already lost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a shite comparison. From your statement we can say some of the universe is filled with matter and some isn&#39;t. 2 states of being. The members of the tiny intersex population still lean more towards one or the other gender individually. It&#39;s like saying 0,018% of people are born with a tail, so now we need a tail acceptance movement and change all of our society to reflect the existence of these tail people.

<p>Fair enough, but for all societal intents and purposes they belong to one of two groups. They are exceptions that don&#39;t need separate sex designations 99% of the time.</p>

<p>Lol, think and speak some more for me. I&#39;m usually the first to admit when I&#39;m wrong and totally open to change my opinions. Not an ideologue. I wholeheartedly agree that I&#39;m no expert on these matters, just  speaking my mind.
Feel free to link some sources and I promise I&#39;ll read em. We&#39;d probably agree on most points in this issue, I just disagree that there are more than 2 sexes. If that wasn&#39;t what you meant I have no issues here </p>

<p>Also English isn&#39;t my first, second or third language so I get terms like sex and gender mixed up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree. However, I think that you have to properly educate yourself on the types of propaganda the MSM puts out before you can properly use them as sources. This would be done by using high-quality alternative media site, such as the Corbett Report, Mint Press News, Consortium News, Common Dreams, The Real News, and Moon of Alabama (blog site, but very good in my experience).</p>

<p>Once you have a foundation of information you can stand on, it is much easier to spot MSM bias, disinformation, and misinformation.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>then there&#39;s the lynch mob who jump you when you try to ask or criticise even just small parts of their theory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience, this group is not very big. On the internet, there is always a vocal minority, e.g. flat earthers. Most people I know IRL who are &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; like me are open to being wrong.</p>

<p>However, it is also my experience that common criticisms from (usually self-proclaimed) skeptics often stem from lack of knowledge on the topics they discuss; I routinely see a-priori reasoning and arguments from incredulity from these types. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that there aren&#39;t good criticisms of course, but they are sadly overshadowed by the former group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This <em>exactly</em> how I feel about the subject. An example of how large a problem this is becoming: yesterday, a fellow posted a study about the psychology behind conspiracism to the subreddit. Its conclusions apparently made many people uncomfortable. So uncomfortable, in fact, that they were attacking it with the very same logical fallacies that are often used to dismiss conspiracy theories. We seem to be forgetting that how much we like a piece of information is <em>not</em> a rating for its validity.</p>

<p>That is EXACTLY why psychology,  by definition, doesn&#39;t fall under the term &quot;science&quot;.  The human mind is not quantifiable.  If you&#39;re  working with subjective &quot;evidence&quot; as opposed to scientifically provable evidence you don&#39;t have a science. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying psychology is worthless, but I am saying it cannot be called a science.</p>

<p>Considering you didn&#39;t know that and think that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>...in full alignment with very popular, but fully incorrect, mainstream misconceptions says to me that you&#39;re  actually the one who &quot;doesn&#39;t really know much about it&quot;.</p>

<p>There are now over thirty schools of psychology, some of which advocate ideas which are 180 degrees away from some others! Some psychologists even admit that “psychology has its fair share of pseudo-science.”</p>

<p>This medley of contradictory – even pseudo-scientific – ideas in and of itself should prove that psychology is not a science.</p>

<p>Each new discovery is heavily dependent on some of the discoveries made earlier. Physics is an unbroken chain of discoveries, each link held tightly to the previous and next links.</p>

<p>This cannot be said about psychology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re incorrect.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t avoid certain types of information.  I absorb whatever comes my way and make decisions based on the entirety of it, using critical thinking to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<p>Information filters are for those afraid to explore reality for fear of finding something which doesn&#39;t  agree with their imagined reality. This is another reason the average person takes the words of someone with a degree as gospel....   They&#39;re scared to investigate and question for themselves.</p>

<p>TL;DR. I expose myself to material and information from all camps of thought on any particular subject before arriving at personal conclusions of belief.   Most people don&#39;t do that,  and I can tell you do not do that either. </p>

<p>You already think you &quot;know&quot; too much to learn anything new. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t give much of a shit at all about the whole &quot;not definable as science&quot; debate. I only brought it up because the circle-jerking between  OP and his mini-me sidekick was too funny to not poke a stick at.</p>

<p>Steeped in their self-assured superiority revelations about how critical thinking in this sub is so limited,  they seemed to be oblivious to their own hypocrisy. </p>

<p>I mention that psychology doesn&#39;t fall under the definition of science and they LOSE THEIR SHIT without being able to concede that my perspective isn&#39;t any less valid than theirs.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a settled debate,  yet, they deny the debate has any merit at all because it upsets their feels. </p>

<p>From their perspective,  they&#39;re unquestionably right because they adhere to mainstream thought and I&#39;m wrong because  I frequent this sub. OP only came here to smear shit on the walls. </p>

<p>What I had to say made them uncomfortable because it disrupted the way they want to view things, but,  they were blind to their own hypocrisy about it.  Ultimately,  their egos are more fragile and their worldview more coddled than any veterans here.   They have not yet  been able to admit that, possibly, they don&#39;t know everything... that is the first step to having an open mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a common misconception. While some social psychology research has indeed had issues with conforming to empiricism, psychology as a whole tends to be fairly rigid when it comes to scientific robustness, especially if the &#39;harder&#39; fields like neuropsychology are included.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the debate on wether or not psychology is &quot;a science&quot; has been going for over a century, with very smart people on both sides unable to provide a definitive answer.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a textbook example of the centrist fallacy right there.</p>

<p>It was more the complete lack of argumentation I was complaining about than the statement itself. If you can support your point of view with solid evidence, I&#39;ll be quite happy to change my mind, but I am so far not convinced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is absolutely no reason to fire a Stalin&#39;s organ of insults at me just because we disagree about psychology&#39;s scientific merits. Ad hominems don&#39;t add any strength to your argumentation and only breed needless tension. In fact, I have found that debaters often use personal attacks to conceal the weaknesses in their point of view, so this kind of hostility only <em>detracts</em> from the value of what you are saying. Is it really so hard to be decent in debates instead of immediately executing the other party for the crime of disagreeing with you?</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let&#39;s get back to the discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You do realize that regurgigating incorrect mainstream nonsense like &#39;psychology is science&#39; just because you think following the crowd proves you correct isn&#39;t doing you or your argument any favors, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I was criticising the lack of argumentation of your original comment, not necessarily its content. To not cite evidence for your proposition and instead say that it is the other party&#39;s task to prove the opposite is a clear case of shifting the burden of proof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh shit, I&#39;ve got a mainstream source even someone as narrow minded as you can appreciate. Psychology isn&#39;t science. That is an established FACT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is also an established logical fallacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your persistence in puking up common misconceptions indicate you really are just flying by the seat of your pants concerning this issue, and have never once investigated it yourself. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again a well-crafted ad hominem. If you&#39;re this good at fallacies, imagine what a shining star you could be at actual logic! Maybe you should try it for once.</p>

<p>Yes, I am aware I am indulging in a fallacy myself here, but even my patience has its limits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://skepticaleducator.org/why-psychology-is-not-a-science/">http://skepticaleducator.org/why-psychology-is-not-a-science/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surely the irony of claiming that psychology isn&#39;t a science and then &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;proving&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; that claim with an article that doesn&#39;t even <em>pretend</em> to be a peer-reviewed study doesn&#39;t escape you?</p>

<p>Even if we cast aside that objection, the article itself is fairly mediocre. Early psychology was more a philosophy than it was a science, and to judge the modern fields by its early roots strikes me as more than a little unfair. By that same logic, one should also dismiss chemistry, as it is merely an offshoot of alchemy.</p>

<p>You&#39;re taking a preconceived notion, a generalization, about a small percentage of people here and putting it out as a subtle smear on this sub.  </p>

<p>What percentage of this sub would you  say falls under the category of &quot;the ones that think everything is one big conspiracy, without questioning their own thinking about it&quot;?</p>

<p>You would probably say I&#39;m included in that percentage merely because I have expressed that psychology isn&#39;t,  by definition,  a science... and that upsets you emotionally. </p>

<p>You have your head so far up mainstream&#39;s ass you don&#39;t even question your own thinking because the world reflects your false reality back to you and that is your proof that your way of thinking is superior. </p>

<p>Yes, there are also Trolls, Shills and Agent Provocateurs that prowl these parts, posting and upvoting inflammatory shit to distract and defame the sub and its content.</p>

<p>Maybe it would be helpful if you provided us with some real-life examples of what you see as &quot;right-think&quot; vs &quot;wrong-think&quot; contributions?</p>

<p>You are, after all, asking us to apply &quot;critical thinking&quot;, aren&#39;t you?</p>

<p>Lead by example.</p>

<p>Flat Earth is the go-to example for people trying to improperly conflate this sub with nonsense.   The Flat Earth psy-op perpetrators/victims are an extremely small minority here.  They only tend to appear here in noticeable numbers to discredit the sub. During the election, this sub got 4-5 FE submissions per hour, but they weren&#39;t organic. </p>

<p>Have you considered whether your own confirmation bias is causing you to see inordinate amounts of confirmation bias?</p>

<p>You read flat earther posts?  <strong><em>eeew!</em></strong></p>

<p>Ah, there we are, then. My post and comment history is open. Dig up some examples from my submissions to justify your assertions, and copy-paste them here -- but be sure to include context -- okay? :-)</p>

<p>Is that so? Well then, post some examples in evidence... In the meantime, I think I&#39;ll have a nap.</p>
