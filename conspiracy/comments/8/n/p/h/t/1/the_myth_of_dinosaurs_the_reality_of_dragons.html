<p>Do you realize that dinosaurs are just a theory? A theory that is backed up by very shaky evidence. Most people believe in dinosaurs because they are taught in school about them. Rarely does a school teach the children that dinosaurs are just a theory and are not proven to be fact. What if I were to tell you Dinosaurs are actually a myth? That very statement will cause many of you to laugh. That&#39;s because you have been taught that dinosaurs were real and you never have challenged that belief. I know this because if you challenge that belief, you will not conclude that dinosaurs are real. You will conclude that dinosaurs are only a theory.</p>

<p>The long recorded history of Dragons has been swapped out by the theory of dinosaurs. When did this happen? Well it all started in recent history, 1842 to be exact. Before 1842 everyone referred to these fossilized bones as dragon bones. Did you even know that? One man named Sir Richard Owen created the term dinosaur in 1842. Dinosaur simply means terrible lizard. Understand, no one, in all of world history, believed there were dinosaurs before 1842. Everyone believed in the historical evidence of dragons. That&#39;s because almost every single cultural around the world has historical evidence of dragons. You can check out this article from BBC. Sir Richard Owen: The man who invented the dinosaur.</p>

<p>Is it interesting that after this term was created, all of a sudden the first dinosaur discovery happens in 1858. Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences member, William Foulke excavated the first so-called dinosaur. It was a nearly-complete skeleton, only missing its head. A little fact that indicates that man killed this animal. Only men, when killing an animal, take only the head. The skeleton resembles many early drawings of dragons interestingly enough. But, to make the skeleton look bigger when it was on tour, William Foulke stood it up on its hind legs in a T-Rex position. If this skeleton had been found just 17 years earlier, before 1842, it would have been concluded that they were dragon bones. What a difference just a few years can make.
Sir Richard Owen, who created the term dinosaur, was an evolutionist. Many in the science community at this time we&#39;re trying to disprove what the Bible taught. They wanted to prove Evolution to be true. They found out that many in the scientific community embraced the same goal. Besides, it was a good way to make money. Think of the billions of dollars the dinosaur industry generates today.</p>

<p>History before 1842 clearly states that dragons existed. One culture still today laughs at Western scientists when they Proclaim these bones are dinosaur bones. That culture is China. Many scientists in China TODAY believe that these fossilized bones are dragon bones. China also has the largest recorded history of dragons. Our scientists want us to believe that the recorded history throughout China is simply fantasy. But did you know the number one place for our scientists to find so-called dinosaur bones is in China. That is because More Dragons lived in China and India than anywhere else. So it makes sense that this would be the #1 place to find Dino bones.</p>

<p>The Chinese believe that dragon bones have a medical healing use, and actually consume dragon bone powders. Our scientists have proclaimed that those bones are prehistorical and cannot be used as medicine. There is an actual conflict going on between our two cultures. Read this article from the Associated Press back in 2007. Chinese Eat Dinosaur Bones As Medicine Many of you are still laughing at this article. That&#39;s probably because you don&#39;t even know what a fossil is. So what exactly is a fossil? It is bone that is turned into rock. There&#39;s actually no possible way to determine the difference between a regular Rock and a fossilized bone. If you were to test a dinosaur bone, it would just be the same as a rock. Fascinating how so many dinosaur bones are found in actual rock bed. How can anyone prove that these scientists didn&#39;t just carve out a bone shape from the rocks?
Don&#39;t you find it fascinating that when these scientists go out looking for dinosaur bones they usually find them. They have to, or else they won&#39;t continue to get funding if they keep coming up empty-handed every time. How come nobody accidentally comes across dinosaur bones when digging in their backyard? If you think you found one, they will quickly tell you that it&#39;s not. But they stumble on them all the time when they decide to look for them. I challenge you to go out and find some dinosaur bones. You will fail, but they will always succeed. Well, that because they are experts and you are not, don&#39;t you know.
Did you know that the skeletons in museums are almost always fake. They will even admit to this fact. They will tell you that it&#39;s a replica. They will tell you not to worry, the real bones are hidden away where nobody can actually see them. Why can&#39;t they just display the bones that they find? It&#39;s not because they&#39;re too rare, they could just put them behind glass casing. It&#39;s because, if they use the real fossilized bones, they will hardly have any skeleton to show you. They make up most of the dinosaurs through artistic design. But don&#39;t worry folks, even though you cannot see, feel, touch, or examine any of these bones, just trust them. Isn&#39;t that what you&#39;ve been taught to do? Here&#39;s what&#39;s really interesting. I can make the case that any dinosaur fossils that they find are simply dragon bones. There are many historical accounts describing different types of dragons. Some have the long necks with the fat body, some are snake like. Some have wings and some do not. European culture documents dragons as fact. Ancient Chinese culture documents dragons as fact. The Bible documents dragons as fact.</p>

<p>So what happened to the dragons? They simply went extinct like many other species have. We even know the reason why they went extinct. Historical records show that dragons like to live in caves. They also show that dragons like to eat sheep. Dragons Were a threat to many farmers and their livestock. You have heard of the term Dragon Hunter haven&#39;t you? That&#39;s because they were actual dragon Hunters in history. Farmers in a town would have a dragon problem, where a Dragon was attacking their livestock, they would pay someone to slay the Dragon. This depleted the numbers of dragons and they eventually went extinct. Wolves almost went extinct in America for the same reason.</p>

<p>There is historical records that Dragons were real, but only theories about Dinosaurs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If dragons were real, as you stated, then why would they lie about it? Why would they theorize that those bones are from dinosaurs?</p>

<p>You say the existence of dinosaurs is a myth and a theory. This is not true, because it is seen as a fact. Dragons on the other hand are a myth. You are stating dragons were mentioned in the Bible. I&#39;ve read the bible a couple of times, but never read anything about a dragon.</p>

<p>why would they lie about it?</p>

<p>excluding the dragon possibility, one reason could be that there is a fundamental truth about the design of this &quot;environment&quot;  that they thought they could hide if they constructed a believable enough back story.  rewrite history and do it so elaborately you could indoctrinate everybody to the point society essentially becomes an amnesiac being retrained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To discredit the idea of a God who intelligently designed us humans along with everything else. It&#39;s a big part of the evolution psyop, people are less likely to believe in a benevolent creator who cares about us when you&#39;re indoctrinated with the idea that we won the genetic lottery. Evolution psyop also makes you think less of yourself, regard yourself as part of the animal/beast world, and therefore act on every impulse without further consideration to harm/bad karma.</p>

<p>And yes I get what you are saying, but when someone calls something a psyop, I picture Charles Darwin with his Santa beard and 19 century clothing, sitting around a big table and whiteboard in the Pentagon hatching this plan to conduct psychological warfare on the world to subvert from the actual truth that 20000 years ago there was this guy called Adam and through magic his rib turned into a woman and then a magical talking snake made then eat and apple that they weren&#39;t sposed to.</p>

<p>I also laugh at people who take flat earth seriously, doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t question a lot of things.</p>

<p>Isa_27:1  In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.</p>

<p>The &quot;Day of the Lord&quot; hasn&#39;t happend yet.  It&#39;s when Jesus Christ comes back blood soaked.</p>

<p>Rev_12:9  And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</p>

<p>That&#39;s when he gets kicked out of the 2nd heaven by Michael and his angels and ends up on the earth.</p>

<p>More about Satan/Leviathan/the Dragon and where he is.</p>

<p>Job 41:1  Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? 
Job 41:2  Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 
Job 41:3  Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee? 
Job 41:4  Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? 
Job 41:5  Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 
Job 41:6  Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? 
Job 41:7  Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? 
Job 41:8  Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. 
Job 41:9  Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? 
Job 41:10  None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me? 
Job 41:11  Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. 
Job 41:12  I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. 
Job 41:13  Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? 
Job 41:14  Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. 
Job 41:15  His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. 
Job 41:16  One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. 
Job 41:17  They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. 
Job 41:18  By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 
Job 41:19  Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. 
Job 41:20  Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. 
Job 41:21  His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. 
Job 41:22  In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. 
Job 41:23  The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. 
Job 41:24  His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. 
Job 41:25  When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. 
Job 41:26  The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. 
Job 41:27  He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. 
Job 41:28  The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. 
Job 41:29  Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. 
Job 41:30  Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. 
Job 41:31  He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. 
Job 41:32  He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. 
Job 41:33  Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. 
Job 41:34  He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride. </p>

<p>The same reason they lie about evidence of Gaints.</p>

<p>The same reason they lie about &quot;outer space.&quot;</p>

<p>The same reason they lie about the shape and motion of the earth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all an attempt to discredit the Bible to make it look like a book of fiction instead of the book of facts from God that it is.  This in turn allows Lucifer to drag eternal souls to the lake of fire with him since they deny the blood atonement made for them by Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>It doesn’t answer my practical question. What’s the difference, to you, between dragons and dinosaurs besides a name change that made some darwinians feel more comfortable. Do you believe they breathed fire? That’s about the only difference of which I’m aware. </p>

<p>What is biblical about dragons in you opinion. Also is there a specific reason there knowledge is being suppressed outside of trying to keep down biblical beliefs?</p>

I meant that the makeup of a dragon is simply a flying reptile (perhaps with the typical physical facial features and such that make them look typically like our society’s idea of a “dragon”) and so the possibility of their existence isn’t far-fetched (which is what you’re always saying).

    <div class="md"><p>Except that thinking that mythological creatures are real is ludicrous. </p>

<p>The OP is talking about how before a certain point dinosaurs were called dragons. This was probably due to dinosaur bones being found and people using their imagination to create the mythology about dragons. </p>

<p>But as scientific knowledge advanced, people moved on and the only mention of dragons is in fiction and as a historical reference. </p>

<p>You might as well argue that the earth is flat or that the earth is the centre of the universe, because that&#39;s what people used to believe. </p>

<p>All the holes in logic are on your side, and again, you have not refuted a single thing I said or pointed out a single hope in my logic, despite repeatedly claiming this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The flaws are views such as “dragons are fantasy creatures in myths, so their existence is implausible”. It’s not about hard complex evidence, other wise it would not be “discussing the <em>possibility</em>” like I just said I was and what this whole Reddit thread is about, it would be a historical argument. It’s about simplistic reasoning instead. I’m just pointing out any flaws because they just happen to be there and therefore close off any other thought towards the subject matter if not simply comprehended as existing, not because I care about “concluding that dragons existed”. </p>

<p>Once again, answer my question for the sake of discussion, not argument. I’m simply curious to delve deeper into the foundations of your viewpoint. You also admitted that there were flying dinosaurs, which would have almost identical makeup to a dragon. </p>

Hell, the very idea that <em>anything exists at all</em> is just a theory. And yet no-one in their right minds would object to those facts, because a theory is not what you think it is. A theory is not plausible-sounding but baseless conjecture--that we call a hypothesis--but a well-founded prediction, that has been extensively subjected to empirical testing and found to have held up every time. That&#39;s not to say that theories are infallible, of course, but that you did not even bother to familiarise yourself with the most basic aspects of scientific practice before dismissing it all tells me all I need to know about how seriously one should take your opinion.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not aware of any, but I&#39;m not discounting the possibility; palaeontology is just a hobby of mine (my primary fields of physics) and I am thus only familiar with the most well-known sites.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And was it chalked up to shifting tectonic plates moving the earth above them, or something like that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me just ask you this. If the vast majority of dinosaur and human fossils have vast layers of separation between them, but a small minority does not, what is more likely: that a tiny population of dinosaurs somehow lasted tens of millions of years without leaving any fossil trace whatsoever only to pop up again in the recent past, or that some geologic event caused two formerly separate layers to merge into one? This is a very good example of why one must always review evidence within its scientific context instead of separately.</p>

<p>If you were to test a dinosaur bone, it would just be the same as a rock. Fascinating how so many dinosaur bones are found in actual rock bed. How can anyone prove that these scientists didn&#39;t just carve out a bone shape from the rocks?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>X-ray spectroscopy can be used to identify chemical differences between a fossil and the surrounding rock. So if these fossils are just carved by scientists, they must have carved them from two different materials and seamlessly pieced them together. Seems like a lot of work just in case someone points an X-ray fluorimeter at your fake fossil at some point in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not ready to accept this theory yet.  I need more evidence.</p>

<p>However, it is undeniable that almost every culture in the world had dragons.  Those stories had to have come from somewhere.</p>

<p>What we need to do is divorce from our minds the very modern archetype of dragon.<br/>
The flying, fire breathing, Smaug, D&amp;D thing.</p>

<p>Most European stories of dragons described something much smaller.  Able to be killed from horseback with a spear aimed downwards.</p>

<p>If it had wings (which most didn&#39;t) they were almost vestigial.  Batlike wings were a common symbol in art to show that something was evil.  </p>

<p>Now, if we speculate a little bit more, what if the fire breathing was a metaphor for how much their bite hurt.  What if that bite hurt so much because they were venomous?</p>

<p>Like the Komodo Dragon.  Or, the Megalania.  </p>

<p>The Leviathan story is interesting because if you read it with an open mind you will come to the conclusion that it was none other than Godzilla, himself.  It describes how unkillable it was.  There has never been an animal in the history of human kind that we couldn&#39;t find a way to kill.  </p>

<p>So, it&#39;s either out there in the ocean, dreaming, or that story could be the template for modern dragon myths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took you seriously until &quot;You&#39;ve heard the term Dragon Hunter haven&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;ve heard the term vampire hunter, haven&#39;t you?  That&#39;s because there were actual Vampire hunters in history.  People in town would have a vampire problem, where a vampire was drinking people&#39;s blood and converting them to vampirism and they would pay someone to slay the vampire.  This depleted the number of Vampires and they essentially went extinct.  Intelligence and an ability to asses evidence on it&#39;s relative merits almost went extinct for the same reason.</p>

<p>Oh one more thing, a fossil is not just a rock  It&#39;s internal structure will be very different from that of a rock in most cases, indicating biological structure.  And you don&#39;t find them in back gardens very much they tend to only appear where certain geological preconditions are met.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve looked at all the minutiae that would support you preposterous theory and then ignored everything that would disprove it.</p>

<p>According to what source? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>wasnt born on the 25th of December</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Real Christians know this and it’s not even biblical... The Romans merged their pagan rites with Christian beliefs in an effort to stem the growing tide of converts and muddy the waters. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>his name wasn’t even Jesus</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also know this. It’s believed his given name was Yeshua Ben-Yosef. Jesus Christ is greek for “The anointed one.” Still an appropriate title if you ask me. </p>

<p>Not sure why you’re so hard up against Jesus. Probably got some mighty powerful demons living in your belly. Prayers for your peace and reconciliation friend. The truth is the light and it will destroy all darkness. </p>

<p>I think defaulting to this stance because &quot;it&#39;s like, just a theory, man, and the Chinese say they&#39;re dragons...&quot; is sort of like saying &quot;well, we used to explain space differently, and there&#39;s really zero evidence (that I&#39;m willing to look at or make an attempt to understand in the context of the past two hundred years of scientific knowledge generation and accumulation) to discredit the existence of the aether, so...&quot;</p>

<p>p.s. there are &quot;historical records&quot; about a god beating off into his own mouth and spitting the world out after swishing it around a bit - maybe history is something that&#39;s as accurate as the people writing it, and it&#39;s revised as more and better information comes to light</p>
