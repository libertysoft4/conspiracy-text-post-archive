<p>What makes you think you know anything more than her? Because of your preconceived ideas of who she is?</p>

<p>Have you gone into the slums of LA to talk to actual homeless people about how they ended up homeless, what impacts their criminal history has had their lives, and how they&#39;re struggling to get back on their feet due to minor convictions years ago?</p>

<p>Kim has. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. But &quot;Trump meets with policy makers to talk about prison sentences&quot; does not make as many headlines as &quot;Trump meets with Kim K.&quot; </p>

<p>Kim isnt writing policy. Publicity and the public push for policies to be made by professionals (unfortunately they&#39;re fighting a bigger lobby funded by private prisons and led by fuckface Jeff Sessions).</p>

<p>During a emotional divorce his wife claimed he karate kicked her in the head. That&#39;s pretty crazy.</p>

<p>He is a conservative speaker, writer, and film makers. I guess that is why you call him a liar.</p>

<p>He was on probation for going over the allowed campaign contribution by about $5000 and accused of trying to set up strawman contribution to get $20k through.Which he claimed innocence.  All by the Obama admin who he criticized heavily.  </p>

<p>No, he pled guilty and stated that he knew he was breaking the law.</p>

<p>During the plea proceeding, D’SOUZA admitted before the Court that he caused two close associates to contribute $10,000 each to the Long Campaign with the understanding that he would reimburse them for their contributions and that he did reimburse them. D’SOUZA also admitted that he knew that what he was doing was wrong and something the law forbids.</p>

<p>Looks like he&#39;s said/done some other pretty shitty/shady things to me. Also a bit of a hypocrite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Abu Ghraib scandal, for example, was actually the fault of liberals because the soldiers who enacted the despicable acts, Lynddie England and Charles Graner, were divorced, sex-crazed partiers who were therefore “act[ing] out the fantasies of blue America.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty rich coming from the man who got engaged and was allegedly sleeping with another woman while both were still married.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On May 20, 2014, the day the trial was to begin, D’Souza pleaded guilty to the illegal campaign contribution charge (taking the second charge off the table) and professed to take responsibility for his actions. The next few months would be critical, as the judge would be deliberating on the appropriate sentence. The moment called for humility. D’Souza enlisted 27 people—colleagues, friends, and family members in India—to write to the judge on his behalf. While they got busy attesting to his remorse, he began publicly conveying just the opposite. Brafman begged his client to keep his mouth shut, but D’Souza couldn’t resist.</p>
