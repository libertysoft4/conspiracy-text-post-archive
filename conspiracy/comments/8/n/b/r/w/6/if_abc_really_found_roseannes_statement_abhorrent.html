<p>Paula Dean got railroaded and I was glad she got a chance to attempt to rehabilitate her public persona but judging by how people including the OP is willing to accuse Paula of going on Twitter and being a raging racist she will never make a comeback.  It&#39;s sad how the racist tag once applied can affect your life forever.  She went from having one of the most popular cooking shows to doing a web series.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Deen#Food_Network_and_other_television">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Deen#Food_Network_and_other_television</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On June 21, 2013, due to a controversy regarding Deen&#39;s admission, during a deposition for a lawsuit, that she had used racial slurs in a social media post, The Food Network announced they will not renew her contract.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The detailed section at the bottom doesn&#39;t mention anything about social media. I also never said Twitter - read it again. I was assuming from that quote that it was semi-private FB posts or something. I&#39;ve seen people get casual on those. Please also quote for me the part where I said &quot;raging racist&quot;. It&#39;s like everyone&#39;s playing a game of telephone between their eyes (or ears) and their brain where all kinds of exaggerations are made.</p>

<p>Read her deposition. She tries to dance and brings up this ridiculous story about using it in reference to a black bank robber. But then she admits to using it at other times but is very vague about it and won&#39;t really give specifics. Is she a hardcore racist? Like a died in the wool Hulk Hogan, thought it out and genuinely believe in lesser races racist? I really don&#39;t think so. I just think it would catch up to you eventually.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t you right this sentence?  You are using IF to build a conditional statement to compare past to Future.  Comrade if your goal is express a hypothetical past compared to a possible future  you have to say WHAT IF.  </p>

<p>In communication their is a burden on the speaker to convey their ideas.  If you are misunderstood because you assumed the reader would infer the hypothetical nature of your statement when you didn&#39;t express the statement was hypothetical in the first place then that is your mistake.</p>

Knowing that broadcast tv and cable are on the down slide for years, she would be able to start something else on a streaming platform and be able to have full creative freedom without filling Disney&#39;s pockets anymore.</p>
