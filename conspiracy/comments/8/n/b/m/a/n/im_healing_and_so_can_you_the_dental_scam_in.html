        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Modern Dentistry is a scam.</p>

<p>yes, it is almost a needed service, how ever, the products used are completly harmful to the body.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good to get regular dental cleanings (every 3 months) but in all honesty if you follow a few simple tricks below your mouth and gums will start healing (i promise)</p>

<p>now because of the medical cartel in america, this kind of natural information is naturally suppressed by these money hungry power hungry corporations that only care about squeezing money off us from insurance.</p>

<p>let me first start by saying</p>

<p>ALL DENTAL FILLINGS FOR CAVITIES ARE TOXIC</p>

<p>Even the caps (plastic which is then &quot;sealed&quot;) silver amalgram (metals mixed together in a slurry including mercury) </p>

<p>the only true metals that wont hurt you are silver and gold (its a reason why they are precious)</p>

<p>no one has $2,000 per tooth for a pure gold filling however.</p>

<p>so lets talk natural remedies.</p>

<p>first off, ditch the older electric sonicare tooth brushes, they harbor mold like a mofo (unless you regulary take it apart and clean it)</p>

<p>let me explain some basics to you</p>

<p>bacteria exists. both good and bad. your mouth has many types of bacteria within it (tons, because its your mouth)</p>

<p>when you eat a starchy, sugary, toxic diet, you will be fueling these bad bacteria that thrive on an acidic and unbalanced PH mouth.</p>

<p>heres what you can do</p>

<ul>
<li><p>extra virgin coconut oil for mouth oil pulls. this draws the bacteria out of your gums and also dissolves the plaque at your gum line so you can break through the bio film of the bactera colonies within your gums</p></li>
<li><p>alkalize your mouth!! pay the damn money and get a good small bottle of alkalizing mouth wash . this will allow your mouth to reach a natural PH balance. I use Uncle harrys natural products, its called miracle mouth wash and even has silver in it. you can swallow remnants no problem and it doesnt have the neuro toxin of fluoride. this stuff will burn your mouth but its the good burn of alkaizing an acidic mouth thus bringing healing potential</p></li>
<li><p>activated charcoal tooth paste. we dont need to brush twice a day but it helps. i use activated charcoal tooth paste which allows it to cut through the plaque. you wanna go in small circles all across the bottom of your teeth while hitting/massaging the gums</p></li>
<li><p>massaging the gums with your tooth brush allows the gums to release and let surface the toxins within the gum line.</p></li>
<li><p>floss. this is a no brainer but helps prevent plaque build up (which should not really be an issue anyway if you use the virgin coconut oil to do mouth pulls)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>most of this stuff can be bought online! uncleharrys.com has good stuff too. Also, avoid fluoride, avoid that stuff like the plague.</p>

<p>It will bio-accumulate within the pineal gland and calicify your natural connection to divine source itself.</p>

<p>Lastly. Quit eating bull shit toxic foods. Most of the US food supply is loaded with bull shit. Less ingredeints the better. Avoid artifical colors, flavors, weird sounding chemical names, K.I.S.S.</p>

<p>You will notice your mouth start to heal.</p>

<p>Guess what guys. I was told my gum receeding was &quot;probably genetic&quot;</p>

<p>Guess who has new healthy gum tissue growing back on my lower teeth and my mouth feels far better.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t listen to fear and baseless advice rooted in fear just because a medical cartel is too busy sucking you of money. Take your power. Own your power. And heal your body on your own.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need to put ourselves into debt just to heal or get costly procedures. Our immune system works so well and we act like we always need outside help when we are our own saviours.</p>

<p>Unplug from the criminal medical cartel and take your health into your own hands!!!</p>

<ul>
<li>Look into Natural Iosol Iodine </li>
<li>Look into castor oil</li>
<li>Look into collodial silver</li>
<li>Homeopathic medicines works (little spendy but worth it!)</li>
<li>the more natural the better. Mother Gaia provides us with every healing remedy we need</li>
</ul>

<p>I can provide additional tips if you need it. List your medical concerns and lets heal each other naturally and easy using 10$-100$ supplies instead of thousands in medical debt just to &quot;target symptoms&quot;</p>

<p>Target the root cause and YOU WILL HEAL</p>

<p>We are divine powerful temples of light housing a consciousness of divine source. Tap into your healing and release the toxins and invaders within your body. This is your right. Take it.</p>

<p>Much love and light to all of you</p>

<p>God Bless</p>

<p>Us</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also Sea salt rinses and brushing with sea salt water does wonders to teeth and gums. All my issues went away and its been almost 2 years and the dentist said I&#39;m good and dont need cleanings (at the very least I found an honest dentist who is also pro DIY alternative options)</p>

<p>There are scam dentists out there who will lie and do shit to you that you dont need just to get the money</p>

<p>I use pink himalayan salt but other celtic and Utah Redmond salt are also excellent options.</p>

<p>What I do is mix in the sea salt, activated charcoal, and I have some mineral drops (liquid bottle of essential minerals) I throw into a jar mixed with coconut oil, spearmint oil, and a bit of baking soda for the alkalinity and wash twice a day</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t know google was conducting studies about the toxicity of tooth fillings, could you satisfy my curiosity and send me a link?</p>

<p>Also, your personal anecdote is a strong confirmation bias for your beliefs. It doesn&#39;t mean that confirmation bias == false premise, but i would use that anecdote as a justification to seek evidence, not as evidence itself, if i were you. But i suppose you already <em>did</em> your homework and found a respectable study supporting your claims?</p>

<p>Keep in mind that i am a skeptic, however, so if you seek to convince non-skeptics to trust your findings, you should stop wasting time with me, as i have stated to be a skeptic. </p>

<p>Please, teach me how i can convince you to provide me with a source for your initial claim. We both know it&#39;s as easy as 2 clicks, and i believe we both work for the same cause, which is to break the conspiracy paradigm and unleash the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on both sides of this argument because I try to find balance between ideas like the body being able to heal itself and finding documentable evidence for claims. </p>

<p>The problem we have now is when people rely too heavily on &quot;scientific&quot; studies that are either untrue, funded by corporations with a specific agenda, or are only there to confirm/deny an existing idea with little to no basis in fact or reality.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is, <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/editor-in-chief-of-worlds-best-known-medical-journal-half-of-all-the-literature-is-false/5451305">a huge number of peer-reviewed journals</a> are flat out false. These are coming from the world&#39;s top credible schools/journals and yet people look towards them as gospel. </p>

<p>We have a <strong><em>huge</em></strong> global problem of looking towards &quot;science&quot; as gospel (almost no different than religious folk look towards their respective authority). We&#39;re now living in a global society dominated by &quot;scientism&quot; and it&#39;s causing more harm then good because now you have so many individuals who cry, &quot;where&#39;s the proof?!&quot; and seek out documented evidence of their position. </p>

<p>This is a dangerous, slippery slope we&#39;re on and it needs to be corrected. So in the meantime, it&#39;s honestly best to do your own research, conduct your own experiments if possible, and check out as many sources for claims as possible; regardless of where that information is obtained - be it a random conspiracy website or scientific journal. </p>

<p>Please understand that I&#39;m not discrediting the <em>scientific method</em> at all. It&#39;s still valid, alive, and well. What I&#39;m questioning is taking scientific institutions and their claim of authority over science as fact/gospel and not seeking out any alternatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are both on the same page. There is a clear distinction between &quot;X may be a fact&quot; and &quot;X <em>is</em> a fact&quot;. If you make a claim, have the decency to back it, otherwise literally just reformulate your claim as to not imply it is absolute.</p>

<p>Of course there are always two sides of the same medal; those who blindly believe any source, as long as it is written by someone with a piece of paper proving they have <em>some</em> knowledge, not necessarily in the subject of their paper (this is what we both define as &quot;scientism&quot;) and those who fall into the trap of believing any source is bad, and who fully support preachers who have no source, simply <em>because</em> they have no source.</p>

<p>Both of these subgroups have the problem of not using critical thinking, which is a learnable skill, not some kind of &quot;intelligence treshold&quot;.</p>

<p>Is that your comment? Because it sounds a lot like astroturfing.</p>

<p>To answer your initial question, being a skeptic is not a bad thing (I&#39;m one too). But usually when someone throws around their skeptic badge so mightily, it&#39;s because they are pretending. Just like you&#39;re pretending right now. You&#39;re pretending like you don&#39;t know how to search Google for something the OP has pointed out. Instead, you sit here fishing for sources from the OP, so that you can attack whatever source he comes back with, and if you can&#39;t attack the source you will find a way to attack the author or cry about how the journal is pay to play or complain about P-values or whatever it is. Meanwhile, OP is finding a better way to live his life, and sharing his findings. Maybe you should do the same.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done my own research and concluded that fillings are safe based on your post.</p>

<p>You say fillings are not safe.</p>

<p>You read my simple question, then put something in quotes that, not only did I never say, I never remotely implied, in fact you don&#39;t even say what &quot;the narrative&quot; is supposed to be.</p>

<p>So you either can&#39;t read or just make stuff up.</p>

<p>So if you say something is not safe it&#39;s should be safe to assume that it is.</p>

You can&#39;t use people who have an extreme bias and an entire industry to protect as a valid source. No amount of mercury in the body is safe. Not to mention the fact that c. albicans fungus(which causes oral thrush and is very common in the oral cavity) methylates metal mercury into methyl mercury which is hundreds of times more toxic. Saccharomyces cerevisiae(brewers yeast) also methylates elemental mercury, so anytime someone drinks beer with fillings they are exposed to extremely toxic methyl mercury. </p>

Not all yeast. As far as I know just two species of fungus/yeast are known to do this. Having oral thrush and amalgam fillings would be incredibly bad for somebody but I suppose it is not directly the fillings fault for that.

Nature is a force and it couldn&#39;t give less of a fuck whether we&#39;re healthy or dying. Your natural remedies argument is bullshit, do you know where we get pharmaceuticals from?

<p>I would say it took about 6 uses before I got used to this toothpaste. Let me tell you - no one will regret this switch. Providing the right environment for your mouth allows you mouth to heal. Yes heal. Have a cavity? Providing the right environment will allow your teeth to regenerate, naturally. Sounds outlandish but I can say I will never go back. </p>

I&#39;m sure there are dentists in places like Colorado, and California that practice these methods. In all honesty it comes down to the state you live in and your client base.

<p>you get into trouble when the rot hits the nerve within the tooth</p>

<p>if the tooth is really really painful then it may be a loss</p>

<p>but you can reverse things and prevent further decay by keeping a balanced ph in the mouth</p>

<p>oral probitiocs may help as well</p>

<p>but iltimately, keep the mouth clean and watch acidic candies and sodas, or at least brush at night etc so it isnt sitting there </p>

<p>its good to make sure its extra virgin coconut oil because most coconut oil isnt even made from coconuts</p>

<p>Their biggest sponsors are Colgate and Invisalign, so damn straight you need their products. Dentists have an average of a half million dollars in debt before they even get their own practice, so they need to sell a fuck ton of tooth paste and braces to pay that off. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Four researchers in their study involving 60 adolescents of age 16–18 years with plaque induced gingivitis, observed statistically significant reduction of plaque and gingival indices upon oil pulling using coconut oil. Subjects performed oil pulling in early morning at empty stomach in addition to their routine oral hygiene measures such as brushing and flossing. They were assessed after 4 h after performing oil pulling. Modified Gingival Index and plaque index by Sillness and Loe were measured at baseline and on days 1, 7, 15 and 30. Steady decline in indices was found from day seven. Plaque and gingival indices significantly decreased after 30 days of oil pulling. The study observed 50% decreases in gingival and plaque indices after four weeks which is comparatively similar to results produced by chlorhexidine. They concluded that oil pulling with coconut oil is helpful in decreasing plaque formation and plaque induced gingivitis.</p>

<p>I think tomorrow I may do a healing thread and if anyone needs advice on simple healing stuff i can help out.</p>

<p>Dont know if youve heard of Edgar Cayce but I have a huge healing dictionary i bought that has a ton of natural remedies that will help heal the root and not the symptom.</p>

<p>Secondly, wrt activated charcoal toothpaste, have you noticed any damage to your teeth or enamel? I got it into my head to use charcoal and used it for about a week before I freaked myself out by searching for whether it would damage my teeth or not. I couldn’t find a consensus, but most people seem to think you should only use it 2x per week or so. </p>

<p>I didn’t notice anything out of ordinary in the couple weeks I used it. I was just experimenting to see if it would have an effect on my pineal gland or intuition but admittedly didn’t try anything else you mentioned. </p>

<p>activated charcoal seems to be the ideal choice but its your call, and yeah you dont have to brush that often especially if you eat a clean diet. at the least ill swish with the magic mouth wash and do an oil pull</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Sorry for long comment) Im kinda of confused here guys. I was on board with it being a scam because it does cost crazy amounts. But when medical supplies in the us are so expensive and dental school alone costs $350,000-$400,000 what do you expect? I took this as fillings are toxic (which I’m not sure if it is or isn’t , but certainly the whole industry isn’t trying to kill us) then a great list of how to have great dental hygiene. Was this post saying go to natural remedies to have great hygiene, or using natural remedies to fix all dental problems? Because if you have had terrible dental hygiene racking up medical issues, you can’t just use natural remedies to fix most of the problems. You WILL need medical attention. As for ops gums, it is great op took it upon him/herself to fix it and have great results! But I don’t see the scam with dentists there. The point of having great hygiene beforehand as op described is so you don’t have to use the dentist for anything other than a check up in the first place. I don’t see the conspiracy so please correct me on what I’m missing. I think this is a great post, and reminder, for taking better care of your mouth, I will be checking out the products op talked about! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just realized this post is not a conspiracy towards dental being a scam or fillings being bad for you. But this is a conspiracy that and dentists are soul sucking voodoo doctors and fillings are their tool. I feel stupid for caring, but for real guys! Just listen to the taking good care of your mouth part and get your past dental problems fixed BY A DENTIST. It improves quality of life and the sooner you fix it the less it will cost. And who knows, if this post is right about taking good care of your mouth you will not only avoid dental bills but also gain your inner light temple or whatever.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, this guy is telling people to not use the dentist and “heal” your problems that wont fix themselves like a cavity that needs a filling (yes he says that in the comments). He also says the dentists are using toxic things to destroy our being of light or whatever. I hope no one takes this seriously, but i saw a guy asking op for advice with his unfilled cavities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a broken tooth and putting off going to the dentist. I woke up one morning in pain, my gums and cheek swelled up so I called the dentist to get in for an emergency visit but was informed he was on vacation for another week. I remembered colloidal silver was anti-bacterial, viral, etc. so I started rinsing with it every couple hours and took probably twice the suggested amount. The pain went away within a few a hours and the swelling went down in a few days. I put off going to the dentist and haven&#39;t had any reoccurring issues in the last year. The weird thing besides the silver working so fast is that my gums grew into the broken side of my tooth. I&#39;m not saying this is a permanent fix by any means but now I&#39;m curious to see how long it will last before I have problems again. I&#39;m living proof that the colloidal silver will clear up some nasty infections.</p>

<p>may I ask why you feel the need to start things?</p>

<p>may I ask why you feel the need to not critically think about any of this whatsoever?</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny that you did not respond to my other comment, regarding blaming others for your own problems.</p>

<p>First off, read this</p>

<p><a href="https://www.alternet.org/personal-health/when-its-time-fill-your-cavities-all-options-are-toxic">https://www.alternet.org/personal-health/when-its-time-fill-your-cavities-all-options-are-toxic</a></p>

<p>Second, since I doubt you read my other link and only care about starting shit with people, this is for you:</p>

<p>&quot;When we understand how fear is created in the body, it is helpful in releasing the grip of anxiety and fear patterns. People that are triggered into fears and mental anxiety may impulsively turn to blame shifting or the projection of their fears onto others. When people are in deep pain and they are suffering, many times they will move unacceptable impulses in themselves and place them onto someone else&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://eraoflight.com/2018/05/31/denial-and-blame-shifters/#more-68935">https://eraoflight.com/2018/05/31/denial-and-blame-shifters/#more-68935</a></p>

<p>Third, all you do is attack others while provide 0 substance. I&#39;m convinced you&#39;re not here to foster discussion but instead create disharmony. </p>

<p>Read those 2 links then get back to me with an actual discussion. Until then, I know what your motives are and I can see right through them :)</p>

<p>Ok, you provided one source....what about all the other claims you&#39;re making? Got anything to back up any of those homeopathic remedies? Or how about the thousands of dollars in debt figure? I just got 7 fillings and a cleaning: my total cost was &lt;$100</p>

<p>And lastly, you can call me a denier all you want, but if you go back and reread...I didn&#39;t deny any of your claims until about the 4th time I asked for sources and you wouldn&#39;t provide any</p>

<p>here you seem to convienatly ignore all my other comments so here, this is for you troll</p>

<p>When your dentist finds a cavity, besides the immediate fear of the drill or the painful pinch of the novocaine injection, the choice of filling material can also raise anxieties. And it&#39;s not easy—you either opt for plastic composite resins, which use dangerous plasticizers like bisphenol A, or metal amalgam fillings containing mercury, which needs little introduction as a toxic heavy metal. Both types of fillings bring with them concerns about long-term health effects and both show risks and benefits in terms of their durability and other factors affecting long-term oral health</p>
