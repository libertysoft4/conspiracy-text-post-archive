<hr/>

<p>let me tell you the &#39;evidence&#39; that originally convinced me that man has walked on the moon...</p>

<p>in 7th grade science there were about 2 pages in a textbook consisting of a few photographs and some text. we blew threw those pages and the teacher didn&#39;t allow us any time to ask questions and didn&#39;t give us any homework related to the moon landings, and that was it. it was never brought up again</p>

<p>so in the 7th grade, <em>that</em> was what originally convinced me that men had walked on the moon</p>

<p><em>that</em> was what i accepted as evidence </p>

<p>now my question for you all is, how flimsy was the &#39;evidence&#39; that you accepted?</p>

<p>i bet most people are too ashamed to present the evidence that originally convinced them, because when they go to fetch it, they suddenly realize how bogus their evidence looks and feels </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure most people who were too young to &quot;witness&quot; the landing back in the 69 have a very similar story. It was just something that was told to us as young children and further drilled into our heads via news and entertainment media.       </p>

<p>I just sort of always took it as a given because everyone believed it....or at least said they believed it. Not until i actually considered the possibility that it was a lie and looked into the &quot;evidence&quot; for myself was I able to see the deception...and it took some time. 30+ years of indoctrination doesn&#39;t just disappear in an instant, no matter how much evidence you have to prove it was a lie.</p>

<p>truth! as mark twain allegedly observed, its easier to fool someone than it is to convince someone that they have been fooled </p>

<p>it didn&#39;t take much to convince me that men had walked on the moon, but it took quite a bit to convince me to change my mind</p>

<p>this phenomenon can be observed in other areas, such as with vaccine zealots  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>more truth! </p>

<p>a friend once related to me the story of how he and another friend had gotten into an argument about a particular bible verse, and whether it ended in &quot;for ever&quot; or &quot;for ever and ever&quot;. </p>

<p>they finally got the bible out and read the exact same verse from the exact same bible at the exact same time... and yet they both continued to insist that the bible said what they thought it had said </p>

<p>i experience this kind of Mandela effect (for lack of a better descriptor) almost every day.</p>

<p>after a while, you not only look at the evidence, but you also start to ponder why other people perceive evidence differently </p>

<p>it would be easy to assume that you are always right, and that the other person is wrong, but clearly this can&#39;t always be the case </p>

<p>heres two videos that come to mind when discussing the psychology of evidence </p>

<p>hollow face mask effect</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the hollow face experiment in particular is so helpful in illustrating how your brain will determine what you eye sees, as opposed to your eye determining what your brain will see</p>

<p>did you know that your eyes are actually a part of your brain that is exposed to light?</p>

<p>anyway, no matter how many times you watch that video, and even when your brain knows what it should be seeing, your brain will see what it wants to see anyway. I&#39;ve tried to force myself to see the hollow mask as it really is, and thus far i have not been able to do it</p>

<p>so this effect is true for everyone, which is a lesson and a warning to you... you can&#39;t trust your eyes or your brain, especially after they have been brainwashed to see a certain way </p>

<p>the video isn&#39;t political or religious, and its short. so its quick and easy to share, and to help others to better understand themselves and their own shortcomings and exploitable weaknesses </p>

<p>I had this discussion with this exact OP a couple of days ago. Whenever <em>his</em> worldview was challenged he simply denied the evidence and spouted yet more bullshit.</p>

<p>This is the guy that denies there is such a thing as &quot;escape velocity&quot; and who kept linking to wikipedia&#39;s article about the inverse square law without having the slightest bit of understanding what it meant.</p>

<p>Talking to him is not &quot;having a discussion&quot;, it&#39;s more like beating your head against a wall. The wall is still ignorant and you end up with a headache.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame more people don&#39;t know about this. Priests of Scientism convince the masses that they know what is at the center of the so called globe earth, which by their definition is ~20,903,520 ft from the surface, yet the deepest hole man has dug on record is ~40,230 ft from the surface. Seems legit.        </p>

<p>I just think God simply created an environment for us to live and thrive in and gave it borders. Not so much unlike how we would have an ant farm or aquarium, but large enough that it would take great effort to reach said borders, and if/when we got close, it would be extremely dangerous for us. Extreme heat and or water pressure below us, extreme cold at the furthest points from the center of the habitat, and lack of matter/oxygen above us.     </p>

<p>I remember watching a video once about how lab animals behavior would change for the worst once they realized that they were in a &quot;cage&quot; but until it did, it was content and lived symbiotically with its environment. And I remember wondering if something similar happened to mankind during/after the industrial revolution when human technology allowed us to travel and explore the furthest regions of our environment...   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I understand what earthquakes or how they are caused have anything to do with the fact that the scientism establishment claims to know the inner workings and makeup of the globe, yet have only been able to witness a small fraction of depth from the surface.      </p>

<p>And I admit, I know very little about seismic activity. But just because I can&#39;t make a model explaining it, does not mean that their model is correct. And that is even more true if they claim seismic activity has anything to do with a section of their globe that is deeper than what they are able to observe, either by digging or ground penetrating radar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok...if you are referring to ground penetrating radar or similar tech, you are greatly overestimating its capabilities. As I said before. The deepest hole ever dug on record was ~40,230 ft deep, and the center of supposed globe earth is ~20,903,520 ft deep. If you think that ground penetrating radar and or similar tech can give us a picture of the earth at anywhere near 20 million feet deep, even if it was used at the bottom of said deepest hole, you are fooling yourself.       </p>

<p>yes its a bit curious that the coloring of the flag is so off, which is why i made a sepia version of the same pics, so that people are not confused by the colors being off and are able to focus on the shadows and contour of the flags </p>

<p>even at 2km, its implausible that the beam would hit the intended target at over 200,000 miles away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I get the concept of pointing a laser at the moon. It was done in 1963, before men were said to ever walk there and put the reflectors, which it turns out are not necessary to reflect a laser from the moon.</p>

<p>The point is that you have no way of doing this. No one can explain how they can “aim” the laser at the reflector, but that’s a different story anyway. Anyone using the reflectors as proof of a moon walk is simply relying on a NASA-endorsed planetarium somewhere saying “ok everyone. We did it, it worked.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah supposedly the laser measurement is so accurate, that it can even measure the amount of earth tide underneath the laser, making the measurements even more useless than they already were </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_tide">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_tide</a></p>

<p>but seriously. MIT could measure with a laser in 1961, which means reflectors are not necessary, nor accurate.</p>

<p>furthermore, there is no plausible &#39;national security&#39; reason to need to dominate the moon by putting a US flag and/or reflectors there </p>

<p>during the height of the VietNam War, the establishment did the old &#39;point my finger at the moon, and make everyone look&#39; trick, and everyone fell for it </p>

<p>did measuring the distance to the moon have any significant effect on anything that was going on at the time, or even today in 2018?</p>

<p>please don&#39;t say we learned that the moon is moving away from us, because that was already knowable in 1961</p>

<p>Actually that is how you confirm something....by testing/experiencing something for yourself....and there are a metric shit ton of things that one can easily confirm...      </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t personally been to NZ, and admit that I take it on faith that it actually exists. However, as far as I know, I can buy a ticket for a trip there, jump on a plane or boat and arrive there, just as millions and millions of other people have claimed to do. Can&#39;t exactly say that about mars, the moon or low earth orbit now can we? And its been what? 50 years sine NASA supposedly landed a man on the moon? And they have had billions billions of dollars to work with since then? Are you telling me they had the technology 50 years ago, the money and the manpower and still haven&#39;t turned it into a commercial business yet? In USA ffs? Really? Hell, I even remember back in the day one of those backstreet boys or nsync guys, i forget which, offered NASA millions to let him go up into space and they turned him down. Gimme a break...     </p>

<p>But oh yeah, keep gushing over NASA&#39;s obviously fake footage and interviews with astronNOTS in &quot;space&quot; and keep holding your breath for Elon or Jeff to make that dream, or even a much less ambitious dream of &quot;low earth orbit&quot; commercial flights, a reality...I&#39;m &quot;sure&quot; they will make that a thing....soon™ ;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>“But wait,” you say, “NASA has solid evidence of the validity of the Moon landings. They have, for example, all of that film footage shot on the moon and beamed live directly into our television sets.”</p>

<p>Since we’re on the subject, I have to mention that transmitting live footage back from the Moon was another rather innovative use of 1960s technology. More than two decades later, we would have trouble broadcasting live footage from the deserts of the Middle East, but in 1969, we could beam that shit back from the Moon with nary a technical glitch!</p>

<p>As it turns out, however, NASA doesn’t actually have all of that Moonwalking footage anymore. Truth be told, they don’t have any of it. According to the agency, all the tapes were lost back in the late 1970s. All 700 cartons of them. As Reuters reported on August 15, 2006, “The U.S. government has misplaced the original recording of the first moon landing, including astronaut Neil Armstrong’s famous ‘one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind’ … Armstrong’s famous moonwalk, seen by millions of viewers on July 20, 1969, is among transmissions that NASA has failed to turn up in a year of searching, spokesman Grey Hautaluoma said. ‘We haven’t seen them for quite a while. We’ve been looking for over a year, and they haven’t turned up,’ Hautaluoma said … In all, some 700 boxes of transmissions from the Apollo lunar missions are missing.”   </p>

<p>That was the nail in the coffin for me when I first read about it years ago. Anyone who actually believes these people have my sincere pity.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re a kid you just take these things for granted. You have no concept of conspiracies and like Hitler said, the bigger and bolder the lie is the easier it is to believe.</p>

<p>I had never watched the original footage or interviews with astronauts or anything like this. Most people have not.</p>

<p>If you imagine how things would be on the lunar front now, almost 50 years later, if we had really gone to the moon, vs how they are now, with lost telemetry data and endless excuses and justifications for every bizarre anomaly that is pointed out, it&#39;s pretty obvious things have unfolded exactly how they would have in the wake of a hoax rather than a real moon trip. </p>

<p>But I used to talk about the Van Allen belts and stuff like this when debating the moon missions. Now, I don&#39;t believe anyone can go anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When discussing moon landing hoax theories, I think it&#39;s important to distinguish between two very different possibilities:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#39;s all a big lie and we have never landed on the moon.  </p></li>
<li><p>There was tremendous pressure to land before 1970 to fulfill JFK&#39;s big promise. As the deadline approached, NASA had everything worked out and tested except for the actual landing itself, and they weren&#39;t sure if they could put it together in time without taking too much risk. In a moment of desperation, they decided to run Apollo 11 as another Lunar orbit with Lunar Module descent (similar to Apollo 10), but then faked the landing itself. At least some of the later Apollo missions were legitimate.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Personally, I put a lot more credibility into the second theory. This is the kind of cover-up that really makes sense from the standpoint of national pride/security. The program was so massive and so much of it was independently confirmed in real time that I have a hard time believing it was all just a big show. </p>

That being said, the shadows look exactly the same to me on both sides. You’re viewing pic 1 from a more acute angle. The stars are equally in shadow and the edge angles all look the same. </p>

<p>My source illustrates the opposite in that a collimated laser beam will decolimiate over distance because of diffraction so the photon stream is 2km wide on average which allows reflection of a few photons by the briefcase sized reflector.</p>

<p>even at 2km, its implausible that the beam would hit the intended target at over 200,000 miles away. </p>

<p>furthermore, if they have the technology to track the moon accurately enough to hit a reflector with a laser, then there would be even less need for a reflector </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reflector is small and not visible to telescopes.</p>

<p>its not visible because its not there. </p>

<p>and even if it was there, you couldn&#39;t find it with a telescope or a laser </p>

<p>fancy, but unnecessary </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason for the reflectors was to determine accurately the movement of the moon over time relative to earth.</p>

<p>as a taxpayer, why is this exorbitant expenditure so important to you?</p>

<p>can you describe any practical, tangible effects this will have on your life?</p>
