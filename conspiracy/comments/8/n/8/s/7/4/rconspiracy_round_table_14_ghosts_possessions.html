    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re aware of being a ghost when we die.  A lot of ghost experiences and evidence point to a &quot;ghost&quot; being a sort of residual energy stored in a particular place.  So it&#39;s not a conscious spirit or entity; it&#39;s like an old recording playing over and over again.  Over time it gets weaker until it fades away.  </p>

<p>With so much of the spiritual reality unknown, it could be any number of things. Maybe they can impart knowledge and wisdom to younger generations in dreams, or through other methods. Alternatively, maybe ghosts act as scarecrows to non-human malevolent spirits (what some might call &quot;demons&quot;) who might wish to harm people, warding them away from human populations.</p>

<p>Or maybe there is no advantage at all. Maybe it&#39;s a side-effect to another advantageous trait. Say, humans having some ability to slightly manipulate reality through focus or strong emotions (magick)... When we die, we just naturally expel the last of our magickal energy, creating a Death Imprint/Ghost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When my mother was about 5 years old, she drowned on the beach. She only remembers swallowing water and then she wasn&#39;t in her body anymore. She was looking at her body from meters and meters above, almost from the clouds. She looked at her body and she didn&#39;t understand what was going on - my grandfather was running desperately to save her, my grandmother was desperate, and then finally a lifeguard saved her life. When my mother came back, she described the scene in details to my grandma and my grandma said it was completely accurate. </p>

<p>When my mom was 40 years old already, she felt her body very light when she was sleeping. She dreamed about flying over my uncle&#39;s house and saw him signing a contract, he was buying his new house. The next day, she called him and asked if he had bought a new house the evening before . He said &quot;How do you know that? I signed the contract last night&quot;. </p>

<p>We can recreate an out of body experience by either suffocating your brain for abit or with a wee bit of DMT. </p>

<p>Guess what chemical your brain releases in your sleep and guess what happens when you are dying? Thats right low O2 and the release of DMT. </p>

<p>As for the anecdotal thing about the the house... Come on. </p>

<p>If there is an afterlife God is a cunt for fucking with your mum like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, taking DMT can invoke an out of body response from your consciousness. Do you deny that this is real? Or are you just playing it down to &quot;just tripping&quot;?<br/>
Discovering the link between DMT and the way it interacts with a beings consciousness could be the key to building a model for the way consciousness acts beyond the body. It&#39;s no coincidence that people most often experience out of body experiences on DMT, living their lives from birth to death, and &quot;breaking through&quot; to higher dimensions at high doses. DMT allows you to remove your consciousness from the confines of the body and temporarily experience existence beyond it, but from the perspective as the &quot;you&quot; that you are at the point in time when taking the chemical. </p>

<p>Im playing it down to &quot;The chemistry in your brain is so out of whack it produces altered states&quot; </p>

<p>Ive done DMT and it certainly has a long term meaningful effect on your body and brain. </p>

<p>Hallucinating shuts down most of you brain and elevates activity in the default mode complex. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if I believe in ghosts or not, but if I did, I think the idea of ghosts being your whole spirit has always been too idealistic to be real.</p>

<p>I see ghosts more as Death Imprints. They&#39;re your strongest thoughts and emotions from the moment you died, given life as accidental thought forms by the last of your energy exiting your body. The Imprint left behind on the world is no more &quot;you&quot; than the corpse in the ground.</p>

<p>And unless the Imprint is consistently fed more energy, I think it makes sense that it would eventually fade from existence altogether.</p>

The idea behind it is pretty interesting, imo, especially if you are interested in anything like that. Theres so many good books you can find online for free. Im kinda partial because back in the day the author was one of my college professors in a death and dying course but the book, &quot;life after life&quot; is good too just to get a kinda overview and general idea of some different aspects of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Dr. Barry Taff has a pretty good theory.  It&#39;s summarized in <a href="http://realitysandwich.com/232618/demystifying-the-paranormal-dr-barry-taff-unravels-the-poltergeist-mystery/">this article</a> from Reality Sandwich.  </p>

<p>In short: Taff lists three variables that act together in concert to produce the physical manifestations of a good old-fashioned haunting: 1) The haunted site is located in an electromagnetically (EMF) anomalous environment 2) The poltergeist agent is usually prone to seizures or epileptic, and their biomagnetic field emits well over one million times the amplitude compared to the average person and 3) The poltergeist agent is neurologically wired in a way, usually an inability to cope with stress, that enables their nervous system to hyper-react to said environment and wreak paranormal havoc.</p>

<p>“Once these conditions are met, all bets are off,” Dr. Taff bluntly assures, “anything could occur.” So, if you’d like to, imagine all your deep-seated, psychological frustrations and anxieties literally coming to life, as it were, and going bump in the night…</p>

<p>Someone else listed this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=554bkSaK6kM">talk by Dr. Taff</a> last week and I found it very interesting.  I hope others will too.  </p>

<p>Full disclosure: I believe in ghosts.  I am an amateur paranormal investigator.  I&#39;ve seen and experienced some weird stuff, but nothing that made me say for sure &quot;that&#39;s a ghost.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what you just explained falls COMPLETELY in line with the comment I just posted above. I think it probably has to do with specific areas of the brain which control embodiment (understanding that your body and brain are the same) getting shut down and literally allowing another spinning energy to make a visit... one which might register quite a bit stronger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can actually view this via EEG, the frontal lobes &quot;mis&quot; fire and they don&#39;t know enough about the brain. My frontal lobes will do this but I am completely aware of my surroundings and do not go into epilepsy. I can tell you that when this happens I am hyper aware of my surroundings and know things about people that most would not know. It is not like you can read minds but you just know who that person is, like all the dark stuff. Everyone has the capacity to be ignorant, to do the wrong thing, but it is almost like you can sense that the person actually likes to be dark. Does that make sense and when you are in that particular fraction and your brain is misfiring you can sometimes know what that dark shit is. Really strange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This fits in very well, and yes if certain chunks of the brain get shut down that form that barrier, that embodiment, it&#39;s totally possible that you become more aware of other people&#39;s energies around you.
I&#39;m actually willing to venture and say that putting yourself in sensory deprivation (already shown to increase your senses) while tripping butt (using for example DMT) inside <a href="https://youtu.be/8j9uHyDSH0s">these</a> coffins (acting as insulation pretty much) might allow the layperson to do similar things in terms of manipulating the embodiment chunks of the brain... maybe allowing you to feel outside your skull.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that is a theory, they can view this via an EEG. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that detects electrical activity in your brain using small, metal discs (electrodes) attached to your scalp. Your brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are active all the time, even when you&#39;re asleep. This activity shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the mother of all conspiracies. </p>

<p>Gonna do this bullet point-style. </p>

<p>We live in a matrix </p>

<p>We are here because someone wants us here for some reason. Perhaps we are in a prison. Perhaps we are an energy source. But we are trapped here no matter what. </p>

<p>When we die, they put us back in the matrix. The catch is, we have to agree to go. </p>

<p>The way back into the matrix is by walking into the light. </p>

<p>They trick you into going to the light by subliminally making sure that you are fed this idea of &quot;walk towards the light&quot; in movies and tv shows all your life. They also have your relatives there guiding you to the light (these are not your relatives - these are probably just code). </p>

<p>We live our life, die, go back in the matrix, and the circle repeats itself. </p>

<p>We could be here forever and ever. It could never end. They have us mentally enslaved. </p>

<p>How do we get out? I believe that the only true way out of here is finding enlightenment through meditation - but this is no easy feat. </p>

<p>The original historical Buddha said that we live in a world of illusion. He said that matter didn&#39;t exist. He said that meditation is the key to liberation. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still looking into all of this, but I&#39;ll tell you this - when I die, I&#39;m not walking towards the light. I&#39;ll take a good look around first. </p>

<p>We are in a matrix - proven

<p>Which lead to them changing to the forward strutted CFM56 highbypass in the 737-300/500/700 model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not a conspiracy. What’s a conspiracy and the biggest one I’ve encountered is the mandela effect cover up. You may know that engines point out in front but bet many people you know don’t. Just ask them. This is one you can find out yourself. Just ask people where thy recall Statue of Liberty being. Liberty island or Ellis island. Many will think Ellis. Or what does the thinker statue look like. Or American gothic painting.  Is it looney tunes or looney toons ?  Fabreeze/ febreeze or febreze.  What does the ford logo look like ? Has the Coca Cola logo looked like that since 1913 ?  What colour is the A team van ? Do they recall John Goodman dying ? Did Mickey Mouse have braces ? </p>

<p>Just look for yourself and ask. There are thousands. Some will know things as they are. But many will recall things as they were. And all in the same wrong way. </p>

Of course, if you know anything at all about aerospace engineering, the engine and wing design is <em>the primary area of optimization for flight</em> meaning the fuselage doesn’t change much but the orientation of the engine struts do.  Mostly this would not be readily discernible except from blueprints.</p>

<p>Also, please!  Tell me how many times I have been on an airplane, lol!</p>

<p>Is that some measure of <em>sophistication</em> or <em>intelligence</em> or <em>coolness</em> to you!?  Or do you presume to learn about aviation engineering by <em>osmosis</em>; the more time you spend on an airliner the more you suddenly know about them?  </p>

<p>How much time have you spent on a sailing yacht?  Bullet train?  Hot air ballon?  Lmao, I am not sure how to even calculate whatever <em>pissing contest</em> you seem to implying with that.  You are not from the first world maybe?  Being on an airplane impresses your people?  Maybe you are the first in your village to obtain passage on the <em>metal bird</em>!?</p>

<p>The humorous part is that I have not spent a great deal of time on commercial airliners, yet I have a friend who is an enthusiast pilot and has a private plane and I have spent a great deal of time on pleasure flights and have taken the controls on multiple occasions.  How does that one compare in your worldview?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The humerus part is that you have not spent a great deal of time on commercial airliners. Yeah I know that’s why I said it. Wasn’t trying to have a pissing contest. It’s just an observation. As it happens I have and I recall very vividly never seeing the engines petruding like that. </p>

<p>Engines work under the wing or petruded  forward. I’m not debating whether it works or not. We’ve seen engines work in the tail and all sorts. Thrust and speed are the important factors. It’s just for many the engines were under the wings that is all. </p>

<p>Anyway here’s stuff you haven’t heard of </p>

<p>Ribbon seals
Rainbow trees
Rainbow mountains 
Saiga antelope
Okapi 
Gremlin monkeys 
Purple tarantulas 
And the little piggy tail in the ford logo. </p>

<p>Well if you have heard of any not before 2016.  Now am I psychic ? Or is something else going on ? </p>

<p>What is your point with that list?  I am not going to bother searching those, are “rainbow trees” the common name for some species or is that something else?  There are a fuck ton of trees any person on earth has not heard of, are you familiar with <em>malcura pomifera</em>?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We were talking about simulation theory. As for rainbow mountains they are in China. I’m not trying to show off I’m really not. Why would I know that you have t heard of most of those. Yet I name a couple of other obscure animals. Like the Mongolian fox. I’m pretty sure when you google it you’ll recognise it. </p>

<p>As for the mountains. I’ve been in the Himalayas. Also. Atlas Mountains and up Kilimanjaro. I am no mountaineer but I love a trek and something different rather than sitting on a beach getting caned.  But I’d never heard of the rainbow mountains. Nor has anyone I know before 2016. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are also ones in Peru.  When I googled it to verify, it comes back with those first.  Dunno.</p>

<p>Also I haven’t specifically heard of the Mongolian fox any more than a ribbon seal, I mean I am not an avid “animal enthusiast” to know a ton of different species, lol, but do have an interest in dendrology and tree/plant identification.  My interest in that is particular to the USA so you could literally name <em>millions</em> of species of plants that I have never heard of.  </p>

<p>I have seen pictures of those “rainbow trees” but I couldn’t give an exact timeframe, I believe it was from search engine junk when looking for something specific, one of those “10 amazing looking trees from around the world” type things.  Also listed was the <em>Amur Cherry</em> which is also rather wild looking.</p>

<p>Btw:  there are apparently many <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/01/21/welcome-rainbow-mountains-peru/#1f42b7126f70">rainbow mountains</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting those mountains being in Canada as well. Wasn’t aware of that they crop up everywhere </p>

<p>Fair point about nature. I was a bit of a closet nature geek to be honest. </p>

<p>I’m referring to the common mistake most people have of South America being south of USA. Not south east.  </p>

<p><a href="https://ibb.co/jKLD7d">which one looks right to you ?</a> </p>

<p>Ok some specific USA questions.  Does Mount Rushmore look like you recall. Ie George Washington had that shirt ? </p>

<p>Do you recall Statue of Liberty being on Ellis island ?</p>

<p>Have you heard about the black Tom explosion ?</p>

<p>Have you heard of the field of giant presidents heads ? </p>

<p>Not sure how old you are but did you watch the A team and do you know the colour of the van ? </p>

<p>And do you remember Mickey Mouse having braces ? Used to run his thumbs down his braces saying “hello Pluto” </p>

<p>Was it fruit loops or froot loops for you ?</p>

<p>Do you remember John goodman dieing ? </p>

<p>How long ago did robin Williams die ? </p>

<p>They aren’t trick questions I would have got all of these wrong. The one that got me was six people in the car with JFK for me there was only four and I can tell you all about the driver William Greer. I have no clue about Roy kellerman and what he’s doing in the car. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The South America thing I think is the effect of different map projections, most people are used to the Mercator one (whew, don’t ask how I remember that, lol, it is like 1066 William of Normandy, one of those things I remembered without ever trying).  </p>

<p>Okay:</p>

<p>Mount Rushmore, Washington always had a faint lapel outline but I am not sure if that is what you mean, I think he has a cravat also.</p>

<p>“Lady Liberty” was always on Liberty island, immigrants went to Ellis island, <em>this is literally why immigrants in paintings and even “An American Tail” the cartoon are looking across the bay to the Statue of Liberty</em>!  If the statue were on Ellis Island, they would be looking up her skirt!</p>

<p>No clue about Black Tom.  Never heard of it.</p>

<p>The A-team van was dark grey or black with an orange stripe.  Not old enough to watch it but a guy in my town has a replica of if.  (Or did he get it wrong!?)</p>

<p>Don’t recall Mickey Mouse having braces ever.  Was this like a single cartoon short?  (Like the old ones where each cartoon was its own story and Mickey did all sort of different stuff?  I can easily imagine they may have made an episode where he has braces.)</p>

<p>Was always “Froot Loops” common American marketing crap where it is misspelled.  The O’s on both Froot and Loop used pictures of the cereal.  I would imagine that any confusion is just that people have a built in “spellcheck” that flils in crorect splelings aotumatically, like how you can read that with no problem!</p>

<p>Field of President heads!?  Are you combining Mt. Rushmore with Easter Island!?  Never heard that one before.  (Sorry, out of order.)</p>

<p>I met John Goodman randomly in New Orleans a few years ago at a restaurant!  I <em>have</em> heard of this Mandela Effect thing online before but that is the only place I know of hearing it.</p>

<p>Seems like Robin Williams only died a year or two ago, but the way time flies I am guessing it was probably more like 5 or more.  Movies that came out in 2005 still seem “recent” to me, part of getting older?</p>

<p>That’s is off the top of my head, you gotta tell me if I got the “right” or not (or if I have false memories!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Robin Williams died in 2014. Four years ago. </p>

<p>And yes all the others you are have got right. Though for me rather of Liberty was on Ellis island. I don’t know Mount Rushmore well enough. </p>

<p>As for the a team van. It was always all black with a red stripe. I saw the same clip change from a black van to the one with a grey top.  </p>

<p>As for South America. Ok the map thing. Just try and find any map at all that has it under the USA where many recall it ? </p>

<p>There are literally hundreds. Though if you’re under 26 we seem to find you’ll likely know what it is now than what many of us recall. We may be from different dimensions. Who knows. It’s very strange though. </p>

<p>As for Easter island. Some of the statues now have hats. And the islander were not wiped out. I clearly recall the island being deserted when re discovered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am over 30.  I usually have a very sharp memory (like for random details more than for stuff I need to remember, so maybe it is all about perception?)</p>

<p>I realized the South America thing, it looks like it is under the USA <em>on a globe</em>!  (Well angle is crucial, but the roundness makes the illusion, not the map projection so much.</p>

<p>I remember the hats on Easter Island from some paranormal shows in the 90’s, the guy was trying to figure out the pattern or if the hats meant they were kings or something like that.  I <em>also</em> remember hearing that everyone left the island because they cut down all the trees to move the heads and the island became inhospitable!  (I <em>will</em> admit that reeks of some Aesop’s fable type thing about the folly of environmental damage so I wouldn’t be too shocked to learn it was an exaggeration.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dunno that advertising is a valid thing... brands change their marketing constantly.  For example it was always “<em>The</em> Home Depot” on the logo but their commercials used to simply say “Home Depot”.  Not a conspiracy, just different slogans.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Arrogance ?  If you were in any way open to this you’d ask for some proof. Some sort of evidence instead of calling me arrogant. As for brands. Don’t you think that’s what we all thought at first. When I saw the dash in kit Kat had gone I assumed a re brand. Or the arrow in the Volvo logo. Or the vw sign being separate instead of one vw crossed in the middle. Or the ford logo with the pigs tail in it. ? </p>

<p>Surely it’s arrogant to assume someone is lying to you and suggesting history algae changed without asking for proof. </p>

<p>I’m not interested in convincing anyone. But you seem interested in convincing me I’m wrong. I just found out about zealandia today. Never heard of it or those two ridges that seem to come out the top of it.  Sri Lanka has also lived for me. And I live in the Uk and am Scottish. Before it was impossible to see Ireland from Scotland. Now you can.  </p>

<p>You didn’t mention whether or not you were surprised at robin Williams death in 2014. </p>

<p>How about Aretha Franklin is still alive ? Diana ross died for me about 12 years ago yet she’s still here. All very strange stuff. </p>

<p>Re the Home Depot. I have family in the states. So whilst I may not know brands that well here for some reason American brands stick in the mind better maybe it’s because I just am more aware of my surroundings when in the states. But I don’t recall the Home Depot. Bit like I recall Jc penny and not jc Penney. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not directly calling you arrogant, I am saying there is some arrogance in the entire idea “I am not <em>wrong</em>, they <em>changed the whole world</em>!”</p>

<p>Surely you can see the arrogance in that thought?</p>

<p>I had to look up the Volvo thing, I thought you meant they <em>removed</em> the arrow, then I would have believed you since the Volvo logo has always been the male emblem!  That was the first car my parents had since I was alive and I remember it well, a 1980 240D with a standard transmission.  Are you saying you <em>didn’t</em> know it had an arrow!?</p>

<p>Now the VW one, I know for a fact it has appeared with and without the little line dividing the V and W...  as depicted <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9d/88/a4/9d88a40bdcd4937365e03d9e57d6208f.jpg">here</a> so we agree on that one!</p>

<p>Not surprised about Robin Williams, like I said when you asked, I thought it seemed like a year or two but I supposed it could easily be more like 5, so 4 years ago is pretty much exactly in the timeframe I mentioned.</p>

<p>I knew Aretha Franklin isn’t dead, why do you think she is?  Are you confusing her with Whitney Houston?  She died a while back (edit: Wikipedia says 2012, had to fact-check myself).</p>

<p>Re: countries or islands, there are tons we haven’t heard of because they are not relevant to world news, I had never heard of the Azores until about 5 years ago while reading a travelogue book, that never made me think it was invented just because it never crossed my conscious awareness previously.  Look at a detailed world map, I am sure we could each list 100 islands or countries the other has never heard of.</p>

<p>Also, JC Penny, if you had asked me the spelling before gaining me the correct one I couldn’t have said for certain despite there being one I pass on my daily commute,we just don’t pay much attention to these things (for the record, I probably would have spelt it correctly, not because I know but because I would have spelt “penny” the same as the coin.)</p>

Don’t know how you missed that arrow, I remember asking my mom if the Volvo was only for dads when I learned the male and female symbols and noticed it on the car.  </p>

<p>The anatomy, I have a vague and general idea of where organs are, not enough to actually be surprised if my knowledge isn’t very accurate, I am going by memories of those “take apart” organ models in high school.  I am not a physician or nurse so I have never studied anatomy in depth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t so much a simulation.  We live in the 3rd dimension, which is a low vibrational frequency.  We aren&#39;t able to manifest reality very well in a lose vibrational state.  Thus it&#39;s easier to &quot;trick&quot; spirits into certain ways of thinking and believing here.  And yes the Elites and aliens are working together to keep us here but they can&#39;t FORCE us to.  They can only trick us into agreeing to stay.  And a lot of us are fooled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s not <em>&quot;fake&quot;</em>, but it definitely is a simulation. Sure, everything in regards to this life is illusory and the result of the interference pattern of a universal wave function. Nothing of this life is &quot;fundamental&quot; to reality. We&#39;re the surface ripples on a pond - constantly changing. But does that make it all fake? Not necessarily. The emotions I feel are real. The interactions I have in life are real. Everything I go through in this life - in its own respect - is real. It has something tangible and useful that you can take from it. It might just be a big LARP as we souls roleplay in these bodies, but most people have forgotten that. Most people are playing as if this is the real thing, so in that regard, as far as most people are concerned, this reality is real. It might be a simulation among an infinite number of others, but that doesn&#39;t make it any less real. It just means there&#39;s an infinite number of alternative realities and other ways that &quot;real&quot; can represent itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By &quot;simulation&quot; I don&#39;t mean as in a computer-based simulation, but that reality (as we know it) effectively acts as a consciousness-based simulation due to it not being the only one. Let&#39;s say that this reality that we&#39;re currently experiencing exists at a particular &quot;base frequency&quot;, or that things based in this reality generally act within a particular range of frequencies, so that they are able to definitively interact with other things based in these frequencies. But the thing with frequency is that it&#39;s a continuum. There is no end to the rate of frequencies on either end.<br/>
So, let&#39;s take for example the differences between rocks, water/air, and gamma radiation. The atoms that make up rocks vibrate at a relatively slow rate. It&#39;s what keeps the atoms in a fault uniform structure (depending on the rock) and stops the rock from melting at room temperature or running away by itself. The atoms that make up the cells of our skin have different vibrations. Generally they&#39;re faster, to allow for greater energy transfer between the atoms, and thus also between the cells. There&#39;s a relative fluidity to the skin, from the rocks perspective. At least with all those cells that carry out duties, die, then get replaced by other cells so quickly. But this higher frequency interaction, over the span of the entire skin organ, comes to form a pretty decent interference pattern which, from our human perspective, seems pretty solid. With air and water, their atoms again act at higher frequencies than both the atoms that make up the skin, and those of the rock. Between these three we can see that the immediate effect of the interactions between the rock and water or air are minimal. At least when you&#39;re taking the same amount of each and comparing them with each other, each as a whole, immediately. But if you look at their effects on each other on an atomic scale, or as whole but over an extended period of time, then you can see the fire extents of their effects on one another. Then we can look at gamma rays. Gamma rays are extremely high frequency electromagnetic radiation. We humans simply don&#39;t have the biological equipment to pick up gamma rays. Gamma rays normally go straight through us with no problem. We have no biological way to register them, despite the high frequency response of the atoms that make up our cells, because when the cells come together and form systems and organs the result is that the organs and systems that the cells and atoms comprise operate on/within a different set of frequencies to those that the individual cells/atoms do. The only way we even know that gamma rays exist is through technology. Since we don&#39;t have the biological equipment to register them we needed to create a new piece of equipment that could pick up on them.<br/>
So we can see that at the high end of things there exists phenomena which operate at frequencies that are too high for us to register in any natural way, yet still occupy the same space. That&#39;s an example of multiple realities existing on top of one another, yet due to their different &quot;base frequencies&quot; they don&#39;t directly interact with one another and generally will just do their own thing. Due to the fact that one reality has no immediate effect on the other, then from the perspective of one of the realities, it would be like the other is effectively a simulation. Doesn&#39;t make it any less real, as it totally is real within its own right. But from either one perspective the other just doesn&#39;t necessarily matter as it has no &quot;real&quot; effect on their respective &quot;reality&quot;.<br/>
In regards to your questions there, when we die we go to another reality. A higher dimension. The &quot;you&quot; who you were in this life doesn&#39;t cease to exist, as there&#39;s the data to prove that that respective existence existed through time and space. You could trace your path from death back to birth with the right equipment. But the &quot;you&quot; that exists now isn&#39;t just the you that you were in that life. You &quot;remember&quot; that you are the culmination of all the different lives you&#39;ve lived <em>on top of</em> the most recent life you&#39;ve lived. It&#39;s sorta like coming out of a video game and remembering that that video game you wasn&#39;t the real you, but just one expression, and that you are the culmination of all the video game characters and games you&#39;ve ever played <em>as well as</em> all the stuff that was going on between playing video games. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about this theory...  <em>so what?</em></p>

<p>If we are in a simulation, so what?  Nothing we can do about it; code can’t leave the computer.  If we are all simulated the eternal soul and any meaning is just another bit of programmed illusion.  If we are in a simulation, you don’t mean anything, I don’t mean anything, there isn’t some “waking up” there isn’t enlightenment, there is no point because none of any of these mean anything to code.</p>

<p>If we are replayed again and again, so what?  </p>

<p>It is just absurdity and pointlessness.</p>

<p>I am not even saying you are wrong, just that if you are right it <em>means nothing</em>. </p>

<p>But, to be honest this just seems like some non-religious version of the same scared hope that there is “something” beyond and that when we die it isn’t just all over.  A religion for the non-religious.  It is just fear and hubris.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is weird. Sometimes I&#39;ll &quot;remember&quot; a glimpse of an emotion that I felt in a dream recently, almost like a fraction of a memory although I can never seem to remember what it was that happened in the dream to make me feel that way. It&#39;s like something in my life triggers an emotional response that reminds me of an extremely strong emotion that I know I felt in a dream previously. Emotion isn&#39;t even the right word really it&#39;s more like an underlying state of mind that we don&#39;t have the vocabulary to describe or the capacity to relate to our everyday lives in order to consciously understand it. Yet I know with 100% certainty there was some &quot;time&quot; in a dream I had that I am being reminded of, even though I don&#39;t know what it was or how exactly I am being reminded of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry - I don&#39;t get angry about this stuff. I love talking about it, and always looking for different perspectives. I don&#39;t think any of us know anything for sure. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the brain is involved though - that is part of the &quot;old&quot; body, the dead carcass we are leaving behind. I think our consciousness is freed from this mortal vehicle that we call &quot;the body&quot; and we take on another form. The new form (or old form - predating our earthly existence) is the more permanent form, and (according to NDE survivors) appears to be just as solid as the body you are in now. </p>

<p>As far as walking towards light, or frequency ranges or whatnot - I would imagine that what you say is perhaps true, as everything seems to be frequency... but it doesn&#39;t really address the central thrust of what I&#39;m getting at, which is that the whole process of reincarnation is a giant con-trick on humanity. </p>

<p>Always open to hearing more thoughts tho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a <em>matrix</em> per se, but the Buddah did say the path to ending suffering is through enlightenment, reaching nirvana, stopping the cycle of samsara (reincarnation).
Here&#39;s the thing though - when you die, there isn&#39;t anything there. It&#39;s just nothingness. The reason that meditation allows you to reach nirvana is a type of training - you have to be happy with doing nothing with your life. Are you happy when you meditate? What do you think about? Does it heighten your senses? Does it make you more aware of your surroundings? And what, then, if you had no senses? And if you can meditate and reach that sort of enlightenment, forever, then you might be ready for it - I think.</p>

<p>This is a photo of a ghost I took at Chillingham castle about six years ago. The black thing most definitely was not there. About three years ago I saw a ghost in our warehouse. As have many others who worked there, big burley blokes terrified to go to the toilet on their own lol. </p>

<p>I also lived in a haunted house in bakewell Derbyshire called the hall. It’s searchable on the net and for any of you yanks want to see what a real haunted house looks like. That’s one. </p>

<p>I grew up knowing small things just jumped. It was totally normal to me till about the age of 7. It didn’t phase me one bit and when we moved it was kind of strange small things didn’t jump. </p>

<p>Are there ghosts ? Yes 100% there are. I took a photo of one I know what you see there was not there.  I know anyone else would have to be skeptical but there it is.  Afterlife ? Yes we live in a situation and this is actually the non real state, so in fact we return to life if that makes sense, and yes we return. As for souls in purgatory ? I don’t know. Maybe there is a place in between the two realities. </p>

<p>And what we do here resonates in the other world I’m fairly sure of that.  </p>

<p>Hope you like the pic </p>

<p>Autist chiming in here. Pattern recognition is definitely one of my strengths, but whereas others tend to very much antromorphosise patterns, I have found that is a trait that I lack. A very simple (and not entirely accurate) example: my mind might go &quot;neat, the clouds resemble two dots and a curve&quot;, while some other people might think &quot;neat, the clouds resemble a happy face&quot;.</p>

Anyway. My entry won 1st Place and Best of Show so my aunt called me and said, &quot;General, hang on to your hat!&quot; And all I could do was reach onto my head where my Marriott&#39;s Great America visor rested, and said anxiously, &quot;Which ONE??!!&quot;<br/>
I did not understand metaphor, turns of phrase or any linguistic tricks as I expected adults to be direct and that there would be dire consequences if I did not, indeed, hang on to the correct hat. Perhaps my green plastic visor was the hat referred to and it somehow was worth a lot of money because Shaun Cassidy touched it? Or because one of the Banana Splits wore it as they slid down the slide in the intro to their show? Who KNOWS?<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I once worked nights in an old hospital and got to know nurses that had been working there for a long time. I was speaking with a lady who was relating that she&#39;d seen a particular figure repeatedly over the passage of many years and had noticed a funny thing - over time the figure&#39;s feet/ lower legs were no longer visible.</p>

<p>I looked into this and discovered that the floor level in that area had been raised over time - I have encountered a theory suggesting that stone/ water can act to store event data in a way not understood. This would fit well with the example I gave above - like a psychic recording which is periodically replayed. The lady I spoke to was nearing retirement, the head nurse on the ward and unlikely to be making this up for a giggle. Experience of &#39;weird stuff&#39; was fairly common among the nursing staff</p>

She said he had no family that visited him at all, no friends etc.  She said a minister came and prayed with him and that was about it.  She said he was so weak that he could barely speak and just held on for the longest time.  When he eventually started to die he began to scream and thrash, had inhuman strength and begged the nurses to pull his feet from the fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like a lot of folks here, I&#39;m very interested in these topics. Skeptical, but open to documented evidence and science. I appreciate James Randi who helps debunk fake claims of supernatural powers. But there are things he cannot explain. Anyone who studies physics already knows that the nature of matter, energy, and consciousness are still not fully understood. </p>

<p>One example that springs to mind are children with details past life stories. Hoax? Or is it possible our &quot;minds&quot; live on after our bodies expire? Here&#39;s a story of a child who was born with memories of a fighter pilot who died in war. Really hope science can tell us more about the phenomena.

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, I spend a fair amount of time on conspiracies and that&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard anyone suggest that nuclear bombs are a lie. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t see much specific evidence, but I appreciated this quote from a user:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the people the Skeptics attack are making money from more or less bogus claims. For example, &#39;psychic surgeons&#39; in the Philippines make what appears to them a fortune from simple trickery. The people who pay them do it voluntarily. The audiences in spiritualist performances, or mind-reading acts, and the consumers of absurd &#39;flower&#39; remedies or tablets with no active ingredients, are all more or less adults. Why shouldn&#39;t they pay their money? Most of the crits by Skeptics are of failed cults, or failing… But &#39;Skeptics&#39; don&#39;t criticise serious abuses of power. There&#39;s nothing much on Freemasons or Jews or Mormons or Catholics… What about mass killings and chemical warfare in Vietnam? The &#39;Skeptics&#39; said nothing. What about Coca Cola in the third world, where what they need is clean water? What about tobacco companies? What about NASA? What about the detail of science - the endoplasmic reticulum as a fraud, criticisms of immunology, the nonsense about &#39;AIDS&#39;? What about 9/11? And what about nuclear issues, which this site is addressing? The &#39;Skeptics&#39; attack in inverse proportion to the seriousness of the issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This article had more actual evidence than the one you posted earlier, thank you. </p>

<p>Super interesting to read that the 9-11 commission report said the NSA didn&#39;t know that one of the hijackers whose calls they were intercepting was in the US. William Binney said there&#39;s no way they didn&#39;t know. So did they not share that info? Or did the FBI or CIA (not sure whose jurisdiction) ignore it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if our brain is a quantum computer capable of integrating spinning electromagnetic brain waves into binary actions? </p>

<p>What if the pineal gland sitting smack in the center of gravity of it can split light through the use of calcite crystals (birefringence)? </p>

<p>What if we can learn from that splitting of light and combined with proteins like Cry3 can sense electromagnetic waves outside our skull (just like Finches)?</p>

<p>What if you can store entire concious operating systems in spinning electromagnetic energy (ala alexa)?</p>

<p>What if those spinning chunks of energy could exist in electromagnetic resonating cavities like the Earth&#39;s? (Schumann resonances)</p>

<p>And what if those energies can travel by hopping through &quot;gravity&quot; (I put it in quotes because gravity being essentially the difference in concentration of energy at a given area, travel would be like traveling through a fluid) to other sources of electromagnetic energy? (Think a sink and a drain).
Yes, putting these concepts together is heavily facilitated by a unified theory of physics (which has been found but is for a separate post), it at the very least explains the physical pieces that can give rise to these phenomena, and that&#39;s the first step in starting to piece this apart I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Naw, it&#39;s actually far simpler than holorfractal (as a more correct description of our universe should be) if curious it&#39;s called Tetryonics by Kelvin Abraham. What makes it different than others is that it yields things like a 3d periodic table which you can use like Lego blocks to build up from, from elements to functional groups to amino acids and nucleotides to proteins and DNA etc etc yielding the correct measured atomic structures (using things like CryoEM or x ray crystallography).
The theory is testable and explains things like quantum entanglement simply, and in an intuitive manner (not mathemagical)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That theory is definitely not mine and the theory explains physics and all the building blocks to go from the bottom up, what can be made with it is anyone&#39;s guess... but it definitely lays the groundwork for understanding that we might already be part of a bigger whole (which is super exciting imo)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have died and come back several times. There is nothing there. It is a dmt trip basically. I tried to kill myself at age 13, died, was revived, had my stomach pumped and all that fun shit. I had alcohol poisoning and died a couple of times in my twenties and thirties. I overdosed on hydrocodone, amphetamine  and whiskey at age 27 and died. A few years back I was getting drunk all day, eating amphetamine and oxycodone and drinking liquor heavily as usual, I was offered some heroin which I accepted... yep wound up dead in a hospital. So each time I left this realm in which we exist I felt nothing other than something comparable to a very brief acid trip. I&#39;m not exactly sure how long I was dead on any particular instance, but it sure felt final. When you are laying on a table surrounded by fuckers wearing scrubs and masks using strange instruments on you, it makes me feel like a prick. It&#39;s happened so many times. I just wanted to fucking die. Let me. I&#39;m still alive obviously, but let me tell you something... dying is the ultimate high. No drug compares to it and I&#39;ve done everything, just to escape myself. I guess that certain chemicals are released in the brain and you trip balls right before. I didn&#39;t see any fucking angels or demons or any of that shit. Whatever, just throwing out my experience for anybody interested. Not many folks have died as much as me. Whatever I can add to the conversation... You fucking die. You trip balls for about one minute. Yada yada yada. They burn you to ashes or bury you in a box. End of story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your brain can live for up to 20-30 minutes after your heart &quot;stops&quot; before your neural synapses begin to break apart irretrievably. If you were truly dead, there would be no bringing you back.</p>

<p>Some religions believe the soul does not depart from the body immediately. Others believe that your body and soul are indistinguishable, but that you &quot;sleep&quot; in your grave until such time that your body is supernaturally &quot;resurrected&quot; from the grave.</p>

<p>Being passed out or flatlined for a few minutes does not genuinely constitute &quot;death&quot;, and just because you did not have an experience while being &quot;on the edge&quot; doesn&#39;t invalidate what others claim to have experienced. It certainly doesn&#39;t &quot;disprove&quot; some form of after-life.</p>

<p>But.. this is all just, like, my opinion, man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Edge...There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. The others-the living-are those who pushed their control as far as they felt they could handle it, and then pulled back, or slowed down, or did whatever they had to when it came time to choose between Now and Later. But the edge is still Out there.<br/>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;According to Washington&#39;s original DCS report — an account corroborated by Walker, the nurse — the 9-year-old had a &quot;weird grin&quot; and walked backward up a wall to the ceiling. He then flipped over Campbell, landing on his feet. He never let go of his grandmother&#39;s hand.</p>

<p>&quot;He walked up the wall, flipped over her and stood there,&quot; Walker told The Star. &quot;There&#39;s no way he could&#39;ve done that.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To chime in aswell.</p>

<p>I got poisoned once (rare side effect from ibuprofen of all things) and had heartfailure. Took me around 6 hours to actually kick the bucket. At first i felt weaker and weaker, 1-2 hrs later i asked my GF to accompany me to the hospital since my mom was visiting and she kinda pushed me to go. Anyway i drove to the subway on my ebike and could already feel life slipping away.</p>

<p>Weaker and weaker by the minute now. Inside the subway 15 minutes in i told my gf...&quot;you know, i think there is a good chance that i will be dying today&quot; She obviously said &quot;Bullshit, you its just something you ate&quot; (she was kinda right)</p>

<p>Anyway got to the hospital (china) and after a bit of a wait they kinda figured i need to go to the ER. Got rushed there, my GF at my side holding my hand. I couldnt really move around anymore, i quickly wrote some last massages for friends and family, wrote down passwords and thought &quot;Fuck this will totally ruin my moms vacation.&quot; Stupid stuff i know.</p>

<p>The doctor was really shrill and annoying, his english wasnt good either...but since im still here i guess he knew what he was doing (which i dont really remember exactly in detail) anyway, the moment of death.</p>

<p>It was like being lowered into yourself. Into a Dark pit of pure Darkness. I thought to myself &quot;Crap, there aint anything here, well that fuckin sucks!&quot; the Dot of reality slowly closing and then nothing, no memory no anything. I just woke up having the doctor in my face yelling </p>

<p>&quot;HA HA YOU DIED, YOU VERY LUCKY HAHA.&quot; </p>

<p>I looked at my GF and she confirmed that i was like 20-30 seconds gone with open eyes. I recovered quite quickly and a few hours later i got discharged and reevaluated some things in my life.</p>

<p>One thing i highly recommend when you die. Have a loved one by your side when you die. I cant stress this enough. I also dont want to die in my sleep. I want to be &quot;there&quot; (again). </p>

<p>So unless this is the afterlife and i landed in hell (considering how fucked the world is) there isnt anything there. I checked it out.</p>

<p>Also a bit on the emotional side. I dont ever want to go back into the darkness. Its fucked there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That describes it perfectly! It takes a bit for certain concepts to take shape, but when they do its super exciting to understand something that before i was struggling to even get started on the very very basics. Sure i have to put in some ammount of work. But when you Instinctively understand something then its a breeze to go through the textbook and put names and equations to it. Socially im super isolated at the moment, but it actually doesnt bother me now.</p>

<p>I wasnt an idiot before, but i really wasnt all that smart. And up until now i didnt realize that this new found laserlike focus kinda started happening after i died.

<p>Some of the stuff I can do with my body and mind might even make monks wonder, I know it surprises a lot of doctors I talk with.

<p>But then again, i could have spend the concept of eternity in the darkness (if there is something like a soul) and wouldnt know since my body was dead it couldnt form any memories. as i mentioned before. The experience definetly changed me in many ways. All of which i love and enjoy. Still i do my darndest of not dying again, considering i used up my &quot;mulligan&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is more after the darkness, it&#39;s just difficult to get past. The next best method other then dying would be through the subconsciousness or dreaming. As the subconscious knows how to do most things associated with the body/mind, it&#39;s just a matter of giving it proper and truthful direction. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t die or w/e but I was in this pitch black void</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From what I understand of consciousness and death,  upon crossing over most people temporarily experience what they subconsciously expect to experience because our consciousness creates out reality.   When you pass from this density,  your create your reality much more instantaneously, because you are then nothing but consciousness.  It can take much &quot;time&quot; for a person who has died to realize that the limiting afterdeath environment they created for themselves isn&#39;t exactly real.  </p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve experienced the void you&#39;re  referring to, though.  I used to experiment with mega doses of Saliva Divinorum. I would do it ritualistically, asking for specific information before dosing and have extremely vivid visions beyond compare with anything else I&#39;ve ever experienced. </p>

<p>One evening,  I asked for insight into the nature of time,  and how we fit into it as human beings.  Upon dosing I was swept away to a void. I could FEEL within every bit of me the emptiness of this void.  I was so alone and aching for interaction and change and I then &quot;knew&quot; (was told) that this was a demonstration of our inability to change our spiritual evolutionary path when we are non-physical.  We can think and ponder and plan and imagine,  but we can&#39;t CHANGE anything.   Change and evolution of our spiritual being can only occur in the 3D realm (in our bodies).  We have to grow and expand and change things HERE, because when you go to the other side you lose your ability to manipulate your path and go into a kind of Idling Mode where you reflect on WTF just happened and how it affects your path. </p>

<p>The Void isn&#39;t where we will end up in death,  it is just an aspect of it which can be used to teach. </p>

<p>I came back from the vision imbued with an insane appreciation for the people around me.  I stood up off the floor and immediately went down the hall to interact with some people I previously didn&#39;t really like,  because we are here exactly for that. </p>

<p>I felt an amazing upswell of love for these guys who were basically previously-unliked-aquaintances and I do my best to keep in mind that the transformations we make to our soul in every single face-to-face interaction with real people is exactly why we are here. </p>

<p>We come here specifically for interactions with other souls in chemical clothes because we gain something from playing out the interactions here that we don&#39;t over there; every interaction is precious, even with people we think we despise.  We get to the other side and find out they were teachers merely providing needed resistance for your spiritual muscles to grow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I overdosed on Coricidon/basically robotripping sophomore year trying to break through the 4th dimension. I remember feeling like shit, I shouldn&#39;t of swallowed 20 pills as my stomach hurts so bad. Went to my room, stared at an Alex Grey poster as it started to move and transform and a soul arose out of the middle of the picture and I blacked out. I remember looking at myself on my bed from the ceiling of my room, flying out the window, and somewhere after that I died and was told it&#39;s not my time yet. Woke up 2 days later to my door off the hinges, parents were worried about me, somehow they knew my energy was slipping. Wish I remembered more but after this experience i never questioned if there was an afterlife. </p>

<p>For me it was like &#39;coming back&#39; to yourself! As in, you&#39;re your &#39;self&#39; before you were born, and you go back to your immortal &#39;self&#39; when you die.

    <div class="md"><p>You can read about witch trials and Salem etc... Blocula etc... Alto of it is Satan/devil worship and yes there are real witches. They are forward about it. Look at Yoko Ono album names.  She just admits it.</p>

<p>When you read about witch trials look at the accounts that the witches were charged from, not the emotional propaganda about what happened to the witches. Salem really happened and it still happens today. I always wanted to find the book Wonders of the unseen world by Cotton Mather. Im sure its erased from the internet for a reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has indeed been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  It&#39;s just that that proof continues to be denied by TPTB, and since the 99% allow themselves to be lead like blind rats by what TPTB say is and is not true, we&#39;ve allowed ourselves to be convinced that the negations of TPTB must mean &quot;the existence of paranormal phenomena hasn&#39;t been proven&quot;.</p>

<p>Little could be further from the actual truth.</p>

<p>Heck, the very fact that you yourself understand that there have indeed been millions (<em>millions</em>) of accounts is almost proof positive in itself.  You don&#39;t have &quot;a million&quot; of <strong><em>anything</em></strong> and the thing in question not actually exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Past life experiences anybody?  </p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/420509.Magick_Without_Tears">Magick Without Tears</a> Aleister Crowley gives a recipe for magickal memory which is simple enough that an average high school freshman could probably do it. <em>Everybody</em> I know who has done this has spooked them self.</p>

<p>Step I: meditate into full relaxed / theta state -- give it 20 minutes.  </p>

<p>Step II: mentally walk backwards chronologically through your life--yesterday, last week, last month, last year, 2 years back, 3 years back, &amp;c  </p>

<p>It probably helps to pay particular attention to any memorable detailed sensations -- sights, sounds, smells, whatnot -- of people whom you were intimate with. Sex partners are the absolute most valuable items.</p>

<p>Go back all the way as close to time zero as you can. For most people their first fixed permanent memories are from their third birthday plus/minus six months.  </p>

<p>Go back further. If you were born after the moon landing, meditate on the moon landing. If you were born after the JFK assassination, meditate on the JFK assassination. Just keep meditation focussed on traveling backwards through time. </p>

<p>I do not have a really huge sample on this, maybe 10 people total but every single person that I have discussed this with has had some very spooky thought about actually being another person who was alive before they were born. And experiences like that person drowning, or burning up in a fire, or getting executed for a crime. These <em>memories</em> can be as seemingly authentic as anything from your real life.</p>

<p>Also this is a bit of a tangent but if you know nothing about Crowley and you are interested that book is by far the easiest introduction. They are letters to a correspondent. She was rich and she was stupid and Crowley deliberately paced the content so that anybody who could read could grok the content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I&#39;m super late on this! But I wasn&#39;t able to get into as deep a meditation as I would like to to try this until last night.</p>

<p>I did exactly as described. Went backwards, year by year, through my life, with an emphasis on sexual partners and experiences. I also tried to make sure I focused on the very emotional memories and parts of my life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually going to try this again as soon as I can, to see if I can get anything else because I have no idea if what happened is.. well, relevant or just something my brain did randomly. If that makes any sense.</p>

<p>Anyway.. after doing all of the above.. I &quot;saw&quot; either dust, dirt, or smoke (not sure which) billowing towards me. I didn&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; like I was or had been another person, but it also wasn&#39;t any memory of mine that I can remember.</p>

<p>It actually spooked/shocked me when it happened and I immediately opened my eyes without thinking. Almost as if someone had thrown dirt in my face in real life as I was meditating since I&#39;m <em>far</em> from experienced enough to continue meditating if disturbed.</p>

<p>It was pretty weird because I visualize a lot of things with my eyes closed while meditating, and usually not consciously. But I&#39;ve never had closed-eye visuals snap me out of focus like that before.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m still really intrigued and will be experimenting further.</p>

<p>Sorry it wasn&#39;t something more interesting! </p>

<p>(I&#39;m just going to copy and paste the link to this reply to others who have asked for an update :))</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a hypnosis/ past life regression done a few years back and I can confirm, it was one of the craziest things I’ve ever experienced. It kinda felt like little flashbacks and snippets of my life as I walked backwards in my life. Felt so surreal. At one point it felt like I was imagining things, but my hypnotist actually saw exactly what I saw and described my surroundings perfectly. I could not believe it. 10/10 highly recommend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are several good hypnotists out there that can do past life regression. 
 Their stories (of their patients) are incredible.  The reasons why I believe in more after death are because of, Near Death Experiences (~4-19% of the populous experience them) and Past Life Testimonies (read many past life regression testimonials).  I&#39;ve talked to some elderly who&#39;ve discussed some of their more private moments with me.  They will disclose that they had a near death experience at such and such age from this accident or illness ~ their details are quite vivid and surreal. </p>

<p>Of more recent research though, it seems many are under the idea that our spirits, as they try and leave this realm are being blocked from progressing (either quarantine or malicious intent).  They are given a contract to reincarnate (with no memory of their past life) and to enter the &#39;matrix/prison&#39; again.  The main purpose: to feed (energetically through emotional stimulus?) some thing trapped here.  Seems plausible.</p>

<p>On a side note, some may not like here but, my Wife watches Long Island Medium.  The readings and information she pulls up after talking to the deceased is unbelievable.  The details she can pull up cannot be faked (in my opinion).  She does readings not only to people who make appointments, but as she goes out into the world she can&#39;t help but be around people (shopping, errands etc).  Those people will have deceased relatives/friends who then step forward and request she passes on messages to them, there and now.  Most people are skeptics, but after a few minutes with Theresa they are believers.  I like to note abilities that Theresa can perform: seeing how the person died (feeling their death), bringing up thoughts/acts that the client has said/done (told to her by the deceased) in private word for word, telling us that whenever we think of the deceased they can be present with us, that the deceased can manipulate/materialize light material objects (coins, feathers etc), knowing what objects we keep of the deceased (from mundane like sunglasses, to the obvious jewelry), multiple spirits can be present at once and talk back and forth still in their full personalities (funny, disciplined, awkward), language doesn&#39;t matter (they &#39;speak&#39; differently) etc etc  It&#39;s all pretty consistent from reading to reading.  </p>

If you mean the first one, then can you describe the place you&#39;ve been going? Is it a real place you&#39;ve actually visited in the past, or is it somewhere you&#39;ve only exclusively gone in your dreams? Does it change? Are you still going there?

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an exclusive dream realm. It changes insofar as perhaps the direction I might take to get to certain places but some locations are very static and memorable. I can draw a map. Most interactions are benign but meaningful and rarely do I cone across the same people and when I do it&#39;s usually short lived relationships that lead to more locations that evoke a feeling more than anything. It&#39;s like people are leading me to places and then the places take on a life of their own. But with me in the midst of the familiar chaos. If that makes sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the late reply myself haha, but to give you my answer I honestly don&#39;t know. It could be a number of places. It could simply be a place that your subconscious mind has put together, out of the accumulation of different places it&#39;s seen in the past, as a setting that it thinks is suitable for your conscious mind to go while dreaming. It could be a real city here on earth that you&#39;re going to and that you&#39;re aware of via some psychic phenomena or past life connection. It could be a place that exists, not on this earth, but on a parallel version of it in an alternate reality.<br/>
That&#39;s the best explanation I can offer for you. Sorry it can&#39;t be more, but if you want to share any further details like what this place looks like, the layout, how you feel there etc, things like that might help determine what/where this place is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not a question any of us can help you with, but you already have all the information you need, even if you aren&#39;t aware of it. Your subconscious mind is trying to bring something to your attention, and it uses symbols in dreams to do so. As you said later in the thread, these symbols are very fluid and as such your conscious mind will have trouble. My advice is to find peace and, as backward as it sounds, stop trying to understand it. Sit down with a blank page and write down every little thing that comes to your mind (the map is a good idea), it may or may not be related to your dream. By letting go of what you already know about it, you make room for your subconscious to show you again, this time with maybe more relevant data. Just keep looking within, brother. With patience and peace, you&#39;ll find what you&#39;re looking for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a couple of ghost stories:</p>

<p>1st ghostly experiences was when I was about 4/5-7 in my house in the UK, newish property just under 30 years old.</p>

<p>I would see shadows in the corner of my eye, when I go to look they instantly disappear. (this was the most common thing to happen)</p>

<p>Occasionally I would see a transparent blob and know that&#39;s the ghost.</p>

<p>One day as i went to leave my room I saw my younger brother sitting down on the floor, knees tucked under his chin looking up at me. Except I knew my brother was in the next room getting his nappy changed so I had a strong urged to kick the doppelganger but decided I should actually check just in case. Of course my brother was in the next room so I go back to my room and the impostor is gone.</p>

<p>Multiple poltergeist activity, tidied my room up. But left my full toy box in the middle of the room. When we came back home after a family day out the box had been tipped over and my dad tried telling me it was the wind from the tiny opening of the window. Even I knew that was BS.</p>

<p>The best evidence that proves to myself I wasn&#39;t just imagine these things was when I put a battery on the top step of the stairs as a test before I went down to eat dinner. While my brother and I was eating dinner my mum was hoovering at the bottom of the stairs. Opposite those stairs was the door to the downstairs toilet which was closed. </p>

<p>*BANG* &quot;who threw this!&quot; my mum yelled as she entered the room waving the battery in her hand but as soon as she saw both us her she realised it wasn&#39;t us and looked visibly spooked.</p>

<p>We moved after a few months of that happening. Speaking to my parents recently about that house they both said they didn&#39;t notice anything spooky or odd except that one battery incident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thoughts on michael grubb on youtubes ability to essentially air bend, earth bend, fire bend and water bend if anyone here watched avatar the last airbender on nickolodeon back in the day, this phenomenon is known as hydrokinesis, aerokonesis, pyrokinesis and geokinesis respectively. He seems to be able to make mini leaf tornadoes on some of his videos in locations without wind flowing/turbulence so hes clearly getting energy from somewhere and bending the elements around him, it seems quite limited though and only small things can be done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sort of interested, how are sure he isn’t faking?  Often when I see the little “whirlwinds” blowing leafs around they go for a bit and then stop and then start again when another gust of wind comes... if I were to watch it for a bit and film, I could start filming right when it stopped and pretend to “channel” and when it started again it would seem to be me doing it.  Curious if that may be what is happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s replied heavily to skeptics in his comments though, he also showed james randi is a fraud in one of his comments thats why he never bothered to take the 1 million dollar reward most claim randi will never pay out anyways even if a pile of evidence was presented to him proving the existance of some supernatural concepts. He&#39;s also showed time on and time again places he does this in has no wind period in the climate that day untill he &quot;activates&quot;(pulls the energy from another location with wind I guess?) and suddenly wind will flow around him. He seems honest and legit because most supernatual videos the youtube author will ignore criticism in the comments or flat out disable comments and he&#39;s extremely active with his subscriber base so personally I believe this is a authentic supernatural concept but it doesn&#39;t seem that powerful because a leaf tornado is useless too bad you can&#39;t make fire either for his fire bending to work fire has to already be burning so it seems like it has heavy limitations.</p>

Like I said, I am not merely calling “bullshit” on it, rather, I naturally look for every rational explanation first before considering something like that can be “real”.

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a ghost story from the time I went to Citrix Synergy conference several years ago and stayed at the Linq (previously known as Imperial Palace). I was staying at the hotel and had just gone through an argument with my wife. Upset, slightly depressed, and with my luggage I went to the emergency stairway to relax my mind near the Penthouse (20th floor) somewhere near there. I stayed there for a good hour and noticed there was a cigarette sitting on top of a light switch box near the exit door with the tip barely burnt. I thought it was strange that someone would leave their cigarette unfinished. I got bored and walked to the top floor and saw nothing except a roof opening, curious I jumped up to see a lit room with pipes and nothing more. Next to the opening there was a Bic lighter, I grabbed it and instantly thought, hey I think I can go for a smoke with the cigarette that I last saw somewhere on the 18 floor. I leave my stuff and walked down the stair way about two floors. Looked at the light switch and noticed the cigarette was gone, however the dust that surrounded the cigarette was there. At that moment I had the biggest goose bumps all over my body. So, I thought to myself the cigarette wasn&#39;t mine and said out loudly, This is yours (with the lighter held on my right hand) and placed it where the light switch was near the dust outline of the cigarette. I also made a mental note in my head that if this lighter disappears then for sure there is some paranormal activity. I then proceeded to walked up to the 20th floor and grabbed my luggage and walk back down. The stairway is made out of metal and when you talk the noise is very loud, I know no one else was in the stairway. I got to the 18th floor and noticed the Bic lighter is now missing. At that moment I tried to open the exit door and it was locked and kept walking down the stairway and all the floors doors were locked. It wasn&#39;t until I was on the 12th floor that a security guard opened a door near the 10th. I yelled to hold the door (no reference to GOT) and walked out with the security guard. I told him that I was stuck and couldn&#39;t get out. He advised that all the stairway doors are locked. I told him about my experience and what happened with the missing lighter and cigarette. He gave me a blank stare and said it could happen since the hotel is very old. That evening I started looking up and found there was a man who jumped to his death <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/man-jumps-to-his-death-at-imperial-palace/">https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/man-jumps-to-his-death-at-imperial-palace/</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am surprised that this thread has gotten as far as it has without anyone mentioning the &quot;lawyer for the afterlife,&quot; Victor Zammit, so I will be the first to mention him.  He is a retired lawyer and claims to be an authority on what constitutes evidence, who should be considered a credible source, etc. He is convinced that his favorite sources are credible, of course. He also seems to have witnessed numerous unusual phenomena firsthand.  I used to read his weekly reports, but they get somewhat repetitive. </p>

<p>You may find that he throws sharply contrasting claims into the reports, because he doesn&#39;t feel responsible for making a single monolithic narrative.  Also some of his issues are nuanced, so a monolithic narrative would be more suspect that a narrative with internal tensions.</p>

<p>His afterlife evidence website is at:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly recommend I highly recommend everybody check out this book on the afterlife and paranormal phenomena of astral travel inhabitants of the astral Realm and scenery.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/theastralplane00leaduoft">https://archive.org/details/theastralplane00leaduoft</a></p>

<p>I would also recommend everyone check out the law of one as it pertains heavily to the Incarnative process, the evolution of the Soul where we&#39;re going, where we came from. Basically the  Most Fascinating metaphysical and philosophical subjects are discussed in detail</p>

<p>for just a search on after death in the material I found this 
<a href="https://www.lawofone.info/results.php?q=After+death&amp;amp;st=phrase&amp;amp;qo=&amp;amp;lh=aq&amp;amp;qc=0&amp;amp;s=&amp;amp;c=&amp;amp;fp=0&amp;amp;v=e&amp;amp;l=30&amp;amp;o=r">https://www.lawofone.info/results.php?q=After+death&amp;amp;st=phrase&amp;amp;qo=&amp;amp;lh=aq&amp;amp;qc=0&amp;amp;s=&amp;amp;c=&amp;amp;fp=0&amp;amp;v=e&amp;amp;l=30&amp;amp;o=r</a></p>

<p>also this bit on the stimuli of the ghost process</p>

<p>47.13 Questioner: What stimulus would create what we call an Earth-bound spirit or a lingering ghost?</p>

<p>Ra: I am Ra. The stimulus for this is the faculty of the will. If the will of yellow-ray mind/body/spirit is that which is stronger than the progressive impetus of the physical death towards realization of that which comes, that is, if the will is concentrated enough upon the previous experience, the entity’s shell of yellow ray, though no longer activated, cannot either be completely deactivated and, until the will is released, the mind/body/spirit complex is caught. This often occurs, as we see you are aware, in the case of sudden death as well as in the case of extreme concern for a thing or an other-self.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>everytime I try to write about this stuff something happens and my phone closes or something crazy like that..
I&#39;ve always had a strange relationship with Spirits I thought everybody did.</p>

<p>what people don&#39;t realize is the True Light is the light from within... God is our soul, the light comes from within. </p>

<p>God gives you a soul and the world gives you an ego and you need to Choose Wisely and be a good person, have a relationship with Dad, repent for your sins, help others and be kind and die in your soul not your ego to go to heaven.</p>

<p>we all are blessed with spiritual eyes living and dead we are all energy and we all matter living or dead on Earth we need to open our spiritual eyes and in death we need to open our spiritual eyes or they need to be open when we die to go to heaven</p>

<p>the people or spirits who believe they are lost have their eyes open to the darkness, but have their spiritual eyes closed to The Light Within....
just like we have to close our eyes to meditate just open our spiritual eyes, they have to close their eyes to the darkness and feel the light from within. </p>

<p>I speak to spirits like the apostles because all Spirits matter God does not give up on spirits who are believed to be lost or are in the pit</p>

<p>I give the spirits that leave their lost and in the pit comfort and I try to help them, I try to help them open their spiritual eyes and feel God&#39;s love &amp; let them know that he is not abandoned them..</p>

<p>I love them and I let them know that they still matter &amp; I care.
kind and loving spirits turned me back to God through Steve Huff Spirit Box radio sessions.
I&#39;m not perfect, I&#39;m a sinner, I&#39;m a Child of God I&#39;m not a nun I&#39;m not a saint a human being I do my best to live my life as honestly as possible and to be kind of others..</p>

<p>people have to give ...rich people and poor people have the same thing we all have God and we have enough to give to help each other and that&#39;s what we need to do is to help one another and raise the frequency of the universe and universes and bring peace love and understanding to the world and need to each other...</p>

<p>the more all spirits come together for the greater good living and dead and the more we raise the frequency and we become positive , kind loving caring giving and we help one another the more good things will happen in this world and universe.. It&#39;s like a domino effect...</p>

<p>good things like the North and South Korea peace treaty.. Walmart investing in their workers to give them college educations.... and other wonderful things that are happening in the world</p>

<p>when I felt lost and alone I went to the cemetery and they comforted me so they still have God&#39;s love in their heart, and I believe it was a test for them from God to see how they treated me and to find out if there was still hope and there is there&#39;s always hope as long as we&#39;re live as long as we&#39;re Spirits alive or dead there&#39;s always hope evil spirits and he kind of spirits were all energy and we never die.</p>

<p>they were angry with me at first some of them because I was there because they didn&#39;t understand why I was there and I told them even though I have life I don&#39;t have loved ones I&#39;m alone I don&#39;t have what they have I might have life but I don&#39;t have what they have people that love and miss them and I felt alone and I had nowhere to go and then they understood...</p>

<p>so I came to them to ask for love and kindness and comfort and they gave it to me.</p>

<p>they get upset that when people come to visit they ignore all the other spirits and only focus on their loved ones because sometimes they don&#39;t have loved ones that come to visit them so I go to visit all of them and give them love because they all need it some of them just visit here and some of them are stuck...</p>

<p>and they do still matter just like all energy matters, like all Spirits matter living and dead, we are all brothers and sisters in God and he is our father and we are his children as long as we have a soul we have God we are only in darkness if you choose to be and it&#39;s never too late,there&#39;s always a way back home.
He&#39;s the light within us.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on a mission from God literally I am one half of a twin flame Union
here to raise the frequency of the universe/universes</p>

<p>im here to show &amp; speak and communicate to spirits living &amp; dead about God the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ and remind them that we are all one &amp; they need to start living in their spirit be balanced. In the material world have a relationship with our father repent for their sins try to be good person be kind help others and don&#39;t die in their ego die with their spirit in their spirit so they can go to heaven</p>

<p>God and Spirits know your soul and they will treat you accordingly.</p>

<p>I photograph spirits

<a href="http://i65.tinypic.com/28chxkh.jpg">http://i65.tinypic.com/28chxkh.jpg</a></p>

<p>I speak to them through the Holy Spirit that speaks through me &amp; they speak to me.... telepathy &amp; Resonance of heart chakra is the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>I spent three days in the cemetery 
March 28th right before Easter I don&#39;t believe that is a fluke. God sent me there.</p>

<p>this was on the third day in the mausoleum every day that I left I felt and renewed spirit and immense love, I felt born again...these are the Spirits speaking</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TAxXgYUvHLrWHnAx7N6CjwYp3bSrfbcZ/view?usp=drivesdk">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TAxXgYUvHLrWHnAx7N6CjwYp3bSrfbcZ/view?usp=drivesdk</a></p>

<p>00:46 &quot;say something&quot;
00:48 &quot; we Love you&quot;
00:49 &quot; I Love you&quot;
01:26 &quot;____ Love&#39;s force
01:37 &quot; help me&quot;
.............</p>

<p>then I returned and they weren&#39;t so welcoming in this part of the mausoleum this is like last week but I don&#39;t care dad told me to go 
I think they&#39;re pretty much telling me to get out of there and leave them alone and stuff like that I don&#39;t know maybe if you can make it out listen....
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13jJ52y-LIZfyOjpItP2sXhM-DvUx1ym_/view?usp=drivesdk">https://drive.google.com/file/d/13jJ52y-LIZfyOjpItP2sXhM-DvUx1ym_/view?usp=drivesdk</a></p>

<p>and I played them a song
&quot; Peter Gabriel in your eyes &quot;
youtube it .. with the lyrics</p>

<p>it&#39;s a very spiritual song God is love it starts out love I get to lost sometimes= God I get so lost sometimes.. listen to it</p>

<p>then I told them that people get stuck in there he go and that&#39;s why they go to where they go instead of going to heaven
and then I recorded this I don&#39;t really hear anything on this one and I closed it out with the prayer..</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fO4r_c2KSR-5msq0XfBlABwtThkdUj3K/view?usp=drivesdk">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fO4r_c2KSR-5msq0XfBlABwtThkdUj3K/view?usp=drivesdk</a></p>

<p>and right before I did it , it kinda looks like Jesus is coming out of the wall.

<p>that&#39;s a lot of writing okay I&#39;m done I have a lot more stuff but I&#39;m done
hopefully I don&#39;t get hacked or something</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ive never been a big believer in the normal ghost view.</p>

<p>personally i believe the human mind/soul whatever you want to call the essence of what we are is really just the electrical pattern jumping around in that little biological computer in our heads a pattern that persists somewhat in the planets electrical field or is just reabsorbed by it some time after physical death.</p>

<p>ghosts i think are just echos of these fields, or scars on the large field. when some one dies traumatically i think that pattern just sort of etches itself on the background and sticks around longer than it otherwise would. hauntings are just us picking up on the echo and why most of them are tied to traumatic incidents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen ghosts. Everything in me says ghosts aren&#39;t real except this singular experience, which was extremely vivid and that is remember almost perfectly.</p>

<p>I fell asleep in the lounge of a house my family had recently moved into. I hadn&#39;t fallen asleep anywhere but my room until this night.</p>

<p>When i woke up, I saw 3 ghosts maybe 4. Adults and a child or children. Blueish white. I was very young maybe 7 or 8 and hadn&#39;t really seen many depictions of ghosts but I knew what I was seeing. </p>

<p>They walked past me, stopped, and turned to look at me. They then continue to slowly wade down the hall. I pulled my sleeping bag over my head, in shock and fear. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t feel like I was in danger, just like I had seen something I wasn&#39;t supposed to. The whole experience was just really strange feeling like some kind of really real dream where nothing is different beyond these ghosts. </p>

<p>After about 10 minutes, which felt like an eternity, I ran to bed and shut my door. It doesn&#39;t end there though. I developed an extreme fear of the dark after this although didn&#39;t link it to the ghosts. I couldn&#39;t sleep without a night light and I&#39;d have nightmares if I did.</p>

<p>This is when death started chasing me. This is when the &#39;night terrors&#39; begun. Every night I would enter the dream world and be chased relentlessly by death - a dark robed figure with a shadow for a face. I would scream at the top of my lungs until I couldn&#39;t physically scream anymore - in my sleep. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know anything about the movie trope of &#39;death&#39; with a scythe etc. And my guy(err..) didn&#39;t have a scythe and I didn&#39;t view this character as death at the time... looking back, that&#39;s just the best way to convey it. The whole dream situation felt like nightmare on Elm Street which I also hadn&#39;t seen yet. I&#39;d want to wake up so badly but couldn&#39;t do it. I never let death catch me, and that required doing some crazy and scary stuff like climbing cliff faces or swimming through tunnels holding my breath or crawling through barbed wire. I sometimes wondered what would happen if I stopped running and let &#39;it&#39; get me.</p>

<p>This went on for months. I used to hear a ticking in the wall. It sounded like a watch, always consistent, always the same place etc. The house also wasn&#39;t earthed properly and you&#39;d get shocks off the tap in wet weather. We found out years later it was built on old tribal burial grounds. Don&#39;t really know if that&#39;s related but thought more details can&#39;t hurt. </p>

<p>Everything about that place was fucking weird when I look back on it. Me and my siblings all almost died there. Caught fire with fuel. Falling through big windows. Coming off skateboard down steep drive getting knocked out and almost hit by car plus heaps of other shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lived with a ghost for 15 years ish.
My parents down sized when they became elderly and made friends with a couple next door. This went on for a while and I got to know them well too. Eventually years passed and the elderly neighbours moved into a care home. My parents needed more care so I bought the house next door and moved in.
The man who owned it ( Eric ) had made a beautiful garden and often visited and gardened for us , growing veggies and pruning the roses etc and we all remained friends for some time.
Anyway ....I hadn&#39;t seen him for a while but came down one morning for breakfast and saw him out in the garden digging, so I made him his cuppa and went out, but couldn&#39;t find him. The next morning to my shock I saw him stood in my kitchen at about 6am , as I walked up behind him he faded away and vanished. There was an angry feeling and something like wind and the heavy wooden kitchen door flew open and then banged shut.
I went round next door to mums a bit shaken up where - you guessed it - she told me he had died two nights ago and she hadn&#39;t seen me to tell me.
Since then I saw him in the garden through the kitchen or bedroom window several times.Sometimes the door opened and closed, often loudly ,without explanation and our messy muddied shoes were sometimes cleaned and tidied outside the garden door. Things around the garden moved .Others saw him too , from a distance in the garden and my husband once on the stairs at night. We didn&#39;t mind , he was a friend in life and a genuinely nice man and a non scary ghost .Eventually mum and dad died and we moved on. ...and didn&#39;t tell the new buyers about the lodger.
I have never really talked about him outside of the family , who all experienced it with us anyway, it all seems a bit clinched and dull .But it is true non the less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve often wondered: Why do ghosts appear to wear clothes? Specifically, they appear to wear the clothes they were presumably buried in. Further, they almost always wear <em>modern</em> clothes, or in the case of legendary ghosts maybe Victorian era clothes, but you almost never hear of ghosts wearing loincloths or nude or animal skins even though logic dictates that most ghosts would be from people that lived hundreds if not thousands of years ago simply because most dead people are from hundreds or thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>Not only that, but more dead people from hundreds or thousands of years ago would be dead from brutal/unjust causes simply because life was more brutal and unjust in the past. Therefore if the ghost is tied to this plane because of some injustice, you would would think it would be more statistically likely that it would be a caveman ghost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me and a friend were quite out of it once (let&#39;s say we were just taking alcohol..) and we were chilling in the dark, in my living room, listening to music. I saw a wash of blue-ish purple (may have been a little red glow at the core?) suddenly and I felt another presence in my consciousness. I let it take over for a bit, sensing that it wasn&#39;t harmful or anything but more out of curiousity than anything. It thought that the music wasn&#39;t bad, pretty dope (listening to XXXtentatcion) and bopped along to it for a few beats before leaving my body, passing straight through my friend&#39;s body, and out the balcony glass door. I looked at my friend straight away and he shivered as he shook it off. I asked him if he saw what I saw. He says &quot;what?&quot; I say &quot;Did you see the same thing I just saw? What colour was it?&quot;</p>

<p>He tells me it was blue.
I ask him which way it went.
He points out the balcony window.</p>

<p>Scariest shit I&#39;ve ever encountered. Also, I can&#39;t say for sure, but when it was inside me I felt like it was a tortured soul, and I had a slim feeling it was just the tortured part of XXXtentacion&#39;s soul. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t even listen to him much anymore - but that&#39;s as much fucking proof I need of spirits or ghosts existing in the world I think.</p>

It takes a bit for certain concepts to take shape, but when they do its super exciting to understand something that before i was struggling to even get started on the very very basics.

Socially im super isolated at the moment, but it actually doesnt bother me now.</p>

<p>I wasnt an idiot before, but i really wasnt all that smart. And up until now i didnt realize that this new found laserlike focus kinda started happening after i died.

    <div class="md"><p>The secrets of the forever time...or something like that. Its on youtube. Theres a lot of episodes and dude def is way too windy and repetitive. I would have turned it off for sure except at the time I was in bed and couldn&#39;t find my remote and was like fuck it...while the messenger himself can be a little annoying at times Im so glad I didn&#39;t end up turning it off. The idea behind it is pretty interesting, imo, especially if you are interested in anything like that. Theres so many good books you can find online for free. Im kinda partial because back in the day the author was one of my college professors in a death and dying course but the book, &quot;life after life&quot; is good too just to get a kinda overview and general idea of some different aspects of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I met him in Gettysburg at the first ghost convention, that other couple, the lady that always carried around this doll, whom husband murdered her were they&#39;re too. I also got a reading from Tiffany and Chip Coffey. They were the real deal, it was fun but he did say the same thing to me. He seemed a bit disconnected to this world and bored about the information that he has learned, I suspect because he says the same thing over and over.</p>
