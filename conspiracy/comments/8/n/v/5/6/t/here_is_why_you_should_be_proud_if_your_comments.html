    <div class="md"><p>Sounds more like fascism. &quot;Rule by a totalitarian and corporatist government&quot; is how Wikipedia describes it. 
Establishing global trade routes could be deemed &quot;globalist policy&quot;. Is there anything inherently wrong with global trade? From what I see Corporatism is the issue you describe.
You think its impossible to be a nationlist and also a corporatist plutocracy?  What about China? Japan? Israel? What we have is a fascist, corporatist plutocracy! Say it with me!</p>

<p>Only if you like euphemisms. Circumventing democratic processes via legalized bribery otherwise known campaign contributions is &quot;globalist policy.&quot; Oligopolizing the MSM in order to created an unprecedented propaganda machine is &quot;globalist policy.&quot; Lowering production costs by exploiting third world poverty is &quot;globalist policy.&quot; Promoting illegal immigration with the intention of decimating the middle class is &quot;globalist policy.&quot; </p>

<p>Corporations are the organizations that the globalists hide behind while they loot our economies. The Sacklers didn&#39;t get you hooked on smack, it was Purdue Pharma. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t see how blaming &quot;globalism&quot; is useful whatsoever. Lowering production costs and exportig labor is capitalist policy. Promoting illegal immigration? Who does this? Promoting legal immigration, that&#39;s leftist policy. Using the MSM as propaganda is a CIA policy. Be specific and use correct language, &quot;globalist&quot; shouldn&#39;t be used as a catch all for everything, it just makes it more difficult to hold anyone accountable. To clarify I agree with your position I just dont like the terminology. What we used to call the &quot;corporations&quot; and the &quot;bankers&quot; we now call the &quot;globalists&quot;..  its just so easy for that term to be manipulated by the media into meaning whatever they want.</p>

<p>I agree but I doubt you&#39;ll ever get the teevee to call it what it is; state supported crony capitalism. </p>

<p>Correct and the US government used to protect its citizens against this with tariffs. The most prosperous decades in for the US middle and lower classes were the result of these policies. </p>

<p>Do you not have a teevee?</p>

<p>You might want to look into who manages the MSM conglomerates.  </p>

<p>Like i said, corporations and bankers are just the tools of the globalists. Call them what you please, their tactics have become obvious as have their objectives. </p>

<p>Thanks to Guccifer the Shadowbroker hacking the shit out of Mossfon, now we know, we always suspected, at least 10% of GLOBAL GDP is hidden in offshore havens, which should be the biggest most shocking crime in history.</p>

<p>Globalism steals from local economies to slowly bankrupt entire regions and make them unable to provide for their own people much less mount any defense against the Globalist Oligarchs.</p>

<p>By bleeding out local communities, the Globalists prevent any meaningful Nationalist or Populist movements from forming, because none of them will ever have enough money to match the billions that George Soros dumps around the world to prop up his rotten empire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. The truth is sacred in our day in age. Most of the time it’s painful when you discover it. Nobody wants to believe that the entire system is a sham.. nobody wants to believe that our own government would harm it’s own citizens. .. nobody wants to accept that in reality, we live in a fascist nation.</p>

<p>8/pol/ had some very good advice about dealing with the paid shills, the JTRIG chair force, the Brock Bots, the Soros Socks, the Shitlib Volunteer Brownshirt Censor Brigade 451, and it&#39;s this:</p>

<p>im_not_locked_in_here_with_you_youre_locked_in_here_with_me.gif</p>

<p>Don&#39;t think of it as being unfairly censored. Think of it as an <em>OPPORTUNITY</em> to drop Redpills on the shills and slowly demoralize them with their own Cognitive Dissonance fired back at them to eventually <em>CONVERT</em> them to /ourguys/.</p>

<p>tbh I&#39;m not posting here for Normies to read at all, although if you&#39;re a Normie and you like anything i may post tgat&#39;s an ancillary bonus--I&#39;m only here to bullycide the shills.</p>

<p>I say a lot of dumb shit but I&#39;m at a 10000 karma per year arc and that works for me. Bring on the downvotes!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post is how I interpret the downvotes when I am thinking optimistically. Thank you for cementing that possibility. The other possibility, that the world is filled with actual morons, is utterly disheartening. Keep up the hard work, the world IS shifting. 👊</p>
