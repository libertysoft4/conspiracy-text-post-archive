    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the &quot;North Korea threat&quot; was manufactured. I&#39;m open to a lot but in the case of North Korea I think their &quot;executive branch&quot; is fucking crazy.</p>

<p>To be honest, I think Western governments pull a lot of strings but they are baffled on how to handle North Korea because they never know what to expect.</p>

<p>Its the inmates running the asylum over there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I agree... see, North Korea IS constantly swinging wildly between &#39;EXTREME THREAT&#39; and &#39;BFD&#39; depending on Kim Jung&#39;s mood that week.</p>

<p>However, what we get fed via the media has very, very little to do with that.  When and if a scare is needed, Kim is one of the cards they can pull to the top of the deck and say &quot;SEE?!?  This guy is STILL HERE!  You forgot about him because you were freaked out about the Swine Flu and Iran and Israel and the American Idol finale and Jon &amp; Kate + 8 breaking up.. etc... but NOW IS THE TIME TO GET SCARED OF THIS AGAIN.</p>

<p>Then when we&#39;re tired of that we&#39;ll bounce you to something else.</p>

<p>Just because they are holding up someone as a boogie man to keep people paralyzed with fear doesn&#39;t mean that person doesn&#39;t have some REAL threat potential... or DID at one time. In fact it works much better if they DO.</p>

<p>Besides, who REALLY knows what the hell is going on in North Korea.  With a total media blackout like that it&#39;s pretty easy for anybody, anywhere to manufacture reality.</p>

The best thing I found to &quot;insider&quot; pics of North Korea comes from this Russian <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;js=n&amp;amp;u=http://www.tema.ru/travel/north-korea-1/&amp;amp;sl=ru&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;history_state0=">website</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>If the news wasn&#39;t reporting on Swine Flu or North Korea&#39;s threat, the conspiracy reddit would be filled with accusations that the media is trying to cover up something/that we aren&#39;t being informed.

<p>Just of of curiosity, I seem to always see posts by you, and you have 15,000 karma. What&#39;s your strategy, and how much time do you spend on reddit? Do you have a real job, how old are you, and where do you live? Sorry, I know this is kinda off topic, but outside of karmanaut I seem to notice you on here the most. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about the US, swine flu might be disapearin from the headlines there, but then again its not flu season in the northern hemisphere. </p>

<p>Here in  Australia the number of confirmed cases doubled today. We are heading into swine flu and the health officials are predicting between 10-30% of Australians will catch swine flu this season. When you have that quantity of people being effected even just a <em>slightly</em> higher mortality rate is worth being worried about. </p>

<p>If 1% of those people die, it will be tens of thousands of people, a national emergency. </p>

<p>Just wait until autumn/winter, swine flu will hit the news again in the US, in a big way. </p>

<p>There were news articles recently about the Peak Oil coming by next year again, so that&#39;s why I mentioned it.  Just like last time when all the articles in the news were mainly about the Peak Oil is coming and that it is here a year or two ago.</p>

New stories have a week or two maximum if it doesn&#39;t escalate or nothing else happens.  When WHO rates something at possible pandemic levels that is reason to pay attention.  I&#39;m not saying it wasn&#39;t over hyped, but that&#39;s what the news does now, it&#39;s infotainment (That word is actually in this spell check.  wow.)  It may be hyped, but a new mutated virus and an atomic bomb being detonated are things I like to know about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re still just missing the entire point in a shockingly spectacular way. </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually starting to feel a little bad, like I&#39;m kicking someone when they&#39;re down.</p>

<p>Hey.. look... if you want to spend the whole year freaking the fuck out about the fact that some people will catch the flu later this year, knock yourself out.  lmao.</p>

<p>People get the flu and die from it every year.  Far more people die from other causes daily that nobody ever gives two shits about, much less having it discussed ad nauseum in the media.</p>

<p>Referring vaguely to &#39;figures&#39; put out by &#39;national health officials&#39; and &#39;independent medical organisations.&#39;  It&#39;s so clear to me that you are the kind of person who isn&#39;t happy until everyone you come into contact with believes 100% what you believe and is equally as scared as you about life in general.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like you have a disdain for me because I refuse to be cowed and terrified by &#39;figures&#39; I read that were put out by &#39;national health officials&#39; and which were <em>gulp</em> CONFIRMED by &#39;independent medical organisations.&#39;</p>

<p>I have some scary news for you.</p>

<p>I just read that 100% of Australians will die from a deep space impact later this year.  I know it will happen because I saw the figures put out by national defense officials and it was CONFIRMED by independent astronomical organisations.  Sorry, Oz. :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>listen, I don&#39;t just blindly trust in some unknown future. People I know have started getting it, thats when it moves from abstract fear campaign to real world concern. I am not freaking out about it, I am just taking preventative measures. </p>

<p>You can not distrust every single organisation, and while you can&#39;t blindly trust the government, you can watch their actions to ascertain the nature of the situation. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve set up containment wards in every hospital, they&#39;ve bought massive quantities of antivirals and they are quarantining every ship and scanning every passenger. These things cost huge amounts of money, and I have never seen them do anything like it in my lifetime, nor have i heard of anything like it in my parents life times. They didn&#39;t set up containment wards for SARS, they didn&#39;t quarantine <em>everyone</em> for avian influenza. </p>

<p>All of these things tell me they are more worried about it than they are letting on. They aren&#39;t screaming panic from the rooftops, but they are preparing our defences. Which leads me to do the same thing. </p>

<p>Just who or what <em>do</em> you trust?</p>

<p>I guess the fact that swine exist and are eaten, treated like pets by some folks doesn&#39;t offend them.  But naming a disease correctly according to it&#39;s origin is offensive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go away, little boy, you&#39;re annoying the adults.</p>

<p>But since you&#39;re still here, <em>this</em> is why I will not discourse with you or Herk.</p>

<p>A new study out of Yale University confirms what argumentative liberals have long-known: Offering reality-based rebuttals to conservative lies only makes conservatives cling to those lies even harder. In essence, schooling conservatives makes them more stupid. From the Washington Post article on the study, which came out yesterday:</p>

<pre><code>Political scientists Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler provided two groups of volunteers with the Bush administration&#39;s prewar claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. One group was given a refutation -- the comprehensive 2004 Duelfer report that concluded that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction before the United States invaded in 2003. Thirty-four percent of conservatives told only about the Bush administration&#39;s claims thought Iraq had hidden or destroyed its weapons before the U.S. invasion, but 64 percent of conservatives who heard both claim and refutation thought that Iraq really did have the weapons. The refutation, in other words, made the misinformation worse.

A similar &quot;backfire effect&quot; also influenced conservatives told about Bush administration assertions that tax cuts increase federal revenue. One group was offered a refutation by prominent economists that included current and former Bush administration officials. About 35 percent of conservatives told about the Bush claim believed it; 67 percent of those provided with both assertion and refutation believed that tax cuts increase revenue.

In a paper approaching publication, Nyhan, a PhD student at Duke University, and Reifler, at Georgia State University, suggest that Republicans might be especially prone to the backfire effect because conservatives may have more rigid views than liberals: Upon hearing a refutation, conservatives might &quot;argue back&quot; against the refutation in their minds, thereby strengthening their belief in the misinformation. Nyhan and Reifler did not see the same &quot;backfire effect&quot; when liberals were given misinformation and a refutation about the Bush administration&#39;s stance on stem cell research.
</code></pre>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever gotten in an argument with your conservative friends (assuming you haven&#39;t offered each other a mutual Carville-Matalin-style political ceasefire to preserve the friendship), you&#39;ve probably seen this &quot;backfire effect&quot; in action. The more you try to tell people that Sarah Palin is lying when she says she was against the Bridge to Nowhere, the more they believe she was telling the truth. The more you try to explain how similar McCain&#39;s policies are to Bush&#39;s, the more they maintain he&#39;s &quot;the original maverick.&quot;</p>

<p>The typical mantra of the left is that we don&#39;t need to sink to the Republicans&#39; level because we have the truth on our side. But if the other side is utterly immune to the truth -- and indeed, the truth only makes them dig deeper into their fantasy world in which the economy is fundamentally strong and the War in Iraq is a staggering success -- what&#39;s a leftie to do?</p>

<p>I ain&#39;t got the answers, ace, except to say this: When arguing with conservatives in front of on-the-fence independents, remember that you&#39;re not trying to convince the conservative to actually buy into silly notions like facts and reason. You&#39;re highlighting the differences between left and right for the outside observer. If the other guy insists on political views that belong only in Disney World&#39;s Fantasyland, other folks will realize what&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>But if there is no third party, do yourself a favor and save your breath. As the study demonstrates, you&#39;re only making matters worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but at least with American vernacular the term &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; is synonymous with &quot;anti-Jew&quot;. Those who are anti-Arab are generally referred to as &quot;Islamophobes&quot;. And yes, I know that there are Arab Jews and Christians and Zoroastrians and Scientologists. I&#39;m also well aware that there are quite a few non-Arab Muslims. </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually starting to feel a little bad, like I&#39;m kicking someone when they&#39;re down.</p>

<p>Hey.. look... if you want to spend the whole year freaking the fuck out about the fact that some people will catch the flu later this year, knock yourself out.  lmao.</p>

<p>People get the flu and die from it every year.  Far more people die from other causes daily that nobody ever gives two shits about, much less having it discussed ad nauseum in the media.</p>

<p>Referring vaguely to &#39;figures&#39; put out by &#39;national health officials&#39; and &#39;independent medical organisations.&#39;  It&#39;s so clear to me that you are the kind of person who isn&#39;t happy until everyone you come into contact with believes 100% what you believe and is equally as scared as you about life in general.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like you have a disdain for me because I refuse to be cowed and terrified by &#39;figures&#39; I read that were put out by &#39;national health officials&#39; and which were <em>gulp</em> CONFIRMED by &#39;independent medical organisations.&#39;</p>

<p>I have some scary news for you.</p>

<p>I just read that 100% of Australians will die from a deep space impact later this year.  I know it will happen because I saw the figures put out by national defense officials and it was CONFIRMED by independent astronomical organisations.  Sorry, Oz. :(</p>
