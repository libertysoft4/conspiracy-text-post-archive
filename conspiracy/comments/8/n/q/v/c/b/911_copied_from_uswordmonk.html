        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 men armed with boxcutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily-defended airspace in the world, overpowering the passengers and the military combat-trained pilots on 4 commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor.</p>

<p>These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn’t handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced “missing” from the Pentagon’s coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001.</p>

<p>Luckily, the news anchors knew who did it within minutes, the pundits knew within hours, the Administration knew within the day, and the evidence literally fell into the FBI’s lap. But for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on American soil in history.</p>

<p>The investigation was delayed, underfunded, set up to fail, a conflict of interest and a cover up from start to finish. It was based on testimony extracted through torture, the records of which were destroyed. It failed to mention the existence of WTC7, Able Danger, Ptech, Sibel Edmonds, OBL and the CIA, and the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening. It was lied to by the Pentagon, the CIA, the Bush Administration and as for Bush and Cheney…well, no one knows what they told it because they testified in secret, off the record, not under oath and behind closed doors. It didn’t bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is of “little practical significance“. Still, the 9/11 Commission did brilliantly, answering all of the questions the public had (except most of the victims’ family members’ questions) and pinned blame on all the people responsible (although no one so much as lost their job), determining the attacks were “a failure of imagination” because “I don’t think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ” except the Pentagon and FEMA and NORAD and the NRO.</p>

<p>The DIA destroyed 2.5 TB of data on Able Danger, but that’s OK because it probably wasn’t important.</p>

<p>The SEC destroyed their records on the investigation into the insider trading before the attacks, but that’s OK because destroying the records of the largest investigation in SEC history is just part of routine record keeping.</p>

<p>NIST has classified the data that they used for their model of WTC7’s collapse, but that’s OK because knowing how they made their model of that collapse would “jeopardize public safety“.</p>

<p>The FBI has argued that all material related to their investigation of 9/11 should be kept secret from the public, but that’s OK because the FBI probably has nothing to hide.</p>

<p>Osama Bin Laden lived in a cave fortress in the hills of Afghanistan, but somehow got away. Then he was hiding out in Tora Bora but somehow got away. Then he lived in Abottabad for years, taunting the most comprehensive intelligence dragnet employing the most sophisticated technology in the history of the world for 10 years, releasing video after video with complete impunity (and getting younger and younger as he did so), before finally being found in a daring SEAL team raid which wasn’t recorded on video, in which he didn’t resist or use his wife as a human shield, and in which these crack special forces operatives panicked and killed this unarmed man, supposedly the best source of intelligence about those dastardly terrorists on the planet. Then they dumped his body in the ocean before telling anyone about it. Then a couple dozen of that team’s members died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>This is the story of 9/11, brought to you by the media which told you the hard truths about JFK and incubator babies and mobile production facilities and the rescue of Jessica Lynch.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this story…you are a batshit, paranoid, tinfoil, dog-abusing baby-hater and will be reviled by everyone. If you love your country and/or freedom, happiness, rainbows, rock and roll, puppy dogs, apple pie and your grandma, you will never ever express doubts about any part of this story to anyone. Ever.</p>

<p>This has been a public service announcement by: the Friends of the FBI, CIA, NSA, DIA, SEC, MSM, White House, NIST, and the 9/11 Commission. Because Ignorance is Strength.</p>

<p>I still scratch my head to this day, as to why they even bothered including this. </p>

<p>What does his dialysis have to do with his the capability of telling people what to do? </p>

<p>Why does a satellite phone, laptop or his location make 9/11 more difficult or unbelievable? </p>

<p>Why would you oppose a madman in a confined space armed with a knife - Yes, boxcutters are knives. When hijackings typically involved survival? </p>

<p>What&#39;s so sophisticated about hijacking a plane? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny wag, conversation was in 2002. He did tell me about this however.</p>

<p>Commercial pilots are trained to squawk a universal hijack code (7500) if they are subject to an attempted hijacking, thereby notifying FAA controllers on the ground. The fact is that not one of the eight pilots (4 Pilots and 4 Co Pilots) on the four hijacked planes performed this action.</p>

<p>“To communicate to air traffic control that an aircraft is being hijacked, a pilot under duress should squawk 7500 or vocally, by radio communication, transmit “(Aircraft callsign); Transponder seven five zero zero.”</p>

<p>The location of the Mode A panel is common knowledge, and emergency squawks are even more common knowledge.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible the hijackers moved fast enough to prevent 7500 being set.</p>

<p>The setting of 7500 is a very serious step, if the door was opened and trouble detected, it&#39;s reasonable to imagine that the first thought of the crew was to see what&#39;s happening rather than squawk straight away.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to tell you about the rest of this, but I work in dialysis. Sure, many of them would be fully capable of telling others what to do but if you are on dialysis you can&#39;t get far from that machine for a long period of time. You go more than a few days without running and you have to go the hospital because you can&#39;t breathe. You have to have special chemicals to cleanse the blood and specifically purified water to use. Not to mention the medications you have to take on top of that. This would be difficult to pull of hidden in a cave with no trace of your whereabouts.</p>

I mean, just look at his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lazar">Wikipedia page</a>. Count how many times on there they talk about there being no records of him attending the schools he claimed to hold degrees from (MIT being one of them). Are you trying to tell me that this guy <em>didn&#39;t</em> go to any schooling, but was somehow still qualified enough to be contracted with NASA, and expose Area 51 to the public?</p>

<p>Or how about this one!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lazar claims to have worked as a scientist &quot;in the Meson Physics facility&quot; at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. His name does appear in a Los Alamos National Lab telephone directory; however, this lists both employees and contractors, and Stanton Friedman claims that he actually worked as a technician for Kirk Meyer, an outside contractor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...ok? So he did work at least WITH them. Why phrase it to make it seem like he&#39;s lying about that too?</p>

<p>Also, why is this Youtuber &quot;Jim Piver&quot; spamming this comment all over that comment section? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>3/28/18  -- - Roswell, New Mexico - - - - - -  We visited the International UFO Museum here. Not a single mention of Bob Lazar. Not a word. There were pictures of, and information about Stanton Friedman, but nothing of Lazar, a man who claims to have reverse-engineered UFOs. - - - -  Lazar is a pathological liar.

</blockquote>

<p>Uhh yea, if anything that would tell me he&#39;s probably MORE LIKELY to be legit, when the fucking &quot;International UFO Museum&quot; won&#39;t mention him. It&#39;s not like they are the pinnacle of only using highly credible and well vetted sources, lol amirite?</p>

<p>And you&#39;re not supposed to be stock into it. It&#39;s a guess based on memory. Improbable isn&#39;t the same as impossible, but what are we talking about anyway? A plane apparently hit the pentagon? And clearly isolated the damage to one area? The floors immediately beside and behind had fire damage but little else.

That would suggest to me, in turn, that the pilot wasn&#39;t new, he wasn&#39;t some random guy who recently learned how to fly a single engine prop plane. He was a pilot that knew his aircraft very well and knew the limits and how to handle it and probably wasn&#39;t sitting in the cockpit physically.</p>

<p>Compare the aircraft weights, which at first I would have personally guessed, a Cesna vs a 747, to be 1:10 in weight. I was completely wrong.</p>

<p>A 747 weighs roughly 404,000 pounds. Compare that to a F-15, which is also giant, ~54,000 pounds fully loaded. These are HUGE aircraft!! Heavy American jets.</p>

<p>A cesna weighs 1,600 pounds. Lighter than most cars!!!</p>

<p>Their flight characteristics are NOTHING alike!! Not to mention the speed differences. 100 mph vs 500 mph.</p>

<p>This is an example of Americans failing to think critically for themselves, blindly believing what the TV says because the alternate would mean claiming responsibility and acknowledging there is a BIG lie going on(the rest of the world didn&#39;t fall victim to this and thought Americans were insane). Make the lie big and keep repeating it - Hitler or Goebbels said something like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just gonna put this out there... architects are not trained in thermodynamics. Or compounding failures.</p>

<p>To his credit, the tower <em>did</em> survive an aircraft collision. The architect however did not anticipate how cheap insulation around the steel members could be blown off by the explosion, nor how burning jet fuel could weaken the supporting columns. In addition, no one had ever built a tower like this before, so a lot of the safety assessment came from calculations. Calculations run 3 years before we landed on the moon. From an era with much smaller passenger planes.</p>

<p>Does this piece of evidence only seem reliable when paired with everything else? Or can a building-artist from the 60s prove with mathematical rigor that an untested structural column design can survive every single event resulting from a collision with a commercial airliner 40 years in the future, with no mistakes?</p>

    <div class="md"><ol>
<li>It really doesn&#39;t. This is going to be the third time I have to say this: there is NO RECORD of any crash analysis on the WTC towers. There is a single memo that claims the analysis was performed. The <del>architect</del> structural engineer claims he performed the calculations. NO ONE ELSE on his staff even recalls seeing anything like the calculations: <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/wtc_707_impact.html">http://www.911myths.com/html/wtc_707_impact.html</a></li>
</ol>

<p>1.A: Even if we could verify his calculations with modern methods (which we can&#39;t, seeing as he &quot;lost&quot; his calculations), he explicitly stated he did an analysis for an <em>emergency</em> <em>landing</em> in <em>low</em> <em>visibility</em>. That meant low speeds and minimum fuel. If the plane had more fuel, ATC would have redirected it to an airport with better visibility.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=progressive+collapse">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=progressive+collapse</a>. A progressive collapse is called progressive because it means one element&#39;s failure causes the next element&#39;s failure. This is a very fast process.</li>
</ol>

<p>2.A: Stop thinking that common sense is all you need to understand building demolition. You can&#39;t &quot;speed up&quot; or &quot;slow down&quot; a collapse.  When the top levels of a building start pancaking down, those beams aren&#39;t going to hold for dramatic effect, they just <em>break</em> instantly. After the first layer, the loss of momentum is marginal. </p>

<p>BONUS ROUND: that link you sent is full of lies, here&#39;s a highlight reel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both technical calculations and testimony from WTC structural engineers confirm that the Twin Towers were built to withstand the impact from the passenger jets that hit them on 9/11.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>The lead structural engineer was unable to produce the calculations he used.</li>
<li>Calculations do not confirm whether something happened. They can confirm the design matches building codes and engineering guidelines, but that&#39;s a step away from saying the codes were sufficient.</li>
<li>Designed to withstand =/= built to withstand. See Citigroup Center for more on how contractors can nearly cause catastrophe by not following design.</li>
<li>Again, low-fuel, low-speed 707 =/= high-speed 767. The only reason high-speed ever comes up is because of the PANYNJ white paper (readable here at page 305 <a href="https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101012">https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101012</a>). Robertson continues to deny that his calculations ever went above 200 mph. It would appear 600 mph was an exaggeration by the Port Authority.</li>
<li>Despite most of this sentence being wrong, it still doesn&#39;t say anything meaningful because the towers <em>did</em> survive being hit by the planes. The cause of collapse was weakened steel beams from burning jet fuel and lack of insulation over the beams, a compound issue that structural engineers had never considered before.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>In designing the towers to withstand the impact of a Boeing 707, the designers would have assumed that the aircraft was operated normally. So they would have assumed that the aircraft was traveling at its cruise speed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They would not have assumed, and they did not assume. They assumed a low speed collision with low fuel.</p>

<p>Gonna skip over the napkin math on energy distribution. Long story short, you can&#39;t do structural analysis of an airplane crash on a single sheet of paper and expect it to match reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is well within limits that the towers were built to survive. So why did the North tower fall? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except it didn&#39;t. Again, the towers survive the plane crashes, have their supports weakened by high temperatures, then buckle and pancake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We looked at every possible thing we could think of that could happen to the buildings, even to the extent of an airplane hitting the side… Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed. [But] the building structure would still be there.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the most part he&#39;s right. There was a horrendous fire, and the structure survived the impact. What he didn&#39;t consider was the loss of steel insulation in the explosion and the weakening of the support structure from elevated temperatures. An engineer from 40 years ago makes a mistake. It happens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2001, Leslie Robertson, a WTC structural engineer who worked as a subordinate to Skilling, claimed that the Twin Towers were only able to withstand the impact of jet airplanes going no faster than 180 mph. However, not only are these statements contradicted by the design test results...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re contradicted by a 3-page white paper put out by the Port Authority. We don&#39;t know the results because, again, Robertson has no record of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...they also contradict statements made by Robertson in 1984/1985, when he said that there was “little likelihood of a collapse no matter how the building was attacked.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An easy thing to say when you don&#39;t consider compounding engineering issues. Just because the engineer said it&#39;s safe doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s safe. That&#39;s why there was an investigation, so we could find out why it happened.</p>

<p>“Who would design these buildings for jet plane impacts but not fuel fires?”</p>

<p>Engineers with little-to-no experience in plane-building collisions and who don&#39;t consider steel insulation to be removeable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not only were the towers designed to survive crashes of large jet aircraft, but they were designed to potentially survive multiple plane crashes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh. It&#39;s almost like the authors of this page ignored the report and chose their own version of events to dispute, where 767s make skyscrapers fall down like dominoes. Repetition does not make it true: the WTC was not brought down by collision forces, but by weakening support columns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This assertion is supported by Frank A. Demartini, the on-site construction manager for the World Trade Center, who said on January 25, 2001:</p>

<p>“The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it. That was the largest plane at the time. I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door—this intense grid—and the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting. It really does nothing to the screen netting.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As fun as it is to interview people who built something and hear them gush about how strong it is, he&#39;s probably right. If structural weakening of exposed support columns wasn&#39;t an issue, then the building might have been able to take multiple hits. But that&#39;s not what we&#39;re discussing anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition, investigators from NIST who examined the destruction of the WTC skyscrapers told The New York Times in 2007 that newly disclosed documents from the 1960s show that the new York Port Authority, the original owners of Twin Towers, also considered aircraft moving at 600 mph,slightly faster and therefore more destructive than the ones that did hit the towers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you get my point on both of these problems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The WTC designers seemed to be correct in their analysis in the 1960s, and the evidence that these buildings were brought down by controlled demolition corroborates their conclusions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one is stupid enough to give me a headache. If you&#39;re arguing that something didn&#39;t happen, that&#39;s not arguing something couldn&#39;t happen. You can&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; someone&#39;s calculations are correct by giving evidence that something else happened.</p>

<p>I still think its a great source I presented. Some of your counter points are OK, thanks for sharing. It would be cool if you could provide your general feeling about the entirety of the events that happened that day, for example the destruction of World Trade Center 7 and the plane hitting the pentagon. I am just curious but do you also find these events as not suspect in any way as decribed by the press? Thanks.</p>

<li>That video is no substitute for hundreds of pages of calculations. I don&#39;t believe that the engineers lied about doing a crash analysis, but I think they would have done one that wouldn&#39;t hold up to scrutiny. For example, Mr. Demartini&#39;s observation does not cover sustained fires around uninsulated steel, only the physical impact of the plane. I will also continue to say that an engineering calculation done by hand in the 60s is fully capable of being wrong.</li>
</ol>

<p>2A. A progressive collapse would start wherever the first failure occurred, and as I understand it most demolition occurs nears the base of a structure to be demolished.</p>

<p>My &quot;general feeling&quot; is that American psychology wasn&#39;t prepared for 9/11. No American had ever seen his home country attacked, nor their parents or grandparents. The idea that it was not only possible to cause horrific mass murder, but to have it coordinated from a cave in Afghanistan by a group so dedicated to their leader they were willing to die for him, is intolerable. Americans have always had something like vengeance in our blood, which has propelled us into many wars, in search of the attackers who &quot;started it&quot;, seemingly unfairly. For many people, it&#39;s much easier to attack an existing villain at home, one who &quot;broke the rules&quot; or &quot;played unfairly&quot; rather than come to terms with their weakness as a society. Every conspiracy theory is rooted in the incredible power of The Authority: a malevolent force that is somehow without flaw.</p>

<p>The events of 9/11 are, in my mind, barely knowable. So much happened that had never happened before, which raised many more questions than we had evidence to answer. It would be impractical, for example, to reconstruct the Twin Towers and fly another plane into them, this time with strain gauges on every steel beam, thermometers on every floor, cameras recording every detail. But this is the <em>only</em> <em>way</em> some people will accept a version of events. Because they will find discrepancy between reality and The Authority, and trust that The Authority was correct.</p>

<p>The truth is we can only find the most likely series of events, given an incomplete picture. There has never been an exception to this rule in the history of mankind, save for certain religious events.</p>

<p>In short, I would ask you to investigate something else. Anything else. Do it with the same fervor, the same high standards, the same distrust in The Government and faith in The Authority as you have for 9/11. Maybe look at the Radisson hotel walkway collapse. You find out how easy it is to weave conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s ridiculous is expecting an engineer from the 60s to anticipate the effects of a plane-building collision on a steel frame structure, and on a separate issue expecting it to be accurate. I&#39;m not saying Mr. Demartin lied in that video, but do you think he read that report? Keep in mind the alternative is that the already-massive conspiracy now includes demolition experts running into flaming towers to set charges that will be undetectable afterwards, because whoever&#39;s in charge of the operation thinks the plan so far won&#39;t cause enough damage.</p>

<p>Except for the time when a Dutch TV program had an inexperienced pilot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMCFo8IwSEs&amp;amp;t=13m">try it on a simulator</a> and it wasn&#39;t difficult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately airlines don&#39;t have g meters onboard and the flight recorders were never recovered, according to the official story, so we&#39;ll never know really, other than what radar contacts picked up and what can be extracted from that information. All the pilots are dead as well. So what we have are recreations. Whatever I watched in the past wasn&#39;t the same as what I just watched.</p>

<p>And actually, looking at some of them, if they are accurate then all of the turns appeared sound and simple, they appeared to be flown well within a normal envelope.</p>

<p>A 6g turn in a 400,000 pound airplane would be impressive too, btw and that&#39;s estimated from what I remember watching before. It was a descending right turn, sharp and sustained for a big airplane. What I just watched they maneuvered no greater than 2 G&#39;s, mostly standard turns.</p>

<p>And also, btw, flying is actually easy. Especially in a modern jet with advanced flight controls. The difficult part is not breaking the airplane, which may have endured stress and wear and tear over it&#39;s history, I doubt the simulator had those factors coded. So, I don&#39;t really care what DutchTv had on or what any tv show had, that&#39;s where the lies originated. </p>

<p>Also another main difference is the sim pilot was given instructions, he had a flight plan and is familiar with the avionics. The guy sitting in the actual plane is using his eyeballs presumably, unless he was familiar with the area and how to read the panels. Seems a bit excessive for guys who apparently got their training in a cesna? A prop plane 1,600 pounds and that flies no faster than 150 mph?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I’ve always thought flight 93 was shot down.  It is the only plane that was delayed, about 45 minutes.  And it’s the only plane that was still in hen air when the order was given to scramble jets.  </p>

<p>However, if the other planes were remotely controlled, then maybe flight 93 was too.  What if the high jackers only job was to get into the cock pit and allow for the planes to be remotely controlled.  Basically kill the pilots To prevent them from saving the day.</p>

<p>So flight 93 left late, missed it’s window, and finally was remotely sent straight down to the earth in shanksville before the scrambled jets could get to it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of all that happened, what always bothered me most was Flight 93. Maybe it was commercial jets that hit the towers, maybe they were gray, unmarked, windowless military jets, who knows - either are possible.</p>

<p>But flight 93? The pictures of the plane crash don&#39;t look like a plane crash. After a crash they put the plane together, literally, piece by piece to figure out what went wrong. This didn&#39;t happen and the pictures resemble a pile of junk, there was no luggage, no chairs or windows, nothing that resembled an airplane. Similarly, when a building &#39;pancakes&#39; as the official story states, tehre&#39;s stuff left. Chairs, computers, etc. Bodies. That didn&#39;t happen, again.</p>

<p>So it begs the question, if the plane didn&#39;t go down there, where did it go? What happened to those people? It&#39;s still possible 93 went down in the manner described, but that doesn&#39;t explain the official pictures. There is some ATC chatter that helps paint a picture of what was happening.</p>

<p>Even so, a hijacking doesn&#39;t directly indicate those blamed for this were directly involved or to blame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I guess if I got blown out of the sky by a missile or two then their wouldn&#39;t be much to piece back together.  We know for a fact a fighter jet was scrambled and got near Flight 93 but apparently was a few miles away when it went down.  They also claim the fighter jet wasn&#39;t loaded with ammo, though their are some conflicting accounts about that.  </p>

<p>I think the most likely scenario is the plane was shot down with the passengers and hijackers aboard.  That is not a fun story to tell the American public when your about to rally them into two wars.  So the official story was the passengers were brave and patriotic and whoever discounts their heroism would be shunned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what kind of jet was sent up but I can tell you about some of the weapons systems they have.</p>

<p>They use something called &#39;BVR&#39;. Beyond visual range.</p>

<p>The most modern missiles are both radar operated and have an I.R. functionality.</p>

<p>If they were trying to shoot down a commercial jet they would likely be able to see it via radar as far as 100 miles away or more. And would be able to shoot it within 40 or so.</p>

<p>Maybe a jet did shoot them down. Maybe the passengers forced the terrorists hand. That doesn&#39;t explain the pictures. Whatever that was, it wasn&#39;t a plane crash.</p>

<p>Go back through the years and see what lengths the FAA go to put the plane back together after an accident. Telling me they couldn&#39;t pull this off that time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All good points.  I think the most interesting aspect of flight 93 conspiracy is it doesn&#39;t imply deeper more wide spread conspiracies.  Its possible that flight 93 was shot down by our military and they just didn&#39;t want to explain that to the American public.  That doesn&#39;t imply a widespread inside job.   </p>

<p>Which is very different from something like building 7.  Controlled demolition means foreknowledge, planning, and execution on a massive scale.  </p>

<p>Flight 93 could just be a PR stunt on an already sad day for the United States.  If we shot it down, it would be questioned hard by media and public, even if it was the right thing to do.  Instead the PR story of heroism and crash oozes nationalism and keeps us marching towards full retaliation to whatever enemy they choose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story is plausible. Could have been shot down. Maybe the passengers charged the cockpit, particularly if they found out what their fate would be - assuming it was commercial airliners that hit the building and not something else. That would beg greater questions of course and that&#39;s probably what bothered me most, there are some questions about whether the planes themselves were commercial or not and some compelling photographic/video evidence to suggest they were not(i.e. the nose of the airplane igniting into something pre tower contact, a flame, it&#39;s hard to say as it&#39;s a single frame just before it strikes the tower. I don&#39;t remember if it&#39;s the first or second plane. What did it look like? That the nose of the aircraft was exploding before it hit the tower). If this was true though, where ever are the people from 93? Where did the flight actually go?</p>

<p>Either way, the pictures they offered up as a &#39;crash sight&#39; don&#39;t look like a crash sight, this much to me is fair to say.</p>

<p>Public references to the $2.3 trillion figure can be seen as far back as March 5, 2000</p>

<p>&quot;When you spend money, you account for it--that is required in the federal government,&quot; Jacobson said. &quot;But DOD doesn&#39;t have that. They just say, . . . &#39;We had money, we spent it.&#39; Then they try to go back later . . . to pull the balance sheet together.&quot;</p>

<p>How do you know that the 2.3 trillion wasn&#39;t an aggregated number from misreporting over a longer period of time?</p>

<p>The end result was that they could not provide documentation on how they spent that 2.3 trillion.</p>

<p>&quot;The Pentagon could not show receipts for $2.3 trillion of those changes, and half a trillion dollars of it was just corrections of mistakes made in earlier adjustments.&quot;</p>

<p>So money was &quot;missing&quot; in the sense that somebody spent it and we don&#39;t know how or on what.</p>

<p>Someone posted yesterday all of the articles from 2001/2002 in which the MSM reported high level intelligence reports that OBL&#39;s associates &quot;were looking for a dialysis machine&quot; for him.

<p>Ok, in further thinking - I can agree that the usage and need of dialysis and kidney failure <em>is</em> relevant, but the <em>tone</em> in which the first sentence was written was very much &quot;internet sarcastic&quot; and not professional in the least.  <strong>This is my opinion, of course.</strong>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were attacks on two different days. There is no real debate on the attack on the first day. The are plenty of witnesses, radar records, damage.</p>

<p>The &quot;conspiracy&quot; lies in the events of the second day, Sunday. A torrential rain storm in the Gulf and overwrought nerves makes reports of a second attack debateable. When Johnson announced there had been two attacks on a American ship in the Gulf of Tonkin, He was 100% right on the first one, and unknown at the time on the second one.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until the late 80s that the technology advanced to the point where it could be stated beyond a reasonable doubt that the second attack was just a bunch bad weather and radar shadows.</p>

<p>Of course, you can always argue that Johnson was ready for the fight and he just took a minor incident and conflagulated it enough to justify a stronger military response. And that would be correct.</p>

<p>But to say nothing happen would be false.</p>

Once established, the gulf of Tonkin incident occurred which “gave” the US the opportunity to fully engage in war. From what I got from it was that the IS seized an opportunity to finish what France began. The entirety of it is really messed up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same thing can be said for any isntitution, take school for exampke. Are you telling me it&#39;s healthy to send our kids to a place where they have to raise their hands just to speak for themselves and have to sit in a metal fucking chair for 8 hours a day and if they can&#39;t we just drug them until their braindead.  How have we let this go on during the formative years of a child&#39;s life. I&#39;ll tell you why. The government needed mommy and daddy to go away for work but needed someone to baby sit the kids. That&#39;s where school comes in. The ultimate waste of time during the most important years of a person&#39;s life where they should be exploring and questioning everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. Maybe comfort is better than freedom if the price is utter destruction. But the tyranny will only get worse. The prosperity we are experiencing now will soon fade after another false flag causes the world to go into WW3. From there, they&#39;ll make up all kinds of justifications for more civil rights violations until we&#39;re too defenseless to do anything. What do you think all these shootings are for? Even if they&#39;re not false flags the media is still using them to push gun control, and after that amendment is gone we are totally fucked. A couple days ago the EU overruled the results of an Italian election  and NO ONE CARES. Tommy Robinson is locked up for reporting and NO ONE CARES. Humans are too self obsessed too stop and think. After all, thinking would require the ability to look at things truthfully and humans just can&#39;t handle the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that&#39;s my interpratation based on the outcry in Britain over the same issue. The people wanted out yet the leaders feel they know better than the people and decided against it. Now it&#39;s happening to Italy in a different way. The people voted for a &quot;populist&quot; party, which stands in direct opposition to the EU which promotes unity in Europe. 
Here Macron talks about the politcal and idealogical battle between &quot;liberal democracy&quot; and &quot;authoritarianism&quot;: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43794856">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43794856</a> 
Yet by denying the finance minister for fear of authoritarianism is counter to liberal democracy. The EU are a body of many people so it&#39;s hard to find a direct quote from them but the European politicians that support the EU wholeheartedly are in complete oppostion to the right-wing parties all over Europe, including Hungary, Italy, France, and the UK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would depend on the resolve of the American people at the moment they admitted to it. I think they&#39;ll wait until everyone is as divided as they think they&#39;ll be, or they&#39;ll de-classify the information when everyone that remembers 9/11 is dead. We will always get bits and pieces, but never a sure-enough-thing to 100% receive condemnation of the US government from all Americans.</p>

<p>If this did happen, then I believe a few people would riot, some would organize and launch guerilla-style terror attacks, and, I really doubt this, but maybe we could have a full-blown revolution. This would cause the break-down of society, and people would rather just be snug as a bug in their shitty little houses, with their families, getting paid less and less each generation. They&#39;ll watch the same bullshit news, and eat the same bullshit food and get fat. </p>

<p>Nobody would want to overthrow the government. We&#39;re too divided, and could never agree on what to do next. But, America would break up into a bunch if smaller nations. Then people could have what they really want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, it&#39;s basically American exceptionalist hubris at work. If an American pilot pulled off a crazy manoeuver in a war he&#39;d be a hero.</p>

<p>Add a dash of American &quot;my layman understanding is all I need&quot; thinking and this is how you get the Steel Beams meme, with every chump thinking they&#39;re a structural/materials engineer now.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the alternative explanation if a commercial aircraft couldn&#39;t pull off that move at all? The plane and all passengers were disappeared and it was a missile instead?</p>

<p>FWIW my opinion is that 9/11 was not an inside job, but it sure as fuck was cynically exploited. May have even ignored warnings of an attack because they wanted an excuse for war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was missiles like I’ve said multiple times in thread, the “planes” wouldn’t have been going fast enough for aluminum to be able to penetrate steel without the damn thing exploding on impact and most of it falling to the ground or it be hanging halfway of the building. Try shooting a soda can at a semi trailer and see what happens. Ok, yes not the same thickness or exact replica but you get the point, it’s a decent representation of what would happen. You think the government has a problem with grounding planes and murdering the passengers? They wouldn’t bat an eye in the name of “freedom” or whatever sick justification they have. But you won’t listen to that, you think we’re all just paranoid and don’t think the government could pull it off. You know, not like they had trillions of dollars “missing” to play with or anything. But be naive. When the day comes and they betray you, we’ll be ready. </p>

<p>I’m sure in had nothing to do with the Global Guardian warfame going on that same day which involved a side-game called “<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Guardian">Vigilante Guardian</a>” which was a <em>simulated hijacking</em> of commercial passenger jets.</p>

<p>Vigilant Guardian was the high jacking:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In contrast to the 9/11 Commission Report - Michael Ruppert has characterized Vigilant Guardian as &quot;a hijacking drill, not a cold war excercise&quot;. He cites direct quotes from participants which indicate &quot;that the drill involved hijacked airliners rather than Russian Bombers&quot;. General Arnold, Tech. Sgt. W. Powel and Lt. Col.

<p>determining the attacks were “a failure of imagination” because “I don’t think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ” except the Pentagon and FEMA and NORAD and the NRO.</p>

<p>In 1990-91, I was a college student.  I recall a major hijacking, maybe in Singapore?  </p>

<p>At any rate, I was a bit annoyed with the concept of &#39;kidnapping a plane&#39; and flying it to Beirut, or wherever.  My quote, as a 19 or 20 year old kid:</p>

<p>&quot;If these groups really want to have publicity on an international stage, they shouldn&#39;t bother with these hijackings like this.  They should hijack a plane, and fly it into the damn World Trade Center or something.&quot;</p>

<p>A somewhat intelligent 20 year old knew that this was possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.</p>

<p>Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.</p>

<p>This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.</p>

<p>The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.</p>

<p>Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?</p>

<p>What does all this say about the American mind?</p>

<p>It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.</p>

<p>Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.</p>

<p>But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:</p>

<p>De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?</p>

<p>Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That&#39;s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don&#39;t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>He further goes on to state:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.&quot;</p>

<p>You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.</p>

<p>Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don&#39;t know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don&#39;t have the courage to do it, because you&#39;re a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don&#39;t have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you are about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it&#39;s too big to stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s my understanding that at a high enough velocity it could be possible. Like how you can do some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc-zmb3jAgo">serious damage with a ping pong ball</a> if it&#39;s going fast enough.</p>

<p>That being said, I agree. The outter steel structure of the WTC, and the fact that the architect specifically stated that the building would be able to withstand a (commercial?) plane impact, makes me super suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same thing can be said for any isntitution, take school for exampke. Are you telling me it&#39;s healthy to send our kids to a place where they have to raise their hands just to speak for themselves and have to sit in a metal fucking chair for 8 hours a day and if they can&#39;t we just drug them until their braindead.  How have we let this go on during the formative years of a child&#39;s life. I&#39;ll tell you why. The government needed mommy and daddy to go away for work but needed someone to baby sit the kids. That&#39;s where school comes in. The ultimate waste of time during the most important years of a person&#39;s life where they should be exploring and questioning everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All good points.  I think the most interesting aspect of flight 93 conspiracy is it doesn&#39;t imply deeper more wide spread conspiracies.  Its possible that flight 93 was shot down by our military and they just didn&#39;t want to explain that to the American public.  That doesn&#39;t imply a widespread inside job.   </p>

<p>Which is very different from something like building 7.  Controlled demolition means foreknowledge, planning, and execution on a massive scale.  </p>

<p>Flight 93 could just be a PR stunt on an already sad day for the United States.  If we shot it down, it would be questioned hard by media and public, even if it was the right thing to do.  Instead the PR story of heroism and crash oozes nationalism and keeps us marching towards full retaliation to whatever enemy they choose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story is plausible. Could have been shot down. Maybe the passengers charged the cockpit, particularly if they found out what their fate would be - assuming it was commercial airliners that hit the building and not something else. That would beg greater questions of course and that&#39;s probably what bothered me most, there are some questions about whether the planes themselves were commercial or not and some compelling photographic/video evidence to suggest they were not(i.e. the nose of the airplane igniting into something pre tower contact, a flame, it&#39;s hard to say as it&#39;s a single frame just before it strikes the tower. I don&#39;t remember if it&#39;s the first or second plane. What did it look like? That the nose of the aircraft was exploding before it hit the tower). If this was true though, where ever are the people from 93? Where did the flight actually go?</p>

<p>Either way, the pictures they offered up as a &#39;crash sight&#39; don&#39;t look like a crash sight, this much to me is fair to say.</p>
