<p>Army Secretary Peter Geren is expected to recommend that a retired three-star general be demoted for his role in providing misleading information about the death of Army Ranger Pat Tillman, military officials say, in what would be a stinging and rare rebuke.</p>

<p>Lt. Gen. Philip Kensinger, who headed Army special operations, is one of seven high-ranking Army officers expected to get official reprimands for making critical errors in reporting the circumstances of Tillman&#39;s friendly-fire shooting in Afghanistan in April 2004.</p>

<p>The probes found that nine officers — including four generals — were at fault in providing the bad information and should be held accountable. But the reports determined that there was no criminal wrongdoing in the actual shooting, and that there was no deliberate cover-up.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Tillman&#39;s celebrity, as one who gave up a professional football contract to join the Army after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, made his death major news. The military at first concocted a heroic story about how Tillman, a specialist posthumously promoted to corporal, had been killed in a fierce firefight with the enemy, despite obvious evidence that he had been shot by his own men at close range. More than a month later, a military investigation reported publicly that the death was not linked to enemy fire.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/13/AR2007071301929.html">White House Denies Request for Documents in Ex-NFL Player&#39;s Death</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Army medical examiners were suspicious about the close proximity of the three bullet holes in Pat Tillman&#39;s forehead and tried without success to get authorities to investigate whether the former NFL player&#39;s death amounted to a crime, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press.</p>

<p>&quot;The medical evidence did not match up with the, with the scenario as described,&quot; a doctor who examined Tillman&#39;s body after he was killed on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2004 told investigators.
The doctors — whose names were blacked out — said that the bullet holes were so close together that it appeared the Army Ranger was cut down by an M-16 fired from a mere 10 yards or so away.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Pentagon did conduct a criminal investigation, and asked Tillman&#39;s comrades whether he was disliked by his men and whether they had any reason to believe he was deliberately killed. The Pentagon eventually ruled that Tillman&#39;s death at the hands of his comrades was a friendly-fire accident.</p>

<p>The medical examiners&#39; suspicions were outlined in 2,300 pages of testimony released to the AP this week by the Defense Department in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.</p>

<p>• In his last words moments before he was killed, Tillman snapped at a panicky comrade under fire to shut up and stop &quot;sniveling.&quot;</p>

<p>• Army attorneys sent each other congratulatory e-mails for keeping criminal investigators at bay as the Army conducted an internal friendly-fire investigation that resulted in administrative, or non-criminal, punishments.</p>

<p>• The three-star general who kept the truth about Tillman&#39;s death from his family and the public told investigators some 70 times that he had a bad memory and couldn&#39;t recall details of his actions.</p>

<p>• No evidence at all of enemy fire was found at the scene — no one was hit by enemy fire, nor was any government equipment struck.</p>

<p>The Pentagon and the Bush administration have been criticized in recent months for lying about the circumstances of Tillman&#39;s death. The military initially told the public and the Tillman family that he had been killed by enemy fire. Only weeks later did the Pentagon acknowledge he was gunned down by fellow Rangers.</p>

<p>With questions lingering about how high in the Bush administration the deception reached, Congress is preparing for yet another hearing next week.</p>

<p>The Pentagon is separately preparing a new round of punishments, including a stinging demotion of retired Lt. Gen. Philip R. Kensinger Jr., 60, according to military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the punishments under consideration have not been made public.</p>

<p>In more than four hours of questioning by the Pentagon inspector general&#39;s office in December 2006, Kensinger repeatedly contradicted other officers&#39; testimony, and sometimes his own. He said on some 70 occasions that he did not recall something.</p>

<p>At one point, he said: &quot;You&#39;ve got me really scared about my brain right now. I&#39;m really having a problem.&quot;</p>

<p>Tillman&#39;s mother, Mary Tillman, who has long suggested that her son was deliberately killed by his comrades, said she is still looking for answers and looks forward to the congressional hearings next week.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing is going to bring Pat back. It&#39;s about justice for Pat and justice for other soldiers. The nation has been deceived,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>The documents show that a doctor who autopsied Tillman&#39;s body was suspicious of the three gunshot wounds to the forehead. The doctor said he took the unusual step of calling the Army&#39;s Human Resources Command and was rebuffed. He then asked an official at the Army&#39;s Criminal Investigation Division if the CID would consider opening a criminal case.</p>

<p>&quot;He said he talked to his higher headquarters and they had said no,&quot; the doctor testified.</p>

<p>Also according to the documents, investigators pressed officers and soldiers on a question Mrs. Tillman has been asking all along.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you, at any time since this incident occurred back on April 22, 2004, have you ever received any information even rumor that Cpl. Tillman was killed by anybody within his own unit intentionally?&quot; an investigator asked then-Capt. Richard Scott.</p>

<p>Scott, and others who were asked, said they were certain the shooting was accidental.</p>

<p>Investigators also asked soldiers and commanders whether Tillman was disliked, whether anyone was jealous of his celebrity, or if he was considered arrogant. They said Tillman was respected, admired and well-liked.</p>

<p>The documents also shed new light on Tillman&#39;s last moments.</p>

<p>It has been widely reported by the AP and others that Spc. Bryan O&#39;Neal, who was at Tillman&#39;s side as he was killed, told investigators that Tillman was waving his arms shouting &quot;Cease fire, friendlies, I am Pat (expletive) Tillman, damn it!&quot; again and again.</p>

<p>But the latest documents give a different account from a chaplain who debriefed the entire unit days after Tillman was killed.</p>

<p>The chaplain said that O&#39;Neal told him he was hugging the ground at Tillman&#39;s side, &quot;crying out to God, help us. And Tillman says to him, &#39;Would you shut your (expletive) mouth? God&#39;s not going to help you; you need to do something for yourself, you sniveling ...&quot;

<p>Soldiers on the scene said they were immediately sure Tillman was killed by a barrage of American bullets as he took shelter behind a large boulder during a twilight firefight along a narrow canyon road near the Pakistani border, according to nearly 2,000 pages of interview transcripts and investigative reports obtained by The Washington Post.</p>

<p>The documents also show that officers made erroneous initial reports that Tillman was killed by enemy fire, destroyed critical evidence and initially concealed the truth from Tillman&#39;s brother, also an Army Ranger, who was near the attack on April 22, 2004, but did not witness it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can’t believe no one has mentioned this yet.</p>

<p>The reason is most likely tied to the fact that WTC 7 held some critical offices to National Security. Namely, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-cia-lost-office-in-wtc/">the CIA</a>.</p>

<p>My theory: WTC 7 was always rigged for demolition in the event that the CIA office had to be evacuated by all personnel. The last person to leave starts the timer, leaves, and notice is given to the Fire Department that the decision has been made to pull the building, so it gets evacuated by all FD personnel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive soent a lot of time thinking about this and how it fits. And believe you me that i dont believe the official explanation. Wtc7 was definately rigged to blow but the decision to do that wasnt a primary part of the overal plan. As if it was a plan b option.</p>

<p>So was it pulled to hide some kind of corporate intel or aomething along those lines? Possibly. But why the whole building? Maybe part of the plan was to burn certain areas and if maybe that wasnt successful then the killswitch could have been used.</p>

<p>Was it pulled for aome type of public safety concern? Super duper minimal possibility. Mostly because this could have been executed later after the madness with the consultation of many other people when things calmed down the next day or through the week.</p>

<p>Money? This is my best guess and i think it fits occams razor. Why was larry involved so much? I guess because he was in on it but for the insurance payouts. He got twice back in insurance for all 3 buildings if im not mistaken. TWICE. So he didnt just get paid back and compensated for the destruction. He sued again and got a second double dip. This guy made out like a bandit. And this is one of the facts we dont need to theorize. I mean, go double check that i am recalling it correctly, but its not a theory. It happened. My guess is he insisted on being given a killswitch for wtc7 and the option to pull. That order was relayed to those capable of execution and when larry made the call they followed his order. Then larry got paid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>of course i&#39;ve been to new york.  it&#39;s impossible to demolish a building without damaging another.  half of the highrises in nyc have nets on them because they&#39;re falling apart, but they can&#39;t be traditionally demolished, because a controlled demolition is not controlled enough to not affect other buildings in an urban setting.  they literally have to pick buildings apart from the top down, and they&#39;ve never done it on a building as large as the WTC buildings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a lot of good answers here</p>

<p>record destruction
insurance
free up the land </p>

<p>the differential in land price before and after the demolition of the entire complex is massive due to the fact they were condemned buildings filled with asbesthos</p>

<p>if they left it up it would still have to be destroyed and in another 5 hours it would have been a symbol of resilience, if it was still standing it would have been a huuuuuuge mess for the owners.  </p>

<p>the first step to realizing what 9/11 is about is realizing they were condemned buildings the owner desperately wanted destroyed, not some national treasure or precious infrastructure.</p>

<p>Think about it, now this one guy and his descendants and friends have the &#39;freedom&#39; sic tower, maybe the biggest perpetual free money fountain in the world, and that may print money for hundreds of years.  </p>

<p>Dozens of people won&#39;t work a day in their lives from this money, and silverstein is a zionist over american, so you can expect all manner of israel/mossad hijinx in that building for sure.  (just like you can the new white house probably btw fwiw)</p>

<p>building 7 was taken down because it was planned, because someone wanted to capitalize on the real estate price differential and avoid costly government regulations, and they wanted the power to rebuild things and profit off of it.  </p>

<p>it&#39;s like buying an old car that can barely even move, throwing a rock at it, then claiming it was destroyed by religious fanatics from peru, and then using the insurance money to build an 18 wheeler and then calling yourself a national hero.  </p>

<p>only there were 3000 people killed and it freaked everybody in the world t/f out.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Silverstein had drawn up plans for WTC7’s replacement well before 9/11.  Like the other buildings it was riddled with asbestos and a white elephant that would require a very expensive refit  to clear it. </p>

<p>Better to grossly over insure the building and demolish it. </p>

<p>The perps behind 9/11 needed Silverstein’s help to lease the whole site, he actually only owned WTC7, to change the security  and maintenance crews and allow access to plant explosives, as planes alone would not bring them down. In effect the planes were the patsies.</p>

<p>Silverstein’s reward for his cooperation and silence, was a new asbestos free building and of course the enormous insurance payout for the whole site. </p>

<p>The “reward” for the responders and workers clearing the site, is continuing illness and death from the effects of inhaling the asbestos dust. Not sure, but I think I read that more fireman et al, have died since 9/11 from related health issues than died on the day, The “gift” that keeps on killing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t grossly over insure it. The financial backers actually wanted more insurance coverage. Larry actually wanted less.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Silverstein was wrangling with the banks backing his bid, Mr. Boyd explained in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Observer . The banks wanted $5 billion in coverage. Mr. Silverstein’s team, which then valued the complex at $3.9 billion, argued that a total catastrophe was “outside the realm of possibility.” Mr. Silverstein himself had dismissed the cost of such insurance-$25 million a year-as “far too expensive,” the memo said.</p>

<p>Ultimately the banks settled for less, $3.5 billion in coverage. Twelve days later, Mr. Silverstein closed the deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Silverstein also wasn&#39;t the one who originally won the bidding to begin with. Vornado won but the owner didn&#39;t have enough financial backing to pay the price he bid. After several months the Port Authority gave up with them and went to the runner up, Larry, who still had backing issues to work out himself even.</p>

<p>That being said, Larry owed a mortgage on the buildings. The insurance payout had to pay for that. The actual contract also required that he rebuild the buildings along with paying the same rent payment even if a building wasn&#39;t there. Just to try and get enough to cover everything he had to go through lawsuits (lawsuits which he didn&#39;t win). So, for a guy who was so in on it...he&#39;s seems very out of the loop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was filled with asbestos is one theory. Silverstein bought it, but instead of paying more than the building was worth to clean it up, he had it demolished and cashed out on the insurance - twice, I believe, since the WTC was considered two terrorist attacks.</p>
