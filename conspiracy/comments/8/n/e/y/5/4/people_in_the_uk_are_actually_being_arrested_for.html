        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The UK has arrived at this dystopian milestone because the populace has been steadily and consistently conditioned to accept it.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve been programmed to believe that expression of self without acceptance from the majority is dangerous.... reckless. This is done ever so subtly and incrementally over a large span of time by social engineers who know exactly which human emotional weaknesses to exploit in order to make the people themselves beg for laws which limit their inherent freedoms. These social engineers stand behind curtains while poking the cattle with emotional prods,  urging them to cascade down the Hallway of Outrage that opportunity has offered.</p>

<p>It has now come to a head in the UK. There are now <strong>legal consequences</strong> being dealt out due to subjective interpretations of anonymous people.  FFS.  It only got to this point because the people were prodded into asking for it; they allowed themselves to be manipulated.   Shaming those that go against the mainsteam flow has been normalized to the point that people are going to jail for fucking words.   <strong>Words</strong>.   Posting Snoop Dog lyrics was enough in one case. </p>

<p>This social engineering dynamic is at work in the US as well.  I watch it happen over and over. We,  as a herd,  are regularly being prodded to beg for censorship of others.  &quot;I don&#39;t like what they say,  they must be silenced,  they shouldn&#39;t be able to say that because [insert media-inspired rant]&quot;.</p>

<p>The media has marching orders; they are the functional hand of the social engineers.  They are assigned certain targets and warned away from others.  It is made clear to them who to lampoon,  and who to root for or ignore altogether. If you think this is just tin-foil idiocy you should look into Operation Mockingbird. </p>

<p>I am watching the mob of followers here in the USA trample down the exact same path the UK has.  Our destination is the same.</p>

<p>Will it be within our lifetime that we see people in the US arrested for posting Rage Against the Machine lyrics just because some anonymous prick didn&#39;t like the anti-establishment message? If we continue allowing the social engineers to dictate our direction,  the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;. That is their plan and their goal.</p>

<p>The last few days,  I&#39;ve been accused of supporting racism when I express a view which is different from that of an angry mob chasing Roseanne through the streets of Reddit.   </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with Roseanne&#39;s racist comments. </p>

<p>On the other hand,  I don&#39;t agree with the people hopping onto the Outrage Bandwagon.  They&#39;re allowing themselves to be puppeteered by the social engineers. Their reactions and overreactions to these public opinion-sculpting-events are the grease in the gears of our own dystopian future. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s all just calm down...  take a few steps back.  Let&#39;s please remember that the ability of people to say things that are against the grain without being taken to jail is what America is touted to be all about.  I sure would like to keep it that way  for generations to come.  I know most of you would too. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not go the way of the UK. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A home run OP and a huge issue- very concerning that it would be just ad hoc downvoted. </p>

<p>What is Hate? To preface, let’s start with the English-language definition of the word “hate.”</p>

<p>Hate: feel intense dislike for. (Golly, put the handcuffs on.)</p>

<p>Synonyms: loathe, detest, dislike greatly, abhor, despise, execrate, feel aversion towards, feel revulsion towards, feel hostile towards, be repelled by, be revolted by, regard with disgust, not be able to bear/stand, be unable to stomach, find intolerable, shudder at, recoil from, shrink from</p>

<p>No one is free from these sentiments, nor should they be. It is normal. Hate crimes are a totally different seperate category.</p>

<p>Before becoming a buzzword abused by politicians and social justice warriors, “hate” was certainly not a criminal thing. It’s was merely a sentiment. Only recently, Newspeak began attaching to it adjectives such as “extreme.” The label of “extreme hate,” or “hater,” is a useful tool for criminals to hide behind and deflect criticism.</p>

<p>Hate, as a concept, has been looked at by wise men throughout the ages. And they often got the context and even merit of it. They recognized that forces of evil existed in the world.</p>

<p>“They never will love where they ought to love, who do not hate where they ought to hate.” — Edmund Burke</p>

<p>“We do urge hate: If you love something, that love requires you to hate anything that threatens its survival.” — Matthew Hale</p>

<p>“Achilles glared at him and answered, ‘Fool, prate not to me about covenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves and lambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out an through. Therefore, there can be no understanding between you and me, nor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shall fall.” — Homer, “The Iliad”</p>

<p>“Feeding milk and bananas to a serpent only makes its venom more potent.” — Chanakya Pandita, Raja niti sastra, expeller of Alexander the Great</p>

<p>“A time to tear apart and a time to sew together; a time to be silent and a time to speak. A time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace.” — Ecclesiastes 7</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh look. Another anti-UK thread.</p>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been 1000 of these lately.</p>

<p>Well, i&#39;m off to school. I hope I don&#39;t get shot or kidnapped by the state. I hope my school milk isn&#39;t radioactive and that the injections I get today don&#39;t turn me into a retard. Ah, well, there&#39;s always school lunch, which contains plastics and chemicals that will destroy my ability to think. Not that it matters, it&#39;s only History anyway and according to these books, the USA wins everything. </p>

<p>Time to stand up and sing the pledge of indoctrination. I&#39;m glad we have a choice in singing this anthem and that are top athletes don&#39;t get arrested for being black.</p>

<p>Ah, the land of the free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in the UK, I can assure that we do. While there are some cases where heavy handed enforcement has lead to abuse, these have so far been isolated incidents.</p>

<p>Currently as part of the EU we fall under the European Convention of Human Rights which includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights">Article 10</a> in regards to freedom of expression. </p>

<p>As for self defense, in say for example a home invasion, that is covered and we are allowed to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/reasonable-force-against-intruders">use reasonable force against intruders</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Article 10</p>

<p>“subject to certain restrictions that are &quot;in accordance with law&quot; and &quot;necessary in a democratic society&quot;</p>

<p>Which, as has recently been demonstrated to you, can be extended to absolutely anything your government feels like. Like say, teaching your girlfriends pug to Nazi salute as a crude joke.</p>

<p>In America, we aren’t <em>allowed</em> to own guns and protect our lives, it’s considered a natural given inalienable right.</p>

<p>And as it <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1461346/Five-years-in-prison-for-acting-in-self-defence.html">turns out</a>, you’re <em>allowed</em> <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/04/suspected-burglar-dies-tussle-pensioner-78/amp/">no such thing</a></p>

<p>In America, we understand that the first and 2nd amendment were emblazoned into the bill of rights in that order for a reason, and that the 2nd protects the first. Your government understands it can push you around with impunity, so it does. Look at the absolute disgrace with Tommy Robinson last weekend. I wish that were the worst of their transgressions against freedom of speech but it’s not. I feel terribly sorry for you lot and the place you’re headed. I’m not surprised though, they’ve got you actually believing you have rights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll agree, the pug this was stupid. The most he should of got was ridiculed for such a childish action, but it escalated and the end result was just stupid. However, like I said incidents like this are few and far between. Unless you&#39;re being offensive in an outrageously over the top manner or directly threatening someone with actual harm then it&#39;s pretty easy to not get arrested.</p>

<p>As for the articles you linked, the guy plead to manslaughter in the first one, had he stuck to self defense then considering the circumstances he would almost certainly have avoided jail. It was less like the Tony Martin case where the jury was torn because he shot them in the back as they were running away.</p>

<p>In the second one the guy was<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/pensioner-burglar-stabbeddeath-released-henry-vincent-london-hither-green-kent-a8292721.html">released without charge</a>, so again, you are allowed to defend yourself. I will add though that is was sickening that he was essentially forced out of his house by the harassment of the travelers after the incident. </p>

<p>As for Tommy Robinson, I have no sympathy for him. He knew he would be in Contempt of Court when he brought the camera into the court and recorded outside and he knew it&#39;d get him arrested. If you think that was freedom of speech issue then you&#39;re the gullible one here. I bet he counted on getting arrested since it would get him some juicy publicity and a reason the rally his equally racist supporters. The only questionable action in that ordeal was the reporting restriction, which I didn&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>For the record I&#39;ve had to deal with people like Tommy Robinson in the past. Small minded football hooligans who grow-up to be racist thugs. It doesn&#39;t matter whether they claim to be part of the NF, BNP, EDL or whatever they go by now. They thrive on hate and violence and the more notice we give them the stronger they grow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pug thing is a childish prank, something I would expect to see on a WWII version of Blackadder. There&#39;s no deep freedom of speech meaning behind, just a joke in bad taste and some the courts wanted to make an example of. Do I think he should have been fined? No. Do I also think it&#39;s appropriate to upload a video of you teaching a do to do a Nazi salute while you say &quot;Gas the Jews!&quot;. Also no.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter that Tommy Robinson is racist, he broke the law by being in contempt of court. If you want to argue that sneaking a camera into court and interfering with an ongoing trial shouldn&#39;t be a crime then lets go, I&#39;ll happily discuss that.</p>

<p>I agree it doesn&#39;t matter hes racist, you just seemed to harp on that in your previous post as if it was important. Speaking of somebody being made an example of...he didn&#39;t sneak a camera into court. He was outside the building on a public sidewalk. Cmon dude you don&#39;t even know the story and your painting this guy as a degenerate racist who deserves the 13 month sentence he likely won&#39;t survive.

<p>Yes, they made an example of him, but it was more to do with the fact that in the video he was stating &quot;Gas the Jews!&quot;. I suspect that had he used any other racial slur then he would have gotten a similar response. Also I suspect that had he admitted the joke was in bad taste he wouldn&#39;t have been made an example of.</p>

<p>The original suspended sentence regarding Tommy Robinson involved him <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/20/tommy-robinson/">bringing a camera into Canterbury Crown Court</a>.  You might want to check his record before you jump to defend him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is that there seems to be a concerted effort between the police, the CPS and the courts to punish people for &quot;causing offence&quot; which is a very slippery slope because offence is subjective. </p>

<p>The recent Alison Chabloz case is an unfortunate milestone in English legal history.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-44253085">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-44253085</a></p>

<p>She was convicted of causing &quot;gross offence&quot; for things like mocking the veracity of the Anne Frank diaries, and referring to Auschwitz as &quot;a theme park&quot; - which is exactly what Auschwitz has become. She will sentenced next month, and may go to prison. Even if you strongly disagree with her views, questioning historical narratives should never be deemed &quot;offensive&quot;. </p>

<p>The UK has crossed a dangerous line, and if she gets a custodial sentence then we will have joined the many other countries where any criticism of anything Jewish is a criminal offence.</p>

<p>and again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The above isn&#39;t really true. What she was convicted of was &quot;sending grossly offensive messages.&quot; </p>

<p>And the only reason she got done for that is because she used YouTube to publish her stuff. YouTube is defined as social media, even if most people just use it as an archive for watching interesting bits and bobs.</p>

<p>If Chabloz had set up her own website, and published her video directly on that website (rather than using YouTube), there would have been nothing the law could have done.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a slightly weird distinction, but it&#39;s a real one. There are laws about <em>sending</em> (n.b.) offensive messages, but there are pretty much no laws about what you can or can&#39;t publish in a non-message format.</p>

<p>As for whether this case was a wise use of police and court time, I don&#39;t think it was. But that&#39;s another discussion altogether.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A teenager who posted rap lyrics which included racist language on Instagram has been found guilty of sending a grossly offensive message.
Chelsea Russell, 19, from Liverpool posted the lyric from Snap Dogg&#39;s I&#39;m Trippin&#39; to pay tribute to a boy who died in a road crash, a court heard.
Russell argued it was not offensive, but was handed a community order.
Prosecutors said her sentence was increased from a fine to a community order &quot;as it was a hate crime&quot;.
She was charged after Merseyside Police were anonymously sent a screenshot of her update.
&#39;Grossly offensive&#39;
Liverpool Justice Centre, sitting at Sefton Magistrates&#39; Court, heard Russell posted the lyrics to her account after the death of a 13-year-old in a road accident in 2017, the Crown Prosecution Service said.
The words Russell used on her account contained a racial label which some people find extremely offensive.
The screenshot was passed to hate crime unit PC Dominique Walker, who told the court the term was &quot;grossly offensive&quot; to her as a black woman and to the general community.
The Liverpool Echo reported that Russell&#39;s defence had argued the usage of the word had changed over time and it had been used by superstar rapper Jay-Z &quot;in front of thousands of people at the Glastonbury Festival&quot;.
Prosecutor Angela Conlan said Russell&#39;s defence also argued her profile &quot;wasn&#39;t public&quot;, but it had been proved in court that anyone could access it and &quot;see the offensive language&quot;.
She said prosecutors also &quot;sourced case law that showed that posting the profile on her account constituted sending it and making it public&quot;.
Russell was found guilty of sending a grossly offensive message by a public communication.
She was given an eight-week community order, placed on an eight-week curfew and told to pay costs of £500 and an £85 victim surcharge. </p>

<p>The surcharge is not paid directly to the criminal&#39;s victim, but is pooled and distributed through the Victim and Witness General Fund. The amount to be paid is specified by law, and courts have no discretion to reduce the amount, nor to waive the surcharge, even for defendants of limited means.[3] The law journalist Joshua Rozenberg has reported cases where a surcharge levied against a young person became the responsibility of their parents - even when a parent was the victim of the crime in question.</p>

<p>The original post claims that the woman was arrested for pointing out Muslims preying in a park, but if you read the comments it quickly becomes apparent that she has threatened multiple people herself and was threatening violent behavior towards others. Considering the racially motivated assaults that seem to have spiked in the past couple of years this is something that the police tend to take seriously.</p>

<p>That you&#39;ve intentionally put your blinders on doesn&#39;t detract from the fact that people are being held legally responsible for subjective interpretations of others. You want to believe you haven&#39;t been programmed. So does everyone else.
Nobody wants to admit they&#39;ve been led around by the nose. The sooner we do away with our pride and admit what has happened, however, the sooner we can move forward and rectify it.</p>

<p>Yup, the title was misleading. That lady was charged with assault, not hate speech. Funny thing is,  you can&#39;t use the misleading title of a post here as proof that the topic is being chronically misreprented in media.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point,  let&#39;s see what the numbers are... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>British police are arresting nine people per day for attacks on the internet as they attempt to clamp down on hate speech online.</p>

<p>Last year, more than 3,300 people were detained and questioned, according to the Times. Police in London arrested 867 people last year while West Midlands police arrested 635 suspects. The increase in the Midlands is staggering as figures showed an 877 percent rise in the number of arrests since 2014, when 65 people were detained.</p>

<p>Using Freedom of Information requests, the Times found that 3,395 people across 29 forces were arrested last year under section 127 of the Communications Act 2003.</p>

<p>The act allows officers to investigate messages and posts which are “grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character.”</p>

<p>In 2014 there were 2,315 arrests, compared with 2,755 in 2015. This means there has been a rise of almost 50 percent between 2014 and 2016. However, 15 forces did not submit data, meaning the real figure is likely to be higher. Last year 1,696 people were charged and 1,399 convicted – despite almost 4,000 arrests.</p>

<p>Police have been blasted over what some see as a misuse of resources. “These figures bear out what we’ve been saying: that police are wasting more and more time investigating people for comments online that are offensive but not criminal,” Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of Index on Censorship, told the Times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Convenient how you decided not to included this:</p>

<p>&quot;However, of these, around half of the investigations were dropped before prosecutions and campaigners have accused the police of threatening free speech.&quot;</p>

<p>So around half of these arrests were unwarranted and had no merit. </p>

<p>I will admit, the ratings system that has been implemented has resulted in the police actively pursuing easily closed cases, such as online hate speech, but 1,400 people in a year is still minuscule.</p>

<p>For context in 2016 there was around 65 million people in the UK (rounding down). So that&#39;s 0.0022% of the population in one year.</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to bet that in the so called &#39;land of the free&#39;, you lock up more then that on a daily basis for even minor crimes.</p>

<p>The fact is that they have to investigate all complaints, and only a small number result in prosecutions. I understand that it&#39;s perfectly acceptable for people to hold <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally">racist rallies</a> with little to no repercussion by the police because they&#39;re too busy shooting minorities but elsewhere things are different. </p>

<p>Brilliant deduction Watson.</p>

<p>That boot on your throat must be interfering with oxygen supply to your head parts. </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna express something you&#39;ve NEVER bothered to consider before. </p>

<p>What if something you did wasn&#39;t wrong at all,  but was in violation of an unjust law?  You do realize that laws can be passed which are immoral and just plain WRONG... That something being written into law doesn&#39;t magically equate to it being &quot;right&quot;... </p>

<p>For example,  if a law was passed which makes washing your hands after getting shit on them illegal,  washing shit off your hands wouldn&#39;t be legal,  but,  it also wouldn&#39;t be WRONG.</p>

<p>Laws don&#39;t determine morality.
It could be law that you have to lick a horses asshole every morning.   You will be labeled a criminal for not doing it,  but that doesnt make you wrong,  or racist,  or any other idiotic label conformists use to shame you for not conforming to their unjust law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would appear that I have touched a nerve, how curious.</p>

<p>I am familiar with unjust laws, and that if they are immoral and wrong that they should not be followed, but we are not talking about an unjust law here. The law itself was written to protect people. We are talking about the enforcement of the law and how each of the cases we have discussed it could have been enforced inappropriately. </p>

<p>You seem unable to grasp the concept that a law could be up for interpretation by the language used when it is written, and as a result must be followed to the letter with no deviation. That is not the case, context is key and must always be considered.</p>

<p>I am starting to think we are reaching an impasse here. I believe that people should be free to live their live in peace, free from discriminatory, abusive or threatening words or behavior and harassment without facing the consequences of their actions. You obviously feel different and believe that people should be free to harass, bully, threaten and otherwise discriminate without consequence. I can only assume that you have lived a privileged life and never actually had to suffer any of these actions, on the contrary I would not be surprised if you have been the perpetrator of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you really have no clue. 
Most people who are against Tommy Robinson&#39;s arrest are NOT football hooligans but houswives, workers, dads...normal people who are worried and are not allowed to express themselves.
Why not? Because being against immigration is now hate speech and you can get arrested for it. Even if you are not racist at all, just worried about your own culture.</p>

<p>People like you peddle this crap by generalising. First of all TR is not with the EDL any longer, nor is he a football hooligan any longer. He is now a journalist that wants to highlight the unfairness of muslm child grooming gangs.</p>

<p>How is that bad? </p>

<p>Sure, get togethers will &#39;also&#39; attract some rightwing people and maybe a handful of football hooligans but man, calling everyone the same is part of the brainwashing.</p>

<p>How do you expect a normal, average worried Brit to voice their concerns? There are no other ways, so you&#39;ll find absolutely normal, law abiding Brits in the majority who see an opportunity to meet others and voice their concern. Not for much longer I fear.</p>

<p>By calling them all racists/rightwing or football hooligans, you are distorting the truth to fit an agenda but it is simply not true.</p>

30 years of keeping quiet about the grooming gangs, months of court dates and no result, compared to one guy reporting into a mobile phone getting arrested, tried without a jury and sentenced to 13 months in prison [arrested under a bogus reason], all within 5 hours.</p>

<p>This ain&#39;t right. And now OP posted a very important change in our British laws that I or you or anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with the official opinion can be sentenced to prison, for a minimum of 2 years, if someone, some butt hurt person FEELS that you offended them. No evidence needed. It&#39;s all in writing. 
Hello work camps!</p>

<p>This is scary, and this needs to be highlighted even more. Until it is scrapped. How you can belittle something this important and paint everyone with one brush shows how you have no idea about the seriousness of this.</p>

<p>I lived through the E/W-Germany palaver and the fall of the wall. I had friends from e-germany that are far more alert than you are because they lived through it and recognise the signs.</p>

<p>And the trajectory is already almost there. Prison for a perceived opinion! 
And you walk into it with stary eyes. I&#39;m not.</p>

<p>think you really have no clue. Most people who are against Tommy Robinson&#39;s arrest are NOT football hooligans but houswives, workers, dads...normal people who are worried and are not allowed to express themselves. Why not? Because being against immigration is now hate speech and you can get arrested for it. Even if you are not racist at all, just worried about your own culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said they were. Two different points... </p>

<p>The judges reporting ban is annoying.</p>

<p>The fact that UK is riddled with football hooligans is annoying. I bet you are saying this wearing a Liverpool FC top and a skin&#39;ed acting like im the dickhead!? That was rude, I&#39;m sorry. </p>

<p>By calling them all racists/rightwing or football hooligans, you are distorting the truth to fit an agenda but it is simply not true.</p>

<p>When did I say that bro? Pretty sure my comment made it clear I was saying the UK and USA has Muppets in it but we aren&#39;t all like that. Tommy Robinson though is a muppet.</p>

<p>Jesus. I said the reporting ban was annoying. How have you survived this long?  I&#39;m sorry, again that was rude.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t think for one second I&#39;m not game to do my part if and when that day comes. But if you think I&#39;m going to waste my life defending Tommy fucking Robinson.  </p>

<p>If anyone&#39;s gonna beat the bullshit they got to think outside, inside the box. </p>

<p>Persona number 4 fucked himself. The legal system is screwed we all know that and the the guy is number 1 dickhead in Britain. </p>

<p>We literally saw the treatment of Assange and Snowden etc. whoever else has got fucked. So of course if he allows himself to get arrested. He&#39;s going to get screwed and now it&#39;s Good Night Mr Tom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. No man I was just taking the piss. </p>

<p>Did you see that post about that crazy bitch that sent a fella 65,000 texts? When she was being interviewed she was going &quot;I don&#39;t like your energy.&quot;</p>

<p>I swore to myself the next person to give me shit was getting that. That was you. I&#39;m sorry.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t find you rude? Did I say that? Apologies if so I was saying I&#39;m sorry for being rude. Felt like I give you a few digs. Alot of people prefer the obvious passive aggressive method. </p>

<p>I like to just be obviously rude and then apologies. I&#39;d prefer not to apologies but it&#39;s also funny that in our society you can make some vibrations with your voice box in the form of giving some one shit and it apparently hurts theit feelings and offends them. Then you can make another vibration in the form of an apology and then it&#39;s ok and their feelings get mended. </p>

<p>And there is not a monkeys chance in hell anyone here could make me really that angry. Sure I read some annoying shit and cant help but comment or post but I honestly don&#39;t care enough to get actually angry. I&#39;ll always take humour over anger, bro..</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not telling you to think outside the box i&#39;m telling everyone to think outside, inside the box. It was on the train in John Wick 2.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said.   It’s scary.   Being arrested for hate speech because somebody got offended at your words.  That’s all they are at the end of the day.  It is absolutely bloody ridiculous.   What gets me is the amount of hate and threats someone like Tommy Robinson (for example) receives off Muslims, however, they do not get in trouble for their words.  How is it fair to favour one group and not the other?</p>

<p>Ah, but stop to appreciate the beauty of it, comrade.  Being &quot;offended&quot; is a completely <em>subjective</em> experience.  Ergo, it is literally <em>impossible</em> to say something and be <em>sure</em> that it will not offend someone.  </p>

<p>What does this mean?  It means that the larger goal is not cultural censorship, but self censorship.</p>

<p>Think that through.  The goal is not to determine what you can and cannot say.  The goal is to make you apprehensive about anything you say regrading, especially, certain subjects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that. It’s  an interesting way to look at it. But really I’m not interested in self censorship.  I think about the bigger picture - a totalitarian state.  The U.K. is building up to it more and more. The surveillance is everywhere.  I’m certain we are the most surveyed country in the world.  I don’t know what’s going on with the snoopers charter (such an apt name, isn’t it)  but that already gives you an indication of how they think.   Add it up with the protection of Islam, the degradation of society, all under the guise of political correctness (which is becoming more absurd each day) together with arrests of people saying nasty things :’(( and banning journalists and human beings from this country for criticising Allah. The media are pigs, pushing their agenda. Police on Twitter, monitoring hate speech, allowing paedophiles to fly under the radar for years, police who are freemasonic working for a Masonic, pedo government who are appointed by the Royal family, and I don’t need to say anything about them ...... with all this in mind, the larger  goal is definitely more about a completely controlled, totalitarian state, where we are constantly monitored and manipulated, rather than making citizens scared of saying certain things (which they are already) something like 1984 comrade, that’s the larger goal </p>
