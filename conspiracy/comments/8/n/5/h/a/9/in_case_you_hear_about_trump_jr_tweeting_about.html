Go get em!&quot; Its sort of a weird question to ask if he felt personally responsible for this happening. It&#39;s fine if you think Soros is an asshole with too much money and power in politics all over the world. But he wasnt some Nazi collaborator or symapthizer. He calls them a tremendous threat of evil. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of reasons you could find for why you dont like Soros. But trying to paint him as a Nazi is jumping the shark. </p>

<p>Dont give a shot about Soros, but he was a Jewish kid during the holocaust, not a Nazi.</p>

<p>Yep, definitely beleieve in evolution. </p>

<p>Yeah I&#39;m a liberal who voted for Obama</p>

<p>Yeah Q is a larp who writes fan fiction for Trump supporters. Wheres the Hillary tape? Wheres the picture of Obama in a muslim outfit shooting a gun? Why isnt Hillary or Obama or Podesta or Huma in any legal trouble as Q has suggested many times?  Because it&#39;s all a bunch of bullshit.</p>

<p>Yeah I&#39;m not a conservative. Didnt realize I had to be in order to be allowed here. </p>

<p>Yeah Trump hired a bunch of criminals with close ties to Russia, definitely doesnt look good for him. </p>

<p>I said the NRA has more incentive to fake mass shootings then the government, considering they make loads of money after every shooting and the government hasn&#39;t taken guns away after endless mass shootings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont watch CNN. But cool you found a few times where someone said something false on a channel that&#39;s been running 24 hours a day for over 20 years.</p>

<p>Are we allowed to beleieve in any conspiracies involving Trump or are those off limits?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a rule of thumb for Conspiracies, if it is played on repeat on Mainstream channels for 24 months straight.</p>

<p>Its not a conspiracy its a controlled narrative.</p>

<p>And for example Trump being good pals with Jeff Epstein, owner of Lolita Express and Lolita Island and saying in an interview </p>

<p>&quot;jeff likes his girls young&quot; </p>

<p>before the guy was arrested.</p>

<p>See thats a solid Trump conspiracy that isnt on the airwaves, not to mention the pictures of him hanging out partying with the Clintons.</p>

<p>The Russia gate thing is a circus act that will lead nowhere, he will not be indicted.</p>

<p>Doesnt mean he isnt a deepstate plant.</p>

<p>Now I ask again do you actually believe in any conspiracies maybe something non-political, I can tell you like to argue about politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think Trump will get indicted or impeached. But hes been Russia&#39;s useful idiot at least by just looking at the people he chose to hire. And he acts like hes not allowed to say anything bad about them for some reason. Hillary got non stop coverage on Fox for all of her scandals, does that mean they arent real conspiracies too? I think there are elite pedophile rings, and I like talking about people behind the scenes that are pulling all the strings. I just dont buy into the whole &quot;they are all liberal satan worshippers who eat children.&quot; I like talking about government cover ups, what&#39;s really going on with Isreal vs Palestine and how they seem to have an overwhelming effect on our politicians. Theres plenty to discuss. </p>
