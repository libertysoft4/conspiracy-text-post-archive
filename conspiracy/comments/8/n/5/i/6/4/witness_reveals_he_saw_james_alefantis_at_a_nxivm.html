This post contains a video with a witness who saw quite a few public figures at a NXIVM mixer. It looks like they were part of the cult’s recruitment efforts.</p>

Apparently Bronfman funding was also instrumental in the establishment of a place owned by Alefantis called Transformer gallery. The same family funding NXIVM funded an art gallery for Alefantis.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hardly clear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transformer’s 2014/2015 Exhibition Series and programs are supported by: The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, The CrossCurrents Foundation, The DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities/ NEA, The Morris &amp; Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, The National Endowment for the Arts’ Access to Artistic Excellence Award, and The Visionary Friends of Transformer – individual donors, members of our Annual Auction Host Committee, and Corporate Sponsors</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the 2014/15 exhibition series was supported by 6 organisations including the Cafritz foundation.</p>

<p>How much support did they provide? Was it just financial?</p>

<p>The Rainiere connection is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Out of her six figure annual stipend from her father’s trust, Miss Cafritz paid for all of Mr. Raniere’s personal living expenses for many years. In their domicile, she regarded herself not only Mr. Raniere’s slave, but also a slave to her sister wife and live-in harem member, Mariana Fernandez who was 20 years her junior. Miss Fernandez is rumored to be pregnant with Mr. Raniere’s child.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a wealthy (now deceased) daughter of the Cafritz family used her own money to support Raniere, it wasn&#39;t an official payment by the charity. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t much of a connection, this is 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon. </p>

<p>Its the same goddamm money dude, you are so close to seeing the forest through the trees.  You&#39;re literally looking for a technicality when it clearly shows that there&#39;s a paper trail between NXIVM and DC occultists. Yes, they&#39;re occultists, they make it abundantly clear over and over again. Not to mention that this same trust got Charles Manson a new car. </p>

<p>Also, they weren&#39;t a mid-level donor, they are one of the main sponsors of the gallery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which DC occultists are they connected to?</p>

<p>How does a private payment by someone with the same surname + a donation in the year 2014/15 by an art charity imply they are working in concert?</p>

<p>To me this is an art charity doing art stuff and the daughter of someone related to the charity spending her money as she liked. The connection in payments is literally just the surname. </p>

<p>Oh, so you&#39;re just lying. Maybe if a guy in a panda mask has a painting in his gallery of a man in a panda mask abusing an amputated child, perhaps it&#39;s worth looking into. Especially if he&#39;s holding a ping pong racket in his portrait. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate this and this response lends a lot more credibility to what you are saying.</p>

<p>I&#39;m always interested in next steps, next questions to infer from a given point.</p>

<p>In this case, if I take your account as true, or want to confirm it to a higher degree of certainty, what kindof questions could I ask? </p>

<p>-do you remember the name of anyone else at the party? </p>

<p>-can you contact anyone else who might have been at the party?</p>

<p>-could you provide the address of this event? </p>

<p>i&#39;m curious about ranier, any further details about what he was like would interest me. </p>

<p>btw, have you seen the series The Girlfriend Experience?  Season 2 now seems to be written based on this stuff and pgate in general, very odd to me but really good art i think.  Top of the lake season 1 and of course True Detective season 1 also come to mind.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  The memory of the party was ultimately triggered by watching the first two episodes of &#39;Smallville&#39; which occurred around the 15th /16th of May (2018).  It was an &#39;Oh Shit&#39; moment that hit Me, the memory of the party took about a day to recall most of the details.  The Bronfmans, Salzman and James Alefantis came back to Me after I had written My statement on Github but all the better because; 1. I could use that as a &#39;bonus round&#39; of info for anyone who cared to approach Me with interest about this Party (the Truther/Citizen Journalist Community stayed completely away except for TheTanster), 2. Honestly with that line up of names how the Hell would anyone believe Me...  I am surprised No One has asked Me if Bill and Hillary Clinton were there too (they weren&#39;t).. but seriously I realize how fantastic this all is and that it sounds like I am a fan fiction writer &#39;jumping the shark,&#39; but what can I really do.  I know I am telling You all the truth, I know I&#39;d be skeptical if someone came to Me with this same statement, therein exists My dilemma..  This is why I am adamant on taking a lie detector test as I know that I will pass it.  I will even pay for half of the test I just need a couple of witnesses that will verify the legitimacy of the test and results.  How stupid would it be for Me to want to take a Lie Detector Test if there were a chance I would fail it.  A larp is a larp but that would be quite ridiculous. </p>

I make little shorts and music videos in My spare time so I recall little details like clothing and styles because it is a great way to remember, for Me.

If you had seen Abedine w alefantis during pizzgates high point this would have allowed us to make an important connection at the time.Not to mention allowed us to get a head start on stormy daniels connection.

Say an old friend brings up a random birthday or a song reminds You of something You hadn&#39;t thought about in a while, My NXIVM experience was like that.  This recollection occurred on May 15th 2018.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure there are several.  I suspect the Billionaire Canadian Couple found hanged in their Mansion may be some indicator of who the players are.  Barry and Honey Sherman had &#39;friends&#39; and they donated money as Philanthropists as well.  That would be a good avenue to start with.  Who they donated money to, who were the &#39;artists&#39; they would fund, what circles of People did they keep.  If any of this stuff were still online it would make for a Great Investigation, don&#39;t think the RCNP are doing any digging You must assume they were on the payroll, like B.C.

    <div class="md"><p>Overall it was weird, but being one of the Party People in the Greater New Haven area (which includes Hamden), I have been to some pretty bizarre functions that why I wasn&#39;t immediately too weirded out when politicians started to arrive.  I had bartender buddies that would tell Me about Quinnipiac College Events (thrown by the College itself) that had some scandalous behavior from People in certain areas of Government, stuff You would never hear about because apparently in Connecticut People are good at keeping their Mouths Shut.  i.e. Bridgeport Mayor John M. Fabrizi, Waterbury Mayor Joseph Santopietro, Waterbury Mayor Philip A. Giordano (particularly F-&#39;d Up case), Gov. John Rowland, Bridgeport Mayor Joseph P. Ganim.... the list goes on and on.  There is an organized crime syndicate running Connecticut Politics which is absolutely undeniable.  This implicates all sort of People who were involved in letting these criminals operate for as long as they did and covering up as much as they could.</p>

<p>But Yeah the Party was a little weird, in regards to the attendees I get a slight chill up My spine thinking about it and probably should have washed My hands after shaking hands with these People.</p>

Looking &#39;dumb&#39; is not My concern in all of this, My statement is a tiny peak into the inner workings of NXIVM and it seems to Me like an important thing to share with People.

    <div class="md"><p>Well #1, why come forward with this claim if you have nothing to corroborate the story with? Especially if true, seems like you&#39;d be risking a lot (including your own safety) by speaking out, and not having evidence to support your claim will mean most people won&#39;t believe you anyway. (Sorry if this has been asked elsewhere)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I appreciate people sharing info like this if it&#39;s true, but it can also hurt the overall mission if you&#39;re shown to be lying about anything.</p>

<p>Also, how&#39;d you get invited to the event exactly? And how did you learn it was an NXIVM event?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thought of exposing people to My experience seems important to Me and of interest to others, I think keeping quiet because no one would likely believe Me would be the most pointless option.  Let&#39;s say for example, all alone You saw a UFO/flying saucer pass by the nights sky.  Would You keep Your mouth shut about that just because no one else would corroborate or possibly believe what You saw?  Of Course You would tell People what You saw even at the risk of sounding crazy because what happened was extraordinary in hindsight (How could I keep this Event to myself).  Yes, I am risking My safety but I am not going to let Myself be scared into silence, it is not My nature, I know I am speaking the truth, I have done all I can to remember the order of events, the details I can recall and who all was in attendance.  I am certainly not lying and have no intention of misleading anybody, all I can give You is My word which in todays terms means nothing to People which is understandable.  The idea of &#39;lying&#39; is not a factor to Me I have no reason to lie, nothing to gain but I am using My real name so essentially lying would put My reputation at risk which once again is non-factor as I am absolutely confident in what I am telling You and everyone else.  I am not bothered if nobody believes it, My concern is outing the People surrounding this event... whether or not anyone believes Me is neither here nor there because I am saying what I saw You can take it or leave it.  People who know Me, know I am an honest person, unfortunately You don&#39;t have this same privilege (but what can I do?).  </p>

<p>My friend was invited to the party, she invited My girlfriend who invited Me.  I got to stay because We convinced the Host that I was their ride.  The Host at the party explained that it was a NXIVM Women&#39;s Empowerment Movement Social/Mixer.  Aside from that Keith Raniere, and Eric Schneiderman explained a bit of what was going on in this &#39;movement&#39; I wish I had asked more questions but once again none of these People seemed significant at the time it was just a weird party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting interview. This would have been a few months after Stormy Daniels allegedly had her fun with Donald Trump and there she is at a cult recruitment party with some New York Democrats. All those people have the air of sleaze about them, so it does seem possible they would associate with a sex cult. Anyone else of note there, I wonder?</p>

These Yale girls are daughters of CEO&#39;s, Exec&#39;s, Grand Daughters of Judges.  It is great access for a Cult out for Money, Power and Influence.  </p>

<p>Stormy is full of crap saying she has no affiliations with NXIVM, but the NYDOJ should already know this as they seized (hopefully) all of NXIVM&#39;s files.  If the NYDOJ has all the files I should be on a list of People that attended the Party that night.  It will be in Huma&#39;s handwriting.</p>
