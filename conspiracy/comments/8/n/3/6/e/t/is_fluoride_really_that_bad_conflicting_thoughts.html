        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recently watched a documentary on Fluoride, and I gotta say it convinced me that it should not be added to the water supply, and any potential positives seem to be greatly outweighed by the negatives of it. </p>

<p>After doing some research though, it seems that having that opinion automatically deems you to be &quot;crazy&quot; and the general consensus seems to be that fluoride is perfectly safe as long the amounts aren&#39;t excessive. </p>

<p>Even if that is the case though, after Flint and other towns got lead filled water, how i can truly trust that my water supply suddenly won&#39;t ever reach unsafe levels? If i&#39;m drinking, cooking, brushing, and bathing with Fluoride everyday for the rest of my life it seems a little ridiculous for me to think it won&#39;t have any affect at all. Not to mention the fact that plants/gardens don&#39;t need it, and can even be damaging to them. </p>

<p>At the very least I think people should have a choice. It appears to me that there are so many ways to get fluoride besides water that intentionally adding it seems to be overkill especially since it occurs naturally in most water sources anyway.</p>

<p>Anyway enough of me ranting. I&#39;d love to just hear some peoples thoughts on it, and any studies/articles would be cool too, especially more recent ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The effects are long term (decades). </p>

<p>We discussed you allergies to it. I&#39;ve added a theory. The F- may be acting as an adjuvant to your actual allergen. F- is used in some drugs to make the drug more potent (maybe it helps in its transport, I don&#39;t really know biochemistry). You might do an test for food allergies and other common allergies. </p>

<p>I do think it has topical benefits. Any benefits by ingestion are orders of magnitude lower, so not very significant. Slowly sipping a cup of tea over an hr+ could count as topical application though. If were a regular brusher years ago you&#39;ve probably built up a good layer of fluorapatite and are good for some time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m the one who had the allergic reaction (breaking out in a terrible rash on face) from the toothpaste. That is why I stopped using fluoride toothpaste a few years ago. But, like you said in other comments, it could have been a bad batch of toothpaste that had more fluoride than other tubes.</p>

<p>And yes, I&#39;ve read that fluoride is bad for our pineal gland too.</p>

<p>But I didn&#39;t want OP to think fluoride would kill a person, because I don&#39;t think it will do that!</p>

<p>Lastly, yes, I was a good brusher with fluoride toothpaste for 40 or so years before I had that reaction. So my teeth are good. 😀</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those that use normal toothpaste there is no need significant benefit to ingesting fluoride in their diet, and there are long term risks in fluoride ingestion at targeted doses (2 mg/day). </p>

<p>There are pretty clear long term risks when the dosing goes wrong, say ~5mg/day (which it often does). </p>

<p>Assuming there were significant benefits (which there aren&#39;t), city water would be a very poor way to distribute and dose fluoride. </p>

<p>Distribution:  ~1% actually goes into foods. The other 99% goes to fluoridate your laundry, your garden, and to flush turds down the toilet. Why not just have people swallow the entire toothpaste they use in a day (people ingesting fluoride by city water are exposing themselves to a higher dose). Or recommend that they sip a cup or two of tea a day (tea is high fluoride around 2-3 ppm, sometimes more sometimes less). </p>

<p>Dosing:   Athletes will drink twice to several times as much as a sedentary person (thus unknowingly doses himself by half an order of magnitude more of F-) Your choice of cooking can have a huge impact on fluoride; it&#39;s an evaporite element, meaning that if you for example prepare a pot of rice, the entire contents of the water used ends up in the prepared rice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mass forced medication should be illegal. What&#39;s the point of saying we have freedom? Does the government keep track of my personal water consumption? Do they know how much water I use in the shower? Maybes I soak in a bath. Do they know if I use fluoridated toothpaste? Doctors use to recommend cigarettes to patients. Studies proved that it was perfectly healthy. We know now that that&#39;s untrue. They also used to diagnose women with &quot;female hysteria&quot; and would treat them with dildos. Why would you put so much faith in an industry that has a history of being manipulated by big money ignorants? Enough faith to allow a neurotoxin to be added to drinking water. I live somewhere that doesn&#39;t have it. My teeth are fine and nobody&#39;s complaining about the lack of fluoride in the water. </p>

<p>What effect are you looking for, and does that effect exist in countries that fluoridinate vs those that don&#39;t florodonadiddlydoo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without presenting any facts run this little thought exercise. Do you think the government cares so deeply for your dental health that they can justify forcibly medicating you through a resource you require to stay alive. And if they do how come I can go to the corner store and buy cigarettes and alcohol which I&#39;d say have been studied enough at this point to know these things are bad for you.  To take this mental exercise a little further why are they not putting vitamins in the water to head of any deficiencies you might experience or why not add a plethora of other medications to the water that could &quot;potentially&quot; head off future illnesses. Does it really come down to &quot;the government cares so much about you and your dental health that you are being medicated without your consent. If in the end you truly think that is the case then you wont have any problem with the forced vaccinations that are on the docket. We are cattle to the ones who push these policies or at least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve come to believe.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m shocked that there are still people who believe that fluoride is needed for dental health. As far as I remember school lessons, dental tissue consist not of fluoride, but mostly of calcium and phosphorus.</p>

<p>I stopped using toothpaste and mouthwash with fluoride. My hypothyroidism disappeared shortly afterward. I also stopped drinking black and green tea, since they contain a lot of fluoride, and now I use toothpaste with calcium citrate.</p>
