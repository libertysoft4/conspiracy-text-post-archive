        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s already been shown, months ago, that the DNC computers (and various voting machines) had been accessed by other domestic computers. There&#39;s no evidence included in the indictment other than what Meuller says they found, and there&#39;s nothing showing that they &quot;hacked&quot; or &quot;manipulated&quot; our elections in any way.</p>

<p>Does anyone here think that &quot;The Russians&quot; would even be capable of this without the NSA/CIA knowing at the time? They have more covert cyber capability than our own agencies?</p>

<p>It&#39;s also been shown that our own three-letter agencies and those of another shitty little Mid-East country can easily mimic an originating hack or email or whatever as being from another country, as if that would even be necessary in this &quot;because we say so&quot; indictment. A nice bonus is that now the Russians can be blamed for Seth Rich. Yeah, they really wanted him gone, with all his efforts on voting accessibility, LO fuckin L.</p>

<p>Anything that comes out of the MSM that makes Russia an enemy can be called into question, because Putin/Russia have never come out to call the U.S. an &quot;enemy&quot; – other than to mention how fucked-up our foreign policy is. It&#39;s that simple.The fact that Wolf Blitzer got John Podesta on the phone to comment is fucking in-your-face absurd.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also nice cover for Imran Awan, DWS, the Clintons and everyone else who have guilt written all over them and have been screaming &quot;RUSSIA&quot; for months. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia has successfully put an agent of Russia at the top of the American food chain who has in 18 months- destroyed the idea of America as a friend to many nations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even Putin acknowledged that there is no point in doing this since the Deep State&#39;s policies don&#39;t change with the administrations. A.K.A more war, regime change, surveillance. </p>

<p>America is the #1 imperial power and is quite hated almost everywhere. You know, because of all of the regime change operations and millions of people dying and losing their homes because of us. No biggie though let&#39;s just blame Russia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The breaking up of nato, the un humans rights and security councils are all things that Russia has wanted for years and America is giving it to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean the NATO that has been expanding east, conducting war games on Russia&#39;s border, and funded violent revolutions, including arming neo Nazis, in Ukraine?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>North Korea has been elevated onto the world stage for what? The withdrawal of American troops and more nuclear bombs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The one thing the Trump Admin gets right (for now at least) and you find a way to shove in your cognitive dissonance into. Amazing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are witnessing the end of America as a force for good and for right and the resurgence of Russia and China as the true world superpowers. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This right here confirms that you are a sh- I mean useful idiot. &#39;Force for good and for right?&#39; Please tell that to the millions of people dead in the following countries we invaded for no good reason: Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Ukraine, Somalia, Ethiopia, and let&#39;s not forget the current genocide in Yemen where we&#39;re fuelling Saudi&#39;s ships and giving them military support.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is shameful, criminal and treasonous. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, your entire outlook is shameful, criminal, and treasonous. I am absolutely disgusted if this is actually what you think.</p>

<p>Nice, you&#39;re now twisting my words in a pathetic attempt to salvage your &quot;points.&quot;</p>

<p>Putin&#39;s (valid) point was that the Deep State will march on regardless. Let&#39;s assume that big meanie Drumpf is a Russian Manchurian Candidate. So far, he has done nothing but push the policies of his Neo-Con, Zionist, and Military Industrial Complex-infested administration.... just like the ones before him. Wow!</p>

<p>Before you inevitably say something about &quot;muh sanctions,&quot; they are extremely unpopular in Europe because it would make them rely on the much more expensive American gas. </p>

<p>agents within the FBI preventing the DNC from hacking the voting machines  </p>

<p>The claim was actually DHS Cybersecurity. The alleged hacking consisted of injecting custom code to change vote-weighting parameters in favor of Clinton (yes, Diebold machines really have vote-weighting parameters. Why?!?). Even better, these intrusions were masked as Russian-based cyber attacks in case they got caught. Now we see Plan B is well underway.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a point because Russians didn&#39;t hack the DNC.  Seth Rich was the <em>leakers</em>, and he was killed for it.

<p>Nothing was hacked.  The DNC refusal to turn their servers over to the FBI pretty much seals that one.  Seth Rich worked for the DNC and provided the info to Wikileaks, probably because Rich was a Bernie Sanders supporter.</p>

<p>Interesting you should mention this standard. Literally the only Trump directed change to the RNC platform was a softening of the stance on US assistance to Ukraine. You&#39;re aware of Crimea&#39;s strategic importance re:  Russia and NATO as one of Russia&#39;s few potential warm water ports. Manafort is of course in serious legal trouble over his decade of work on behalf of pro-Russian elements in Ukraine. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because I was in the military when it happened.  From a strategic standpoint, the loss of the Panama Canal is huge.</p>

<p>Noting even remotely compared to the strategics loss of the Panama Canal.  Do you even realize if China wanted they could block us from using it?  Did you know it would then take us 21 days to get our east coast ships to the west coast?  Am I supposed to liken that to reducing the amount of proxy conflicts we get into?</p>

<p>How can you honestly believe this?! Trump himself admitted that he only said this kind of shit to rile you guys up. He straight up told you to your face that he played you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump said Friday he doesn&#39;t care about prosecuting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, after attendees at his rally chanted &quot;lock her up.&quot;</p>

<p>After the chants started at the President-elect&#39;s post-election &quot;thank you&quot; rally in Michigan, he responded, &quot;That plays great before the election -- now we don&#39;t care, right?&quot;</p>

<p>However, once Trump became President-elect, he said he wouldn&#39;t recommend prosecution of Clinton, whom he told New York Times reporters has &quot;suffered greatly.&quot;</p>

<p>He also said the idea of prosecuting Clinton is &quot;just not something I feel very strongly about.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really should dig into the facts of Uranium One. They operate primarily in Canada, Kazakhstan, and other countries. A small portion of their business is in the US.  Also, Russia has been producing shit-tons of nuclear weapons since the 1950s, never needing this one specific company to do so. </p>

<p>Your comment implies that Russia is without nuclear capability if they could not acquire Uranium One, which is false. It implies Uranium One was significantly tied to uranium sourced from the US, which is false.  It implies that Hillary Clinton personally &quot;handed over&quot; control of Uranium One to Russia, which is false.</p>

<p>Moreover, the FBI and <em>Republican-lead</em> congressional investigations have found no fault in Hillary Clinton for anything tied to Uranium One.  I will tell you why: the whole thing was a <em>narrative</em>. The truth or falsity of the allegations wasn&#39;t the point. The point was to push a narrative of scandal, to harm Clinton politically.</p>

<p>Uranium One was inconsequential to Russia&#39;s interest in backing a 2016 candidate. They had something much more important: a candidate who would praise and never criticize Putin, who would accept Russia&#39;s annexation of Crimea, who would disrupt the NATO alliance, and who would work back channels for possibly darker things, the details of which are not yet fully known.</p>

<p>Right, so not only does the Deep State conspiracy consist of numerous career professionals across many agencies of government, it <em>also</em> includes the Democrats (obviously), <em>and</em> it includes the Republicans as well. And, for some reason, they all wanted Russia to have more uranium to turn into nuclear weapons, because reasons.</p>

<p>But Uranium One was only involved at a small scale in the US. It&#39;s primary operations are located elsewhere, and all relevant officials of the other countries also approved the sale. I suppose that means the Deep State extends to the governments of Canada and South Africa as well? </p>

<p>Weren&#39;t you the one who originally cited Occam&#39;s Razor?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the simpler explanation: the Uranium One &quot;controversy&quot; originated from hyper-partisan site Brietbart as a hit piece against Hillary Clinton and spread from there around the right-wing mediasphere. Boom, solved.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s got nothing to do with what I said. If you think Clinton was going to be soft on Russia, why defend  the alternative  who is literally doing <em>everything</em> that Putin could hope a US president would do? &quot;Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother&#39;s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can educate everyone about spearphising until you&#39;re blue in the face, but it only takes one old fart somewhere who still doesn&#39;t fully understand the internet to click a link in one email that looks like it&#39;s from Google and your system is compromised. Have you ever worked in IT security? It&#39;s inherently a game where you&#39;re at least one turn behind your attackers. You can&#39;t see the future, and therefore you can only protect against known past attack vectors, and make some creative guesses about possible future ones.</p>

<p>Writing software that is going to run on target computers (security or not)? Better hope that your software employees are all loyal, and don&#39;t sell exploits on the black market for hundreds of thousands of dollars (they do - look up Zero Day Exploits). Using third-party software? Better hope that none of their employees have sold exploits (they have).</p>

<p>If you pay any attention to security news, new bugs are found and published on a nearly daily basis. Frequently white hat hackers find them and alert the companies, only to be ignored, and then publicise them ninety days later to pressure the companies into fixing them. And those are just the tip of the iceberg. Honestly that news feed is almost as much of an anxiety recipe as conspiracy news.</p>

<p>Security is only as strong as it&#39;s weakest link, and the larger (and let&#39;s be real, older) the population of your organization is, the more exponentially weaker it is. Then factor into an election where &quot;hacking&quot; could mean any number of things and many organizations are targets, with multiple superpower state actors prodding your defenses nonstop and you have a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>In fact, right now, thousands of bots/scripts randomly scan the internet checking for servers that have unpatched software from a list of <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov">publicly known vulnerabilities</a>. My company doesn&#39;t even work in security and we get multiple bots prodding us daily.</p>

<p>All it takes is one misconfigured file, one out of date dependcy, one marginally incompetent CTO. Equifax was hacked because of one single server in Argentina that still had the default admin password.</p>

<p>They could also sweep ip addresses in the area of a desired target. I genuinely believe it is by the grace of God that wannacry has been the worst global cyber attack. </p>

<p>The idea that Obama could somehow create an iron lockdown of security is ridiculous.</p>

<p>The problem with this &quot;scandal&quot; is that there&#39;s no way to determine the magnitude of effect Russian meddling may have had on the election. And whatever the meddling is or was is pretty amorphous and hard to nail down. You can&#39;t re-run the campaign as a simulation to decide whether, minus Russian meddling, did the outcome change?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s true, but we could at least, minimally, pass legislation to help make it harder for such a thing to happen again.  We aren&#39;t even doing that.  We can investigate what happened, and if any crimes were committed, hold those accountable.  </p>

<p>We&#39;re not going to somehow re-do the election.  There&#39;s zero clause in our Constitution to do that.  If the worst is true, and Trump is personally involved in crimes, he&#39;s impeached and Mike Pence becomes President.  The Presidency doesn&#39;t fall to Hillary Clinton no matter how much liberals might bitch that it should be so.</p>

<p>And whatever the meddling is was pretty well laid out by the indictment released yesterday.  It included not only their social media campaigns, but also the illegal hack of the DNC and John Podesta, as well as hosting and providing financial assistance to rallies, and all of the crimes associated with those activities, such as identity theft of U.S. persons, bank fraud, and campaign law violations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you managed to at least discourage a couple of people from following the link, which was your only goal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think this proves the message the biased source is trying to claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The biased source? One is an actual lawsuit filed by George Webb in November of 2017. That&#39;s 9 months ago. In the lawsuit, it alleges that Awan registered the domain actblues.com (one letter different than actblue.com) in order to redirect political donations.</p>

<p>In July 2018, Meuller makes the exact same claim but says Russians did it.</p>

<p>A link to Meuller&#39;s indictment has already been provided. I provided a link to George Webb&#39;s actual lawsuit. Anyone is free to read both and compare.</p>

<p>Yeah, TruePundit is biased. But they are also correct. They didn&#39;t falsify either of these original sources, just reported on the clear comparison between the two.</p>

<p>Before I accepted their premise, I went and looked at the original Meuller document and the orginal GW lawsuit. Yep. What Truepundit claims is accurate and unmodified.</p>

<p>But then, your goal was simply to attack the source and claim it doesn&#39;t show anything to discourage people from actually looking into it. No doubt that will work on at least some people, so goal accomplished, right?</p>

<p>No. I am linking to actual documents that show that Meuller took the exact accusations that Webb made in November of 2017 and put them in his indictment document in July 2018 while claiming that Russia did it.</p>

<p>George Webb lawsuit AGAIN, filed November of 2017
<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.190971.1.0.pdf">https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.190971.1.0.pdf</a></p>

<p>Relevant paragraph is 44</p>

<p>That was based off domain registrations tracing back to the Awan brothers. Since then, Microsoft has bought the domains view a lawsuit (you can check the Whois for actblues.com and see that it is now owned by Microsoft) to cover up this fact. Here is also an article about that:
<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/microsoft-pushes-to-take-over-russian-spies-network">https://www.thedailybeast.com/microsoft-pushes-to-take-over-russian-spies-network</a></p>

<p>When George Webb filed his lawsuit in November of 2017, it was obvious who had registered actblues.com. The lawsuit had nothing to do with Russians. George Webb would have had no way of knowing that Meuller was going to make this claim in July of 2018.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post shows a pretty basic misunderstanding of what it means to &quot;hack&quot; something, or more specifically, what it means to accuse a foreign national of hacking something in the US.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend reading <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/a-leak-or-a-hack-a-forum-on-the-vips-memo/">this article from The Nation</a> about the idea that &quot;it has already been shown&quot; that the DNC computers were accessed &quot;domestically.&quot; It isn&#39;t written by a reporter, it is direct writing from three groups of people: a group of former intelligence workers that supports that conclusion, a group of former intelligence workers that disputes that conclusion, and a third party security researcher attempting to parse and confirm the claims from both sides. It is a very well done article and I recommend you read it and come to your own conclusions on who to believe.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also note that, if you read the actual indictment of the hackers, it is stated that the Russians transferred the stolen materials from the DNC and DCCC to a server hosted in Illinois (which they purchased with anonymous, fake accounts paid for via Bitcoin). </p>

<p>Lol how do you think indictments work?</p>

<p>Does anyone here think that &quot;The Russians&quot; would even be capable of this without the NSA/CIA knowing at the time? </p>

<p>Shows how uninformed you are. The American intelligence knew this was happening. Both John Brennan and Obama confronted the Russians about it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also been shown that our own three-letter agencies and those of another shitty little Mid-East country can easily mimic an originating hack or email or whatever as being from another country</p>

<p>This is the funniest part about those bitching that we haven&#39;t seen evidence. There&#39;s no evidence you&#39;d accept anyways. No matter what is presented, you&#39;ll call it fake because deep down you just know it had to be the JEWS.</p>

<p>A nice bonus is that now the Russians can be blamed for Seth Rich.</p>

<p>Pretty sure most same folks will continue blaming a botched robbery.</p>

<p>The three components for finding guilt in any crime are means, motive and opportunity. I think all three are in question here, but especially &quot;motive&quot; for the Russians</p>

<p>You fucking kidding me? The motive could not be more obvious.</p>

<p>At best these names will end up on some shitlist the State Department maintains, preventing them from vacationing in Miami or visiting Disneyworld, but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>Hillary loyalists will use these indictments to further their own biases and whatever you call the opposite side will use their irrelevance for furthering their own biases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean MAYBE... maybe this is true, I find it absolutely unlikely for two reasons. Reason number one is the timing, these people will throw their own kid under the bus if it made Trump somehow look bad. Secondly, isn’t this again about the DNC and Hillary’s unsecured email server? So she’s not reliable for using an unsecured server, because that’s irrelevant and she just made a silly mistake and didn’t know any better, yeah okay, but hacking her unsecured server is not okay, but her having it is? There’s a reason there is encrypted emails for people in her position... that’s like a Hockey or Football player deciding he doesn’t need to wear a cup protecting his testicles, and then the opposite team injured his testies, and it’s totally not the fault of the player for not wearing mandatory regulation protective equipment; it’s the fault of the other player for playing their advantage? Ridiculous. Yea 12 Russian agents put Trump in the White House, it certainly wasn’t the Arenas full of people he was drawing in every state.</p>

<p>The problem with this &quot;scandal&quot; is that there&#39;s no way to determine the magnitude of effect Russian meddling may have had on the election. And whatever the meddling is or was is pretty amorphous and hard to nail down. You can&#39;t re-run the campaign as a simulation to decide whether, minus Russian meddling, did the outcome change?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s true, but we could at least, minimally, pass legislation to help make it harder for such a thing to happen again.  We aren&#39;t even doing that.  We can investigate what happened, and if any crimes were committed, hold those accountable.  </p>

<p>We&#39;re not going to somehow re-do the election.  There&#39;s zero clause in our Constitution to do that.  If the worst is true, and Trump is personally involved in crimes, he&#39;s impeached and Mike Pence becomes President.  The Presidency doesn&#39;t fall to Hillary Clinton no matter how much liberals might bitch that it should be so.</p>

<p>And whatever the meddling is was pretty well laid out by the indictment released yesterday.  It included not only their social media campaigns, but also the illegal hack of the DNC and John Podesta, as well as hosting and providing financial assistance to rallies, and all of the crimes associated with those activities, such as identity theft of U.S. persons, bank fraud, and campaign law violations.</p>
