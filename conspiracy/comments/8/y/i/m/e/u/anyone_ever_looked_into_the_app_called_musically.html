        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For some reason I keep getting loads of ads for this app on youtube. I decided to just search youtube to see what it was, and found this video titled &quot;What kids really do on Musical.ly&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PmphkNDosg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PmphkNDosg</a></p>

<p>It seems like it&#39;s just a bunch of young teens (13, 14 etc), dancing/singing and making sexual signs and acts with their hands/mouth on video.</p>

<p>Probably harmless as it&#39;s just a social media app targeted to that age group. But in the above video we are shown a youtube video called &quot;FUCKBOY COMPILATION!!! EXTREMELY HOT!!!&quot; or something along those lines. </p>

<p>Which includes a bunch of young boys dancing in sexual manners etc. </p>

<p>I have no idea where I&#39;m going to this, but it seems like a Pedo&#39;s dream. And the whole app to me just seems pretty fucked up and as if it probably shouldn&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>Anyone looked into this at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same age group, I remember all the drama SM caused growing up, the bullying, shit talking and fights generated from it, but we were all so scared to be overly sexual on there because Chris Hansen might show up at your door. Now kids basically lose their innocence before they even have a chance. And I cannot stand seeing these children with iPads and iPhones, I see it all the time, I mean I had a gameboy but I was linked to the world on it. It’s all a plot trickling down and just seems to be more evident than ever we are so easy to have our strings pulled </p>

<p>Oh so you&#39;re just another loser that comes here to not discuss conspiracies but comment on posts you disagree with and shit on them because you can&#39;t people discuss things without them knowing your irrelevant opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I installed musically once before I heard anything about it. I&#39;m a musician, so part of the hustle is trying to find any possible place people might be receptive to music, so I usually try any service that is tangentially related to music. I sign up, create a profile, and start browsing to figure out how people use the service so I make appropriate stuff and I&#39;m bombarded by videos of extremely young girls engaging in sexualized behavior. I immediately realized that this was fucked up and absolutely no place for me and deleted the app. In like the couple of minutes I had it I literally could not run a single search of see a single thing that didn&#39;t have sexualized content in it.

    <div class="md"><p>Tv and social media are hardly the reason people aren&#39;t more self-sufficient and/or active in their community. </p>

<p>There are plenty of ways to put gardening knowledge into practice, but to be self-sufficient from it when roughly 50% of the population live in urban cities? 40% of those live in densely populated areas. Plus, you&#39;ve gotta worry about climate, which for a good portion of the world population means canning and preserves. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it can be done, but why would I spend all of my non-work hours cultivating, growing, feeding, sowing, canning, preserving? Unless it was a community thing, but then we&#39;ve gotta account for the ones not sharing the workload and balancing the reality that you&#39;ve gotta keep your 1 kid fed, but the Smiths have 5 children and so of course they should put more into the process. And who gives up what when the weather changes and we don&#39;t have a decent haul for the year? Etc etc</p>

<p>We&#39;re &#39;more interested in our next selfie&#39; because society and humankind got beyond the need to be self-sufficient, at least is developed nations. </p>

My daughters have phones/tablets and they are only 7 and 8 (phones are against my wishes!) and they wanted this app, until I seen a dude from Germany watching them and jerking off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took dance growing up for 12 years actually. So sometimes I like to watch dances on YouTube. There&#39;s a lot of really inappropriate ones in terms of moves or costumes or both and I don&#39;t understand how everyone was okay with it from the parents to the teachers and sometimes I wonder who&#39;s running the dance competitions where it&#39;s almost encouraged. It&#39;s also hard to find anyone who critiques it.</p>
