        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi all</p>

<p>I am writing this sort of for the record and for any hopes that I will get useful advices from people who perhaps found themselves in the same boat as me.</p>

<p>Let me begin with saying that I have always tried to be as discreet as I possibly can online. Namely, I do not mention any personal information about myself online, also I have deleted all my social media accounts 2 years ago. </p>

<p>Today I stumbled on a news post on r/worldnews about palestine, and I found a comment that was clearly trying to discredit the death of a palestinian in a manner that seemed to me highly propagandic (if that is a real word). So I knew it was Hasbara (Israeli internet force), and I just said &quot;Hi Hasbara&quot;. An hour later <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/appdevil">appdevil</a> responded with &quot;Hello Ahmed.&quot;. Now that is my real first name. You can not track me down through any conventional methods solely from my reddit account, and I would like to see someone try and see if that is possible. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/EVOon1Y">Screenshot of the incident</a></p>

<p>Thank you for reading, I will be more discreet next time and I will abandon this account. Do you have any input? am I paranoid? or is this the real thing?</p>

<p>TLDR: I commented &quot;Hi Hasbara&quot; to an israeli apologetic post and they replied with &quot;Hello (then my real name)&quot; which is hard to obtain through conventional internet creepy knowledge. </p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t they guess Mohammed, Hamed, Mahamed, Umed, Romed,,,, why would it be an arabic name why wouldn&#39;t they guess James, Jamal, Jameal, blah blah</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you ran into a smart ass. </p>

<p>I have some hard hitting anti-Jewish and anti-Zionists writings. I go after their behaviors alot.  About the worst that&#39;s happened to me was a series of e mails from three individuals gaslighting me and suggesting &quot;I seek mental help.&quot; Incredibly all of these e mails were honest enough to give their names- which I was able to look up. I actually appreciated this open and not underhanded sneaky method. </p>

<p>About all I run into is snarkiness and banning. I know there is a lot of self censorship around Jewish issues, but they can&#39;t afford to go after people for what you did- it would never end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro he didn’t delete the post...the mods did. Go to his comment history &amp; you’ll see his comment is still there. </p>

<p>Anyway they pay individuals to spread Hasbara. Also to harass and discredit any opposing comments. For awhile on twitter some fake Israeli profile would comment on my tweets in regards to Palestine. So I decided to DM him. I asked him if he could kindly take my username off whatever database he’s using to spread his hasbara. He thought it was funny &amp; never harassed me again.  </p>
