        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>I&#39;m posting this again and will reply with specific examples, tough to do right now as I&#39;m on airplane wifi via my phone.</em></p>

<p>Also I want to make clear I have no interest in debating whether it exists or specifically by who, this is macro view of the subject, not a he said she said slapfight</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been coming to this board for three years, I&#39;ve been on Reddit for 7 years and 4chan for the same. I only say that to prove context to this belief.</p>

<p>While pedophilia is objectively one of the worst sins in humanity, no one refutes that, I believe this board and right-wingers have latched on to it because it typically implicates Hilary Clinton and perceived liberal entertainers. </p>

<p>Not only do I believe that, but for all these individuals who supposedly care so deeply, I don&#39;t see anybody tangibly doing anything about it. I&#39;ve seen a few alt-right marches and rallies in the UK and US but those were shams to make a bigger conservative point (anti Muslim mainly). For example there are quite a few members of the US House taking action (Rep Wagner) to directly combat sex trafficking, but yet I never see pro-action continued coverage or attention to causes that is not comingled with a bigger point (typically anti Hillary or Democrat). Even though I detest the posters and rules, I frequently window shop on t_d to have a full view of things and the same stands.</p>

<p>I am positive there are a few examples here and there, but this board has pizzagate/pedo posts fill up at least 1/4 of the board for the past 2 years (and I know the nature of this board isn&#39;t to promote solutions) but observing a large amount of right wing social media I wholly stand by this point. </p>

<p>I say this as someone who worked in a clinic years back in law school who had to deal with this stuff directly. Im in no way a white knight but its disgusting to me that this issue is used to score points and not even a sliver of people here promote causes or take an overt action to do anything outside of tarnish those who are politically opposite. So change my view that even a tenth of the energy and attention concocting theories and suspects and supposed evidence goes towards anything positive or to remedy and better the situation.</p>

<p>TL;Dr: The obsession with pedo rings is disgusting in that it&#39;s purely to further a political view of an objectively grotesque crime. The right puts so much energy in it for political points against the Democratic establishment and liberal media personalities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is used to forum slide.  That&#39;s why you&#39;ll often see ridiculous hysterics over a symbol.  A symbol that never seems to lead to anything.  This topic will be down voted hard because those that control this board want this.  That way real topics, topics that have an impact on our lives, aren&#39;t as discussed.  The manipulation is at times very high.  It depends on the traction of other topics.  I believe pizzagate exists mostly because the majority of kid fucking happening among the elite, are underage, not children.  If everyone is up in arms about a child ring that doesn&#39;t exist, people like epstein who went after girls in their young teens.  It&#39;s often used to confirm pizzagate, but no one bothers to ever talk about the major difference.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes, you need to get the word out before you can remedy a situation. You can&#39;t have people propose a solution to a problem they don&#39;t know exists. I agree there are a lot of unnecessary partisan angles that are played, but the moral responsibility to bring to light elite pedophelia on either side of the political spectrum should hopefully supercede any political goals. </p>

<p>An excellent way to bury any discussion regarding pizzagate/pedogate/elite pedophelia is to claim the entire discussion is the result of political biases, when that&#39;s not necessarily true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very solid points on raising awareness. What, though would you say are the solutions? Is it politically risky for anyone to take a hard line stance or enact tougher laws on this topic? Trafficking is as old as time, though I totally agree people probably aren&#39;t versed on the form we know it today.</p>

<p>While I definitely am with you on the first part, I wholeheartedly disagree that a critical look at what&#39;s behind it is a form to shut it down. Again no one is dying on the hill to defend it or the people, why would anyone shut it down? The perps themselves are left right center so no ones protecting their side in shutting it down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The solutions will arise from public acceptance of the information discussed. Until people acknowledge the issue is real, there will be no solution. I would imagine these characters should be removed from the general public, but to what extent would likely depend upon a states&#39; views. </p>

<p>I understand your thinking when you conclude that there is no real motivation to shut down discussion of the topic, in that you cite that there are perpetrators all over the political spectrum, but I feel that may only address the desire to stifle this conversation for strictly political reasons, and that this view may inadvertently overlook the notion that these people would want to hide for moral/personal reasons. (might have misunderstood what you meant contextually by saying &quot;critical look&quot; though)</p>

<p>Apart from the political scandal that would arise from the revelation of their pedophelia, it&#39;s also a culturally abhorred practice that would destroy one&#39;s personal and professional reputation. I could see anyone (left, right center, above, below etc) who messes around with kids wanting to stifle any discussion of the subject, even if it meant that stifling may inadvertently &quot;protect&quot; someone on &quot;the other team.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest question, did you read the text of my post? Not only did I not start this 18 months ago, I stated the nuance in coverage and attention as my point of contention. At no point did I even faintly imply, mention, or insinuate I don&#39;t believe it as widespread and problematic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did, yes.  I &quot;enjoyed&quot; such nuggets as:</p>

<p>&quot;I believe this board and right-wingers have latched on to it because it typically implicates Hilary Clinton and perceived liberal entertainers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The obsession with pedo rings is disgusting in that it&#39;s purely to further a political view of an objectively grotesque crime&quot;</p>

<p>Which were both news to me.  I guess I&#39;m a non-entity?</p>

<p>If you want to create an OP about how the Right is using PG, go for it.  But what you did here was castigate those who follow PG as partisan.  Vastly different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted this a while back. It is the one thing I absolutely hate about this sub. </p>

<p>The part that people seem to not see, even though we are on a conspiracy sub, is that this all started up during an election. And it really only made one political side and their supporters look bad. That doesn&#39;t make you pause for a minute and think, &quot;am I part of a psy-op put out there by a political strategist?&quot;. </p>

<p>My biggest issue with it though is that all of these people who supposedly want to take out pedo&#39;s aren&#39;t doing anything about it. They are posting shit on Reddit to try and prove a theory. If they really wanted to take out pedo&#39;s, they could easily go online, pose as a minor, get some scumbag to start talking to them, get them to send dick pics, set up a meeting, then once the pedo get&#39;s there, have the film crew ready. Then, turn it all into the police. People all over the world do the &quot;To Catch a Predator&quot; shit daily but they won&#39;t do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One recent sickening sequence that reinforces your thesis was the campaign to claim that homeless camp in Tucson was in fact a child trafficking site (based on no evidence). Almost immediately following this, the zero tolerance policy took hold and so many kids were taken away from their parents by our government, and this was often defended. </p>

<p>The clincher, though, was 19 ICE officials and agents proposing the disillusion of ICE into a strict border/immigration enforcement force and an international crime task force...why? </p>

<p>Because dealing with the fallout of Trump admin policies was taking resources away from the crime unit, which covers things such as cartels and Child Trafficking. That letter and concept didn&#39;t make any appearances on this sub that I observed.</p>
