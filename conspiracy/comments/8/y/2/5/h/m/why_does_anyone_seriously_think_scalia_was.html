        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Seriously, we&#39;re talking about a 79-year-old overweight smoker with an insanely high-stress job who had half a dozen chronic conditions, any of which could have caused his natural death. He also wasn&#39;t wearing his CPAP mask when he was found, meaning he could have suffocated due to sleep apnea. </p>

<p>And the evidence for his &quot;murder&quot; is...what? That he had part of a pillow case over his eyes? Some dopey email from John Podesta?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, then that is why nobody did an autopsy. It wasn&#39;t considered an unexpected death with extenuating circumstances.</p>

<p>When people die suddenly in hotel rooms with pillows over their faces, the police don&#39;t rule out homicide so quickly.</p>

<p>Well, not usually, anyway.</p>

<p>The news is literally filled with investigations into cause of death of normal, everyday people found dead.</p>
