<p>Yea, must be nice to have such amazing social programs when you only have to spend 0.5% of your GDP on defense spending thanks to countries like the US. How wonderful!</p>

<p>You accuse me of spouting propaganda, when you </p>

<p>A. Don&#39;t live in this country.</p>

<p>B. Have never used our healthcare system.</p>

<p>and C. Are using LITERAL PROPAGANDA to make your arguments!</p>

<p>Also, why do so many people travel to America to recieve specialized treatments, surgeries, cancer treatments, etc.?</p>

<p>Why is it that all of the BEST doctors in the world come to America to practice?</p>

<p>I love how many European socialists feel the need to weigh in on America&#39;s healthcare system. If you want your &quot;awesome healthcare system&quot;, then great! Go nuts! But stop trying to convince everyone that they should be more like you.</p>

<p>The fact is, you have ZERO background in economics. I don&#39;t care what your HSE propaganda promotes, the system you&#39;re advocating for (for Americans, for some reason) is completely unsustainable for a country of our size, and a government of our level of corruption.</p>

<p>Just because you bend over for the government, doesn&#39;t mean we should too. If people can&#39;t afford care, we should help them through charity and volunteer work... not at the end of a gun from big government.</p>

<p>A. I have lived i america</p>

<p>B. I have used your healthcare system</p>

<p>And C. absolutely i am using propaganda. </p>

<p>SO are you when you argue it wouldn&#39;t work. You are arguing in favor of a high cost to medical care which benefits guess who? big Pharma, Insurance companies and a host of other parties with lobbyists and a narrative that cheap affordable healthcare would not work.</p>

<p>To move onto your arguements you state that the best doctors in the world people come for treatment etc etc. And your right thats true.</p>

<p>Know what your missing though? All these amazing things are not available to the average american. All those things are available to the wealthy american, not your working class, not your underclasses or lower middle class.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>stop trying to convince everyone they should be more like you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Says the cannibal to the missionary.</p>

<p>If i see injustice or things that I believe and know to be wrong I will call them out. Your healthcare system is seriously flawed and leaves people in crippling debt or afraid to use for fear of debt. Mine does not.</p>

<p>As for Defence spending The UK spends alot on defence and yet they have the NHS.</p>

<p>and for your last point you are right. I have no background in economics. But WHAT THE FUCK do economics have to do with not letting people die in the wealthiest nation on earth? Seriously? Its going to burden the wealthiest of us too much? Sounds like republican propaganda to me.....</p>

<p>Healthcare should be available to all at the expense of the state and taxes. When you face then end of that gun you should be taken to the nearest hospital, not the cheapest one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t listen to him.  It&#39;s absolutely possible if we choose to allocate our tax money differently than we are.  He throws keynes&#39; name out there to try to impress you but it has little to nothing to do with whether or not the government can afford public healthcare. </p>

<p>Forget for a second that we already pay $400-$500 per month per person for private healthcare in this country, that would go away with public option.  Maybe the government, with all its inefficiencies, can manage to budget that program to a breakeven by tapping into that enormous profit that the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries generate.  They would actually be able to increase inefficiencies in cost of goods and services provided by using bulk discount negotiating that smaller private general hospitals and healthcare providers cannot do.  </p>

<p>So forget all that, because after all, this boils down to an issue of how we are allocating the money we are all paying in taxes, our national budget.  It&#39;s got nothing to with fiscal policy, as mr. Keyne&#39;s namedopper up there is saying.  Leading economic theory in the most effective ways to influence the factors contributing to GDP is going to dictate how much tax revenue we generate within our existing tax structure. You and I are talking about national public healthcare, a use of those funds.  This does not take money out of our economy, and should tend to have the opposite effect.  </p>

<p>We spent $8 trillion on US wars and regime changes overseas since 9/11.  $8 trillion.  All the people are asking for is a slice of the military and national defense spending to make this happen.  Hell we probably don&#39;t even need it, considering the increase in tax revenue by taking our private insurance premiums and calling it healthcare tax.  But how scary would it be if we were only leading in military spending by 4 times the next closest nation?  Anyone feel like that would put our country at risk?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you name me another area of commerce where a heavily government controlled and regulated system outperforms the free market? I&#39;d be very curious to know. </p>

<p>From my experience, the most costly, over-inflated, poorly run systems are all the ones with the most government intervention (banking, education, insurance, health care, auto manufacturing, hell even parcel delivery, etc.)</p>

<p>What makes you think the government would all of a sudden be able to get its shit together enough to properly and efficiently run a system as massive as universal healthcare??? We already know for a fact that the government is filled with shady siphons which drain taxpayer dollars from virtually all areas of government spending. Do you really think that this would not IMMEDIATELY occur when implementing something like this?</p>

<p>We need to be <em>removing</em> power from the federal government, not <strong>drastically</strong> expanding it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d have to do some research since universal healthcare is the most obvious example.</p>

<p>The fact pretty much every other first world nation can manage it with a lower GDP, combined with the fact the current American system costs more for worse health outcomes.</p>

<p>We can talk about how in theory the free market should provide a better healthcare service but the facts really don&#39;t back that up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no typically a huge Peter Schiff fan, but he makes some super valid and great points when he was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSE_dNKVrGs">last on the JRE podcast</a>. Government regulation is to blame, not free market economics.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What about the fact that these countries don&#39;t need to pay to secure their own borders, thanks to the US military and things like NATO? They barely spend 1% of their GDPs on military expenditures, because the US acts as the worlds police (not saying I&#39;m a fan of that by any means). It&#39;s easy for them to have vastly expensive social programs when they don&#39;t need to worry about military. Just look at our budget... over 65% of it is already occupied by social programs like medicare and medicaid. People talk about how much we spend on defense spending, but that&#39;s because SOMEBODY has to, don&#39;t they?</p>

<p>(For the record, I&#39;m in no way set in this way of thinking, and would be interested to hear any flaws you see in that argument. I&#39;m still a little shaky on the specifics.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you not think it&#39;s suspicious that all the other first world countries have healthcare systems that are statistically superior to the American system yet the country with the highest GDP in the world has been convinced they can&#39;t afford it, despite the fact their current system costs them dramatically more than other countries?</p>

<p>Or that the supposed reasons it would be impossible to implement such a system in the US are all entirely self-imposed by the government, like being the world police?</p>

<p>Or that even most <em>developing</em> nations have some form of universal healthcare these days?</p>

<p>You pivoted from &quot;it doesn&#39;t work&quot; to &quot;it wouldn&#39;t work here&quot; as soon I brought up the fact universal healthcare is statistically more effective for less money, does this mean you tacitly acknowledged that universal healthcare provides better outcomes?</p>

<p>Notice how arguments against universal healthcare rely on rhetoric whereas arguments for universal healthcare rely on actual healthcare data. Notice how the rhetoric revolves around the idea universal healthcare is expensive when the American system costs dramatically more.</p>

<p>It&#39;s especially suspicious when the &quot;reasons&quot; America can&#39;t have universal healthcare are also sort of backhanded compliments to America, like saying they can&#39;t afford it because all the other countries rely on them or because they&#39;re too &quot;free&quot; for such a system.</p>

<p>In reality America could implement such a system, and if it couldn&#39;t that is a sign the country is deeply broken in a way none of its peers are.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing &quot;suspicious&quot; about simple economics. It&#39;s not a coincidence that most of the greatest advancements in medical science in the last century have come out of our system. Had we all just been like &quot;other first world countries&quot;, who would be innovating??? Where&#39;s the incentive to create new drugs and tech when the government is just going to tell <em>you</em> how much they will pay for it?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason we left Europe. There&#39;s a reason we&#39;ve becoming the greatest economy the world has ever seen. There&#39;s a reason why medical advancement&#39;s happen here more than anywhere else. That reason, is free market capitalism, and the competition created by it.</p>

<p>Longer life expectancy, less people dying of preventable causes, less money spent, that sort of thing.</p>

<p>So for example I&#39;d say the US has statistically superior cancer treatments (for most forms of cancer, I think there are one or two exceptions)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/quality-u-s-healthcare-system-compare-countries/">Here&#39;s</a> a source with a lot of comparisons. Not sure if it deals with cost.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that the country with the highest GDP can afford to subsidise more research or that big pharma would focus their research in a nation where they can set their own astronomical prices for drugs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s nothing &quot;suspicious&quot; about simple economics.</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely suspicious when &quot;simple economics&quot; don&#39;t hold up to reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Had we all just been like &quot;other first world countries&quot;, who would be innovating???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The USA, only more Americans would benefit from these innovations instead of subsidising them through taxation and then having to pay an uncapped price for the drugs anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where&#39;s the incentive to create new drugs and tech when the government is just going to tell <em>you</em> how much they will pay for it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then there should be precisely zero medical innovations from countries with universal healthcare?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a reason we left Europe. There&#39;s a reason we&#39;ve becoming the greatest economy the world has ever seen. There&#39;s a reason why medical advancement&#39;s happen here more than anywhere else. That reason, is free market capitalism, and the competition created by it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a reason Americans live short, sick lives compared to their European counterparts. There&#39;s a reason Americans are dying of preventable causes. There&#39;s a reason the ruling class don&#39;t want you to support universal healthcare.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason so many Americans resort to Americans Exceptionalism delusions when faced with uncomfortable truths about their country. Stops them from objectively comparing America to its peers and realising they&#39;ve been fed a crock of shit about policies like universal healthcare.</p>

<p>Trained by the ruling class to block their ears and chant &quot;we&#39;re the best&quot; over and over, eyes closed to the facts.</p>
