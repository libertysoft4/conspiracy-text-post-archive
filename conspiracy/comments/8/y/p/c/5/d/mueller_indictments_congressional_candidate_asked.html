    <div class="md"><p>S.S.: A U.S. congressional candidate contacted Russian operatives in 2016 and successfully obtained damaging stolen information on their opponent.</p>

<p>The indictment of 12 Russian intelligence operativesfiled Friday by special counsel Robert Mueller stated that &quot;a candidate for the U.S. Congress&quot; who was not named in the filing contacted Russian operatives posing as the hacker &quot;Guccifer 2.0&quot; and requested information stolen from the Democratic National Committee&#39;s (DNC) email server.</p>

<p>&quot;The conspirators responded using the Guccifer 2.0 persona and sent the candidate stolen documents related to the candidate&#39;s opponent,&quot; the filing reads.</p>

<p>The court filing does not name the candidate involved in the information transaction or their party affiliation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mueller has been getting it done. The actual collusion indictments can&#39;t come until they establish the foundation of the conspiracy as true, which is why there are these charges against Russian individuals, prosecuters need to establish a theory of the case and prove the basis of it before anyone can be charged for the grand conspiracy.. I know I kind of butchered wording that, but it&#39;s coming. </p>

<p>Obstruction of justice, conspiracy to defraud the US, aiding and abetting computer crimes. These are the charges waiting for Trump and his family and allies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is good to finally see some results from the probe, but the only thing today&#39;s indictments suggested is that a foreign intelligence agency hacked Americans and attempted to influence the election.</p>

<p>To me, that is not really surprising. In fact, it sounds more like par for the course. I can only imagine this is the exact kind of action taken on a daily basis by those within the intelligence community.</p>

<p>I am keeping an open mind, but this is too much of a reach for me to believe this is connected to Trump yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a bit more to it than that though</p>

<p>July 27th Trump asks Russia to get Hillarys emails, that night Russia made its first attempts to hack Hillary</p>

<p>Russia had the DNC files no earlier than March, no later than April. That following June is when Don Jr took a meeting to get dirt to use against Hillary</p>

<p>They got access to over 500k peoples voter data and access to a company that registers voters.</p>

<p>There is an unnamed congressional republican who sought after dirt from Russian hackers, it&#39;s not publicly known if this person knew they were talking to hackers</p>

<p>There are messages sited that match up verbatim to messages Roger Stone had with the guccifer, Stone claimed he wasn&#39;t GRU. Now we know he is and Stone claims he wasn&#39;t sure. He should be really worried at this point in the investigation and not been interviewed yet, that means he might be a target of the investigation.</p>

<p>There&#39;s lots more to come from all of this </p>

<p>This was not the first time the Russians had targeted Hillary&#39;s campaign.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t think someone genuinely conspiring with a foreign nation would announce it in front of hundreds of people and cameras. Just seems unlikely.</p>

<p>My bad, they did attempt to hack her email that very night, I thought that was the first actual hacking attempt and up until then was a disinfo campaign </p>

<p>Yeah probably, but that is a damming coincidence to say the least. Coupled with the Trump tower meetings too show a willingness to collude</p>
