<p>Or change us. That&#39;s the spookiest part, imo. At some point we are no longer in the driver&#39;s seat of what we digest online, but rather it&#39;s spoon-fed to us via algorithms. Our online environment becomes carefully curated for us, and when this happens, we become malleable to new ideas, thoughts, etc that we only believe are our own but are in actuality chosen for us. </p>

<p>Sometimes I even think conspiracy sites like these are actually beneficial to TPTB. The elite do not have to have all citizens blindly complying with their agenda, as there is benefit to hating/fearing it, too: that still gives them power. Paying attention to them is a form of legitimizing them. But that&#39;s a tangent for a different day.</p>

<p>You like to point fingers at other countries,  but,  Eglin AFB in Florida is our very own US-based troll farm.</p>

<p>Eglin Air Force Base was &quot;America&#39;s  most Reddit addicted city&quot; because of their manipulative actions here. They keep close tabs and steer the conversation because our own government considers an educated American populace to be a threat to it&#39;s  power base. </p>

<p>It sure does. Most folks with a minimal about of reading comprehension can see your intended spin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d assume <strong>at least a few are here</strong> from different agencies <em>around the world</em> 
<strong>a few</strong> of our prolific members <strong>are possibly here</strong> to direct the conversation in certain ways. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s like looking at a colony of hundreds of mice breeding under your own deck and telling your neighbors,  </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;d assume at least <strong>a few</strong> mice are <strong>possibly</strong> under my deck, but,  probably from different nests around the neighborhood.  <strong>A few</strong> of those mice are <strong>possibly</strong> here to breed...  but,  just a few&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re  being very careful in your wording to push any association of online manipulation onto other countries,  when data shows our own military is manipulating Reddit to an astonishing degree.  </p>

<p>Three letter agencies manipulate everything you see. Look into Operation Mockingbird.  The CIA was imbedding agents in journalism and TV production decades ago.</p>

<p>Three letter agencies manipulate everything you see. Look into Operation Mockingbird.  The CIA was imbedding agents in journalism and TV production decades ago.</p>

<p>Your stance that they are not actively posting to steer discussion here is naive, at best.  This is the new battleground in the war for your mind;  they&#39;re not disregarding it. </p>
