        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Louis CK was universally condemned in the mainstream media for having an eccentric fetish of jerking off in front of women. I mean sure, it seems that in some cases it&#39;s not entirely clear there was full consensus on the part of the women (I&#39;m sounding like a Jezebel.com writer, I know), and yes, there may be moral/legal issues there.</p>

<p>But given the dark sexual stuff that really goes on behind the scenes in Hollywood and in the upper echelons of American politics, well, it&#39;s fishy. Isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s like they were looking for whatever dirt they had on him in order to take him down. And the dirt they did have on in turns out to be pretty unimpressive.</p>

<p>I mean, long articles in the NYTimes and the New Yorker and other MSM publications solemnly excoriating the guy. A coordinated assault kind of thing.</p>

<p>Well, I was recently listening to a clip of Louis CK in a podcast and he says something about &quot;the jews owning all the media&quot;. He made flippant &quot;over the line&quot; jokes about the jews in other occasions too. This already made me wonder about the real reason for the campaign against him.</p>

<p>And then I was watching this stand-up routine right now, and this part stood out to me. Hahaha. Holy shit. Just watch it:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Louis&#39; actions were the subject of industry rumors for years, maybe a decade until the NYT story and others. It didn&#39;t just appear out of the blue as some scheme to take him down. Have a link for him saying The Jews own all the media? </p>

<p>While I agree that the guy is no Weinstein or the freak who ran NVIXIM, his story reveals nuance to abusive power play relationships and the idea of one&#39;s humiliating fetish requiring the victimization of others. Not the same but of a league, and certainly inappropriate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Libtards and feminist protected Harvey.</p>

<p>Being whit and having money doesn’t make you a rapist. And, most of those women consented.</p>

<p>Harvey’s crime is more along the lines of racketeering. 
Look at what happened to the people who turned him down, like Lendisy L.</p>

<p>People who turned down Louis... nothing happened to them.</p>

<p>He can’t have sex because he’s wealthy?</p>

<p>Consider you are wrong.</p>

<p>Harvey W. wasn’t wrong because he he had money, game, and power. He was wrong because of you turned him down, he’d send the police after you.</p>

<p>Louie did nothing like that.he wasn’t powerful, and even if he was, what he was doing wasn’t wrong. It was weird, but not wrong.</p>

<p>No means no. But, yes is consent. Consent and them complain later? That’s not how it works. Don’t be stupid, don’t be a loser, and don’t perpetuate this idiocy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;These stories are true. At the time, I said to myself that what I did was O.K. because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn’t a question. It’s a predicament for them....The hardest regret to live with is what you’ve done to hurt someone else. And I can hardly wrap my head around the scope of hurt I brought on them..... I’ve brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother.&quot;</p>

<p>wow so lulzy bro! so snarky! nothing wrong at all! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think it is common for male bosses to have sex with their female secretaries or subordinates? Because women are attracted to powerful men. To men who have power over them. </p>

<p>All sexual relationships between a man and a woman are power relationships. Man enjoy dominating, women enjoy being dominated. Why do you 50 Shades of Grey is so popular among women? I could go on.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not justifying rape, I&#39;m saying we have to be realistic about how sex actually works.</p>

<p>In short, what he did was sleazy, but he&#39;s not a monster. He&#39;s a horny guy who may have crossed the line a few times.</p>
