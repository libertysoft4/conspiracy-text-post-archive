    <div class="md"><p>“Formed and molded by a culture of sexual Satanism” is just pointing out my statement and not looking at this too hard? I see a kid sitting down with his idol. The rock cracks a joke and it was taken well. For you clearly it was a poorly worded joke. </p>

<p>What do I look into too much? I like to look into political corruption, the main conspiracies that this sub pushes. Not some sexual satanic culture at every turn. You clearly had bias going into watching this video so why? Just look at the clip clearly and see the context. Do you actually think the rock eats kids? Come the fuck on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just so I’m clear because I “look too much into things,” when it comes to someone talking about pedovore, it is best to remain on the side of giggly humor?  I just want to understand, what with there being a long history of occult religions, elites, and the even the earliest human civilizations eating children.  Humor is the way to go ya?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any suspicion of the rock eating children or being involved in religious or elitist cults where this is common practice? I mean has the rock done this shit before?</p>

Hahaha, isn&#39;t that just hilarious!?!? Nothing could be funnier, right? An evil child molesting robot was the best idea your SNL team could come up with???? Why bring that kind of level of evil into comedy, it is NEVER FUCKING FUNNY TO JOKE ABOUT CHILD MOLESTATION, am I right? It&#39;s not something openly talked about with seriousness, let alone making fun of the subject, ffs! 
The Rock is definitely into the illuminati shit, he&#39;s in every god-dammed action movie now a days, can&#39;t stop seeing him everywhere, even though he&#39;s a not a great actor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. This video doesn&#39;t even give us the full picture of the interview for fucks sake. It&#39;s five minutes of some guy ranting and then a 10 second clip without context of the rest of the interview. The only context we have is of the rock and his history. Must be a conspiracy there tho because he made a joke about eating kids the size of the kid sitting across from him. </p>
