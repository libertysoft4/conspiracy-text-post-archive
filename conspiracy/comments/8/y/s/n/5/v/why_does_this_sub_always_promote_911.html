        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t know who is manipulating this sub but it doesn&#39;t make sense. This sub and conspiracy community in general is built on the idea that the US government has done all these malevolent things over the years. Yet when it comes to Trump, they are immediately taken at face value and people here start beating their chests on Russia basically demanding a new Cold or Hot War.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense when this sub then goes and takes at face value the Iranians or whatever is reported on in Syria by non-mainstream news. Russia is the victim of American meddling and imperialism on this subject here. You all trust the mainstream media and alphabet agencies when it comes to Russia hacking the Democrats but you don&#39;t trust them when those same people/agencies/media tell you Assad gassed his people, Putin&#39;s aggressive actions need to be checked, who carried out 9/11, or basically ANYTHING the federal agencies/government tells you besides things pertaining to Trump.</p>

<p>This double standard about Trump and Russia amuses me. The overall talking points here are to get rid of Trump but nobody here ever says who exactly they want instead. &quot;All politicians are bad&quot; and the usual meaningless non-real world fedora talking points. People here claim they didn&#39;t support Hillary yet carry her water daily which implies they actually DO want Hillary (the chosen candidate of the Establishment) thus a return to the government you accuse of being behind all the conspiracies in the first place! So what is it?</p>

He&#39;s attacked their interests twice in Syria, is reversing course on Iran, is browbeating Europe/NATO into strengthening itself, and is promoting domestic oil/gas that affects the Russian economy in a big way.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s one perspective.  </p>

<p>Another person might view it as he went soft on interests twice in Syria, is isolating Iran from America, thus giving it no choice but to strengthen ties to Russia, we don&#39;t get our imported oil from Russia.  W. Europe, especially Germany, are in a precarious position in regards to Russia, due to their reliance on Russia for petroleum.  I can&#39;t argue that. Russia wants U.S.-Russia gas arrangements though.  Trump wants that too.  He&#39;s tried, though thus far has been unsuccessful, to get sanctions lifted so that a huge Exxon-Rostneft joint project in Russia can get started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t go soft on Syria. He just doesn&#39;t want another expensive proxy war that will risk American tax dollars and soldiers for vague geopolitical interests. That is what he ran on and has been speaking out on for years in Iraq. Despite all that he still launched airstrikes on Syria and Russian interests TWICE, the only times during his Presidency he was applauded by the media and establishment mind you. Meddling in that part of the world has created the refugee crisis that goes against Trump&#39;s interests but helped that of the European leaders desperate for population growth. </p>

<p>Iran under its current leadership will never have strong ties to us. To do so would be trading Saudi Arabia, much of the Arab world, and Israel away which means nothing is gained/more is lost. Russia will align with whoever is against us, so aligning with Iran merely creates new enemies. Iran has proven to be an untrustworthy, erratic ally. </p>

<p>As for Russia and oil, you see the pointlessness of NATO if Germany and Western Europe are ultimately reliant on Russia? It is the equivalent of demanding more cops on the street to protect you from your drug dealer. How can Trump be blamed for anything when Europe is propping up Russia and Iran? When you treat these two nations as normal trading partners, why should we Republicans care about or fear Putin?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t go soft on Syria. He doesn&#39;t want to get involved in another expensive proxy war that will cost us hundreds of billions in tax dollars and soldiers for vague geopolitical interests. He has been talking about this for years with Iraq. Despite this he still launched airstrikes on Syria and Russian interests twice, the only times he has been praised by his detractors in the media and establishment mind you. A war would create a refugee crisis, which goes against Trump&#39;s interests and help the European (and American Democrats) politicians desperate for more workers &amp; voters. </p>

<p>Iran under their current leadership will never be close to us. Doing so would merely push Saudi Arabia, Israel, and other Arab states away from us. Nothing is gained, you see and more is loss. Russia will support whoever is against us. Iran has proven itself as an erratic and untrustworthy ally. </p>

<p>As for Russia and gas/oil, you certainly see the pointlessness of NATO. It&#39;s the equivalent of someone demanding more cops to protect them from their drug dealer. Trump is the only one who is pointing out how ridiculous this is. Why should he or any American worry about Russia when our supposed allies are treating them (as well as Iran) like normal trading partners. It is why this current Russia-Trump hysteria is falling on deaf ears with his base. </p>

<p>This has been answered so many times and is so patently obvious in the first place than anyone asking it at this point is just being straight up dishonest, either with themself or with us. </p>

<p>To pick just the two most obvious examples, literally the only Trump directed change to the RNC platform was to water down support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine, and repeatedly he&#39;s blocked or dragged his feet in implementing Russian sanctions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Please explain in a little more detail how the Trump administration has broadly opposed Russian interested in Syria.</p>

Not anywhere close.   </p>

<p>Well it&#39;s looking like he&#39;s a giant monkey wrench in their plans to have hillary &quot;elected&quot; and ignore MILLIONS of crimes.</p>

<p>A good place to start is the fact that in trumps term so far he has busted 10x more pedophiles than the previous 2 terms of obama.</p>

<p>It even spawned the &#39;metoo&#39; thing to get out in front of it.<br/>
&#39;<em>oh we investegated ourselves and threw weinstein under the buss.  nothing else here!</em>&#39;</p>

<p>It even spawned the first ever mainstream pushback against a conspiracy <em>theory</em> i have ever seen in 40 years.<br/>
Pizzagate is fake news!   </p>

<p>Most days i think THAT is the real swamp being drained.   pedos and their control of our country.</p>

<p>Thousands of arrests.  And yet you won&#39;t see anything about any of it on tv.<br/>
Not even fox.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not as simple as binary thinking: Government good, Government bad. Republican, Democrats. Yes or No.</p>

<p>Within each group or organization there are different agendas. Each president has their own policies and view points.</p>

<p>Binary thinking has gotten this country to where it’s at.</p>

<p>“Oh you’re against Hillary therefore you’re a Trump supporter....”</p>

<p>It’s not that simple. There’s are competing elements within each government bureaucratic structure. Some people are constitutional minded, some neocon, some liberal, etc ...</p>

<p>Just because a conspiracy minded Trump fanboy is all in with Trump, doesn’t mean they can’t also question certain choices and policies he stands behind.</p>

<p>There are certain bands I like that put out bad albums or write less than stellar songs.  Also , there are shit bands that sometimes only have 1 hit or one good song.</p>

<p>Get away from binary thinking. Live in the grey.</p>

<p>I’ve never really seen that. Just look at the stickied thread about the 12 indictments. Lots of comments are from trump supporters saying it’s fake new or saying what about Hillary. It’s always it didn’t happen or Hillary did it too/worse. </p>

<p>Yet when it comes to Trump, they are immediately taken at face value and people here start beating their chests on Russia basically demanding a new Cold or Hot War.</p>

<p>Welcome to the current <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> , where Totally Organic<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> users flood posts and vote brigade. They downvote anything that is critical of the MSM narrative and call them Russian Agents<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> or Putin Puppets<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> who &quot;hate democracy.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense when this sub then goes and takes at face value the Iranians or whatever is reported on in Syria by non-mainstream news. Russia is the victim of American meddling and imperialism on this subject here. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Believe me, organic users do not take anything at face-value. You are completely correct about Russia being a victim of American imperialism. NATO explicitly promised Russia in the 90s that they would not expand east. Except now they are conducting war games on Russias border while, you know, expanding east and initiating regime change operations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This double standard about Trump and Russia amuses me. The overall talking points here are to get rid of Trump but nobody here ever says who exactly they want instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, you are right. If Trump goes down we get... Pence. Horray?</p>

<p>So yeah, just make note of the propagandists here. I&#39;ve tagged quite a lot of people and the vast majority have been accurate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is organic. Rightwing people have fewer difficulties incorporating conspiracy theories into their world-view. So naturally, there will be a fair amount of conspiracy theorising on this sub about plots <em>against</em> Trump.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why leftwing people are so instinctively-averse to conspiracy theories (in the popular sense). But they are, and it&#39;s pretty much an article of faith on the left that not only do conspiracies not happen but that anyone who thinks conspiracies do happen is either an imbecile or a danger to society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trump people are just trying to believe in something &amp; hoping for the best. </p>

<p>Maybe they are feeling power they don&#39;t experience in their real lives by living vicariously through Trump&#39;s mouth.</p>

<p>I voted for Trump only because I couldn&#39;t stand the idea of another Clinton or Bush in office....not certain he is doing the best for the citizens of this country by lowering taxes for the rich as far as he did.</p>

<p>I think the corporate media wanted to drown out a massively popular socialist candidate Sanders (Look at all his rallies in 2015-2016 on youtube &amp; decide for yourself who had bigger rallies) &amp; they did by elevating Trump 247 in the media &amp; letting Clinton skate to the Dem nomination without having to ask her any difficult questions.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what elected Trump, not the Russians.</p>
