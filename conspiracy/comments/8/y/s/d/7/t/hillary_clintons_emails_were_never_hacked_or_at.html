It&#39;s the same with Laura Silsby getting arrested for trying to kidnap 33 children and then getting her sentence reduced by the Clintons. The gatekeeper Also Alex Jones getting his youtube channel frozen with 33k uploads. Trump appointing 33 Catholic advisors. The  Ryugyong Hotel in North Korea, a 33 decametre pyramid which was there way before the Singapore summit theatre. The order for 33 Christians to be executed in North Korea. Putin&#39;s 33 word oath under the all-seeing eye at the Kremlin. Trump proposing $33 billion border spending and so on. The hidden hand has been leaving it&#39;s markers in everything for years, like the 33 sections in the UN logo. They do it on both sides of the political spectrum too which is why I lost hope with voting,  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it interesting that everyone is screaming about Trump Russia collusion when it was Hillary doing deals for them at the State Dept.  Uranium One?  Anyway, FBI said itself that they never investigated her email server where classified info was going to people who didn&#39;t have that clearance.  And there apparently was evidence that the server was wiped.  I mean how isn&#39;t that a crime?  If you or I had that stuff on our computers, we would get arrested and jailed before we knew what hit us.  I really, really doubt that Trump colluded with Russia.  They would have nothing to gain by helping Trump.</p>

<p>This has been thoroughly debunked ad nauseum.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Then you either haven&#39;t been paying attention or aren&#39;t intellectually honest. Manafort literally emailed Russians offering private briefings on the campaign in order to &quot;get whole&quot; for the millions of dollars he owes to Russian oligarchs. That is just one of many examples of intent to collude from the campaign.</p>

<p>Aside from all the obvious things they&#39;d have to gain, you mean, like a far more Russia friendly administration willing to limit sanctions and undermine the Western Alliance?</p>

<p>It does in the sense that it discourages them if executed properly. And of course plenty of folks have advocated improving our cyber defense capabilities as well. Meanwhile, Trump has offered such brilliant suggestions as:</p>

<p>Manafort was his campaign manager so for all intents and purposes, yes. He was unpaid in that role, by the way. Nothing suspicious about that arrangement!</p>

<p>But if you&#39;d like proof that Trump himself knew, look no further than the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. If you believe that his campaign manager, his son, and his son-in-law met in Trump&#39;s home base with a representative of the Russian government for the explicit purpose of acquiring dirt on Clinton without Trump&#39;s knowledge, you&#39;re naive. </p>

<p>But thankfully we don&#39;t just have to rely on common sense. We know that Trump helped craft Donald Jr&#39;s public (and false) statement about the nature of the meeting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It wasn&#39;t Trump who was mishandling classified information either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice try to deflect. Clinton was wrong for what she did. Of course we&#39;ve learned that the Trump administration has even worse security practices. Kushner used a private email address to conduct White House business and Trump routinely uses an unsecured cell phone. The fact that your ilk doesn&#39;t care about these things proves you reapoy never cared about Clinton&#39;s email practices except as a convenient talking point.</p>
