    <div class="md"><p>Awesome! Here’s a few to start:</p>

<p>1) Do people on here ever express an interest in participating in respectable/feasible dissident organizations, and are there any such organizations that get brought up on here? If so, could you tell me what they’re called?</p>

<p>2) If you had to ballpark a guess, what would you say the ratio of trolls vs. legit participants is on here? </p>

<p>3) What’s your impression of the mods? </p>

<p>4) Could you list a few theories that you think are particularly compelling and accessible to newbies?</p>

<p>5) Could you list a few theories in particular that you think are compelling, but that are liable to scare off newbies because they’re too scary/dark or difficult to comprehend?</p>

<p>6) Could you list a few conspiracies that tend to get a lot of attention, but that you’re confident are bogus? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will do my best here:</p>

<p>1)  sometimes I guess if there is a big event but honestly I don&#39;t really see that mentioned all that much.  </p>

<p>2)  not sure of the percentage of trolls but I can say with certainty that the amount of trolls here has increased dramatically in the past couple/few years.  This sub seemed better to me in years past.  Lots of posts are political in nature, it used to be more UFO/Aliens/gov&#39;t conspiracies/Fed reserve/etc, now you see lots of Trump/Russia stuff.  Also this sub gets brigaded pretty frequently, much more than it used to.</p>

<p>3)  I don&#39;t have much to say about the mods, they seem pretty fair.  TBH they probably have a tough time sometimes moderating this sub, there are over 650k users on this sub and lots of comments.  There was a mod here a few years ago that a lot of people had problems with, I won&#39;t name the person and they are not a mod here anymore.</p>

<p>4)  I think 9/11 is the most important conspiracy to investigate.  That&#39;s what brought me here in the first place.  I also like to read about UFO&#39;s and other unusual phenomenons.  The Federal Reserve is interesting to research as well.</p>

<p>5)  most of them are because by definition a conspiracy is two or more people plotting to do something illegal/immoral.  If it were ever confirmed that the US Gov&#39;t was behind 9/11 how would people react?  It would be crazy to say the least.</p>

<p>6)  The whole Russia/Trump thing is boring so I don&#39;t pay much attention to it.  Also some of the posts here are topics I don&#39;t follow all that much (like pizzagate) so I can&#39;t say with certainty what&#39;s bogus or not.  I don&#39;t read posts that don&#39;t really interest me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(been in this sub about 10 years)</p>

<p>1) they used to back in the OccupyWallstreet and RestoreTheFourth days, before the whole movement was co-opted and crushed on Reddit and outside of it.
2) Viewing is probably 50:50, but commenting and voting is probably 90% trolls. Most real legit people gave up on the massive effort to combat the trolls. They consume the content and move on with little participation to avoid the troll bait, which has reached ridiculous proportions since TMOR and the last election.
3) They do pretty decent and mostly stay out of the mess. The problem with brigades, trolls, and coordinated efforts is there is no way to be sure, so less censorship is better.
4) 9/11, warmongering/destabilization for financial gain, and mass surveillance.
5) P1zz@Gate and the many things that fall under that umbrella, false flags/crisis actors, and vaccine safety concerns. Many of those scare people off, because the public had been coordinated in a way to intimidate people from speaking about those topics.
6) Flat Earth, chemtrails, Q, Russian collusion as portrayed by the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha oh boy.</p>

<p>Well, first of all—as I’m sure you understand—the Alex Jones version of the “big enchilada” is sheer lunacy. Inter-dimensional beings? Come on. </p>

<p>In reality, the big enchilada is pretty much exactly what you’d expect. In a word, it’s corruption. Obviously, “corruption” is a gross oversimplification of what’s going on, but that’s the core of the problem. Innumerable governments, media outlets, financial institutions, industrial giants, etc. from all around the world have effectively been corrupted in one way or another. Far too many wealthy, powerful, and well-connected people have been allowed to abuse power and authority for far too long. At this point, the sheer amount of control our planet’s global “elite” exercises over the rest of the world makes them virtually untouchable. Thanks to venal politicians and crooked cops, the elite are completely protected from a legal standpoint, and thanks to corrupt media conglomerates, they can effectively manipulate popular opinion with ease. They hold 98% the cards, and they’re ruthlessly gunning for the other 2%, leaving senseless tragedy after senseless in their wake. </p>

<p>As far as my final conclusions go, I have some good news and some bad news...</p>

<p>The good news: </p>

<p>-We can <em>definitely</em> purge corruption from our government, hold the corrupt accountable, and effectively prevent corruption from <em>ever</em> getting this out of hand again. </p>

<p>-I’ve been working day and night for years devising and detailing an extensive and specific plan to accomplish this task <em>peacefully</em>, and there’s not a doubt in my mind that this plan can, and <em>will</em> work, just so long as I can garner enough public support to get the ball rolling. Sound too good to be true? Just wait. I’ll prove you wrong. </p>

<p>-There are indeed many wealthy and influential people who aren’t susceptible to corruption, and who could be persuaded to actively support and endorse such a cause. Some people can’t be bribed or extorted, myself included.</p>

<p>The bad news: </p>

<p>-Because the problem of corruption has gotten so far out of hand, because the corrupt elite are so deeply entrenched within our existing power structures, and because the stakes are so high, we have no choice but to take drastic action. No matter which course of action we choose, significant sacrifices will be unavoidable if we’re to succeed. (I’ll spare you the explanatory details, but If we go by my plan, as an alternative war, the most significant sacrifice we’ll need to make as a society will be to <em>temporarily</em> revert back to slightly more modest and more community-centric lifestyles until the corruption is dealt with. The only people who would need to put their lives at risk would be those who volunteer to participate in their local defensive militias, and those who would participate the investigation/capture of the key players among the corrupt elite.)</p>

<p>-Human civilization is currently on the fast-track towards self-destruction, and we are <em>rapidly</em> running out of time to unite ourselves in order to deal with this problem properly. If we can’t bring ourselves to unite and face the problem of corruption head-on in the next few decades, we can kiss our hopes and dreams for the future goodbye. The two main threats to human civilization, and the world at large—environmental destruction and global war—will absolutely <em>never</em> be addressed as long as our ruling elite are in charge. The elite <em>depend</em> on division and war to maintain power and control over the masses, so they continually instigate perpetuate war all around the globe, and they <em>escalate</em> the severity of wars when the people become dissident. We can’t fight the corrupt if we’re too busy fighting ourselves. Furthermore, environmental destruction is of no consequence to the elite, because they have virtually bottomless wealth, all the best Human Resources, unrestricted access to the world’s natural resources, and access every technology they need to create their own private, self-sustaining safe havens. They’d gladly hide in luxurious bunkers and let rest of us perish as Earth’s ecosphere collapses, taking humanity down with it.</p>

<p>-The people need to be more-or-less completely <em>united</em> before we can hope to begin purging corruption and getting human civilization back on track towards peace, progress, prosperity, and sustainability. Initially uniting the people will be an incredibly difficult task, as our media and or government are continually coaxing us into butting heads with each other. This first step will definitely be the hardest.</p>

<p>-Things are inevitably going to get worse before they get better. There is nothing the global elite won’t do in order to keep us from uniting against them and overthrowing them. The closer we get to them, the harder they will fight back. They’ll spread lies and manipulative propaganda and make up bogus threats to confuse us, distract us, and cause us to doubt our convictions. They’ll orchestrate deadly false-flag terrorist attacks to try and get us abandon our efforts in order to fight another pointless war against foreign boogeymen instead. They’ll assassinate our leaders to break our morale. They <em>never</em> fight fair, and they have no sense of honor, so it’ll be an ugly, chaotic, uphill battle for a while at first.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you want more, you’re gonna have to wait for the book. It’ll be a few more years. Obviously, it’ll be free. I’m not gonna withhold my ideas from the world just to make a profit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are your interests. I&#39;m not head honcho, but I can probably point you at researchers who specialize in those areas. </p>

<p>Also, bear in mind, this place was trashed during and after the election by angry partisans. Quite a bit of cleanup has gone on, but we still have a fair few forum lice. But we got some awesome researchers still. But, I would highly suggest staying away from any highly politicized current events which intersect conspiracies. At least until you get a feel for the community.</p>

<p>Welcome, and I hope you enjoy yourself here! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome! Here’s a few to start:</p>

<p>1) Do people on here ever express an interest in participating in respectable/feasible dissident organizations, and are there any such organizations that get brought up on here? If so, could you tell me what they’re called?</p>

<p>2) If you had to ballpark a guess, what would you say the ratio of trolls vs. legit participants is on here? </p>

<p>3) What’s your impression of the mods? </p>

<p>4) Could you list a few theories that you think are particularly compelling and accessible to newbies?</p>

<p>5) Could you list a few theories in particular that you think are compelling, but that are liable to scare off newbies because they’re too scary/dark or difficult to comprehend?</p>

<p>6) Could you list a few conspiracies that tend to get a lot of attention, but that you’re confident are bogus? </p>
