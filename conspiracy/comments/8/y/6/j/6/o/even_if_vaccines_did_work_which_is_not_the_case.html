    <div class="md"><p>Guess I wasn&#39;t super crystal clear enough when I said, no vaccine is safe or efficient for any given individual.  What I mean by this is, you can&#39;t have a single vaccine for a specific virus etc and have it be safe (or work) for every one who uses it - our body chemistry&#39;s are complex and diverse.  There is damage that occurs to many people and they are paid and they are silenced.  In many instances, the same vaccine dose is used for a young child and a full grown adult with large differences in weight.  There are no studies on the combined effect of mercury (still in Flu vaccine) and aluminium in the brain.  The studies done on vaccines still use the adjuvants in the placebo, therefor nullifying all their data and conclusions made on said faulty data.  Even the head of Lancet said:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.</em>   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s clear consensus corporate science is bought and paid for like every other sector it touches.  It&#39;d be naive to think Pharmatech wasn&#39;t actively trying to make you a chronic costumer to increase their profits to make the board happy on their quarterly meetings.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Posted previously, but a relevant hypothesis:</p>

<p>Mercury and Aluminum salts are used as preservatives and adjuvants in vaccines, respectively. Mercury and Aluminum salts are lipophilic, meaning they dissolve in fat (e.g., brain, liver). In children, they easily pass the blood brain barrier and collect in the brain. In adults, they tend to collect in the liver.</p>

<p>Once dissolved, they combine to form an amalgam. Either mercury or aluminum alone, in small doses, is fairly benign. Combine them, and you get this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/IrdYueB9pY4">Mercury and Aluminum</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine that reaction taking place within the human body -- specifically, within an infant&#39;s brain or an adult&#39;s liver. That would explain both &quot;autism&quot; (brain damage) and &quot;auto-immune disease&quot; (liver damage). </p>

<p>Cover it all up with a wholly pwned medical system, including autopsies and labs that shuck the whole thing off as &quot;genetics&quot;. And, of course, a massive PR machine that dismisses any researchers as crazy. Gives the &#39;elites&#39; a great system for </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines are injected into the muscle or straight into the blood stream, no pathogens naturally enter our body in this manner.</p>

<p>Humans have never been cut or jabbed. We have zero Defense against this!</p>

<p>Our immune system is not meant for this. We also stimulate the immune system by pooling in some toxic metals (aluminum and mercury, the latter still present in Flu vaccines) in our body.</p>

<p>where do these end up pooling? Is there a Toxic metal glad pool?</p>

<p>We already have a wonderful NATURAL alternative that&#39;s been working great since the dawn of fucking mankind and before.</p>

<p>Breast milk from a healthy mother on a good diet is more than enough to pass on what the baby needs in regards to anti-bodies and immunity.</p>

<p>So is this claiming breast milk stops diseases? im confused.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a immuno-deficient society and poor hygiene that create these horrific ailments. You can see a steady decline in most all diseases with the introduction of PROPER SANITATION PRACTICES AND HYGIENE - not fucking vaccines. </p>

<p>I mean Hygiene takes out certian things, but we learned about this in 7th grade in florida on how cholera is bacteria, and polio is a virus. They are two seperate things and have two diffrent ways of killing us.</p>

<p>Scarlet Fever as well as several other HORRIFIC ailments passed through our human-collective and went out the other door as we started to clean up our act, no vaccines were necessary.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s stop masking symptoms from poor diet choices and lifestyle habits with vaccinations THAT DO NOT GRANT LIFETIME IMMUNITY nor are they proven AT ALL, WHAT-SO-EVER,</p>

<p>Except with polio, small pox, chicken pox, measles, hepatitus, etc etc etc</p>

<p>let me make this fuckin SUPER CRYSTAL CLEAR, to be safe or effective for ANY GIVEN INDIVIDUAL. You cannot say that this is an acceptable loss you fuckin degenerate.</p>

<p>Who is he calling a Degenerate? Why the Cursing? Always trying to get that emotinal draw to over look the obvious.</p>

<p>Where is your humanity? If you can fathom that money has corrupted and influenced politics to the point of it being destructive and causes war crimes throughout the world - it doesn&#39;t take a leap of reasoning to acknowledge that the medical and scientific establishments have been thoroughly and completely corrupted by money.</p>

<p>Oh so Vaccines are part of the deep state now too?</p>

<p>We know MMR is horrible, </p>

<p>Dowethough.jpg</p>

<p>even pro-vaccine people agree that the three should not be combined into a single dose. Flu vaccines have been shown to be a joke, even causing a rise in over 500% in gaining the flu in the elderly (compared to those who did not receive the vaccine). </p>

<p>Where does this claim even come from? Also Elderly die from the flu? Who knu?</p>

<p>Gardisal is maiming and killing our teenagers. Polio vaccines are dangerous (live virus usually put in the nasal cavity etc) and in India, Bill Gates polio vaccine caused a rise in cases by 47,500 in direct correlation. He should be in jail.</p>

<p>Bill Gates is for sure sitting over his next dastardly plan right now.</p>

<p>Furthermore, while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received.</p>

<p>Is this just wild linking or just me?</p>

<p>Or how about this revelation from a WHISTLEBLOWER who worked within the CDC and how they knew and covered up this fact:</p>

<p>Dr. Hooker&#39;s study, published August 8 in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Translational Neurodegeneration, shows that African-American boys receiving their first MMR vaccine before 36 months of age are 3.4 times more likely to develop autism vs. after 36 months.</p>

<p>In Science we see if this is backed up more than just once. Geez </p>

<p>You are a profit stream for the pharmaceutical companies. It&#39;s as plain as day to see.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also one of many doctors, but this one in particular who doesn&#39;t give vaccines according the schedule, but waits till after three years and spreads them out. Out of all his vaccinated children, there is an expected rate of Autism among the total number of kids (not because of vaccines, just in any sampling of children) - but he has zero children out of over 1500 with no autism. He should have at least ~20+.</p>

<p>So then maybe we should vaccinate later? But wait we established they were all bad a second ago</p>

<p>This has been a wild ride.</p>

<p>In regards to your doubts about MMR:<br/>
 Here&#39;s a study that; conclusively demonstrate chronic brain damage in the form of “panencephalitis” due to a vaccine-derived strain of the mumps virus <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770235">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770235</a> Or how about when evidence was destroyed:  <em>In August, 2014,  Dr. William Thompson, a senior scientist at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention worked with a whistleblower attorney to provide my office with documents related to a 2004 CDC study that examined the possibility of a relationship between the mumps, measles and rubella vaccines and autism.  In a statement released in August, 2014, Dr. Thompson stated</em> <strong><em>“I regret that my co-authors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the Journal of Pediatrics.”</em></strong>   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where does this claim even come from? Also Elderly die from the flu? Who knu? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several vaccine scientists who say as much  <a href="http://ahrp.org/former-merck-scientists-sue-merck-alleging-mmr-vaccine-efficacy-fraud/">http://ahrp.org/former-merck-scientists-sue-merck-alleging-mmr-vaccine-efficacy-fraud/</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The suit charges that Merck knew its measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine was less effective than the purported 95\% level, and it alleges that senior management was aware and also oversaw testing that concealed the actual effectiveness. According to the lawsuit, Merck began a sham testing program in the late 1990’s to hide the declining efficacy of the vaccine. The objective of the fraudulent trials was to “report efficacy of 95\% or higher regardless of the vaccine’s true efficacy.”</em>   </p>

<p>In Science we see if this is backed up more than just once. Geez </p>

<p>Hard to do studies like this when orthodoxy says it&#39;s unethical to not vaccinate children - but they exist <a href="http://info.cmsri.org/the-driven-researcher-blog/vaccinated-vs.-unvaccinated-guess-who-is-sicker">http://info.cmsri.org/the-driven-researcher-blog/vaccinated-vs.-unvaccinated-guess-who-is-sicker</a> Look at the difference in conditions for those who were vaccinated vs those who weren&#39;t.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So then maybe we should vaccinate later?   But wait we established they were all bad a second ago </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the beauty of choice vs mandating vaccines.  It&#39;s up to the parent to decide what they deem safe for their child (every child is different, every vaccine can be questioned if you&#39;re a good parent).  If some people are afraid that the kids at the playground are shedding polio or MMR from their live vaccines and didn&#39;t follow the instructions on the box to stay away from children and other immunosuppressed individuals for up to two weeks - then they can get the shot if they want.  Vaccine shedding is a thing and the disease can be transmitted to others (literally drools out of their faces as they touch every thing).  If you don&#39;t think the Flu Vaccine is efficacious (which it isn&#39;t) and know that it still contains mercury - you can so no, but maybe you believe in the pertussis vaccine.  That&#39;s your choice.<br/>
Hope you learned some thing as there have been plenty of information posted from verified sources and studies linked throughout my reply  </p>
