        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>WaPo just dropped a story that the SCOTUS Justice-elect reported somewhere between $60k and $200k in debt on three credit cards and a bank loan, ostensibly to purchase Washington Nationals tickets. </p>

<p>According to the White House, Kavanaugh paid the debt off when friends &quot;reimbursed him for their share of the tickets,&quot; and that the debt that remains falls below reporting requirements.</p>

<p>First of all...who the hell can spend that much on baseball tickets? My wife&#39;s family has two Dodgers season tix, and they&#39;re good seats that cost AT MOST $10k for a whole season. Was he buying suites or tickets behind home plate that he couldn&#39;t afford?</p>

<p>Beyond that, is there any paper trail for these reimbursements? We&#39;re talking six figures in money, for a guy who wasn&#39;t making all that much.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s nothing, but given the stories that Kennedy agreed to retire only if Kavanaugh replaced him, and Kennedy&#39;s son&#39;s connections to Deutsche Bank and lending large amounts of money to Trump...wow does this smell like a conspiracy. </p>

<p>The entire Stormy/McDougall thing, called fake and ended up being true. Trump tower meeting, called fake news until Jr released the emails himself.

<p>What did I say that was wrong?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its not necessarily wrong, hear me out.  You obviously know that I support Trump and I obviously know that you explicitly don&#39;t.  You believe all the news coming out from the left that Trump is guilty of all things, and I explicitly don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that Trump, while imperfect, is figuring out how to do, and doing as much of the things he campaigned on wanting to do.  You are of the opinion that those things he campaigned on are racist, homophobic, transphobic, islamaphobic or whatever else it is the left believes now... </p>

<p>Nothing you can say to me from MSM sources is going to make me believe anything, that power is beyond you.  As far as &quot;engaging&quot; with you, I have attempted to many times and you typically just repeat the latest media matters opinions at me while being as rude as possible about it.  You shouldn&#39;t even be asking me if I engage with people of different political opinions on a website known for silencing everything that isn&#39;t left wing with the exception of The_donald, Conspiracy (kinda) and a hand full of nevertrump zero activity conservative subs.</p>

<p>If i wanted to &quot;engage&quot; with the MSM I could just turn on the TV and have it delivered to me by an attractive woman with serious face, A gay man with grey hair and a serious face who squints a lot or short haired lady who is too busy being outraged at everything to take seriously.  All of these other choices would be better than engaging with reddit users from the Resistocracy who support violence from antifa and think that everything is the white man&#39;s fault.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t fucking stand these reddit progressives, I would literally prefer to be trapped in a room with Hillary Clinton herself.  At least then I could brow beat her about how stupid it was to help kill the one &quot;dictator&quot; who actually surrendered their nuclear weapons and will now forever serve as the number one reason no other country in their right mind would ever consider dealing with the US on surrendering their nukes.</p>

<p>All this noise about Trump in my humble opinion is just the sound that Hillary Clinton makes as she falls from the summit of power in this land.  It was a long climb up there so I expect to keep hearing her curse and cry for a while before she hits rock bottom.</p>

<p>I really could give two fucks less about le resistance outside of being annoyed that they have managed to ruin so much of what used to be great about reddit.  It was that <strong>people of different political opinions</strong> clause that has pretty much ruined this site.  The fear of diverse opinions being enforced top down from reddit&#39;s power mods and who knows who is paying to play here. </p>

<p>Its sad.  but isn&#39;t that pretty much the only reason you&#39;re ever here?  to lecture people of different political opinons?</p>

<p>womp womp! how dare you sir! how absolutely dare you!</p>

<p>Kino! don&#39;t do it Kino! you can&#39;t just take someone&#39;s hat!</p>

<p>Trump will never be president.  Everyone who knows anything knows that.  Take it to the bank.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;m back, this Trump Derangement Syndrome is the best thing to happen to this country in a long time honestly.  I don&#39;t want you to ever stop.  I want to keep hearing complaints about Trump like 30 years from now.  And I know that I will 6-3 probably 7-2 next time ole Ginsburg takes a nap.  </p>

<p>7-2.. whew can she hold out long enough?</p>

<p>7-motherfucking-2,  That&#39;s like 40 years at least.  40 years of hearing people blame Trump and I want to follow every minute of it.  Thats... holy shit that&#39;s probably the rest of my freaking life.  If Ginsbug takes a fucking nap I might be able to retire knowing that I did my fucking part, I&#39;ll be able to just ride out the unstoppable momentum of a stacked SCOTUS in my favor.</p>

<p>fucking hell man, I appreciate the hell out of this epiphany you just guided me through.  It has really been a pleasure working with you tonight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A wall itself isn&#39;t inherently racist, it&#39;s the rhetoric and how the policy is enacted which can be racist. Like how requiring an ID to vote isn&#39;t racist but the way it was done was specifically to target black people and supress the vote (based on a state Supreme Court ruling). Trumps entire messaging behind the wall was calling Mexicans rapists and murderers, coupled with him declaring an American judge unfit to sit on his case because his parents are Mexican. Also around the time he was calling for a muslim ban, which is both racist and unconstitutional. When you put the context in play, and not just look at it as a building project, it&#39;s pretty clear that the platform of the wall was racist and design to energize racist people </p>

<p>Okay from a non leftist this is what I see.</p>

<p>If they build a wall it&#39;s racist, if they don&#39;t build a wall and process the ILLEGALs it&#39;s racist.</p>

<p>If we do voter ID it&#39;s racist, if we don&#39;t do voter ID then it&#39;s Russians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do mean no? This isn&#39;t a talking point, that&#39;s the ruling from the court and the federal SCOTUS agreed with the ruling, this was only a couple years ago. If that isn&#39;t an example of racism then I don&#39;t know what it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re determined to build a strawman it seems, ICEs practices  and the wall have nothing to do with each other. The wall is a big waste of money, that&#39;s the strongest reason to oppose it, Trumps rhetoric about Mexicans is what is racist. He conflates legal and illegal immigration all the time as well, so it&#39;s hard for people to believe he&#39;s only talking about just the &quot;bad guys&quot; </p>

<p>What did I say that was wrong?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its not necessarily wrong, hear me out.  You obviously know that I support Trump and I obviously know that you explicitly don&#39;t.  You believe all the news coming out from the left that Trump is guilty of all things, and I explicitly don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that Trump, while imperfect, is figuring out how to do, and doing as much of the things he campaigned on wanting to do.  You are of the opinion that those things he campaigned on are racist, homophobic, transphobic, islamaphobic or whatever else it is the left believes now... </p>

<p>Nothing you can say to me from MSM sources is going to make me believe anything, that power is beyond you.  As far as &quot;engaging&quot; with you, I have attempted to many times and you typically just repeat the latest media matters opinions at me while being as rude as possible about it.  You shouldn&#39;t even be asking me if I engage with people of different political opinions on a website known for silencing everything that isn&#39;t left wing with the exception of The_donald, Conspiracy (kinda) and a hand full of nevertrump zero activity conservative subs.</p>

<p>If i wanted to &quot;engage&quot; with the MSM I could just turn on the TV and have it delivered to me by an attractive woman with serious face, A gay man with grey hair and a serious face who squints a lot or short haired lady who is too busy being outraged at everything to take seriously.  All of these other choices would be better than engaging with reddit users from the Resistocracy who support violence from antifa and think that everything is the white man&#39;s fault.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t fucking stand these reddit progressives, I would literally prefer to be trapped in a room with Hillary Clinton herself.  At least then I could brow beat her about how stupid it was to help kill the one &quot;dictator&quot; who actually surrendered their nuclear weapons and will now forever serve as the number one reason no other country in their right mind would ever consider dealing with the US on surrendering their nukes.</p>

<p>All this noise about Trump in my humble opinion is just the sound that Hillary Clinton makes as she falls from the summit of power in this land.  It was a long climb up there so I expect to keep hearing her curse and cry for a while before she hits rock bottom.</p>

<p>I really could give two fucks less about le resistance outside of being annoyed that they have managed to ruin so much of what used to be great about reddit.  It was that <strong>people of different political opinions</strong> clause that has pretty much ruined this site.  The fear of diverse opinions being enforced top down from reddit&#39;s power mods and who knows who is paying to play here. </p>

<p>Its sad.  but isn&#39;t that pretty much the only reason you&#39;re ever here?  to lecture people of different political opinons?</p>

<p>womp womp! how dare you sir! how absolutely dare you!</p>

<p>Kino! don&#39;t do it Kino! you can&#39;t just take someone&#39;s hat!</p>

<p>Trump will never be president.  Everyone who knows anything knows that.  Take it to the bank.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;m back, this Trump Derangement Syndrome is the best thing to happen to this country in a long time honestly.  I don&#39;t want you to ever stop.  I want to keep hearing complaints about Trump like 30 years from now.  And I know that I will 6-3 probably 7-2 next time ole Ginsburg takes a nap.  </p>

<p>7-2.. whew can she hold out long enough?</p>

<p>7-motherfucking-2,  That&#39;s like 40 years at least.  40 years of hearing people blame Trump and I want to follow every minute of it.  Thats... holy shit that&#39;s probably the rest of my freaking life.  If Ginsbug takes a fucking nap I might be able to retire knowing that I did my fucking part, I&#39;ll be able to just ride out the unstoppable momentum of a stacked SCOTUS in my favor.</p>

<p>fucking hell man, I appreciate the hell out of this epiphany you just guided me through.  It has really been a pleasure working with you tonight.</p>

<p>you typically just repeat the latest media matters opinions at me while being as rude as possible about it.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t remember being rude, if I came off that way my apologies. Sounds like you just shut your brain off if you encounter a left wing take, just based off your own words. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You shouldn&#39;t even be asking me if I engage with people of different political opinions on a website known for silencing everything that isn&#39;t left wing with the exception of The_donald, Conspiracy (kinda) and a hand full of nevertrump zero activity conservative subs.</p>

<p>This is just false. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>who support violence from antifa </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not me. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and think that everything is the white man&#39;s fault.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t understand where this victimhood comes from? Do you feel at fault or guilty when topics of the history or race relations in America come up? Let&#39;s be honest white people don&#39;t have a great track record there. </p>

<p>....... Out of that whole rant you didn&#39;t even adress a single example I gave you from the previous comment</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do mean no? This isn&#39;t a talking point, that&#39;s the ruling from the court and the federal SCOTUS agreed with the ruling, this was only a couple years ago. If that isn&#39;t an example of racism then I don&#39;t know what it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re determined to build a strawman it seems, ICEs practices  and the wall have nothing to do with each other. The wall is a big waste of money, that&#39;s the strongest reason to oppose it, Trumps rhetoric about Mexicans is what is racist. He conflates legal and illegal immigration all the time as well, so it&#39;s hard for people to believe he&#39;s only talking about just the &quot;bad guys&quot; </p>
