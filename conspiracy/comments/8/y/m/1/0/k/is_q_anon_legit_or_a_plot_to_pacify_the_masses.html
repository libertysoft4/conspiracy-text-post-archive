<p>Q could totally be real.</p>

<p>Q has given many clues to say that the Q theory is legit.</p>

<p>But is Q just part of a plan to pacify the masses? It seems that all the PAIN, BIG NEWS to come......just becomes a waiting game. Trust the process, etc etc. We get little nuggets of hope and excitement, but the &quot;bad actors&quot; continue on and don&#39;t go to jail.</p>

<p>I am not forming a complete opinion yet, but we must consider this as a massive Psyop. -- And then compare it with the Q story line.</p>

<p>Keep a level head folks. We (PATRIOTS) may need to rise up if indeed the Q team doesn&#39;t. How much longer do we wait....Mid Terms? (***I am a huge Trump supporter)</p>

<p>Have you ever read ALL of Q drops?</p>

<p>Have you gone back recently and reread Q drops with the knowledge &quot;Future Proves Past&quot;?</p>

<p>How do you explain the accuracy of past posts?</p>

<p>I think Q is legit.  Im open to being wrong though.  I went 6 months claiming Q as psyops but the future has proved the past and I encourage EVERYONE to reread EVERY Q post and think for yourselves</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody can read the future. Q has left about 1700 comments and mentioned hundreds of topics. So if basically any good news comes out for conservatives, you can point to some time Q mentioned the topic over the course of the last year. This isnt future proves past. It&#39;s not even a coincidence. It&#39;s just the fact that if you talk about current events for a year and make vague suggestions, eventually it will look like you knew somthing ahead of time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty easy to explain that they haven&#39;t really been very accurate. There has been a lot of really vague stuff that could apply to many different things. And there have been a lot of straight up inaccurate predictions. Like last October when Q predicted that Hillary Clinton&#39;s passport was going to be flagged, and then it wasn&#39;t. Or that a video of Hillary Clinton engaging in satanism/sex/something occult was going to come out in November of last year, and then it didn&#39;t. Or most recently when Q posted a faked picture from &quot;air force 1&quot;. </p>

<p>If Q was legit then he shouldn&#39;t get so many predictions wrong. It makes much much more sense that he is a larp or a troll. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I asked three questions you answered zero.  If you actually read the drops and in particular the Podesta getting arrested nov 3 with optics revealed november 4th you would see based on previous drops he wasnt talking about Podesta he was talking about SA Princes.</p>

<p>There are 365 days in a year.  He clearly states Nov 3 and Nov 4 it begins and coincidently with less than a 1% chance of being correct something major happened on those dates.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1 - i have read the majority of them until recently when they became more cheerleading than anything else. So, no, I have not read all ALL of Q drops.</p>

<p>2 - i have looked back the older posts, but the &quot;future proves past&quot; idea is the vaguery i was mentioning earlier. If you say something vague, it can apply to a lot of different events in the future. That&#39;s how fortune tellers and strip mall psychics make their living. You gave me a great example of that. Q said Podesta will be arrested on this day or that day, but he wasn&#39;t arrested. ever. So then you go back and say hmm it must ACTUALLY be about this other thing that isn&#39;t Podesta at all. </p>

<p>3 - i explained his accuracy, he isn&#39;t accurate. You didn&#39;t really even address the blatantly wrong/false predictions i mentioned above. </p>

<p>If Q has so much access to President Trump he wouldn&#39;t be so wrong, so often. He also wouldn&#39;t need to resort to tactics like being wrong on purpose (disinformation) if he is trying to help make people more aware of what is going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>It just makes very little sense that Q is real, and so so much sense that he is someone larping or trolling with enormous success.  </p>

<li><p>Yes. Future proves past is the same thing Nostradamus did. Q is a rainmaker. If you follow him and give hope, he promises to make it rain. If and when it does rain, you can proclaim &quot;FUTURE PROVES PAST&quot;. if and when it doesn&#39;t rain, the community come up with some reason as to why, such as &quot;disinfo is necessary&quot; &quot;Deep state sabotage&quot; &quot;they&#39;re hiding something&quot;.

<p>I see the Podestas are walking. He was wrong on that. </p>

<p>NK still being stubborn. Thought the deal was made? </p>

<p>The Air Force 1 picture that was completely debunked as fake. He said he was trolling? Really? </p>

<p>Obama is lawyered up back in January? What happened there? </p>

<p>Multiple EOs that were “already signed”.  Those never happened. </p>

<p>Multiple people were supposed to be arrested by now. Not. A. Single. Person. Has. Been. Arrested. </p>

<p>People twist is “code” to fit whatever event they want and claim it as “proof” when in reality there isn’t a single piece of verifiable proof out there. Only peoples version of his “code”. </p>

<p>Wait one minute.... Were the 12 Saudi Princes arrested?  Yes, yes they were.  Q had a 1 in 365 chance to correctly pick a major happening on that day.  He did. It also happens to have happened to the people up until that date were always mentioned first in Q posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I&#39;m 99% sure Q is legit, and not a LARP, in the traditional sense of the word.<br/>
However, your comment just brings me back to the, and I&#39;m reluctant to call anyone or anything this, but the genius move by Trump, to capture the &quot;Conspiracy Vote&quot;.<br/>
Who fucking knew that was a thing?  I didn&#39;t follow Trump during the election, in fact, I bought the MSM narrative hook, line, and sinker.<br/>
The Conspiracy Vote might have been enough to push Trump over the edge.  Hillary even tried a similar tactic with John Podesta and the whole UFO thing.  I propose that if Hillary had been more vocal about disclosing UFO secrets, it might have been enough to counter Trump&#39;s Conspiracy play, and given her the election.  Just my theory though.<br/>
Check out this video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2qIXXafxCQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2qIXXafxCQ</a>.  Even if you hate Trump, actually, especially if you hate Trump, you have to listen to what he says.  If you just watch the news, you&#39;ll just hear about his &quot;crazy musings&quot;.  But his fans and supporters get to hear the whole story.  He pretty much spells things out plainly, clear as day.  Look at his Twitter.  He says everything he is going to do.  He telegraphs everything.  It&#39;s pretty fucking crazy if you can take a step back, like I did, to consider the evidence.<br/>
Anyway, just my 2 cents. </p>

<p>I was never subscribed to a party line, but before the election, if you made me choose, I would say I most closely identified with Democratic/Liberal views.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q is definitely not a LARP. It&#39;s a self-admitted psyop. The only question is whether it&#39;s a &quot;We&#39;re going to invade France so we need to get the French people ready&quot; kind of psyop or the &quot;We need to keep the volatile right-leaning and free-thinking people corralled, at least for a while,&quot; kind of psyop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point, that&#39;s really the only question.  What is the endgame of Q?  Taking Q at his word, then the world very soon will be a much better place, and what it should have always been.<br/>
I frequently play d&#39;s advocate, and my opposing view is that the &quot;dark side&quot; has found a new, more powerful apprentice in Trump (no pun intended, or possibly even foreshadowing?), and what we are seeing is the fruition of the dark side&#39;s plan, and now the purge and destruction of the unnecessary rats/theives/deviants they no longer need.  In true biblical fashion, we are watching them reap the harvest of their evil deeds.  Crazy stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve already conceded a few logical points in my comments, if nothing else, points that someone with a clear mind must ask themselves, even if they are a &quot;Q reader&quot;, if you will.<br/>
My only answer to your reply to the other user, which will appear to bolster your argument, is that Q literally thought of everything.  &quot;Disinformation is real&quot;, &quot;Trust the plan&quot;, etc.  All things that can be quoted very quickly, without even considering what the other person is saying.  Slightly too convenient.  </p>

<p>Regarding the OIG report, there were plenty of damning things in there, that are moving things along.  A lot of things that were in the OIG report, were questions asked of Strzok.  We wouldn&#39;t have known about those things to ask about, if not for the OIG report.<br/>
He dropped a few bombshells in his answers too.  Stuff that is really deep in the weeds stuff, buried in an 8 hour interview.  For instance, he admitted that Ohr gave him the dossier.  It&#39;s a convoluted definition of &quot;dossier&quot; that was used, but things like that move the needle, ever so slowly, little by little.<br/>
If you look back at how far the needle&#39;s moved, it&#39;s actually quite extraordinary, and in my 20+ years of conspiratorial leanings, I never thought that the &quot;deep state&quot; or &quot;intricate machinations of government&quot; or &quot;new world order&quot;, if you prefer, would be this exposed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Follow Q loosely and have fun with it. All this drama about Q. Psyop? Cult? Christ. Why is everyone so dedicated to being all or nothing? I pay attention and if it pans out, awesome. If it doesn&#39;t, oh well, had some fun. I don&#39;t restrict myself from acting of my own will, yet I follow along in case. Is no one else capable of this balance? You choose your level of involvement. Its that easy. If you can&#39;t look at something without becoming obsessed with it, then you have no business in places that deal extensively with speculation. Man up, people. </p>
