    <div class="md"><p>not at all and when i explain why its relevant to what you said you&#39;ll probably see why. the plot revolves around a drug dealer delibrately poisoning her own product to extort heads of state into legalizing drugs, but oh ho the president decides &quot;fuck those druggies&quot; and imprisons them in ad hoc interment camps full of cells in sports stadiums to let them all die so that he can &quot;be the president that won the war on drugs&quot;. spoiler after the good guys win, the president is exposed and the cure administered, everyone just calmly, happily strolls out of their illegal and unconstitutional detainment and noone sues the government or their mindless agents who were just following orders. so you know, happy ending.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet internally you probably still hold disdain for those who talk about other theories you <strong>feel</strong> are unlikely.  Conspiracy theorists are used to this and don&#39;t need to be apologized to.  We we&#39;re mocked when we said the government was recording all our phone calls, we we&#39;re mocked when the cellular GPS mandate came out and we said the government was recording all our movements, we were mocked when we said microphones were always listening and web cams were always watching.</p>

<p>We are still mocked for insisting that there is a shadow government with global aspirations.  We are still mocked for insisting there is a global elite pedophile ring.  The later exists to ensure silence about the former.</p>

<p>We will continue to be mocked as we present theories to explain the observations we make.  Admittedly a theory is always 100% on target, with limited information you&#39;re always going to form a distorted picture.  But a distorted picture, if allowed to be discussed and refined will gain clarity and focus the closer those observers get to the target.  That distorted picture gets us closer, the whining and bitching from outsiders is intended to stop the progression.  The race baiters and character assassination is to shut down the refinement by associating individuals and the theories they present with offensive regressive topics.</p>

<p>Perhaps this one topic will allow you to see with a little more clarity, other topics you still mock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI, Snowden was only one whistleblower out of many. </p>

<p>William Binney (Former high level NSA analyst, also whistleblower pre-Snowden): “At least 80% of fibre-optic cables globally go via the US”, Binney said. “This is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in. At least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US.

<p>How the US and other nations skirt laws against domestic spying:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Britain&#39;s GCHQ intelligence agency can spy on anyone but British nationals, the NSA can conduct surveillance on anyone but Americans, and Germany&#39;s BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst) foreign intelligence agency can spy on anyone but Germans. That&#39;s how a matrix is created of boundless surveillance in which each partner aids in a division of roles. <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/secret-documents-nsa-targeted-germany-and-eu-buildings-a-908609.html">http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/secret-documents-nsa-targeted-germany-and-eu-buildings-a-908609.html</a></p></li>

<p>Under the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 protocol, and adopted into U.S. law, the U.S. must recognize refugees that fear persecution and are not able to get help from their home country.    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/asylum-seekers-us-border/story?id=54835812">Source</a>.   </p>

<p>Under the law, anyone seeking asylum into the US must be processed to understand whether the asylum application is credible, you can enter the country illegally, but still be in the country legally if you are seeking asylum.  Even if you enter the country illegally, you have one year to request asylum: <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum">USCIS.gov</a>.  Essentially, they broke the law to enter the country, but they are legally allowed to be in the country now that they are here.  They are legal immigrants.  </p>

<p>This makes things difficult.  It&#39;s a loophole.  Asylum seekers are in the country legally, but broke the law to get here.  Under the Obama administration, the initial broken law (entering the country illegally) was treated as a civil offense.  Under the Trump &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy, the initial broken law is treated as a criminal offense.  Since this is now treated as a criminal offense, they parents need to go to jail while the asylum application is processed.  The government can&#39;t send the children back to Mexico (since the children and parents are in the country legally), and there is rarely a guardian in the US... so concentration camps.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a fucked up system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. The literal definition has nothing to do with killing. Your assumption is most likely based off the connotational meaning when used in context of WWII camps. Everyone who is claiming they are not concentration camps has never googled &quot;define concentration camp&quot;. Might just enlighten you to the rhetorical meaning which many colloquially assume is genocide or death camps. A concentration camp can lead to death, but not necessarily.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jaime Garcia, the shelter’s program director, told reporters on the tour: &quot;All the kids have been able to talk to their parents.&quot;</p>

<p>They were shown a room with pool tables and children playing computer football games. Some watched the film Moana dubbed into Spanish.</p>

<p>Some were being taught in temporary classrooms.</p>

<p>Outside there were basketball courts and a football field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This does not sound like a concentration camp to me.</p>

<p>Im not a Trump supporter but people are completely over reacting to this.  How else do you deter people from illegal boarder crossing, which is horrible for the economy.  Before they made the current law, if you got caught you simply got sent to imigration services and brought back to Mexico basically.  So you could just keep attempting to illegally enter the country with no real reprecussions. </p>

<p>If folks don&#39;t want to be separated from their children, just don&#39;t try to cross the border illegally.</p>

<p>Except no, I didn&#39;t. He committed a crime and I was put into foster care. I didn&#39;t have any contact with my dad for like 6 years. </p>

<p>I feel for these people trying to leave their country to come to America, given their situation I&#39;d probably do the same, but a crime is a crime. Illegally crossing a border is no less a crime than illegally ingesting a substance. And honestly, these kids have it decent comparatively. They could have been sent back to their country alone without family, or put in a real Nazi Germany or North Korean concentration camp. </p>

<p>Comparatively, I&#39;d rather have their childhood than my own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Concentration camps are OK as long as the prisoners held without due process are treated relatively well.&quot; They&#39;re political prisoners, locked up due to their nationality, and they&#39;re denied constitutional rights and due process, but I&#39;m supposed to be OK with it just because the political prisoners arent being tortured or killed or something? You&#39;re gross. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If one was going to hide FEMA camps in plain sight, Wal-Marts are a good candidate.  Placed on major thoroughfares and everyone knows where the nearest one is.  Alot of people know someone who has worked at one.  Alot of psychological barriers to obeying when people are told <strong><em>&quot;report to the nearest Wal-Mart for citizenship processing&quot;</em></strong> are already broken.  Wal-Marts all have fairly standard architectural design so troops/guards can learn a new post earlier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good on you for admitting you shouldn’t have mocked people.  However, my understanding of the facts is that it is in no way a concentration camp.  At most it’s a processing center.  Also, the Walmart concentration camp people said the camps were for US.  Clearly, they are not for us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not at all and when i explain why its relevant to what you said you&#39;ll probably see why. the plot revolves around a drug dealer delibrately poisoning her own product to extort heads of state into legalizing drugs, but oh ho the president decides &quot;fuck those druggies&quot; and imprisons them in ad hoc interment camps full of cells in sports stadiums to let them all die so that he can &quot;be the president that won the war on drugs&quot;. spoiler after the good guys win, the president is exposed and the cure administered, everyone just calmly, happily strolls out of their illegal and unconstitutional detainment and noone sues the government or their mindless agents who were just following orders. so you know, happy ending.</p>
