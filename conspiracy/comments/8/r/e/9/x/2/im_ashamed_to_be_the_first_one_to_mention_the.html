        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s essentially a U.K style blanket ban on all substances that have psychoactive effects comparable to any scheduled substances. They use vague legalese statements such as... </p>

<ul>
<li>Any &quot;chemical  structure that is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a  controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V; and&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;an actual <strong>or predicted</strong>  stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous  system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant,  depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a  controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V;&quot;<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like pretty average totalitarianism that gives them the right to ban every unscheduled analogue of an illegal drug and has effects comparable to one (Caffeine would fall in this category as being stimulating in the same way Cocaine and Amphetamine is). Where they crossed the line and completely disregarded any attempt of reasonably constructing the legislation  is they used the word PREDICTED in reference to the effects a chemical has.   </p>

<p>Who gets to decide what a prediction is? Can Jeff Sessions just wake up and decide Vitamin C might be psychedelic and schedule it? Can he bump his head and become deluded to the level where he can become convinced that any random substance might have some sort of no-no effect and schedule it? Can an average shitposting troll make a fancy looking blog article about why some random compound might be able to do something like a drug and influence the DEA/FDA to prohibit it for the lulz?  </p>

<p>Where does this shit end? Because a blanket ban on Research Chemicals seems like it should be the end of it, but who would be able to predict if they&#39;ll eventually get inspired to crack down on gardening supplies?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They just banned certain substances that caused a ruckus, like fentanyl/spice/bath salts. If you understood what was being said in the two quotes from the bill I provided, you would know that this has not happened before. This is the final move to Ban anything that produces effects comparable to any scheduled substances (Caffeine and Cocaine are both stimulants, so this bill would give Sessions the right to scedule caffeine as a drug with a 10-15 year sentence for possessing or distributing )or that has &quot;predicted&quot; intoxicating effects. The word PREDICTED is where this shit disregards all integrity, because what exactly is the consensus on what evidence a prediction needs in order to back it up? None was given, so I predict that it could mean they could schedule whatever the fuck they want due to someone somewhere thinking it may or may not intoxicate you to some sort of degree we don&#39;t care enough about to confirm any validity on whoever predicted this and to what degree the presumed predictor even thought the claim was possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look up MXE, they fucking annihilated it&#39;s very existence. The highly agreed upon top choice that some people would consider tradiing their nutsack for if any was found. It&#39;s entirely gone from every entity on earth that would be willing to sell it to countries it still remains unscheduled in. The extinction of it is due to nothing other it&#39;s legal status in the USA as well as some other countries  where it was produced.</p>
