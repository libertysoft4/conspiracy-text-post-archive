        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So lets get started, </p>

<p>Hal Puthoff had a conference and gave a very compelling speech on June 17th,</p>

<p>First let us see the credentials of Dr.Puthoff</p>

<p>&gt; Dr. Harold E. Puthoff is the co-founder and Vice President of Science and Technology of TTS Academy. Since 1985, Dr. Puthoff has served as President and CEO of EarthTech International, Inc. (ETI), and Director of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin (IASA). He has published numerous papers on electron-beam devices, lasers and space propulsion and has patents issued in the laser, communications, and energy fields. <strong>Dr. Puthoff’s professional background spans more than five decades of research at General Electric, Sperry, the National Security Agency, Stanford University and SRI International.</strong> Dr. Puthoff regularly advises NASA , the Department of Defense and intelligence communities, corporations and foundations on leading-edge technologies and future technology trends. He earned his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1967 and won a Who’s Who Lifetime Achievement in 2017 that recognizes individuals that have achieved greatness in their industry and have excelled in their field for at least 20 years.</p>

<p>Now I am going to cherrypick you the most interesting bits, and will link the full speech at the end (you should really read it, what is worth your time more than fucking DISCLOSURE)</p>

<p>&gt; “Tim Dinsdale Memorial Award recognizing significant contributions to the expansion of human understanding through the study of unexplained phenomena.  To Harold Puthoff for the application of sound scientific principles and methodologies to the study of remote perception; quantum, zero-point fluctuations; and unidentified aerial objects, and for recognizing the potential usefulness of these often-shunned phenomena in the real world.” </p>

<p>---</p>

<p>&gt;  <strong>Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, I have not published anything in. Why? Because the program I was involved in, in the Pentagon and in the intelligence community has been Top Secret, behind-the-scenes and only recently has there been release of information about the program.  So this is the first chance that I’ve had a chance to actually appear before the public and speak about details of the program and not go to jail</strong> </p>

<p>------------</p>

<p>&gt; B<strong>ack a couple of decades ago Peter Sturrock – one of our founding members of SSE – arranged with (Laurance) Rockefeller to hold a weeklong workshop at the Rockefeller residence. We brought in the best of the UFO researchers, and then a panel of independent experts, and had a weeklong discussion of physical evidence related to UFO objects of which there’s a significant amount of data. Laurance Rockefeller hosted the whole thing. It was a wonderful meeting.</strong> </p>

<p>--------------</p>

<p>&gt; <strong>However, of course the government is also no stranger to the UFO phenomena. Anyone who follows the field would be familiar with Project Sign, Grudge and Blue Book, but in 1969 the Condon Committee shut it all down and said, really we don’t need to be involved in this area any more. We’re not learning anything. We’re not getting anywhere. It’s not clear this is a significant area. So for the average person on the street, that’s where it all kind of ended, at least serious government interest. In fact, that’s not true.</strong></p>

<p>&gt;The very memo that shut down Blue Book written by General Bolender had as part of its language, “Reports of UFOs which could affect national security would continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedures designed for this purpose.”</p>

<p>-------------</p>

<p>&gt; Ex-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is the one who initiated the program. Top-rated F-18 pilots who encountered Advanced Aerospace Vehicles at close range were permitted to come forward and tell their stories, which up till now they hadn’t because they didn’t want to lose their flight status by reporting what they had found, at least publicly.  And a number of significant Department of Defense and intelligence community officials have come forward to talk about the reality of this phenomena and the fact that there were programs going on. The program was nicknamed Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). People have had trouble trying to get documents out of the Pentagon by saying they want all documents on AATIP, and they have a hard time because that wasn’t the actual name of the program. “Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems Application Program” is the actual name of the program. But AATIP was the nickname it went by. </p>

<p>--------------------------------------</p>

<p>&gt; <strong>It began in June of 2007. The Defense Intelligence Agency was concerned about the fact that obvious observation had shown that Advanced Aerospace Vehicles – crafts, or drones of unknown origin, were flying all over the United States, over waters, in fact globally as was the case.</strong> </p>

<p>-------------------</p>

<p>&gt; There is a two-fold nature to the threat. First of all, you’ve got these Advanced Aerospace Vehicles flying around that we don’t know where they come from, who’s driving them, what the intent is – possibly off-world even. But the future threat, was actually as far as the Department of Defense went and the intelligence community, one of the greater concerns. What happens if potential adversaries achieve significant breakthroughs by getting hold of advanced technology either based on their study of the phenomena, or from sensor data, or from crash retrieved materials?  That could provide a problem for the United States in the sense of threat. There’s reason to be concerned about that. <strong>This is a document in the program we dug up out of the Soviet Union (“</strong>Thread-3”). It’s a very thick document. It shows that the Soviet Union had a massive program also trying to get to the root of all of this. In this document a number of research institutes and military institutes are listed. Of course, they had the same concerns we did. Is there a threat from the phenomena or might the Americans make headway before us and that be a threat?*** *******</p>

<p>----------------------</p>

<p>&gt; <strong>Back in November of 2004, the Nimitz Carrier Group was out on patrol off of San Diego, and on several occasions an Advanced Aerospace Vehicle would descend rapidly from 60,000 feet to 50 feet in seconds, then hover, and then take off like a bullet. When it first happened and happened over a number of weeks actually, two F-18 pilots were vectored on to the site where they were being observed by the radars to investigate, and what they saw was what they called a “Tic-Tac craft” – solid white, smooth, no edges, about 46-feet in length, uniformly colored, no nacelles, pylons or wings. The F-18’s could not obtain lock with their radars because they were stealthy, but Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) could pick them up to some degree based on their heat signatures. The Advanced Aerospace Vehicle appeared to demonstrate advanced acceleration, aerodynamic and propulsion capability beyond anything that we knew existed on the planet.</strong> </p>

<p>-----------------</p>

<p>&gt; <strong>Now you might ask yourself, what can you prove from a videotape? I mean, you can see videotapes all over the Internet and so on. But this was data fusion. They are gun-camera tapes. There are these videotapes from the pilots, voice recordings, data link recordings from Aegis and many other military platforms, expert witnesses. So, in fact, the data density – and this is what’s changed the field a lot – our detection capability has gotten so advanced that we’re losing our inability to see exactly what’s going on.</strong> </p>

<p>------------------------</p>

<p>&gt; So, I let out 38 contracts over a two-year period. I’ll show you what the studies were on. You can read them there: positron aerospace propulsion, IEC fusion as a compact energy source, warp drive, dark energy, extra dimensions, metallic glasses for aerospace use. Really cutting edge kinds of things.</p>

<p>&gt;Here are some more of the papers that I commissioned: negative mass propulsion, antigravity for aerospace applications, programmable matter, invisibility cloaking – these are just the kind of things that we needed to have maximum technical input from the best people around the globe. And so, that’s what we did, that’s what I did.</p>

<p>---------------</p>

<p>THIS IS AN EXPLANATION OF RECOVERED MATERIALS FROM A UFO</p>

<p>&gt; It was a multilayered bismuth and magnesium sample. Bismuth layers less than a human hair. Magnesium samples about ten-times the size of a human hair. Supposedly picked up in the crash retrieval of an Advanced Aerospace Vehicle. It looks like it’s been in a crash. The white lines are the bismuth; the darker areas are the magnesium separations. So the question was what about this material, so naturally we looked in all the national labs, we talked to metallurgists, we combed the entire structure of published papers. Nowhere could we find any evidence that anybody ever made one of these.</p>

<p>&gt;Secondly, some attempts were made to try to reproduce this material, but they couldn’t get the bismuth and magnesium layers to bond.</p>

<p>&gt;Thirdly, when we talked to people in the materials field who should know, they said we don’t know why anybody would want to make anything like this. It’s not obvious that it has any function.</p>

<p>&gt;Well, years later, decades later actually, finally our own science moves along. We move into an area called metamaterials, and it turns out exactly this combination of materials at exactly those dimensions turn out to be an excellent microscopic waveguide for very high frequency electromagnetic radiation terahertz frequencies. So, the wavelength is 60 microns, which is a pretty small size. But it turns out because of the metamaterial aspect of this material, those bismuth layers that act as waveguides can be one twentieth the size of the wavelength, and usually when you make a waveguide it’s gotta be about the size of the wavelength. So, in fact this turned out to be a material that would propagate sub-wavelength waveguide effects. Why somebody wants to do that we still don’t know the answer to that.</p>

<p>--------------------------</p>

<p>THIS IS AN EXPLANATION OF A FACTUAL AND SCIENTIFIC METHOD OF FASTER THAN LIGHT TRAVEL</p>

<p>&gt;I’ll pick a second one here for the engineers or physicists in the crowd. Probably be more interesting – spacetime metric engineering. This happens to be the paper that I myself provided. One of the questions is: can the reported anomalous observables of these Advanced Aerospace Vehicles be accounted for on the basis of known physics? You hear people describing craft taking right angle turns at high speeds, other things with the hovering and rapid acceleration and so on, as if the craft didn’t have any inertial mass. Well, it turns out although Einstein’s general relativity is usually used in astrophysical applications and gravity studies and so on, you can look at it from an engineering standpoint. So, if you take an engineering approach to general relativity, what I just showed can be understood. If you could change the spacetime metric the way general relativity – I’m talking about textbook, not some fanciful physics – you could even get faster-than-light travel. Alcubierre warp drive as in Star Trek. Again, you might think that’s a fanciful kind of thing, but that paper was published in one of the top general relativity journals, Miguel Alcubierre, “<em>The Warp Drive: Hyper-Fast Travel within General Relativity,” Classical and Quantum Gravity</em> (11:L73-L77,1994). So, if you engineer spacetime metric, you can begin to line up observables with physics that we know and love even if we can’t reproduce it.</p>

<p>&gt;What about the velocity of light constraint? People are always saying that. How could you have a wormhole that lets you go from one side of the universe to the other? Aren’t you beating the speed of light? What does the physicist and engineer mean by the speed of light? He means this little equation here where the speed of light is given by 1 over the square root of the permittivity times the permeability of the vacuum. So the point is if you reengineer those vacuum parameters, then you can make the effective speed of light higher in the engineered region.  Those are the solutions in general relativity that are called wormholes, and again, it’s not science fiction. This is just right-off-the-shelf, standard text book general relativity applications.</p>

<p>&gt;So, what that means is a reduced time interstellar travel is not as skeptics would say, “You can’t get from there to here.” Advanced ET civilizations now, or ourselves in the future are not fundamentally constrained by physical principals. The exotic physics for such can be addressed in engineering terms – some metric engineering as it were. Does this have any help? Again, by the way, this paper was also published as one of the Defense Intelligence Agency’s reference documents. And since we are permitted to publish in the open literature, I published that paper in a British interplanetary science journal, an engineering journal, so if you’re interested in looking at the details, you can learn as much as you want to know about metric engineering. (Advanced Space Propulsion Based on Vacuum (Spacetime Metirc) Engineering, H. Puthoff (2010), Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, 63, 82-89.)</p>

<p>---------------------</p>

<p>&gt; <strong>Well, that helped us to understand. We as part of this program looked at some cases that were really good from Brazil. In 1977, 78, it was like</strong>*** Close Encounters of the Third Kin**<em>**d. A thousand pages of documents all done by the Brazilian Air Force investigative team, 500 photographs, 15 hours of motion film, a lot of medical injuries. This is a list of the different kinds of medical injuries that occurred when people encountered these craft at close range, and it has some overlap with cases that we’ve investigated during the program, of injuries occurring</em>*. </p>

<p>-----------------</p>

<p>THIS EXPLAINS WHY THEY ARE ASKING FOR PUBLIC INVESTORS (hint:its not to fucking scam a few shekels out of conspiracy theorists)  </p>

<p>&gt; <strong>And let’s face it, advocacy of this issue in government circles is not viewed as career enhancing in part because, despite the weirdness of the subject, if you don’t make a lot of progress, you know, it doesn’t look good on your resume that you’re moving up the line.</strong></p>

<p>&gt;So, because of that, there’s a forward story. <strong>Many of us involved in the program decided that there should be an outreach program in the public sector.</strong> So this is the forward story. The goal was to establish a broad-based, high-quality scientific community-of-interest in the public sector concerning these Unidentified Aerial Phenomena and other related leading-edge topics. And so we got together and formed a company called, To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science. It was cofounded by entrepreneur Tom DeLonge – I’ll talk about him in a minute – senior intelligence officers from the Department of Defense and CIA and distinguished research scientists. We all banded together to form this academy. It was set up as a public benefit corporation so the public can invest and therefore it’s owned by the public. So this is something new. Whatever comes out of any of the research or any of the releases of information is actually going to be owned by the public.  It is not going to disappear into a black hole. A very transparent structure, if you go to the website you can see everything from the financial structure to the activities, and we do have a web-based community-of-interest where things get posted.** For example, the F-18 FLIR tape I showed, we now have three of them up there and probably more to come**.</p>

<p>-------------------</p>

<p>HERE IS AN EXPLANATION OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT (and how Tom Delonge is involved)</p>

<p>&gt; Alright, who are the principals of this organization? Tom DeLonge, Blink 182 rock star. Frankly, I’d never heard of Blink 182, but my son told me, “Oh yeah, we know about Blink 182.” But anyway, in addition to being the rock star that he is, he’s also a director and producer, puts out books and music and film and so on, and he’s had a lifelong interest in the UFO area. So, he started talking with various people and he was kind of the I guess you could say the action-oriented person, who said “Why don’t you set up something. Why don’t we make this more available to the public?” and he got to a number of us, and so we all began to band together. Lou Elizondo, who was in fact the Department of Defense’s, the Pentagon’s AATIP program director resigned from the Pentagon and joined us.</p>

<p>&gt;Chris Mellon, 20-year career, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Minority Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, he joined us. We got Jim Semivan, 25-year career and CIA’s Director of Operation. He was the real James Bond kind of guy. Steve Justice just retired as program director for the billion-dollar programs at Lockheed Martin Skunk Works. He joined us.</p>

<p>&gt;And then, I agreed to be on the Board. So, I joined them. In addition to my science and engineering background, I’ve had a lot of activity in classified areas so it was a natural fit for me interacting with all these people.</p>

<p>&gt;We also put together a policy and scientific advisory panel of the best people we could find. Chris Mellon agreed to be the Chair. Dr. Colm Kelleher, he was actually the deputy administrator at Bigelow Aerospace to run the AATIP program out of the Pentagon. Dr. Gary Nolan, top genetics professor at Stanford University. Dr. Kahn, 30 year career with the CIA counter biological weapons program. Dr. Rapp, professor of military and emergency medicine, Uniform Services University. Dr. Gilpin, consultant on academic biomedical research and research law.</p>

<p>&gt;So, we put together a team as panelists to keep us on the straight and narrow of really top people who have wonderful backgrounds and really want to see scientific work be done in this area.</p>

<p>------------------</p>

<p>&gt; The structure of the organization has a science structure, an aerospace structure, and an entertainment division. What are the activities of this organization to date? <strong>Actually we were responsible for legitimizing the topic in the mainstream press. That story that came out in</strong>*** Th<strong><em>e</em></strong> New Yor<strong><em>k</em></strong> Time<em>**s</em>* and so on, which then got picked up by th<strong>e</strong>* Washington Pos**<em>**t, CNN, Fox News, was based on agreed-upon interviews with those of us I’ve just gone through a list of. And given the quality of sources coming out from the shadows, for example Ex-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, top F-18 pilots, significant Department of Defense and intelligence community officials, the bar has been raised on the legitimization of this topic in the public arena.  We think that’s an accomplished goal to date</em>*.</p>

<p>&gt;And via the community-of-interest postings on the website, <strong>we now have three high quality F-18 video tapes of unidentified aerial phenomena encounters. They’ve been previously languishing in the Pentagon servers, nobody doing that much with them. These are still being generated. One of the tapes is from 2016 off the East Coast of the United States. There are a lot more tapes. Hopefully we’ll get a lot more of them posted.</strong></p>

<p>------------------------</p>

<p>&gt; Meetings are being set up with people from other countries because other countries, who also have materials, don’t necessarily want to give them to the U.S. Government because they disappear into a black hole and they never learn anything. But given our commitment as a public benefit corporation, that’s not gonna happen with us. They are now talking to us and we are collaborating on obtaining materials from foreign countries.</p>

<p>&gt;We are negotiating with media outlets to get all this out in the public in the form of documentaries or TV shows, whatever. So basically that’s the back story, the forward story and I’m glad to answer any questions. I’ll answer any I can.</p>

<p>------------------</p>

<p>&gt; <strong>That’s a fair concern.  This 22 million dollar program was one particular program. That does not say that there were not other programs with other funding levels. It isn’t like, suddenly there was this one program that did not last long and did not have that much money and it shut down.</strong></p>

<p>&gt;<strong>Interest is continuing. Negotiations are continuing. The programs are being looked at. A lot is going on.  I and my colleagues spend a lot of time in Washington talking to committees that are looking at this from many different angles.  So the general view that, “Oh, it was just one program that came forward and didn’t provide much of value and then it got cancelled . . .”. That’s not really the case.</strong></p>

<p>But since you asked.</p>

<p>UFOs have been visiting earth since the 40s, this is a fact.</p>

<p>We have recovered advanced metamaterials from crash sites, this is a fact</p>

<p>IN 2016, the US Navy encountered a FLEET of UFOs off the cost of San Diego this is a fact.</p>

<p>The Materials recovered in the 40s from UFO crashsites is still not fully understood in 2018, it is extremely complex and we do not its purpose.</p>

<p>BASICALLY ALIENS ARE REAL WOO-HOO</p>

<p>This should honestly be pinned</p>

<p>They are currently preparing a</p>

<p>&quot;Comprehensive media education project&quot;</p>

<p>This company was already featured on the NYtimes,Fox,NBC,CNN ect for getting 3 authentic videos of UFOs declassified by the DOD.</p>

<p>So I can only imagine this stuff relating to recovered wreckage and more specific and juicy details are whats in this Media Education Project meaning DISCLOSURE WILL BE TELEVISED</p>

<p>Its fucking real, </p>

<p>I would also like to mention this company has announced they are currently working on recreating the technology that goes into this craft and then releasing it into the public domain (Anti-Gravity, Exotic Energy, who knows what else)</p>

<p>This is either FULL ON we gon get that Sci-fi technology very soon and all sorts of hidden knowledge</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s go down the deep state path just a little.</p>

<p>Can you explain why we have had to wait so long? During which time the planetary wealth inequality skyrocketed and the military industrial complex flourished? This sudden corporate invention of disclosure feels the opposite of democratic-open-organic - it feels crypto-technocratic in the extreme.</p>

<p>Another tricky question. Apparently the human species needed to essentially create an international technological super-organism composed of interlocking corporate, academic, industrial, and governmental entities in order to understand and begin to manipulate ET capabilities such as faster-than-light travel. But how do they do it? Where are their factories and research centers? How many brains do they have allocated to it? What&#39;s their organizational structure look like? What principles guide their social relationships with each other and outsiders?</p>

<p>Why would it matter? &quot;Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying these considerations cannot be addressed, just that they haven&#39;t been addressed yet in all these years.</p>

<p>Free energy in a democratically structured society, where everyone has access to the comfort that implies, is a great step forward. But nobody seems to be concentrating on the ramifications of tech inequality. If it takes a Skunk Works level of expertise and infrastructure to replicate it, we seem to be shifting masters rather than freeing ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Another tricky question. Apparently the human species needed to essentially create an international technological super-organism composed of interlocking corporate, academic, industrial, and governmental entities in order to understand and begin to manipulate ET capabilities such as faster-than-light travel. But how do &quot;they-the-ETs&quot; do it? Where are their factories and research centers? How many brains do they have allocated to it? What&#39;s their organizational structure look like? What principles guide their social relationships with each other and outsiders?&quot;</p>

<p>This made me think maybe ETs have to prep a planet for disclosure, and maybe that takes many decades. Maybe they operate by planet hopping (or system hopping), using resources from each system to expand, but as you pointed out, maybe they need complex social systems in order to feed their expansion. Like it&#39;s not good enough to just come here and mine gold, maybe they need high technology and they need it at planetary scale in order to accomplish their mission. So sudden disclosure and imparting of knowledge might not work for what they need, so they cultivate the planet before disclosure..</p>

<p>I&#39;m spitballing here, so please bear with me... Let&#39;s look back beyond the 1940&#39;s. </p>

<p>-The distant past: UFOs are treated as mythical or divine objects. The best evidence we have is in religious themed painting or word-of-mouth. There is no communications technology to speak of. The world is literally divided into sovereign fiefdoms, ruled by the whims of aristocratic families. What would happen if ETs disclosed themselves? If it was large scale, they would probably be regarded as divine and be asked to take over. Small scale, they would be a threat to the aristocratic families wherever they landed and would potentially be taken out through attrition if they could be cut off from supply lines.</p>

<p>-Pre-modern age: Orson Wells War of the Worlds: 1938. So ok, it was officially explained as a hoax, but maybe it was an experiment to gauge humanity&#39;s reaction to an ET disclosure and we collectively just kind of assumed it was an invasion and reacted accordingly. Earth culture at the time was slightly more unified than in the past. We also had mass communications through radio and pretty good first-hand knowledge of the world through the last of the great explorers like Earhart and Lindbergh. But we still don&#39;t have high technology. No superconductors or digital tech to speak of. It&#39;s mostly if not entirely analog.</p>

<p>-1940&#39;s and &#39;50&#39;s: Roswell, Foo fighters of WW2 and Korea, Flying saucers enter the mainstream imagination. We have pretty decent mass communications, for broadcast anyway. Radio is mature, TV is just beginning. These are the tools needed to really seed a non-hostile perception of ET across the globe. Culture-wise we still have sovereign nations. There is perhaps enough cohesion to bootstrap technology and industry, but it&#39;s not global yet. Technology in production use is still analog. My thinking here is that a disclosure would potentially damage our motivation to build out a global system useful for the ETs. We are still at the stage where we can imagine technology but not necessarily how to use it effectively.</p>

<p>-1960&#39;s and 1970&#39;s: Moon landing and ICBMs, and the birth of modern microscale computing. Now we are rolling. We almost have the tools to go global, but not quite. Communications technology is still broadcast. But our science and technology, having been seeded by ET tech in the 40&#39;s, 50&#39;s, and 60&#39;s, is starting to gain momentum. Again, I think disclosure at this point has the potential to kill the momentum, as we would get an influx of knowledge but not the wisdom to use it to grow. We would be an ET cargo cult at this point if there was a disclosure. On the international scene, the world gets a little smaller as nations begin to coalesce into conglomerates like the EU, Nato and Warsaw Pact, African Union, etc. Also of note, trans-national corporations based on technology and energy start to build momentum as the first post-national entities with power to influence the course of nations, at least in small scale.</p>

<p>-1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s: The internet emerges. The world has 2-way communication at scale for the first time. Technology explodes. It&#39;s still very much confined to a small group of elite people though. Mostly universities and big corporations, especially those involved in defense. The cultural mindset is still not quite ready for disclosure, due to the wide gap between the knowledge haves and have nots.</p>

<p>-2000&#39;s to present: The old models of nations and supranational unions begin to dissolve. There is a point where multi-way communications via the internet becomes mainstream, and it is no longer weird to include your company&#39;s web address on advertisements. Then the web suddenly becomes everything. In terms of technology, humans are ready for disclosure, however, we are not quite a global society yet. We are at the point where the ETs can ask the question, &quot;If we disclose our presence, does humanity have the momentum to continue our mission of building a global resource producing society (in the sense of producing resources the ETs need to continue expansion, at the scale needed)?&quot;. Or would disclosure cause us to implode and devolve back down the chain? </p>

<p>Unless there is a pressing need to disclose, it might be better to wait a few years. Clearly the ETs are patient, they&#39;ve been prepping us for centuries at this point. The question becomes is the sudden boom of growth inevitably following disclosure enough to become self-sustaining, or would it be more prudent to wait?</p>

<p>But my intentionally contrary question was &quot;how do we know this will be good for our species?&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s no reciprocity. The only thing we seem to have that they want is tissue samples so far. It&#39;s clear that every possible story has them knowing far more about us than vice versa. Does that imply honest negotiations or terms of surrender?</p>

<p>It&#39;s also clear that the era of the ET has coincided with the era of modern conspiracy and all the misdirection, social turmoil, inequality, and power-grabbing by secret cabals we report to each other on this site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh.. well any contact with ET will not be good for our species, in my opinion. There&#39;s only really a handful of outcomes, even the best of which is not that great.</p>

<ol>
<li>We are their food - obvious why this is bad</li>
<li>We are their slaves - ditto -- bad</li>
<li>We are a research experiment - not bad but not awesome to find this out</li>
<li>They want to help us - I would have a hard time believing they would do this for free. What&#39;s the catch?</li>

<li><p>Slaves - again probably not, because there&#39;s no clue they don&#39;t have anything a slave would be good for - except maybe sex(?)</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment - Possible, but would fit in well with any of these possibilities - it is a good option for them as a project&#39;s first stage - like hunters scouting, or the standard blood tests Doctors give. </p></li>
<li><p>Help - but implying Trade - Sure - one would expect this in any good science fiction story about planetary civilizations bumping into each other (though they would both have their own spaceship bridges in the scene).

<li><p>Help - without preconditions - wow. Seems the only reason they might do that is if we are they, in the Hollywood classic turnabout when beings from the past or future show up in our present to help us out...</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The Drake Equation has many different answers. We can even only speculate on some of the numbers that go into the equation. The numbers can range dramatically, some of which are very optimistic.</p>

<p>As for the Fermi Paradox, there are many, many answers for that as well. Many of which include the possibility of aliens.</p>

<p>Just because we haven&#39;t been told aliens have visited us, doesn&#39;t mean they haven&#39;t, especially when you take UFO sightings and abduction reports into account.</p>

<p>And even if our government or scientists don&#39;t <em>know</em> we&#39;re being visited by aliens or haven&#39;t found a way to detect or communicate with other civilizations doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t there.</p>

<p>It&#39;s entirely possible and likely we just don&#39;t have the technology or knowledge needed to detect those civilizations, even if those civilizations are all over the damn place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about these guys?  </p>

<p>&gt;Lou Elizondo, who was in fact the Department of Defense’s, the Pentagon’s AATIP program director resigned from the Pentagon and joined us.</p>

<p>&gt;Chris Mellon, 20-year career, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Minority Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, he joined us. We got Jim Semivan, 25-year career and CIA’s Director of Operation. He was the real James Bond kind of guy. Steve Justice just retired as program director for the billion-dollar programs at Lockheed Martin Skunk Works. He joined us.</p>

<p>&gt;And then, I agreed to be on the Board. So, I joined them. In addition to my science and engineering background, I’ve had a lot of activity in classified areas so it was a natural fit for me interacting with all these people.</p>

<p>&gt;We also put together a policy and scientific advisory panel of the best people we could find. Chris Mellon agreed to be the Chair. Dr. Colm Kelleher, he was actually the deputy administrator at Bigelow Aerospace to run the AATIP program out of the Pentagon. Dr. Gary Nolan, top genetics professor at Stanford University. Dr. Kahn, 30 year career with the CIA counter biological weapons program. Dr. Rapp, professor of military and emergency medicine, Uniform Services University. Dr. Gilpin, consultant on academic biomedical research and research law.</p>

<p>&gt;So, we put together a team as panelists to keep us on the straight and narrow of really top people who have wonderful backgrounds and really want to see scientific work be done in this area.</p>

<p>What about them?</p>

<p>A) They’re only a piece of the puzzle - not the entire thing.</p>

<p>B) Delonge’s interpretation of the limited material he’s been given is itself flawed.</p>

<p>As Grant Cameron said, Delonge and Greer both are two different spectrums of the equation, and both are a bit skewed.  Greer thinks all ETs are good - which is false.  <em>Some</em> are good (relative to humanity, of course).  Some aren’t.  Delonge, on the other hand, has apparently had a bit of a “ETs will invade like on Independence Day!” bent, which is also wrong - as some ETs have no interest in harming humanity (quite the opposite, in fact).</p>

<p>Take Delonge’s information in, but, again, realize that he is in absolutely no way whatsoever any type of ET “voice” that should be listened to exclusive to all others.</p>

<p>No one’s voice on ETs should be looked upon as that, as a matter of fact.  Everyone just has pieces of the puzzle right now.  Take them all in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greer hasnt done shit in a decade</p>

<p>Delonge got the PENTAGON to release 3 declassified video of real encounters with UFOs </p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>Got the fighter pilot who encountered those UFOs to agree to do a public interview</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>has been featured on MSM regularly and is preparing to release non-fiction documentaries and books on this topic</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>Has Lockheed Martins HEAD OF RESEARCH AND ADVANCED PROGRAMS onboard and has publicly stated his goal to be to create a functional example of an anti-gravity ship, and then make that technology public domain</p>

<p>This Company formed last October.</p>

<p>Greer is Wilcox tier and Delonge is literally making history</p>

<p>That last part is not even debatable.</p>

<p>The Pentagon had NEVER acknowledged the reality of UFOs until Delonge and his team got involved</p>

<p>And I get your point about the whole he views them a threats thing.</p>

<p>But there is no evidence whatsoever of their intentions</p>

<p>imagine you have a house and some body builder mute did just sneaks in through the windows whenever he feels like it, and you know he could easily beat you up and take your shit, but he just watches you, and never says a word and runs away faster than you can catch him to inevitably return</p>

<p>It is about being prepared if we do encounter hostiles</p>

<p>Dude.  Like I said before, he only has pieces of the puzzle.  I actually <em>did</em> acknowledge your points by simply acknowledging that ETs <em>do</em> exist, have always existed, have existed longer than we have, and that some are good, and some are bad.</p>

<p>And?  Tom Delonge has exactly <em>zero</em> to do with the exclusive understanding of that information.  MANY have it and have talked about it for a <em>long</em> time.</p>

<p>B) It doesn&#39;t matter regardless because real ET disclosure on and around planet Earth won&#39;t be government-based.  TPTB are about <em>controlling</em> disclosure so that the masses either 1) don&#39;t get disclosure at all, or 2) only get certain very limited aspects of it.  As such, government disclosure is something that should be looked upon in a very circumspect manner, and anyone aligned with &quot;government only&quot; disclosure should be considered in the same circumspect manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very human centered argument. You are packing up a lot of assumptions there. </p>

<p>If the operators of the craft are just random explorers exploring the galaxy, then I would tend to agree it&#39;s more likely to find a drone craft, although I would counter that if it&#39;s a drone craft, it&#39;s unlikely we would find even one because there&#39;s probably no good reason to build a large scale drone to visit another planet when one the size of a basketball or maybe even a baseball would do just as well. </p>

<p>However, if they have a reason for being here, there could be very good reasons why they might put the resources into live piloting a craft. For example, their civilization might be millions of years more advanced than ours and visiting another star system might be child&#39;s play for them. Or we might be their experiment that requires hands-on care. Or we (or something on our planet) might be a food source for them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe Greer&#39;s point of view entirely. It&#39;s daft in some cases, I.E. &#39;all the aliens are good&#39;. Good and bad are so subjective here that it&#39;s way too simplistic to make such a statement.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what else you have an issue with, but that&#39;s fine, keep them, they are probably valid in their own right. One thing I&#39;ve noticed about all of these people with sources is at least one aspect of their story is so over the top crazy that it would appear to discredit everything. It&#39;s like 90% truth and 10% fiction and nobody is helping us understand it, in that I agree with Cameron completely, that&#39;s self evident to me.</p>

<p>Whoever manipulated this &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; culture into what it is is masterfully perceptive and intelligent because here we are discussing small beans while the world continues to go nutty. Is it ironic to think it all started with Marvin the Martian cartoon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize that shortly after appearing on JRE (where it was glaringly obvious that Joe hadn&#39;t even looked at the board members of To The Stars - guys like Hal Puthoff, Steve Justice, Christopher Mellon, etc) the New York Times released a front page report on a US Government  UFO research program, complete with official video from a fighter jet&#39;s sensor pod?</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t think you should run out and give him your money, it certainly would be pragmatic to &quot;wait and see&quot; rather than just shit all over the whole thing. For the first time in a generation we have this kind of openness (even if its full of contradictions and many many questions) from the government on the subject. </p>

<p>This ain&#39;t the same as the other UFO messiahs, precisely because we have the internet. </p>

<p>The honest ufological investigators (not the people who try to bend reality to fit their view of it, but those who realize that we know very little) are paying extremely close attention to this.</p>

There is no getting around that. Just because RandomAsshole69 made a video on YouTube about it, doesn’t mean it’s debunked. The data is the data, and that data says these things move like absolutely nothing else we’ve seen on this planet. How much more proof do we need?</p>

What’s he even claiming now that the radar is locking onto, first it was a balloon then a fucking albatross or something. When you take the video, combined with the pilots reactions, and consider it in the context of the Nimitz radar anomalies, the first hand account of experienced fighter pilots and the team of serous IC people coming together on this, West’s “debunking” is just silly. The craft are either extraterrestrial/dimensional in origin, OR they are next gen military tech being flexed by the US a little</p>

If Delonge will one day be proven correct then the same could be said for Greer to a factor of ten.

Perhaps the writers of the Hindu religion deserve credit for their flying palaces known as Vimanas. Either way it’s a alchemical process that should be common knowledge at this point.</p>

<p>Unacknowledged had good intentions and is worth a watch, it was the scene where Greer was describing the end of world hunger through a replicator device he has seen where I felt he was overstepping his mark slightly. The interview testimony section was awesome though especially that British guy who spoke to Prince Phillip about his UFO encounter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought Greer and the disclosure movement were legit as well, but lately I started to see things differently.</p>

<p>Watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM4tkJGSSaU">How to fake an alien invasion by James Corbett</a> </p>

<p>This whole disclosure movement was always and still is financed and pushed by Rothchilds and Rockefellers. It became very obvious to me, that it&#39;s all a psyop and believe me, I &quot;had&quot; EVERY reason to believe Aliens are visiting us. Now I think they aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>The U.S government has all the technology to fake UFO sightings and alien abductions for at least 30 years and that is a fact we have proof for.</p>

<p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48RX6xqKjnU">this</a> for example.</p>

<p>They also have holographic camouflage technology for aircrafts, microwave based voice to skull transmission technology and much more. 
And you can verify this by looking at the officially registered patents you can find on google patents.</p>

<p>Greer is a Fraud backed by the very same people who back Delonge now.</p>

<p>Unsubscribe secureteam10 and sub for Corbettreport and truthstream media :). This is what we are really dealing with.</p>

<p>Not saying there are no Aliens, but that all our evidence for aliens was fabricated by rich men and their toys.</p>

<p>Everything is funded by the rothschilds and the rockerellas. The music industry, the political industry, mass media all of it. It’s not all bad. The gentleman involved with the UFOS is Lawerence Rockerfella who as far as I can make out was a good man.</p>

<p>The idea of a fake alien threat comes from Carol Rosin and her apparent connections to Von Braun (if you don’t know who that is you need to go do some reading) and I believe what it means is there will be no “nuts n bolts” Independence Day style invasion. There is a spiritual component in this phenomena that connects Gods, Ghosts, Bigfoot and the rest of them to this phenomena. Aliens is just what we call them right now from our point of reference.</p>

<p>I am honestly uncertain about the presence of some other intelligent beeings or phenomena on this planet, but I am sure, that most of the evidence we thought we have for this was created by humans on purpose. I know it dude.</p>

<p>I tell you I have frkn scary first hand experiences that would turn anyone into a believer, but I am now sure, that I was tricked by human beings.</p>

<p>Rothchilds, Rockefellers and co. only put on a new face. they suddenly are all for protecting the environment and disclosing things, but that IS all just a lie. </p>

<p>Please watch those two videos when you have some time and maybe look through James Corbetts content a little to find out more about what&#39;s up with the sudden environmentalism of those people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No idea bro.</p>

<p>Things cost money, rooms, food, a stay at a hotel or Inn, staff - people that need to earn a living too - not to mention, whatever money people are talking about, Greer&#39;s documentaries are pretty cheap and are available on things like Netflix - or rented directly from him for 5 dollars or so.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know what double standard people are talking about. We are all in this money world, even if we are not of it - we are all forced to play by the rules so pointing that out as a flaw of character doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to me.</p>

<p>After all, the interviews, the first documentary and perhaps besides some stuff held back, most everything Greer is about is available straight up on youtube for free. I don&#39;t know what else he might have, unedited interviews? Probably worth it, I have no idea, I&#39;ve given his organization about ten dollars total so far, two rented documentaries, one time for each.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I took his phone app(which I managed to get for free, it was free to begin with until they wised up a little because it has some nice stuff in it if you have a high end phone), used it twice for two different CE-5&#39;s. Delonge, Cameron, Jones, NONE OF THEM offer 1.) On the record sources(in some cases enough eye witness evidence to take to court based on precedence) 2.) Something you can personally do to make a difference, in Greer&#39;s world view.</p>

<p>Thus far I haven&#39;t met anybody who trashes Greer who has also watched all the free &#39;eye witness testimony&#39; for the Disclosure Project, not to mention how these people haven&#39;t been prosecuted and why they never will be and also done a CE-5 for themselves. They tend to strike me as very bitter, narrow minded individuals, not all of them, but most - that&#39;s just my experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t a disinfo campaign, its more like a drug addict parent is telling his kid hes going to take some adult candy. The information he is sharing is most certainly not up to date, in fact I am willing to bet that these discoveries and breakthroughs are the very earliest gains in the field. I would like to point out that this guy almost quotes Bob Lazar on the workings of UFOs, a concept he described all the way in the 80s. The description of physics behind UFOs is probably the most understandable concept ive heard of in the past years. All in all, this is the government finally giving away some information on UFOs in regards to ever growing public interest in this area. Not to mention that undocumented budget holes, countless video evidence and numerous eye witness accounts already clearly point to governement involvement, further denial only sows mistrust in our government. They finally saw this and decided to throw us conspiracy &quot;cooks&quot; a bone. As for the possible technical advances made, they woudn&#39;t be released to public knowledge, considering that almost all of this technical data can be used to greatly advance military technology. Handing over these advancements only increases the chances that other foreign states acquire and repurpose this info for military use. It makes me happy that we gained this small victory, but for us believing that we are the only forms of life in the universe to suddeny realizing intelligent life is on our front porch won&#39;t happen overnight. The government is starting to ease us into it by taking small incremental information &quot;disclosures&quot;. This speech was the estalishments way of saying &quot;you&#39;re right, but this information is still too dangerous to fully disclose.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are limits to the plebians knowing things about reality.  Especially when it comes from words and videos which are easily doctorable hollywood style.</p>

<p>What do I know?  Ive read, heard and watched about ETs.  I know of a lot of the lore and ancient teachings about ETs.  Im aware that many of our religious teachings and doctrine may come from them.</p>

<p>None of it is based on concrete reality though.  Its hearsay at this point; easily influenced by the elites.  I think of it like a religion.  Religions have a common root.  These alien stories probably also have a common root.  But surely if it has any truth, its infiltrated by people whose job it is to deceive.  So if the aliens are going to be exposed to the public, theyre going to have to do it thenselves....hard disclosure.  They&#39;d obviously be aware we have problems with violent lying psychopath here on earth and should/would not leave it up to them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wikipedia: Harold E. Puthoff      </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Puthoff took an interest in the Church of Scientology in the late 1960s and reached what was then the top OT VII level by 1971.[3] Puthoff wrote up his &quot;wins&quot; for a Scientology publication, claiming to have achieved &quot;remote viewing&quot; abilities.[4] In 1974, Puthoff also wrote a piece for Scientology&#39;s Celebrity magazine, stating that Scientology had given him &quot;a feeling of absolute fearlessness&quot;. Puthoff severed all connection with Scientology in the late 1970s.</p>

<p>Puthoff directed a CIA/DIA-funded program at SRI International to investigate paranormal abilities, collaborating with Russell Targ in a study of the purported psychic abilities of Uri Geller, Ingo Swann, Pat Price, Joseph McMoneagle and others, as part of the Stargate Project. Both <strong>Puthoff and Targ became convinced Geller and Swann had genuine psychic powers.</strong> However, Geller employed sleight of hand tricks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following all of this, it is exciting and everyone in the world should be paying close attention.  What I am clamoring for is more information about the secret space program.  Once we have disclosure, or at least acknowledgement that there are crafts of unknown origin zipping around the world, the next logical conversation should be.... so what are we going to do about it and how could we protect ourselves if they happen to be hostile.   That is the other side of this coin, this whole process should lead to the discussion that not everything we see in the sky is &quot;theirs&quot;, some of it is ours.  I want to learn more about the tr4b and its  predecessor the tr3b. </p>

<p>What we have to be very aware of, even though the Air force is showing us this  AATIP program and that it exists, they say it was a $22 million program, that is MINUSCULE. The black budget is 59 BILLION per year. If we look at the 22 million vs. 59 billion, that is .004&amp;#37;... yes, less than 1/2 of a tenth of a percent!  Guys, AATIP is a fleck of snow on the tip of the iceberg. I&#39;m not saying that all of the 59B is around the Secret Space Program (SSP), however... the entire yearly NASA budget is a mere 20B!  Is it possible that there is a SSP that is the size of NASA or greater?  YOU BET YOUR BUTT!  </p>

<p>We all know that ET&#39;s exist, what are we doing about it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He actually brought up your concern!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s a fair concern.  This 22 million dollar program was one particular program. That does not say that there were not other programs with other funding levels. It isn’t like, suddenly there was this one program that did not last long and did not have that much money and it shut down.</p>

<p>Interest is continuing. Negotiations are continuing. The programs are being looked at. A lot is going on.  I and my colleagues spend a lot of time in Washington talking to committees that are looking at this from many different angles.  So the general view that, “Oh, it was just one program that came forward and didn’t provide much of value and then it got cancelled . . .”. That’s not really the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with you, this will all lead to the inevitable disclosure that we have a secret space program with a fleet of ManMade UFOs of our own.</p>

<p>Steve Justice the Head of Advanced R&amp;D for Lockheed Martin has agreed to help them build a functioning anti-gravity ship</p>

<p>If some company with under 5 mil in funding is building one of these things you bet your ass the PENTAGON has dozens or even hundreds.</p>

<p>And that brings us to another interesting bit, if they have hundreds of Anti-Gravity ships that can handle space travel,</p>

<p>That means we almost guranteed ALREADY have colonies on the moon and possibly Mars as well.</p>

<p>Who knows how much deeper it goes</p>

The fact that this subreddit is even falling for something like this is really depressing.
The CIA invented the greys, national socialist German scientists created &quot;UFOs&quot; ... For fuck&#39;s sake you think beings from other galaxies and solar sytems would fuck.with us doing circle jerks like crop circles or abductions?
They wouldn&#39;t fucking travel here in a space ship even if they teleported.
At the point a civilization from another galaxy would reach the ability to travel here they would have technology capable of creating new universes and materializing themselves right before every human alive simultaneously.
They could live the life in a full-immersion VR world indefinitely etc etc etc maybe it&#39;s and it and not they and the being is the universe&#39;s overseer why would it dick with us in such a primitive sci-fi fashion.
Take a while to run this through your mind.

Have you spent more than ten minutes &quot;googling&quot; about alien disclosure and the new world order, or project blue beam?

You should know by now this is all part of the &quot;ruling elite&quot; plan to introduce a globalized government.
They&#39;ll either tell us there is an esoteric space based threat, or that they want us to join them under certain conditions or that globalization is the only path of our evolution.
You honestly think the same &quot;cabal&quot; that routinely fuck&#39;s with us, meddles in our democracy and conducts psyop campaigns against the public is going to come out and out of the blue introduce alien disclosure meanwhile their other programs such as q, pedogate, d@q etc etc are playing out?

There have been people working on technology in secret for hundreds of years you don&#39;t think a &quot;top secret&quot; reserch project (s) that have been going on for who knows how long wouldn&#39;t have the means to advance to levels the public would perceive as &quot;sci-fi&quot; given enough funding and &quot;motivation&quot;.?
It&#39;s quaint that people think the &quot;government&quot; is only decades or a hundred years ahead of that they have released to the public.
What you will find out from all of this is that if people weren&#39;t so distracted and preoccupied they could create and achieve things people would think or as fiction or requiring multiple civilizations and millenia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple things.  The magnesium bismuth.  Linda Moulton-Howe got hold of some of that material and had it tested.  Everything above corroborates her independent findings, and then some.  Where she sent it didn&#39;t have the equipment to do the test that would have revealed it to be a waveform guide.</p>

<p>The speed of light as a constant was called into question by NASA (allegedly, behind closed doors) with the Pioneer Anomoly.  It pointed to the speed of light only being constant within a frame of reference.  What I understand that to mean is that the speed of light is the same as far as we&#39;re all concerned on earth, but is different in space, until it encounters another celestial object, then it is a constant in that frame of reference.  It&#39;s also alleged that NASA adjusted for the difference after that but publicly did not reveal it, as it would give our &quot;enemies&quot; a leg up.  </p>

<p>Wish I could find the paper I was reading on it.  I&#39;m not a physicist, but with a little effort, i was able to understand it had something to do with the Lorentz Factor being the correct constant.  Or not.  Whatever it was that general relativity had been based on was not.  I could have it reversed.</p>

<p>Anyway, great job here!  I&#39;m constantly questioning my own understanding and trust in the veracity of footage and testimony.  I would like to think all these witnesses and scientists are earnest, but we&#39;re discussing this under conspiracy because we can&#39;t trust the media, and everyone has an agenda.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen a UFO, an alien, or been abducted.  But I&#39;ve seen enough non-debunked footage to question the true nature of reality.  And I&#39;ve seen too much scoffing by the establishment in the face of impossible artifacts and archeology to put my faith in them either.</p>

<p>Non-conspiracists think it&#39;s easier to believe the establishment narrative.  Occam&#39;s razor seems to make it more and more likely that the fantastic explanation is actually the simplest.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A comment about your speed of light constant.</p>

<p>What came to mind to me (i&#39;m not a scientist) is the temperature at which water boils.  This changes based on atmospheric conditions such as pressure.  Water boils at 212 f in normal atmostphere, under a pressure cooker it boils at 250 f.<br/>
Perhaps these engines produce some kind of condition (atmospheric or whatever) that changes the speed of light constant.<br/>
Maybe they key to its engines is weight and force of gravity on those atoms. Just a though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m staying neutral; we&#39;ll see what comes of it. Putharoff at least seems sincere and legit.</p>

<p>I think our government will never formally disclose aliens, however. I also think the biggest battleground in the fight over alien reality is around DMT experiences. Regular people, including tons of redditors, are having alien encounters every day via DMT. It&#39;s accessible and extremely dramatic, as well as very revealing as to the nature of reality. This is where to look above all, in my opinion, though a strong case around UFO&#39;s is also being made by Richard Dolan and others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been so many false alarms and hoaxes and plain old fantasies about the imminent &quot;disclosure&quot; over the last several decades, that the only thing that would interest me now is the disclosure itself. </p>

<p>There&#39;s only so many times you can have your time wasted on fanciful flim-flam before the attraction wears off.</p>

<p>You know what this stuff reminds me of? Those &quot;End of the World&quot; panics that used to sweep school playgrounds every now and again. When everyone was utterly convinced it would happen, the deadline (nearly always 10 o&#39;clock, in my memory) always passed uneventfully... then a few months later, there would be another one.</p>

<p>(Do those things still happen among today&#39;s kids, btw?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about these guys?  </p>

<p>&gt;Lou Elizondo, who was in fact the Department of Defense’s, the Pentagon’s AATIP program director resigned from the Pentagon and joined us.</p>

<p>&gt;Chris Mellon, 20-year career, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Minority Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, he joined us. We got Jim Semivan, 25-year career and CIA’s Director of Operation. He was the real James Bond kind of guy. Steve Justice just retired as program director for the billion-dollar programs at Lockheed Martin Skunk Works. He joined us.</p>

<p>&gt;And then, I agreed to be on the Board. So, I joined them. In addition to my science and engineering background, I’ve had a lot of activity in classified areas so it was a natural fit for me interacting with all these people.</p>

<p>&gt;We also put together a policy and scientific advisory panel of the best people we could find. Chris Mellon agreed to be the Chair. Dr. Colm Kelleher, he was actually the deputy administrator at Bigelow Aerospace to run the AATIP program out of the Pentagon. Dr. Gary Nolan, top genetics professor at Stanford University. Dr. Kahn, 30 year career with the CIA counter biological weapons program. Dr. Rapp, professor of military and emergency medicine, Uniform Services University. Dr. Gilpin, consultant on academic biomedical research and research law.</p>

<p>&gt;So, we put together a team as panelists to keep us on the straight and narrow of really top people who have wonderful backgrounds and really want to see scientific work be done in this area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I just wouldn’t worship any one. There’s no complete good or evil in this world. Just be like a bee. Look for nectar in everything, take it and move on.</p>

<p>Everything is funded by the rothschilds and the rockerellas. The music industry, the political industry, mass media all of it. It’s not all bad. The gentleman involved with the UFOS is Lawerence Rockerfella who as far as I can make out was a good man.</p>

<p>The idea of a fake alien threat comes from Carol Rosin and her apparent connections to Von Braun (if you don’t know who that is you need to go do some reading) and I believe what it means is there will be no “nuts n bolts” Independence Day style invasion. There is a spiritual component in this phenomena that connects Gods, Ghosts, Bigfoot and the rest of them to this phenomena. Aliens is just what we call them right now from our point of reference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t a disinfo campaign, its more like a drug addict parent is telling his kid hes going to take some adult candy. The information he is sharing is most certainly not up to date, in fact I am willing to bet that these discoveries and breakthroughs are the very earliest gains in the field. I would like to point out that this guy almost quotes Bob Lazar on the workings of UFOs, a concept he described all the way in the 80s. The description of physics behind UFOs is probably the most understandable concept ive heard of in the past years. All in all, this is the government finally giving away some information on UFOs in regards to ever growing public interest in this area. Not to mention that undocumented budget holes, countless video evidence and numerous eye witness accounts already clearly point to governement involvement, further denial only sows mistrust in our government. They finally saw this and decided to throw us conspiracy &quot;cooks&quot; a bone. As for the possible technical advances made, they woudn&#39;t be released to public knowledge, considering that almost all of this technical data can be used to greatly advance military technology. Handing over these advancements only increases the chances that other foreign states acquire and repurpose this info for military use. It makes me happy that we gained this small victory, but for us believing that we are the only forms of life in the universe to suddeny realizing intelligent life is on our front porch won&#39;t happen overnight. The government is starting to ease us into it by taking small incremental information &quot;disclosures&quot;. This speech was the estalishments way of saying &quot;you&#39;re right, but this information is still too dangerous to fully disclose.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t been spending enough time researching conspiracy stuff.
The fact that this subreddit is even falling for something like this is really depressing.
The CIA invented the greys, national socialist German scientists created &quot;UFOs&quot; ... For fuck&#39;s sake you think beings from other galaxies and solar sytems would fuck.with us doing circle jerks like crop circles or abductions?
They wouldn&#39;t fucking travel here in a space ship even if they teleported.
At the point a civilization from another galaxy would reach the ability to travel here they would have technology capable of creating new universes and materializing themselves right before every human alive simultaneously.
They could live the life in a full-immersion VR world indefinitely etc etc etc maybe it&#39;s and it and not they and the being is the universe&#39;s overseer why would it dick with us in such a primitive sci-fi fashion.
Take a while to run this through your mind.
&quot;Aliens&#39; are nonsense and do not exist in the way we have been taught by the establishment&#39;s media.</p>
