    <div class="md"><p>What would possibly convince someone as stubborn as you that these people were killed? If you can find these supposed alive people poised as victims, that would be a start... oh wait, facial recognition, im sure enough people have already used that method and came up empty or it would be all you were talking about. Not to be combative, but is there any chance, in the case where you happen to be wrong, that any sort of information would convince you otherwise? im being hypothetical here, but bare with me, I hate seeing people get their foot stuck in a dead end offshoot of the rabbit hole we all must reach the bottom of together.</p>

Or any other line of proof... but you cannot and will not do this, because like all the above users who have made similar claims, you do not actually know any nonexistent victims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a big one for me too and honestly it didn&#39;t really surprise/excite me at first.  The way it was portrayed is that the military/government have some videos showing UFOs -- which we&#39;ve had similar ones for years already. The media played it off as something that we already knew (and we kind of did) but the government/military disclosing it is a big deal.  I&#39;m just waiting for more disclosure -- will people really ignore it if we end up finding out we&#39;ve had contact with aliens for many years? </p>
