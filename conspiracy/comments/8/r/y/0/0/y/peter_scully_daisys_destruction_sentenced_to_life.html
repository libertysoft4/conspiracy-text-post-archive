<p>You realy still have to think? You&#39;re too good natured.</p>

<p>I read there were three or four men and one or two women also charged.</p>

<p>If you ask me, there should be hell of a research to find everyone else who was connected and also everyone who paid to see those movies and then all of them should be openly executed, slowly. It&#39;d be the only right thing to do.</p>

Someone was talking about all the corruption in the Philippines and so it seems logical that it would be easy to pay a LEO there to kill the guy if its that corrupt. I have no personal knowledge about how corrupt it is or is not there or if it would actually work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t advocate a slow execution. There are some people who shouldn&#39;t be alive, he&#39;s one of them. No need to make it slow though, .50 BMG to the back of the head would suffice.  </p>

<p>The only reason I&#39;m generally against the death penalty is because of how poor government&#39;s track records are when it comes to conviction. I wish there were a way to solidly codify the standard of evidence necessary for a death penalty (undeniable video of the actual crime, overwhelming physical evidence, etc). I don&#39;t know if that will ever happen though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s pleasure in seeing him get executed slowly. It&#39;s the pleasure that he will suffer like he made those little children suffer. Think about it this way - when a dog is sick sometimes it&#39;s recommended that it is put down and doesn&#39;t suffer. The more humane way instead of seeing it with pain.Why would we give Peter Scully that luxury of dying fast in a humane way when he did all those horrible things which to be quite honest I want to vomit right now - its sick.</p>

You know it may make some of these other child rapists think twice before they do something again, or at least not go to some of the deranged levels of the current pedophiles. 
Have the CIA/FBI do it, make them actually do something GOOD once in a while. I hear those guys are some great &quot;information specialists&quot;</p>
