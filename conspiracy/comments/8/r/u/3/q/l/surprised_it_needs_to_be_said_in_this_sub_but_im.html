        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My siblings &amp; i grew up in poverty.  So did my mother.  My fathers family wasnt wealthy but my grandfather became an electrician after WW2 so they were not exactly poor.  College degrees can help get you better jobs than those that dont have them.  But i have met many very financially successful people that dont have them.  Financial success is largely determined by desire, effort, and home much you are willing to risk.  My sister is now a millionaire.  I am not but i’m not in poverty anymore either.  You can be a financially successful drug dealer if you are willing to take the risk - i am happy with what i have with the work i’ve pit in to get here... i am not willing to give up all of my free time as my sister did to obtain her wealth.  Anyone can do it but if you think someone is going to hand you 50K a year just for having a college degree in the field of your study the majority of you will end up greatly disappointed.  This isnt the governments fault either.  You have to fight for whatever it is you want &amp; believe you can do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a programmer. I studied Management Information Systems, which is all about relational databases and how they work. I chose to take some application development classes as my electives and learned a couple programming languages. I put the projects from those classes on my resume and had a really solid interview at my company. I make 60k, and I enjoy what I do wholeheartedly. </p>

<p>All of this after bouncing around from major to major for 3 years. It took a little bit of research. I wanted to know what I was interested in and what I could accomplish within 2 years. I wasn&#39;t going to spend more than 5 years in school. With that criteria, I chose the one that i was most interested and made a lot of money and took it.</p>

<p>Granted, I left with 63,000 in student loans, but after about a year, I&#39;ve paid off 13k of it. I could&#39;ve paid off more, but there were too many impulse purchases. There are high paying jobs out there. You just can&#39;t expect to immediately get them with an art or marketing degree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your degree taught you a valuable skill.  You worked hard to learn the skill.  There are many people that are not willing to put in the effort that is required to learn your skill.  Programming isnt easy &amp; not everyone is gifted with the genetic makeup you have that allowed you to learn how to do it.  If it were easy then everyone would do it &amp; you wouldnt be making as much.  Many are not willing to take on the obstacles you encountered to get where you are.  Congrats!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking about myself when i wrote that.  I went to college initially because i wanted to be a programmer.  I took a full year of C++.  I didnt learn shit from my professors.  I spent that year studying with my peers outside of class.  I would write code &amp; put it through the compiler &amp; it wouldnt do what it was supposed to do.  My peers would look at the code &amp; tell me it should work as they couldnt find any mistakes.  They recommended i go to my professors with it.  I did &amp; the response i got was “i dont know where you’ve made a mistake but if its not working after you put it in the compiler i cant pass your for this”. This didnt happen every time but frequently enough that i gave up on that degree.  It’s my fault i gave up.  I dont make as much as you do now but i’m still ok.  It’s not your fault i make less than you.  You deserve everything you got because you stuck with it.  I dont believe a utopia where we are all making 6 figures is possible.  We would have already made it happen if it was.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but it was a short honeymoon.</p>

<p>Mainly the fact that I was lied to about some training that was required.</p>

<p>Do I regret it? Absolutely, but it has been 21 years (that&#39;s the depressing part, I could have retired this year). But had I stuck with it, I wouldn&#39;t be who I am, made the friends, met the wife and hundreds of other things I have.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned that  I am who I am and I&#39;m not easy to be around sometimes. But I can always make you laugh when you&#39;re down, smile when you&#39;re ready to smack me and I&#39;ll be there when you need me. </p>

<p>I have a lot left in me and a lot left to do with myself.  Follow your dreams when you can, do what makes you happy. And for your sanity, try to live with in your means (I&#39;m working on fixing this part of my life). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve gotten all my rights back except for gun rights.  I&#39;ve gotten bonded etc.  I want to get it expunged but it&#39;s very expensive.  I&#39;ve still got to pay some restitution for what I embezzled etc so it&#39;s not really over I guess.  I was young, good with computers and stupid on consequences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is most definitely a conspiracy by the professors who are there to guide you.  If they dont keep misleading people they dont have their tenure &amp; jobs.  They are doing this out of greed while hurting others.  Someone from scotland said they go to college for free... so why do we have to go imto debt for the same knowledge?</p>
