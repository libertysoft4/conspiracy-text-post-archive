    <div class="md"><p>I suffer from a complete pain in the ass illness called MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity). I can become black hole depressed at the flip of a switch from perfumes, deodorants, shampoos, scented candles, detergents... Depending on the chemical, it can affect me in different ways. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just telling you this because you might want to check your environment for chemical triggers. Even the clothes you wear, or the detergent you use, the antiperspirant, or the shampoo you use to wash you hair with, could be a trigger.</p>

<p>Humans were not designed to live in a synthetic chemical soup. Detergents, fabric softeners and perfumes all affect your brain. I think a lot of people are affected without realizing how much these chemicals can alter your mood.</p>

<p>I hope it helps..not saying this is your cause, but just giving a hint that for some people it could be. I&#39;m pretty sure black hole depression in many cases is in fact brain inflammation, or a symptom of toxic burden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The establishment uses SJWism as a tool for divide and conquer. The elites are extremists. Don&#39;t blame normal Jews who are likely not involved in any way. Powerful zionists are partially to blame and other globalist corporatist parasites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blaming Jews is a divide and conquer tactic as is SJWism. Powerful zionists might be satanists in disguise or something like that (just like I wouldn&#39;t call the peeeedo Vatican &quot;Christian&quot;, it&#39;s probably just a front). </p>

<p>Obviously not all people who identify as Jewish (ethnically or religiously) are involved in globalism and corporatism. Don&#39;t blame the innocent. Instead, go after those with the power and motive to fuck up society for self gain. Unethical oligarchs, regardless of religion or race or whatever. Especially those that bribe our government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, yet the guy above you is right too because while your average Jewish person is probably not involved with any world take over plans or secret cabals, there is a faction that is. It gets complicated throughout history but the people who are at the top of this pyramid are people from that faith who have mixed it with other beliefs to become the nefarious, global slave owners we have now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I wondered this too. I&#39;m not so well researched on Judaism and related stuff but I did read something about Khazaria (canaanites??) converting to Judaism.....perhaps they were satanic first (or whatever it was called back then) and then mixed the religions together. I don&#39;t really know but I&#39;m glad you brought it up because it&#39;s not black and white. </p>

It&#39;s difficult to find truth while trying to weed out any false leads or misinformation, since none of us were alive, we just have to dig further and rely on trustworthy people who want the same truth. I like your style, my friend, we must search for the truth while keeping an open mind. Have a great day! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of the good old days of reddit when we would have open-minded conversations about interesting topics and help each other to find the truth, not attack each other and harass each other for sources and hard evidence for theories we&#39;re entertaining or looking in to.

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like a plan. Also bear in mind reddit is full of bots and shills so it&#39;s especially toxic now (I believe the incessant whining about Trump vs Clinton is mostly a manufactured smokescreen -- I don&#39;t give a shit about either of these Bush/Obama corporatist clones even if Trump was playing 3D chess, which currently I see little evidence for). Money remaining in politics = corrupt business as usual.</p>

<p>To what extent is reddit fake, I cannot tell. But I agree, it costs nothing to be nice and encourage open minded talks. Almost like honest philosophers trying to destroy their own theories until the last one standing might be the right one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t call it liberalism or marxism (these both have several types as far as I know). You probably mean SJWism/extreme political correctness. But even this garbage is not the biggest factor.....our corporatist far right bankster-wallstreet economics is plaguing society with poverty and stress.....far more damage than some dogmatic feminist hypocrites with no power. </p>

<p>If all the feminists and muh &quot;white privilege&quot; hypocrites all changed their ways, would we be happy? The answer is an obvious no. We&#39;d still be controlled by scum corporations who bribe our governments and infect our social programs with profiteering and cronyism. Corporatism is the disease. SJWism is a pest in comparison.</p>

All because of some retard bloodline parasites want to control humanity for some dumbass reason. Imagine all the geniuses that went to waste over thousands of years of oppression (well....I don&#39;t know how consistent the oppression was but you get what I mean, fuck empires). Holy Roman empire only &quot;ended&quot; in 1806 lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A tv in every home and it&#39;s utilized to feed us garbage. It could show us all how to be electricians, physicists and so much more. Instead humanity is forced to serve its lowest common denominator sports, &quot;news&quot; and mind numbing garbage about made up people in made up situations.</p>

<p>This single piece of tech is just one out of millions we don&#39;t use the way we should. We could be so much more... But your wife wants to watch Grey&#39;s anatomy and then watch the Royals get married. And your husband wants to watch a group of men compete against another group of men to put a thing in a thing. Like watching cave men train and hone their aim to kill that mastodon. Its 2018 and we have to entertain the cave people and sell them beer shoes and trucks. They can&#39;t do that simple mental chin up and look at it all from a different view point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with you. Brilliant point about the potential to use TV to teach people how to be electricians, physicists, etc. People being encouraged to do good. None of this unironic edgy &quot;thug life&quot; bullshit in the corrupt music industry. </p>

<p>There could have been whole channels dedicated to training. Even if not literal courses and such, at least honest documentary style education without overdoing the scientist/astronaut celebrity culture, dogmatic scientism religion, half truth/disinfo and watered down crap. </p>

<p>There&#39;s so much filth on TV/movies. Some movies have insane amounts of disturbing gore for no reason, perhaps other than to desensitize society and traumatize it at the same time. Gruesome hyper violence normalizing sociopathic behavior. Just a suspicion of mine, as Hollywood is probably filled with propagandists, disturbed degenerates and satanists. Some TV shows are so mediocre too, you can&#39;t help but watch it as if you&#39;re drugged and the alternative is thinking about work or bills.</p>

<p>I like your attitude, be angry more than depressed. But of course directed towards the elites (rather than how some people foolishly blame people with no power.)</p>

<p>I imagine a world where instead of murders and political two party system horseshit on the news, peoples&#39; creative and intellectual projects are given appreciation and allowed to inspire others. &quot;In other news, a 16 year old has just figured out how to make computers more efficient with this one weird trick!&quot; haha. That would be interesting. I wonder how much damage the invention secrecy act has done in America alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many elitist forces driving the direction of humanity to shit (probably even since ancient Babylonian times). Social engineering, food/medicine/fluoridated water poisoning, corrupt policy makers, propaganda, etc. these all degrade the quality of democratic components of society and degrade intellectual and moral progress. Far better governments have existed and even they weren&#39;t that amazing but excellent compared to the shit we have now. </p>

<p>I try not to be cynical because I&#39;m sure a large fraction of humanity is kind hearted and reasonable as I am. Ignorance can be quashed. Full psychopathy armed with money is a bit harder to stop. A few thousand corporate-banking war lords banding together doesn&#39;t change that imo. Humanity has not remotely reached it&#39;s peak.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yes. But you&#39;re just adding to my point with your statement. You can&#39;t say that because someone does something bad that they&#39;re not part of &quot;humanity&#39;s true something.&quot; It&#39;s all part of the condition, you have to take the good with the bad.

<p>In fact, eastern philosophy would completely reject this notion that they&#39;re somehow divided or distinctly unique things. Yin and yang, can&#39;t have light without darkness, the existence of both are required. It takes both to accurately describe what humanity is.</p>

Such as NEOliberalism/far right libertarian ideology (not the same as moderate right/centrist/center left libertarian -- I do not trust the American Libertarian party, they&#39;re extremists and Gary was pro-TPP.)</p>

<p>Of course extreme collectivism might be something like serving others at the expense of yourself (being a willing slave or something) which even Jesus Christ would probably say is unnecessary. Some sort of balance is divine. The modern U.S. two party system is totally not balanced. It&#39;s a corporatist contest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s the SM virus. Basically stupid people put fake profiles of a wonderful life they don’t have, copy and paste wisdom they don’t have, share opinions they don’t have. And this infects others around them that equally stupidly follow suit. </p>

<p>I was at a party, it was a Halloween party, it was ok but a pretty stated affair, no one too drunk, no one shagging in the toilets, lines of coke were not snorted off anyone’s tits. Yet the next day I saw pics of this party shared on social media. I swear to god it wasn’t the party I went to, people with their tongues out drinks in hand looking like they were partying to the max, only the best costumed people photoed, v signs and, well basically it looked like a fucking good party. However it wasn’t. Yet anyone looking at those pics would wish thy were there and feel they were somehow not enjoying themselves enough, weren’t sexy enough, were getting it wrong. </p>

<p>It’s a false image and I notice it really is the less intelligent that seem to be doing this, so ergo the brighter people are sucked into a stupid world. </p>

<p>And yes it’s all rather depressing. </p>

<p>I suggestively whispered in my friend&#39;s ear and said, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t this be such a great snapchat moment,&quot;</p>

<p>And legit, it looked like he was having an internal battle with himself because he <em>knows</em> my stance on social media, and he <em>knew</em> I was purposely dogging him on. And as soon as I left the room I heard them making a commotion- he was filming my friend faking over what she had just done before (yanking her shirt back by getting it stuck on the kitchen drawer); I went back into the room immediately and the second he saw me he looked embarrassed. In my head I was like... (Really.... you&#39;re so hooked on the attention you&#39;d even take the bait and film this fake moment?)</p>

<p>I can&#39;t wait till my generation looks back at how we were today. It&#39;s going to be so cringey.</p>

<p>Calhoun and his researchers found that in a space-limited/resource  unlimited environment, the population of mice would explode; peak-out  and then collapse to extinction. This test was replicated several times  and it was found that these led to the same outcome each time. The  reason for this phenomenon was found to derived from social decay which  worsened with each generation. The social decay led to unrest in the  environment, which in turn led to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility">sub replacement fertility</a>. It was concluded that nature has a limit in which social animals can interact.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The beautiful ones:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Newer generations born in the now dysfunctional mouse utopia became  withdrawn, spending their days grooming obsessively and dedicating their  time solely to eating , drinking and sleeping. This generation, for all  the emphasis they placed on grooming, would not reproduce. Moreover,  these mice were noted to be unintelligent compared to previous  generations.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“…the limit Calhoun imposed on his population [of mice]  was space — and as the population grew, this became increasingly  problematic. As the pens heaved with animals, one of his assistants  described the rodent utopia as having become hell.”</p>

<p>In my eyes, the most painful part is how blatantly obvious this piece is, its such a powerful cry for help.  There&#39;s a version with music on top saying &quot;are you lost in the world like me?&quot;  How have we gotten to a point in society in which it seems this artist was almost <em>forced</em> to make this work?  In the post WWII era, artists hit a depression due to current events.  Now, we hide behind glitz and glamor all the depression of society.  Only a few voices dare shout into the abyss.</p>

I was chatting to a 14 year old yesterday who was into building Lego. He didn’t have many friends.

<p>It&#39;s all that whole false presentation thing of talking the talk without walking the walk.  Ironic that new Migos song is all about &quot;walk it like I talk it.&quot;  Sure, show me the gold uzis you use to cook up dope that you definitely sell.</p>

The more attractive you are via Photoshop/Facetune, the more subscribers and likes you get, companies start to reach out to you to promote their laxative &quot;weight loss&quot; teas and teeth whitening kits to your followers.

<p>Yeah it’s screwed up. I got used to not getting likes in the mandela effect forum so it did me some good tbh, as I can see how it’s nice to appear to have popular views. But that’s the thing. I can see people posting popular views just to get likes. Which ok maybe that’s meant to show how many people agree, but doesn’t really help us get anywhere, as all everyone is doing is trying to impress people they don’t know. It’s bad enough trying to impress people you do know tbh. </p>

<p>Toxoplasmosis is the only one (100%) of all parasites we know that this description fits on, so I might argue it has a rather special role compared to all the other millions of parasites and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t think that at least naming it in a thread like this here wouldn&#39;t be all too wrong.</p>

<p>There was a study in my country that tested (dead) car drivers who themselfs caused deadly traffic accidents while not being on drugs.</p>

<p>over 90% of all tested people who killed themselfes and others in traffic while not being drunk or on drugs tested positive for Toxoplasmosis.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t proof for anything, but I think it&#39;s save to say, this parasite should be viewed as one special thing and not as (only 1 of millions of parasites) since there aren&#39;t millions of parasites that actually infected 3.5 billion human brains while being known to change behaviour.

<p>Without tech life would be much harder, but it would also be much more rewarding. Imagine being the person responsible for your survival. Hunting and gathering to make sure you have enough to get by. It would be very hard but also very satisfying. </p>

<p>What constitutes a good life varies from person to person. Some people can&#39;t imagine living without our tech, and some live without any tech at all.</p>

<p>Personally I just can&#39;t agree with you tech is very good for us, imagine having a son who gets sick badly, you take him to a doctor who has no idea what&#39;s wrong and gives you some herbs. Or you can go to the doctors we have who will put him in a machine and literally be able to see inside of him.</p>

<p>As with everything there is some tech that isn&#39;t great for us and other tech that is awesome, it&#39;s all down to how we decide to use it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is the argument that humans are natural to planet earth so therefore anything we do is natural, our cities, technology, chemicals, pollution, all part of nature, I don&#39;t buy it.</p>

<p>Have you ever been anywhere where people live a more rural lifestyle? Small farming community&#39;s? Indigenous people&#39;s of various lands? From what I have seen these people seem to be happier overall, almost like their lives are more fulfilled. </p>

<p>Now you add technology and a western lifestyle to the mix and watch what happens. People become lazy, greedy, materialistic, etc very quickly. </p>

<p>I have witnessed this 1st hand in a small farming village in central Thailand over the last 12 years.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say exactly how humans are supposed to be living, but the way we are living just seems off to me like something is missing that we used to have. </p>

Most people in this sub are armchair experts on so many subjects that it&#39;s absurd. Creating a virus to do something like make people depressed just isn&#39;t something you could decide to do.  Especially before the advent of real computer power.  Go look at folding@home they use 100s of thousands of cpus to just run protein folding calculations to find potential cures.  If we could make viruses that do what we want we could make proteins or other molecules for things like cancer and mrsa. </p>

Based on stimuli that would have been an evolutionary advantage to notice. We&#39;ve figured out how to engineer the most intense stimuli for every sense, and we get bombarded from all angles practically all day long. Sure to have some adverse effects... </p>

<p>Modern diets will fatten you up, clog up your arteries and restrict the blood your brain gets.
Pollutants will linger in your body and end up in your brain.
Work tends to mean hours a day on a computer doing something you don&#39;t care about,  <a href="http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/">bullshit jobs</a>.
Modern economies require you move 100/1000&#39;s miles away from your family/community.
You get taught from a young age that empathy is a bad thing and asking why someone is homeless gets the reply of &quot;that&#39;s the way the world is&quot;.</p>

<p>Then you&#39;ve got a media who wants to get everyone to hate everyone else. Vegans? Fuck them. Muslims? Evil, let&#39;s bomb them. Millennials? Boomers? Both evil, hate them. Fat people? Thin people? White? Black? Yanny/loreeal?
We have much more in common that what divides us but you wouldn&#39;t know it if you spoke to most people.</p>

<p>We have huge potential to do great things together and we need to start living now in a way that works 7 generations down the line. Plant trees that&#39;ll we&#39;ll never see fully grown.</p>

Epstein Barr is the herpes virus that causes “mono” ( the kissing disease where you get fevers and feel wiped out for weeks as a young person usually.) Both are largely untreated, undiagnosed, and a bitch to cure. Lysine the amino acid along with elderberry extract can help the Epstein Barr because lysine goes after all forms of herpes. With Lyme, you’re dealing with an ebb and flow of acute infection ( which sometimes presents with fever and a bulls eye rash, but not akways) and chronic infection. Just about everyone, especially in a culture that praises young people having endless partners, friends with benefits, and the hookup culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was just talking to my brother last night about how electronic devices could be causing depression and anxiety amongst humans.  Given humans operate on such a thin spectrum/frequency, an e-device’s RF waves could be interfering with our operating system.  Since the 50s (beginning of our tech boom), depression and anxiety have been on an upswing.  Since the inception of the cell phones, more and more are being surrounded by RF waves and, surely enough, more and more cases of anxiety and depression are being announced.  Just a hypothesis...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be, but I doubt it. People are depressed because they have no real purpose. No real reason to wake up every day. They&#39;re not in enough danger and there&#39;s not enough direct affirmation in their day-to-day activities letting them know they&#39;re doing the correct things to survive. Surviving is too easy. Everything is disposable. We have to create reasons to be upset, to rally around, everything that engages our primal instincts is based on simulation (sports). Look at leftist behavior and ideology and see how... empty it is but how much it is ruling our lives.</p>

<p>People can pretend they&#39;re happy with empty things. But inside, in the quiet, when it&#39;s dark and we&#39;re alone, we can&#39;t hide from the truth anymore. We pretend it&#39;s not lurking around the corner as we drift off to sleep to do it all again tomorrow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ego causes ALL suffering. </p>

<p>You are all born into sin (ego). </p>

<p>That which tempts, that which hijacks control, and that which believes it will die. </p>

<p>The black cube a lot of you speak about is symbolic for “chaos and ignorance”. 
All of you are living within the black cube. Completely unaware of everything around you, including the many energies that can be engaged with.
This is one of the reasons as to why psychological programming exists. Keeping you operating through the ego and not through your true self. </p>

<p>If one operates through their true self (not an archetype) such evil and selfishness would be annihilated. This is where the saying of being away from god is evil comes from. Because it truly is when you have direct experience and not second hand knowledge.
Think of it like being a baby, the baby does not understand hatred or anger, it does understand love though. Your true nature is at its least distorted self when as a baby. The brains filtering processes have yet to develop. </p>

<p>The majority of you will not understand or want to, due to your psychic structures being too solidified and your ego creating many arguments and distortions. </p>

<p>All regions hold part of the truth. All distorted by the ego that desires to protect itself. 
When mentioning religion, I refer more to the essence within all religions and not the uneducated ways of living.</p>

<p>Jesus is on the cross. </p>

<p>Cross = open cube </p>

<p>Jesus on the cross represents ascension to the higher, correction of the human and out of 3D reality. It is wise to keep in mind that all is perception.</p>

<p>You want the world to change? 
Start with yourself. Be honest with yourself and accept that all humans make mistakes and most human beings, including yourself, have been hijacked by an non-real entity. It wants more and more, never satisfied. All propagated and sustained through fear. The use of fear to control the ego is how all of you are kept in check within this declining civilisation. </p>

<p>Who will sacrifice their comfort and lives for a better future? The answer is most of you will not. 
Some of you will say yes but chances are you have just gone into a or several archetypes (normally the Warrior, the One). If you were not controlled by the ego, through fear, you would understand that altruism is the only meaningful thing you could be doing down here. </p>

<p>The seven deadly sins are all born out of the ego. </p>

<p>Anyway, it matters not what those around you say. 
Truth through direct experience is the only way to understand. 
Several ways to get direct experience; </p>

<p>Meditate 
Psychedelic trip (very useful when one needs to -see- the higher process’ or engage with deeper layers of reality) 
Fasting </p>

<p>Try it. 
Don’t come up with an argument, that’s your ego again. </p>

<p>What is the worst thing that could happen meditating in a corner for 10 minutes everyday. </p>

<p>Those here who seek a real spiritual path: don’t talk, don’t get lost within concepts, just do the required work. </p>

<p>If none of you believe this, that’s ok but I’ll leave you with this; </p>

<p>Follow every thought you have backwards. Tell me, where do you find yourself? </p>

<p>A man in a box. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In America, in the 1950’s, a man could work in retail or manufacturing, and earn enough money to afford a small house, car, food, and other essentials so his wife could stay home, and raise their children. The family might go on vacation once a year. The father would come home from work, after an 8-hour shift, and enjoy being with his family, maybe tossing a baseball to his kids, who played outside, until it got dark.</p>

<p>The family would save up for large purchases, such as appliances or a new car. While healthcare wasn’t particularly advanced, most people weren’t concerned about going bankrupt because they were having a baby, needed an appendectomy or medication for a chronic illness.</p>

<p>At one time, General Motors was the largest employer in America, paying in today’s dollars around $50 per hour. Today, the largest employer in America is Wal-Mart, which pays $7-$10 per hour with few benefits.</p>

<p>While Americans have always faced challenges – including in the 50’s – today’s jeopardize the welfare and contentment of great swaths of people who live in poverty (46 million Americans), have severe food insecurities (over 14% of US households), don’t have sufficient housing, and access to healthcare (including care for minor episodes of depression). They live in towns and cities of all sizes, yearning to pull themselves out of their predicaments, but unable to secure higher paying jobs, obtain additional education, afford childcare, pay-down mounting debt, recover from bankruptcies or foreclosures, and pay for necessary medical care.</p>

<p>Hopelessness and depression is a way of life for these people.</p>

<p>Just a step up the economic ladder are people who live paycheck-to-paycheck, one calamity away from losing their home or being contacted by bill collectors. They too experience depression.</p>

<p>People who are on higher rungs, are also wrought with depression, feeling the pressure to work longer hours, be available on weekends and evenings respond to work emails or learn new skills to dodge being laid-off. Maybe they already lost their jobs, and are now working for less money (and few to no benefits) as a contingent or temporary worker. They might have multiple loans to pay for education, health expenses, household and car repairs. Perhaps, they’re paying the mortgage on a house “under water.”    </p>

<p>Adding to peoples’ anxiety is seeing how people with more money and resources live. Dissatisfaction can lead to depression. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think NSC-68 is most to blame for the economic shift we have both long been interested in. Basically, during WWII, FDR was able to control the economy such that millions of women were put into the work force for the first time. At the end of the war, the military-industrial complex feared being surpassed economically by the feminist communists, who put both women and men to work. How could the United States force women to stay in the workforce? The answer was to dilute the currency so that in order to &quot;keep up with the Jones&#39;s&quot; and maintain the same material standard of living, women increasingly had to work outside the home. This was also the origin time of the factory-like schools that prepared workers for big companies with huge armies of employees (the model we still have that is completely failing now). </p>

I like your style, my friend, we must search for the truth while keeping an open mind. Have a great day! </p>
