    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8ml994/reddit_trained_users_to_click_on_ads_right_before/">this really interesting post</a> I saw here a few weeks ago. I was surprised it didn&#39;t really take off much because I had also been noticing way more gilded posts on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> right around the time the redesign was rolled out. I&#39;ve since gone back to the old reddit design so I don&#39;t notice as much, but it definitely seems very intentional with the new layout.</p>

<p>Not long after that was posted, there was a question that hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> from <a href="/r/OutOfTheLoop">/r/OutOfTheLoop</a> asking about all the front page gildings and the official answer was that it was a promotional thing Jeff Goldblum was doing for an AMA or something. Okay, but that still doesn&#39;t explain why there were (and still are) noticeably more front page gilded posts than there were a month or two ago.</p>

<p>That said, in this community in particular, I think so many users here have expressed that they automatically distrust gilded posts that people have started gilding posts as a way to discredit them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you check into my history about this very topic, you&#39;ll find I have been thoroughly been downvoted in the 2 digit range in order to show just how unpopular it is to think such a thing.</p>

<p>Do not consider reddit gold as a bad thing or a way to fuel to the beast.  You should know that as a reddit user in good standing, reddit gold is a thing from heaven and should be regarded as such regardless of your true feelings.</p>

<p>People are so very much attached to this benevolent idea that they&#39;re willing to defend such an idea to the death even though their current reddit skills/experience are still in the 3 month period.</p>

<p>So, consider OP&#39;s topic and ask what the benefit would be or even the message that would prevail.  That message being that reddit, the social manipulation capital of our internet is still manipulating you and at the very least, making money off you doing such things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure, but reddit did go down for about a half hour at 1 PM today. All comments were locked but you could still click on sub Reddit’s and look at the thumbnails for all the posts. But commenting was strictly turned off for literally everything.Anybody got any idea what happened? Lots of big stories coming to light today, especially the broken heart story. Wondering if Reddit conveniently went down because of conversations being had in the comments that might’ve made certain powers that be nervous or what.</p>

<p>reason I said that was because there is a lot of alts on this sub, always has been really for some reason</p>

<p>and then gold was given out throughout the thread during the day while the votecount started rising quite rapidly at some point, felt unorganic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost certain something fishy is going on lately.  </p>

<p>Look at my comment history, I&#39;m politically left leaning but on a thread discussing Hilary Clinton and me talking about how Hilary was heard laughing in a recording, twice, about a sex offender who raped a 12 year old girl. When I talked about this in the comment and called her out all of my comments have been downvoted to oblivion.  </p>

<p>So either:  </p>

<p>A) People on here are really touchy and because I didn&#39;t know how US lawyers worked people have downvoted all my comments which seems very unfair to downvote someone for lacking knowledge of something and openly admitting that.  </p>

<p>B) People on here just presumed I was far-right politically and downvoted me to oblivion which again isn&#39;t the case I&#39;m very liberal and politically left leaning.  </p>

<p>Or  </p>

<p>C) There&#39;s clear manipulation going on and anyone talking bad or negatively about Clinton&#39;s is downvoted to hell and clear vote manipulation is going on.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d actually like to think it&#39;s the latter because if not then we have a very narrow minded and short sited community which normally isn&#39;t the case here.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know but like you said, something doesn&#39;t smell right.</p>

<p>Ding ding ding.</p>

<p>If you really want an accurate taste of this sub try being non partisan.</p>

<p>Whenever I bash trump or the GOP for anything... upvoted. Whenever i do something even as simple as suggest Clinton took lots of corporate money during her campaign... downvote to oblivion.</p>

<p>If you ever try actually pressing people into a discussion, they will respond most with deflections and non sequiturs before finally disappearing from the thread all together.</p>

<p>If you get Reddit enhancement suite you can tag users. Start tagging people with a descriptor about the type of activity you&#39;ve observed from them.</p>

<p>The patterns that emerge will open your eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s always worth looking at a person&#39;s post history...</p>

<p>If the chans are the factory of the Internet (ugly, industrial, raw, but where &quot;Internet culture&quot; gets made), then I suppose Reddit thinks of itself as the shop window.  People come here to buy &quot;products&quot; of information and take them to display in their own Internet houses (Facebook, Instagram etc.).</p>

<p>Control of the narrative matters and the Internet scares the hell out of those that want to shape the product that emerges: it is, at times, chaotic, unpredictable, and even (gasp) occasionally democratic.</p>

<p>Some of the shills on both sides (and bot commanders) are paid, some are zealots, some are misinformed.  But it&#39;s telling how all will try to steer discussion away from critical thinking and civilised debate.</p>

<p>The real generals are not intersted in &quot;red&quot; vs &quot;blue&quot;, of course.  It is about distraction, dilution, confusion and all the usual techniques to prevent people from waking up.</p>

<p>But I suspect most of the users here in this sub, derailed as it has become, know all of this already.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a war going on.</p>
