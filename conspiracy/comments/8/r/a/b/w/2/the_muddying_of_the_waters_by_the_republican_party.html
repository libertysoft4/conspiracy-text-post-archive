<p>We have intelligence agencies confirming this.</p>

<p>We have Trump asking Putin for Hilary emails.</p>

<p>We have a meeting between Trumps son and Russian officials that they lied about.</p>

<p>We have Trump insulting every world leader including allies except for Putin. </p>

<p>Trumps wants Putin back in G7.</p>

<p>Falsely equivicated that were just as bad as Putin in defense of him</p>

<p>Next we have the last three right wing conspiracies.</p>

<p>Obama wiretap, Nunes memo and the current intelligence report. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the difference between these? Russia collusion theory keeps having part confirmed and relevant information added as they investigate. The last three right wing conspiracies have fizzled out in a matter of days due to being smoke and mirrors. Really step back and look at how things play out and recognize what makes a theory credible and what makes a theory just something somebody thought up</p>

<p>You mean the intelligence agencies downplaying everything they did in the report you cite as a dud?</p>

<p>An obvious joke, but what did we learn in the report? What? Foreign powers got access to Hillary&#39;s server!?! I wonder if the Russians have them?</p>
