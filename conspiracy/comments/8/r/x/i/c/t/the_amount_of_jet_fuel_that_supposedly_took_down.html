    <div class="md"><p>For that first part no I dont believe that is how it happened. The weakening of the steel at the top of building lead to a collapse of that section and due to how interdependent structural support this lead to a cascade failure of the entire building. </p>

<p>Uh, considering architects design buildings on the exact opposite premise of your statement, I hope you are wrong and they are right. </p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m being sarcastic. They <strong>are</strong> right and you are <strong>wrong</strong>. The buildings were designed to withstand the impact of an airplane similar to what hit them. And, anyone who says that the designers of those buildings didn&#39;t take into account a fully fueled plane are also wrong. Think about that. Architects designed a building to withstand a jet impact, but never took into account the fuel factor? That is ludicrous at its core. Because architects understand that fuel <strong>is not a factor</strong>. Kerosene! Kerosene,ffs!</p>

<p>No they aren&#39;t. Skyscrapers have massive reinforced steel girders &amp; concrete rebarred reinforcement all through different parts underneath. The floors aren&#39;t going to do any of that pancake bullshit.</p>

<p>This is my point, that it is a misdirect to keep us arguing. I literally stated that I thought it was a controlled demo and have had 56 people message me to argue about jet fuel cant melt steel beams, completely proving my point that it is  to get us to argue instead of just looking to...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re making the same mistake everyone makes with this argument in imagining the towers as one solid rigid structure. None of the building&#39;s lower supports buckeled as the weight felt was more or less the same. The only point where buckeling occurred was where the individual floors attached to the outer walls. The floors themselves were not designed to hold the floors above them but instead transfered their load to the outer walls. This means that if any one floor collapsed then the weight of the collapsed floor could overwhelm the floor below causing a cascading effect. Its a horrible design.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are making the assumption that the color of the smoke says it’s oxygen starved which isn’t true. Kerosene has 8 carbon atoms so when it combusts it actually releases a lot of carbon. </p>

<p>Black fire” is a good phrase to describe smoke that is high-volume, turbulent velocity, ultradense, and black. Black fire is a sure sign of impending autoignition and flashover. In actuality, the phrase “black fire” is accurate-the smoke itself is doing all the destruction that flames would cause-charring, heat damage to steel, content destruction, and victim death. Black fire can reach temperatures of more than 1,000°F!</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt written by a 35 year veteran of the fire service in Colorado. This seems to indicate that a black smoked fire is exactly the type of fire that could weaken steel. </p>

<p>as far as black fire goes, watch the videos of the smoke from the tower its not turbulent or high velocity or really even that dense.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that kerosene needs more oxygen, but that also means it produces more carbon. You are making huge assumptive leaps rather than strictly looking at evidence. Didn’t you just say that black smoke indicates an oxygen deprived fire, yet the video you linked is definitely not an oxygen deprived fire, but the smoke is black. The only explanation is that black smoke MAY NOT indicate oxygen deprivation but could rather be an indicator of a thousand possible scenarios, of which I am only providing one possible one. </p>

<p>You&#39;re missing the point. Soot is literally unburned, flammable hydrocarbons. You can&#39;t have a well-oxygenated fire producing large volumes of black smoke because there would be sufficient oxygen to combust the flammable gases before they condense into soot in the smoke column. This is really basic science. Settled in the 1800&#39;s. </p>

<p>You seem to be suggesting that the black stuff in some kinds of black smoke is not soot. If so, that&#39;s a new one for me. </p>

<p>This is the video link I was given as a response to my black fire comment. The wind driving the smoke shows there is sufficient oxygen coming into that fire yet the smoke is still black. Like I said before, tires when burnt can burn black, a forest fire has the ability to burn black. It’s not a matter of oxygen but rather the fire and fuel itself. </p>

Yes you are correct that there is not enough oxygen to achieve complete combustion, but there rarely ever is enough oxygen for complete combustion.

That is what I mean when I say it wasn’t poorly oxygenated, not that it was combusting completely. </p>

<p>So all the other skyscraper fires that lasted for many more hours &amp; remained intact &amp; even were fixed afterwards......had no office furnishings in them? </p>

<p>Every single one of those fires must have had zero office furnishings because in your theory that was the reason/ cause of all the heat for the WTC towers to come down. Yahhhhhhhh try again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha. I don&#39;t believe for a second that the NIST story is true. A perusal of my comment history would prove that. All I&#39;m doing is trying to clarify some common misconceptions.</p>

<p>The tower fires were fueled by normal office furnishings, and were not well supplied with oxygen. The maximum temperature of an open air hydrocarbon fire is 1800<sup>o</sup> F, and the fires were obviously considerably cooler than that.</p>

<p>Basically the official story requires fires that are hot enough and extensive enough that they could bring most of the thick steel core columns and perimeter columns across an entire floor to their failure temperature at the same time. </p>

<p>No one can really agree on what that temperature actually is because it would depend on the extent of the structural damage from the impact, but I think most people agree that if the remaining intact columns never lost more than half of their strength, then the fires could not have caused the collapse. </p>

<p>Steel loses half its strength at around 1200<sup>0</sup> F, so obviously a 1000<sup>0</sup> F fire could not have done it. In fact not even a 1200<sup>0</sup> F fire could have done it, because a huge steel structure like the WTC towers can sink a lot of heat. In other words, the official story requires an unusually hot fire for which there is zero evidence. </p>

<p>So the heated metal instead of slowly bending because of massive amount of structural resistance underneath it crushed everything underneath it leaving mostly powder?........yahhhhhh bullshit.</p>

<p>I watched it on TV as it was happening on that day. The week before I was watching a documentary of controlled demolitions of old casinos in Vegas. The visual effect of both the towers and casinos were remarkable similar. </p>

<p>Chemical residue tests of the dust and debris of the towers at the site of impact were found to have large quantities of thermite.</p>

<p>Military exercises causing confusion to air traffic control and national security within the same time frame...how does that happen?</p>

<p>Hmmm. Why do little damage to the Pentagon? It was also hit by an aircraft as well. Remarkable that there was no scorched earth from the fuel on the lawn or debris found from an aircraft.</p>

<p>WTF Tower 7!!?? Can anyone explain rationally how it also just mysteriously fell without being touched by any other aircraft yet also fell in the exact same manner... without jet fuel burning. Also, how convenient also with all the evidence and gold housed there as well.</p>

<p>How about that all of that <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.globalresearch.ca/unusual-trading-in-stock-options-prior-to-9-11-government-destroyed-documents-regarding-pre-9-11-put-options/19750/amp">stock activity</a>that took place moments before the incident took place and it seems kinda weird that a lot of stock was bought up in companies that would have profited post disaster while rust was minimized in areas that would suffer.</p>

<p>The aftermath oh 9/11 paved a freeway to the passing of the Patriot Act which prior to faced a lot of opposition. In fact, a lot of new executive orders, FEMA, Department of Homeland Security, etc came out of this </p>

<p>Just saying, but seems like too many coincidences and loose ends with a lot to gain to those who may have had prior knowledge and took advantaged if it.  Is it plausible to theorize that this could have been a false flag in order to gain support for military actions that took place soon after?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It took me a year of looking into conspiracies to realize they were literally built to come down from the very first day they broke ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both technical calculations and testimony from WTC structural engineers confirm that the Twin Towers were built to withstand the impact from the passenger jets that hit them on 9/11.</p>

<p>Airplane impact tests conducted by WTC structural engineers during the design of the Twin Towers used the Boeing 707, which was one of the largest passenger jets in the world at the time. The results of the test, carried out early in 1964, calculated that the towers would handle the impact of a 707 traveling at 600 mph without collapsing.</p>

<p>Even though the two Boeing 767 aircraft that were said to be used in the 9/11 attacks were slightly larger than the 707, technical comparisons show that the 707 has more destructive force at cruising speed. </p>

<p>The maximum takeoff weight for a Boeing 707-320B is 336,000 pounds.
The maximum takeoff weight for a Boeing 767-200ER is 395,000 pounds. </p>

<p>The wingspan of a Boeing 707 is 146 feet.
The wingspan of a Boeing 767 is 156 feet. </p>

<p>The length of a Boeing 707 is 153 feet.
The length of a Boeing 767 is 159 feet. </p>

<p>The Boeing 707 could carry 23,000 gallons of fuel.
The Boeing 767 could carry 23,980 gallons of fuel. </p>

<p>The cruise speed of a Boeing 707 is 607 mph = 890 ft/s,
The cruise speed of a Boeing 767 is 530 mph = 777 ft/s. </p>

<p>So, the Boeing 707 and 767 are very similar aircraft, with the main differences being that the 767 is slightly heavier and the 707 is faster. </p>

<p>In designing the towers to withstand the impact of a Boeing 707, the designers would have assumed that the aircraft was operated normally. So they would have assumed that the aircraft was traveling at its cruise speed (i.e., not at faster speeds perhaps flown by suicide pilots). With this in mind, we can calculate the energy that the plane would impart to the towers in any accidental collision. </p>

<p>The kinetic energy released by the impact of a Boeing 707 at cruise speed is
= 0.5 x 336,000 x (890)<sup>2/32.174</sup> 
= 4.136 billion ft lbs force (5,607,720 Kilojoules). </p>

<p>The kinetic energy released by the impact of a Boeing 767 at cruise speed is
= 0.5 x 395,000 x (777)<sup>2/32.174</sup> 
= 3.706 billion ft lbs force (5,024,650 Kilojoules). </p>

<p>From this, we see that under normal flying conditions, a Boeing 707 would smash into the WTC with about 10 percent more energy than would the slightly heavier Boeing 767. That is, under normal flying conditions, a Boeing 707 would do more damage than a Boeing 767.</p>

<p>So what can be said about the actual impacts? </p>

<p>The speed of impact of AA Flight 11 was 470 mph = 689 ft/s.
The speed of impact of UA Flight 175 was 590 mph = 865 ft/s. </p>

<p>The kinetic energy released by the impact of AA Flight 11 was
= 0.5 x 395,000 x (689)<sup>2/32.174</sup> 
= 2.914 billion ft lbs force (3,950,950 Kilojoules). </p>

<p>This is well within limits that the towers were built to survive. So why did the North tower fall? </p>

<p>The kinetic energy released by the impact of UA Flight 175 was
= 0.5 x 395,000 x (865)<sup>2/32.174</sup> 
= 4.593 billion ft lbs force (6,227,270 Kilojoules). </p>

<p>This is within 10 percent of the energy released by the impact of a Boeing 707 at cruise speed. So, it would be also a surprise for the 767 impact to have caused the South tower to fall.</p>

<p>When interviewed in 1993, Lead WTC Structural Engineer John Skilling told The Seattle Times:</p>

<p>Lead WTC Structural Engineer John Skilling was rightfully confident that neither the impact of a large passenger jet nor the ensuing office fires was capable of bringing down the Twin Towers
“We looked at every possible thing we could think of that could happen to the buildings, even to the extent of an airplane hitting the side… Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed. [But] the building structure would still be there.”</p>

<p>In 2001, Leslie Robertson, a WTC structural engineer who worked as a subordinate to Skilling, claimed that the Twin Towers were only able to withstand the impact of jet airplanes going no faster than 180 mph. However, not only are these statements contradicted by the design test results, they also contradict statements made by Robertson in 1984/1985, when he said that there was “little likelihood of a collapse no matter how the building was attacked.”</p>

<p>Robertson also claimed that the fires caused by a jet impact were not incorporated into the WTC design analysis. “To the best of our knowledge, little was known about the effects of a fire from such an aircraft, and no designs were prepared for that circumstance,” he stated in 2002. However, not only is this statement contradicted by Skilling, but it also lacks common sense, according to 9/11 researcher Kevin Ryan. “That’s kind of crazy… I don’t know how the planes would get to the buildings without jet fuel,” Ryan explains in a video presentation titled The NIST World Trade Center Report: A New Standard for Deception. “Who would design these buildings for jet plane impacts but not fuel fires?”</p>

<p>Not only were the towers designed to survive crashes of large jet aircraft, but they were designed to potentially survive multiple plane crashes. This assertion is supported by Frank A. Demartini, the on-site construction manager for the World Trade Center, who said on January 25, 2001:</p>

<p>“The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it. That was the largest plane at the time. I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door—this intense grid—and the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting. It really does nothing to the screen netting.”</p>

<p>Demartini appeared to be so confident that the towers would not collapse that he stayed behind, after the airplane impacts, to help save at least 50 people. As a result of his actions, he lost his life on 9/11.</p>

<p>Like the firefighters who perished in the WTC buildings, Demartini may very well have risked his life to save others, but the evidence suggests that he did not think he was endangering himself by simply going back into the building.</p>

<p>In addition, investigators from NIST who examined the destruction of the WTC skyscrapers told The New York Times in 2007 that newly disclosed documents from the 1960s show that the new York Port Authority, the original owners of Twin Towers, also considered aircraft moving at 600 mph,slightly faster and therefore more destructive than the ones that did hit the towers.</p>

<p>The information detailed in 9/11: Explosive Evidence – Experts Speak Out demonstrates clearly that pre-planted explosives – not jet plane impacts and fires – destroyed the Twin Towers. The WTC designers seemed to be correct in their analysis in the 1960s, and the evidence that these buildings were brought down by controlled demolition corroborates their conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s definitely interesting, although it seems like the Force 3 explosions may require some containment of the water--otherwise combustible droplets won&#39;t be generated.

    <div class="md"><p>One the things is that the water and molten aluminum would have to be introduced rapidly, and the aluminum would have to somehow trap water underneath--otherwise there would be no buildup of steam to cause the initial explosion. </p>

<p>What&#39;s more the ignition temperature of even extremely finely divided (3-4.5 micron range) aluminum powder is north of 2200 F. For particles 10-14 microns we&#39;re talking about close to 2800 F (&lt;--why does that figure sound so familiar?). </p>

<p>It takes a great deal of effort to divide aluminum that finely and intense heat to ignite it. It would have also made a tremendous flash that surely some camera would have captured. </p>

As a liquid it is much more able to disperse as a fine aerosol, and a thin film of water on a flat surface is the ideal catalyst for the explosion. The aluminium itself is already way above its own ignition temperature point and all it needs is a supply of oxygen to start to burn. The only difference between a burn and an explosion is the time it takes to happen. Blast the aluminium into a fine mist of superheated tiny droplets with steam and it will all burn at once as an explosion.</p>

<p>You can light steel wool with a cigarette lighter. And thermite. Why would an aerosol mist of molten aluminium at 1,000C NOT burn when it gets blasted into a space full of fire and oxygen?</p>

<p>As for there not being a flash.... I can assure you that the smoke in a fire like that is so dense you can&#39;t see your own torch in front of your visor. Anyway.... watch the videos again. You might see something new with what I&#39;ve just told you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant the conditions were nothing liek a smelter.  There may have been pockets that reached 660C, but even that is unlikely, and the likelihood of one of the scattered pieces of aluminum also being in one of those pockets is low.  Then there&#39;s the problem of liquid water making it into one of those hot pockets.

    <div class="md"><p>The conditions were just right for a metal explosion. The combination of materials in an office would burn hot enough to melt aluminium after a while. There were pockets of water for it to flow into. The resulting explosion would be directed horizontally by the reinforced floors and be violent enough to do considerable damage to the weakened uprights. If you don&#39;t accept that all of that is possible it is because you have confirmation bias towards believing the conspiracy, rather than questioning if it&#39;s true.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Again there was a tiny relative amount of fuel that was involved from each plane. They were flying forward at high velocity.</p>

<p>At impact huge fireballs were seen on the opposite side of the buildings impact so much of the fuel was burned off immediately &amp; much plane debris evidently went out the other side of the floors.</p>

<p>SO you are saying the starting with a tiny relative amount of fuel in comparison to the jetliners, much of it has no burned off in first 3 seconds after impact......that the even smaller amount of fuel remaining melted down the jet parts? </p>

<p>Its interesting because I can&#39;t find any scenario online from around the world where jets combusted and melted down. And definitely not twice in the same day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re barking up the wrong tree, there&#39;s nothing unbelievable about an aluminum wing flying at 465mph punching a hole into steel. It doesn&#39;t need to rip right through the I-beam, it only need to rip the I-beam off of the other beams it is connected to.</p>

<p>The real question is how much damage. Enough to bring down a whole damn building symmetrically? Twice? And a third time with building 7?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It cannot even be debated that the bottom undamaged structure could not be pulverized by the damaged structure above it. It is NOT physically possible. It doesn&#39;t mater how fervently someone tries to argue that point. It isn&#39;t possible. At the very most, the top structure with damge support columns should have weakened, due to the heat, to the point that it progressively lost it&#39;s strength, and slowly bent and toppled to one side. It CAN&#39;T go straight down suddenly against the <em>path of GREATEST resistance</em> and destroy the rest of the undamaged structure. This goes against basic physical laws of the universe which are immutable and unchanging. Anyone arguing otherwise get&#39;s a Dunning-Kruger Award.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Floor joists are only designed to hold the weight of that single floor. <a href="http://www.911truth.dk/first/img/wtcExtColumnsLarge.jpg">Look at how flimsy that joist is</a>. When the joists on the upper floor collapsed from a plane having torn through its vertical supports, it fell (along with all of the buring debris and office furnishings) to the floor below, which eventually collapsed under the additional weight. Those two floors fell to the floor below it, which was now carrying 3 times it&#39;s designed weight. When the collapse of one element leads to a chain reaction of failure of all adjacent elements, it is called Progressive Collapse. The phenomenon was not well understood when the WTC was designed, and since 9/11 is now studied by all structural engineers. WTC is a textbook example of Progressive Collapse. In modern buildings we now design &quot;link beams&quot; that are designed to fail, like a fuse, so that a local failure cannot cause a Progressive Collapse that spreads across the link-beam. You are also confusing &quot;bending&quot; and &quot;buckling&quot;. When a vertical column is over-loaded, it will deform (&quot;bend&quot;) only so far before it &quot;buckles&quot;, and collapse in the direction that of it&#39;s load path (for a vertical element this is straight down, into it&#39;s footprint). Think of pinching a toothpick between your fingers... the pick will bend until it snaps. When this happens in a building the columns do not act uniformly together like a solid mass, each column buckles on its own and each one collapses straight down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was looking for this the other day. Some chucklehead was trying to use this as an excuse to explain the collapse.</p>

<p>These same people use the diesel fuel stored at WTC7 despite the fact that the NIST report states that it wasn’t a factor.</p>

<p>Then there’s the excuse that melted aluminum from the plane pooled in the basement and that the explains the molten metal at ground zero.</p>

<p>It doesn’t. That’s why they found molten steel fused with concrete. It was so hot under the pile that it melted steel and concrete together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>kerosene having a lot of carbon means that it draws MORE oxygen to fully burn meaning even less oxygen for the furniture to burn quick or hot if not all of the carbon is pairing with oxygen you get smoke.</p>

<p>as far as black fire goes, watch the videos of the smoke from the tower its not turbulent or high velocity or really even that dense.
this would be the sort of black smoke fire they are talking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWgRAkL3VJM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWgRAkL3VJM</a></p>

<p>Why do people have to invoke things like the &quot;breaking laws of physics&quot; when talking about the malleability of metal. It comes across as uninformed word salad that just discredits your opinion tbh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one serious believes it was a jet fuel fire that brought the buildings down. NIST stated that essentially all the jet fuel was burnt up in the first few minutes. The fires were fueled by regular office furnishings. </p>

<p>And the &quot;black fire&quot; quote is silly. On the one hand well oxygenated fires produce little soot because there&#39;s enough oxygen to combine with the flammable organics to produce invisible CO2 instead of visible soot. </p>

<p>Poorly oxygenated fires produce the same flammable gases as well oxygenated fires, but because there isn&#39;t enough oxygen to burn them, the gases condense into soot particles.</p>

<p>Furthermore 1800<sup>0</sup> F is considered the upper end of open air hydrocarbon fires, so 1000<sup>F</sup> is actually not that hot. I think even AE911 claims the fires were around 900<sup>0</sup> F. </p>
