<p>Haven&#39;t seen anything like this happen in this sub in years so its really activated my amonds. </p>

<p>I was having a civil discourse with the OP because the link he used as his source, did not contain the image used in the OP, and I looked and read it like 5 times.</p>

<p>Anyone know what happened?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Ok now I see it. 16th pick down. Yeah that looks like the artist wearing the headdress, but the Obama one, with the Democrat operative next to him (Chicago jacket) doesn&#39;t look like the artist, does look like Obama, and the guy that&#39;s next to him has a relationship with Obama</p>

<p>the guy in your link, isn&#39;t obama and doesnt look like him.</p>

<p>The post still up on the front page: Does look like Obama, the Vein above the left temple matches the vein Obama has, contextually he&#39;s surrounded by 2 blacks (instead of the white hoards that are at Burning Man), the guy next to him is known in democratic circles and has an actual relationship with Obama</p>

<p>Also have you looked up MissGDesigns?</p>

<p>I can easily find pictures of people who look like this.</p>

<p>Can you explain why the people in both pictures wear the same cape as well? That isn&#39;t sold by Miss D Design.</p>

<p>So, real estate agent and &quot;demonic Obama&quot;:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Same unique headpiece</p></li>
<li><p>Similar skin tone</p></li>
<li><p>Bald</p></li>
<li><p>Black eyebrowns</p></li>
<li><p>Lean</p></li>
<li><p>In his 50s.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Same cape which is not being sold by the artist who made the headpiece.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>But totally not the guy from burning man. All those similarities are all just coincidence, right?</p>

<p>Do you think that Obama somehow got the headpiece and cape from the burning man guy?</p>

<p>Yes. Its certainly a possibility considering the Podesta links to Spirit Cooking Marina Abromvic stuff</p>

<p>Yup, he predicted the Tucson (and Tucson&#39;s Rothchild Mayor) being connected to a kiddie camp back in 2017. Certainly everything should be considered</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;re all creeps.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most posting in this sub hold one of two variants of the <em>manichean battle of good vs evil</em> scenario.</p>

<p>Whereas the truth is that this is just awful people fighting over who gets to be <em>King of the Mountain.</em></p>

<p>They all lie, swindle and kill. They all utilize bribery, blackmail, and game the system wherever possible.</p>

<p>The only real difference is the brand of pandering and outrage one party or the other sells.</p>

<p>So yeah, there is no &quot;4D Chess.&quot; But Trumpsters aren&#39;t alone in being heavily invested in &quot;political religion.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame anyone would imply one need take a side between such cynical political machines.</p>

<p>Definitely.</p>

<p>But without context and proof of Satanic ceremonies using this garb then it would be better proof he&#39;s a drag queen than a Satan worshipper, to me.</p>

<p>Without knowing what it was (leaving aside that it seems proof it isn&#39;t him has been posted and deleted) to just jump to &#39;Satanic Ceremony&#39; serves to reveal how a portion of the people in this sub are stuck in the Satanic Panic of the 80s and will never be free of it.</p>
