Any that did would have only stayed together for a relatively short time before floating apart and or becomeing water logged and sinking. There would have been very limited time to spot anything. It also doesn&#39;t help that there were massive arguments about where to put the most effort into searching so the most crucial window of time was not well used. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the conclusion I came to as well. I remember when 370 first went missing and thought to myself “hmm Malaysian airlines, never heard of it”
Then fast forward to 17 being shot down and thought to myself “okay that seems very strange a second flight from this airlines involved in a major event”</p>

<p>Of course in between I learned of Diego Garcia and the theories surrounding 370 and certainly believe this is the case.</p>

<p>Also, IIRC I remember seeing an article where the bodies of flight 17 were described as being dead before the plane was shot down by eye witnesses</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya I read that about the bodies as well. There was also passports that were in pristine condition found at the scene. Kind of like 9-11. Part of the window configuration at the scene was supposedly from MH370 instead of MH17. I don&#39;t have real proof of any of it just articles I&#39;ve read.

    <div class="md"><p>Good question.</p>

<p>My personal opinion - based on thousands of hours spent attempting diligently to validate official search decisions - is that the official search was not only poorly led (by the SSWG, et al), it was at times built on what we can now prove were lies and deception.  This in turn raises the strong possibility that official search leaders did not WANT the mystery solved.  This in turn implies that the general public (and the families of the missing, and the good folks who risked life and limb searching) could well have been fed a false narrative, to ensure MH370&#39;s true fate remains hidden.</p>

<p>I will hold this view until such time as a) search leaders turn over all models (fuel, ISAT, drift, etc) in sufficient detail to permit independent validation of all search decisions, and b) it is fully explained to the public precisely how a jumbo jet could have made long and deep incursions into the airspaces of India, Indonesia, and Australia, with NONE of their military radar systems doing the job for which they were built.  If the IG&#39;s latest attempt to square the circle is taken as an example, MH370 was within JORN&#39;s range for the hour between when MAS tweeted about the missing plane (MAS public statement issued Mar 7, 23:24 UTC), and when it supposedly crashed into the Southern Indian Ocean (Mar 8, 00:23 UTC, +/-5min or so.  I&#39;m afraid that dog won&#39;t hunt.</p>

<p>(I have c, d, e, f, &amp; g as well, but I won&#39;t bore you with them; nor do they seem necessary, as search leadership seems content to take a big fat zero on a and b.)</p>

<p>I will NOT change this view if seabed wreckage is ever discovered; it is easier to plant fake seabed wreckage than it would have been to plant a fake Inmarsat data log.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try hard not to spend much ink criticizing any of the various unofficial theories out there - primarily because I want to keep people focused on how badly the official theories/searches smell, but also because I don&#39;t like arguing with folks who already agree with me on this key point.  I believe we need to unite on the basics, not fragment over the details.</p>

<p>But since you asked me a direct question, my Canadian heritage compels me to respond politely.  But if it is OK with you, I will comment only on the part of your speculation with which I agree - and leave it at that:</p>

<p>I agree with you that, if the Inmarsat data were authentic, US radar assets in aggregate (OTHR in DG, plus mobile assets in the region) ought reasonably to have been expected to track the flight - yet the US government claims to have had no clue where it went.  To me, this has always represented a monumental gap in the official story. (And that&#39;s before even adding the zeroes taken by Australia, India, and Indonesia.)</p>

<p>And I agree with you that the fates of MH370 and MH17 are very likely related in some fashion.  To me, this is just basic math, because it seems far too improbable as a pure coincidence.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I feel I can safely conclude from the evidence.</p>
