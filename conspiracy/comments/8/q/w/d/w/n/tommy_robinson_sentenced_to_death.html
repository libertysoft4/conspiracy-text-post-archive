<p>The stat and conclusion based on that stat are still completely wrong, and made up. So you are still amplifying lies that are blatant racist propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except the top comment proves you don&#39;t know so much about the situation much either. 71% Muslim being reported in the video vs the actual 14% population. Granted, I am taking the top comment as fact, meaning I haven&#39;t fact checked it, but why inflate the numbers 5x? Not saying the guy isn&#39;t in a risky position, but it appears to paint a false narrative when you have Alex Jones inflating the numbers like that. Also, can he not request protective custody? Asking bc I&#39;m American.</p>
