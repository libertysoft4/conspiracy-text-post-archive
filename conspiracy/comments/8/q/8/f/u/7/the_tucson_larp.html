        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A week ago, this <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8ocpld/breaking_child_sex_trafficking_camp_discovered/">post</a> triggered a flood of similar posts over the next few days making more and more outlandish claims until from one day to another, it went mostly quiet. </p>

<p>You can find most of the posts that were made on the topic <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=tucson&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;include_over_18=on&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;t=all">here</a></p>

<p>Many claims were made, you can read them all in the threads I have linked to. </p>

<p><strong>From the top of my head, those were the more prominent claims. To date not a single one has been supported by evidence and several of them have been debunked:</strong></p>

<p>A rape camp was found</p>

<p>Trees with arm restraints were found (&quot;rape trees&quot;)</p>

<p>500 pairs of children shoes were found</p>

<p>A bloody knife was found</p>

<p>Blueprints were found</p>

<p>A prison was found</p>

<p>Graves were found</p>

<p>Maps were found</p>

<p>Tunnels leading to a casino were found</p>

<p>The camp was made from concrete mixed with childrens&#39; blood</p>

<p>Hillary is involved somehow</p>

<p>A child cadaver was found (bonus: it was found using the blueprints/maps from the rape camp)</p>

<p>The cadaver is of a girl, it was fresh because the brain matter was still &quot;sloshing around&quot;.</p>

<p>The police didn&#39;t show up for days.</p>

<p>There was a shoot-out at the camp</p>

<p>The camp was bulldozed</p>

<p>The camp was burned (bonus: to &quot;destroy evidence&quot;)</p>

<p>Feel free to add more.</p>

<p>Many users who questioned the narrative were ridiculed, insulted and called pedo-supporters.</p>

<p>Threads pushing the narrative received hundreds of upvotes in no time. Threads questioning the narrative received a handful of upvotes at best. </p>

<p><strong>So here&#39;s the conspiracy</strong></p>

<p>This narrative came out of nowhere, exploded across the internet, gained a mass of followers, got spammed for several days up and down this site and then just evaporated.</p>

<p><strong>Was this just simple mass hysteria or was it actively pushed?</strong></p>

<p>If the former, what compels people to be so gullible?</p>

<p>If the latter, by whom and for what purpose? To test how such stories can easily fool people and gain traction?</p>

<p>Hope we can get a fruitful discussion.</p>

I am not posting it for him, and he is not posting this for me.  </p>

<p>I assume we are both aware of the other not being convincable by eachother&#39;s arguments.  </p>

<p>We both are playing to the audience. The casual readers in here only skimming the top comments, maybe doing the occasional dive down a thread until they get bored.<br/>
Would I get down to accusing a shill/troll/whatever (be it true or not), I would alienate the bystander, who is not lurking enough to distinguish us.  </p>

<p>We both try to engage in short sentenced argument snippets. Stuff lying within the attention span of a few moments. If I can&#39;t make sense in a sentence, max two, I loose. If I can make people think &quot;Hey, that sounds more plausible than what the other wrote.&quot; and/or &quot;I chuckled at a humorous remark.&quot;, we might get someone reading more and start thinking for themselves as a far goal.  </p>

<p>No one casually browsing this sub, people who are just visiting, will ever read comments like this one.</p>
