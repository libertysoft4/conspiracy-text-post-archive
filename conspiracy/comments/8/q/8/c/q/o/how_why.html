<p>No, there is not. There have been claims that this is, indeed, possible but they are unproven. This is the fun part about belief. No one can prove it - or disprove it - so it comes down to who/what you believe. </p>

<p>You missed the point. Consciousness isn&#39;t &quot;recycled&quot;. It is always present, but is in a state of inactivity when not part of a human host. In other words when you are born, physically, your consciousness is part of your human host for the whole of your current life. When your human host passes away, your consciousness remains - but with new &quot;data&quot; gained, or lost, depending on what you did while your human host was alive. Think of it as a cosmic Bank account. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do kind of have a &quot;philosophy&quot; that I kind of kick about though, sometimes.  </p>

<p>Our consciousness, such as it exists, whether it&#39;s its own thing or some combination of ethereal and physical attributes, creates its own afterlife, even if it&#39;s just in the last moment before your spark goes black.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re a Lutheran?  Okay, did you live your life according to the rules of Protestantism and on the whole you&#39;re comfortable with your actions?  You get your vision of Heaven.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re Catholic?  You lived your life pretty good, you think, but you don&#39;t know if you make the grade?  Okay, Catholicism allows for that.  You get your glimpse of Purgatory before you go &quot;poof&quot;.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak in detail to the other religions of the world; but whatever your vision of sublimity is based on your beliefs and value system, I think you reach it if YOU feel, measured against yourself and what you &quot;know&quot; to be right and wrong, you&#39;ve done the right things to reach it.  </p>

<p>Is there a Hell here?  I think that people who&#39;ve acted in ways that go against their moral barometer - whatever they&#39;ve been taught as &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;, whatever has entered their subconscious as &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; - will actually measure themselves (based on their perception of a &quot;higher judgement&quot;) and experience &quot;hell&quot; in their final moments before the end of their conscious life.  </p>

<p>Or maybe forever - I&#39;m still a heaven-and-hell believer, myself, I think.  </p>

<p>So... i.e. do serial killers go to hell?  Hmmmm.  Did they act in a way they felt was &quot;right&quot;? Or did they act in a way that deviated from what they knew to be &quot;right&quot;?  Their own consciousness will play the part of the Great Judge upon their death and determine what their final vision will be.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I personally don&#39;t place any stock in a, for lack of a better term, &quot;God&quot; (or &quot;Budda&quot; or &quot;Allah&quot;) simply because this belief system allows people to shift the responsibility for their own actions onto the &quot;God&quot;. Whereas with the Karma system, there is direct responsibility for one&#39;s own actions. Now the results aren&#39;t manifested in our current life, true, and <em>that</em> is where the Karma and God systems converge. The reason for this is simply that human nature doesn&#39;t recognize <em>any</em> belief system at all. It never has and never will. This accounts for your example of a serial killer. He (statistically men) is simply mentally ill, in an <em>extreme</em> way. The problem with a &quot;God&quot; is that the notion is considerably biased. I like to repeat a joke I once heard long ago: &quot;God must be a man, because a women wouldn&#39;t fuck things up this badly&quot; (George Carlin?). Said in humour, but true, I think, just that same...<em>if</em> you believe in God.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But aren&#39;t you making a judgment call there on what &quot;one&#39;s own actions&quot; are (bad or good)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, not at all. I intentionally did not define the actions, simply because I can&#39;t. &quot;One&#39;s own actions&quot; applies differently to each person. I can only judge <em>my actions</em> and mine alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Isn&#39;t that your own personal bias? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, because it applies universally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or are you saying that whatever you do mirrors exactly what will happen to you, in the exact same way? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kind of. Remember that for every action there is a corresponding re-action. This is the basis for the saying &quot;What goes around comes around&quot;. This is true for every belief system equally - and - for the non-believers too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also have problems believing in a karma &quot;bank account&quot; that goes from one life to the next.  Since most of us are blank slates at birth, with no obvious signs of being developmentally &quot;more along&quot; than anyone else at birth or in childhood (with a few very rare exceptions).  </p>

<p>No one has any idea how far along in the &quot;process&quot; they are, it would appear.  Or, in your concept of &quot;karma&quot;, that what&#39;s happening to them now has anything to do with what they&#39;ve supposedly &quot;done&quot; to someone else in a past life.  That hardly seems fair. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consciousness is a freely available shape; it can be reproduced. When you&#39;re no longer conscious, there is a filter process. Filter process is passing through a creative judge who peers into your mental abstraction that concerns all of your years: we&#39;re you to greedy? And ultimately, are you guilty?</p>

<p>Obviously I can&#39;t prove this but, inter alia, given that dreams are true, and lucid dreams too, it shows us that abstractions happen and mind can exist outer body temporarily. Further, it&#39;s unfair, if you can sit around for your life eating animals, while I don&#39;t and put in effort to be different; there is fairness in life well, I believe it.</p>
