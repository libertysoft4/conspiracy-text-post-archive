Supposedly, this same scenario has increased many times in China and of course many other industrial izing nations. It&#39;s not impossible to achieve advanced socioeconomic levels, starting from relatively nothing.

    <div class="md"><p>Just looking at the graph you posted, there was fluctuation in the 1970&#39;s during the period of oil shocks, but the trends really cut away from each other in the early 80&#39;s -- and there was no oil shock then to explain it. </p>

<p>Also, if you look at the wages versus productivity graph, you will see a similar phenomenon -- the separation of the trends in the early 1980&#39;s.</p>

<p>So what happened in the early 1980&#39;s?</p>

<p>Ronald Reagan squeezed the money supply, causing the worst post-war unemployment to this day, gave giant tax cuts to the rich while increasing taxes on most everyone else, expanded deregulated international trade, permitted consolidation of industries and especially the media, and deregulated much else including massive bank deregulation.</p>

<p>There&#39;s your moment of transition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Minimum wage should be keeping up with inflation. It was made to make sure every American had a living wage. There were no issues back in the 70s when a person could work a summer job to pay for college. Buy a house when they got married at 23. And own a car and feed their family and have disposable income.</p>

<p>Buying power has been going down for over a decade with no minimum wage increase. Blaming it on minimum wage is silly.</p>

<p>People making minimum wage spend 100% of their money. Most of it into local economies. Creating more jobs and increasing consumer spending. This is demonstrated like 70 times the minimum wage has increased. Its not minimum wage thats causing the issues </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The horrendous decline caused by privatisation of public services is an issue we are currently facing in the UK. We look across the pond and see what&#39;s happened with capitalism getting its ugly claws into what should be basic civil services, and panic. Our awful conservative government going through our already strained NHS firing half the staff who are already understaffed, then selling the hospitals and trusts off to their friends in the industry for profit. It&#39;s disgusting. </p>

<p>I know the kind of soft-socialism that&#39;s popular in Europe is something abhorred by a lot of Americans, but I am so glad I live in a country (Scotland) where our sub-parliament is resistant to these sorts of things. Our parliament is struggling hard to try to keep public amenities like healthcare, education and such like free at point of use and kept in the public/civil sector. In terms of quality and accessibility this is a much better way, at least as it works here, but while our governments are controlled by money-grabbing, green-eyed monsters, these privileges we enjoy are at risk. On your side of the pond and ours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t necessarily have to increase tuition. Here in Scotland anybody who wants to get a degree and is capable of the entrance requirements can go to university. Higher education is seen as a human right to us, and the government will pay for your tuition fees, and depending on parental income give you a bursary for living costs and stuff on top of that. </p>

<p>For this reason, I can&#39;t understand why even though yes, the huge numbers of graduates and not enough jobs issue is common here too, it could be considered a bad thing. Universal Higher Education is important for a modern, forward-moving society. </p>

If we lived in a true democratic capitalistic state we wouldn&#39;t be taxed, competition would always be in full swing, innovation would always be promoted, but when big banks got involved which our founding fathers were against that&#39;s when it went down hill. Marxism and trickled down capitalism took over.

    <div class="md"><p>Obama came into office. Healthcare costs were going ever high to where people couldn&#39;t afford them and the same was happening with predatory student loans. </p>

<p>Instead of fixing the collusion in healthcare and pharma price gouging problem Obama and his admin basically subsidized the out of control costs through the insurance side. He was effectively trying to decrease bankruptcies and defaults on the over priced bills using tax money.  </p>

<p>Instead of fixing the predatory student loan lending the Obama admin jumped on the band wagon to make a profit too.While at the same time removing regulation, oversight, and  bankruptcy protections.  <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/279512-president-obamas-horrible-terrible-legacy-on-student-loans">http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/279512-president-obamas-horrible-terrible-legacy-on-student-loans</a></p>

<p>Most of the problems mentioned are the direct result of Obama&#39;s policies.</p>
