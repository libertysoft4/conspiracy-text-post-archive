        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Brock Turner did nothing wrong.</p>

<p>He should have just been let free, because no crime was committed.</p>

<p>Look it up.</p>

<p>While drunk, he finger-banged a drunk girl at a drunken college party and then was targeted for cockblocking harassment by a vicious gang of Swedes for partying too hard, the media called it “rape” and demanded he go to prison for the crime of being a heterosexual white male.</p>

<p>The judge actually placated the mob by giving him six months in jail, and ensuring his life was destroyed forever.</p>

<p>But he didn’t go far enough, so now they’re coming for him.</p>

<p>They are trying to push for a recall election – yes, state judges are elected – to get him removed from the judiciary.</p>

<p>LA Times:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judge Aaron Persky says he has no regrets.</p>

<p>The Northern California judge says he would handle the sexual assault case of former Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner the same way today as he did almost two years ago, though it’s the reason he is the target of a June 5 recall election and has become the self-described “most hated man on the internet.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I was this guy I would be like “yeah you know what, I was wrong – I should have dismissed the case and called for the prosecution of the Sweden cockblockers and the lying attention slut along with the journalists who created the insane, anti-white hoax.”</p>

<p>But that’s probably why I’m not this guy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an interview, the 56-year-old Persky argued that the Santa Clara County recall effort was “fundamentally unfair” because it reduces a complicated criminal case to a litany of inflammatory Twitter hashtags. He even got a little teary-eyed as he protested being turned into a one-dimensional caricature of the judge who condones 
rape.</p>

<p>“I expected some negative reaction,” Persky said. “But not this.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Welcome to current year, buddy.</p>

<p>“But not this” is the defining phrase of our era.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The recall effort comes amid the growing influence of the #MeToo movement, and observers say it will serve as a bellwether of the movement’s influence on national politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will definitely show whether or not SJWs on Twitter can have a judge destroyed for refusing to sufficiently lynch a white guy.</p>

<p>Actually, it will only show if they can do that right now.</p>

<p>Because eventually, they obviously will be able to, to the point where no judge anywhere has the balls to question the narrative.</p>

<p>That is exactly what this situation is about – and it is huge.</p>

<p>They are opening Pandora’s Box. Or – perhaps more appropriately – Lemarchand’s 
box.</p>

<p>They are showing that if judges don’t do what the media and their mob of crazies tells them to do, they will be destroyed.</p>

<p>And they’ve already shown, just by bringing this up, that it isn’t worth it for a judge to choose justice over the narrative. Every judge is watching this and thinking “I do not 
want to be this guy.” And in every future ruling they make, they will be thinking that.</p>

<p>We are so fucked. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Persky says he has resisted friends’ calls to quit and relieve the mounting pressure on his wife and two young sons because judicial independence is at stake. Recalling judges over unpopular rulings threatens the integrity of the judiciary, he said.</p>

<p>&quot;To get justice from a judge, they need someone who follows the rules. The basic rule is the rule of law,” he said. “The problem with this recall is it will pressure judges to follow the rule of public opinion as opposed to the rule of law.“</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, no shit.</p>

<p>Like I say: that is the point.</p>

<p>A judiciary with integrity is antithetical to the SJW agenda in America.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On June 2, 2016, Persky followed the county probation department’s recommendation when he sentenced Turner to six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman known in court records as Emily Doe. Turner is also required to register for life as a sex offender.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Allegedly unconscious. </p>

<p>More likely simply drunk.</p>

<p>Or she passed out during the fingering, after they had been making out.</p>

<p>Has anyone speaking on this event ever been to a college party? </p>

<p>Whatever the case:</p>

<p>BROCK TURNER DID NOTHING WRONG.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In court, the victim read an emotional statement recounting the assault, her treatment by investigators and the ordeal of facing questions about her sexual activity and drinking habits. It quickly went viral.</p>

<p>“Instead of taking time to heal, I was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney’s questions that would be invasive, aggressive and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers,” she wrote. “This was a game of strategy, as if I could be tricked out of my own worth.”</p>

<p>drunken college slut</p>

<p>worth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fucking pick one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Persky declined to discuss Doe’s statement or other details of the case because it’s on appeal. Generally, he said, California law requires him to take into account the victim’s statement.</p>

<p>Turner is appealing his jury conviction, arguing he didn’t get a fair trial because character witnesses were barred from testifying about his honesty, scholastic success and his swimming career. Oral arguments are scheduled for June 28 in San Jose.</p>

<p>Persky also declined to elaborate on his reasoning for Turner’s sentence, which was widely criticized as too lenient.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TOO LENIENT!</p>

<p>SIX MONTHS IN JAIL AND A LIFETIME ON A SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY – NEVERMIND HAVING HIS ENTIRE PERSON DESTROYED BY THE MEDIA AND BEING FOREVER LABELED A “RAPIST”!</p>

<p>TOO LENIENT!</p>

<p>Clown world, man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stanford University law professor Michele Dauber is one of the leaders of the recall campaign. Dauber is a friend of the victim’s and was in the courtroom for Turner’s sentencing. She’s an outspoken on-campus activist who has helped push through more stringent sexual harassment and abuse reporting and investigation policies.</p>

<p>Dauber also is an adept Democratic fundraiser who has organized a well-financed recall campaign with glossy mailers juxtaposing photos of Persky with President Trump and Turner’s booking mug shot.</p>

<p>“We feel it’s important to respond strongly with a message of accountability for elected officials like Judge Persky who do not take sex crimes and violence against women seriously,” Dauber said. “Many eyes around the country are going to be on Santa Clara County as a model for how to respond to bias against women in the legal system.“</p>
</blockquote>

<p>YUP.</p>

<p>There you go.</p>

<p>She just outright admits that this is an attempt to bully the entire American court system into pushing a feminist agenda above justice.</p>

<p>She’s also openly called for violence against Turner himself.</p>

<p>This whole situation is absolutely insane.</p>

<pre><code>Welp.
</code></pre>

<p>There goes that.</p>

<p>USA Today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The controversial judge who sparked outrage after offering a lenient sentence to Brock Turner, a former Stanford University swimmer convicted of sexual assault, was recalled from office Wednesday — becoming the first California jurist recalled from the bench in 86 years.</p>

<p>Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky, 56, became the target of a recall after sentencing Turner, who could have faced 14 years in prison, to only six months behind bars.</p>

<p>While the now-famous 2016 sentencing hearing happened before the #MeToo movement took hold over the country, ballots cast Tuesday were made in the backdrop of the movement, which has emboldened sexual assault survivors and forced criminal investigations and oustings of powerful men, most notably with Harvey Weinstein.</p>

<p>Persky’s supporters contend Turner’s sentence was lawful — and the recommended sentence from probation officials. But those calling for the recall say this is just one of many sentences handed down from Persky that were far too light.</p>

<p>Two women are running on the ballot to succeed Persky: civil attorney Angela Storey and prosecutor Cindy Hendrickson.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks, Sweden.</p>

<p>I guess this is why you can’t stop the Moslems gang-raping your own women in your own country – you’re too busy riding around on bicycles in America looking for drunken college students on second base to tattle on.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>I’ve already written enough about what this means.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judge in Brock Turner Case to be Crucified for Not Doing SJWism
Judge in Brock Turner Fingering Case is Facing Recall Vote (He’s Gonna Lose)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tl;dr there is: we’re all fucked.</p>

<p>If judges can be removed from office because they didn’t crucify someone to meet the demands of an SJW mob, it is officially impossible to get justice from an elected judge.</p>

<p>The most basic functions of our most basic social institutions have broken down.</p>

<p>That d-bag who made House of Pederasty recently explained on Twitter that Americans want fascism.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Their agenda is pure power, with no regard for justice, equality or principled government. Their mentality is a ruthless dog-eat-dog, zero sum world in which winners must win at the expense of others, where shame and conscience have no place, and are perceived as weaknesses…</li>
</ol>

<p>— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) June 4, 2018</p>

<ol>
<li>There has been a steady progression from the 2016 election until now of Trump and @GOP leadership preparing their base for the argument that the president is above the law, an argument applicable only to Trump. If Clinton were president it would have been the opposite…</li>
</ol>

<p>— Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) June 4, 2018</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His thing goes on.</p>

<p>It’s a dumb thing, but the basic underlying claim that Americans currently want a strongman to come and take over control of everything is accurate. This is brewing in the collective unconscious of our people. There is an ever-present, driving race consciousness, pushing toward the jihad, and the installation of an emperor.</p>

<p>But this drive does not simply appear out of nowhere.</p>

<p>The drive towards an authoritarian supreme leader is always a collective response to chaos. All of history tells that same story.</p>

<p>And our “democratic institutions” have proved, beyond any doubt, that they are incapable of sustaining order.</p>

<p>We are now on a doom spiral now, with the drivers of this train envisioning some kind of transsexual sharia communism where everything is owned by Jeff Bezos – and the way to get there is to just destroy every last remnant of traditional society.</p>

<p>This is an insane vision, with an insane plan to enact it, and people want a brutal system to reestablish order.</p>

<p>From this, we could create an American fascism.</p>

<p>The conditions exist.</p>

<p>It’s just a matter of whether or not Trump has it in him to seize the throne.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He raped a girl behind a dumpster. Two men saw. The girl was unconscious. That’s rape. Your thoughts on this also make you someone I would advise any man woman or child to be wary of. You can’t do things to people who don’t want those things done to them.  That’s consent. That’s the underlying problem here. That’s why people were upset. He got only a six month sentence because his family was wealthy and connected. You talk about this crime as if it was racial but if he hadn’t been a white Stanford student, he’d still be in jail or more likely dead.
No one is looking for an authoritarian strong man except you either.
