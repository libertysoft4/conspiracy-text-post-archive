    <div class="md"><p>essentially due to the media society has degraded from being to having and then from having to the appearance of having. Images become everything and so if we look at the trump campaign it was a lot of spectacle and the representation of what a strong leader LOOKS like. Trump isnt really a strong leader but he appears to be and that is why he won the election. We use strong images in politics today and that is especially amplified by the internet. Debord who wrote the book experienced this from just TV but it has only gotten worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can use obama as an example too. He was essentially an extension of the bush era of neoliberalism and endless war. But his image was that of change, he represented falsely hope and change. It was the single most successful marketing campaign in US history some argue. This is the point I am making, politics is literally all show it is a giant spectacle more about how you look in the twisted media eye. Trump abused the media 24/7 coverage by essentially getting billions in free ad time by just constantly doing something that would be crazy in normal political discourse.</p>

<p>Uhhh, OP said &quot; I got taken in by his speeches, but his actions say otherwise. He fronts  for criminals. And we’re screwed if REAL American patriots don’t wake  up to this: &quot; which implied that he at one point believed in Trump as a legit president with Americans&#39; best interest at heart. </p>

<p>What I was saying, without saying it, is that presidents have been puppets for a long time, maybe the whole time, so just now waking up to that idea means that the OP has a LOT of research to do, if the idea to pursue the topic is interesting enough to him or her.</p>

<p>This is a conspiracy subreddit. I legit dont understand how you could not comprehend what I was saying...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then say that, don&#39;t belittle OP because they didn&#39;t start learning about this at the <em>exact</em> same moment you did. Maybe OP is 15 years old and just being exposed to this information on this level. Maybe OP grew up indoctrinated into a school of thought that prevented them from seeing these truths. But to sit there with your arrogance and smugness does nothing to help enlighten minds and wake them up and encourage them to do &quot;a LOT of research&quot; as you stated. </p>

<p>Additionally, stating that it has been going on for a long time does what exactly? How does it move the conversation forward? All it is doing is stating the obvious, even for someone just learning this perspective. </p>

<p>So again, I really don&#39;t know what you were hoping to accomplish with your comment, especially after your explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not belittle anyone. I’m not arrogant. I’m not smug. You are making a lot of assumptions because you mistook my comment as being offensive. </p>

<p>Obama made it clear that presidents are puppets. Trump is a damn joke. It’s silly that people believe Trump is working on their behalf. </p>

<p>It’s great that the OP is seeing that everything is an act, a TV show, as fake as wrestling. Now that this idea has come to his mind, hopefully OP and others reading this thread will see my comment and look deeper than just Trump. You think I should write five paragraphs trying to convince anyone to do this? People don’t have the attention span for that anymore. These days it’s gotta be short and sweet or you’ll lose them. But more than that, I used to spend a lot of time and energy trying to shed light on things that would fit right in with the conspiracy subreddit. But most people didn’t care. So now I don’t often take the time to lay out a case to back up my beliefs and statements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think the same thing but if you spent as much time looking at the actual case and the evidence against Trumps crew you would see that there is for sure something fishy going on with Russia there not to mention China.  I feel like Trump made a deal with Russia China Isreal and Saudi Arabia to create a new world order.  I feel like Trump either knows or is being played by all these people and America is gonna get the short end of the stick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People still don&#39;t get the fact Trump becoming president was a kick in the teeth to the US.</p>

<p>In what world would a man with zero political back round and reality show clown not only win the nomination but become president?</p>

<p>You could have put all the faces of congress on the wall and throw a dart at it to get a better candidate.</p>

<p>And then beat Hillary? That whole circus was planned long ago.</p>

The hypocrisy ans arrogance is staggering from pleople with probably little to no experience with politics or the government except they KNOW, how are so many so 100 percent? </p>

<p>He, at least is an insturment of change, I think that is a good thing as the a,ternative to what could be happening if it were not him but hrc. </p>

<p>Lets get rid of the Democratic Party and the Gop, Trump isn&#39;t really a relublican anyway.</p>
