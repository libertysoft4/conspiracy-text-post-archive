    <div class="md"><p>Indeed! Thank you for saying this! Nobody in power has ever lied to anyone. It&#39;s a silly notion, and actually kind of scary to think about - that someone would lie to people or even harm other people to hold onto or gain power! Gosh, that&#39;s just outlandish. I think we should all just spend our lives following the lives of fictional characters that will never really impact the real world or anything - except all of the time we waste inside that fictional world. That&#39;s pretty real but haha way better than this silly notion that people would lie to us to do bad stuff to us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your problem is you believe the mainstream narrative to be the default &quot;truth&quot; position.

<p>It&#39;s possible to get lied to into believing the wrong thing to any side of an issue. I don&#39;t know why you think the more popular or mainstream notion has a monopoly on the truth. </p>

<p>This is true for all narratives.  Narratives propagated on cable news, and newspapers are driven by parameters set by advertisers.  See Herman and Chomsky on this in Manufacturing Consent.    </p>

<p>I am somewhat baffled by your opening post.  If the criteria of what should be pursued is offense by someone connected, than this would inadvertently  entail that most claims could not be made.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey people looking into shady shit our government might be doing, can&#39;t you just watch the distractions on your television like everyone else?&quot;</p>

<p>Sandy Hook is still shady as fuck. I don&#39;t care who&#39;s feelings get hurt by me saying so. And no, I don&#39;t agree with the dumb fucks that attack these people in their personal lives, because that&#39;s fucked up. ESPECIALLY if we&#39;re wrong in all this. That being said, pointing out inconsistencies in the story and analyzing what is told to the public should not be stopped because it might hurt someones feelings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t mean to offend, but this is truly comical. 
How could speculating about a TV show be a better use of time and energy than questioning and researching the real world around you? There is much to gain by controlling what other believe and manipulation of beliefs by those in power are routine and proven to have happened. While none of us will ever know for sure about many of these theories or the extent this is happening, but spending time looking makes you more aware of what is actually happening. I would rather be aware of what’s potentially going on than be blind and manipulated. </p>

<p>Theories, pointing out inconsistencies/lies, and researching truth is not harmful. It may be unpleasant for some to learn they have been mislead or manipulated, but that should not stop the truth from coming to light. There are some outliers who choose to attack people connected to some theories, and that is always wrong and a misuse of time/energy. The focus of the large majority of conspiracy theorists remains on facts and inconsistencies in narrative. It’s wrong to attack someone for any reason, be it based in truth or not. The people doing those type things are wrong and do not represent the whole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Following the news, what the government is doing and information on what is going on around the world does not make anyone less aware. It’s literally looking at the information provided and coming up with your own conclusion, not just believing what the the news says it is, but understanding why that conclusion was reported. If the facts don’t add up, then why they are trying to mislead. </p>

<p>It surely does not make one less aware to do that compared to if they were to only follow Tv shows. If you aren’t interested in what is going on around you, then go ahead and just stick to what you think the writers of West World are going to come up with next. </p>

<p>The conspiracy theorist ends up a conspiracy theorist because they looked at the narrative and saw the flaws, lies, misdirection. They are less inclined to blindly follow some other narrative for that reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tone of your post appears to be condescending and it seems that you are simply trying to antagonize people whom you believe think a certain way, however I&#39;ll bite and take your question at face value and attempt to teach you without mocking you, eventhough it seems you are trying to mock this sub with your post.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories are simply exploring different possibilities. It doesnt necessarily imply that one has to endorse a particular theory or believe it. It is simply analyzing the facts of a given situation and exploring the possibility of conclusions that differ from the official narrative. They arent inherently destructive or harmful, and if you live in a free society, thoughts and discourse of any sort, in and of themselves can never be harmful. That kind of ideology existed in more repressive regimes like the former soviet union. Ultimately what you are suggesting is that certain ideas should not exist because they may potentially offend someone. </p>

<p>Ideas themselves cannot harm anyone. Only actions. Our society is such that we can accommodate all forms of divergent opinion and thought. America has active chapters of the KKK and the communist party and self described satanists, and although I may not agree with what they say it doesnt mean they shouldnt be allowed to exist or discuss their opinions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simply an intellectual exercise. If I lost a child at Sandy Hook, it wouldnt harm me to see others hypothesizing about the potential for possibilities that differ from the official narrative. If I know I buried my child, then I know I&#39;m not a crisis actor. The truth isnt offended by scrutiny.</p>

<p>Even in extreme examples like pizzagate where a young man felt compelled to walk into a pizza shop with an AR-15, ideas themselves didnt harm anyone. It was his actions that harmed and he is paying the consequence for that. But that doesnt mean that we should shut down 4chan because this person may have been influenced by ideas expressed there. If a man stoned his wife for adultery because he read the old testament and felt compelled to take a violent action, should we then ban the old testament? Should we prosecute preachers for spreading the ideas from the bible that may be interpreted a certain way?</p>

<p>Its hard to speak for 650,000 people on this sub, but when you say &quot;you guys&quot; you kind of sarcastically assume that there is a binary A vs B dichotomy. Like all conspiracy theorists think exactly the same. Its much more divergent than that. Different people have different motives for questioning official narratives, and exploring different hypotheses and potential conclusions.</p>

<p>I disagree with your contention that these sort of intellectual exercises are inherently unhealthy. While I have seen people become overly obsessed and attach a certain self importance to their own &quot;wokeness&quot; or knowledge, I have also seen a lot of people who are genuinely searching for the truth and who are comfortable enough with their own beliefs to explore differing possibilities, wherever they may lead.</p>

<p>Again, I cant speak for all 650k members of this sub, but I personally feel exploring things that happen in current events or history from a different perspective and a critical eye is a more productive and healthy use of time then theorizing about fictitious characters or events. There are enough people who follow the kardashians and homeland. I&#39;m sure they derive a certain enjoyment from such pursuits, and if so, more power to them.</p>

<p>I think having the intellectual and moral flexibility to explore different possibilities without becoming offended is actually an enlightening exercise. I think it expands your understanding of human nature and the depths of malfeasance and malice the government and others have the capacity to undertake. Things that most people are unwilling to explore because of their moral dispositions. I think it enhances critical thinking skills and causes you to resist the easier path of accepting things on face value.</p>

<p>I think these are valuable skills and eventhough for some they may lead to a sense of of pessimism or disillusion, others want to have knowledge that is closer to the truth rather than believing a lie just because it may be more pleasant or palatable.</p>

<p>I think its also important to remember that most of these theories are centered around questions that can never be definitively answered with any degree of certainty, which lends itself to hypothesis. If you look at it in this light, theories can never be offensive. They are simply a scientific pursuit. Theories are how science evolves.</p>
