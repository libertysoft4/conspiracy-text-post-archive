    <div class="md"><p>I don’t know why you’re equating what I said to that. That’s a super linear way to think, and by that logic NK already is blowing them off by engaging in peace and economic talks with the US. So I don’t know why you’d say that. </p>

<p>But if you want to think in those terms then yes probably would blow them off if they can be allied with the US along with South Korea japan and a lesser extent Vietnam. As long as the economic incentive is great enough. China’s only ally in the area is North Korea. All those other free nations don’t like them. So I would say it’s not far fetched to see NK flip in there own best interest being backed by the US and basically the rest of the world. In case you haven’t noticed no one likes China. Wether it be the millions of Muslims they’re rounding up in concentration camps, the islands they’re building in the pacific to make military bases, or the lack of reciprocal access to their trade markets China pretty much is the biggest piece of shit world power there is. </p>

<p>That being said, NK selling rare earth elements doesn’t have to mean they’re blowing them off. Simply developing their own industry. </p>
