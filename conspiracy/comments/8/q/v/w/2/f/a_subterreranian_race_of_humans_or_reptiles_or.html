    <div class="md"><p>In the Sumerian creation myth, Enki and Ninmah created humanity to be their slaves after the Igigi rebelled. Another being freed humanity by giving them knowledge in how to save themselves. Maybe that isn&#39;t that far off. In their stories, they have beings who live for half a million years, slowly losing years per generation until they are more human in lifespan. Something about Manna. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the Nephilim are supposed to be the cross breed of humans and Annunaki; it isn&#39;t impossible, admittedly I think the Christ story is another iteration to an older story.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that the Talmud was oral tradition before the exile into Babylon, which would lend the connectedess of the story of Gilgamesh(Deluge/flood story), their creation myth of beings forming them of red clay and the Hebrew creation myth. The laws of Hammurabi and their parallels to the Commandments.</p>

<p>Also worth noting is the Annunaki hierarchical war and it&#39;s similarities to the Bhagivad Gita as well as Proto-Norse mythology. </p>

<p>Being that I believe All the gods of the old pantheons pre-Judaism(or any monotheistic system like what the later egyptian cults would evolve into) were the same beings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lucifer, the lightbearer was likely Prometheus in another story, even talking about giving forbidden knowledge to the simple, servile humans. Satan is probably Enki since Enki wasn&#39;t really kind, destroying the slaves he made because he didn&#39;t like how they revolted to his treatment of them. There are claims by some that the Old Testament God is Enki, given His propensity to smite, also being jealous of affectations toward other &quot;gods&quot;. Nimrod is complicated because there was the place Nimrud and Sargon of Akkad used the named to reference someone. Its useage in the bible refers likely to Sargon, but there isn&#39;t much I can expand upon, and may just have been another name for a king.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  I really appreciate it.  I keep getting conflicting sources.  I will look into Gerald Clark.  </p>

<p>So, Enlil ordered man&#39;s extermination because Enki gave us intellect and we were not supposed to have it.  </p>

<p>Can I ask you one more question?  What about Satan?  I assume that Satan is higher than Lucifer, or maybe Satan is a fiction of the Christian religion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure thing. Yeah, he&#39;s written a few books on the subject and does a list of the bloodlines. </p>

<p>Apparently there were a few versions on man prior to us.  Enlil and others were against the hybrid project from the start and consided it an abomination. He tried a few times to wipe everyone out. So yes, the intelligence given to us was a problem. Good slaves can&#39;t be too smart or too dumb. As someone else said, Enlil was annoyed with humans because they were too loud and that was enough to order the extermination. Then Enki broke command and warned that a boat needed to be built. </p>

<p>As far as Satan goes, I didn&#39;t see him/it mentioned at all and I&#39;ve spent hours and hours on this. The Bible says Satan was simply an opposer or adversary.  I&#39;ve seen Michael Tsarion say that it actually was referring to the planet Mars because there&#39;s a time when Mars appears higher than the sun. The sun is supposed to be the &quot;most high&quot; and this made Mars in opposition to the sun. There&#39;s a Bible passage about standing down or something, can&#39;t remember it. I personally believe that the church conflated the two but I could be wrong. Good luck with your research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. Interesting. Those sites have Anu 60, the father of Enki 40 and Enlil 50, as Yahweh and not as El. (The numbers are their rankings and I have no idea how or why they got those so don&#39;t ask haha) I&#39;m gonna have to look into this. Im definitely not an expert but I don&#39;t see how Anu 60, the highest ranking god, would be listed as Yahweh. Yahweh was associated with a lower ranking volcano god. It doesn&#39;t add up for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not the expert either, so...  </p>

<p>The link I gave you says that Anu/El/Yahweh are one in the same.  Anu is upset that Enki created us humans and taught us the secrets.  </p>

<p>&quot;On the other hand, Anu-Yahweh and his followers, the Anuist Anunnaki, only saw Man as a slave to be exploited and they sought to keep him docile and ignorant. It is for this reason that Anu-Yahweh imposed his policy of obscurantism. The Anuist Anunnaki, staunch conservatives up to the point of stupidity, resented the mixing of divine blood with that of humans and the consequent quantum leap in the evolution of terrestrial Humanity. Therefore, Anu-Yahweh and his &quot;angels&quot;, the malefic invaders whom the Gnostics called &quot;Archons&quot; of the evil Demiurge, seek to destroy our immense ingenuity and ensnare us in their obscurantist and misanthropic religions.</p>

<p>Enki sacrificed everything when he rebelled against the darkness of his &quot;father&quot;. Enki made a huge sacrifice in order to enlighten us and honor his fundamental principles such as love, life and freedom. Enki is a true cosmic hero who couldn&#39;t stand the tyranny of Anu-Yahweh and fought for good.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is very confusing, especially if you are just getting into it. I&#39;m still confused now. I believe the confusion is intentional disinfo after thinking about it. It seems like the Bible conflated both Enki/ Enlil  &amp; Anu /Enlil. I was speaking in general about random sites, don&#39;t think I was trashing your link, it could be correct. </p>

<p>It&#39;s my understanding that at some point Enlil took over as the top ruler, replacing Anu. There&#39;s the back story of the brothers fighting over who will take the top spot and Enki&#39;s jealously that he, the older brother, has to watch Enlil get the throne. </p>

<p>I wonder if the all this confusion is because of that. I do see a few things were Anu being Yahweh would make sense. Example, Anu&#39;s connection with Saturn. The Jewish holy day is Saturnday and their god is currently Yahweh( at least I think) Easy connection.</p>

<p>There&#39;s another strange story of Enlil raping his sister and getting her pregnant (add that to the  multiple genocide attempts and he seems like a really great god for everyone to worship!!) His rank was lowered as punishment until she decided to marry him. After the marriage he regained his rank. Now, in Ezekiel it mentions Yahweh and his 2 wives,  1 of which is his sister. They both cheat on him so he mutilated them, had 1 gang raped then stoned to death. Then he kills their children (Hello Saturn eating his children aka Anu!!) Another connection.</p>

<p>The confusion seems intentional to me. These are major fuck ups between the Sumerian version and the Bible. Again, that&#39;s why I trust Gerald Clark saying Enlil is Yahweh. He put the work in by translating the tablets he had questions with and encourages everyone else to as well.  He is also the only one I&#39;ve seen make a genealogy table to track everyone back to the beginning.  But again do your own research and make your own conclusions. At the end of the day that&#39;s the best we can really do. Good luck, again!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting read on all of this, but one question:</p>

<p>You and <a href="/u/pby1000">/u/pby1000</a> seem to infer that current religions (Judaism, Islam, and Christianity) are false and are for disinfo/confusion -- as far as I can tell, Christianity&#39;s message, in its simplest form, is &quot;Love thy neighbor as thy self and live a selfless life full of love and compassion for others.&quot;</p>

<p>Granted, the cornerstone of Christianity is believing that Christ died for our sins and that God (the Father) resurrected him and if you believe in all of that, you&#39;ll get your pass to heaven. But if the above statement in quotes is true, does it really matter which god was which, who created man and wants us to be slaves, etc.?</p>

<p>If we just have respect for one another, live as relatively selflessly as we can (i.e. I can horde billions of dollars for myself and spend it on 500 exotic cars and mega-mansions <em>or</em> I can keep enough for what I would consider a comfortable lifestyle and then give the rest away to help others less fortunate), does the rest really matter?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>PS - I may not have conveyed my question well enough. If I haven&#39;t, please let me know and I&#39;ll follow-up with a more concise line of thought.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately, I was running around all day and unable to view your link -- but I will definitely be looking at it today.</p>

<p>And as far as religion goes, I can&#39;t say really what I am. I personally view the Bible as a book filled with fantastic stories (worldwide floods, a man walking on water, defying the known laws of physics and creating fish/wine out of nothing, the first known zombie invasion, etc.) but I&#39;ve seen comments all over this sub which state that <em>The Bible is corrupted</em> and <em>The Jews have corrupted Christianity</em>. That may be all well and good for them to state, but I was really wondering <strong>why</strong> they thought that, when the message that I&#39;ve gleaned from the good book is &quot;Love thy neighbor as thy self.&quot;</p>

<p>And yes, regardless of whether or not the Bible is true, it does seem that the atrocities purported committed by the ruling elite are because they believe it will give them power, wealth, or something. So whether or not it&#39;s true, <em>they</em> believe it to be true and believing that continuing to participate in such heinous behavior is the root of their wealth and prestige. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem.  I have been researching the creation stories before the Bible was written.  There is the Nag Hammadi Library and the Sumerian tablets.  It is all very interesting, and the stories parallel those in the Bible, such as Genesis.  </p>

<p>Ok.  The link I provided above gives on explanation regarding the Jewish corruption of Christianity.  I am not saying it is true, though.  </p>

<p>Read about Anu, Enki, and Enlil.  These are the Annunaki.  Anu is the father, and Enki and Enlil are the brothers.  Supposedly, Enki created humans using his own DNA, and Anu disapproved.  Anu created the Jews and other groups to enslave and control Enki&#39;s creation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I didn&#39;t respond. I actually delete all my comments so I forget exactly what I said.</p>

<p>Background: I was raised strictly Christian and I do believe the message of Christ is a beautiful one. After having many doubts about a extremely difficult story to believe I started digging for more answers. I also have no problem at all with people having faith.</p>

<p>With that said, after years of research I believe the 3 religions you mention can be traced back to the pharaoh Akhenaten and his sun good Aton. Akhenaten created to concept of monotheism. He was eventually kicked out of Egypt because of it. Many Alt historians actually believe the Biblical Moses was Akhenaten or perhaps his brother. Freud believed so as well and it may have gotten him murdered for it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if that helps because again I deleted my comment. Get back to me if you have any questions. Peace brother/sister!</p>

The Sumer version of the flood story doesn&#39;t attribute the event to anything, and starts after the flood started, breaks off, and mentions the rewarding of Ziusudra for surviving. The Akkadian version says Enki told Ziusudra to build a boat(Noah&#39;s Ark story) to try to survive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>true. but it does have the added danger of lassoing an asteroid to a very precise orbit, and as someone who watched Boston&#39;s Big Dig (still leaks,) i doubt their abilities, more precisely, their math. </p>

<p>i believe there are people in the earth. whether they are human... eh. idk. having just returned from colorado springs, i lived on top of NORAD for about a month... boom! boom! all day eryday, son. They are building nonstop.. and you see NOTHING. &quot;THEY&quot; could live in the earth, idc what we call them... they would, if they were an intelligent race, for one... i mean, logically speaking, thinking of the earth as an organism, being on the skin is one of the most dangerous places to exist. it is bombarded with toxins, exposed to temperature fluctuation, vulnerable to weather events... inside the organism is where the body chooses to place the heart, and the brain. Hell, intelligent humans and wealthy assholes already have bunkers... and those are just the ones they tell you about. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been interested in subterranean living my whole life. I had thought to hike and find myself spelunking in the world&#39;s deepest tunnels... guess what? at least in the u.s... you can&#39;t. all natural caves are either state owned (rarely,) or surprise, surprise, owned by the national parks. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The fallen angels are stuck down there because they corrupted humanity in its nascent stages</p></li>
<li><p>the reptilian race that coevolved with humans is down there (they went down about 60 million years ago when the dinosaurs became extinct)</p></li>

<li><p>many other groups have places down there</p></li>

<p>They have artificialy sunlight, free energy, a bunch of powerful crystals, and anything you would ever need. Supposedly in some places they use something like holographic projectors so it seems like you are on the surface of the 0lanet when you are down there. There are whole ecosystems of plants and animals down there.</p>

<p>Read about Anu, Enki, and Enlil.  These are the Annunaki.  Anu is the father, and Enki and Enlil are the brothers.  Supposedly, Enki created humans using his own DNA, and Anu disapproved.  Anu created the Jews and other groups to enslave and control Enki&#39;s creation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I didn&#39;t respond. I actually delete all my comments so I forget exactly what I said.</p>

<p>Background: I was raised strictly Christian and I do believe the message of Christ is a beautiful one. After having many doubts about a extremely difficult story to believe I started digging for more answers. I also have no problem at all with people having faith.</p>

<p>With that said, after years of research I believe the 3 religions you mention can be traced back to the pharaoh Akhenaten and his sun good Aton. Akhenaten created to concept of monotheism. He was eventually kicked out of Egypt because of it. Many Alt historians actually believe the Biblical Moses was Akhenaten or perhaps his brother. Freud believed so as well and it may have gotten him murdered for it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if that helps because again I deleted my comment. Get back to me if you have any questions. Peace brother/sister!</p>
