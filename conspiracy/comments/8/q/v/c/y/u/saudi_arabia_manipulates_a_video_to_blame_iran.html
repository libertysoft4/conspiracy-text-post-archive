    <div class="md"><p>The Saudis have been funding terrorism with the British for <a href="http://larouchepub.com/other/2013/4032bust_lond_sar_axis.html">decades</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The wellspring of all significant international terrorism today is the Anglo-Saudi imperial alliance, expressed most vividly in the 1985 Al-Yamamah arrangements between London and Riyadh that persist to this day.</p>

<p>Al-Yamamah (&quot;The Dove&quot;) was ostensibly an arms-for-oil barter deal, first brokered by then-Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin-Sultan, and then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Under the cover of the arms-for-crude-oil deal, over the succeeding 28 years, hundreds of billions of dollars in cash have been squirreled into offshore bank accounts in such notorious havens as the British and Dutch Caribbean Islands, Switzerland, and Dubai.</p>

<p>Those funds have bankrolled nearly 30 years of global terrorism and coups d&#39;état, dating back to late-1970s British and American sponsorship of the Afghan &quot;mujahideen&quot; which spawned al-Qaeda and every other Muslim Brotherhood offshoot now imposing a reign of terror across the entire Islamic world, and into Africa, Europe, and the Americas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beginning in the mid-1980s, Al-Yamamah slush funds bankrolled the &gt;Afghan &quot;resistance,&quot; separatist wars in Africa, and the 1990s conflicts in the Balkans following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. An honest and thorough investigation—yet to be accomplished—would all-but-certainly reveal that Al-Yamamah funds bankrolled the 9/11 terrorists.</p>

<p>Since the article was written, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_28_Pages">28 pages of the 9/11 report</a> have confirmed Saudi financing of the attacks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some leaked information from CIA and FBI documents allege that there is &quot;incontrovertible evidence&quot; that Saudi government officials, including from the Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles, gave the hijackers both financial and logistical aid. Among those named were then-Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar and Osama Bassnan, a Saudi agent, as well as American al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, 9/11 ringleader Mohamed Atta, and Esam Ghazzawi, a Saudi adviser to the nephew of King Fahd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s better to be precise with the wording. The 28 pages have <strong>not</strong> confirmed that any senior Saudi government official knowingly assisted the hijackers with financing or any other help. There are ties here and there, but there is no <strong>public</strong> proof whatsoever showing a Saudi government sanctioned assistance with 9/11. </p>

<p>Saudi <em>individuals</em> probably assisted the hijackers and probably knew the attack would take place, but they call these people &quot;rouge.&quot; The hijackers themselves were also Saudi.</p>

<p>Actual proof is probably in a classified filing cabinet somewhere, to be released in 2044. What probably happened is the Saudis worked with US Intelligence secretly in the attack as a justification for foreign wars and following geopolitical goals, but there&#39;s no &quot;confirmation&quot; in the 28 pages of any help from the Saudi government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 28 pages confirmed the connection to Prince Bandar. Now, Prince Bandar was the ]de facto head of Saudi terrorism operations](<a href="http://larouchepub.com/other/2013/4032bust_lond_sar_axis.html">http://larouchepub.com/other/2013/4032bust_lond_sar_axis.html</a>) for years:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Al-Yamamah (&quot;The Dove&quot;) was ostensibly an arms-for-oil barter deal, first brokered by then-Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin-Sultan, and then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Under the cover of the arms-for-crude-oil deal, over the succeeding 28 years, hundreds of billions of dollars in cash have been squirreled into offshore bank accounts in such notorious havens as the British and Dutch Caribbean Islands, Switzerland, and Dubai...</p>

<p>In 2007, EIR published exclusive evidence about the true nature of the Al-Yamamah-BAE Systems project and the offshore terror funds. Among the evidence presented by EIR was material drawn from a semi-official biography of Prince Bandar, which detailed the offshore sequestration of Al-Yamamah profits and their use to arm the Afghan mujahideen, African governments, and other agencies engaged in &quot;the fight against communism.&quot; Prince Bandar boasted in that book that the Al-Yamamah deal was a product of the unique relationship that existed between the British and Saudi monarchies, which allowed for the build-up of a massive &quot;black fund&quot; with no governmental oversight...</p>

<p>One of the most important British assets in this global genocide scheme is Prince Bandar. Trained in Britain, Bandar was not only the Saudi interlocutor with the British Crown and BAE in forging the original Al Yamamah deal. As Saudi Ambassador in Washington (and as practically an adopted son of George H.W. Bush), Bandar presided over the Saudi intelligence officers who shepherded the 9/11 hijackers for a year, leading up to the September 2001 attacks. His wife, Princess Haifa, provided cover for Bandar&#39;s direct financing of at least one team of the hijackers.</p>

<p>Today, Bandar is in an even more prominent position, as national security advisor to King Abdullah, and as head of the Saudi GID intelligence service. It is Bandar who is behind the deployment of thousands of &quot;dark age&quot; suicide fighters into Syria and Lebanon, to guarantee that the Sunni versus Shi&#39;ite conflict reaches a critical mass of killing and hatred to last a century.</p>

<p>the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia provided material support to al-Qaeda for more than a decade leading up to the September 11th attacks, with knowledge of al-Qaeda’s intent to conduct terrorist attacks against the United States, and an awareness that al-Qaeda would use the support provided by the Kingdom to achieve that objective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Precision is key to maintaining objectivity and respectability. Is there proof that <em>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</em> provided support, or is there evidence that &quot;rouge&quot; Saudi individuals did so without authorization from the SA government? I&#39;m aware that there could have been secret authorization, but if there is no proof, then the &quot;rouge&quot; theory stands. </p>
