    <div class="md"><p>My bad, you&#39;re right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are two profound differences in the chemistry of lunar regolith and soil from terrestrial materials. The first is that the Moon is very dry. As a result, those minerals with water as part of their structure such as clay, mica, and amphiboles are totally absent from the Moon. The second difference is that lunar regolith and crust are chemically reduced, rather than being significantly oxidized like the Earth&#39;s crust. In the case of the regolith, this is due in part to the constant bombardment of the lunar surface with protons (i.e. hydrogen (H) nuclei) from the solar wind. One consequence is that iron on the Moon is found in the metallic 0 and +2 oxidation state, whereas on Earth iron is found primarily in the +2 and +3 oxidation state.</p>

<p>Best case scenario its people who dont know how to use the instrumentation. </p>

<p>Seriously, try to find a write up that would hold up to scrutiny. </p>

<p>I mean like a scientific document laying out the steps and removing potentials for error. Like every other test that is performed. </p>

<p>If anything what you are seeing is this. </p>

<p>I have 2 coolers, one with a lid, one without. </p>

<p>I put a cold drink into both. Which one will warm up quicker? The one that is in the cooler without the lid, right?</p>

<p>So do I proclaim that the lid on the cooler has a cooling effect?</p>

<p>No, thats dumb. There was no lid so heat was able to radiate away more easily. </p>

<p>Same thing here. </p>

<p>What happens on clear nights where the moon is visible? There is no cloud cover AKA no lid on the box. </p>

<p>If there are clouds its like having a lid on a cooler, it doesnt leak heat as easily. </p>

<p>The moon is its own light source, it radiates cold, and it&#39;s an energy transformer.  It&#39;s hollow and you can bounce lasers off of it.  It&#39;s orbit is not dictated by gravity.</p>

<p>Show me a scientific experiment that stands up to scrutiny and disproves what I said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you can use thermometers in the moonlight when it&#39;s full - they will read several degrees cooler.  It&#39;s noticeable - no mainstream scientist can explain this at all.  They always claims it&#39;s space sucking the heat off the planet - which of course is total nonsense.  You can further prove it&#39;s the moonlight that&#39;s cooling by using a magnifying class - it will intensify the effect.</p>

<p>Except it does.</p>

<p>From the above link.</p>

<p>then the answer is one that any amateur astronomer can know.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling</a></p>

<p>The night sky is cold.</p>

<p>Objects exposed to the night sky will radiate their heat into it. Objects exposed to less of the sky (such as under a tree) can &quot;see&quot; less of the sky and will radiate less heat to the sky.</p>

<p>Its the same reason amateur astronomers put tubes in front of their telescopes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/dealing-with-dew/">http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/dealing-with-dew/</a></p>

<p>The anti-dew tubes have no optics and can be made of anything you fancy. They do nothing except stop the lens at the front &quot;seeing&quot; a large part of the sky.</p>

<p>Edit - that article even says &quot;grass in the middle of a field white with frost or dew while grass near a tree has none&quot;. Its exactly the same effect as the &quot;shade&quot; in the youtube video.</p>

<p>Of course you can easily check for yourself that the Moon does no such thing by looking at it with an infrared camera and seeing that it radiates heat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? What were the dozens of times and different conditions you used?</p>

<p>I notice most of the videos which claim that Moonlight has a magical cooling effect cover up one object while leaving the other in open air, and don&#39;t provide a control where they do the same experiment without the moon being out. So I made sure to in my own trials.</p>

<p>In my experiments I noticed that the target exposed to open air was cooler every time, whether the Moon was out or not, whatever its phase, cloudy or not, etc. The results were clearly that something more exposed to the open air was cooler, rather than that the Moon had anything to do with it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to also look at the Moon through an infrared camera. Have you done that? I have although some years ago.</p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a forgery. I think it lacks any sort of control group. As I said is a common mistake above, the maker of this video did not perform a control experiment where they did the same thing but with the Moon not being out. When I did that with the Moon not being out, just the open air, I got the same sort of results.</p>

<p>But I suppose you would think these videos using thermal/infrared cameras are forgeries?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No - I&#39;m sure radiative cooling does apply in many situations.  But moonlight is cooling.  Currently the only explanation given EVER to try explain away this phenomenon is &quot;radiative cooling&quot; - which is all I ever hear, and it does not address why the magnifying glass would further decrease the temperature.</p>

<p>Why do you think the magnifying glass further reduces the temperature?  That&#39;s the heart of the issue.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have my data here - these experiments were generally informal - but the experimental design still works.  If radiative cooling were the only effect in operation, the lenses, as I mentioned before, would INCREASE the temperature.  However, the lenses focusing the moonlight consistently FURTHER DECREASE the temperature.  Why do you think that could be?</p>

<p>Even if you assume this is true, the claimed difference of 2-3 degrees is not nearly enough to account for the difference in temperatures at night, yes? Especially since it is cooler at night even when the Moon isn&#39;t out, I&#39;m sure you agree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said it was a joke as a full explanation of the effect of the experiment - which I control for with the magnifying lens that you did not include.</p>

<p>Then after you goaded me for a while, I clarified my position.  Radiative cooling does exist (I never denied that it did, only objected to your claim that it was reason I was getting a temperature difference) but it does not explain why a magnifying lens further decreases the temperature reads from a thermometer during a full moon.</p>

<p>&quot;You couldn&#39;t even keep your story straight. That&#39;s how I know you&#39;re lying.&quot;</p>

<p>Really though, you were very broad in your claim of calling radiative cooling &quot;a myth.&quot; I am glad you have clarified and/or backed off from that.</p>

<p>So, what do you think of my suggested experiment? Are nights with a full Moon generally cooler than nights with a new Moon?</p>

<p>After all, if the Moon is required to explain the cooling of the Earth at night fully, there should be a significant decrease in nighttime temperature when it is out, right?</p>

<p>What I have read so far suggests either no difference or a minuscule but statistically significant temperature <em>increase</em> with a full Moon.</p>

<p>Can you find any data which suggests that there is a decrease in temperature on nights with a full Moon vs. a new Moon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I wasn&#39;t even aware the term &quot;radiative cooling&quot; applied beyond the topic of the earth cooling at night.  If you look at the wikipedia article on the topic, it&#39;s the only type of radiative cooling all that&#39;s mentioned.  Look.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling</a></p>

<p>Again, you make empty accusation and try to twist my words to discredit me.  It&#39;s pathetic honestly - this is truly narcissistic behavior.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not concerned with trying to broaden this to include speculation and other nonsense.  I posted my experiment - which you have claimed to have imitated (falsely).  Then you have tried repeatedly to twist everything I said in order to attack my credibility when again, I don&#39;t care what you think because I know you&#39;re a liar.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what I am doing. You directly made a claim that that the moon &quot;radiates cold&quot; and cools things down when they are in its light. Should this not apply to the Earth?</p>

<p>I see that you will not provide any data or evidence that there is a decrease in temperature on nights with a full Moon vs. a new Moon.</p>

<p>It is not &quot;speculation&quot; to check the widely available data for temperature over time and compare it against the phases of the moon.</p>

<p>Where did I make this claim?  I believe I&#39;ve only said it&#39;s a property of the moonlight.  I don&#39;t know what the moon is and I am only speaking of moonlight on a full moon - I am not claiming the moon radiates cold.  The cooling doesn&#39;t seem to be present unless the moon is full or near-full.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not asking you to believe me or to look anything up in a journal.  I claim no position of authority, I&#39;m really just saying to any honest readers that you don&#39;t have to believe anything you read on the internet, you can do out and do these tests yourselves for almost no money at all.  The materials are very cheap and the time investment is also minimal.</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re curious, then please try it.  Because as we can all see, <a href="/u/magic_missile">/u/magic_missile</a> certainly did not - he admitted as much when he originally spoke about his experimental design - and I quoted his reply to protect against edits.  Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>You have not proven this claim. I understand that you do not have your own data to share--do you have <em>anyone&#39;s</em>?

    <div class="md"><p>I like to star gaze as well (up to about a 200X magnification). That doesn&#39;t mean I believe what science says is up there. In fact, the more you look up there, the less you believe what school has taught about space.

    <div class="md"><p>Man-made or natural, I don&#39;t believe anything mainstream science says about it: the size, distance, tides, and the way the surface of it was formed. Watching it in a telescope, you&#39;ll see rough crater terrain and then it&#39;s impossibly smooth, making me think it&#39;s all a perfectly smooth surface under an uneven crust. I don&#39;t think the craters are from impacts or volcanic, either. They look more like bubbles popped or something to me. </p>

<p>At any rate, I love Moon-gazing. It&#39;s fascinating to see it up close, and I recommend it to anyone, whether they believe in the lies of mainstream science or seek the truth, it&#39;s still beautiful.</p>

Ancient Aliens did an episode on that, that was actually pretty cool with visual models of what the Moon might look like if it was &quot;extra terrestrial&quot; made. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also trying to catch sight of sun spots with my solar filter and track them throughout the day as they rotate like a wheel. Someday I&#39;ll invest in a nice telescope because it really is amazing to look at that stuff.</p>

<p>In the same way, thermal radiation is a transfer of heat from the object which is radiating. There is no such thing as radiating cold as you have suggested in some of your comments.</p>

<p>As <a href="/u/ima_catholic">/u/ima_catholic</a> suggested, buy an infrared camera and see for yourself that the Moon emits heat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the moon didn&#39;t cool the earth, it would just keep getting warmer and warmer because of the sun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The Earth radiates heat all around it and that is how it cools down. When you shine a bright lamp on something, that thing doesn&#39;t just keep getting hotter forever. It radiates heat to its surroundings, even as they are also radiating heat to it.</p>

<p>The hotter it gets, the more heat it radiates, until it reaches a steady state where it is radiating as much heat out as is being radiated to it. Conduction and convection are involved too in many cases.</p>

<p>If you are interested in this subject, there are free online courses about heat transfer I could point you to.</p>

<p>There is infrared radiation coming from it... infrared radiation heats things up. Radiation in general is a form of energy, and adding energy to a system (by radiation incident upon it) does not cool it down, quite the opposite.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are not claiming &quot;thermoelectric cooling,&quot; you are claiming that it &quot;radiates cold.&quot; That is not the same thing.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Do you understand that as an object such as the Earth heats up, it emits heat as thermal radiation?</p>

<p>When you shine a bright lamp on something, that thing doesn&#39;t just keep getting hotter forever. Do you agree?</p>

<p>It radiates heat to its surroundings, even as they are also radiating heat to it. You don&#39;t need a &quot;cold lamp&quot; to cool it down.</p>

<p>You get that, right?</p>

<p>This is called a deconstructive argument.   You are:</p>

<ol>

<p>I&#39;m not wrong because you are breaking language, and making deconstructive arguments.  That you are resulting to this, likely means that I am right.</p>

<p>&quot;As is typical with popular posts having anything to do with the moon, if you see a removed comment, chances are good it was claiming the moon landing was fake, joking about the moon landing being fake, or some other jokey comment.&quot;</p>

<p>So... If you make a dumb comment, it gets removed. </p>

<p>Easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a theory that getting banned from one subreddit immediately activates the banhammer on other subreddits as well, as The Powers That Be begin to watch your other posts and comments.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, I am now banned from r/AskHistorians</p>

<p>The Crime? Responding to this thread titled  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8qzn8c/why_was_the_emirate_and_late_caliphate_of_cordoba/">Why was the Emirate, and late Caliphate, of Cordoba never able to conquer it&#39;s Christian neighbors in northern Hispania?</a></p>

<p>My response was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They  got infiltrated by Sephardic Jews and Illuminati Superjews (after  marrying supposed Christian women). Having an advanced state wont help if  the castle doors are being opened from within.  </p>

<p>To  give you an idea of how badly the Moors were infiltrated towards the  end, the lions sculpture in the Court of Lions in Alhambra actually  bears a Jewish inscription on the back, complete with symbols, though  they have recently ahem restored it.  </p>

<p>Its called implosion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This comment is now removed...you will however find below it:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And the mods sent me this love letter:</p>

<p><em>You have been banned from participating in</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians"><em>r/AskHistorians</em></a><em>.

<p>I responded matter-of-factly. Normally I use the term [BLEEP] whenever I reference Jews on Reddit, that way fellow goys can still get the hint, but looks like I got lazy here. Going back to the topic, the Moors faced genocide, eviction and forced assimilation because of the treason of [BLEEP]. But we are not allowed to talk about it, even though its all part of the historical record. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m speaking informally on reddit, I&#39;m not trying to publish anything.  As we have discussed, my experimental design meets all the rigors you set out - I have a control and everything.  I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re aware, but you&#39;ve come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to engage with me.  It&#39;s a subreddit - it&#39;s not a science journal - and despite discussing this here, my experimental design was flawless - it met all the criteria you set forth.</p>

<p>Again, your attempts to attack my rigor are very transparent to me - especially because you continue to do it after we have already established my experiment is fine and it&#39;s simply my results that you don&#39;t like.  You clearly want to deny this phenomenon exists because you can&#39;t explain it at all.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not really concerned if you don&#39;t believe my claims.  Thanks again for trying to distract from the fact that you obviously lied about doing experiments.  By your own words you completely omitted the lens component of the experiment, which is critical to proving that it&#39;s a property of the light.  I am now suspicious that you have even performed the version which you initially described.  You seem more like a contrarian trying to win an argument than someone interested in finding the truth.</p>

<p>Generally, I&#39;ve found people that are willing to lie that quickly and easily probably lie all the time :)</p>

<p>Go ahead and keep replying if you want to, I&#39;m done here.  I&#39;ve shown everyone here that you are not to be trusted and will lie to try to prove whatever point you may be arguing.  Have a nice night.</p>

<p>That&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t need it to be <em>your</em> results, I am asking for data collected by <em>anyone</em>. All I have found are youtube videos like you have shared, of a single trial with no control and improvised equipment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No experiment is &quot;flawless,&quot; since all experiments have error which must be accounted for. You have not even described your experiment in enough detail to really make that assessment, anyway. Which is fine with me, as I said, I don&#39;t need it to be <em>your</em> results that prove your claim.</p>

<p>I&#39;m speaking informally on reddit, I&#39;m not trying to publish anything. :)</p>

<p>As I explained, I was describing the conditions under which the experiment was performed. I am happy to discuss more details about <em>how</em> it was done, and the many other experiments I have done, but you seem to have decided to run away from this discussion instead.</p>

<p>I will leave you with the two questions you keep ignoring:</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>You didn&#39;t answer, but do you agree that the Earth cools off at night even when the Moon isn&#39;t out?</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Can you prove the claim that a magnifying glass &quot;further decreases&quot; the temperature? One trial in a youtube video isn&#39;t enough to show this, can you provide any proof of this experiment being done with <strong>repeated trials, control groups, error calculations...? Not necessarily by you, by anyone?</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>You have not proven this claim. I understand that you do not have your own data to share--do you have <em>anyone&#39;s</em>? Or is all the &quot;proof&quot; that exists in youtube videos of one-off measurements with no control groups, no repeated trials, no attempt at measuring experimental error?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The earth is a very complex system where there are multitudinous factors polluting the &quot;global&quot; data so I&#39;m not surprised that temperature data across time does not necessarily readily reveal this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, are you agreeing that nights with a full moon are not as a rule cooler than nights with a new moon? Even though you make the claim that objects under moonlight are cooled down by multiple degrees?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But if you go out near a full moon and focus the moonlight with a magnifying glass, you&#39;ll be able to measure the cooling effects very easily. It&#39;s quite remarkable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My experience contradicts your claim. Since all either of us have are anecdotes, I have asked you several times to link to actual proof of this claim. You have given none.</p>
