<p>I had a post removed because I dared to state</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m having fun. I literally triggered the anti-trump goons to waste time on Justin Trudeau&#39;s fake eyebrows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>here is the link where the mod who removed the post admitted why he removed it</p>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8q1t29/justin_trudeaus_eyebrows_start_to_melt_and_fall/e0g1ugl/">https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8q1t29/justin_trudeaus_eyebrows_start_to_melt_and_fall/e0g1ugl/</a></p>

<p>As you can see in the link, he referenced my comment</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m having fun. I literally triggered the anti-trump goons to waste time on Justin Trudeau&#39;s fake eyebrows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As proof that my entire post is trolling when the comment is in response to a Anti-trump obsessed guy calling me a TD troll.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s just bad lighting. Have fun but don&#39;t be all T_D troll about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is the comment I was replying to, where the user made it about TD trolling and didn&#39;t get their comment removed, warned or anything.  But if I dare respond, they remove my entire post which was currently ranked #1.</p>

<p>A deeper look. Who was the user accusing me of being a TD troll?</p>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Forgelier">https://old.reddit.com/user/Forgelier</a></p>

<p>Go ahead now and scroll through their history, something you think a mod might do before making a decision to remove the #1 ranked post from their sub.  Do you see a pattern?  Oh yes they constantly obsess about The_donald and when they comment in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> its almost exclusively about TD...</p>

<p>Don&#39;t make the progressives angry guys!  they will gang up on you and remove your posts and then frame you as the troll with in reality they have discord chats where they organize this campaign of dominating the /conspiracy subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie didn&#39;t roll over. In the weeks leading up the the Convention there were many reports of his and his inner circles doubts of HRC&#39;s victory. However Bernie, in endorsing her, avoided being able to be &quot;Nader&#39;d&quot; by the Party, though they still try.</p>

<p>Bernie and his inner circle, who all met at Bernie&#39;s house (including Keith Ellison, who was chosen to run against Tom Perez for Party Chair, though this was months before he announced) formed a plan themselves. Afterwards Bernie gave a speech promising that Grassroots organizing efforts and a Think Tank would be founded. And then they <em>were</em>.</p>

<p>In the wake of Bernie&#39;s campaign many organizations, including Our Revolution, have been formed. OR was first headed by Jeff Weaver, Bernies life long friend and former campaign manager, and is now headed by Nina Turner. It has been instrumental in all major Left grassroots victories since the first special elections of 2017. 45% of OR backed candidates have won Primaries and GE&#39;s at all levels from Local to State to Federal against the Party.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Party apparatus has been attacked from the ground floor. The only way we truly take the Dem Party is to storm it from the grassroots. The smallest organizational unit of the Dem Party is the Precinct. Any registered Dem can show up to their Precinct meetings and vote for their Precinct Chair, Precint Chairs vote for County Chairs, who vote for State Chairs, who vote for National Chairs. This is how the People take the Party. And there have been real results. 7 State Parties have been taken from the Corporatists by Progressive grassroots activism, they are: Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts and Missouri. All but the Chair has been taken in Cali, and Cali would have been ours if they hadn&#39;t literally stuffed the ballots against Kimberly Ellis.</p>

<p>Another organization, The Sanders Institute, was founded several months back and includes members such as Harry Belafonte, Tulsi Gabbard, and Nina Turner, among others. This is a think tank dedicated to creating pathways for grassroots Progressive policy goals like those advocated by Bernie in his campaign. It is essentially a brain trust for the movement.</p>

<p>In every one of these endeavors, the Party as fought us every step of the way. The movement is real, and is not a friend of the Party, and neither is Bernie.</p>

<p>There has been another faction at play this whole time. The grassroots Left and Bernie shouldn&#39;t be discounted. I do not regret my vote for Bernie in the Primary, I don&#39;t regret my writing his name in in November, and I won&#39;t regret supporting him when he runs in 2020. </p>
