I was watching geek remix but it&#39;s loading second by second. I&#39;m putting up with it and watching but it literally runs for one second than loads for 15 seconds in an endless cycle. Other videos load just fine. My internet is decent. Geek remix isn&#39;t the only channel it&#39;s happening to but it&#39;s definitely not happening to Markiplier and Game Grumps videos. It&#39;s infuriating and I&#39;m positive that popular videos are on a fast lane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is.  Google has a more or less monopoly on video streaming.  By removing content they don&#39;t like and changing the expectations of users and publishers, the are effectively censoring content.  New video services do not have the same number of eyeballs, so publishers starve.  </p>

<p>The crux of the matter is that Google is going to use their platform (which was historically politically neutral) to push political agendas.  The bait and switch of their policies is the conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They used to do that A LOT back in the day but stopped for a few years. But now it seems they are back at it again, it&#39;s super annoying to listen to rare or independent music uploaded by the composer and having the tracks constantly just fucking stop to show a buffering circle but it never loads more unless you reload the page or put the mobile app out of focus and back into focus.</p>

<p>It also does it in a much more random way than they used to back in the day (2007-2013), usually stopping at the best part or only loading 5-10 seconds at a time before you need to wake it the fuck up again.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be so bad IF it ever actually resumed, but when you get the &quot;small channel coincidence buffering&quot; it always forces you to back out and reopen. It only happens on small channels, and especially with music it seems (basically I listen to remixes of video game tracks, made by a Youtuber with 5000 subscribers, remixing a video game track from a game that&#39;s so rare maybe only a few people even remember the game exists - so definitely SMALL channels with a SMALL niche).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it seems to occur specifically on video game music oriented channels with less than 200K subscribers. It&#39;s so fucking annoying. They used to do it a few years ago as well, but stopped. But looks like they are back at it, coincidentally just happening to buffer &quot;Street Fighter V - Falke Theme&quot; or &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2 - Guy&#39;s Theme (Destructor Remix)&quot; LMAO. Pretty much the definition of small and niche. Bootleg remixes from Youtubers with a low subscriber count, remixing the soundtracks of video games with a small audience of fans.</p>
