    <div class="md"><p>They’re talking about reconciling polarities. Male and female is just a very very easy one for common folk to notice. Think of a yin yang. Male generally represents active force while the female generally represents receptive. If you’re too active or too receptive, you’re going to have a bad time.

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing in flat earth with any merit is that the earth is flat in the viewpoint of light. There’s a million outer space “hoaxes”. Most do not hold water. Can you be more specific? 
Research the Essenes. Research the actual man Yeshua of Nazareth who was dead by the time the first New Testament books were being written (if he ever lived). What did he do for those 30 unaccounted for years? Wouldn’t that be important? Is your Bible even Aramaic? Do you know what the words in the Bible MEAN in their original languages? Do you know what the word Christ actually means and where it comes from? It isn’t a persons last name. 
You just gave me a quote that said we should fear “god”. That’s definitely not the loving god of the New Testament? So what changes? 
The message and the allegory is good but the organization around it has distorted it time and time again. You can’t really trust any Bible you’re reading right now because of how much they’ve been bastardized. You really think LORD was in all caps in the original writing? Maybe that’s the lord you’re supposed to be fearing? Or maybe it’s the lords and Kings of man ie the people with the money who subjugate others. 
Also why do you care if someone wants to be a different gender.? That doesn’t effect you. The fact that the entire Vatican City has tax exempt status though does. The fact that the US government has a black budget that it’s citizens can’t ask about definitely does.
There’s no devil. There’s no evil. Just selfish assholes and the selfish assholes who let them get away with it. The world is a lot sillier and simpler than we’d like to think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Outer space&quot; literally does not exist.  The entire thing is a hoax.  So is the &quot;spinning ball&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otQt8AEZ1PI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otQt8AEZ1PI</a></p>

<p>Who knows what hsitory is fabricated.  Most mainstream history is tainted/fake.  So is alternative history.  The only truth you can have is within the King James Bible.</p>

<p>Christ is similar to anointed.  He is the Christ, it&#39;s not his last name.</p>

<p>God has both perfect love and perfect wrath.  It&#39;s the same God.  He showed his love for us by dying for us.  He will show his wrath in the future to those that reject his atonement.</p>

<p>Pro 1:22  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 
Pro 1:23  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. 
Pro 1:24  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; 
Pro 1:25  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: 
Pro 1:26  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 
Pro 1:27  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. 
Pro 1:28  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: 
Pro 1:29  For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 
Pro 1:30  They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. 
Pro 1:31  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. 
Pro 1:32  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. 
Pro 1:33  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. </p>

<p>The big mistake we make is thinking we are better than anyone else.  We compare ourselves to other humans and then judge ourselves based on that.  We don&#39;t compare ourselves to a perfect and holy God who views even the smallest sin as we would view a child molesting, murdering pedophile.  We just can&#39;t comprehend it.  That&#39;s why he had to shed his blood for us to pay the price for us.  If one doesn&#39;t realize what they actually are and the state they are in, they will experience his perfect wrath.</p>

<p>Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. </p>

<p>Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>

<p>Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p>Rom_5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</p>

<p>Rom_5:9  Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</p>

<p>Eph 2:8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Eph 2:9  Not of works, lest any man should boast. </p>

<p>Repent and believe this to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a reason the entire world claims it&#39;s least authentic!  The world wants to keep people from the truth.  In the KJV it&#39;s very clear that Lucifer himself has been given dominion here.  He controls the kingdoms, he gives them to who he wills.  He is the small &quot;g&quot; god of this world:</p>

<p>Luk 4:5  And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
Luk 4:6  And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.</p>

<p>2Co_4:4  In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</p>

<p>God gives people what they want (like when Israel demanded a king against his counsel and he gave them one).  Humanity naturally wants to reject God and welcomes deception, so he has allowed us to be ruled spiritually by Lucifer and his fallen angels who have us living in a giant fantasy.  So of course he would set it up so everything points away from the truth.</p>

<p>Knowing the KJV is the pure preserved word is a spiritual discernment thing for one but also can be proven when you compare verses across versions.  There are also so many things set up to discredit it such as the fantasy &quot;Unicorns&quot; that are pushed in media.  Uni (one) cornus (horn) is just a one horded Rhino called Rhinoceros unicornis: </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rhinoceros">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rhinoceros</a></p>

<p>This is a strong beast that can&#39;t be used to farm which is exactly what the  KJV describes.  You go other stuff like Mark of the Best prophesy.  KJV is the only one to place the mark &quot;in&quot; the hand or forehead.  </p>

<p>Rev 13:16  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 
Rev 13:17  And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. </p>

<p>All others say &quot;on&quot;.  When modern translators in their pride couldn&#39;t imagine how something that involves buying and selling would be inside you they &quot;corrected&quot; it but the KJV was correct all along:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azEivPKGMvk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azEivPKGMvk</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6n26bBBr80">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6n26bBBr80</a></p>

<p>There is so much more study that goes into this but this is just a small example.  A guy named Dr. Peter S. Ruckman put together a many hour long presentation called &quot;Advanced Manuscript Evidence&quot; that has been taken down from Youtube (of course).  So I think it&#39;s only available on old DVD&#39;s now.  That&#39;s one of the best studies I&#39;ve ever seen if you can get hold of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the information. One last question I had, how do you feel about all the other holy books or legends?

    <div class="md"><p>No problem, happy to share.  I believe they all stem from Babylon.  The reason they have so many similarities is because they were taught by spiritual beings that were very aware of the truth.  These would be fallen angels or perhaps Lucifer himself.  If you look at how a guy like John Milton openly admits he got the information he wrote down in Paradise Lost for instance (dictated via dreams) you can see the spiritual connection.  Even more modern writers like Philip K Dick admit to being controlled by some &quot;higher being&quot; when they were writing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vcv8hZcpM94&amp;amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vcv8hZcpM94&amp;amp;t</a></p>

<p>I believe these fallen spiritual beings have influenced humanity all over the wold and created all the false religions.  That would include everything in those types of texts.  So yeah, I believe they all come from the same spiritual source (Lucifer and his fallen angels masquerading as whatever)</p>

<p>2Co_11:14  And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</p>

<p>They can put on a very good show and give real temporal power here on earth.  Compared to the true God who is currently only speaking through his born again saints and wants people to use their free will to come to him in repentance and accept his grace through faith in his finished work on the Cross that comes with a future promise.  You can see how our flesh is more lively to accept the here and now.  So humanity was easily deceived by these lying spirits that are able to influence this place in their favor.</p>

<p>I will pray for you and wish you the best seeking truth!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good talking to you. And thank you. I would say as a musician and a writer myself, what you are describing with pk dick and Milton is just something commonly felt by all writers. The Greeks called it the muses. But it’s just the right hemisphere of the brain most likely being unimpeded by the left. Check out “ the origin of consciousness” by Julian Jaynes. Stay good. 🙏</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Hundred-Years-Before-Christ/dp/0879517204">Jesus-100 years before Christ</a> by Alvar Ellegard argues that the letters from Paul to the Churches never mention any personal anecdotes or encounters with people who knew Jesus. The focus is on &quot;Jesus who is in Heaven&quot;. There is a little bit about a Last Supper, but Paul talks about Jesus as someone long-ago dead.</p>

<p>So...the Gospels may have been written <em>after</em> Paul&#39;s letters (to churches that seem well-established already) to flesh-out a life for the ever-more-popular Christian prophet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is the possibility that some are authentic documents. I wouldn&#39;t automatically discount their contents as &quot;not authentic&quot; just because they are considered &quot;gnostic&quot;. I&#39;m not the expert on the matter, but there are commentaries that dissect them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really feel like early christianity was probably much more like buddhism. Jesus was trying to reform the people of their idol worship and animal sacrificing, to teach them of the one &quot;universal God&quot; which was really just a metaphor for the infinite consciousness behind you, me, and everything. </p>

<p>And what is so ironic is that the church which came after him turned him into one of the very &#39;gods&#39; which he was trying to turn the people away from in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They very well could be.  The Gnostic wolves entered into the Church right away while the Apostles walked the earth:</p>

<p>Act 20:28  Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
 
Act 20:29  For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</p>

<p>Act 20:30  Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. </p>
