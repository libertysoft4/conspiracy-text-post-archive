    <div class="md"><p>AB has spoken out against her publicly on multiple occasions. </p>

<p>Much like other dirty politicians in this country...No dirt he potentially had will ever amount to her seeing the inside of a cell. </p>

<p>The reality is that Clinton and trump have been lifelong friends, and any facade of rivalry put on during the election was just an attempt to sway voters...they both play for the same team in the end, and as long as real independents like Bernie Sanders don&#39;t gain political traction, the wealthy donors to both Republicans and Democrats don&#39;t really care who wins.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same story it&#39;s always been, create false narratives to keep the American people from uniting under and independent candidate who would change the corporate welfare system we currently have. As long as common Democrats keep blaming Republicans and vice versa, nothing will ever happen.  </p>

<p>The truth is that 70% of this country is not associated with either party, and the only task for both parties each election is to keep those people from banding together and electing real populist candidates.  At this point, we are so far in debt, that we are completely subservient to corporate interests to keep our economy viable....even if someone like Bernie were to be elected, those corporations could easily cause economic disaster and blame it &quot;socialist policies&quot;. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get caught up in any celebrity garbage that tries to implicate one candidate or the other...your only recourse is to educate your peers about the need for political overhaul led by politicians not associated with either party...beyond that, all of these stories are a waste of time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>imo? not a ruse, she is morally bankrupt and i personally want time in the ring with her..  he&#39;s controlled opposition. trump will fix things, in some ways that will affect us both negatively and positively... at this juncture, i believe trump is a very specific manchurian candidate... he will build the country back up financially, make them feel all special again, and then he will sit back as the economy crashes... our whole political focus is narrowed at two very small people in the grand scheme... there is a whole world outside our domain... that whether we talk about it or not, it does affect us. the suiciding of queen maxima&#39;s sister... the saudi princes&#39; arrests, the saudi princess&#39;s yt video... savile. heath. hastert. bush. bush. clinton. podesta. </p>

<p>they will sink the dnc to maintain order, if they have to (in a couple years time, there would be a &quot;reimagined&quot; and &quot;reformed&quot; dnc, mark my words)... right now they have that in donald trump... his stances on Israel, for example. with the exception of donald trump, zionists and some, not even all, Israeli&#39;s, who supports their continued malevolence?</p>

<p>You know what they say about that right?</p>

<p>It took me not ten seconds looking at your history to see: </p>

<p>So, you obviously are looking to waste people&#39;s time.  You don&#39;t give two shits about the links.  Yes, I&#39;m <em>lying</em>, Trump doesn&#39;t refer to it quite consistently.  And even your link he says &quot;we&#39;ll have people that will do things&quot;.  It&#39;s far from over.   </p>
