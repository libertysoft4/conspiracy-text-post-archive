        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s a lot more to this Parkland shooting hoax than some crisis actor with political aspirations, or some bullshit about the sheriff not prosecuting teen crime.</p>

<p>What we should be talking about is how it appears the Parkland shooting is likely a hoax, or a possible set up by the FBI.  This was Sandy Hook 2.0</p>

<p>Most of the witnesses interviewed said they had a fake code-red drill in the morning, a practice run basically where students were taught about active shooter response.  Teachers and students reported they were warned officers would fire blanks, people would scream, and there would be fake bodies.  Then Nikolas Cruz just happens to show up later that day in an Uber,  and now they can run a code-red live?  </p>

<p>That&#39;s why FBI and law enforcement responded so quick, they were already there set up and ready to go after the morning practice run</p>

<p>All witness testimony points to the shooting being just another drill.  Many students said they thought they had just been through another drill, and didn&#39;t know it was a real shooting until they saw the news later after school. 
 A student saw Nikolas Cruz exiting the school with a group of students while shots were being fired on the other side of the building.  Other students reported a shooter on each stairwell (2 total in the freshman building - one on each side), trapping them inside and forcing them into classrooms.</p>

<p>And all this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Not a shred of actual evidence has been shown that this was anything but a drill, or that Nikolas Cruz did any shooting.  Not a single Facebook, Instagram, or social media account can be found for any of the victims that existed before the shooting.  </p>

<p>Cruz was a kid that no one liked.  He was autistic, had emotional problems, and had no friends. No one is going to miss him.  How he was able to afford a small arsenal on a DollarTree salary has not been revealed.</p>

<p>There is so much to this story I&#39;m considering writing an entire book.  The lack of any real discussion <em>here</em> of all places really serves to demonstrates how heavily brigaded this sub has become. 
 I guess this sub&#39;s real purpose is to simply quarantine and squash these conspiracies so they don&#39;t spread to the sheep</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, this is like Sandy Hook all over again, they completely lost the plot pretty much immediately. It would be awesome if you wrote a book about all of the strange anomalies and problems with the official story. I only woke up to the fact that Sandy Hook was a hoax after Pizzagate broke, I think a lot of people were woken up in a similar fashion as a result of the last election cycle. This kind of bullshit needs to be exposed, the time is now.</p>

<p>Why should we ever pay attention to them? I hate the news. I don&#39;t need to hear about every time someone gets killed, day in and day out.  I don&#39;t know why people get as obsessed about these events as they are with celebrities and anything else on TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need to know. Sorry about their loss, but I can&#39;t do anything about it. It adds nothing to my life knowing about it, but it <em>is</em> a distraction and negativity. I don&#39;t need to hear all the negative stories. Anytime someone dies tragically it must be reported on TV, and <em>everyone</em> needs to know about it! God forbid if I am spared from hearing about the latest massacre. Whatever would I do if I don&#39;t know about it??</p>

<p>The only time I&#39;m exposed to CNN is at a doctor&#39;s office, which is thankfully drowned out by my earphones listening to absolutely anything in the world else. I get useful news from other sources, just not from brain-dead talking heads on the Big Brother Screen. The most annoying sound in the world is the way news anchors speak, with their ridiculously fake cadence, and indifference to the carnage they report. Robots would be better, but in fact I&#39;ll avoid it altogether. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But anytime someone dies tragically it is NOT exposed on television. My aunt and uncle died in a plane crash and let me tell you, cnn did not cover it. There are only certain events that cnn headlines, and the way they unfold are not the way a real tragedy unfolds. In particular... people not being rushed to the hospital to be properly treated and possibly save a life. </p>

I agree, yet these those things are quite evidently part of the larger conspiratorial picture.  So what&#39;s wrong with discussing them?</p>

<p>A student saw Nikolas Cruz exiting the school with a group of students while shots were being fired on the other side of the building. Other students reported a shooter on each stairwell (2 total in the freshman building - one on each side), trapping them inside and forcing them into classrooms.</p>

<p>Could you cite the source of these claims?  I haven&#39;t been following too closely this last week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lack of any real discussion here of all places really serves to demonstrates how heavily brigaded this sub has become.
The meaningful discussions delving deeper into the conspiracy are abundant if you sort by new posts and don&#39;t mind sifting through the noise.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post OP.  Everyone needs to watch this video for proof of the fact that it was psyop/drill, and that the students were told there would be a &quot;code red&quot; active shooter drill that day, with &quot;cops firing blanks&quot;:</p>

<p>You all need to remember that this is just merely a game. </p>

<p>A game for those who own you, the most power elite of this world.</p>

<p>The last bastion of your freedom is sitting in your home right now, a gun. These school shootings, and other gun related incidents are just causing mass hysteria among the people to trick them to give up there last bastion of freedom, there guns. </p>

<p>The goal has always, and will always be to disarm the people. Either they do it by force, or they use means by making ourselves do it.</p>

<p>Sure this kid was crazy, but what was done to stop his shooting spree, nothing, it was allowed to happen. They are slowly but surely chipping away at our right to bear arms.</p>
