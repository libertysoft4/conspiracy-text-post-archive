    <div class="md"><p>Well for example, our government is laying out the same policies that preceded Nazi Germany&#39;s rise. And WE as citizens have done nothing but complain about it on social media. Since WE as citizens won&#39;t physically show our disapproval and use OUR constitutional right to abolish government, WE as citizens are saying that we don&#39;t give a fuck about what&#39;s coming.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you’re saying OP and I think you were taking the approach of whacking people over the head with your concept. I agree with it, we are heading down the same path as pre-nazi Germany (cue some shill to turn this into a D/R debate). I think this would have garnered more traction with a less “up your ass” approach. It’s an important message that this community should be open to. Thanks for the post and daring concept!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but when we deny people due process and lock them up unlawfully, we call the places we keep them &quot;detention centers&quot; instead of &quot;concentration camps&quot;. We also base it on nationality instead of ethnicity, so I guess that&#39;s better somehow. We also only do genocide in the middle East anymore, so we don&#39;t mass murder Americans anymore ever since most of the Native Americans went away. Only our convicted criminals are prison slaves, too, it&#39;s not like we just lock people up or enslave them based on race. I mean, it has been confirmed that the &quot;war on drugs&quot; was engineered specifically to target racial minorities for disenfranchisement, and the legal concept of chattel slavery was originally built right in to the Constitution, but at least the state isn&#39;t killing racial minorities unjustly. We&#39;d never do that, can you imagine if agents of the state kept getting killing unarmed black men on video? And it&#39;s not like we&#39;d invade nations with unjust wars in blatant grabs to expand our empire. We&#39;re better than the Nazis. We are. </p>

It was basically a bait and switch, on a global scale, and solidified that the US would be the military wing (power) of Rome (ie. Tri-Sovereign States). Which is why Rome had the Vatican rat lines, and the US brought so many Nazis over via Operation Paperclip. <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3CUmXbBFVAo/VIX0JbyKsXI/AAAAAAAAKTc/4ALYxELnWu4/s1600/state_of_the_union_facses%2Bstate%2B2.jpg">There is a reason why there are Roman Fasces hanging on the walls of the house of representatives.</a> There are Roman Fasces and other symbols all over DC.</p>

<p>&quot;After the war, some of those responsible for crimes committed during the Holocaust were brought to trial. Nuremberg, Germany, was chosen as a site for trials that took place in 1945 and 1946. Judges from the Allied powers—Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States—presided over the hearings of twenty-two major Nazi criminals.&quot;</p>

<p>Only some of them were brought to trial. Seven major war criminals sentenced to prison terms are placed in the Spandau Prison in Berlin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I found most shocking was the realisation that we didnt actually &#39;win&#39; anything, the Nazi&#39;s weren&#39;t &#39;defeated&#39; - rather, they were imported, employed and protected by U.S. and U.K. governments (and other Allied governments), and encouraged to continue the human experimentation and chemical warfare they were so keen on. </p>

<p>Operation Paperclip begat MKNAOMI begat MKULTRA begat MONARCH...and so on. The only difference is, none of those experiments focused specifically on one race, using instead as subjects - children, students, homeless and intransigent people, prisoners, criminals, people with mental illness, even 2s4government employees (Frank Olson, anyone? Threw himself out of a window/was murdered, having been covertly dosed with LSD by his employer, the CIA) etc etc. </p>

<p>So despite the intent not changing (ie human torture), these experiments would no longer be termed &quot;eugenics&quot;, but rather &quot;science&quot;. </p>

<p>Interesting historical tidbit - Hitler&#39;s first crack at the &#39;Final Solution&#39; was The Madagascar Plan. He wanted to round up all the Jews and deport them to Madagascar, which he envisaged as a kind of country-sized concentration camp, staffed by armed guards. The British blockade made it impossible initially, and then eventually the Nazi&#39;s figured out it would be cheaper and easier to round up the Jews and imprison and slaughter them in locally, without the need for a trip off the coast of Africa.   </p>

<p>Hitler was obsessed with the Boer War (where there were concentration camps), and the American genocide of the Native American peoples (and the subsequent Reservation system for the remaining few still stubbornly alive), so he was just following the rules of war already in play... Rules the UK and the US had already set down, in fact.</p>

<p>John Toland wrote in his book, Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography:</p>

<p>&quot;Hitler’s concept of concentration camps as well as the practicality of genocide owed much, so he claimed, to his studies of English and United States history. He admired the camps for Boer prisoners in South Africa and for the Indians in the wild west; and often praised to his inner circle the efficiency of America’s extermination—by starvation and uneven combat—of the red savages who could not be tamed by captivity.” </p>

<p>President Thomas Jefferson said that the “(American Indian has) justified (their own) extermination&quot;, and George Washington thought the most effective way to kill Native Americans was a slash and burn policy, saying &quot;The immediate objectives are the total destruction and devastation of their settlements...essential to ruin their crops on the ground and prevent them planting more&quot;.</p>

<p>We have been told all our lives that we are the &#39;goodies&#39;, that we &#39;triumphed&#39; over evil when the Allies won WW2 and &#39;beat&#39; Hitler - but you know what they say about histories written by the victor. </p>

<p>The awful truth is that we assimilated the Nazi&#39;s, gave them the resources and State sanctions to do as they pleased, and the world moved on.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Churchill was a monster too</p>
