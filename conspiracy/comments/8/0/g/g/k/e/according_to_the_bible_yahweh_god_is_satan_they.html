        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>All through the bible, the old testament especially, there are stories about an evil god who loves blood sacrifices, genocides, infanticides, sexism, xenophobia, cruel and overbearing punishments, on and on.  It&#39;s easy to infer that Satan and Yahweh might be one and the same.</p>

<p>But we don&#39;t have to infer.  Today I&#39;ll show you that in the bible, it points out very clearly that Yahweh and Satan are, in fact, the same person.</p>

<p>The bible wrote down more than one account of the rule of David, one of their major patriarchs.  It was recorded in Samuel and in Chronicles.  Much of it is even copied down near verbatim.  I&#39;ll link the relevant chapters here, but it&#39;s the first verse of each that is important.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+24&amp;amp;version=NIV">2 Samuel 24</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again the anger of the Lord burned against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, “Go and take a census of Israel and Judah.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Chronicles+21&amp;amp;version=NIV">1 Chronicles 21</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you see that?  God commanded David to do something &quot;evil&quot;.  And in the mirrored recording in Chronicles, it was Satan who challenged him to do it.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a believer in the God Inspired Scriptures, and believe that they are always true, then it naturally follows, that you are following Satan.  It would certainly explain why God loves violence and bloodshed so much.</p>

<p>And if this whopper of a revelation isn&#39;t quite enough, wait...  there&#39;s more!  :)</p>

<p>Not only does Yahweh = Satan, but the New Testament chimes in, and reveals further conflicts within the text.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:13-15">James 1:13-15</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>13 When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But God/Satan just tempted David into doing evil...?  Why would &quot;James&quot; write down something that&#39;s so clearly false?  Well, maybe &quot;God&quot; was feeling generous after he tricked his beloved people, and let them off easy, right?</p>

<p>Nope.  God decided that in order to properly punish David for this greivous crime of counting humans (which god told him to do), he would unleash a plague on Israel that would kill <em>seventy thousand people</em>.  Isn&#39;t god good?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave various links here as well, showing, from the bible, how god possesses people, incites them to violence, and then punishes them for being possessed by &quot;god&quot;.  He even allows human sacrifice from time to time.  He doesn&#39;t even punish the people who sacrifice humans, although counting humans and trimming sideburns are grievous offenses...</p>

<p>&quot;Western&quot; civilization has been under the mind control of Satan/God for thousands of years.  Each of the children of this abrahamic cancer point fingers at each other and assume that they&#39;re more righteous than the others, but they <em>all</em> serve the evil one.  Catholic.  Protestant.  Jewish.  Muslim.  All followers.  Of the evil one.</p>

<p>Extras:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+11%3A30-39&amp;amp;version=NIV">God digs human sacrifice</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+10:1-2">He &quot;hardens pharaoh&#39;s heart</a> so that he can punish him further.  This culminates in the infanticide of every firstborn of Egypt, which is still celebrated today.  Yay infanticide!, apparently...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2016:23">The evil spirit called &quot;God&quot; possesses Saul</a>, making him hate David for no reason.  This evil spirit of god later makes Saul try to kill David.  The entire conflict spanned years, and culminated with Saul being killed/punished by god.  Poor guy...</p>

<p>Now stretch out, touch your toes, and get ready to see some mental gymnastics incoming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Passages in 2 Sam 24 and I Chron 21 do seem in opposition; then, there are dozens of other passages that draw clear distinction between God and His fallen angel.  When this happens, I typically start digging contextually into passages well before and well after the apparent contradiction.  Your point is an interesting one, and it&#39;ll definitely have me reading/examining more deeply.  Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.  </p>

<p>I think that some of the confusion happens because the bible &quot;deliberately&quot; conflates &quot;Yahweh&quot; and &quot;Elohim&quot;.  Most people don&#39;t realize that the god of the bible is often referred to as a collection of gods.</p>

<p>This passage in Samuel just adds to the confusion, by using both versions multiple times in the same chapter.  It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s by design :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are too many to list, but they vary in importance.  This is one of the more &quot;devastating&quot; contradictions, since it addresses the nature of &quot;god&quot; himself.  For casual Christians, it may not mehtter, but for Bible purists, who think it&#39;s the divinely inspired verbatim word of god?  It makes them... uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Clearly, he wants a free creation that does good deeds. The Purists are ignorant of God and so are you as you assume to know  the nature of God from a book from human scribes.</p>

<p>Real question, you don&#39;t seem to know much about the Bible you post a lot of odd things. Are you a Satanist trying to unlock other people who might also be Satanists? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The passage in 2Samuel 24 (1) does not say God told David. instead it says God was angery at David and david was moved to count the people.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why later God is angry because David let his pride make him arrogant enough to count all his men of the land. He was going against God. 1chronicles24 tells us who moved david, it was Satan. God&#39;s anger and Satan convincing David are two different things. In the Original Hebrew, it is very clear that God is angry and &quot;something&quot; moves David to do evil.</p>

<p>All over the Bible, we know the Adversary is Satan, he cannot over power anyone but those who submit to his suggestion. He even had the power to tempt Jesus himself. The Law is Do as Thou Wilt and be righteous. Satan inverts the Law of God. The judgment is already passed on him but he wants to claim other souls with deception and pride. He has no power over people is just an influencer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pointing out the error in your translation as it does not say &quot; God said...&quot;  you are infering that and your argument that Satan and God are one person has no support. No proof of either.</p>

<p>(in the Hebrew, we note the two sentences) God was angry (COMMA) and it moved David to count the people. Do you see the point? You are assuming it was God that moved David. But God gives no such command.  In Job God allows Job to be tested, Satan himself comes to heaven, and God allows him to test Job&#39;s attachment to wealth and health. is it possible God allowed Satan to test David?? yes.</p>

<p>because David has the Will to do as he wishes. Hence even if Satan tells him, he can say No.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume you don&#39;t understand that Hebrew language. Translations of the Old testament require Hebrew Greek lexicon, every word the translators used is numbered in Hebrew to create accuracy. Everytime the word Adversary is used to mean &quot;Satan&quot; it is different number than general use of the word &quot;adversary&quot; </p>

<p>So everytime we are dealing with the Satan, the person, noun we get H7853, H7854 etc...</p>

<p>You are correct that in Genesis 3, we are talking about a different entity. &quot;Satan&quot; is sometimes used as adjective  to describe those of his crew of demons and other times as Himself in person</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good, then you understand my argument against you is not even based on conviction but simple reference of the verses you presented. The verse in Samuel does not indicate anywhere that God commanded David to count the people. The person who tells David is named in 1chonicles21. </p>

<p>Every man has the weight of his will and his deeds, Even David is stripped of his power and his crown is taken from him by his sons. Wicked men hold great powers and the very righteous men lose everything. Every man is judged by his deeds, he does as he wills as long as he lives on earth but no man has great power forever. in this fleeting playground men wager their eternal souls as bargaining chip to play the game of material life. Free will has consequence and judgment associated with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t follow it up on the other comment because now you&#39;re just nitpicking over one word, &quot;moves&quot; or something along those lines.  This is irrelevant, because the <em>action</em>, the pushing, the encouragement, the possession, whatever you want to call it, this action was directly from the one called god.  </p>

<p>So debating over which verb was used, or how active vs passive it was, is just handwaving around the fact that it was god who compelled/prodded/encouraged/commanded David&#39;s actions.  And in the other book, recording this same story, the same character called &quot;god&quot; is also &quot;Satan&quot;, the adversary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again, 2Sameul 24 1 and 10 prove that God was not the one, in fact he 2samuel 24-10 David prays for forgiveness for doing something God did not allow or command. It is poor translation of 2Samuel24-1 that creates this wrong conclusion for you or you refuse to see what verse is saying. David is not good, 1Chronicles, we see God  even sends his angel to destroy David until he repents.</p>

<p>Your premises is that God allows evil, but God allows free will. David is a man who lives by the sword, he is waging war counting men in his land. God is angry wit him for Saul&#39;s death, there is a Famine because of that. David is no better any other king, he breaks God&#39;s commandment to be just and not shed blood. Israel is constantly destroyed because of the evil they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP has no idea the context of 1Samuel and 2 Samuel. It is the story of an awful King David, who like Saul commits evil upon evil to cover his bad deeds. The Wrath of God is upon him and his People. He reacts to this wrath with arrogance and counts the might and numbers of his army, his action is a reaction to the anger of God. Not God telling him to do it.</p>

That certain family(s) captured in Babylon used the ancient texts there, mashed many together, and gave themselves a political and religious excuse to emigrate from Babylon into Canaan, claiming the area as their own &quot;promised land&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I think so.  The word for god in the old testament switches to &quot;Elohim&quot; frequently, which is a plural collection of gods.  This &quot;group&quot; acts mostly in unison, not always, and they seem to be under authority of one who is more &quot;ruthless&quot; than the others.</p>

<p>But &quot;Satan&quot; is a minor character in the Bible.  His &quot;big appearance&quot; is in the book of Job, and he&#39;s just an underling of god.  He doesn&#39;t control much or fight with god the way Christian&#39;s like to portray.</p>

<p>And since Abraham came from Sumer, it seems a perfect fit, that this Sumerian pantheon of gods was converted into a Hyksos version.  The &quot;monotheism&quot; side of it wasn&#39;t very dominant, until closer to 500bc, when it was used as a way to take over land from the Canaanites.  There is no archaeological or written evidence from the time that shows heavy monotheism in the region. (besides the bible, edited later).</p>

<p>Power of this world is there to be taken and plundered, it is the whiskey of foolish men. Saul falls and David becomes more evil than him. Nebuchadnezzar comes along and David&quot;s kingdom is plundered and robbed. Darius comes along and Plunders Nebuchadnezzar Kingdom and so on it goes...</p>

<p>Righteous men need no worldly kingdom, they need no sword and no crown.</p>

<p>&quot;Say to the people of Israel, Any one of the people of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones. I myself will set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given one of his children to Molech, to make my sanctuary unclean and to profane my holy name. And if the people of the land do at all close their eyes to that man when he gives one of his children to Molech, and do not put him to death, then I will set my face against that man and against his clan and will cut them off from among their people, him and all who follow him in whoring after Molech. ...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what God said about sacrifice:</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 18:10 says:</p>

<p>&quot;There shall not be found among you anyone who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, anyone who practices divination or tells fortunes or interprets omens, or a sorcerer.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, never use an NIV translation.</p>

<p>It says he gave his daughter up for the lord, as a nun would give her service...that&#39;s why she wept for never being able to marry a sister you had to go into service to God a virgin.</p>

<p>There is NO stating he sacrificed her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good info, I like that you researched into this stuff. </p>

<p>Looking into it a bit more in context it seems there is much more to the story. </p>

<p>My interpretation from reading the various chapters is that David&#39;s motives for the census where wrong, and probably that conducting a census generally was offensive to God, who had promised to multiply them like the stars in the heavens. </p>

<p>Also, Joab (who took the census) was against it and asked David why make Israel sin like this (by taking a census)? For some reason the tribes of Benjamin and Levi were even left out of the census too and the census never actually recorded (and numbers given are not the same).</p>

<p>So it seems to me Satan tempted David, probably using God&#39;s own words and promises to multiply his people, to conduct a census for war or tax or both, to continue more war outside his current lands (bring in more land, more forgieners, more richess, power, ect). </p>

<p>God I believe does not tempt. If David&#39;s heart was already turned to Satan&#39;s ear in the matter, even if God righteously commanded David to conduct a census, if he did it with evil motives it is a sin. </p>

<p>In fact, 2 Samuel 24:10 says that &quot;David&#39;s heart condemed him after he had numbered the people.</p>

<p>God always uses the bad for good, one stone lays upon the next. The story ends with David buying and building an altar on the threshing floor of araunah the jebusite, which I believe (I&#39;ll double check) is the supposed site of the temple.</p>

This is one of the more &quot;devastating&quot; contradictions, since it addresses the nature of &quot;god&quot; himself.
