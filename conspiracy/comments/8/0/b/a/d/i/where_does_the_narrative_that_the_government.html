        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On a law-enforcement level, police have no problem abusing the rights of citizens, and those who defend themselves are both few and far between and rarely successful. In the case of deliberate ramping up of laws and police enforcement, gun ownership is a fairly minor obstacle. I might even argue that in the &#39;big picture&#39; armed resistance would be beneficial, since a rising police state could paint its agents as martyrs fighting against a violent element in society. </p>

<p>In regard to weakening potential large-scale rebellions, the idea that a world power could be overturned by a violent civilian coup has been fairly unlikely for decades. While it would certainly be <em>easier</em> to defeat a rebellion if they had to rely exclusively on foreign-sourced or stolen weapons, automatic small arms just don&#39;t seem to me to pose a serious enough threat against a modern mechanized force. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>of the examples listed there, the only one that I think is comparable to the modern united states or another developed country is Germany, and I don&#39;t even think germany needed to do it. The near universal indoctrination of the population into nazi ideology would make the formation of a viable structured resistance difficult, armed or not.</p>

<p>I do agree that disarming the population in underdeveloped countries is an important step to securing a regime, but only because the government itself is usually weaker and less organized, making resistance a much more viable option even for small, poorly-equipped groups.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_legislation_in_Germany#Gun_regulation_of_the_Third_Reich">Literally, the opposite happened</a> which is enough to discredit the whole article. The closest to disarmament was how Jews in occupied territories were forbidden from owning guns and the obvious discrimination they suffered in Germany.  </p>

<p>I was going to look more carefully at all of the claims but considering how blatantly they lied, I see no reason to believe anything they wrote is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Iraq. </p>

<p>The elite Revolutionary Guard simply buried their available weapons smaller than a tank, melted into the population, and initiated a 6-year guerrilla war to oust the invaders. The strategy was pre-planned, and it worked, except the ethnic tensions that were already present, but also inflamed and entrenched by occupiers and neighbors alike, made it a very messy affair for all involved, and the overall geo-political issue of Iraq&#39;s future is still unresolved. </p>

Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin&#39;s thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt!

    <div class="md"><p>True. It was an attitude of hopelessness that enabled the Gulag.</p>

<p>But where exactly did the hopelessness come from? Solzhenitsyn focused on that question, and as far as I can tell (correct me if you have a better answer) it was faith in oneself, and faith in God - both remarkably assailed by Bolshevism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, issue that everyone seems to be missing: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare"><strong>Asymmetric warfare</strong></a></p>

<p>Of course a modern army could defeat a bunch of &quot;patriots&quot; with AR-15&#39;s and 500 rounds: if they all obligingly came together in a large concentration to contest the hostile takeover, they&#39;d be squashed.</p>

<p>But if the millions of ragtag &quot;patriots&quot; went everywhere the hypothetical opposing modern army was <em>not</em> securely positioned, hit and run style, the occupation could be made intolerable for the invaders (see Iraq for a recent example that has been somewhat obscured by our US media).</p>

<p>The American Revolution was in many ways an example of asymmetrical warfare, even though Washington tried very hard to assume the trappings of a standard european army. The contrast can be seen in these two wikis:</p>

<p>This is what Washington needed to get European, primarily French, military intervention:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army</a></p>

<p>But this is what actually enabled the permanent separation from Britain:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_(United_States)#American_Revolutionary_War_(1775%E2%80%931783)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_(United_States)#American_Revolutionary_War_(1775%E2%80%931783)</a></p>

<p>I think the 2nd Amendment can be seen as a signal that the founders knew the reality of how a ragtag group beat the greatest military power in the world.</p>

<p>Today, just as in Iraq, the issue with any war-game scenario of Americans resorting to their AR-15&#39;s instead of other, and far preferable, standard political measures short of rebellion, is the status of the very large number of trained veterans, and the arsenals that separately store munitions and heavy weapons. I urge you to think about that carefully, and respond if you have an intelligent spark fly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there would be a difference but I don&#39;t think that it would be significant enough for either side to worry about it. Of course I&#39;m not a military expert so that belief is probably somewhat misguided. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you underestimate the significance.  The current wars show the limitations of drones and that is in mostly open desert.  It also shows that occupation still requires boots on the ground.  Look at the mental illness that our soldiers suffer from after being in the Middle East <em>even with</em> the mental protection of killing “others”.</p>

<p>Now try to translate that to our own people.  A single sniper can demoralize a large number of troops.  Killing people demoralizes them.  Ambush harassment demoralizes them.  Attacking their own citizens especially will.</p>

<p>In the USA, the effect an armed population would have on a military assault would be Iraqi or Afghani insurgency multiplied by several hundred factors.</p>

<p>It would not be an easy task at all.</p>
