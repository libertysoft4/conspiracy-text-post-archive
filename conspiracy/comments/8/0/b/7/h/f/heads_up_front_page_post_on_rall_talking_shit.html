    <div class="md"><p>Reddit Enhancement Suite. It&#39;s an API for your PC browser (no mobile version AFAIK), and it&#39;s awesome and I highly recommend you check it out.</p>

<p>One of the perks of it, is that you can tag users with custom color and custom text banners. I mark people that are open minded or just in general capable of having civil and rational discussions of ideas (whether I agree with them or not) with a green tag that has a breif description of why I marked them green. Users that are not here for conversation, and are only here to forum slide, insult those whom disagree with them, or just typical &quot;shill&quot; behavior with a red tag, and a note about what topics they were shilling for. And then I also mark people in orange when I&#39;m not sure if they are shilling, and adjust it later on if I see them doing it repeatedly (because sometimes people just have bad ideas or bad days and become an asshole to anonymous people online).</p>

<p>Once I started doing that, it&#39;s amazing how quickly I was able to recognize that there are many users that are not interested in discussing ideas or talking about conspiracy theories, yet they show up anytime a specific topic is posted in this sub (pizzagate, vaccines, Sandy Hook, Trump/Russia stuff, etc.)</p>

<p>It really makes reddit slightly more tolerable to browse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not for &quot;collusion&quot;, and not for the original claims about Russians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and submitting them to Wikileaks. All there&#39;s evidence for is a Russian clickbait farm that allegedly committed fraud that bought about $44,000 of Facebook ads before the election (many of which were not Pro-Trump), some financial corruption in the part of Manafort and Gates that has nothing to do with the Russiagate narrative itself, and procedural crimes (i.e. lying to the FBI).

<p>Except, neither WikiLeaks nor anyone else ever published Hillary Clinton&#39;s 33,000 deleted emails, and they were already widely discussed publicly at that point. So if that&#39;s the one you meant, it&#39;s quite a reach.</p>

<p>The Russian hacking &quot;evidence&quot; is highly disputed, since no government agency was ever allowed to examine the servers, and instead had to rely on a DNC contractor of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4376628/New-questions-claim-Russia-hacked-election.html">dubious credibility</a> and numerous conflicts of interest, who declined to testify under oath about their findings for some reason.

And that&#39;s without even going into all the <a href="http://g-2.space">Guccifer 2.0 fuckery</a> with artificially planted &quot;Russian fingerprints&quot; being presented uncritically as proof of Russian-ness...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care how &quot;respected&quot; they are, I care about the evidence. Like the way their attribution of an alleged hack of a Ukrainian artillery app to one of the same threat groups was repudiated by everyone from the Ukrainian government to the app creator, forcing them to retract major parts of their claims. That&#39;s what happened when the data they based the attribution on was publicly available for scrutiny. And yet when it isn&#39;t, we&#39;re supposed to blindly trust them? </p>

<p>Every bit of evidence cited as showing Guccifer 2.0 was even Russian (let alone GRU) was the result of a deliberate choice he made, from pasting the text of documents into a Russian-language MS Word template and saving it with a Russian username, to using a Russian VPN service to show a Russian IP address when he emailed journalists. The surest thing we can say about Guccifer 2.0 is that he really really wanted us to think he was &quot;secretly&quot; Russian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interestingly, it might not even have been that for Podesta. If you look at the timestamps, the Podesta archive extends about 48 hours past the email where the phishing scam is identified Podesta&#39;s assistant says she&#39;s changing the password and setting up two-factor verification. Those two additional days are tricky to explain if you assume it all came from the phishing email they responded promptly to. One theory is that shortly after this scare, Podesta may have wanted to switch to a new email hackers wouldn&#39;t know, saved his email archive, and that this archive is what was stolen.</p>

<p>Julian Assange has no credibility to me when it comes to Seth Rich. He can&#39;t have it both ways; he can&#39;t say in one breath they don&#39;t reveal sources and in the next try to imply Rich is the leaker and expect us to believe him, especially when it&#39;s in his direct interest to have people believe the emails were leaked and not hacked.  WikiLeaks actual leaks have never been shown to be false or fabricated, but I have much less faith in him as a person. I&#39;m not alleging anything, but I don&#39;t unquestioningly believe him either. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say Rich isn&#39;t the leaker and wasn&#39;t killed for it, but I don&#39;t see JA&#39;s insinuation that he is to be compelling in the least. He&#39;s not a disinterested party here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikileaks currency is it&#39;s reputation, and it&#39;s reputation would be and was being damaged by the allegations that he had been publishing hacked, stolen documents. By suggesting the documents were actually leaked by an insider who was subsequently murdered, it shifted the narrative (to the extent people bought it) to the WikiLeaks being a bastion of truth and and a supporter of whistle-blowers, and away from the notion that it had become a puppet of the Kremlin. </p>

<p>At the time, and at least <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg">as early as Aug, 2016</a>, Assange was facing criticism that he was working with the Russians and/or trying to harm Clinton&#39;s campaign. This was a few months before the election. If JA actually was working with/for Russia or against Clinton — either for money, ideology, or self-preservation — than he had all the more reason to imply Rich, and not Russia, was the source of the documents. </p>

<p>Sure, I&#39;ve discussed this many times over the last year. The DNC is as corrupt as they come, same as the GOP. But as much as the source of the leaks are irrelevant to discussion of what the contents of the leaks show, so is that content irrelevant when trying to determine what the source of the leaks is. That&#39;s the present topic. </p>

<p>And WL&#39;s unbroken record of accurate leaks has quite little to do with JA&#39;s personal remarks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly, but it feels to me that Julian Assange chose to bend the rules here since he knew that the potential leakers are already in such danger that the pros outweigh the cons of slipping this idea out into the public. In this case, the leaker is already dead, and in fact the leaker would have been killed before anyone else knew WikiLeaks had the emails. So to any potential leakers, this doesn&#39;t tell them that they will be in danger because WikiLeaks is irresponsible with revealing their identity, but rather they are in danger because they are dealing with dangerous people and they need to keep their OpSec in mind at all times. He is saying to the people who are paying attention, &quot;Look, here&#39;s where this story is going eventually, so start looking for the evidence to prove what you now suspect because I am never going to say it outright.&quot; This is about so much more than just the 2016 election or WikiLeaks, this is about trapping these dangerous people in their lies and ultimately exposing the violent criminality in which they are engaged.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do we know that? IIRC, Assange told PBS that Seth Rich was the leak. I&#39;ve seen no evidence whatsoever that Russia hacked the DNC.</p>

<p>This makes sense to me for several reasons.</p>

<p>First of all, Seth Rich was murdered in the street shortly after the leak. Nothing was stolen, and the killers have never been found. He also had the means to be the leak as he worked for the DNC in a position with access to the info leaked. </p>

<p>Second, he was a Bernie fan. Anyone supporting Bernie was outraged when people like Donna Brazile admitted that the DNC rigged the primaries against Bernie. This gives Rich a motive to leak the info.</p>

<p>My third line of reasoning stems from the fact that Clinton&#39;s campaign was shit talking Russia for a long time. Not saying it may not have been warranted, but they have been trying to pin anything and everything on Russia. It felt to me that they were preparing for a possible military escalation once Clinton assumed office.</p>

<p>It makes sense that once the leaks happened, if the DNC gave any credence to the possibility that Seth Rich could of been the leak, they would be obvious suspects in his murderer. Even if they had nothing to do with it, that would look very bad during an election.</p>

<p>Not only would it look bad, but Trump, being the media whore that he is, would never let it down. He would of hammered the theory over and over if it meant winning the presidency. </p>

<p>The DNC and Clinton/Podesta had every motive to put the blame on Russia, which supported their earlier statements about Russian issues they kept pressing in the election, while also pivoting away from any theory that could bring them into the spotlight of not only having a motive to silence Seth Rich, but also giving more attention to the fact that they rigged the Democratic primaries. </p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t they rather create an issue of outside influence on the election, instead of losing face while the public focused on the rigging of the primaries? </p>

<p>Ever since then, the media has been stuck on Russian interference, while the horrendous crime of rigging the primaries has essentially gone unpunished. I have no problem with investigating Russian interference, but I&#39;m beginning to feel that it&#39;s become more of a media distraction to keep the public from holding people accountable for the insanity  of our presidential election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, these are <em>charges</em>, indictments, which does not as you initially suggest mean it passes the scrutiny of a court room. Indictments are notoriously easily for prosecutors to secure, requiring only a prima facie case. So far, Gates has only actually plead guilty to conspiracy against the US (for obstructing the investigation) and lying to the FBI.</p>

<p>Second, Mueller has yet to allege a knowledge or even involvement of these alleged criminal activities of Gates and Manafort to the Trump campaign, let alone conclusively demonstrate it. From the indictments, it appears to be an ongoing money laundering operation that began a decade ago. Even moving around previously laundered money in 2016 could be charged as a crime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, my bad.</p>

<p>I also tend to side with the &quot;more to come&quot; idea. I find that both groups of people that pretend they know how this is going to turn out to be overconfident. That&#39;s part of why I respect Glenn Greenwald&#39;s take on this who thing more than almost anyone. He&#39;s calling and has been calling since the start for an actual investigation, and to wait and see what can actually be proved with evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of us are willing to accept the evidence but just have a really hard time giving shit when it is like, literally one of the least important possible things to talk about right now. So we had one bad election? Better bitch about it for 4 years then vote the incumbent back in. I can&#39;t be fucked to care about Russia&#39;s meddling since half our country can&#39;t be fucked to vote in anything but a general and even more can&#39;t be fucked to care when we do something equally bad or worse to another country. Reap what you sow. If some fucking moron says whataboutism I&#39;m going to lose it. That&#39;s like an alcoholic bitching about the heroin epidemic on Twitter while driving his diesel dually with a .25 BAC. You&#39;re not wrong, but your priorities are fucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly, but it feels to me that Julian Assange chose to bend the rules here since he knew that the potential leakers are already in such danger that the pros outweigh the cons of slipping this idea out into the public. In this case, the leaker is already dead, and in fact the leaker would have been killed before anyone else knew WikiLeaks had the emails. So to any potential leakers, this doesn&#39;t tell them that they will be in danger because WikiLeaks is irresponsible with revealing their identity, but rather they are in danger because they are dealing with dangerous people and they need to keep their OpSec in mind at all times. He is saying to the people who are paying attention, &quot;Look, here&#39;s where this story is going eventually, so start looking for the evidence to prove what you now suspect because I am never going to say it outright.&quot; This is about so much more than just the 2016 election or WikiLeaks, this is about trapping these dangerous people in their lies and ultimately exposing the violent criminality in which they are engaged.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit Enhancement Suite. It&#39;s an API for your PC browser (no mobile version AFAIK), and it&#39;s awesome and I highly recommend you check it out.</p>

<p>One of the perks of it, is that you can tag users with custom color and custom text banners. I mark people that are open minded or just in general capable of having civil and rational discussions of ideas (whether I agree with them or not) with a green tag that has a breif description of why I marked them green. Users that are not here for conversation, and are only here to forum slide, insult those whom disagree with them, or just typical &quot;shill&quot; behavior with a red tag, and a note about what topics they were shilling for. And then I also mark people in orange when I&#39;m not sure if they are shilling, and adjust it later on if I see them doing it repeatedly (because sometimes people just have bad ideas or bad days and become an asshole to anonymous people online).</p>

<p>Once I started doing that, it&#39;s amazing how quickly I was able to recognize that there are many users that are not interested in discussing ideas or talking about conspiracy theories, yet they show up anytime a specific topic is posted in this sub (pizzagate, vaccines, Sandy Hook, Trump/Russia stuff, etc.)</p>

<p>It really makes reddit slightly more tolerable to browse.</p>
