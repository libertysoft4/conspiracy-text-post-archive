<p><del>In January, Dr. Cunningham allegedly told his colleagues and family his fears about this year’s flu shot. Some media outlets have reported he was warned by co-workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that if he kept talking and expressing his opinion he could lose his job or something else could happen. </del></p>

<p><del>Many media outlets have reported that earlier this year he stated, “Some of the patients I’ve administered the flu shot to this year have died, I don’t care who you are, this scares the crap out of me. We have seen people dying across the country of the flu, and one thing nearly all of them have in common is they got the flu shot.”</del></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds like an easy way to twist the circumstances to a far less likely option, but I don&#39;t discount the remarkably small chance he may have done that. </p>

<p>Clearly I&#39;m biased towards not believing YourNewsWire, just as you are biased in believing there is more to this aspect of unverified and unsourced information. I have little doubt there&#39;s something going on with Cunningham beyond what we currently know, but would need to see that specific piece of information sourced from somewhere else to corroborate. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not discounting the source, so much as I am taking it into consideration and awaiting further information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The black mirror bit by his sister is what really piqued my interest. Supposedly she was the last person to speak to him which lead to her going to his home to check on him and adding that he didnt sound like himself. He also tried to reach out to his mother at 5am that same day.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my personal belief that a normally level headed Timothy called his sister to express his concerns for his own safety, say his goodbyes, and ask her to look after his dog. You don&#39;t just draw a correlation to black mirror without suspecting large scale foul play; that&#39;s the basis of every single episode. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit I&#39;ve only watched about ten episodes of Black Mirror, but that&#39;s not the conclusion I made from that quote. I&#39;m not trying to be pedantic or anything, but Black Mirror isn&#39;t always about &quot;large scale foul play&quot;. Most of the episodes I&#39;ve seen were actually very small scale, usually involving the interactions of a single person or small group of people with incredible technology. To me, her quote is just the 2018 version of saying &quot;It&#39;s like something out of the Twilight Zone&quot;. In other words, it&#39;s just a really weird, unexplained situation. I don&#39;t think she was necessarily implying some large scale government conspiracy - though that still is certainly a possibility. I think you are just jumping to that conclusion from that one quote and the third very untrustworthy source you included. </p>

<p>Incredible technology in a society that has gone down a certain path in the adoption of it. The characters usually rebel against it, which consequeqently is a rebellion against society. There’s also a good number of episodes that show how society can turn on the characters not willing to conform to the technological way of life</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He worked w Zika(fake pharma moneygrubbing campaign) and ebola(who the fuck knows what evil tangents that has taken).  The higher ups involved with the Zika mythology all know it&#39;s a scam. Maybe he threatened to talk and was silenced. Pharma seems to be employing hit squads as domestic policy now so nothing would surprise me. That he tried to get his acquaintances to distance themselves from him in his last days shows he was terrified, of somebody.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who&#39;s dealt with this issue, I partially agree. But on the same note, many people also try to do everything they can to get their affairs in order before they pass (writing their will, boxing up all of their belongings, giving away their belongings, finding new homes for their pets, etc) so that their family is less burdened with the process during grieving. I&#39;m sure it happens, but it seems really hard for someone to leave behind their pet the way he did, if we&#39;re to consider the suicide angle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know basically nothing other than the guy has gone missing.</p>

<p>However whats very unusual for me is how for a week now this story keeps showing up in the MSM.</p>

<p>Sounds like some people in powerful positions are very interested in finding this man.</p>

<p>Not sure what that means, it could just be he knows someone of political importance, however that does strike me as very unusual.</p>

<p>I cant even remember the last time a missing blond girl showed up on my Google news feed every day for a whole week.</p>

<li>I have some questions/observations </li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p>A black man isn&#39;t going to go &quot;jogging&quot; without his wallet and cell phone. He was to smart, security conscious Navy Officer.</p></li>
<li><p>No surveillance video of him ANYWHERE? BS. CDC is a federal agency, cameras everywhere.  He &quot;left&quot; through a controlled entrance because they said he clocked out.</p></li>
<li><p>It was raining in that exact area that morning,  who goes &quot;jogging &quot; in the rain?</p></li>
<li><p>Police state he didn&#39;t have access to classified information.  BS. He was a Navy Intelligence officer,  with a top secret clearance. </p></li>
<li><p>Neighbors are highly suspicious.  They do not own the home they live in.</p></li>
<li><p>Police press conference, cop says 3x that he was denied a promotion per the CDC. States 2 x CDC wants to make it clear that his job has nothing to do with his disappearance. Seems very important to CDC, that we buy the narrative. CDC didn&#39;t gave a statement for 30 days after his disappearance and all they said was he wasn&#39;t denied a promotion. Why let that lie go uncontested for so long?</p></li>
<li><p>When people lie they give insignificant fluff. &quot;He was wearing his favorite jogging shoes&quot; how do they know they were his favorite? Why bring the shoes up at all, I think we could all have assumed he was wearing his shoes. The only reason to bring up shoes at all is if he wasn&#39;t wearing shoes</p></li>

<p>People are taking the stupid TV show into the use of this word.  I think Black Mirror means detach, disconnect, delete and from all social circles, relationships and change the pattern.  </p>
