        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://en.crimerussia.com/drugmafia/cocaine-from-argentina-could-be-delivered-by-plane-of-detachment-russia/">https://en.crimerussia.com/drugmafia/cocaine-from-argentina-could-be-delivered-by-plane-of-detachment-russia/</a></p>

<p>Photos and videos attached to the criminal case on the supply of drugs from Argentina to Russia were published on the web. The materials were published by the gendarmerie of Argentina.</p>

<p>The footage shows the image of an airplane in which, presumably, the cocaine in suitcases was loaded. It is noteworthy that the tail number of the liner coincides with the Il-96 number, which belongs to the flight squadron Russia involved in transportation of Russian top officials.</p>

<p>As RBC writes, the airliner with the number 96023, which is visible on the footage, went to the disposal of the Russian Special Forces Flight Squadron Russia of the Presidential Affairs Department in August 2016. This is currently the last IL-96, which replenished the fleet of the flying squad.</p>

<p>At the same time, according to the resource russianplanes.net, on December 6, 2017, the IL-96 aircraft with the onboard number 96023 was at the airport of Buenos Aires. On December 7, it was in Cape Verde, from where it flew to Moscow.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Minister of National Security of Argentina, Patricia Bullrich, stated that it was in December 2017 that the cocaine load was sent “as diplomatic baggage on a Russian government plane.” At the same time, the representative of the Russia squadron denied this information.</p>

<p>It is to be recalled that the British publication The Daily Telegraph earlier wrote that cocaine was sent to Russia on the jet belonging to Nikolay Patrushev, who is the Secretary of the Security Council and was in Buenos Aires for negotiations with the President of Argentina, Mauricio Macri. However, in the Security Council of the Russian Federation this information was refuted.</p>

<p>As part of the investigation of the high-profile case, a technical officer of the Russian embassy named Abyanov and police officer Ivan Bliznyuk have already been detained, and in December the police detained Vladimir Kalmykov and Ishtimir Khudzhamov who came to collect their suitcases from Argentina.</p>

<p>the site (edit - RussianPlanes.net) was completely removed and is now only available in the cache of search engines. A similar inscription appeared on RussianShips website, which is a project of RussianPlanes. The project page in social networks was also deleted. Mediazona contacted the administrator of deleted resources. The owner of the site under the nickname Kiba said that the project is his personal hobby, and the information is automatically compiled from different sites. &quot;I saw the news and decided to delete the site, because we have nothing to do with it. Nobody asked me to do this. I am a little stressed out now, so I just deleted it, I do not want to set anyone up,&quot; Kiba said.</p>

<p>Earlier, RBC reported that the Argentine gendarmerie published in its official Twitter photos of the aircraft, which allegedly participated in a special operation on the controlled supply of cocaine from Argentina to Russia. The images feature airplane number 96023. Using the register of airplanes and flights on russianplanes.net, RBC found out that the tail number of the airliner is the same as the one of Il-96, which belongs to the Rossiya (Russia) flight squadron and is intended for the transportation of the country leaders of the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>Backstory:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/23/400kg-cocaine-seized-russian-embassy-argentina/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/23/400kg-cocaine-seized-russian-embassy-argentina/</a></p>

<p>Police in Argentina have foiled a plot to smuggle cocaine to Europe through the Russian embassy’s diplomatic courier service, following an elaborate sting operation involving a shadowy Moscow intelligence chief.</p>

<p>Five suspected members of the ​drug gang, including a former accountant at the embassy and a Buenos Aires police officer, have been arrested in Argentina and Russia.</p>

<p>And YOU linked the website crimerussia.com which is very much still up.</p>

<p>I also read the Telegraph article yesterday which was almost impossible to follow naming all kinds of names linked to all kinds of other names and hinges on a certain“Señor K” who is apparently very important to the charges, but sadly unidentified and unlocatable as well.</p>
