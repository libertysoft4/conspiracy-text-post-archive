Just watched a video on Global Warming. Some fair points were made but the biggest one which i am struggling to find an answer for is - If global warming is real, do you think the banks and financial industry would give out loans (40yrs example) to low area&#39;s? Area&#39;s prone to flooding? If the sea rises by 10ft for example, a lot of FL would be under water. They said it is the biggest hoax of this century. Got my cogs moving that&#39;s for sure.  </p>

<p>Anyone have any thoughts on this? Just a curious mind working here  </p>

<p>There&#39;s no &#39;&#39;if&#39;&#39;. It&#39;s very real. As a Scandinavian, I&#39;m currently freezing my ass of at work, because the warming has gone so bad that it has caused the polar vortex to <em>split in two</em>, throwing sibirian like temperatures down over northern EU.</p>

<p>I think they (the banks, in regards to your question) will continue to loan freshly printed dollars out to everyone untill the last minute. Just like they continued to serve champagne and brandy on the Titanic, as it went down.</p>

<p>No he didn&#39;t.  He didn&#39;t just say &quot;it&#39;s cold&quot; as you characterized his remark. He said that it was colder because a specific weather system changing and thus pushing cold air to a place where it normally wasn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It always was and always will be out of our control. This planet has gone through hundreds to thousands of climate changes. We are extremely fortunate to be living in a time when it has been warm for such a long period of time. A warming planet means that the human race prospers and populations rise. We are overdue for a cold period. The small amount of carbon humans have put into the atmosphere is a drop in the bucket and the side effect of that is that photosynthesis is increased resulting in more crops, plants, forested areas and receding deserts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for starters, Dr. Peter Duesberg began unraveling the myth by looking at the &quot;scientific&quot; studies.</p>

<p>&quot;In March 1987, Dr. Peter Duesberg, professor of molecular biology at the University of California, Berkeley, and one of the world&#39;s leading experts on retroviruses, a field he helped pioneer, wrote in Cancer Research that he didn&#39;t believe HIV, a retrovirus, caused AIDS. He argued that HIV was too inactive, infected too few cells, and was too difficult to even find in AIDS patients to be responsible. And since the virus is notoriously difficult to isolate, antibody detection became the indicator of infection-something Duesberg protested is highly inconsistent. Antibodies dominant over a virtually unfindable virus has always meant the immune system has triumphed over the invader, not capitulated to it. Finally, there were AIDS cases without any HIV, virus or antibody, further weakening the hypothesis. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) swept those under the carpet by changing the definition of what an AIDS patient is to necessarily include HIV infections. But hundreds of HIV-free, certified AIDS cases surfaced again at the 1992 International Conference on AIDS, and now total over 4,000. This time the CDC changed the name of the disease. Duesberg contends it&#39;s AIDS nonetheless and changing the name only further distracts from the likelihood that HIV doesn&#39;t cause it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you can use that argument any time, correct? So how is your example definitive proof one way or another? Whether you believe he did or not, I highly recommend you watch his press conference as it blows the whole HIV/AIDS deception out of the water.</p>

<p>Here, maybe this study and its findings will be more to your liking:</p>

<p>&quot;The results of the world&#39;s best scientific study that attempted to
measure the efficiency of heterosexual transmission of antibodies to HIV
was conducted by Nancy Padian and her colleagues (Padian NS, et al.
(1997): Heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in
northern California: results from a ten-year study. Am J Epidemiol 146:
350-7).</p>

<p>The most striking result of the ten-year study is that Padian et al.
did not observe any HIV-negative sex partners becoming HIV-positive from
years of unprotected sexual intercourse with their HIV-positive partners.
I repeat—NOT ONE HIV-negative sex partner became positive during the 10-
year study. Therefore, the observed transmission efficiency was ZERO.</p>

<p>However, to avoid reporting a zero efficiency for the sexual
transmission of HIV, Padian and colleagues assumed that the HIV-positive
sex partners in their study must have become positive through sexual
intercourse before entering the study. Using that assumption, they
estimated that an HIV-negative woman would have to have sexual intercourse
1000 times with HIV-positive men before becoming HIV-positive herself.
Even more astounding, HIV-negative men would have to have 8000 sexual
contacts before becoming HIV-positive. Virtually identical figures have
been reported by others (Gisselquist, D., et al., HIV infections in sub-
Saharan Africa not explained by sexual or vertical transmission. Int J STD
AIDS, 2002. 13: p. 657-666; Jacquez, J.A., et al., Role of the primary
infection in epidemics of HIV infection in gay cohorts. J Acquir Immune
Defic Syndr, 1994. 7: p. 1169-1184).</p>

<p>Given these figures and that the Centers for Disease Control
estimates that one million Americans have antibodies to HIV raises an
enormous problem for sexually transmitted HIV. Since there are around 280
million men and women in the USA, that means that on average an HIV-
negative woman would have to have random sexual intercourse 140,000 times
(and a man eight times that number) in order to become HIV-positive
(assuming equal distribution of HIV between the sexes).</p>

<p>Below are additional examples in the literature that neither AIDS nor
HIV is sexually transmitted.</p>

<p>None of the husbands of HIV positive women became antibody positive
to HIV over a three-year period. (Lancet ii: 581 (1985), Stewart et al.}</p>

<p>No transmission of HIV was observed between couples in which all of
the women were HIV positive and in which at least 100 sexual contacts
occurred. (JAMA 259: 3037 (1988), Padian et al.)</p>

<p>After a mean of 3-1/2 years of unprotected intercourse, with an
average of 50 sexual encounters per year, only one hemophiliac wife became
HIV positive. (American Journal of Medicine 85: 472 (1988), Kim et al.)</p>

<p>No transmission of T-cell abnormalities from hemophiliacs with AIDS
to their spouses. (JAMA 251: 1450 (1984), Kreiss et al.)</p>

<p>&quot;The number of American and European heterosexuals who have had
sexual relations with a prostitute, who have no other admitted risk
factors (such as drug abuse), and who have subsequently developed antibody
to HIV can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Sex with a prostitute is
not even listed as a risk category by the American CDC.&quot; (Rethinking AIDS,
Root-Bernstein (1993))</p>

<p>&quot;Non-drug abusing prostitutes have no higher risk of AIDS than other
women.&quot; (AIDS: the second decade, report from the National Academy of
Sciences USA (1990))</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To prove his unorthodox belief that HIV is not the cause of AIDS, a Florida doctor Friday pricked his finger with a needle carrying blood that he said was infected with the virus.</p>

<p>&quot;This is not an act of bravery. This is an act of intelligence,&quot; said Dr. Robert Willner, who practiced medicine in North Miami Beach for 30 years until his license was revoked last March.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not afraid of an innocent virus.&quot;</p>

<p>Before a gathering of about 30 alternative-medicine practitioners and several journalists, Willner stuck a needle in the finger of Andres, 27, a Fort Lauderdale student who says he has tested positive for HIV. Then, wincing, the 65-year-old doctor stuck himself.</p>

<p>Willner, who says he also injected himself with HIV-infected blood in Spain a year ago, claims to be one of many scientists who now reject the theory that HIV causes AIDS.</p>

<p>&quot;There is absolutely nothing to substantiate that AIDS is a contagious disease. You cannot get it from anyone. You cannot give it to anyone,&quot; Willner said.</p>

<p>Most mainstream doctors and scientists reject his ideas, which are similar to those advanced in recent years by Dr. Peter Duesberg, a molecular biologist from the University of California at Berkeley.</p>

<p>&quot;It is absolute nonsense,&quot; said Dr. Charles van der Horst, head of the AIDS clinical trials unit at the UNC-Chapel Hill medical school.</p>

<p>Van der Horst said the theory probably stems partly from &quot;old research&quot; that found that not everyone who had AIDS had detectable virus.</p>

<p>&quot;But that was years ago,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, we can find gobs of virus in everybody (who has AIDS),&quot; he said.</p>

<p>He and other skeptics questioned how anyone can be sure that Willner really exchanged blood with an HIV-infected patient.</p>

<p>To check, The Observer called Andres&#39;s doctor&#39;s office in Fort Lauderdale. A receptionist confirmed that he is a patient and that he is HIV-positive.</p>
