<p>The word amen (/ˌɑːˈmɛn/ or /ˌeɪˈmɛn/) is a declaration of affirmation found in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. ... Common English translations of the word amen include &quot;verily&quot; and &quot;truly&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re thinking of &quot;Amun-Ra&quot;. Very different words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With Osiris, Amun-Ra is the most widely recorded of the Egyptian gods. As the chief deity of the Egyptian Empire, Amun-Ra also came to be worshipped outside Egypt, according to the testimony of ancient Greek historiographers in Libya and Nubia. As Zeus Ammon he came to be identified with Zeus in Greece</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you can rely on phonetics or even the english language script to decipher this one.</p>

<p>In the Ancient egyptian language, and many semitic languages actually, vowels are interchangeable.  AMUN AMIN AMEN AMAN are all similar if not identical.   Which is unnerving.  Furthermore, Amon is the god of &quot;hidden things&quot;  even more unnerving.</p>

<p>So naturally I looked in my bible to see if there are instances of Christ speaking Amen.  Maybe Revelation 3:14 counts?  </p>

<p>I trust the scripture but while I was coming to it, this was one of my biggest stumbling blocks.  </p>

<p>Typically I favor the use of the word &quot;Hosanna&quot; as the translation is much more meaningful to me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The Egyptians, Hebrews and Greeks all had a word for “contentment”. The word for &quot;contentment&quot; is &quot;amum&quot; in Egyptian, &quot;sea&#39;pook&quot; in Hebrew and &quot;autarkeia&quot; in Greek. </p>

<p>What gets interesting is when we compare the Egyptian word &quot;amun&quot; with the Greek word, &quot;amen&quot; (which is the word we often use to conclude our prayers). While the Egyptian word, &quot;amun&quot; means &quot;contentment,&quot; the Greek word, &quot;amen,&quot; means &quot;truly&quot;, &quot;surely&quot;, or &quot;let it be.&quot;</p>

<p>When you ponder this thought, when we conclude our prayers with the word &quot;amen,&quot; we are affirming our faith in the God to Whom we are praying. In essence, we are content that our prayers will surely be heard and answered by God.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The word hosanna (Latin osanna, Greek ὡσαννά, hōsanná) is from Hebrew הושיעה־נא, הושיעה נא hôshia-nā’ which is short for hôšî‘â-nā’ and related to Aramaic אושענא (&#39;ōsha‘nā) meaning &quot;save, rescue, savior&quot;.</p>

<p>In the Hebrew Bible it is used only in verses such as &quot;help&quot; or &quot;save, I pray&quot; (Psalms 118:25).</p>

<p>It is applied in numerous verses of the New Testament including &quot;Hosanna; blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord&quot; (Mark 11.9), &quot;hosanna in the highest&quot; (Mark 11.10); &quot;hosanna to the Son of David&quot; (Matt 21:9). The old interpretation &quot;Save, now!&quot;, based on Psalm 118:25, does not fully explain the occurrence of the word in the Gospels as a shout of jubilation, and this has given rise to complex discussions.</p>

<p>My only hope is that there is a Father in Heaven who is merciful to people like me. And that he knows my heart is in the right place and I&#39;m only trying to avoid giving any worship to his created, yea, only to Him.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is the kind of thing you&#39;re thinking about, and applying to your life, my opinion is that your heart is indeed in the right place.</p>

<p>Something I recall someone saying once, that really made a huge difference in my life, and changed my perspective on what faith is at its core:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you get up in the morning, think about what you can do for God today, ask him how you can best serve <em>him</em>, and to guide you to live as he intends. When you go to bed at night,  think about how you acted today, would your actions and behaviors live up to the example Christ set? If not, think about how you could have handled it better and implement it in your life the next day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By doing this myself, I&#39;ve grown spiritually, learned things and sacked behaviors I never would have otherwise, some things I hadn&#39;t even realized I was doing. </p>

<p>Basically when praying instead of asking for things, I asked to be given what I need to make myself better in his eyes. Really did wonders in my life.</p>

“10Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. 12For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</p>

<p>18And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.”

    <div class="md"><p>I find it fascinating that a lot of people who have commented have said things along the lines of &quot;All magic is dark&quot; or that there is no &quot;good&quot; magic. </p>

<p>The idea that all magic is evil comes from religion and other institutions that run our society. The overlords of the past burnt witches at the stake and snuffed out magic where ever they found it. If you believe the elites practice magic now, it&#39;s only logical that they are following the traditions of past elites. If anything the reason to snuff out magic in the &quot;lower&quot; classes was to take away a weapon or truth that could be used to overthrow the elite. It&#39;s the same reason the US doesn&#39;t want North Korea to have nuclear weapons. </p>

<p>It&#39;s important to know where information comes from and why society thinks a certain way. It&#39;s clear that who ever is pulling the strings wants society as a whole to believe all magic is evil. Just like they want us to believe the official stories about 9/11, pedophile rings, and the deep state.</p>

<p>All this being said, I don&#39;t believe in magic but, that is not what is important. What is important is that the elite believe in magic. The elite preform rituals, go to Bohemian Grove, and attend spirit cooking dinners because they think there is something too it. How this information can be used is beyond me, although the more you know about your enemy the better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is kind of where I stand on the matter too. regardless of the validity of magic, TPTB believe in it and practice it and try to use it for their own benefit. I feel like there is a possibility of being able to influence the world around you (law of attraction and such) and that seems like very lower level magic they introduce to the public to start the indoctrination. </p>

<p>all i know is i am interested in why the elites believe in and practice magic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s safer to practice faith than magic.  You are correct that white magic exists.  The difficulty stems from the fact that magic is powerful, and power corrupts.  Or, more accurately, people often respond to increased power of their own by taking moral shortcuts or even fulfilling base desires, and thereby corrupt themselves.</p>

<p>I would say you&#39;ve thought it halfway through when you write that TPTB &quot;try&quot; to use it for their own benefit.  If it were a waste of time, trying to advance that way would actually select against such a population of misguided magic believers.  But magic believers are not underrepresented as a population among TPTB, on the contrary, the population fraction of magic believers among TPTB seems to be multiplied by a factor of 100.</p>

<p>The most obvious conclusion one can drawn from that observation is that the magic believers are succeeding beyond expectations because belief in magic leads to an increase in power and influence.</p>

<p>Overskeptical pesudorationalists would assert that magic belief remains an insanity, and the power or influence gained due to magic belief is a social phenomenon.</p>

<p>A truly intelligent human would remain open-minded to the idea that magic might be scientifically true.  In that case, the easiest way to figure the situation is to study some white magic and see if it works.  </p>

<p>If you decide to see for yourself, I then recommend the path of Hatha Yoga, not just the third limb, the exercise for the body, but all 8 limbs or degrees.  Then read chapters 3 through 8 of the Gita, and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.  </p>

<p>Another path that is pretty safely white is Falun Gong.</p>

<p>IME, Wicca is too wild and dangerous.  And, as stated in the first sentence, a personal relationship with the living creator God is the best choice for any human, better and easier than white magic.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>where there is evil there should be good</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the world isnt just one entity of ruling people , there are different groups who all worship different &quot;gods or Gods&quot; these &quot;gods&quot; range from Moloch , Baphomet , Ba&#39;al . the &quot;Gods&quot; to them range from Yahweh to Lucifer (Satan) </p>

<p>different groups do different things , one group does it double barrel , the reason for this is the symbol &quot;yin &amp; yang&quot; </p>

<p>to most this symbol presents its self as good and evil or dark and light .. but to them it is a double barrel symbol , <a href="https://image.freepik.com/free-icon/yin-yang-symbol-variant_318-50138.jpg">the symbol its self</a></p>

<p>to spot the difference in &quot;them&quot; and other groups look for the double barrel symbolism </p>

<p>they themselves provide this in their own twisted way . they create a situation that people call &quot;evil&quot; then they provide the &quot;good&quot; , let me explain &quot;their&quot; logic. </p>

<p>they create a situation that calls for action , lets say a military situation in a country .</p>

<p>they then follow up with the &quot;good&quot; by sending in humanitarian aid </p>

<p>from here it looks great , yin and yang .</p>

<p>but..</p>

<p>aid group do some bad things ..</p>

<p>their logic here is to sacrifice the person doing &quot;bad&quot; .. this is them doing &quot;good&quot; once again..</p>

<p>the true meaning of the yin &amp; yang symbol to them has good &amp; evil  , evil and good , the dark side with its small light , and its light side with its small dark </p>

<p>this group worship Lucifer (Satan) , this symbol comes from the <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JuBx5MUx0cQ/hqdefault.jpg">flower of life</a> , the knowledge given to man by the Devil , he is their &quot;god&quot; and he was the defiant rebel Angel who went against God and gave him knowledge that God forbid man to have . to them he is a hero , not an &quot;evil&quot; entity the church would have you  believe .</p>

<p>other groups who use magic and ritual do not follow this double barrel path , they do evil then sacrifice one of their own for the &quot;good&quot; to balance it .</p>

<p>learn to spot them .</p>
