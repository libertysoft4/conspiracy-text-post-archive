        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>*<em>EDIT; *</em>Here is a picture of one of the SUVs I saw on delivery. I couldn’t get a picture of the side,  although it was clearly evident, because I was to afraid to get too close.  <a href="https://imgur.com/a/o7kzV">https://imgur.com/a/o7kzV</a>. This is an unmarked NATC vehicle except for the NATC logo. No plates.</p>

<p>I work in my car, so I am on the road a lot and see quite a bit. </p>

<p>Yesterday, one of our major traffic lights was out, except it was not flashing. It was just red on all sides and the police were running around everywhere. Mostly sheriffs but also local Walnut Creek police also. </p>

<p>As I wait at this light which normally takes a few moments, and I’m sitting there for 20 minutes trying to make a delivery, I look to my right and I see literally 12 cop cars, at least three ambulances and several firetrucks.</p>

<p>I also see people laying all over the sidewalk which is bizarre, and also others sitting there on the curb as if they are stunned. There is a damaged vehicle there, but something just didn’t seem right. Especially since Police seemed to be running around doing fake things.</p>

<p>Well since that time yesterday, on our local website which would usually post a story if the police fart, there is no word of this major horrific accident that looked as if 12 pedestrians had been mowed down. </p>

<p>I didn’t think anything of it until today, when I see there are sheriffs EVERYWHERE. Again, I drive for a living, so I know the difference between end of the month quota and a swarm of cops. Especially when sheriffs are few and far between here. It’s mostly police. But, it doesn’t end there.</p>

<p>Now, today, there are black SUVs driving around like mad. I mean like they can get away with murder. They have lights installed and NO PLATES. I don’t mean government plates or weird plates. NO PLATES, all black, completely black tint, and lights on grill. The only thing on them is a government-looking logo that says NATC. </p>

<p>These SUVs and especially these logos have never been around this area before to my knowledge. I am in a car in the east bay area and in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, nearly 10 to 12 hours a day. I have never seen NATC. I googled it, and it seems to have something to do with the Navy. But these guys are literally driving around like mad even in front of cops burning through lights in and violating just about every rule of the road without any consequence.</p>

<p>I just figured I’d post this here in case any weird shit happens in the next week or so. I see anything else I will edit the post.</p>

<p>As I post this I’m hearing sirens everywhere right now. Anyway I apologize if this is difficult to read, I’m talking into my phone as I’m driving and I will try to edit it better when I get home. If you seen anything weird in the East Bay area by all means please post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What was the Navy be training them in? That’s my question. Especially when it seems they’re just running around crazy running red lights and speeding.</p>

<p>And I shit you not I just got in an elevator at my next delivery and who gets an elevator with me? A sheriff. There’s definitely some kind of weird training or grouping of sheriffs going  on, but these unmarked black vans really make it strange. We might see one or two sheriffs cars a week around this place, and I’m seeing groups of three and four at a time everywhere, and even get into an elevator with one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More likely it&#39;s an Israeli company with a CIA contract to stage terrorism domestically via US-Mexican immigration.  Why do I say that?  Because US law officers are going to Israel for special training, and they&#39;re being required to read books about Hezbollah-sponsored terrorism across the US-Mexican border by Israeli authors.  Here are some of the books I&#39;m talking about: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss/138-1599917-0015132?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=hezbollah+us+mexican+border+terrorism">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss/138-1599917-0015132?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=hezbollah+us+mexican+border+terrorism</a></p>

<p>I first heard about this non-existent terrorism several years ago by people who were required to read this stuff.  It&#39;s been several years since and I keep wondering what&#39;s the pay-off?  When does this operation finally go down?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;NATC Global proactive customer service attitude, coupled with our highly trained staff’s ability to intervene in crimes in progress, is a refreshing change from the traditional security model of “observe and report”. Our paradigm shift from the traditional to the modern, proactive community oriented private patrol operator has proven to be a resounding success with our clients.&quot;</p>

<p>Is it just me or does this sound like private security contractors with the legal authority of a police officer? PMC&#39;s are coming home for some goosestepping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Military contractors and military are used to driving erratically and blowing through stop lights (to avoid attacks/ambush).  There was a recent story between Jocko Willink and Leif Babin (two ex Navy Seals) in which they described blowing through Las Vegas stop lights during a training mission.  Jocko (the commander) didnt tell his men to &quot;go easy&quot;, so they treated the exercise exactly like they would overseas (that is, dont stop at stop lights).</p>

<p>Not sure if that is what it is, but sounds right to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also see people laying all over the sidewalk which is bizarre, and also others sitting there on the curb as if they are stunned. There is a damaged vehicle there, but something just didn’t seem right. Especially since Police seemed to be running around doing fake things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like an emergency/mass casualty simulation. Which explains the next point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well since that time yesterday, on our local website which would usually post a story if the police fart, there is no word of this major horrific accident that looked as if 12 pedestrians had been mowed down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it was a simulation, then there would be no report.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why would they need a damaged car with its undercarriage ripped Sitting there attached to a tow truck. It towed truck which I might add was there from the very beginning and may have totaled the truck there. Because I was at one light and someone I know was it the opposite side at another light stuck there and neither of us ever saw tow truck arrive.</p>
