        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Our media is teaching us (or trying to) that theorizing of any kind involving governments or tragic events is psychotic or mentally unstable. In fact, the opposite it true. The mainstream media is CAUSING mental illness in our populations by teaching us to turn off our intellectual abilities. It causes people to switch off their pattern recognition. The truth is, every human alive should be using their intellect to create theories of the world around us, REGARDLESS of what we&#39;re taught by authority. Now I&#39;m not saying that every theory is always 100% correct. But persons that do not have ANY theories are without a doubt 100% brainwashed. </p>

<p>Most conspiracies boil down to one simple fact — some humans will do anything to keep power, and that power corrupts. We&#39;ve built a world where our societies are BUILT ON conspiracies/lies/coercion/murder/evil. Every human should be a conspiracy theorist, because to not be one is to be is to allow evil to control us.</p>

<p>To reiterate, what we&#39;re being taught is that conspiracy theories = mental instability. Truth is the direct opposite. They are causing metal illness by teaching everyone to accept without question authority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there are forms of philosophy that don&#39;t rely on logic and &quot;relevance&quot; exclusively to make arguments and insights into the human condition. Anglo-American philosophy, for the most part, has it&#39;s foundations in Wittgenstein and truth-value of propositions. It&#39;s useful, but it is only a tool, and has led to a bunch of bad philosophy, like Daniel Dennet&#39;s oeuvre.</p>

<p>I mean, for example, humor is part of our lives and it is completely illogical, but it can make relevant and meaningful points about existence. It can more artfully tear down an argument than the most logically cohesive expressions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I have spent my entire (admittedly not too long yet) life interested in philosophy and never before bumped into the term &quot;Anglo-American philosophy&quot;. I&#39;m still not sure how important your distinction is. The process of learning to be a critical thinker does not require one to work on perfect material - finding faults and learning to have your own thoughts instead of internalizing someone else&#39;s thoughts is the whole point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a split between Anglo-American and Continental schools of philosophy since WWII. It may not be as big of a deal as it was in the 90s when I went to school, since so much of continental philosophy has been denatured and become the basis for things like various forms of critical studies. Basically Anglo-American is interested in truth and truth values, whereas continental is interested in power and structures of power. Again that&#39;s a very basic explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, we should study all the forms of rhetoric and how they are used them to persuade others. Focusing on &quot;relevant and logical&quot; alone is not critical thinking, in fact, it&#39;s a ghetto of thinking, that misses the forest for a particular tree.</p>

<p>Logic is a tool that can&#39;t be applied to most human emotion and feeling, you know, the passions that drive us.</p>

<p>Now if you want to switch that &quot;and&quot; to an &quot;or&quot; your statement would be more open-ended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Those who subscribe to conspiracy theories may create serious risks, including risks of violence, and the existence of such theories raises significant challenges for policy and law. The first challenge is to understand the mechanisms by which conspiracy theories prosper; the second challenge is to understand how such theories might be undermined. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some conspiracy theories create serious risks. They do not merely undermine democratic debate; in extreme cases, they create or fuel violence. If government can dispel such theories, it should do so. One problem is that its efforts might be counterproductive, because efforts to rebut conspiracy theories also legitimate them. We have suggested, however, that government can minimize this effect by rebutting more rather than fewer theories, by enlisting independent groups to supply rebuttals, and by cognitive infiltration designed to break up the crippled epistemology of conspiracyminded groups and informationally isolated social networks.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I find funny is that we’re just supposed to believe the official story with poorly hashed together “evidence” from people that won’t share the bulk of the evidence, but definitely don’t believe any alternate theories.  It comes off very much as “Just trust us”, when they have so much evidence hidden away that could clarify everything.</p>

<p>I totally understand not believing Conspiracy Theories hook line and sinker, but lets just stop suppressing all the information and let the public decide for themselves.</p>

<p>You also have people that struggle to think outside of the boundaries they&#39;ve established for themselves and/or have a limit on their understanding of the world and how it all operates.</p>

<p>Every human being privy to these skills would mean there&#39;s no conspiracy. Not everything under the sun is a deeply entrenched conspiracy.</p>
