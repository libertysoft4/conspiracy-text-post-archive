        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just want to make it clear, first off, that for several reasons, I follow the Philosophy and am a Member of the sub r/mgtow</p>

<p>I find it to be in tune with my buddhist/mystic/gnostic practices, have lived off the grid for a year, have traveled India/Japan/China/Europe Backpacking solo for a year, and I find that my free time, work/investments, hobbies, and silence is more important to me than a relationship/marriage/kids.</p>

<p>2 Notable MGTOW&#39;s of Historical importance, Jesus and Buddha</p>

<p>&quot;Can&#39;t live with them, Can&#39;t live without them.&quot; Certainly I have found myself in this position several times in my life, having been engaged/Almost Married 3 times, opted out of each one, and have had several long term/short term relationships and 1 night stands, at the end of the day, I prefer the solitary free/time life.</p>

<p>What&#39;s Awesome about MGTOW, is that it is consciously aware of cultural and societal programming dynamics when it comes to women. For Example, &quot;Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend,&quot; and having to buy a diamond engagement ring equal to 1/4th of your annual pay, is a Marketing ploy by the DeBeers Diamond Monopoly corporation:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/how-an-ad-campaign-invented-the-diamond-engagement-ring/385376/">https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/how-an-ad-campaign-invented-the-diamond-engagement-ring/385376/</a></p>

<p>So we basically just OPT out of that whole deal voluntarily. </p>

<p>There are other Archetypes within relationships, women&#39;s nature, femininity, and so on, that I have found 100% applicable to every woman I have ever met, including everyone in my family (Sisters, Mother, Aunts, Grandmother), and these are things that are not ever taught to men in school.</p>

<p>We also get attacked, the way r/conspiracy gets attacked as being &quot;tinfoil nutters,&quot; we get attacked as being &quot;involuntary celibates,&quot; incels. All we really want, is to be left alone, and allowed to practice our lifestyle of opting out of &quot;this part of the system&quot; all together.</p>

<p>I 100% agreed, this is one of the reasons of my &quot;opt out.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Certainly I do believe you can find a good match, and that there are some personality types who simply need to be with another. I myself am open to a future Unicorn coming out of the woodwork, however, anyone who does come into my life, is simply an addition and all things are ultimately temporary here.</p>

<p>Having found internal peace, acceptance, and a state of Zen/Awareness, means that I don&#39;t require anything or anyone to complete me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I dont know how you can chose the path you do. I would find it a terribly lonely existence.. but thats a very subjective view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it has to do with internal dynamics, spirituality, personality types, cultural up bringing, horoscope sign (maybe even). </p>

<p>In my teens, it was a must have, but once you get a but older and lust settles down, its really enjoyable to have my house/car paid off and a nice roth IRA</p>

<p>Each to their own. There are many paths to happiness.</p>

<p>Yes, this is vital! And we are attacked for finding happiness in solitude. I am happy that you are happy and support that!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. And in that same vein, Mrs. Crowley runs in that same vein. She means well and she never gets too far away from her core values. She does have a diamond ring and few other pieces, but she knows it&#39;s a scam and has had a moratorium on jewelry for a number of years. There&#39;s no value in it beyond sentimental to her. </p>

<p>We remain fairly independent and after 18-years have little problem giving each other space without judgment or hurt feelings. Sometimes someone will need to focus on a project for a few weeks and will basically need to check out leaving the other a single parent but we&#39;re able to come back together and continue on. I&#39;m fortunate I&#39;m able to get time for myself and I&#39;m fortunate to have someone there when I need them. </p>

<p>The best part is she&#39;s along for the ride. One of our routines is her daily briefing where I run down the non-MSM topics of the day so it&#39;s nice that this stuff is interesting to both of us. In the end, we&#39;re just friends and like hanging out so maybe we&#39;re just lucky?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A very interesting post.</p>

<p>I agree with you that the manipulation of women is intentional and that it was meant to divide men and women.</p>

<p>I went MGTOW because I just can&#39;t get stomach being in any relationship with modern women. </p>

<p>I hate the vapid materialistic culture they are indoctrinated into.</p>

<p>Their hive mentality is disgusting and I am always seen as a pariah for not parroting the politically correct narratives.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t hate women and many MGTOW don&#39;t hate women. They just choose to forgo relationships for personal reasons.</p>

<p>There are some people who hate women in MGTOW but that is a natural part of finding out things are not what they seem to be. We call it the red pill anger phase. It is hard to digest the fact that you have been lied to for years. Soon after many accept the truth and live their lives in peace.</p>

<p>I think people need to stop painting MGTOW as women haters and realize they are a reaction to the modern woman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fully agree with your logic chain. The problem is that this is exactly the intended outcome of the people who started this.</p>

<p>This is no winning strategy but then there might be no win/win possible anymore in our society.</p>

<p>The planned next society will be authoritative and oppressive to a degree most people probably aren&#39;t even considering yet.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that the control of reproduction will be the most important law in that society run based by eugenic principles with DNA engineering/cloning based on what the elites require for their worker drones and need to stay above the rest.</p>

<p>To make that even possible they first need to completely break the social order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both men and women have been manipulated but society punishes men for interacting with women legally to a much greater extent. </p>

<p>Many mgtow including me see no benefits pursuing any relationship with women when there are numerous likely potentially dangerous costs such as a likely divorce after marriage, alimony payments, acquisition of stds due to full blown promiscuity now being celebrated and the threat of false accusations without proof and being tried in a court of public opinion without due process.</p>

<p>They wanted to divide men and women and they have succeeded.</p>

<p>Self preservation is any rational being&#39;s highest priority. I just see no rational benefit in pursuing the romantic relationship route anymore.</p>

<p>I rather relax and do my own thing. I don&#39;t hate women, I just rather not ruin my life for something that have learned to live without.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah came here to mention this. It’s how feminism was used as a “silent weapon” in the “quiet war” against society, especially getting them away from protecting children and making themselves targets of sexism and abuse in the workplace. The family has been compromised in several ways, all members more at risk for abuse, including their partners.  Not saying roles must be written in stone, but the the erosion of a stay at home parent (either one), made the structure much more fragile. So then divorce, which is unquestionably catastrophic for children, becomes much more accepted. Divorce also destroys family wealth and is disproportionately worse for women and children.  Working single mothers are overstretched, children even more stressed and less attended by their parents.  All these child caretakers caught on vid abusing children bec both parents want to be “fulfilled” in their careers. At the end, what did it matter when our children bore the brunt?  It has made men very vulnerable to ridicule and women very vulnerable to believing lies about how critical their role truly is. So men, realize what has happened, that it was a malicious, deliberate attack, and try to heal yourselves and women too. We need to finally see through the propaganda and return to supporting each other and protecting our children. That is your mission, should you choose to accept it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this post, it’s excellent. Raised by traditional parents and a stay-at-home mom, I believe I was fortunate enough not to buy into any of the feminist indoctrination garbage mentioned. </p>

<p>That said, after reading this post, as well as the one above, I can’t help but wonder if both myself <em>and</em> my spouse should have stayed consciously single? We love our children, wouldn’t ever change the fact we have them, but we don’t seem to enjoy being married, not necessarily to each other, but just at all. </p>

<p>At this point it’s simply easier financially and because the kids need a full-time mom to stay together and just try to do our own thing.  We do go out as a family, but not as often as we did when the children were younger. </p>

<p>Is anyone else in this situation? It’s not exactly a “stay together for the kids” situation; I’m not sure we’d go our separate ways when they’re out of the house. I’m not sure what will happen. Input is appreciated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I didn&#39;t have a pregnant nutter gf who was into going offgrid and who cooks so awesome it&#39;s awesome (cooking well is not a Finnish characteristic in my experience) I&#39;d totes recommend MGTOW.  If there was a way to be MGTOW whilst having a gf I&#39;d pretty much be there now.  It&#39;s just easier.  </p>

<p>Let me share my most recent adventure with batshit women as it is somewhat typical of what it&#39;s like where I live.  I&#39;m leaving the pet store with a big bag of kitty litter, dressed in my typical homeless chic style I gots goin on, and a women is coming in thru the only door.  She spots me, holding this hefty bag standing back away from the door to let her in, and then takes her sweet damned time opening the door and coming thru.  I&#39;m not looking at her at all as I tend to not look at women here as it just opens up too many possible avenues for an abusive interaction and I find it just better to leave them alone.  Anyway, after the 10 seconds or so it took her to open a door and walk thru it I look up and she&#39;s giving me eye daggers.  For what?  Absolutely nothing.  It was silly.  This is more or less typical here.  I joke with the gf when we&#39;re out walking the dog on what the over/under is for how many overtly bitchy women we&#39;ll encounter.  It&#39;s that commonplace.  Who needs that noise?  Btw, the whole derelicte fashion style is a fucking great way to make them select to avoid you too.  Works a charm.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting that you take this life philosophy because &#39;women.&#39; It&#39;s possible to have this view on life simply because there is peace and wholeness in being alone, and leaving off of the drama, compromise, difficulty and conflict inherent in committed relationships. I&#39;m a woman and have made that same choice, and it isn&#39;t because, &#39;men.&#39; I was married and dated constantly early in life. I&#39;ve found greater peace in being alone but don&#39;t put it on the other gender necessarily. It&#39;s just a choice.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve found greater peace in being alone but don&#39;t put it on the other gender necessarily. It&#39;s just a choice. I don&#39;t identify with feminists in any way, nor do I give a shit about &#39;things&#39; like diamonds. Not all women are what you believe them to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure not all women are what I believe. For example. I worked on a 6 month job with a crew of Electricians, and one of the, was a woman. She was 6 foot tall, told us dirty jokes every day, and was basically like a man in every way possible (but was married and had kids). She certainly taught all my co-workers about assumptions. I never had any and didn&#39;t judge.</p>

<p>In terms of, &quot;because of women,&quot; my philosophy to be MGTOW is most certainly &quot;because of women.&quot; With my male friends and co-workers, there is a certain unspoken subconscious peaceful and agreeable cohabitation and culture that exists that does not happen amongst women in groups or groups where both genders exist. Certain subconscious elements/dynamics pop up and change everything.</p>

<p>I have literally 100&#39;s of examples from life experience, or you can stop by r/mgtow and see for yourself.</p>

<p>The thing is, I don&#39;t hate women, I just understand women&#39;s nature, ego, the tendency to feelings, how everything goes into chaos during the menstrual cycle hormonal influence of feelings/emotions clouding logic, and so on. I can literally write a book about the difference and so on. Be that as it may, women and men exist, and I simply refuse to give my free time, energy, and attention to any more women, because when I have freed all of that up and used it elsewhere, it has resulted in learning a new trade, learning a new language, learning guitar, starting a new business, staying at an actual monastery for 4 months, and other aspects of my life which give me greater value long term, over a relationship.</p>

<p>You should see Japan, there is a MASSIVE influx of MGTOW over there</p>

<p>There is a sub wich is r/theredpill which breaks down social structures and the psychology of how women operate and why, which I do agree is toxic.</p>

<p>r/mgtow, is more supportive and not as toxic as the other one, because TRP seeks to take advantage of women and objectifies. MGTOW is basically, F-everything and IDGAF everything. They do post links showing how women act, divorce rape articles, sjw articles, and so on, to remind the men there what they are avoiding by living this lifestyle.</p>

<p>There is a ton of that there. The camaraderie reminds the new guys to focus on self improvement, gym, career, healthy life style, hobbies, hiking, traveling, new language, just bettering yourself in the over all best possible way you can. However, in the midst of that, you are going to come across beautiful women and opportunities to get into a relationship, so the sub acts as a reminder of the odds of what can happen when you do </p>

<p>Its a great sub for new guys or post break up guys to learn what&#39;s going on, and to learn about the cultural programming/brainwashing that creates issues within relationships as well as teaching men that, no, you don&#39;t have to be in a relationship and with a woman to be at peace, whole, fulfilled</p>

<p>The meat is in the comments, not necessarily the posts. If someone already had a break up or is questioning the social constructs that exist about &quot;women&quot; and they go there, they will see an aspect of reality that shows the dark side of women&#39;s ego/nature/cultural programming.</p>

<p>The meat is in the comments, where the men there often build each other up and offer advice about focusing on career, finances, house/car being paid off, avoiding debt, being consciously aware of the social/cultural programing, being against the Mainstream media, and a lot of the things that we are all about here in r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>Its merely a stepping stone. Spiritual things are also mentioned there, but take that next step is always for everyone, or often comes later in a man&#39;s development as they mature</p>

<p>All ages, There are older guys who have been divorced raped or gone through 18 years of a cheating wife/ex-wife getting them for child support and other horror stories, relaying their war stories from the front lines to protect the rest of the guys by offering knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What would you say would be the most often cited reason for men choosing this lifestyle?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The relationship, dates, time, energy, attention invested for 10-20 minutes of sex is not worth it</p>

<p>In Japan there is a word for it, &quot;Kenjataimu&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Noun) ( slang) Japanese word meaning : Period of clear thoughts when a man is free from sexual desires after having an orgasm</p>

<p>Translates literally from Kenja 賢者 ( Sage ) and Taimu タイム ( Time )
The only time when a man can think properly is Kenjataimu</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s also risk vs reward. 50% of marriages end up in divorce. When you are starting you career, investing in Roth IRA&#39;s, A House, etc, half of that or much more, can be taken from you in a blink of an eye. This happens to a lot of men after they invest 10-20-30 years into this kind of scenario.</p>

<p>Most of my friends are in the process of getting married, already married, divorced, or have child support payments. They need permission from their wives to do anything, or they are limited with what they can do because they are on strict budgets with Child support.  The only MGTOW&#39;s I personally know is an Uncle who refuses to remarry or date at all, and spends his free time bike riding, VR Gaming, growing Pot, and tending a veggie garden outside of his jewelry business</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do they pretty much align with yours?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah too various degrees. My Uncle says its too risky to be with anyone because of his assets, and that at his age he pretty much has to settle for older milfs with kids or the young ones want money or a visa. </p>

<p>I am sort of on the same page, except that I have random hook ups once a year or so. My free time I travel, hike, live off the grid at a friends acreage when I;m off in the early winter, building a motorcycle, learning to make my own electric car and solar set-up, trying to get a legal dispensary started, and a whole bunch of other projects that I&#39;m busy with</p>

<p>My biggest breakthrough is when I stayed in a Zen Monastery for a few Months in Japan, I had some experiences there with learning to just BE, acceptance, self love, being Okay with everything as it is, seeing lust as a temporary arising the comes and goes, and having some experiences of myself as consciousness which is already whole and complete, sort of like when we were kids (before lust and hormones, when you dont care about girls and still have your playful innocence)</p>

<p>Also, the pull towards sex is just evolution trying to get you to produce more bodies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your reply. I get it but it kinda makes me sad too. I&#39;m somewhat living the same way but I think it&#39;s not necessarily due to bad experiences, but more of a not in a rush whatsoever for the drama that does tend to come from being in a relationship. Just enjoying the me time, doing what I want to do, when I want to. Not having to hassle with the inevitable situations that arise. But I&#39;m not opposed to being in a relationship again. There was a lot of good in having someone to come home to, share experiences with, and rely on. Of course that opens you up, making you vulnerable to getting your heart broken. You noted it was kind of like a risk vs rewards thing. I can wrap my head around that notion. There&#39;s a bit of a gambler in me though. And while I&#39;m very aware that most relationships don&#39;t work out in the long run and even the ones that do aren&#39;t always something folks should strive for, I think there&#39;s something incredibly special about older couples I see in who still look at each other with loving eyes. I know that may seem rare, but trust me, they do exist. I do get it though, not trying to judge. Like I said, you do you.</p>

<p>Yes, r/mgtow shares analytics, biggest visitors are Canada, U.S., Europe, and then elsewhere from there internationally.</p>

<p>What we are seeing now, the refusal to take part in relationships, I believe 100% is part of a many pronged context that has to do with the majority of Alpha males dying in WW2, Cultural Marxism, Western focus on Logic/Reason instead of Eastern focus on Spirit, and a shit ton of other factors.</p>

<p>I can give you an excellent read from a Japanese MGTOW fellow who breaks it down in an excellent manner:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/4gyhf7/japan_and_my_story_as_a_japanese_mgtow/">https://np.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/4gyhf7/japan_and_my_story_as_a_japanese_mgtow/</a></p>

<p>You can skip the first 1/4th of it, and start here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Growing in Japan, I never got the sense of men being appreciated in any masculine role, nor did I see any basic virtue in anything traditional. This was especially true in school when all the popular boys looked like girls, and relatively muscular people like me were considered “scary”. It’s not that I’m muscular compared to white men, it’s just that many of the men have become stick figured weenies since the romance and majesty of the samurai warrior is long gone.</p>

<p>I attribute this to the death of many soldiers who died in combat (aggressive strong men dead) and the post WW2 resolve of the Japanese to become completely submissive to peace (no social acceptance in masculinity), much to the credit of General McArthur whom I deeply respect, and the inherent “drive” that the people possessed which was channeled into the free market, which had only just been made possible by the controlling warlords being removed and executed (emphasis on stuff vs. families).</p>

<p>Same here, great Convo. Also something you would be interested to know about. In Japan, MGTOW are called &quot;Herbivores&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Surveys of single Japanese men conducted in 2010 found that 61% of men in their 20s and 70% of men in their 30s considered themselves to be herbivores.[8] Japan&#39;s government views the phenomenon as one possible cause of the nation&#39;s declining birth rate.</p>

<p>I think this is also evolution saying &quot;STOP&quot; take a break, reconsider everything, and start all over</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been exploring this modern phenomena and actually believe I probably went through (over the last 15 years) a form of therapy that addresses a lot of the MGTOW, latch key kid stuff.  If you want to read more on it from MHO, I wrote polkadotgirl a write up in her thread last night:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8009pl/the_conspiracy_of_loneliness/dus7hwj/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8009pl/the_conspiracy_of_loneliness/dus7hwj/</a></p>

<p>Read her post too.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>TL;DR: modern society post wwii changed radically and in the 60-90 tore up the extended family, moved to the suburbs, got divorced or both parents had to go back to work and isolated massive swaths of kids in the suburbs (latch key kids).  This has left millions of kids missing out on developmental milestones from ages 10-18.</p>

<p>Then they grow up; adult children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I like the idea behind this, and can support that. That said I went to the sub you linked, looked at the top of all time and first words I saw were &#39;next time a slut&#39;. A few more posts and it seems like that place is a very negative sub, not too dissimilar to incels. Perhaps a lot of them just migrated over and started to ruin the integrity of it though, much like many (not all) users who come to this sub from The Donald.</p>

<p>If there were a better place to entertain these ideas I&#39;d like to see it. Not that I&#39;m saying I&#39;d sign up or anything, but it seems like an interesting view point to read into for perspectives&#39; sake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah there&#39;s an element that reminds men of women&#39;s potential nature. These reminders are good to see how female ego gets programmed by Western culture. I think you would enjoy r/zen as well to balance out r/mgtow</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I would buy MGTOW more if two things happened</p>

<p>it didn&#39;t veer into the Redpill stuff which is extremely toxic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a sub wich is r/theredpill which breaks down social structures and the psychology of how women operate and why, which I do agree is toxic.</p>

<p>r/mgtow, is more supportive and not as toxic as the other one, because TRP seeks to take advantage of women and objectifies. MGTOW is basically, F-everything and IDGAF everything. They do post links showing how women act, divorce rape articles, sjw articles, and so on, to remind the men there what they are avoiding by living this lifestyle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when the men do go there own way they vigorously dive into self help, emotional work and explore the ideas of what it means to be a happy person on the inside; what it means to be a healthy man on the inside. Making this stuff about women is the distraction...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a ton of that there. The camaraderie reminds the new guys to focus on self improvement, gym, career, healthy life style, hobbies, hiking, traveling, new language, just bettering yourself in the over all best possible way you can. However, in the midst of that, you are going to come across beautiful women and opportunities to get into a relationship, so the sub acts as a reminder of the odds of what can happen when you do </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Buddhism one of the key tenets is that you never look outside yourself for change or happiness. You always look at what is going on around you and if it sucks you look inward to change it; you always focus on the self.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, agreed</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the last 15 years I&#39;ve been going through a lot of awesome modern therapy for just these same issues. I started out interested in redpill and mgtow but as luck would have it, also found a really new and extremely effect therapy strategy for fixing what a lot of us internet dudes have. There is a really common modern phenomena of isolation, latch key existence, missing male rolemodels and missing developmental stages from the ages of 10-18.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also agreed</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, I hope you find what you seek but please use the MGTOW time wisely as it can be a glorious self jounrey to healthy being.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its a great sub for new guys or post break up guys to learn what&#39;s going on, and to learn about the cultural programming/brainwashing that creates issues within relationships as well as teaching men that, no, you don&#39;t have to be in a relationship and with a woman to be at peace, whole, fulfilled</p>
