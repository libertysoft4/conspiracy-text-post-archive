<p>Been listening to Alex on and off for years, and I still don&#39;t know if he&#39;s legit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No offense but if you have been listening to Alec for years you should have come to the realization that he has been compromised for many years and most likely Cointelpro from the very beginning.  All you have to do is listen to him fake cry on 9/11 and also the video of him trying to take over a peaceful 2nd amendment rally with his bullhorn.  Those are two of about 2000 examples you could point out.   </p>

<p>Alex is by design the &quot;conspiracy archetype&quot; that the  mainstream media must put &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; into a box with.  That way they can control any conspiracy narrative they want by having Alex interview/debate people and the  mainstream public will think that Alex speaks for ever &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.  So when Alex goes on a crazy screaming rant it makes everyone that questions the official story seem crazy.</p>

You can listen to his Y2K meltdown and realize he was controlled all the way back then and probably before.

That is what his main job has been for at least the last 20 years, tell some truth but always poison the well at the end.  </p>

They want to disprove the Bible and make us feel powerless when in fact we are powerful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it makes sense.  There is no way in the world Alex would still be alive if &quot;the powers that be&quot; didn&#39;t want him saying everything that he has been saying for the last 20 years.  So for that very reason Alex has to at least pretend they are trying to suppress him.  Also he isn&#39;t even banned from youtube.  Supposedly they gave him a &quot;warning&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its weird but the thing that always seemed off about him was not what he said but how he said it.  The way he screams and rants about topics, and then he takes a deep breath and is calm as can be.  When he&#39;s yelling and his face turns red and the veins pop out of his neck, its clearly an act.  He&#39;s not the least bit frustrated or angry.  Michael Savage and Mark Levin are two others who do the EXACT same thing.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, one thing they all have in common is that none of them will ever criticize Israel for anything, which especially makes no sense in regards to Alex Jones, a so called conspiracy radio host, being that Israel was clearly behind 9/11.  If that radio silence isn&#39;t proof that Alex Jones is CIA/MOSSAD/deep state, then I don&#39;t know what is.  </p>

<p>Respectfully that comment makes no sense.  Because he is compromised and planted is the reason he has so much influence.   </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just more evidence that he is controlled.  For years he was preaching against the &quot;left right paradigm&quot;  and then he started openly supporting the republican party and Trump.  Obviously they are trying to tie the two archetypes together (Trump and Jones).  It is just like WWE wrestling.    </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is just a perk he gets for the social engineering role he has played for years.  I&#39;m sorry but if you don&#39;t think that Alex has intelligent agency ties you haven&#39;t done very much research on the subject (again he openly admitted that half of his family is CIA).  He has been publicly busted hiring interns and employees from Stratfor intelligence agency.  He has been &quot;outing&quot; the &quot;elite&quot; for over 20 years and they just let him??  Trust me if you research the subject in depth there is no way to believe that he is not a controlled asset, it&#39;s very obvious.      </p>

<p>Because he is compromised...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that is giving the hundreds of millions of people on the Internet way too much credit. The fact that there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people who legitimately praise Alex Jones is not some unbelievable circumstance. When I say &quot;influence,&quot; I&#39;m not referring to just political or economic. I&#39;m referring to his social influence. Like many large YouTube channels, he has possibly millions of followers devoted to him. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>openly supporting the republican party and Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that&#39;s  because people like Trump obviously would validate Jone&#39;s movement. This would inevitably attract more Conservative followers and increase his base. I think that&#39;s what it was that finally made him big enough to fit into the mainstream spotlight. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/bBMXmjVr954?t=73">https://youtu.be/bBMXmjVr954?t=73</a></p>

<p>I think we can both agree that Alex Jones is full of sh*t. He will say whatever he needs to say to try to prove a point.  That&#39;s how he debates and that&#39;s how he&#39;s become so successful at it. He throws in lies and fake sources that make debating him impossible if you presume they are true.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what he did in that interview, and that&#39;s what he does with his audience. Constantly lie and abuse their blind faith. He&#39;s basically just a modern cult leader.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that, I&#39;ve been intimately familiar with ivies. But the better metric would be looking at need-based financial aid percentage only. Merit based scholarships skew towards wealthier/privileged students---better teachers, better classes, better curriculum, tutors, etc are available if you have a wealthier background so it makes sense. Prove me wrong.</p>

<p>Moreover, student loans also count as &quot;financial aid&quot;. Combining all these types of aids dilutes the reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its just a theory but to me it makes sense. The kid is 18 years old, made it through 11.5 years of school and is just “not going back”. Look at his ideas, the way he talks, the way he spells and forms sentences, this kid wont survive without an education. Plus, he really thinks that him not going back to high school is going to make the government take away the rights of US citizens? The whole “not going back” is just part of the plan to keep anyone from tracking him down and sort of washing his name. Its basically just destroying evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that seems ridiculous.  Word would spread around the school like wildfire if he didn&#39;t go there.

    <div class="md"><p>There were so many people in my highschool, there could easily be hundreds of kids I have never seen before. Maybe he&#39;s just a kid everyone assumes they just didn&#39;t know. He&#39;s unassuming, easily blends in. Could be anyone. If he did go, could he be planted? He only was supposed to have attended for a couple of months. </p>

<p>His history is fishy. I read an article that he was in another city on the news just a couple months beforehand. But no, that&#39;s not fishy, because he lived there then. But officially, really he was on vacation there. In the same article. So which is it? He lived there at the time or was in vacation?</p>

<p>Not to mention, students, real ones, are traumatized. Maybe they&#39;ve been told, &quot;hey we&#39;re going to out in a stand in to respresentatives you all to save you all the stress and trouble of the media&quot;</p>

<p>Who knows.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been a conspiracy theorist when it comes to bombings or shootings, but the Vegas one didn&#39;t quite sit right with me and this one is <em>way</em> rotten.</p>

<p>Why was there a police officer&#39;s kid with a bullet proof vest at school? Why did a student insist there were two shooters, bc she heard shooting and saw the perpetrator at the same (ish) time? How can you SHOOT UP A CROWD and then blend in?! Nah fam.  Why did a teacher see a shooter in full riot gear? Did anyone find it? Ever? Where&#39;s the gear?? That would&#39;ve have been ,easily, a great photo op for <em>some</em> news outlet, if the shooter DID indeed lose it before scattering. Why did he show up in an Uber? REALLY- NOONE has interviewed this Uber driver yet? For real?! </p>

<p>This shit is fucking fishy and it&#39;s crazy that very few people see it. On top of the Vegas shooting where people, in real time on social media, said there was multiple shooters, exists we&#39;re blocked and they didn&#39;t know why media was hiding it. Wonder what happened to those people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think thats what makes it more believable. Kids at that age are typically dickheads. My problem with it, is that there are &quot;graduation&quot; pictures from 2014. Meaning grade nine =2014-2015. Grade 10=2015-2016. Grade 11 =2016-2017 grade 12 = 2017-2018. He&#39;s supposedly grade 11, 17 years old, looking the same now, as he did in the graduation pictures from 2014. 13-17 are some pretty major years for hormones and facial structure development, meaning he would not look exactly the same, even though he somehow does. This is why i believe the 22 year old crisis actor stance; he -COULD- look the same at 18 and 22, which is a lot more likely than looking the same across 4 years in the peak of puberty</p>

<p>This seems like a cover-up for the fact that he doesn&#39;t want to graduate from the school on his record, knowing his future will entail background checking, college applications, etc. He will work for CNN without graduating from high school with the shooting as his excuse for not wanting to complete his degree. He wasn&#39;t even in the same building as Cruz...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a crisis actor or something ridiculous like that, but one of his reddit posts was an emotional condemnation of the college process, specifically about having mediocre test scores that invalidated everything else he did. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if part of jumping for these media opportunities/political grandstanding is to better his chances for getting into a top college. And, honestly, I can&#39;t blame him (or that bald headed histrionic girl) for wanting to do so. It&#39;s only human.</p>
