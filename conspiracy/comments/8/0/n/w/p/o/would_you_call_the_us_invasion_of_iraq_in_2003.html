<p>The Bush admin knew the intel was very faulty, knew that certain people had cherry picked pieces of intel to make their case, and yet still did it.  Many people within the admin knew that the case for going into Iraq was just not there.  But they wanted to go for other reasons that no one wanted to admit.  And so they just let it all happen.  </p>

<p>What do you all think?</p>

<p>They wanted a war and they got one. </p>

<p>When one factors in the blood and treasure this war cost us, to say nothing of the Iraqis it killed, the fraud behind the Iraq war should be the biggest scandal in the history of US politics, dwarfing Teapot Dome, Watergate, the Grant Administration, but instead there is nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. They got a man, an Iranian nuclear scientist Codename Curveball, to attest to working in a facility in Iraq that worked with weapons grade nuclear material. He detailed the deliveries into the facility, noting structures that had been altered a few years prior. It was fabricated, start to finish, save for his background as a scientist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. </p>

<p>But here&#39;s the thing conspiracy theorists should take note: millions of people were against the Iraq war from the beginning, especially in the UK, where it basically damaged Tony Blair&#39;s political career. The masses are not always blind.</p>

<p>It never made sense to link Iraq to 911, except to play on the xenophobic fear of some in the US against all Muslims after 911, this fear continues today and is most prominent in the alt-right movement. Think about that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of fear - it wasn&#39;t simply that &quot;xenophobic&quot; fear of muslim extremists capable of blowing up skyscrapers. There was another fear. </p>

<p>The fear I am talking about is hard to describe, but everybody knows the children&#39;s story of &quot;The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&quot;. What kept the entire population from seeing the nakedness of the Emperor? </p>

<p>In the story, only that one child was not afraid, so he said it. He was too innocent to know the danger, the guardedness, the strangeness, the disbelief, the horrible doubt people felt after that event. </p>

<p>Every &quot;grown up&quot; newscaster, politician, general, celebrity, and athlete drank the koolaid, and turned around and handed the cup to us. If you were the one that doubted, there was fear. If you were there that day, that week, those first two years, can you reach back and feel it any more? </p>

<p>It&#39;s taken nearly two terrible decades for that fear to turn completely to rage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to be rude but I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>Even immediately after 911, there were plenty of people keeping a cool head and opposed bombing Afghanistan or engaging in a war there.</p>

<p>The media, then and now, was only interested in feeding whatever latest hype.</p>

<p>If you were part of the protest movement against the Iraq war, you would know the rage started from the beginning when those protests were essentially ignored by the people in power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The playbook for the iraq invasion was drafted up by PNAC years before it happened.  Also think about how they had a 16,000+ page document ready to be signed almost immediately after 9/11. The patriot act was fast tracked and had been written far before the attacks.  Not to mention Urban Moving Systems, dancing israelis, who owned the HVAC company doing work in the towers months leading up to the attack, lucky Larry Silverstein and fam, purchase of the twin towers in June 2001 from the NY Port Authority, double insurance taken out on towers by lucky Larry in the rare event of terrorists attack, the 45 degree angle melted steel cuts of the support columns at ground zero, rumsfeld declaring 2.1 trillion missing on 9.10.2001 and the missl..i mean plane that hit the pentagon just happened to destroy the part of the pentagon that held the files to investigate the trillions missing and killed 41 of the 42 internal auditors working on the missing trillions, building 7, bbc reporting attacks 20 minutes ahead of the actual first plane hitting the towers, the sweetheart deep state relationship of israel, Saudi Arabia, and the US still going strong today, the billions made by haliburton for not just weapons manufacturing but also supplying airports with body scanners, all materials from fallen builiding being shipped and destroyed asap by guilianni without even 1 meep about maybe we should investigate the crime scene, whats up with the inverted black cube fountain memorial and the oculus building outside freedom tower......etc etc.. Anyways theres absolutely no conspiracy here at all, random evil sand people made 3 buildings collapse into their own footprint with 2 planes that day in NY, how do we know well the MSM said it was bin laden 45 minutes after 1st tower collapse and a hijackers passport from inside the plane literally in the heart of the jet fuel explosion thankfully somehow floated from on high into the FBIs hands so we can know for sure no conspiracy is involved and it was evil sand people. Now be still little one and remember: &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; &quot;We Got Him&quot; &quot;Go Shopping&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the UK ambassador to the US at the time, Christopher Meyer, in his 2005 book, <em>DC Confidential</em>, Henry Kissinger gave a &quot;powerful and convincing presentation&quot; justifying the invasion of Iraq during his annual speech at Bohemian Grove in July 2002.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was the beginning, he said, of a new era in international relations. It marked the end of a period inaugurated by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. One of the treaty&#39;s principles was the sanctity of national sovereignty: on this basis the modern nation-state had come into being. Now, in certain circumstances, continued Kissinger, action violating a national frontier could be justified. But he set out three conditions: Military action must be brought to a rapid and successful conclusion; the US had to get the diplomacy right; and it had to arrive in Baghdad with a clear plan for the succession to Saddam. In the event, none of Kissinger&#39;s conditions was met.  </p>
