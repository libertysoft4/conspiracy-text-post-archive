<p>Did they get specific orders to stop spamming? If so, how come - have the funds been redirected?</p>

<p>One theory might be that they are fueling the hoax conspiracy, making every normie in the world hate on conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Much like the flat earth theory - injected purposefully as a strawman for the common folks - to make us all look like fools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, my my think there’s a few groups who would either be paid or in here in bad faith, intentionally obfuscating the situation.</p>

<p>Gun sales go up whenever there’s a public panic about “gun grabbing.” Pushing a narrative of “this didn’t happen, don’t reflect on our gun problem, but hurry up and buy a gun” would be in their interests. Gun sales have been down, after all.</p>

<p>Trump supporters immediately attempting to muddy the waters because the shooter was on “their” team. I’m talking about the people who push that the shooter was antifa, a Muslim, etc before the news of the day is even done, and push it hard. The Pulse shooting, for instance, didn’t get treated remotely the same way. </p>

<p>Foreign governments looking to sow discord in the public. </p>

<p>There’s probably a few more, I’ll edit while I think this one through :) haven’t even finished my first cup of coffee yet.</p>

<p>Seriously, I don&#39;t track gun sales. I&#39;m not influenced by the NRA. I&#39;m not the slightest bit politically influenced when scouring through video and print looking for idiosyncrasies. </p>

<p>I will say, however, that I&#39;m seeing a push from several different political movements to co-op the event to make it political and I do jump in to preserve my 2nd amendment as a citizen. I value it. No one has to pay me for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, come on. It&#39;s too early for fallacies, man. 
I didn&#39;t say that everyone who disagrees with me was a shill, nor that <em>everyone</em> who sees FF or gun grab is a shill, nor that <em>you</em> were a shill - you asked why people would be paid/shilling to promote false flag/hoax, and I answered.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a skeptic but fail to be skeptical of your own side, even of yourself and conclusions you&#39;ve made, I&#39;d say that&#39;s a bit of a shame. </p>

<p>You&#39;re on a side, man. It&#39;s why you took what I said about NRA shills personally and felt the need to defend yourself (which is totally fine) when I was just making general statements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And here we go again. What makes you think I took what you said about the NRA &quot;personally&quot;? What I take personally is the way you label people into your pre supposed groups. Are you saying that supporting the Constitution is &quot;taking a side&quot;? </p>

<p>And you didn&#39;t answer to the &quot;conclusion&quot; part of your previous comment. If anything, you have come to some conclusions that are fairly off base. It seems awfully arrogant of you to make so many assumptions about what I think and what I take &quot;personally&quot; and come to conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man - you&#39;re really looking for a fight here, Grace, and I&#39;m not remotely accusing you of anything or attacking you.</p>

<p>I got to your comment within seconds of you posting it, and it didn&#39;t say anything about conclusions. It ended with &quot;What side?&quot; </p>

<p>You literally started your comment with &quot;not everyone who disagrees with you is a shill,&quot; then went into it about why you personally feel the need to jump in and defend the second amendment. I&#39;m not sure how you can now say you didn&#39;t take it personally and decide to defend yourself (which, again, is totally fine!), even though I wasn&#39;t speaking about you. </p>

<p>Yes, supporting the constitution is definitely taking a side. For instance, I personally think the constitution is shit and just some stupid document written by slave-owning elites. We would be on opposite sides of that conversation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>true but after being on this sub for a while thats all everyone uses to discredit conspiracies, not reptiles, hollow earth, alien etc, its weird how anti flat earth a conspiracy sub can be without doing any of the research, and most will say its dumb so why should i research it ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of people have looked at the evidence, and come to the conclusion that the earth is indeed round. I think it&#39;s fine that people like to entertain unlikely ideas (don&#39;t get me started on my love for Bigfoot, for instance), but it&#39;s pretty easy to see why that&#39;s an idea that would get mocked - even among a community of skeptics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your point, and at first thats exactly what i believed about the flat earth. What i did was instead i tried to prove it wasnt flat which i couldnt prove which got me looking at it deeper, i went deeper and checked if we did go to the moon, why we can&#39;t go to the poles unguided and all sorts of things. Im not saying for this sub to believe but every post is about how flat earth is for shills or a psy-op really shows most people not all never make it past the statement &quot;the earth is flat&quot; they dont comprehend how and just dismiss it as something the media uses to label us crazies. </p>
