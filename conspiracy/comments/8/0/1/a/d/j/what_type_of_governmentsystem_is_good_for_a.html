<p>Why? It&#39;s a business that provides a service like any other. They have to pay to keep your money &quot;safe&quot; via the physical building, website (and other online infrastructure), taxes, utilities, employees, security contractors, etc etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, that&#39;s not what a banking business actually is. A bank is to keep your money (that you acquired generally speaking via transacting <em>in business</em>) &quot;safe&quot; and to loan out money. It&#39;s a service in which they should be compensated for, if you choose to do business with them. You&#39;re wrongfully conflating a local credit union with the likes of the Federal Reserve. Which should be abolished, imo. </p>

<p>I never said keeping your money safe was the only way they made money. I said they provide various services, including what you said there (loans).</p>

<p>WTF, does this have to do with banks or my comment about a banking business? You&#39;re conflating, once again. Your real beef is (or should be) with fiat currency via the Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve Notes), not banks in general.</p>

<p>Exactly, the problem is fiat currency, not banks. You&#39;re going to need a bank just as well, if you have gold you want protecting.</p>

<p>Book stores should be privatized, banks should be nationalized. </p>

<p>In what world does that even make a lick of sense?</p>

<p>Quite simply in this context here? Marxism/Socialism, via central economic planning (The FED) and fiat currency. There are many other societal things, as well though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A mixed economy similar to the European social democracies with a strong social safety net would be ideal. </p>

<p>There needs to be a degree of capitalism to incentivize progress in technology and civilization, but it should be tempered as we do live on a planet with finite resources. </p>

<p>Just my opinion. I think we are too advanced to have people living on the street while others hoard immense wealth in private banks. Wealth inequality is to be expected in such a system, but it doesn&#39;t have to be runaway capitalism where CEOs are making <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/20/ceos-make-271-times-the-pay-of-most-workers.html">270 times</a> the amount of the employees. Less than 60 years ago, the pay gap was 20 to 1 between CEOs and employees. Something along those lines seems far more fair to all of society.</p>

I guess that’s socialism huh? Can’t lie though the ancients had it right, some people hunted for everyone, some people farmed for everyone, some people made clothes and pottery, and some people taught and took care of the children , some cooked the food, some did spiritual work or healing and everyone shared the burden and they all worked together and helped each other live harmoniously, and it worked, and they survived until the brutal men with their Christian ideals came and slaughtered them all and their peaceful way of life :) </p>
