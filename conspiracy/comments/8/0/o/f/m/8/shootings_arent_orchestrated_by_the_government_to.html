    <div class="md"><p>I realize and state that. </p>

<p>Modern day NRA is far more about lobbying and influence from gun manufacturers.  I think this change occurred around 1975 when Harlon Carter founded its lobbying wing.  Lately they sure have been pushing a lot of divisiveness in their videos as well.  I don&#39;t support them and wouldn&#39;t put them past them to help their manufacturers.</p>

<p>Probably not as someone would just go buy a truck or van. Doesn&#39;t seem like a good comparison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NRA is pushing divisiveness? Have you seen the people calling for the death of a segment of the population? A good chunk of that segment is getting fed up. The NRA is stepping up its efforts because its members are pissed. AARP would have done the same thing if the calls for not allowing seniors to vote had been taken seriously.</p>

<p>When I lived in California, they started throwing around the idea of banning the sale of Luxury SUVs. As soon as that happened, they went flying off the dealer lots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No...you all have it wrong.  The school shootings are orchestrated by flag pole manufacturers.  If the US flag keeps getting lowered each time we have a school shooting then the rope&#39;s little pulley wheel at the top of the flagpole will wear out and need to be replaced.  If they do enough school shootings then they will make more cash from the pulley wheel replacements...how much clearer does it have to be?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it is symbiotic, isn&#39;t it? They do care because, otherwise, they would be out of business, not to mention that I&#39;m certain their actual <em>people</em> do honestly care about the 2nd. On the other side is their citizens that value their 2nd amendment. Why would they not welcome the backing of the manufacturers of the product that represents their inalienable right? </p>

<p>And gun manufacturing is a legitimate industry, however distasteful you find it. It is manufacturing of a legal and durable good. </p>

<p>As for the whole association, no doubt there is shady business and manipulation- not unlike any other lobby group. I mean, the American Bottling Association (aka Coca Cola) backed Michelle Obama&#39;s school food program. And please don&#39;t take that as &quot;Whataboutism&quot;. It isn&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>The expansion of that right in directions where it should or does not apply.</p>

<p>Kinda hard to think the constitution meant you should have a weapon capable of killing dozens per minute when they didn’t exist at its drafting.</p>

<p>A number of courts also agree. The right to bear arms doesn’t mean you can or should own any type of firearm you can get your hands on. </p>

<p>How does arming teachers change your inalienable rights? It’s doesn’t but arming 10% of public school teachers with the basic version of a glock would cost over $700 million. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The writers of the constitution wanted its citizens to be able to protect itself from a rogue leader and his military. When it was written, the state of the art weapon was a single shot, muzzle loading, black powder rifle. Everyone had the same weapons the soldiers had. If 2nd amendment rights were upheld as our fore fathers had intended, we would all have the ability to own Abraham’s tanks, F16’s, surface to air missiles, etc.  I’m not advocating for this obviously, just pointing out you have no basis for your argument other than what the Supreme Court has eroded away.

    <div class="md"><p>You do need to study more. You pointed out that owning firearms that could kill many people at a time was not our fore fathers intentions. Our fore fathers I’m sure couldn’t even grasp that war would become me as horrific as it is.  It was their intention however to allow its citizenry to not be controlled or subjected by a supreme military force. It was intended to ensure that rule was for the people by the people not subjugation.  I’m not sure where you got confused as it doesn’t seem like a leap of logic, but when written the military did not have supreme firepower. Even the most outrageous assault rifle available without special permits and ridiculous expense, does not remotely compare to the weaponry the average infantrymen carries today. In addition, I will venture to guess you have no concept of what an assault rifle truly is, how it functions, and what its capabilities actually are. I say again, Study more talk less. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, the NRA is responsible for multiple calls, tips and home checks on the shooter that went unheeded by the FBI, local sheriffs and Social Services <em>including the shooter calling 911 himself to say he was unstable</em>?</p>

<p>Wow. With that much power, why don&#39;t they just make gun purchases mandatory? Sounds a lot easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t some guy go on CNN and say Donald Trump did not want to go to war with the FBI? The same FBI that has overlooked and ignored signs, messages and tips on all massive shootings and attacks? To say they didn&#39;t orchestrate could be true but letting them slip by in areas like Broward County whose Sheriff department is up to their ears in shady tactics sure is convenient.  Not to mention NRA is a big contributor to Trump, MSM came out screaming gun control while the victims were still warm is very interesting.  Blaming the NRA is just down right stupid.  Do you blame Joint Pathology Center for every bad hip replacement or the doctor? You blame the doctor.</p>
