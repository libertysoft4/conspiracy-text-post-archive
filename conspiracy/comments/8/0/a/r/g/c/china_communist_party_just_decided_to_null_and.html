<p>I&#39;m guessing they are going to claim that the risk of Russia interfering in an election is too risky at this point.</p>

<p>So...what the hell. Let&#39;s just keep Xi in power indefinitely...</p>

<p>China continues to set the bar in how to truly establish a dictator-run surveillance state that aligns with the globalists NWO agenda...let&#39;s give them all a round of applause.</p>

<p>Edit: Well, that didn&#39;t take long. China pushes back against criticism of keeping Xi in power. Including removing posts on social media.</p>

<p><a href="https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1GA040">https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1GA040</a></p>

<p>Now, the real question is...just how critical will the media be? Will they find a way to spin this as being necessary for &quot;global stability&quot;?</p>

Let&#39;s just say, we (US/West) are not propping up Israel, and dominating the Middle East because of Oil, or &quot;Jewish&quot; power over the US/West. There is far more to it, than that. The HRE is constantly making moves, and is working with the EOC and Islam (a creation of the HRE).

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The Constitution now limits Mr. Xi, who became president in 2013, to two terms in that office, amounting to 10 years. But the party leadership has proposed removing the line that says the president and vice president “shall serve no more than two consecutive terms,” Xinhua, the official news agency, reported on Sunday.</p>

<p>By moving so early in his tenure, Mr. Xi, 64, is in effect proclaiming that he intends to stay in office well past 2023, overturning rules of succession in Chinese politics that evolved as the party sought stability following the power struggles to replace first Mao, and then Deng Xiaoping.</p>

<p>“Xi Jinping will certainly continue,” said Zhang Ming, a retired historian at Renmin University in Beijing. “In China, he can do what he wants to do, and this is just sending a clearer signal of that.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have many questions.</p>

<p>One, is stability in China perceived as so tenuous that the CCP backs this move because they think that the near future is too unpredictable to risk a change in leadership?</p>

<p>Is it possible that corruption, the economy, the environment, etc, are running out of control in China to the point that this isn&#39;t just a potentially &quot;good idea&quot; to CCP leaders but an almost necessary step to keep a lid on everything and prevent some kind of internal crisis?  I know a lot of people with insight into the Chinese economy seem to make some scary predictions and see the economy as something of a house of cards.</p>

<p>Is this just a predictable power play by a Chinese leader who sees a chance to strike while the iron is hot?  Grab more power while you have enough power to grab more?  I feel like Xi really isn&#39;t the type of megalomaniac type leader who just wants to establish a cult of personality.</p>

<p>Other articles I&#39;ve read in the past about changes in Chinese leadership seemed to indicate the 2-term rule was considered very important to long-term political stability and that CCP really wanted to avoid the kind of power struggles that would naturally occur when a long-term strongman died or the risk of a new &quot;gang of four&quot; type situation as a leader aged and their circle attempted to usurp power for themselves.</p>

<p>The rationality of this kind of policy makes perfect sense, especially from a party-first kind of perspective.  I can only guess that party leaders must actually see pretty grave internal problems to risk a future power struggle/power vacuum arising when Xi dies.</p>

<li><p>Stability is perceived as above anything else by CCP, but a change in leadership was considered as not against but for stability by the 2nd generation of dictators of CCP ( Deng&#39;s team). Xi may or may not have a different idea.</p></li>
<li><p>Very true. Since 10 years ago, within the power elites of China, there is a self joke of they are all playing a &quot;Russian roulette” game, meaning the elites had no idea what to do to overcome the numerous crisis. Seems like Xi has his idea now which is further power consolidation.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, very likely. The meeting to discuss Consititution editing was supposed to happen next month, XI made a surprise move of having it done early.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Like I said in my other post, most Chinese believes its Xi&#39;s personal ambition of returning to Mao&#39;s time has led him to this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I started college in 2014, and was introtuced to communism (I knew about it before) and was so happy that China was the player to stand against the NWO. 
I mean, communism by itself is not the problem, but once you understand that Marx created it to subjugate the working class, not to empower it against the satanic cabal that push the NWO agenda, It became my modo to go further and further in my path to adquire as much knwoledge I can.</p>

<p>Just to contextualize, I&#39;m from South America, and here the &quot;left&quot; (I do not believe in the left right paradigm anymore) was and is the only ones that &quot;fight&quot; against the imperialism, even tough they do not seem to correlate the americam imperialism, with the NWO cabal that infiltrated US. The 2016 coup in Brazil, was perpetrated by an faction inside the federal governemt (The right in Brazil is composed mainly by CIA assets, and sold out crocks) the &quot;face&quot; against corruption is a freaking judge designed to destroy a whole sector of the industry and an midia outlet that has always served the NWO agenda... Imagine if CNN was THE ONLY channel in US, that is what Rede Globo is here, but its reach is WAY bigger (at leats 50% of the population watch it EVERY DAY). What I wanted to argue, is that here at least the &quot;right&quot; is the ones pushing the agenda, and the left are (where, because even in the left there is many assets) fought against it. Communism is not the goal, it is a tool, that can be used (and is) by the satanist to control, but also is capitalism! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I understand, communism doesn&#39;t exist and so called
&quot;national communism&quot; of Lenin/Stalin/Mao/NK/modern China, etc. are just different varieties of authoritarian state capitalism.</p>

<p>Real communism IMO is anarcho-communism: workers directly control the means of production, no state, no classes, no money.</p>

<p>State capitalism (such as Leninism) : beurocrat authoritarian dictators control the means of production.</p>

<p>I believe real communism is not going to happen until we hit a post-scarcity society. Eastern and western powers have bullshit everyone into picking so called &quot;communist or capitalist&quot; dictators/authoritarian corrupt psychopaths. </p>

<p>Similar to how the American two party system and corporate media pretends Americans have a choice of left vs right when really the Democrat and Republican party are far right NEOliberals.
The Democrat party may be pro-LGBT rights (does not affect the elites at all) but it doesn&#39;t change the fact their economics are extremely deregulated, giving cronyist power to banks and corporations.</p>

<p>Rigged in so many ways.
This is why you don&#39;t believe in left and right.
They do actually exist but the elites pretend their far right puppets are &quot;moderate&quot;, all bullshit. Extreme capitalists control us:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/1peIWYG.png">https://i.imgur.com/1peIWYG.png</a></p>

<p>Also in many European countries, many of the parties pretend
to be &quot;left wing&quot; &quot;centrist&quot; or &quot;moderate right&quot; but actually pretty extreme right wing.</p>

<p>RT and BBC have lied, pretending Macron is a centrist lol. The guy wanted to get rid of worker rights, he&#39;s a far right NEOliberal. Hence people protested against his anti-worker rhetoric.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To us Chinese natives, its looks more like that it&#39;s Xi&#39;s successful wrestled enough power in the past 5 years, his power hungry nature and his fancy toward Mao&#39;s time (which he praises / defends in public countless times) combined have led him to this point. 
Of course, TPTB may very well be the helping hand behind his success, considering how dumb Xi is (Bush Jr level, misspelling stuff kind of dumb).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, CCP is, since I could read and speak, constantly in power struggles. Xi &#39;s 1st term presidency is the result of Shanghai faction (led by 3nd generation &quot;core&quot;, Jiang) fighting the 
Communist Youth League &quot;CYL&quot; faction (led by Hu, the 4nd generation) as a compromise between the two, since he is from the 3rd faction, the princedoms, whose parents were high ranking officers during Mao&#39;s time. These princedoms are typical children of nobility that believe in bloodlines and Mao&#39;s ideas, Xi no exception.</p>

<p>He made many enemies in the last five years, wrestling power from EVERYONE, including his 2nd in command Mr. Qishan Wang, who spoke against his cult of personality. This term limit lift could be a sign of him winning completely. </p>

<p>Me personally find Xi and the current status of CCP very much like Leonid Brezhnev and Brezhnev&#39;s time - A mediocre bureaucrat dark horse facing stagnation, consolidated power but made a lot of bad decisions.</p>

<p>His vision of China is basically Mao&#39;s, planned economy, militarism and cult of personality. It coincides with NWO agenda to some extend but no direct link between the two so far ... right ? </p>
