<p>One consistent trend within the last 100 years has been the total disregard for each other, love, our ecosystems, etc. </p>

<p>There seems to be someone trying to hurt humans over time, not immediately, it seems like someone is purposely manipulatively destroying our genetic bank to try to get us to go over to being a more technological based life form.</p>

<p>Something is trying to destroy the genetic bank of Earth, and wants us to reform, to lose our emotions, to lose out biology. </p>

<p>This may be malevolent or benevolent but in all honesty, it is likely a VERY BAD THING. It seems that we are electromagnetic beings that live on a specific frequency that is &quot;excitable&quot;, there may be other types of electromagnetic beings that have a slower frequency/not as emotionally tuned/less biological than us trying to do this so we could possibly be &quot;of use&quot; or &quot;approachable&quot;.</p>

<p>Wifi stops plant growth, they have saturated the air with radiation and vibrations, they have poisoned the land with aluminum and other toxins (things don&#39;t grow properly in aluminum), the ocean has been irradiated.</p>

<p>Our air is poisoned with aerosols and other various electromagnetic devices. Our Land is poisoned. Our ocean is dying. </p>

<p>The earth can easily sustain more than 20 Billion people who put a small effort in each, we aren&#39;t even close to the amount of people we could &quot;truly&quot; hold, and we are also at a great birth decline, so things are leveling out. There is no way our actions are powerful enough to result in the things that have happened. </p>

<p>I believe Humanities greatest mistake was introduced to us somehow, nuclear fusion, and it was immediately designed in a destructive manner.</p>

<p>Everything is designed this day and age in a destructive manner, people act in a destructive manner, etc.</p>

<p>I believe we are being manipulated forcibly through biological/and other means to become more genetically damaged, resulting in us having to rely on technology/or something else for some specific reason.</p>

<p>END.</p>

<p>Side node, anyone know how one can astral project? I have tried all online guides, they suck, tried the hemi-sync from the Gateway-Voyage thingy, nothing seems to work. </p>

<p>EDITED: Said trillions of people, lel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also the way entertainment (tv shows, films, games) are edited. They get faster and faster every other year. Recently some new american cartoons have become SO fast paced not even teens or the kids can coherently follow them, they are edited/cut so fucking fast. They speak faster and faster, with camera cuts everywhere. And it has been consistently getting faster. A lot of cartoon critics have been talking about it recently, it&#39;s getting way too ridiculous now. If you thought modern TV was fast in 2007-2014, wait until you watch new TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sugar is a massive problem. Alzheimers is a metabolic disease like diabetes, and it starts decades before it&#39;s diagnosed.</p>

<p>I thought I was eating reasonably well, but after awhile I developed a habit of drinking a bottle of apple juice a day. I almost never drink Coke, but one day a can of Coke was sitting on my desk, and the bottle of apple juice. I compared the two, and the apple juice had more sugar.</p>

<p>I immediately cut all liquid sugar out of my diet. Black coffee, zero calorie flavoured carbonated water, a bit of lemon juice in water, stevia flavouring, or a particular brand of coconut water that only has 11g of sugar. That&#39;s all I drink. It took about a year, and very slowly the pounds started melting away. My mind became clear; my chronic pain issues from old injuries and inflammation became more manageable. Then for about 3 months I started working around my house doing maintenance, and doing some rust removal and repairs on my car, so I was doing 1-3 hours of hard physical labour a day and the pounds just started dropping off. I think, you kind of need to lose the fat stored in the muscle first, so it&#39;s not so obvious, before your body starts burning the fat stored under the skin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cycles man. I think we all can agree that energy or vibration can not simply vanish into thin air, that is simply not possible. I want you all asking yourself what happens with the energy that is stored in animals specifically brought up for meat consumption? What energy goes into the milk that most of us are drinking when you repeatedly rape and steal away calf&#39;s from mothers? How many eggs did you eat in your lifetime and what were the circumstances that the eggs came from? </p>

<p>Without getting into the immense pumping of antibiotics into the animals and feeding them improper food (corn to cows mostly as it is government subsidized and &quot;cheapest solution&quot;).</p>

<p>We can all blame fingers across the room, but first lets see whos doing the pointing. You are what you eat after all. We in this shit, not because some vile people decided to fuck all for personal gain. </p>

I had them also, and i still have some melancholia in me now and then. But once i understood there is nothing solid to begin with, i started to see there is something more important in this &quot;reality&quot; than the material stuff.</p>

<p>To me this is a part of why the ME and all other chaotic superficial stuff are happening and/ or created. I think if one does not get the messages behind the chaos and can&#39;t find their calmth in the Love and Unity of Humanity while everything arround them seemst to fall apart they might get dragged along for a dark ride into a even darker future.</p>

<p>Try to see the beauty behind the chaos, the light shining throught the cracks in the lies, obstrucions and constructions created by some, used against Humanity.</p>

<p>It uses life form mind slaves to harvest the energy by being bullies. They cause fear and pain to release this energy and then they absorb it.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>anyone know how one can astral project</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My understanding is that it&#39;s much easier when you&#39;re young. You might try focusing on lucid dreaming, if you&#39;ve had no luck with astral projection. I&#39;ve ordered some Entada Rheedii seeds for a few bucks on Ebay to give that a try, just for kicks. I used to be able to lucid dream fairly frequently when I was a teenager, but when I tried to astral project I&#39;d be able to feel like I was floating out of my body but then I&#39;d just stop there. I definitely found that I was able to train myself to lucid dream by basically making a habit of looking at my hands during the day (so I would look at them when sleeping) and I was able to focus on and perform certain actions by planning them out in advance. I&#39;m not sure about astral projection, but it seemed to me that most people could train themselves to lucid dream through meditation (learning to focus the mind) and practice.</p>
