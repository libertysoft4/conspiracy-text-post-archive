        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me preface this by stating I hardly use any social media. It creeps me out so I only use Facebook, because I am required to manage the club at my college I am president of, and Instagram because of my photography freelance work. I would ditch even these if i could. Also worth noting I&#39;m rather careful with what my apps have permission to use.</p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<p>The first time this happened I had a long conversation with my Dad one night about different colleges and options for my future. My phone had been sitting next to me, unused for the duration of this conversation. Afterwards I pulled up Instagram only to see an advertisement for one college my dad had kept bringing up throughout the night.</p>

<p>The second time I noticed this was after a phone call with my dad. We had been discussing an upcoming project we are planning, a digital night vision system, and discussed how we also needed a helmet to mount it on. After the phone call and again on Instagram I saw an advertisement for a guy using an armored helmet with night vision mounted on it. The ad was specifically for the helmet, which is also the one part we haven&#39;t ordered yet.</p>

<p>I wanted to share not only to see others thoughts but also to perhaps bring some more awareness to how far Big Brother actually reaches. It is far outside just the government.</p>

<p>TL;DR: My phone listened into &quot;private&quot; conversations and displayed targeted ads to me.</p>

I figured that the government was listening in for sure, I just did not expect so much of the private sector was as well, and to use it so blatantly. Although the government and private sector are in bed together so it does make sense. Just a shock at first I suppose </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt it. This is one of those things that so many people swear blind is happening but not one has shown any evidence that it&#39;s going on (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0SOxb_Lfps">this cut, cut, cut video isn&#39;t evidence</a>). It&#39;s the kind of thing that security researchers would be all over and would have exposed in no time at all. It would be very easy to see this going on.</p>

<p>If you want to experiment yourself then buy a prepaid Android phone that you can root and install something to monitor which apps activate the mic. Don&#39;t enter any of your details or use WiFi with it of course.</p>

<p>You could also revoke all mic permissions from apps on your current phone, but then you may be bias against noting coincidences. </p>

<p>However, this isn&#39;t to say that it&#39;s not possible. Although it would take some serious malware to deliver its own ads across different apps. Data mining is something that intelligence agencies and legit companies like to do, those who write malware that isn&#39;t aimed at intelligence gathering aren&#39;t in a position to run tailored and targetted ads in the first place. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/business/media/alphonso-app-tracking.html">But aside from the odd bit of spyware some apps have been caught listening in to collect viewing data.</a></p>

If this were something that was happened, IMO people would have found the code, or packets, or some sort of evidence of this. But I don&#39;t think there is. In theory if a phone was monitored 24/7 and the network was inspected, something would come up. Even if it were encrypted packets. The data has to be sent.

<p>Another day, another redditor a half step away from developing class consciousness and an understanding of what socialism is actually about... </p>

<p>p.s. all these comments talking about &quot;Facebook&quot; or &quot;instagram&quot; like literally any app couldn&#39;t do this with the right permissions. Who would give up all of this data? Always assume your data is being sucked up, because it can be used to create accurate predictive models to generate profit. That&#39;s why data is digital &quot;oil.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep same here. It’s happened to me several times. Most recently I was talking to my girlfriend about Disney world. Showed up on my Instagram feed the following week. Maybe a fluke.</p>

<p>The most obvious one was that at work I was talking about the Dyson hair dryer with two ladies.  I am a guy, I have never ever searched for a hair dryer, definitely not a Dyson one. TEN minute later it showed up on my Instagram feed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can disable the microphone and camera on your phone if you&#39;re worried about this kind of spying. Some electrical tape over both should do it, although then you&#39;d have to plug in headphones or use bluetooth to actually make/receive calls. </p>

<p>And yeah, I think we&#39;re basically to the point where people just accept that this happens even though the companies don&#39;t generally admit to it and we lack absolute concrete proof of it.</p>
