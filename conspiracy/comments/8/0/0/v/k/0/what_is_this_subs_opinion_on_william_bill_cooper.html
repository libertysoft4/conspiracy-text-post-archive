He was well beyond his years in trying to wake people up to the agenda of world government and how secret societies have infiltrated government and are gradually taking away freedoms. They murdered him after he correctly predicted there would be an attack in New York and blamed on Osama Bin Laden. RIP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read it at 15 after my mom met him at a writer&#39;s/self publisher&#39;s conference in Northern AZ and brought home an autographed copy (I still have it). This was a year prior to 9/11. When 9/11 happened before my eyes, at 16 years young, I immediately distrusted the narratives being shoved into our collective conscious. Then, I found out he was killed by the local sheriff&#39;s deputies. That experience made his message incredibly visceral and has remained with me to this day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s helpful to do your own analysis OP. Some of the things Bill Cooper said are just things he learned by doing his own investigations like the investigations we&#39;re doing, so in these cases, he&#39;s just as susceptible to deception as we are, and he&#39;s not in any position to testify to any greater knowledge than we are. At the same time, some of his intel is insider intel, firsthand witness testimony, from his experience in some Top Secret, Navy something or other, I forget. It should be noted however, after writing Behold A Pale Horse, Bill Cooper came to believe that he had been shown false information intentionally, specifically about extraterrestrials. He believed that he was being used, that he was intended to go on and unwittingly become a disinfo agent by whistleblowing this false information about aliens he had been shown. So there&#39;s a lot of mixed info, mixed sources of information, in the things Bill has said, and it requires you evaluate it yourself to parse it all. My judgment though is that he was an honest guy with a keen eye for what&#39;s up. Not all the intel is good intel, no, but he was genuine at least, and he had understanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was never aired on CNN- go back and listen to the broadcast on &quot;The Hour of the Time&quot;. It&#39;s entitled CNN something or other, and he talks about how they tried to manipulate what he said with edits and so on. IMO, he was the real deal and no one comes close to his passion for truth and his love of country. Bill had balls and brains. His &quot;bullshit&quot; goggles, as he called them was one of his best assets. He could use his common sense to pick apart a lot of the b.s. thrown our way.  He rarely thought or acted on emotion. This made him very dangerous. RIP Bill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good amount of what he revealed were from sources he would just read from. Anybody could track the sources down and verify them. I was most impressed with the quiet wars and silent weapons (or something like that) that he quoted. So much destructive psyop we can look back recognize. The attacks on the family— toxic feminism, drugs, sexual chaos, materialism, propaganda.  This was done to this country and many others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is the horse of death pale or green? I thought it was green. </p>

<p>Anyway, no one knows what the intention of Bill C. were but he was part of the &quot;revealing&quot; crew...Rousos, Cooper, Jones...etc. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust anyone who gets to talk on CNN. that&#39;s my rule of thumb.
You have to keep in my what O&#39;Brien said in 1984. You must be skeptical of any opposition vocal enough to be heard by the masses and allowed to flourish. Such opposition is more than likely  false or its being used as a honey pot trap to subdue the truth or give the hope that there is an opposition when there isn&#39;t one at all. In other words, it&#39;s a tool of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even so, that does not make him belong to genuine honest movement or revealing. He could have been seeded by the intel departments he worked for in government. All you need to do is find the right person to seed, they may not even be aware of the manipulation. Like Winston, Cooper could have been completely genuine but the opposition ideology he was apart of was being weaved by dark forces to trying to create a false opposition or one that did not exist at all.</p>

<p>Remember, the resistance never existed or became a tool of big brother. O&#39;Brien was Goldstein. He wrote the book.</p>

<p>This does not mean true opposition does not exist!! i&#39;m saying beware of the  opposition voices on the Big Brother telescreens of CNN and BBC. That&#39;s not real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He might well have been in the process of being groomed by TPTB to become a dependable controlled opposition tool. But I think something went wrong... or right, if you will. His admissions later about the whole UFO phenomenon being just another deception, one he himself fell for at the beginning of his career, plus his encyclopedic research into the true religion of those really in power might have been the tipping point that made him go from valuable puppet to dangerous element. </p>

<p>He could very well have surpassed Alex Jones in public recognition due his actual knowledge and experiences. But he saw the charade and decided not. </p>

<p>So, the cowards lured him out his home and shot him. And today Jones sells millions of pills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Bill was legit, but he was being used as tool unwillingly. I feel the same about the Florida shooter. Once the Agency found a willingly victim with sick ambitions: they gave him tools and the go ahead. Perhaps even convinced him. The FBI visited him how many times? yeah, certainly they were planning something with him. They think we are stupid. isn&#39;t it odd every shooter has long liaison with them, it isn&#39;t by chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was seeded no doubt, those giving information may have lost the narrative when he would not give up his fight. He might have been completely legit amidst a manufactured narratives ready to deploy with a willing vpice who believed he was doing good. Once they lost control of him, they got rid of him.  and bam! comes along Bill Hicks as Alex Jones all in make up and ready to go!! I think Bill C. was the test pilot for how they can manipulate the deep south nationalist guys and the truth moment in general. But these time, they would use of their own the Joe Rogans, Jones and Rousos of which all are their inside boys! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on the recommendation from another user here, I very recently finished listening to Cooper&#39;s series on Mystery Babylon.
It was very long, but well worth the listen.</p>

<p>At some point I plan on re-listening to it all again in conjunction with my own independent research. So many (new to me) topics and research rabbit holes were introduced that I think that I was missing out on some of the finer points. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link to the playlist if you&#39;re interested.
