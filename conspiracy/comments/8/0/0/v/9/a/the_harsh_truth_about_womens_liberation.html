        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><pre><code> The truth about women’s liberation is a harsh one. Hard for most people to accept as well. But the truth is women’s liberation was manufactured behind the scenes by some of the most powerful men in the world to help cause a complete breakdown of society and give more power to the state. The central planners, notably the Rockefellers, with help from many media institutions and even the CIA hailed women’s liberation as something great. Something progressive. Something amazing. When in fact it is causing a complete ruination of the family which seeps into society and destroys everything 
</code></pre>

<p>The propaganda put out by the women’s liberation movement was to make it the ultimate goal for a woman to get into the workforce and make something of herself. They put it out there that married women were being oppressed by their spouses and that women were only judged by the amount of kids they had in this evil, oppressive world. All the sitcoms and tv shows made it seem like single mothers were extremely unhappy, as they had to deal with a stupid husband and rowdy kids who were up to no good. They made it hip for women to go out in the workforce and do what they want with their bodies, and stay away from men and stop having families. Giving women all these opportunities sounds great in theory but actually it has caused massive repercussions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>More power goes to the state. Women’s liberation came and the government was able to start collecting tax from the other half of the population. Also as single motherhood rates continue to rise, that creates more need for government benefits and single mothers also vote for the left in overwhelming numbers, which also advocates for more government and more power to the state. Also as more mothers are busy with work, kids are spending less time with the family and more time under government funded institutions. It’s fair to say these government funded daycares are highly Marxist and left leaning. Also child daycare leads to feelings of abandonment, emotional disorders, and the constant need for attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Depopulation. With women’s liberation, women have become more busy with work and less inclined to be with men and start a family. Birth rates in America along with other western nations are at an all time low and they are lower than replacement level. </p></li>
<li><p>Higher illegitimacy rates and higher single motherhood rates. With women’s liberation came the idea that women should be able to do whatever they want with their body with no regard for the impact it has on the future and the idea that single mothers were strong and valuable proponents of society. Single motherhood has brought along a multitude of problems. Kids with single mothers are much more likely to get involved in crime, drugs, and degenerate behavior that leads to a more chaotic and unproductive society. Today in the US, 1 in 4 children under 18 are raised by a single mother. 27.5% of single mothers are jobless and they are 5 times more likely to be in poverty than a married couple. </p></li>
<li><p>Unhappiness. Since the 70s women in the USA and Europe have reported feeling less satisfied with their lives. It turns out stay at home moms are much more fulfilled with their lives. And the greater the number of sexual partners a woman has, the less happy she tends to be because she does not value herself and her body.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Women’s liberation has been a complete disaster for America and Europe. While there may be some arguments for it, it’s hard to deny that it is one factor that is causing the complete breakdown of the west and it was most certainly an inorganic movement funded by some of the richest, most diabolical people on the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sticking to just your second point, besides the fact that the world population continues to decrease, &quot;depopulation&quot; in industrialized countries is not an argument reenslave western women, but rather one to liberate the women of the rest of the world too.  Stabilizing human population for a little while would be tremendously advantageous for our species long term, given the ecological crisis facing the planet.  Additionally, saying that because people make a choice that you don&#39;t like, once they are free to choose, they shouldn&#39;t be allowed the freedom to choose anymore, is another way of saying you&#39;re losing an argument and thus want to just impose your answer by force.</p>

<li><p>I don’t agree with Bill Gates theory that we need to reduce the world population. I tend to believe that it’s just evil, diabolical, globalist depopulation propaganda. There is certainly plenty of food to go around and the global warming myth is beginning to collapse. Also instead of using Bill Gates theory of coming in to help those nations that are experiencing massive booms in population, wouldn’t it just make sense if we closed off those nations from the rest of the world and allowed nature to run its course instead of giving them food, medicine, and vaccines? Bill Gates advocates for the complete opposite.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s not saying I’m losing the argument necessarily, it’s just saying that I believe I am more in tune with reality and I am more capable of making good decisions. That’s not necessarily saying I’m losing the argument, but it’s me saying I think it would be best if you had other people around to save you from yourself. We do live in a Republic after all and not a direct democracy. I think most people are idiots or cowards when it comes to making political decisions so maybe it would be good if someone smarter, stronger, more benevolent took control by force </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like textbook fascism.  If you think global warming is a myth, you&#39;re probably too detached from objective reality to have a rational discussion, but it is important to remind you that global warming is a major driver of the mass migrations from non-white countries that so terrify you, as well as (to a lesser extent) of well-educated women&#39;s reluctance to have more children.  You&#39;re losing the argument in that, because your side cannot convince women to do what y&#39;all want, their right to choice must be forcefully removed.  That&#39;s what rolling back womens&#39; liberation means in practice. </p>

<p>You generally don&#39;t seem to have a problem with the powerful imposing their will on the weak, but I&#39;d just caution you that that because a dangerously slipperly slope.  Trying to close off the nations that aren&#39;t white enough for you by force, while simultaneously rendering them uninhabitable, is a recipe for genocide.  Even if the west finds the military power and political will for a long term war of extermination (and even you should agree that that is a big if), it seems pretty reckless to commit to that when there are still much easier options on the table.</p>

<p>Also, any regime that can exterminate other countries, reduce half the species to subservience, and allow the strong to take governmental power by force, will not be one that ultimately respects your rights.  When the AI factories and hunter-killer robots come online, what use do you think that fuhrer you&#39;re hoping for will have for you?</p>

<li><p>The global warming thing, I don’t have the energy to get into that, but you should look at the people behind that operation. The Illuminati wants a carbon tax, it’s that simple</p></li>
<li><p>Yes I do want to forcefully stop women from voting, but not in a violent and harmful way. Yes women tend to vote against my interests so I think it would be good for me if I was able to force them to stop doing so. Just like I would want to force anyone to stop doing something that I didn’t like. The reason laws exist is to prevent people from doing things that you don’t like and could prevent or make the survival of future generations more difficult. I also want to forcefully stop people from murdering others, forcefully stop people from using opioids and other destructive painkillers/drugs, forcefully stop anyone from engaging in destructive behavior that could put the survival of people or future generations at risk.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t have a problem with powerful people imposing their will on the weak because that is the way of natural law. You don’t see animals holding back on weaker animals. I have a problem with powerful people exploiting weaker people in a manipulative, unfair way which is what the US government has been doing for essentially its entire existence. </p></li>
<li><p>I’m not advocating for genocide or mass extermination. You seem to be the one that wants to drastically reduce the world population, so maybe you’re the psychopath I don’t know. And no, I’m not ok with a more powerful AI lording over humans, because the ultimate goal is to preserve the existence of myself, my family, and the human race. I would not be ok with an AI takeover and obviously I’m against it. It is in our instincts to protect our own kind, I don’t know why you think I’m going to be ok with an AI robot takeover especially if it means I will die so it can happen </p></li>

<li><p>You&#39;ve got climate change backwards.  The people doing their best to prevent a carbon tax are TPTB, the oil companies, CIA, and central bankers.  Same people as funded radical Islam, btw.</p></li>
<li><p>You can&#39;t deny people a fundamental right which they&#39;ve enjoyed for their entire life without some amount of violence and harm.  Thinking otherwise is delusional.</p></li>
<li><p>Natural law isn&#39;t a good thing.  The whole point of sapience is using reason to overcome natural laws.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;Wouldn’t it just make sense if we closed off those nations from the rest of the world and allowed nature to run its course&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>Closing a nation&#39;s borders against their will in order that their population die qualifies pretty clearly as mass extermination.  </p></li>
<li><p>I know you&#39;ve got a tenuous connection with reality, but what I actually said was that stabilizing human population for a little while would be good for the species long term.  That&#39;s not arguing for drastic population reduction.  BTW, by parroting elite climate propaganda, you are advocating for drastically reducing human population, whether you know it or not.</p></li>
<li><p>Whatever you want w/ AI, if you&#39;re supporting the strong over the weak sooner or later you&#39;re going to be on the wrong side of that.  If you help the elite defeat everyone weaker than you, then when the elites develop the tech to do without your muscle there will be no one left to help you.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Geezus Krist. How did this comment get up voted? &quot;Forced&quot; into caretaker rolls? Who ever forced women to marry and have kids…in the west…in the last 100 years?</p>

<p>And wtf is wrong with being a &quot;care taker&quot;? When the hell did molding the next generation become some &quot;McJob&quot; with no upside or importance?</p>

<p>A woman maintained a home and cared for and raised the children. A man went out and toiled at some shit job and brought home a pay cheque that furnished the home…fed the family…bought the clothes, paid the utilities etc. He didnt just stuff all the money into his fn pockets. That sounds like an equal division of work load and responsibility. In many homes in times past women took the cheque the man brought home and set the budgets. </p>

<p>That you or anyone would denigrate the job my mother and her mother and many other mothers did throughout history just shows me how far fn backwards we have marched as a society.</p>

<p>Instead of pushing women out of the house to the detriment of children and families perhaps we could have just shown them the love and appreciation they truly deserved for doing a job that is perhaps the most important job there is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean the one that referred to the immensely important job of maintaining a home and raising children as…</p>

<p><em>a lifetime of servitude instead of being given the right to self-determination</em></p>

<p>You might not be old enough to remember a time when a child could come home from school and find their mom there waiting with a smile and a hug and a hot meal and maybe some chores to earn a buck or 2 and the self respect of doing some work…instead of an empty house that allowed a child to basically do whatever they wanted.</p>

<p>I remember it and can&#39;t help but wonder if the real issue with kids today is that many of them no longer have mom&#39;s who can focus on making a home and raising them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Having a single very demanding, uncompensated job as the one you&#39;re meant to default into without complaint regardless of personal inclinations, while men get to choose from literally everything else.</p>

<p>Regarding your edit, I had a stay-at-home mom. Was great when I was young -- less so when she became deeply depressed and overmedicated when I was around 11 or 12 (at least that&#39;s when it became really obvious, no telling when it started), which lasted until she went back to work when I was in my late teens. It doesn&#39;t suit all women. Now, she&#39;s retired and RVing around the continent on her own for fun. She&#39;s an adventurer, not a homebody. Individuals vary.</p>

<p>Really? Men can choose from LITERALLY everything else. Because, you know, all men are the same and every one of them has exactly the same opportunities. No men come from poor families that couldn&#39;t afford secondary education, or from families that didn&#39;t value education who then had to settle for manual labour jobs that broke their bodies and did nothing to stretch their horizons.</p>

<p>You seem to be stuck in a pretty narrow view of men and women. Not all men have it great and not all women are the slaves you make them out to be.</p>

<p>I wonder if you&#39;re aware just how non organic and manipulated the lib movement was at it&#39;s inception. I would suggest looking into a fellow named Edward Bernays and how he manipulated entire generations of women to become smokers, as just one example.</p>

<p>Collectively, yes. Their gender rules out nothing. Other circumstances might -- that&#39;s just life. But Everything else there is under the sun is open to men in general, if other circumstances aren&#39;t in their way as individuals. I think you probably know this is what I meant and you&#39;re just being deliberately obtuse, though. </p>

<p>Some women are happy as stay-at-home moms. I emphasized that in my other comment. It should be <em>up to them</em>, however. That&#39;s absolutely key. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see…so a black man by virtue of simply being a man has LITERALLY every option available to him. Or a white immigrant man…or a poor man.</p>

<p>&quot;Collectively&quot;…lol. Are you reading this stuff out a feminist magazine? There is no &quot;collective&quot; of men. There are &quot;classes&quot; of men and many of those classes have nowhere near the opportunities of others.</p>

<p>Men die earlier than women with bodies broken by years of hard work…men suffer from heart disease and strokes at higher rates than women. If you think simply being a man means the world is your oyster then you haven&#39;t been on this planet for as long as you need to to see the big picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it’s not about “Freedom”. That word gets thrown around a lot, but it doesn’t mean much. Should people be free to shoot up as much heroine as they want even if that makes them dangerous to innocent people around them? I don’t believe so.</p>

<p>So I don’t look at things through the scope of freedom. I look at things through the scope of how does this make people happy, and protect future generations from a degenerative society? And the truth is that the family tends to be better when women are stay at home moms and women also tend to be happier and more fulfilled as stay at home moms. </p>

<p>As for women’s suffrage, I think it’s fair to say that women tend to vote more on emotion rather than logic more so than men. And I think it’s fair to say that most married women still tend to vote with their husbands on most things. This idea that women were so oppressed because they were not allowed to vote is extremely overblown, and many times voting was a family decision before 1919. </p>

<p>It is proven by multiple studies that women have become more unhappy as their rights have increased, so maybe I’m not the bigot for denying their freedom, but you’re the bigot for denying their happiness </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going to go ahead and guess that you&#39;re a man. It&#39;s easy to argue that other people should be born into a lifetime of servitude instead of being given the right to self-determination you enjoy. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for women who want to be stay-at-home moms being stay-at-home moms. It shouldn&#39;t be stigmatized. And I do think it&#39;s messed up that a single income can no longer support a family like it used to, taking away that option from families who want it. But the mere thought of being in that position makes me feel claustrophobic. Fuck no. I would want to die. Anyone who would force that on me while keeping a world of options open for themselves is no better than a fucking slave-owner. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the reason why a single income can’t support a family anymore is exactly because of women’s liberation. More women in the workforce created an oversupply of bodies which led to more unemployment and more young adults having to live with their parents. Also the increasing number of single mothers creates a massive burden on the state to give them government benefits and more health care and it also creates more people who want to take money out of the average family’s pocket and give it to someone who is more degenerative and did make worse life decisions. There are other factors at play, but I think if there was a complete overhaul of the system we live in, it would certainly be possible for 1 persons income to sustain a family, and even give them paid holidays and vacations. But maybe I’m just a dreamer </p>
