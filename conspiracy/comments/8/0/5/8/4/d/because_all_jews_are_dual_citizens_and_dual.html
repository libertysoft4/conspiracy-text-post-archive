    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t make that comment, and I think that line of reason is missing the underlying point. Essentially the fact that you are correct in the latter part of your comment here highlights that, these politicians cannot dutifully be loyal to two kings so much as they may try. They strive to be but one of the kings will always come up short handed. That calls into question their reliability as a politician for either king&#39;s domain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct, it’s called the “law of return” which just guarantees any Jewish person Israeli citizenship..... but that doesn’t mean every Jew is automatically given Israeli citizenship at birth or anything.....</p>

<p>The OP is essentially trying to say “well since they could have dual citizenship whenever they want, that basically means they are already dual citizens”...... and every so often you’ll see someone on here post a list claiming “look at all these dual citizens in our government” with nothing but the Jewish members highlighted, that plays off the same type of logic </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with Paul on many of his stances but that doesn&#39;t mean they were inherently religious, or more accurately are not within the ideological boundaries of libertarianism. </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t think that abortions are something the state and taxpayer money should be going towards, this has more to do with his morals and how he thinks the government should be entrusted with using the citizen&#39;s money. If citizen&#39;s vote for abortion with their taxpayer dollars than that fits his bill as a libertarian because the people and the states make their own decision.</p>

<p>Same goes with the next one, he is keeping the federal government out of the state&#39;s domain by (quoting the summary) &quot;giving states the option to display the Ten Commandments in public buildings or on public property.&quot; Obviously someone who is not religious would not think to put them up in the first place, but that&#39;s where being a citizen and being a politician comes to a line. It appears to me that he upheld libertarian ideology by giving states the right to make their own decision in regards to religion (state/federal are two very different monsters and should be treated as such).</p>

<p>The next one, I&#39;ll just lay out the text and see what issue you may have there. As far as I can tell it makes it so that people can&#39;t extort money from the government based on cases that are founded on religious elements of people and past peoples&#39; religious affiliation. I think this is important, even as an astute agnostic, as we should not tread upon the boundaries of one&#39;s personal religion so long as it is not affecting others in their own practice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“(b) The remedies with respect to a claim under this section are limited to injunctive and declaratory relief where the deprivation consists of a violation of a prohibition in the Constitution against the establishment of religion, including, but not limited to, a violation resulting from—</p>

<p>“(1) a veterans’ memorial’s containing religious words or imagery;</p>

<p>“(2) a public building’s containing religious words or imagery;</p>

<p>“(3) the presence of religious words or imagery in the official seals of the several States and the political subdivisions thereof; or</p>

<p>“(4) the chartering of Boy Scout units by components of States and political subdivisions, and the Boy Scouts’ using public buildings of States and political subdivisions.”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that&#39;s not liberatarian and respective of an individual person&#39;s beliefs while simultaneously keeping the government out of picking sides one way or another than I don&#39;t know what is.</p>

<p>Final one, defer back to the original claim/citation/response.</p>

<p>TL:DR - This was more an excercise for myself, in that I usually find when people reference Paul&#39;s actions in an attempt to discredit him or present them in an unfavorable fashion they are usually done without looking below the surface level or even understanding how libertarian ideology interfaces with a person&#39;s personal beliefs or religion in a way that is only concious of how the government should be allowed to act and is only based on exactly how the constituents of a given government has specifically voted for it to take place with respect to all those that are participating. </p>

<p>Disclaimers - I&#39;m not religious in any sense, I think that healthcare should cover contraceptives and abortions (perhaps with some limitations for abortions - That need a real discussion before I&#39;d feel comfortable with any definitive solutions) and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other things I could address before other false assumptions are made about my beliefs solely because I&#39;m &quot;defending&quot; (more accurately stated as &quot;fairly representing) Ron Paul and his actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay, I am more willing to get on board with that, but I do not think you will ever get a ban on dual citizens.  Obama&#39;s birth certificate most likely set a precadence (sp?) for all US politicians, also Arnold Swartz...  I don&#39;t feel your heritage always influences a person&#39;s values.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you feel about immigrants joining the military? </p>

<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger was born in Austria and became the Governor of California. He is a dual citizen of Austria.</p>

<p>The US doesn’t keep track of the number of dual citizens in the US. Estimates range from 494 million to 5.7 million. Dual citizens come from over 93 nations. Increasingly, middle eastern nations like Saudi Arabia and UAE.</p>

<p>I suspect the government is full of dual citizens and not just Israelis. </p>
