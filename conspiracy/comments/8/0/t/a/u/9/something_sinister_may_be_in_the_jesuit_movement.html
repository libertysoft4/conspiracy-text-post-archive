    <div class="md"><p>I went to a Jesuit school as well and the only thing I can think of is they were likely complicit in the pedo priest cover-ups in the early 2000s.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Warraq">Warraq</a>.  There used to be a REALLY good video on YT that is no longer there...see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcN2ADZiBqQ">here</a></p>

<p>And there is the apparition in<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMEWxRB-1dc"> Zeitoun</a> as well.</p>

<p>There was one from Medugorje that I saw a LONG time ago that was supposedly a Mary apparition, but I swear it looked like a fire wheel.  Like a line of flames moving in a circle.  Looked kinda surreal, but could have been man made.  Fire wheels are seen in mythology though.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am more worried about the popes. kolvenbach and arupe resigned instead of dying first as is customary. ratzinger did the same.  that means there are five active popes at the present time manning the hierarchy.  nothing signifies the unprecedented importance of the times more than this.</p>

So Alfonso Nicholas is the only retired black pope it&#39;s still crazy to think that there is a retired pope and black pope which is completely unprecidented.
