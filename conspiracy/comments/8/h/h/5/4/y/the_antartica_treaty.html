if the antartica treaty was signed by all nations, as it is supposedly stated to be a restricted airspace as well as being restricted to all civilians, what is the actual purpose of antartica, and why do people assume that antartica is the wall of ice that surrounds us while other conspiracies have claimed that there is more undiscovered land beyond antartica? what exacty is the whole story behind this entire treaty?    as a side note i am a conspiracy theorist and have looked well into many theories. </p>

<p>1) unknown/mysterious location only visited by top officials</p>

<p>2) plebs keep out.</p>

<p>3) fuzzy science logic used as a reason for keeping away.</p>

<p>I honestly think Antarctica is kept off-limits because of how much damage it would do to the Earth, well, mainly the human bit. If we go down there and start dicking about in the snow, it will melt. Then the sea level will rise, then shit gets fucked up real quick.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in global warming (the science money grabbing version), but I do believe that a block of ice that size, melting, isn&#39;t good for man nor beast. </p>

 it has been sanctioned as a restricted zone, not just &quot; please keep out&quot;.</p>

 there is no such thing a global warning that was just another idea invented by the government to keep more people in line.</p>

<p>what if we actually started to dig into the 3000 mile ice plateau.?</p>

<p>what if it were to melt, what exactly would happen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) It&#39;s mysterious and unknown. It has a lot of mysteries and unknowns about it. How did the ice get there, why are there maps from the 1700&#39;s where it was jungle and fertile land. Why is this land mass so massive and at the bottom of the globe, how did it get there etc?</p>

<p>2) Fuzzy science logic to say global warming is man made. It isn&#39;t, it&#39;s a naturally occurring event that fucks us up every 100,000 years or so. </p>

<p>3) Let&#39;s not find out.</p>

<p>4) Ice is denser than water. If the ice melts the water rises. Eureka!! We shout as the water spills over the edge of the tub and drowns most of our land. The Earth is already 2/3rds water. Let&#39;s keep it that way.</p>

<p>5) Raise the sea level 100M and most of the major cities in the world go underwater. Not to mention the knock-on effect to industry, trade, crops, power generation, homelessness, relocation, civil unrest...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the ice was formed due to the ice age. other than that, its about who the original civilization was, and what is supposedly underneath the ice.</p>

<p>global warning is a hoax, global warming is a way to subliminally mess with people. </p>

<p>it got to where is was from when the original land mass was pangea.</p>

<p>whats not to find out, if people do find out then they are more susceptible to understanding the truth. a big fat why not?</p>

<p>so its been a theory that if antartica where to actually melt that we would be underwater, what is you hypothesis on this, do you have any links that support your own claim.?</p>

<p>if the water were to raise 100m, then those who would be smart and logical, would move to higher ground, othewise it would be another way that the government would want to slowly kill off half the population in order to meet their Georgia guidestone &quot;requirements&quot; to cull off half the population and bring us down to about 500k.</p>

<p>what else can be easily explained. aside from the conspiracy for now as a whole</p>

<p>I&#39;ll chuck one more in : </p>

<p>The native Americans, Incas and I&#39;m sure a few more civilisations were wiped out due to diseases (European diseases) that they had never encountered before. The crew that opened king tut&#39;s tomb fell to a similar fate, that of disturbing bacteria that has been wiped out for millennia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>allow me to propose a simple test for you to try out to show how Antarctica melting would cause sea levels to rise. get several ice cubes and fill a glass with water right to the brim. the brim of the glass represents the current sea level. leave the ice to melt and return. notice that the glass has overflowed and is now sitting ina puddle. Picture instead of the water puddling at the bottom it instead travelling further up a beach and engulfing land. </p>

<p>my question to you is if you really doubt that this is a thing that happens where do you propose the additional water would go?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the correct comparison.</p>

<p>When you have ice melt in a glass you&#39;re not adding water to your glass, therefore levels won&#39;t be rising.</p>

<p>The melting ice raises sea levels because it&#39;s ice melting that currently not in the sea, thus adding more water into the equation. </p>

<p>Perhaps this is what is meant by the illuminati card game that says flat Earthers &quot;know <strong>something</strong>&quot; and their weird geography may lead them to hitting a &quot;gold mine&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>During the Great Flood, about 4300 years ago, some of the floodwaters froze in place around the edges of our flat, stationary earth, and formed an ice wall interspersed with some land, which we now call &quot;Antarctica&quot;. Other places in the world were not as cold and the temperatures rose above freezing in the summers, which left only frozen mud, which we now call permafrost. In the temperate and warmer places, vast inland lakes were left, which then drained off into the newly created oceans over the next few centuries - causing sea level rise of several hundred feet as evidenced by the underwater forests just offshore from Alabama, the United Kingdom and elsewhere. </p>
