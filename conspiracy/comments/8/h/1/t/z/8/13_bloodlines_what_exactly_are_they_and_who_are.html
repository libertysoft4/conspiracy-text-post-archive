<p>Many different sources, whether historical or modern. For instance, researching  International Law will open many doors in regards to this topic. Learning about where International Law comes from, who administrates it, the difference between Sovereign and subjects, difference between Civil Law/Code and Common Law, Contracts, etc etc. </p>

<p>It may seem completely unrelated, at first, but it truly relates to it all, and how these Bloodlines get away with what they do and how they still exist parallel (or above) the Government(s) till this day. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a small few people who actually talk about these Bloodlines, to my knowledge. Jordan Maxwell is one of them. As far as I know, there is no comprehensive trace, due to many factors. I&#39;ve been trying to document for sometime now. It always seems to stop at Rome. Going further back than that, has proven to be quite the challenge.</p>

<p>This is what I&#39;ve seen as a major issue in a lot of conspiracy theory research in general: we don&#39;t really have good tools and practices to gather, store, analyze, and present information effectively, and the internet might have made this worse. </p>

<p>Once you get deep enough down enough rabbit holes, and it doesn&#39;t take all that much time, you realize that it&#39;s not so much individual people or events or even corporations and governments, but the connections between them and the patterns that persist and mutate over time. </p>

<p>And yet, if you look at <em>most</em> conspiracy theory information is presented, it&#39;s either presented linearly — looking at one person, group, or event at a time in relative isolation — or it&#39;s reductive — e.g. &quot;it&#39;s the zionists&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s the black nobility.&quot;  (Not that I&#39;m saying it&#39;s <em>not</em> the zionists or the black nobility or whoever, just that that reductiveness is not ultimately helpful.)</p>

<p>And I say it&#39;s not helpful because whoever &quot;they&quot; are, they clearly understand and employ systems thinking. Finding examples of conspiratorial behavior and even taking down key figures in their operation is futile if the systems that facilitate the conspiracies remain in place. </p>

<p>Have you ever messed around with or used graph databases professionally? I&#39;ve been getting into Neo4j recently, and it seems like it could be quite useful in mapping the connections and relationships between all these people, families, groups, and events, and also with analyzing and presenting them. </p>
