        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Once we are curious enough to investigate the discrepancies and injustices we see all around us, we turn away from the “news”, “MSM”, “hive mind”, and begin to formulate our own independant thoughts.</p>

<p>This path is designed and inevitably leads to a feeling of anger, alienation, righteousness, and soon helplessness, frustration, and somewhat liberation.  But not enough.</p>

<p>If you are reading this, it’s because you have compassion, you care, and want things to be better and just.  Or you’re getting paid to argue.</p>

<p>At the end of this entire process, we all come upon quantum physics, mechanics, the improbable odds of life ever existing at all, and may wonder why.  You also realize Freewill (a divine right) exists, and in so, analyze that everything spread across the news, governments, mafia, gangs, movies, music, tv shows, and peer pressure are designed accordingly to make sure the populace does not truely understand the power of Freewill in numbers.</p>

<p>The truth is, by observing, participating, and creating, you are playing the role of God.  It’s easiest to think, understand, and truly know your divine purpose.  Every action we make is defined by LOVE. We cannot define it so easily, but it boils down to two things;  Service to Others, or Service to Self. Society as a whole cannot exist with Freewill in a Service to Self world.  God, our ultimate purpose of which we all come onto this planet, is LOVE.  </p>

<p>LOVE requires action, not emotion. Love requires dedication to other beings.  We are all of God, we will all end up as one again, whether in the soil, or the soupy source in vibration. We split from the source to experience, rebel, or guide others.  You will never die, your consciousness is an eternal gift, I am.  </p>

<p>The real conspiracy, the secret teaching of the ancient schools, are made to hide your true existence.  Through knowledge of eternal life no man shall fear for his death, but welcome Heaven, Valhalla, Nirvana, or whatever you would name it.  Fear on this Earth is made to keep you from your true potential.  The real potential to change the world, remove power, equal playing field, and bow to no man.  If we acquiecse to any thing other than LOVE we will be bound to repeat until we learn the lesson.  </p>

<p>Be Godlike, in both decision, form, and mind.  This Earth is all of our learning ground, paradise, and hell, not just for the few.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell from my human experience, God doesn&#39;t reward anything, because everyone dies. Whatever &quot;rewards&quot; you receive in this life for evil acts, are but fleeting, transient things. I don&#39;t think the race for power produces joy. It produces a high, and those chasing it are like adrenaline junkies, always chasing the dragon of bigger and better. When they are down, they feel nothing but suffering, and when they win, they feel temporary bliss. Not a fulfilling way to live.</p>

<p>As a former abused child, this claim creeps me out.  This statement is an assertion of trust instead of accountability when applied to politics.  &quot;You should trust Hillary/Giuliani/Obama/Trump/corporations/military, they are not acting out of hatred&quot; is not acceptable.</p>

Bongzilla did have an interesting point, but the way it was condescendingly (and immaturely) being delivered didn&#39;t stir any positive conversation, at least from my perspective.

<p>That&#39;s just a dumb statement, I even said the opposite. But I&#39;ll go with it since you need this argument to make god a viable idea (which it never was). </p>

<p>First there were no humans at all. No mammals either. Then there was. AMAZING. Something must have happened that made it possible right, or was it all divine mythological magic from a guy born of a virgin? lmao</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of the comments here are from ugly hating son&#39;s of bitches. Overall, writing under a false name, anonymously, without consequences or exposure of the true self, this &quot;Reddit&quot; unleashes the writer from responsibility for ones own words.

You might say Reddit is to writing as pornography is to procreation. Conclusion: articles that tend to elevate in this venue are doomed to be turned vile and unwholesome. &quot;Do not cast your pearls before swine for they will stamp them into the mud then turn and rend you.&quot;</p>

<p>As far as I can tell from my human experience, God doesn&#39;t reward anything, because everyone dies. Whatever &quot;rewards&quot; you receive in this life for evil acts, are but fleeting, transient things. I don&#39;t think the race for power produces joy. It produces a high, and those chasing it are like adrenaline junkies, always chasing the dragon of bigger and better. When they are down, they feel nothing but suffering, and when they win, they feel temporary bliss. Not a fulfilling way to live.</p>
