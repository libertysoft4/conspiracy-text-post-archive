    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gun-industry-funds-nra-2013-1">How The Gun Industry Funnels Tens Of Millions Of Dollars To The NRA</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>While that is still part of the organization&#39;s core function, today less than half of the NRA&#39;s revenues come from program fees and membership dues.</p>

<p>The bulk of the group&#39;s money now comes in the form of contributions, grants, royalty income, and advertising, much of it originating from gun industry sources.</p>

<p>Since 2005, the gun industry and its corporate allies have given between $20 million and $52.6 million to it through the NRA Ring of Freedom sponsor program.</p>

<p>The NRA also made $20.9 million — about 10 percent of its revenue — from selling advertising to industry companies marketing products in its many publications in 2010, according to the IRS Form 990.</p>

<p>Additionally, some companies donate portions of sales directly to the NRA. Crimson Trace, which makes laser sights, donates 10 percent of each sale to the NRA. Taurus buys an NRA membership for everyone who buys one of their guns. Sturm Rugar gives $1 to the NRA for each gun sold, which amounts to millions. The NRA&#39;s revenues are intrinsically linked to the success of the gun business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These things don&#39;t happen all in a vacuum to each other. It&#39;s all related to each other and intersects. The gun manufactures want to make a profit on gun sales. The NRA profits off of the success on gun sales and memberships. It&#39;s in the best interests of both the NRA and the gun sales manufacturers to increase gun sales. So they do whatever it takes and say whatever it takes in order to drive up gun sales so they can both earn a profit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said that increased gun sales are a bad thing. You&#39;re attacking a strawman.</p>

<p>The conspiracy to me, is the reasons why the NRA and the gun manufacturers want to increase guns sales, which is to fill up their own pockets. And they do this at the cost of division and polarization of our society. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The issue is when these interests come into conflict with each other. Are your interests perfectly aligned with that of the gun manufacturer?</p>

<p>At the moment most of the money running the NRA is not from members, individual enthusiasts are also a lot easier to lie to than gun manufacturer representatives.</p>

<p>So when something comes up that would make life safer for responsible gun owners, but hurt gun sales, then you can bet on NRA to do their best to defend sales figures while telling gun owners how hard they are working to defend their rights.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that the NRA is no longer interested in making promoting more effective, enjoyable and safer gun usage for regular people. Instead their main focus is in defending the interests of arms manufacturers, even at the detriment to regular gun enthusiasts.</p>

<p>lol, this guy. I think your premise is a little loose on details to be considered an actual possibility. For the record, I think that Gun Owners of America is a better organization than the NRA, IMO - <a href="https://gunowners.org/donate/donations/join/">https://gunowners.org/donate/donations/join/</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence the NRA is going to sell guns to foreign countries for drugs. If he provided evidence, I would upvote, but as it stands, this is a shitpost. Blaming &quot;NRA shills&quot; for downvoting a shitpost is hilarious.</p>

<p>&quot;Donald Trump supposedly told House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) he supports cutting Social Security but will not admit it publicly because it would hurt his election chances. He openly says he will lie to the people about it because he knows that the people are against it.&quot; 1,250 points, 75 percent upvoted: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4lk9xd/donald_trump_supposedly_told_house_speaker_paul/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4lk9xd/donald_trump_supposedly_told_house_speaker_paul/</a></p>

<p><strong>Response to &quot;But this is just <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> doing it, not <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Many of them didn&#39;t get to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. I checked a while back using an archive. How did the ones that got to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> get there in the first place? This sub&#39;s core userbase upvoted them. Like I already mentioned, anti-Trump comments do really well in here, and you would know this if you spent any decent amount of time in this sub. Even just looking at this thread would show you that. There are many more posts just like the ones I cited above. If you search, some that you will find are at 5 upvotes, 25, 100, etc. Those are just a few of the biggest examples spanning over a year that I decided to use for my comment. </p>

<p>Plain and simple, Redditors were fooled by others who claimed this sub is &quot;The_Donald 2.0&quot; or whatever. </p>

<p>Here are a few smaller threads that obviously didn&#39;t get to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now the fight among investigators is coming out into the open. Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who gave impetus to long-contained probes, told a Senate subcommittee headed by Senator John Kerry that he is getting no cooperation from the Thornburgh Justice Department.
Justice&#39;s Criminal Division chief, Robert Mueller, tells me he will have a hatchet-burying session with the independent-minded D.A. next week, and vehemently denies having told British intelligence to stop cooperating with the Manhattan grand jury.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BCCI was the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a dirty offshore bank that then-president Ronald Reagan&#39;s Central Intelligence Agency used to run guns to Hussein, finance Osama bin Laden, move money in the illegal Iran-Contra operation and carry out other &quot;agency&quot; black ops. The Bushes also benefited privately; one of the bank&#39;s largest Saudi investors helped bail out George W. Bush&#39;s troubled oil investments.</p>

<p>regardless, that has nothing to do with what I am talking about. The point was, that on a subreddit dedicated to consipiracies, a character like fucking Oliver North should be heavily scrutinized <strong>regardless</strong> of your stance on guns or even the NRA. He is a shady character who has been involved in multiple other conspiracies discussed on this subreddit. That was his point. How the fuck could a conpiracy sub, not take issue with Oliver North being an influential (basically government) contributor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What kind of question is that? For one, he could get a bunch of politicians in his pocket. NRA has a lot of money, foreign and domestic.

<p>That said, I would love for someone from the NRA to address the whole death squad situation.  One of the prime arguments among authoritarian liberals in America is that the NRA is a terrorist organization and you hire OLIVER NORTH?  Wat.</p>
