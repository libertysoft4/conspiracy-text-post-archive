<p>So, what you need to do (if you haven&#39;t yet), imo, is look into the &quot;Alternative&quot; view of it all. Dive head first. What does non MS historians/researchers propose/present? </p>

<p>Choose one topic that truly fascinates and interests you. I have one (truth about ancient civilizations and human origins), now find yours, and focus on it. It will help.  </p>

<p>I should note: Not <em>everything</em> you&#39;ve been taught was a lie, but, much of it was (as it was for me and others, as well). </p>

<p>Aye, it&#39;s a break up, really. Look into the 7 stages of grief. From what you said, you are at #3 (we&#39;ve all been there - mind was particular rough, tbh). </p>

<p>You posting your question here tonight is great for you (and us), and you will thank yourself (in the future) for doing it/making the leap.</p>

<p>Hope that helps? Peace, love, and welcome! We&#39;re not in Kansas anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love that break up analogy - it’s so fitting. I was in denial for such a long time but I’m so grateful my bf kept badgering me and forcing me to question and uncover my cognitive dissonance. If it weren’t for him, I would’ve never woken up. </p>

<p>I actually disconnected from my studies significantly this semester because I think it’s pure indoctrination and it’s become so apparent for me that I’m just done. I can’t believe I bought into everything so gullibly and never questioned. It’s ridiculous and I wish I could take it all back. Don’t get me wrong, I’ll finish but the degree is worthless to me. And this is coming from an absolute bookworm/nerd. I loved school and learning but I’ve come to realize that these are increasingly mutually exclusive concepts. And I’m so indebted with student loans it makes me all the more angry. </p>

<p>Sorry for the vent, but I just feel so lost. I wish I could restart my whole life sometimes because I feel robbed. </p>

<p>Haha yes we left Kansas and find ourselves on a reptilian moon base :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, agree. You do it when it’s formal, you should here too. Read everything, cross reference, eventually the bullshit filters out. Viewpoints are awesome but not always grounded in fact. </p>

<p>Also, a bit of common sense and wisdom help too. I been around the block a bit, lots of miles under my belt. This is a 6th sense you can only get with time and experience, it cannot be learned from book or Reddit. 6th sense is like a bullshit magnet that you use along with cross referencing. </p>

<p>Not everything is a conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha I like that analogy. And you’re absolutely right that not everything is a conspiracy - this is spot on. </p>

<p>Do you remember what your first conspiracy rabbit hole was? I’m just curious because I have the tendency of being gullible and sometimes again, like I was taught in school, college, and my current graduate program, I can believe things without credible proof. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really, I want conspiracy stuff to mostly be true. Reptilians, flat earth, UFO’s, aliens, shape shifters, that would be so cool! </p>

<p>Fast and furious was a legit thing, sorta covered up but, I don’t think of it as a conspiracy theory so much as it was just a stupid operation. </p>

<p>Biggest legit conspiracy I think I’ve seen isn’t super exciting... it’s Marijuana. Marijuana was systematically and knowingly misrepresented to make / keep it illegal. Groups of people motivated with agendas collaborating to put out false information about marijuana so that they could benefit. Government officials knowingly provided junk data to justify war on drugs. Big pharm helped keep it schedule 1. </p>

<p>That’s a conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think about Icke? I don’t think I’ve seen people talk about him - but then again, I haven’t been here long. I’m genuinely curious because I was listening to several of his videos and I just don’t know what to make of it. </p>

<p>You’re right, it wasn’t that sexy, I was expecting something more exciting haha. But this isn’t strictly limited to just pot right? If  not mistaken this was a similar approach to LSD. It was being used successfully to help with PTSD and other traumatic mental illnesses and then big pharma and the government shut the whole thing down and now people are petrified of it. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good few places to start. Establishing the Reality of high level abuse is essential before diving into Pgate itself. Dutroux, Franklin, and much, much more show that this already happens. Pgate, and a deeper understanding (that isn&#39;t dictated by the MSM) are possible once you realize this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My advice, find a article that does not make sense.. mark it down and notate it. Then research other articles that are from other agencies and then look for their sources. After link together puzzle pieces by quotes, videos, and other forms. Eventually you will have something to put together. Something that is recent.. Syria. Start solving that puzzle on how we bombed a country without evidence to ignoring it ever happened. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Yes, he’s the only guy to actually report on Pizzagate. He breaks it down for the layman in his “Reality Check” segment, I suggest watching his short summary of Pizzagate then searching out what he’s explaining for yourself and see what conclusions you reach. </p>

<p>Unfortunately he was fired from CBS for his “reality check segments”. Fucking bullshit.</p>

If you saw me in person you would think I was the most innocuous person ever. I’m such a nerdy girl so to get banned is ridiculous - I was so livid for a couple days. I couldn’t believe that they would shut me out without me actually saying hateful stuff. And even if I did say hateful/racist things I shouldn’t be banned, I would just get downvotes into oblivion. I was so mad, you can’t imagine -.- </p>

<p>Honestly, I don’t even want to think about a year from now because of all the horrific things I’ve been discovering. I somewhat wish I was still ignorant because life was much simpler haha. I’ve been hearing about FB planning on developing a software that types what you think and I can see millions lining up for that because “typing is so 2018” but completely giving up every modicum of privacy. </p>

<p>Think of it this way - humans have monetized your DNA. Do you know how ridiculous that is?! What exactly do these companies do with your DNA?! I told my MiL not to do the test and explained to her my opinions and she said “damn you’re right, but I’ll do it anyways” -.-</p>

<p>Yes life was easier to deal with when you’re a drone going about your 8/8/8 day. But once you take a peek behind the curtain it’s impossible to go back, don’t stress though it’ll get easier as you get wiser and can just brush bullshit brigading off, or silly hard headed view points because people don’t want their worlds rocked. My suggestion is to simply provide information and let the people you surround yourself with decide what they believe for themselves. You can’t do anything more than that. Information is everything.</p>

<p>You’re absolutely right that it’s best to be knowledgeable than ignorant. Didn’t Peter Parker’s uncle say that with power comes great responsibility? Well it’s the same with knowledge. I’ll tell you a funny story, I know this guy who works for the DoD and we were in class last year when the Syrian gas attack happened and I mentioned that I made no sense that Assad would gas his own people when he was winning at the time, and that the US engaged in false flags all the time.

<p>I’ve always been obsessed with ethnicities and races, I’m a strange person haha so I always wanted to get it done but then I saw a video by ReallyGraceful in YT about the privacy issues and that woman totally opened my eyes. My bf actually wanted to buy my the kit for Christmas since he knows I love the idea, but I had to decline with so much sadness :( </p>

<p>As a former Airman myself I find that comical. 
You should’ve googled “COINTELPRO” and shoved it in his face. </p>

<p>What did that video explain? </p>

<p>I’ve never even thought of doing this, but the gov already has all my info so I guess it’s irrelevant.</p>

And I can be a complete bitch but I figured that they would then conflate my bitchiness with what I said and completely ignore the truth. They did it anyways, but whatever. They suck hairy assholes. </p>

<p>Ha I just let it go, he asked me out on a date later and I thought it was hilarious. Hahahahaha I can’t imagine my face after he told me that we don’t commit false flags. </p>

<p>Essentially, that the DNA companies are owned largely by Alfabet (google’s parent company) and the info probably gets sold to google (don’t quote me but something along these lines. It’s been a while) The CEO of Google Susan or Karen Wojblahblah is the sister of the ex-wife of Google’s cofounder Sergei Bryn, who herself is the CEO of 23andMe. It’s some hot familial mess that means they basically have direct links between 23andMe and google. Sooo basically google has your dna most likely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that would’ve most likely been their response. It’s similar to what happens when shills come in these threads and ask the same question 2,3,4 times after you reply with links and answers. It’s done to get you to call them dickheads and retards which will then get you banned. Fucking sinister shit haha</p>

<p>Hahah damn seriously? Now that’s a twist</p>

<p>So the DNA companies sell all the info they get and give it to google? I guess the real question is, what is google planning to do with all this DNA? </p>

<p>Haha yes, he did ask me out. It was a little weird but then I stopped talking to him, because of that. Then we had another class and he started to text me and I just ignored him because it was painfully awkward that he knew I had a bf and he asked me out Hahaha. </p>

<p>Well did you hear about the golden state killer? Apparently they found his ass through those sites! My MiL told me that someone in his family took the test and it came back as being similar to the killers DNA and so they clustered a whole heap of people and rifled through his trash to confirm it was him. Then 23andMe and a whole heap of companies put out statements regarding client privacy and basically said “we do our best to protect your privacy but when the police asks, we’ll throw you under the bus and drive over you multiple times” </p>

<p>Haha yeah, he could go somewhere else with all that. Haha telling me there are no false flags yet you work for the DoD?! No dude, nooooo. </p>

<p>Look it up! It’s pretty interesting, I really haven’t had the time to personally since I’ve had finals and I’ve been working extra shifts but I will once I get the chance. The interesting part is that some commenters on this British rag I read were saying that they were happy that the police were using the DNA companies to find killers. Which is cool, obviously, but you have to think about the evil things they could do as well. I’m sure the NSA will be nice enough to send me a backup of my computer if it ever crashed! </p>

<p>As for misinformation and disinformation, there&#39;s less of it about than you&#39;d think. Why should the intel agencies bother producing it when freedom of speech allows irrelevant ideas to proliferate like wildfire without any assistance whatsoever?</p>

<p>Although, that being said, mis- and disinformationists have fewer &quot;themes&quot; than you might imagine. It&#39;s fairly easy to compile a list of their favourite topics.</p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, if your investigations only get more and more complex, rather than simpler and simpler, then you are either on the wrong track, or are at the wrong level (i.e., you are filling in background rather than the foregrounded stuff you originally wanted to research).</p>
