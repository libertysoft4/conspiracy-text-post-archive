You have aligned yourself with these people.   Israel, the only democracy in the entire middle east, who guarantees rights to women/LGBT/arabs, and half of you have fallen into the deception that they are inherently evil.  Iran orders a women stoned to death bc she was gang raped-&quot;Thats cool&quot;.  Iraq throws a gay man off a building-&quot;No Big deal!&quot;.  Israel defends itself from people that dedicate their life to killing jews-&quot;DAMN THEM STRAIGHT TO HELL!&quot;  Wake the fuck up people.  Dont be deceived. </p>

<p>For me, it&#39;s the involvement in 9/11, the other false flags (including perhaps the Syrian chemical weapons), the war mongering, and the rampant bigotry on the ground that they try to suppress.  I love Israeli people, especially Gal Gadot.       </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like Iran or Saudi Arabia, or pretty much any country over there, but they aren&#39;t leading the war charge.  If anything your point proves that this forum isn&#39;t just trump lovers, because Trump loves Israel.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel is the primary beneficiary of the 9/11 attacks - because the attacks whipped the US public into a vengeful frenzy against muslims.</p>

<p>Israel&#39;s goal was to first take down Saddam, the only problem was that Bin Laden was in Afghanistan, and there was nothing - NOTHING - to link Saddam Hussein to the attacks whatsoever.</p>

<p>That problem was solved by LIES told by Bush, Rummy, Colon POW and others whose statements INSINUATED that Saddam was involved - backed up by FALSE intelligence reports supplied by Israel.</p>

<p>Who benefited from 9/11? Did Iraq or Afghanistan benefit? Hardly. Nations destroyed, peoples devastated.</p>

<p>What about the US? Did &quot;we&quot; benefit? Only if you consider the loss of thousands of lives and a DEBT of over $2 TRILLION a &quot;benefit&quot; . . . (though there were certain rich individuals in the Military/Industrial Complex that reaped MASSIVE benefits from the illegal war)</p>

<p>So then, who DID benefit from 9/11?</p>

<p>Israel, obviously. The subsequent destruction of Iraq - followed by the Arab Spring and the take-down of Gadaffi and the assault on Syria ALL greatly benefited the Zionist State, who, at this time, has virtually ZERO enemies in the region that can pose any credible threat to the Racist Zionist Regime.<br/>
They also push the Divide &amp; Conquer agenda.... the jews push for diversity &amp; open boaders in all countries except Israel.
They have been behind all the us wars in the middle east, which is now producing thousands of refugees fleeing their war torn homes. The Zionist perposly cause conflit &amp; hatred between Christians &amp; Muslims to lessen the ability to defend ourselfes from Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok.  what actions?  im assuming you are referring to gaza, correct?  Is it weird that the people of gaza elect Hamas officials to their government, just to ensure the money from Iran doesnt dry up?  Is that weird?  No?  Is it strange that people in gaza claim that Israeli&#39;s are the descendants of apes/pigs and not truly human?  What about the fact that the last 5 people that have blown themselves up and murdered innocent Israeli&#39;s were given a parade reserved for hero&#39;s.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gaza is one of those things, yes. Also, do you think that people living in Gaza give a shit if it&#39;s Hamas ruling or some other entity. They only care about surviving, feeding their families etc. No wonder people living in Gaza sign up for Hamas when they are the only ones capable of providing that. Anyways, I don&#39;t think that Israel is the big evil as certain people on this sub think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so the borders they paid for with blood from the 1967 war where every surrounding country was trying to destroy them?  Yet, they still allow their most holy site to be used specifically by muslims.  why do they do this?  because they want peace.  </p>
