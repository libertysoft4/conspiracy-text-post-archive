When theres a supermarket megastore 3 doors down from you leaving an entire warehouse buildings worth of lights on 24/7. </p>

<p>Being told to never spit a pill into the sink because that one pill might change a whole eco system when there&#39;s a chemical works in your town. </p>

<p>Public notices about bbqs and burning rubbish smoke, when huge factories pump out smoke all day, every day. </p>

<p>Being told at school that wasting 3 sheets of paper is murdering trees and you personally are causing the amazon to be demolished for more paper, when big companies print thousands of millions of sheets of invoices that only get shreaded at the end of the month, turned to pulp, then sold back to the consumer at a mark up for being &#39;recycled and eviro friendly!&#39;</p>

<p>Maybe they&#39;re just pinning the blame on us? Don&#39;t get me wrong, there&#39;s added benefits to the above, most of which involve saving money and generally not being a dick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t agree more. The users at the end of the supply chain are being blamed for the trash and waste that was implemented by the corporations at the top of the supply chain.</p>

<p>Like excessive packaging and most worstly, plastic water bottles. As an end user I <em>don&#39;t want</em> that stuff but I get stuck with it anyway. Some of it is useful for long distance shipping, some of it is cheap containerization for the manufacturer, some of it is for retail display, some of it is retail theft prevention packaging, some of it is just bulked-up packaging to make the product more attractive.</p>

<p>Yet the end consumer gets charged for disposal and blamed for excessive consumption.</p>

<p>In some of my bills, and including IRS tax printouts, there is an extra paper page which states just one sentence &#39;This statement meets the Paperwork Reduction Act requirements&#39;. </p>

<p>Imagine if every public landfill said, &quot;No, we&#39;re not taking Doritos bags (etc., etc.) anymore&quot; and forced manufacturers to collect and dispose of the trash from their product.  It would certainly incentivize low-waste packaging (and ideally totally recyclable packaging if they want to save money) if they had to deal with their own mess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t be hard to get some manufacturers on board with this - bulk sales save the producer the cost of making a package, for a product they can sell for the same price as before. There are tons of workarounds with the end goal of keeping matter out of the landfill. For instance, consumers can provide their own packaging, like jars or bottles, or manufacturers can use the deposit system to make sure their customers return their items&#39; packaging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, those are good points. The trend is shifting towards sustainability bit by bit right now, and I&#39;m sure that more big companies will eventually get on board too.

    <div class="md"><p>Guess what -- when disposable containers and packaging first burst on the scene, and we started seeing soda cans littering the ground, the litter and waste was 100% seen as the manufacturer&#39;s responsibility. It took an extremely concentrated lobbying effort by these manufacturers to make littering and waste be seen and treated as people&#39;s personal responsibilities, and municipal responsibilities.</p>

<p>If it is a priority in your life to make corporations act better, then don&#39;t buy their shit.  It takes effort, but in many cases is possible.  </p>

<p>People forget the first 2 parts of the plan: Reduce and Re-use.  What crap are you buying that you never use?  What are you buying new new that could be gotten at a 2nd hand store?  How long do you keep using what you have?  Etc.  </p>

<p>Avoiding buying crap we don&#39;t need, or buying 2nd hand when we can, is a great way to avoid supporting the corporations.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in that case yes, some of the things is the consumers responsibility. Not buying more then you need is on you, reusing things is on you. That way you will force the company to comply. It is the companies responsibility to abide by laws, use fair practises and to follow the market.</p>

<p>If the law isn&#39;t forcing corporations to do something it should it&#39;s still up to us to make sure those laws are made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s far easier (and beneficial) to lay the blame on weaker, private consumers (who don&#39;t have the &quot;money in politics&quot; perk playing for them) than it is to force large companies to make structural changes. During our worst water shortages here, we were constantly getting ads on TV about personal responsibility, spending no more than X minutes in the shower etc. Keep in mind that residential consumption was (officially) 18% of the total water consumption at the time. All the while, municipal lawns would turn on their sprinklers wastefully, at noon, during the 40<sup>0c</sup> summer....people would have been heftily fined for doing the same at home. </p>

<p>On the other hand, overconsumption and waste of products/food is a driving force in our current global predicament. And that can certainly be pinned down on personal choices. The industry generally acts the way it does to keep up with the constant demand for more, cheaper, and immediately-available products. Of course, this consumer culture was nurtured by the same companies over decades (centuries?) to maximise their market size, but it&#39;s kind of our job to ween ourselves from materialism (they certainly won&#39;t do it for us...).</p>

<p>So in my opinion everyone&#39;s at fault here (yay!), and ultimately we all stand to lose just as much (though obviously poor people and poor countries will take the brunt of the growing impact, as is often the case) </p>

The fact is there are over 7 billion people on Planet Earth, most of which who can&#39;t see beyond their own existence and lack the expansive comprehension to understand that it&#39;s the collective cause and effect and thus the individual, that is so detrimental to climate change. On top of that, Corporations are equally as responsible.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how it all works. This is the essence of politics. False idols blaming us. They are parades around as our saviors to the problems that they’ve created. If they want war, they aren’t going to bomb their own homes, they’ll bomb our homes. And after the bombing a new false idol will present themselves and promise to rebuild us. It’s a complete joke that a 1st grader can see through. Unfortunately many adults have been indoctrinated into thinking they need these puppets, these false idols. I mean really sit and think about the joke that politics and our government is. Criminal organizations that present to us crime fighters who reach into our pockets and unlock our doors for themselves. But yeah, it’s our fault and we need them. Unreal. Can we stop paying taxes yet?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot; But since 1989, six-pack rings in the US have been manufactured to be 100 percent photo-degradable, so the plastic will begin to disintegrate in just a few weeks, allowing animals to easily free themselves from the brittle and crumbling rings.[3] This is in accordance with the US Federal regulation for testing plastic photo-degradation, which is 40 CFR Ch. I (7–1–03 Edition) PART 238.[4]In 2016, SaltWater Brewery developed edible rings that sea-creatures could consume safely.[5][6]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they&#39;re not. They are photodegradable. Photodegradable and Biodegradable are different categories. </p>

<p>Photodegradable plastic is usually made of oil-based polymers, just like ordinary plastic. These plastics tend to break down into small particles of plastic rather than decomposing completely.The idea is that these small pieces will then biodegrade.  Unfortunately, they are often not biodegradable and so remain in the environment.</p>

<p>Biodegradable plastics can be made from oil or from plant-based products. They are attacked by bacteria, fungi or other micro-organisms which use them as food. </p>

It’s a phenomenon which researchers have described in public opinion polling that states that, in the aggregate, public opinion is reasonable and stable. Diverging opinions are voided in a large enough sample. Irrational perspectives are stamped out and what remains is a fairly centric, yet stable perspective. It was a popular view 30 years ago that few political scientists take seriously now. I’d suggest you share fewer of your claims if you wish to obscure your stupidity </p>

<p>Is it really?</p>

<p>I mean, sure, public support and understanding plays a huge role, but any big change is usually kicked off by the ideas of an individual who became lucky enough to develop them. Tesla, Newton, Leibnitz, Christ (if you wanna go there), Ghandi, MLK, ...</p>

<p>That&#39;s what gave Elon Musk his messianic status (deservedly or not). A modern savior of our collective guilt, at least in theory. There are no-doubt many individuals out there with ideas and solutions worthy of public support. </p>

<p>Anyone who is convinced that they&#39;re not one of those inventive individuals should strive to identify them in their surroundings and support their ambitions as best they can. Teachers especially.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J145vnEZX6w">Boyan Slat</a> has found a way to gain support and is now changing the world and solving a real problem. Just as a case in point.</p>

In terms of greenhouse gasses or fossil fuel consumption, naval transport is <strong>MUCH</strong> more efficient than any other form of transport.</p>

<p>Sulfur and nitrogen oxides are bad, but on the other hand, unlike greenhouse gasses, once they&#39;re dispersed you don&#39;t have to worry about them nearly as much; which is why the 230 mile buffer zone on the coast where these ships will be forced to switch to low-sulfur fuels is probably going to be good enough to deal with this issue for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to think that helps, but where I live there&#39;s a frankly absurd trend of corporations charging hefty markups for things that are better for the planet even when they patently cost the corporation less to create (like overpackaged goods costing less than underpackaged ones, for example).  So, even the sensible idea that you have gets manipulated in a way that maximizes profits, that is nothing short of conspiratorial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit, technology should mirror cars. Car manufacturers don&#39;t just make money on the car they sell, they also make money on servicing the car. Even if the person services the car himself, he still buys the parts from the car manufacturer(those that don&#39;t and skimp on critical parts end up paying more).</p>

<p>The problem is these phones aren&#39;t designed to be modified like cars are. It&#39;s a sterile appliance that does it&#39;s job(entertainingly rob your soul). The only factors you can employ to distinguish your phone is to put some stick on jewels or a phone case, but it&#39;s function is largely the same.</p>

<p>There are some novel cases that come with extra battery life, but that&#39;s few and far between.</p>

<p>What people want is to tinker, I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s 2018 and Apple still doesn&#39;t have room for extra storage on their $1,000 phone.</p>

<p>Seeing as we&#39;re pretty much at a processor speed and size bottle neck, the only advancement is in better SoC architecture, and parallel processing. PCBs can only get smaller and eventually they&#39;ll be small enough to be modular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just look at waste that fashion industrial factories leave in the eastern countries. We’re often misguided about how “dirty” the people in India are, because of dipping in the highly contaminated Ganges, when in reality, if you check how the river was before this accelerated and consumerism- centered world, you’ll realise that there’s something wrong.</p>

<p>In my opinion, (and with proof) major companies (like Monsanto and Fast Fashion companies) cause an incredible waste and contaminantion, while from the media and school we learn that we’re the guilty ones. Of course, meanwhile this we’re also being subconsciously manipulated to buy their products and to consume more which would support their activities.</p>

<p>Open up your eyes, and dive deep into the real causes. Only this way (and together) can we do anything to stop this.</p>

It&#39;s far far worse of a greenhouse gas but it&#39;s primarily produced by industrial processes like fracking. But the lying news media has declared that fracking is good for global warming because it produces less CO2. The narrative has been compromised. </p>

<p>I would go out of my way at the end of a class to make sure I put the leftover papers from peers into the appropriate bin, or heck, I would never gun on the gas pedal when a traffic light turned green and slowly accelerate up  to the correct speed so I didn&#39;t waste any gas (I don&#39;t do this now, as I got places to go).</p>

<p>Though minor things, I still try to put the Earth first. Maybe if I ever run Boeing or some military contractor I can change their policies to reflect on a more green perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me provide a contradictory view.</p>

<p>I work at a company, in a city, whose major client is an even larger company.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t use paper, at all. I have a small pad, I&#39;ve used about 5 pages in the past year. </p>

<p>The computers are all laptops that sip power.</p>

<p>The lights are all LEDs with motion activation. They&#39;re off by 5:15 most days, and don&#39;t turn back on until someone walks in the door at 6 or 7am.</p>

<p>Burning rubber is bad, not because of the smoke but because fire has a nasty habit of getting out of control -- my local zoning doesn&#39;t differentiate between burning trash or logs in a firepit. If it&#39;s in the open, you need a permit.</p>

<p>Even a house or car isn&#39;t much more than 20 pages. Maybe the house is 30 if you include all of the crap your realtor gives you...</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re right about things like chemical pollutants, but for most people in the suburbs, automobile tailpipe emissions getting into the water/ground and electric car usage are a bigger concern than using an extra sheet of paper.</p>

<p>So much this. In corporate america, you&#39;ll see the accounting department print entire reams of paper for invoices, copies of copies, etc stacked several boxes high. Months later, the paperwork is then scanned back onto the file servers.  There were always rumors or fear mongering from the legal department &quot;never to delete anything&quot; or even recycle the physical documents that have already been scanned.  And the legal department refused to ever buy into esignatures, so much so that supposedly the total cost to &quot;Fedex overnight legal docs internally (one branch office to another) surpassed $1million.&quot;  I mean they have access to the same servers across the network. Let&#39;s pay premium shipping costs for a physical signature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Indian Tear advertisement that originally pointed public eco-consciousness at private persons was funded by a packaging product consortium called Keep America Beautiful</p>

<p>In the time leading up to the first Earth Day in 1970, environmental demonstrations across the United States focused on the issue of throwaway containers. All these protests held industry—not consumers—responsible for the proliferation of disposable items that depleted natural resources and created a solid waste crisis. Enter the Crying Indian, a new public relations effort that incorporated ecological values but deflected attention from beverage and packaging industry practices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did a massive project on the overall benefits of recycling. I found very little research, and a lot of uncertainty.</p>

<p>Overall, what I did find, is a lot of people saying:</p>

<p>1) Me&#39;re not sure if there is a net benefit to recycling when it comes to non-metal, non-glass products</p>

<p>2) One of the main goals of recycling programs is to make people feel like they &quot;did their part&quot;</p>

<p>3) Recycling can help corporations obtain cheaper, if not free materials (think cell phone recycling programs)</p>

<p>I worked in a recycling plant for a summer. I was told that all the plastic bottles are driven in a truck from NC to NYC and then across the country to CA. From there they are put on a ship to China. They&#39;re processed and sent back to the US. There&#39;s a lot to dig in here, but I&#39;m not convinced plastic should be recycled. Metal and glass definitely should, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth. They are personal choices, but they certainly have an effect on everything else. So by continuing to buy meat/dairy/marine life to consume, people are effectively financing global warming. The runoff from <a href="https://mission-blue.org/2015/02/whats-the-role-of-mass-animal-agriculture-in-ocean-degradation/">animal feces is contaminating water and causing deadzones</a> in places like the Gulf of Mexico and the coast of NC. <a href="https://weather.com/science/nature/news/fish-consumption-shortage-worries">The oceans are predicted to be &#39;fishless&#39; by 2050 because of overfishing</a> (we could see this in our lifetimes). Antibiotic resistance has been a looming threat for several years, and 80% of antibiotics purchased in the US go into animal feed. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/01/indias-farmed-chickens-dosed-with-worlds-strongest-antibiotics-study-finds">Our strongest, last line antibiotic is being used on chicken farms in India</a>. Methane from livestock causes more pollution than the CO2 from the transportation sector, and <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/which-is-worse-for-the-planet-beef-or-cars-1919932136.html">methane is 23x more potent.</a>.</p>

<p>So is diet a personal choice? Yes. But it affects much more than oneself.  Educating people and getting them to quit eating meat is more effective than convincing people to buy bus passes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Pardon the long response.. I&#39;m very passionate about this topic.)</p>

<p>Yeah, the transportation sector is a big one, but its hard because people don&#39;t buy new cars and houses every week, or even every year. These choices are longterm commitments. So even if people educate themselves and want to change, its not something that can be done immediately and inexpensively. Cutting meat and dairy out of your life is a choice we can all make every day, and it could actually save people money every time they go grocery shopping. My groceries cost about 1/3 less since going veg, and I&#39;m healthier than I&#39;ve ever been in my adult life.</p>

<p>One of the most frustrating aspects of educating people about the harmful effects of animal ag is the complacency, the &#39;meatless mondays&#39; which make people feel like they&#39;re doing their part, so they&#39;re off the hook. The &#39;I&#39;ll just start recycling&#39; or &#39;My car has a little green leaf on it, I make good life choices&#39;. People are afraid to truly face themselves, their habits, and really look at how their diet is affecting things. Its tragic, because its really the best way to combat climate change. Every dollar you spend on meat and dairy is a vote for more of that product, which is coincidentally a vote for the leading cause of deforestation, unnecessary clean water usage, and unnecessary antibiotic use. There are tons of scholarly articles about this, I highly encourage you to research this further, or head over to <a href="/r/vegan">/r/vegan</a> to see what the movement is about. Going vegan/vegetarian isn&#39;t as hard or weird as you&#39;d think, and it can make such a big difference. In the last 3 years, the amount of vegans in the US rose 600%. This isn&#39;t a fad. Its a movement.</p>

<p>I am an environmentalist, a true one, that is why I don&#39;t support a welfare state that incentivizes consumerism and destruction of the planet. I favor austerity for people who can&#39;t support themselves, and low taxes for people who are productive.</p>

<p>If the Communist wealth redistribution ends, then we can save the environment and leave a smaller footprint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really about who benefits. Carbon taxes (and trading) are a similar larceny.</p>

<p>By keeping it fairly vague climate change makes sure everyone is arguing rather than focusing on tangible changes.</p>

<p>Chemical run off into water, plastic pollution into water, emissions into air, long term leeching into the ground and also water, fracking, etc.</p>

<p>In polluted cities what is the average reduction in life span for example?</p>

<p>Pollution inhalation is medically the same as smoking cigarettes, it&#39;s just a matter of frequency and the specific mix of chemicals. But one of the most important yet invisible issues is an enlarged heard.</p>

<p>They say, in LA, if you ride your bike more than 15 miles a week you&#39;re better off taking side streets instead of major ones to avoid vehicle emissions. </p>

<p>Diet and lack of exercise aside, cardiovascular disease is the #1 killer in the US.</p>

<p>How much is attributable to pollution alone? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are onto something. I think this has been an objective for a long time. The concept of looking at the consumer pool and then trying to affect change through that pool makes sense. The problem is there is a disproportionate amount of effort into consumer awareness, and almost none into industry awareness. Sure companies do things at an industrial level to affect change, but usually for Goodwill only, and if it was not a PR issue, they would do nothing. They do not want to open cans of worms on issues like water resource. It would open up conversations about who really uses all of the water, and what they and the Government who regulate it are doing.</p>

<p>On the left, you have guys like Soros who fund pro environmental stuff. On the right, you have guys like the Koch Bros who fund energy lobbies. Where I live, we have a lot of oil. On both sides, you have people fighting over who controls the resource but mostly the oil companies get whatever they want.</p>

<p>The activists mostly just wind up as useful idiots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what &quot;reduce, reuse, recycle&quot; has sadly become. It&#39;s all just marketing to make people think they&#39;re making a bigger difference than they are. You should still recycle things, but don&#39;t for one second begin to believe what you&#39;re doing is single-handedly saving the planet. The bottom fell out of the recycling industry in the US years ago, so it&#39;s even more of an empty-gesture now. Even if you aggressively sort your garbage, it&#39;s likely all getting thrown onto the same conveyor belt eventually. Remember when you used to be able to take your glass bottles and cans to a bottle exchange at the supermarket? Most of those are closed now. Incidentally that&#39;s how a lot of homeless people made a little money. You used to see homeless people lugging around huge bags full of cans, because they&#39;d get like $20 that way. Now that opportunity isn&#39;t there so much anymore. Kicking them while they&#39;re down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The single biggest thing we as individuals can do to combat climate change is to stop eating meat. Between global deforestation, water usage, energy to harvest and transport animal feed, waste management of all the animal feces and blood, resources for slaughter, preservatives, packaging, refrigeration, and shipment of meat, not to mention the antibiotics and hormone supplements that go into animal feed, it&#39;s totally unsustainable and fundamentally insane. But the great part is, the meat/dairy industry runs on supply and demand, so the more people choose to stop eating meat, the better it will be for the environment. In the last 3 years, people who identify as &#39;vegan&#39; in the US rose 600%. Its not just a fad. People are finally starting to wake up and make informed decisions with their diet. </p>

<p>On one of those days, my friends and I took the ferry out to Toronto island park, just offshore on Lake Ontario. Looking at the city, we saw the smoke rising from the coal fired generator plant on the East side. It hit some kind of layer in the air, went straight west, and then dropped down right over the downtown core.</p>

<p>It had nothing to do with traffic.</p>

<p>when I was a kid we didn&#39;t have bottled water.  The tap water was pretty good.  The idea of paying $1 or more for a little plastic bottle of water would have seemed funny.</p>

<p>Today, my tap water is cloudy, tastes funny and is pretty much undrinkable.  I don&#39;t even like the idea that I shower and brush my teeth with it.</p>

<p>And certain companies are producing billions of plastic bottles of drinkable water.  Plastic that can&#39;t be good for the environment.  Water that I consume every day because I haven&#39;t got a lot of other options.</p>

<p>In an age of ever increasing technology in nearly every field, I wonder why no advances in safe clean municipal drinking water have come along and the quality of it has actually decreased over the last 2 or 3 decades.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure someone will disagree.  I&#39;ll just have you over for a glass of tap water if you do.</p>

<p>I believe that is because infrastructure is usually funded by municipal bonds or higher taxes, and it&#39;s unpopular to borrow money or raise taxes. Bonds are also driven by the prevailing interest rate which has been historically low for nearly all of my lifetime, at least since the 1980&#39;s. Nobody wants to park money in bonds that return next to nothing when you can get a better return elsewhere.</p>

<p>But anyway, without the funds, there&#39;s no way to take on what would amount to huge public works projects.</p>

In other words it&#39;s usually your wife or friend or daughter telling you to save the trees or save water or whatever. Where I live, water literally falls from the sky for free, in massive amounts, the majority of the days in the year, and I&#39;m still made to feel bad for taking a long shower. I get that it takes energy to make the water clean for use yada yada, but I still think there is a lack of perspective there. The amount of energy it takes to process the water I use probably is minuscule in comparison to the cost to air condition an office building on the weekend when nobody is using it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In an age of ever increasing technology in nearly every field, I wonder why no advances in safe clean municipal drinking water have come along and the quality of it has actually decreased over the last 2 or 3 decades.&quot;</p>

<p>I believe that is because infrastructure is usually funded by municipal bonds or higher taxes, and it&#39;s unpopular to borrow money or raise taxes. Bonds are also driven by the prevailing interest rate which has been historically low for nearly all of my lifetime, at least since the 1980&#39;s. Nobody wants to park money in bonds that return next to nothing when you can get a better return elsewhere.</p>

<p>But anyway, without the funds, there&#39;s no way to take on what would amount to huge public works projects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My idiot neighbor runs his in ground sprinklers every single day - and I don&#39;t even bother pointing out his hypocrisy in passively aggressively critiquing my car washing, because I don&#39;t want to dissuade him from continuing to over water his lawn, since he doesn&#39;t seem to be making the connection between running his sprinklers daily and having to mow his lawn twice a week.
I absolutely love driving a V8 - I drive every day, and every time I have to pull away at a light or out of toll lanes on the highway and get away from some annoying driver, it is so nice to just blaze away. Underpowered cars are dangerous.</p>
