    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s taken 3 different judges to say what many of us have been thinking for almost two years: show us the evidence! Not only that, show us even a fraction, a <em>modicum</em> of evidence to support Russian collusion.</p>

<p>While the talking heads repeat the tired talking points of &quot;Well Mueller isn&#39;t done yet! Just wait and see!&quot;, allow me to give you some advice: don&#39;t fall into the same trap as the &quot;Q patriots&quot;. Like with Q, you&#39;re being conditioned to believe that some savior (Mueller) is in control on the &quot;inside&quot; and is taking care of the baddies.</p>

<p>This causes many well-meaning and intelligent individuals to shift the responsibility we all have towards making this world a better place on to some  nebulous &quot;authority&quot; figure.</p>

<p><em>We</em> are responsible for holding TPTB accountable for their criminality, not Mueller and not Q.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the end, Robert Mueller will either produce the goods and the public will be privy to them or he won&#39;t, just like Kenneth Starr. We will see. Some of us actually want to see if the current people in power have done bad (illegal) things. Two years ago, I would have agreed that the &quot;collusion&quot; charges were unsupported, but much has come out since then. Some need to catch up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of us believe that the whole power structure ad investigative structure of the US gov has been corrupt for many years probably decades.</p>

<p>And the candidate who ran on the platform of cleaning out the swamp, has been slandered since day 1, and unjustifiably accused of being treasonous every day for the past 2 years.</p>

<p>Some of us are justified in being suspicious and dont think that the government has been saintly and pure before Trump, and that they are looking for anything they can to discredit and impeach a threat to them.</p>

<p>What more likely,
 Trump is a Russian spy?</p>

<p>The government has been corrupt for decades and Trump is a wild card and a threat to them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Running on a platform of cleaning out the swamp is very different than actually doing so. Trump has fully re-populated the swamp with new billionaires in charge of programs they don&#39;t understand (Price/Pruitt are prime examples), and then war-monger generals at the heads of all state/military departments. There is no doubt corruption in the US gov&#39;t, but it&#39;s illogical to believe that the entire US gov&#39;t (filled with republicans btw) somehow coordinated to bring Trump down. The people at the heads of the investigation into Trump (sessions and rosenstein) were appointed by Trump himself!!! </p>

<p>You also lose credibility saying all this as an active T-D user who is obviously just going to defend trump...</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the whole power structure ... corrupt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agree because it is true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Trump] slandered since day 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t really agree because it is not true. MSM gave DJT unprecedented free positive coverage before the election, as the Harvard study made clear. When MSM went against DJT, it was mostly upon polarized issues where the population was already decided. This superficial treatment would benefit both polarization and DJT.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of us are justified in being suspicious</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agree to this part only. I am suspicious of the emphasis upon &quot;Russian collusion&quot; as deflection from other more important issues like other election tricks that were sued. I think Russian collusion is important but there are much bigger things going on. I would like to see all of it exposed. Which brings me to another reason to be suspicious:</p>

<p>Most of the investigators happen to be Republicans, the same party that appears to be playing both sides of this entire situation. I don&#39;t trust the Republican investigators to do enough. I suspect that Republicans would like to get rid of DJT no because he is going to &#39;drain the swap,&#39; but more as a tactical measure to protect their party from the damage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>government has been corrupt for decades and Trump is a wild card and a threat to them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mostly disagree because DJT is not a threat to them in the way we at r/conspiracy would like. DJT is not out to drain any swamp or do anything for the people. Rather, DJT is a risk to the established order because he is a &#39;wild card&#39; who creates outrage against the system, and particularly against the Republican Party.</p>

<p>This is very important to understand or at least recognize:</p>

<p>DJT is being used implement the same old Republican policies that have been widely discredited -- deregulation, tax cuts, deconstruction. DJT may also be used at the fall guy later on. I think he will. They&#39;ve done this same kind of thing with the Tea Party. It&#39;s a standard dirty trick.</p>

This whole thing is meant to get buy in from the growing conspiracy theory movement that has grown exponentially over the last 5-10 years.

    <div class="md"><p>To say that there has not been &quot;a modicum of evidence to support Russia collusion&quot; is dishonest and not supported by the very well-know public info.</p>

<p>1) The Papadapalous guilty plea was literally directly related to him discussing cooperating with the Russians. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1007346/download">https://www.justice.gov/file/1007346/download</a> Feel free to read.</p>

<p>2) The Seychelles meeting set up by Nader and attended by Erik Prince and Kirill Dmitriev. A meeting like that doesn&#39;t just accidentally happen, and we know Mueller has already questioned Nader.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/mueller-gathers-evidence-that-2016-seychelles-meeting-was-effort-to-establish-back-channel-to-kremlin/2018/03/07/b6a5fb8c-224b-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.5bb50b4086b4">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/mueller-gathers-evidence-that-2016-seychelles-meeting-was-effort-to-establish-back-channel-to-kremlin/2018/03/07/b6a5fb8c-224b-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.5bb50b4086b4</a></p>

<p>3) Not to mention the most blatant collusion of all with the Trump tower meeting. Literally the definition of quid pro quo as well saw Trump team openly welcome and accept dirt on Hillary Clinton, while offering leniency on russian sanctions with the magnitizky act. Do you honestly believe it was just about adoption??? cmon</p>

<p>4) Kushner back-channel communication attempt <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/us/politics/kushner-talked-to-russian-envoy-about-creating-secret-channel-with-kremlin.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/us/politics/kushner-talked-to-russian-envoy-about-creating-secret-channel-with-kremlin.html</a></p>

<p>5) This list could go on for awhile....</p>

<p>The judges here definitely took a step to assure that Mueller doesn&#39;t go beyond his scope, which seems like a good system of checks and balances that the US should have on a special counsel. To come to the conclusion that the judges statements indicated Mueller has no evidence of russian collusion is simply misleading and untrue.</p>

<p>The allegations against Hillary were leaps and bounds beyond those regarding Trump. Not that there should be apathy towards this investigation, I&#39;m not saying that. I&#39;m just establishing here that the two things you are trying to compare are undeniably incomparable.</p>

<p>With that said, the scrutiny applied to Trump&#39;s campaign should be applied to every campaign of every elected federal representative. This should be the standard instead of the exception. </p>

<p>I see your point and I agree, but I&#39;ll repeat it here, because I think it is apt.

    <div class="md"><p>&gt;T<strong>he first major setback happened</strong> <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-02-21/unexpected-twist-judge-flynn-case-asks-mueller-exculpatory-evidence"><strong>in February</strong></a>, when the federal judge assigned to the criminal case against Trump&#39;s former National Security <em>Judge Emmet G. Sullivan</em>Mueller&#39;s team to turn over any &quot;exculpatory evidence&quot; to Flynn&#39;s defense. </p>

<p>&gt;Oddly, <strong>Flynn&#39;s legal team never made this request</strong>. Instead, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan issued the order &quot;sua sponte,&quot; or at his discretion, invoking the &quot;Brady Rule&quot; -** which requires prosecutors to turn over previously unfiled evidence that might have a material impact on a defendant&#39;s cas**e. Two days before Sullivan&#39;s order, Mueller filed a motion for a protective order regarding the use of evidence in the case, including &quot;sensitive materials,&quot; which would be provided to Flynn&#39;s lawyers by the office of the Special Counsel.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>&gt; Then there&#39;s the judge in the <strong>Manafort Case</strong>, who<strong> excoriated a Special Counsel attorney on Frida</strong>y during a &quot;motion to dismiss&quot; hearing. A <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-05-05/leaked-transcripts-reveal-courtroom-showdown-between-manafort-judge-and-mueller">leaked transcript</a> of the heated exchange between attorney Michael Dreeben and Eastern District of Virginia Judge T.S. Ellis reveals that <strong>the entire Manafort case is in jeopardy if the Special Counsel doesn&#39;t produce an unredacted copy of the original order from Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein authorizing the original investigation</strong>. </p>

<p>&gt; Ellis also said that <strong>Mueller shouldn&#39;t have &quot;unfettered power&quot; to prosecute Manafort for charges that have nothing to do with collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians,</strong> and called out the DOJ&#39;s efforts in the case as an attempt by Mueller<strong> to gain leverage over Manafor</strong>t. </p>

<p>---</p>

<p>&gt; <strong>Last</strong> -** but we&#39;r**<strong><em>e qui</em></strong>t<strong>e sure not lea</strong>st, was last week&#39;s ruling by federal Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee<strong>, denying Mueller a trial delay over the high-profile February indictment **o</strong>f 13 Russia**ns for <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-02-16/special-counsel-robert-mueller-indicts-13-russians-hacking-during-us-election">interfering in the 2016 US election</a>. </p>

<p>&gt; Mueller accused 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities - one of which was <strong>Concord Management and Consulting</strong>, of &quot;knowingly and intentionally&quot; conspiring to interfere with the election by using social media to disparage Hillary Clinton and support Donald Trump.  </p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Time will tell.</p>

<p>Time makes fools of us all.</p>

<p>Time heals all wounds.</p>

<p>Time marches on.</p>

<p>You should read <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/967231/download">Rosenstein&#39;s letter</a> appointing Mueller, specifically point B, subpoint ii where he states that Mueller is allowed to investigate any crimes discovered as part of the investigative process. Even if this wasn&#39;t the case, are you suggesting that a crime should not be investigated and taken to trial because the criminal is in cahoots with a powerful person?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you have to label those who are distrustful of Mueller as Trump defenders?</p>

<p>There <em>most definitely</em> are not two camps, and it&#39;s extremely disingenuous to suggest otherwise.</p>

<p>It&#39;s perfectly reasonable, even <em>logical</em>, to be skeptical of <em>both</em> Trump and Mueller. </p>

<p>It&#39;s perfectly possible (probable) for Trump to be corrupt without having anything to do with Putin.</p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t be surprised that so many conspiracy theorists are rejecting the Trump/Russia collusion conspiracy theory...Mueller has long been implicated in <em>all</em> manners of sordid affairs from the 9/11 and Anthrax days.</p>

<p>Despite your attempts to create a false dichotomy, it&#39;s actually much more prudent to be skeptical of <em>both</em> Trump and Mueller, as well as all of those in authority in government/corporations.</p>

<p>Because your post history suggests that you have it out for Mueller, his investigation, and the DoJ, especially these past few days. You are clearly pushing a narrative, and it&#39;s very coincidentally tin defense of Trump. We&#39;re not stupid. We can see these things because of how obvious you make it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not calling for ending the investigation, I&#39;m just incredibly skeptical that the Steele Dossier will ever have evidence to support its claims.</p>

<p>Either way, you lose. </p>

<p>Two of the three sentences I wrote start with the word if. That means I&#39;m talking in hypothetically. How does that make me confident?</p>
