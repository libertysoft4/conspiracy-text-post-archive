        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>All right go with me on this...the widespread use and interest in the internet started taking off in the 90&#39;s, 9/11 occurs, and the country falls into a slumber. We miss Osama in Tora-Bora, get distracted and invade Iraq. Slowly theories about the Pentagon getting hit by a missile come forth, building 7 must have been &quot;pulled&quot;, and the twin towers fell as a controlled demolition. 911 is used as a justification of two wars, etc...</p>

<p>What if the genesis of the 911 truther movement to a large degree was just a Russian disinformation campaign? Sow pockets of unrest, re-expose old mis-deeds of the US as proof that everything is naturally an evil plot by the powers that be. </p>

<p>It seems to me that Putin comes into power on the eve of the millenium, and as the years go on, nationalism, xenophobia, and anti-immigrant sentiment goes through the roof. Today there are populist uprisings throughout the West, in the UK with Brexit, the latest election in Italy, Trump in the US, all culminating in weakened unity against Russia and their interests. I think it&#39;s more or less proven Russia has influenced as many national elections as they can get their hands on, so I&#39;m just wondering if they laid the foundation for all of this at the dawn of the millenium.</p>

<p>A lot of the videos and sources in Loose Change and The Ring of Power seemed to not necessarily have the best grasp of English, a whole lot of antisemitism, and a strange foundness for the Romanov family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The internal organisation that it took was widespread, needed vast coercion and co-operation and had to be done from within. Putin&#39;s clever and he&#39;s wily (but he&#39;s not a magician). It&#39;s telling that these days I have more respect for Putin than any of the past Administrations. 
The absolute best summation I&#39;ve found on 911 came from James Perloff.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, but do you know about Russian proto-911?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_apartment_bombings">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_apartment_bombings</a></p>

<p>On the boarder with Dagestan, a Dagestani separatist group bombed some apartment buildings, claimed responsibility for it. But then, apartments all over russia started getting bombed...moscow, st. petersberg. Suddenly, these bombs were going off everywhere, however, the original Dagestani group did not claim any of these other bombings. People were scared. </p>

<p>At one place, <strong>Ryazan</strong>, some locals saw a sketchy guy go into a basement so they called the police. The police caught the guy who turned out to be an FSB agent. The stuff they found under the building tested positive as being hexane, only produced in a state-lab in siberia. The government obfuscated the findings. Putin, prime minister at the time, enjoyed an enormous wave of support when he promised to find the terrorists (&#39;even if they&#39;re in the shitters&#39;) and prosecute them at all costs. </p>

<p>He used that wave of support to institute a coup, kicking out Yeltsin&#39;s circle, nationalizing industries, culling a certain circle of oligarchs so he could place his own. He&#39;s been president ever since.</p>

<p>This was in 99.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ll remember, Bush and Putin were buddy-buddy. Even today, I think we regularly see the fingerprints of Putin&#39;s right hand propaganda minister <strong>Valdislav Surkov&#39;s</strong> ideas at work in our own society every day.</p>

<p>More like, maybe we got the idea for 911 from Russia.</p>

<p>A small group of Russian bloggers start poisoning a few jaded people, and slowly but surely it starts to spiral into the truther movement.</p>

<p>Or, ya know, thousands of American government workers all agree to stage a terrorist attack on American soil, because of oil? Regime change? Some sort of coup to democracy?</p>

<p>The best example of compartmentalization, and when I say best I mean most shocking, is probably the Dutroux affair. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of it, but if not, give it a once over. It&#39;s eye-opening</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if... get this...  What if.  </p>

<p>Russia is not doing anything that the us, china, and other countries aren&#39;t doing.  The suggestion that they&#39;re sowing dissent by retweeting legitimate articles that simply don&#39;t look good is actually retarded.  </p>

<p>I refer back to the intel report they released around the time of the one claiming russia hacked the dnc.  They cite RT stories against fracking, and third party candidates as evidence of a conspiracy to undermine america. </p>

<p>Now, if you&#39;re not retarded, you read that and you say what a minute... scientists in the us have studied and found fracking causes earthquakes.  That&#39;s just a fact.  It doesn&#39;t matter if cnn covers it, or rt.  The story is the same.  It&#39;s not an anti american story if RT shows it.  It just isn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>And the fact that the intel community presented that as if it was means that they have nothing.  There is no russian conspiracy.  No, russia didn&#39;t do 911.  That&#39;s just bullshit.</p>

<p>The drills?  What are the odds that a major terror operation just coincidentally takes place at the same time most of the military forces that would stop such an attack are busy drilling for similar scenarios and are unable to stop anything?  </p>

Yours is a country that aggressively pushes its agenda and dialogue onto others. Yours is a country that has a hand in most conflicts world-wide.

    <div class="md"><p>TL; DR I disagree, but rather than say muh Russia, I provided a long response.      </p>

<p>I think you are looking for an explanation to people choosing a viewpoint you don&#39;t seem to agree with.  The fact that you propose Russia is behind it, implies you don&#39;t think free thinkers would pick those viewpoints willingly, unless they were somehow duped. </p>

<p>Nationalists&#39; viewpoint comes from actually understanding facts/data around the issues.  There are easily 2 billion people who would immediately improve their quality of life by just moving to the US (the actual number is closer to 5 billion).  While I&#39;d love to help everyone, we can&#39;t have open borders and survive.  And they aren&#39;t sending their best and brightest.  We are getting their rejects and in many cases their criminals.  Add in the fact that citizens seem to actually be prioritized behind immigrants in many cases (Starbucks hiring migrants over citizens for example). </p>

<p>Migrants coming in to a country and increasing rape and murder statistics can make people nationalists real quick.  Germany and England are shit shows.  Rape gangs in England, Germany telling girls to wear longer dresses to school so they don&#39;t get raped--it isn&#39;t Germans doing the raping. </p>

<p>Also, Russia is hesitant to push any 9/11 truth because of one of their stolen missiles (Kursk submarine) was likely involved in the Pentagon attack (and possibly the towers if you are a no planer). Iran has no such fear, and they pretty much told you who did 9/11.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve seen no evidence Russia has their hands in ANY elections (so not proven), but the US has manipulated elections all over the world.  Russia took a different approach on espionage.  They sowed the seeds of dissent a long time ago, 25-30 years ago.  If anything, Russia may be behind people thinking it is xenophobia that drives a nationalist viewpoint--which is the epitome of intellectually laziness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia was coming out of collapse in 90s and even today is barely a player worldwide.  Canada has a higher GDP, for example.   Russia has huge social problems, from one of th ehighest suicide rates per 100,000 to drugs and alcoholism and other addictions.   While having a relatively homogeneous society, they are several IQ points lower than most white averages.  Combined with a developing nation from post-cold war and it just does not seem plausible for this country to be able to field the most technologically advanced cyber warfare team and influence elections in the world super powers all while rebuilding and dealing with massive social issues.  They have about a 1/3rd the US population as well.  The mere thought of them being able to do the things they are being accused of is laughable.  China, US and Israel are the main players in these fields, yet none are accused of anything.  </p>
