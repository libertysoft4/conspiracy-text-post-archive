    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man, but at the same time, you gotta realize not everyone has to think the same way as you. People can be &#39;blind&#39; and shit, but they can still be fun to hang out with. I know it&#39;s agonizing to hear them talk about issues like they know something when they&#39;re completely wrong, but just keep your mouth shut, smile and nod.</p>

<p>We&#39;re social creatures. We need social interaction to be healthy and happy. A truly wise man understands that everyone is on their own journey, and if you&#39;re truly wise you can council people without berating or belittling them. You can see their problems for what they are, but also understand they need to learn at their own pace, and maybe they&#39;ll never learn, and that&#39;s okay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never talk about it here because this is a conspiracy sub, but I couldn’t agree with you more. The entire plot of the show is almost like it was written by a conspiracy theorist. It’s like you said, the whole plot is to be truly free.

Still ongoing too, they are on hiatus to make the next bit (which I prefer because they dont have to make a bunch of filler to keep everyone entertained while they make it back to the good stuff). But it just keeps getting more and more intense. they just took out the equivalent of drug lords and slave trade. Shit, the enemy was giving children experimental drugs through candy that made them turn into giants but killed them at a young age, also had crazy withdraw symptoms. shit gets real in One Piece</p>
