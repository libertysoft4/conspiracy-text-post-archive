<p>The Earth was once considered flat, just as Pluto was once considered a planet. Also, red meat was once considered extremely unhealthy.</p>

<p>Like these once factual statements, things can be debunked as we learn new information about this million year old planet that we’ve only been recording history on for about 5000 years.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not taking anyone&#39;s word for it, I know the earth is round.. I&#39;ve seen the curvature, I&#39;ve seen objects disappear beyond the horizon, I&#39;ve watched the sun rise and set, I tracked the movements of stars and the celestial bodies..</p>

<p>I own a very high powered telescope, I&#39;ve seen the planets, I know they are out there.. I haven&#39;t seen a flat one yet, but if I do, you&#39;ll be the first to know..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that we don’t know. </p>

<p>It could be globular or domed or a flat plane. You don’t know with 100% certainty, as you have not been to space. Nor have you circumnavigated the entire Earth. Nor have you been to those planets you’ve seen in your telescope and circumnavigated them. You only know what you’ve been told to believe. </p>

<p>I don’t know what makes you think the government would disclose every single detail about everything. Especially if stating that the Earth is flat would cause many other facts to become untrue. </p>

<p>New ideas frighten the majority, so they stick to the reality they’ve always known. </p>

Newton&#39;s third law, says that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
At only 19 miles away from the earths surface, referred to as altitude, the air is 100 times thinner than at sea level, it just so happens that aircraft need air to propel them and lift them, rockets don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aircraft don&#39;t automatically try to fly in a straight line.  There are constant very small corrections needed to stay on a given course at a given altitude, and on a spherical Earth a fixed altitude is a spherical shell around the Earth, so trimming an aircraft to maintain altitude results in a path that curves to follow the surface.  </p>

<p>Even on a hypothetical flat-plane Earth, you could not take an airplane up, let go of the controls, and have it fly level at a constant altitude.  Winds and temperature changes mean the aircraft is always going to try to slightly climb or slightly descend (and in some cases on some aircraft, the issue gets divergently worse the longer you are not making control adjustments.)</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you were to set up an experiment where you shined a high powered laser tangent to the Earth (let&#39;s say off the side of a mountain with a level.) and made a plane which tried to follow the beam straight, on a spherical Earth it would gain altitude until it hit its flight ceiling from gaining altitude and stall and fall down to lower altitude.</p>

So as the steam coming off me starts to dwindle and i&#39;m hoping the vape passes my way I ask so what does D.A.R.E. stand for..i remembered it was drug awareness something but i didn&#39;t remember the rest...keep in mind a few other &#39;flamingos&#39; joined in with upswingery sentences because they were trying to &quot;be like super positive and letting me know about the good cause and stuff&quot;..but the reason why i dub this archetype the flamingos plays true..none of them knew what D.A.R.E. and in unison looked at each other like flamingos do and then reached for their phones in orchestrated unison..they then got short with me and proceeded to smoke and purposefully pass the vape counterclockwise like a reverse in UNO kept happening...point is forget fame but use good narrative movies as emotional metrics of measurement...patience is become an expensive commodity as free time costs money...watch &quot;Branded&quot;, &quot;What Just Happened&quot;, &quot;The Informers&quot; and &quot;The Counselor&quot;..(but after you watch the counselor go on youtube and watch the ending with deleted scenes when he talks about the philosophers stone, and shows misplaced audacity to grammatically correct the person that has power over you)..there are 10 million other things, but analysis paralysis is a real thing and peace of mind should be paramount..but as per flat earth stuff...traversed the earth by sea twice in the late 90&#39;s...saw many perspective from many elevation..the &quot;curve&quot; i have yet to observe..and thought it funny that gps in the southern hemi still don&#39;t work..nav charts compared to globe=remember every few days there were course corrections...i have typed alot ..if you read this far you got fortitude... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFgKVGPJmtI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFgKVGPJmtI</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point of this thread is that these “theories” are simply based on other theories that are based on other theories that were created from absolutely no knowledge at all. </p>

<p>My goal isn’t to debunk the earth being spherical, but to present the idea that it possibly could be another shape based on what we have learned and can assess with our own senses.</p>

<p>Kind of like when you took a math course and knew for sure you had answered an equation correctly, unbeknownst that you were wrong. Imagine if you never found out that you were incorrect and continued to do the equation the same way. In turn, you create other solutions to problems based on what you think you know. </p>

<p>Everything is subjective. We simply have deemed things fact because of others’ testing and not our own firsthand experiences. </p>

<p>And most of the people who simply answer to everything without questioning its plausibility follow a two-thousand year old religion created on a million year old planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except the scientific method is supposed to weed out the bullshit, that is the whole purpose of it. We used to believe the earth was flat, but advancement in how we measure and analyzed the earth proved that it is not the case. </p>

<p>Your analogy of people who are sure they answer a question right but are actually doing it wrong is representing the flat earthers. I&#39;ve watched people try and prove the flat earth a whole bunch of different moronic ways that aren&#39;t founded in logical thinking.</p>

<p>It pretty much always starts from ignorance, and going to a basic physics course would probably aleviate most questions. Except of course the people who just throw out all developed understanding of physics simply because they like to act smarter than hundreds of years of work lol</p>

<p>LOL</p>

<p>You goons can&#39;t help yourself, can you? I mean, you utterly contradicted yourself in less than one paragraph.</p>

<p>The fact remains - you have proved yourself to be utterly ignorant of the topics you raised. For example, claiming that people can&#39;t go to Antarctica and that you can only find vague information on how to do it. I proved beyond doubt that claim is false. Not only did I prove it, I did it by simply typing &quot;Antarctica tour&quot; into Google.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how little research you did into a &quot;fact&quot; you read on some Flat Earth bullshit website.</p>

<p>You&#39;re too funny.</p>

<p>Why is it such a task to get there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry the Earth is not laid at for your convenience, but that&#39;s the way it is. It is a &quot;task&quot; to get there because it is one of the most inhospitable environments on Earth and there is very little chance of rescue if anything goes wrong, so trips there must be carefully planned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to take a plane and a boat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, you can take a plane <em>or</em> a boat. There are airstrips on Antarctica. You can even fly to the South Pole, but that means first landing on Antarctica and transferring to a smaller plane capable of landing at the Pole.</p>

<p>You can also take one of many cruise ships that will take you to Antarctica in comfort and style, but you won&#39;t get near the Pole that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if I’m not mistaken, you need some type of official clearance</p>

<p>You <em>are</em> mistaken. What you are doing is repeating the same lies Flat Earthers keep telling each other while refusing to actually research their &quot;facts&quot;.</p>

<p>Once in Antarctica there are no formalities to be completed and yachts are free to cruise, subject to various restrictions. Most of these are self-imposed and self-controlled. </p>

<p>In summary, the 2004 guidelines state that those organising or conducting tourist or other non-governmental activities in the Antarctic Treaty Area should have in place before the visit “appropriate contingency plans and sufficient arrangements for health and safety, search and rescue (SAR), and medical care and evacuation.” Also available from the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat website are specific guidelines for sites most visited by tourists.</p>

<p>The next tour to the South Pole with this company is on 14 December 2018, it will cost you  49,750 US dollars for a 6 or 7 day stay in Antarctica. That page gives you a full itinerary, including:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once weather conditions permit, you will board our ski aircraft and head for the southernmost point on Earth! Your flight is planned to return the same day but we will bring food and camping equipment in the event weather conditions change and an overnight stay is necessary. The services team will assist you in packing your sleeping bag.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As you near 90° South, you will catch sight of the South Pole station, a cluster of buildings surrounded by snow and sky. The aircraft lands on a groomed ski-way and you’ll deplane near the South Pole marker. Here all 360 lines of longitude meet and beneath your feet the ice is almost 10,000 ft (3000 m) thick!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When there are waves on the ocean, a ship simply floats up and down on the waves, moving vertically without any input from the helm. It works the same way for aircraft.</p>

<p>A wing generates lift through a combination of factors - motion through the air, angle of attack, and density of the air around it. If any of those variables change, the amount of lift the wings generate also changes. When the lift and the pull from gravity are balanced, the aircraft stays at the same altitude.</p>

<p>So, if an aircraft ascends to 30,000 feet, then levels out and maintains airspeed, it will stay at 30,000 feet because gravity is balanced by the lift generated by the wings at that altitude, angle of attack and airspeed. It&#39;s like the aircraft is floating on the surface of a ball of air.</p>

<p>If the aircraft was somehow moved vertically upwards without changing its angle of attack or airspeed, the amount of lift the wings would generate in the now thinner air would decrease and no longer balance out the gravitational pull. The aircraft would drop until the air became thick enough to once again generate enough lift to balance gravity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the boat on the crest of a wave falling into the trough behind the wave until the water stops its downward motion. An aircraft &#39;floats&#39; on the surface of a ball of air that is dense enough to provide the required lift at that altitude and angle of attack.</p>

<p>Like the surface of the ocean, this ball of air can have waves in it. If you have ever been on an aircraft in &quot;turbulence&quot; you have felt the effect of riding on those waves of denser/thinner air.</p>

If it were to go any higher, without changing anything else, the air would get thinner, and it would generate less lift, causing it to drop back down.  If it were to go lower, the air would get thicker, causing it to generate more lift, and pushing it back up.  The plane doesn&#39;t have to adjust for the curve, because physics will do that automatically.</p>

<p>Of course, in the real world, the pilot is constantly making minor adjustments to account for buffeting winds and uneven pockets of air or moisture, just like a driver on the road has to account for imperfections on an uneven road.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t watch a few YouTube videos and become a flat earth specialist.. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not taking anyone&#39;s word for it, I know the earth is round.. I&#39;ve seen the curvature, I&#39;ve seen objects disappear beyond the horizon, I&#39;ve watched the sun rise and set, I tracked the movements of stars and the celestial bodies..</p>

<p>I own a very high powered telescope, I&#39;ve seen the planets, I know they are out there.. I haven&#39;t seen a flat one yet, but if I do, you&#39;ll be the first to know..</p>

<p>The best part is how you are saying that globe earthers are the feeble minded ones.. Answer me one little question please, how do you know the earth is flat? I still haven&#39;t seen a single one of your people prove it&#39;s flat.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except the scientific method is supposed to weed out the bullshit, that is the whole purpose of it. We used to believe the earth was flat, but advancement in how we measure and analyzed the earth proved that it is not the case. </p>

<p>Your analogy of people who are sure they answer a question right but are actually doing it wrong is representing the flat earthers. I&#39;ve watched people try and prove the flat earth a whole bunch of different moronic ways that aren&#39;t founded in logical thinking.</p>

<p>It pretty much always starts from ignorance, and going to a basic physics course would probably aleviate most questions. Except of course the people who just throw out all developed understanding of physics simply because they like to act smarter than hundreds of years of work lol</p>

<p>Why is it such a task to get there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry the Earth is not laid at for your convenience, but that&#39;s the way it is. It is a &quot;task&quot; to get there because it is one of the most inhospitable environments on Earth and there is very little chance of rescue if anything goes wrong, so trips there must be carefully planned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to take a plane and a boat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, you can take a plane <em>or</em> a boat. There are airstrips on Antarctica. You can even fly to the South Pole, but that means first landing on Antarctica and transferring to a smaller plane capable of landing at the Pole.</p>

<p>You can also take one of many cruise ships that will take you to Antarctica in comfort and style, but you won&#39;t get near the Pole that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if I’m not mistaken, you need some type of official clearance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You <em>are</em> mistaken. What you are doing is repeating the same lies Flat Earthers keep telling each other while refusing to actually research their &quot;facts&quot;.</p>
