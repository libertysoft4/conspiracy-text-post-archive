    <div class="md"><p>When Podesta had his emails hacked, the only ones he had deleted where the ones from when he was on vacation in Portugal at the same time/location as when/where she went missing.  Her parents were friends with her friends.  Apparently when she first went missing the mother said “they’ve got her” as if there had already been a request made.  Witnesses have drawn sketchs of the men thought to have kidnapped the girl, they look identical to the Podesta brothers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first I thought the idea of linking Podesta to McCann was absurd. It just seemed incredibly unlikely that they would happen to be linked to one of the most high profile child abduction cases ever. But then I thought; why was the McCann case so high profile? Why did it receive so much more press than the numerous other child abduction cases that happen every year? Perhaps there were certain people in the press who knew what really happened, and were purposely pushing the story to try and expose the Podestas. </p>

<p>This is all just conjecture, but this possibility makes the idea of linking the Podestas to McCann less absurd, if the Podestas were the reason the McCann case was so heavily reported.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Richard D Hall did an in depth YouTube study, including having the parents speech patterns analysed, and the upshot appears to be this. </p>

<p>The parents are lying, Madeline died in the apartment, probably accidentally falling off the couch, her body was hidden in a bedroom cupboard for a few days before being disposed of by the parents. </p>

<p>UK cadaver dogs found blood spots by the couch and alerted to cadaver odour in bedroom and back of parents hired car. </p>

<p>Why? Parents realised they screwed up, probably having their child die due to being drugged so they could go out alone. Panicking they decide to cover up and say an intruder took the child. I am sure they regret not coming clean in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what I think happened, pretty much. Depressingly mundane and horrible.</p>

<p><a href="https://villagemagazine.ie/index.php/2018/02/maddie-did-the-bbc-bend-the-truth/">This is an interesting article</a> about a pair of witnesses who believe that they witnessed Gerry McCann carrying a dead/dying/unconscious Madeleine away from the resort.</p>

<p>In terms of the timeline in the above post, I&#39;d suggest that this sighting occurred during the hasty switcheroo from the cupboard to the back of the hire car.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more detail, including some bizarre evidence manipulation by the BBC, which I can&#39;t get my head round at all.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a topic I like to think about much. It&#39;s really just too horrible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As if on cue...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5698933/Madeleine-McCann-police-spent-four-years-trying-ID-man-GP-said-him.html">This story</a> has appeared in today&#39;s press.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about a different sighting of a man carrying an apparently-sleeping little girl across the holiday resort where the McCanns were staying. </p>

<p>This sighting is far better-known than the one in my previous post. And the police carried on investigating it for years, despite the man who was carrying the child coming forward to be eliminated from inquiries.</p>

<p>Why has one sighting received so little attention, while the other has received so much? I don&#39;t have an answer to that question.</p>

<p>But I suspect that many people, when reading of the Smiths&#39; experience (previous post) will just assume it&#39;s the same sighting made by the Tanners (this post). The two encounters have been sort of smudged into one incident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So?</p>

<p>What is interesting is not whether this is true, but that it has been said/acknowledged by official State mouthpieces. </p>

<p>You should read <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rnvup/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/">my post on common knowledge</a> to learn how to watch/read the news with the appropriate distance, and not being sucked in by identity biases.</p>

<p>As to the <em>actual</em> truth, it is impossible to know if any of this McCann story actually ever happened or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of questions around the parents. </p>

<p>Why did the Cadaver dogs alert in their rental car boot that they hired two weeks after she went missing? </p>

<p>Why did they have the pajamas that Madeline was apparently wearing when she was abducted?</p>

<p>Why did they wash “cuddle cat”?</p>

<p>Why did Kate put in her own book that she was having terrible thoughts about her daughters “torn genitals”?</p>

<p>Why did they dispose of a fridge from the rental villa?</p>

<p>Why did the cadaver dogs alert in their bedroom wardrobe?</p>

<p>Where is Gerry’s tennis bag? </p>

<p>This case has bothered me for so long. I hope one day it really is solved unfortunately I think that the people involved are too important and high up and the truth will never come out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here’s a reminder of the <a href="http://archive.is/jfvIO">48 police questions Madeleine’s mother refused to answer (and the one she did).</a></p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>On May 3 2007, around 22:00, when you entered the apartment, what did you see? What did you do? Where did you look? What did you touch?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you search inside the bedroom wardrobe? (she replied that she wouldn’t answer)</p></li>
<li><p>(shown 2 photographs of her bedroom wardrobe) Can you describe its contents?</p></li>
<li><p>Why had the curtain behind the sofa in front of the side window (whose photo was shown to her) been tampered with? Did somebody go behind that sofa?</p></li>
<li><p>How long did your search of the apartment take after you detected your daughter Madeleine’s disappearance?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did you say from the start that Madeleine had been abducted?</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming Madeleine had been abducted, why did you leave the twins home alone to go to the ‘Tapas’ and raise the alarm? Because the supposed abductor could still be in the apartment.</p></li>
<li><p>Why didn’t you ask the twins, at that moment, what had happened to their sister or why didn’t you ask them later on?</p></li>
<li><p>When you raised the alarm at the ‘Tapas’ what exactly did you say and what were your exact words?</p></li>
<li><p>What happened after you raised the alarm in the ‘Tapas’?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did you go and warn your friends instead of shouting from the verandah?</p></li>
<li><p>Who contacted the authorities?</p></li>
<li><p>Who took place in the searches?</p></li>
<li><p>Did anyone outside of the group learn of 
Madeleine’s disappearance in those following minutes?</p></li>
<li><p>Did any neighbour offer you help after the disappearance?</p></li>
<li><p>What does &#39;we let her down&#39; mean?</p></li>
<li><p>Did Jane tell you that night that she’d seen a man with a child?</p></li>
<li><p>How were the authorities contacted and which police force was alerted?</p></li>
<li><p>During the searches, with the police already there, where did you search for Maddie, how and in what way?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did the twins not wake up during that search or when they were taken upstairs?</p></li>
<li><p>Who did you phone after the occurrence?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you call Sky News?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you know the danger of calling the media, because it could influence the abductor?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you ask for a priest?</p></li>
<li><p>By what means did you divulge Madeleine’s features, by photographs or by any other means?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it true that during the searches you remained seated on Maddie’s bed without moving?</p></li>
<li><p>What was your behaviour that night?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you manage to sleep?</p></li>
<li><p>Before travelling to Portugal did you make any comment about a foreboding or a bad feeling?</p></li>
<li><p>What was Madeleine’s behaviour like?</p></li>
<li><p>Did Maddie suffer from any illness or take any medication?</p></li>
<li><p>What was Madeleine’s relationship like with her brother and sister?</p></li>
<li><p>What was Madeleine’s relationship like with her brother and sister, friends and school mates?</p></li>
<li><p>As for your professional life, in how many and which hospitals have you worked?</p></li>
<li><p>What is your medical specialty?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you ever done shift work in any emergency services or other services?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work every day?</p></li>
<li><p>At a certain point you stopped working, why?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the twins difficult to get to sleep? Are they restless and does that cause you uneasiness?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it true that sometimes you despaired with your children’s behaviour and that left you feeling very uneasy?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it true that in England you even considered handing over Madeleine’s custody to a relative?</p></li>
<li><p>In England, did you medicate your children? What type of medication?</p></li>
<li><p>In the case files you were SHOWN CANINE forensic testing films, where you can see them marking due to detection of the scent of human corpse and blood traces, also human, and only human, as well as all the comments of the technician in charge of them. After watching and after the marking of the scent of corpse in your bedroom beside the wardrobe and behind the sofa, pushed up against the sofa wall, did you say you couldn’t explain any more than you already had?</p></li>
<li><p>When the sniffer dog also marked human blood behind the sofa, did you say you couldn’t explain any more than you already had?</p></li>
<li><p>When the sniffer dog marked the scent of corpse coming from the vehicle you hired a month after the disappearance, did you say you couldn’t explain any more than you already had?</p></li>
<li><p>When human blood was marked in the boot of the vehicle, did you say you couldn’t explain any more than you already had?</p></li>
<li><p>When confronted with the results of Maddie’s DNA, whose analysis was carried out in a British laboratory, collected from behind the sofa and the boot of the vehicle, did you say you couldn’t explain any more than you already had?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you have any responsibility or intervention in your daughter’s disappearance?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>A QUESTION SHE DID ANSWER</em>
Q. Are you aware that in not answering the questions you are jeopardising the investigation, which seeks to discover what happened to your daughter?</p>

<p>A. &#39;Yes, if that’s what the investigation thinks.&#39;</p>
