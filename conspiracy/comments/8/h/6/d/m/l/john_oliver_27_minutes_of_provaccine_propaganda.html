<p>thinking back, it seems that people like this guy is one of the reasons i quit watching TV in the first place. the canned-laughter-after-an-un-funny-joke routine gets old fast </p>

<p>6:35 mentions Dr Wakefield&#39;s study</p>

<p>7:00 &quot;could not find evidence that the MMR vaccine causes autism&quot; (for some reason they must not have bothered to ask any of the multitude of parents who can give them example after example)</p>

<p>7:10 &quot;distorted the data&quot; and &quot;acted unethically&quot;, lost his medical license, Lancet paper retracted </p>

<p>7:35 claims that the claim that vaccines cause autism has been debunked, in spite of the &quot;debunking&quot; existing merely of examples of people failing (on purpose) to find the evidence.</p>

<p>7:45 ahh, so Wakefield talked to the Somalis in Minnesota. that explains how this particular &quot;fake news&quot; story came to be </p>

<p>7:55 RFKjr, Alex Jones, Rob Schneider </p>

<p>9:20, im not anti-vaccine, BUT </p>

<p>10:20 rant about fish</p>

<p>11:00 mercury in vaccines isn&#39;t the same kind of mercury as in fish. its organic mercury, which contrary to its hipster-sounding name, is not more safe than inorganic mercury </p>

<p>11:05 no link between thimerosal and autism. notice how the narrative is constructed so as to be technically correct, but incredibly deceiving? they condition their statement by limiting it to thimerosal and MMR, which is but one ingredient among many, and one vaccine among many</p>

<p>11:15 Thimerosal removed from childhood vaccines except flu </p>

<p>11:50 why was Thimerosal taken out? (as a red herring, to draw attention away from Rubella and CRS/ASD)</p>

<p>12:27 &quot;proving a negative is an impossible standard&quot; (yes, exactly Mr Oliver, that is why when you claim that studies prove that vaccines do not cause autism, we know you are lying, because no study could ever prove any such thing.)</p>

<p>12:50 no evidence Dan Burton is not a donkey fucker. excellent point. i think his script writers really messed up by including this logic in his monologue, because it will come back to haunt him, as any vaccine debater has already figured out through hard earned experience)</p>

<p>13:15 Seth Mnookin, a well documented propagandist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Mnookin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Mnookin</a></p>

<p>&quot;we are as positive an anyone can humanly be that there is no link&quot; </p>

<p>Mnookin is as confident in A as he is in B, because </p>

<p>15:10 he can go on and on and it will never end. gee, i wonder why that is. other topics aren&#39;t quite as controversial. when was the last time you heard people debating whether Pluto was a planet or not?</p>

<p>15:20 &quot;coincidence&quot; vaccines happen just before regression into autism </p>

<p>15:28 &quot;correlation is not causation&quot; (standard vaccine shill talking point. this idea is so embedded into the &quot;thinking&quot; of vaccine cult victims that they are to the point where they automatically reject vaccine side effects, specifically because there is a correlation, as if they expect every causation to exist outside of any correlation </p>

<p>15:34 &quot;thats why scientific studies are for&quot; (so the establishment gets to pick and choose which studies they want to bury or promote, and use their cherry-picked science to claim there is a consensus that vaccines are safe and effective, in spite of countless examples to the contrary)</p>

<p>15:35 &quot;the link is not there&quot; (because the data were removed by the CDC)</p>

<p>15:45 talking about how vaccines cause autism takes away resources from finding the actual cause(s) of autism. right. so in spite of the fact that the establishment has concluded that there is a scientific consensus that vaccines do not cause autism, and therefore have already (supposedly) been looking for other causes of autism. in spite of having many years to find alternative explanations, they have failed to do so. in the meantime, more and more parents witness their children regress into autism after a vaccine, and the establishment just points to their own &quot;science&quot; and says they can&#39;t find evidence </p>

<p>15:59 Alison Singer, Autism Science Foundation </p>

<p>16:14 &quot;you have to say enough&quot; (did she ever find out what caused her child&#39;s autism? studies show she is 99% more likely to deny vaccines caused her kids autism because then she would have to accept responsibility for the permanent brain damage her bad decisions have caused</p>

<p>16:23 definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. but that didn&#39;t seem to stop the establishment from doing the same thing over and over and over... so why did they do it? so they can point at their pile of studies and say &quot;we can&#39;t find evidence&quot; </p>

<p>16:38 &quot;memes aren&#39;t facts&quot;. (except when John Oliver delivers 27 minutes worth of pro-vaccine memes, presented as &quot;comedy&quot;, but taken by vaccine cult victims literally </p>

<p>16:55 parents ask to space out vaccines. </p>

<p>17:09 Dr Bob Sears alternative vaccine schedule </p>

<p>17:33 spacing vaccines sounds like it makes sense, but it doesn&#39;t because eating soap doesn&#39;t make sense</p>

<p>17:46 too many too soon </p>

<p>18:10 because children encounter thousands of naturally occurring antigens, its safe to inject vaccine ingredients into babies. because children are &quot;fucking disgusting&quot;, its safe to inject vaccine ingredients into them</p>

<p>18:35 &quot;where is the published, peer reviewed evidence?&quot; excellent question Mr Purple Tie Revolution, where is the published, peer reviewed evidence that the CDC&#39;s vaccine schedule is safe and effective? </p>

<p>19:20 Oliver completely ignores Sears rationale, that spacing vaccines may help encourage parents who might not have otherwise vaccinated, and goes on to imply that by delaying a vaccine you are putting your child at risk of certain death </p>

<p>19:50 &quot;selective&quot; vaccine schedule... can get vaccinated for measles at late as 10 years old </p>

<p>20:00 vaccines do not cause autism, except when they do </p>

<p>20:13 &quot;opportunistic quacks&quot; (isn&#39;t every doctor opportunistic?)</p>

<p>20:30 the dangers of spacing vaccine are very real (memes aren&#39;t facts)</p>

<p>20:35 CDC says children are at risk of getting disease entire time vaccines are delayed, and those diseases are dangerous </p>

<p>20:47 Measles causes 134,000 deaths each year. So the people who are most concerned about the negative impact of human activity on earth, are the exact same people who want to &quot;save&quot; millions of lives through vaccines?</p>

<p>21:08 &quot;Herd Immunity; the more people who are vaccinated the harder it is for a disease to spread&quot;. </p>

<p>21:25 Herd Immunity for Measles is around 95% </p>

<p>21:30 Measles Herd Immunity drops, Measles outbreak in France.  &quot;at least 6 people died&quot; (hedged facts are fake facts)</p>

<p>22:50 shill formula: not everyone can use vaccines, therefore everyone else must</p>

<p>22:58 Rhett Krawitt, the grandson of a man involved with Glaxo Smith Kline. i wonder why they didn&#39;t disclose this fact? </p>

<p>23:50 &quot;newborns too young to be vaccinated&quot;. so on the one hand, a newborn baby is &quot;old enough&quot; to get a Hep B vaccine on the day they are born, and per 18:10 children can handle multiple vaccines, and &quot;too many too soon&quot; is a myth... why don&#39;t they give every vaccine to the baby on the day it is born? </p>

<p>24:20 anchor yourself to what we know to be true about vaccines and autism &quot;there is no link&quot;</p>

<p>24:30 other side effects happen less than 1 in a million. </p>

<p>25:00 &quot;non existant or wildly unlikely harms&quot; (explains vaccine maker immunity from lawsuits)</p>

<p>26:10 you may hear scary vaccine stories from other parents or on the internet, and its hard not to be terrified </p>

<p>26:56 Oliver vaccinating his premature baby on schedule. not sure why he is delaying the full vaccination, per 21:35 he is putting his child at risk for diseases while he follows the vaccine schedule instead of stepping up the pace </p>

    <div class="md"><p>measles and chicken pox have been with us for many years, and have generally been considered mild childhood illnesses</p>

<p>before the measles vaccine, over 95% of the population acquired measles naturally</p>

<p>and the vast majority of the people had no long lasting ill effects  </p>

<p>they would have &#39;measles parties&#39; to deliberately expose children who had not had measles before to child who had measles</p>

<p>measles parties were considered safe, and since measles infection was nearly ubiquitous, measles parties provided a way to control the time and place of measles infections </p>

<p>measles itself can be considered an essential part of developing the immune system, and growing up and being exposed to a lifetime of pathogens that will challenge the immune system </p>

<p>unfortunately, children are not allowed to be exposed to natural measles anymore, and instead are subjected to MMR vaccines which have all sorts of ingredients that the immune system and body is not equipped to deal with </p>

<p>it should go without saying that its never safe to inject aluminum, mercury, DNA, peanut oil, etc into a baby </p>

<p>in a sane world, this would be considered child abuse </p>

<p>yes, measles has always been a mild infection, and it wasn&#39;t hyped as a death sentence until after the vaccine was invented and needed a sales pitch</p>

<p>today autism is much more prevalent than measles, probably due to widespread vaccinations with MMR </p>

<p>same reason babies are born in a hospital and babies used to be born at home</p>

<p>sorry, but you can&#39;t prove that the small pox vaccine eradicated small pox</p>

<p>furthermore, if vaccines were as effective as you assume they are, wouldn&#39;t there be far more diseases eradicated by now, too years after vaccine quackery began?</p>

<p>logic says that injecting aluminum, mercury, peanut oil and DNA into a baby is not preventative health care, its child abuse </p>

<p>but, since your brain has already been addled by vaccines, i don&#39;t expect you to understand this </p>

<p>Smallpox vaccine didn’t cure smallpox</p>

<p>there is absolutely no evidence that the small pox vaccine eradicated pox. </p>

<p>&quot;correlation doesn&#39;t always quell causation&quot;</p>

<p>you know what actually eradicated small pox? </p>

<p>my prayers!</p>

<p>theres as much evidence that my prayers eradicated small pox as there is that the small pox vaccine eradicated small pox</p>

<blockquote>
<p>autism didn’t exist before</p>
</blockquote>

<p>before Rubella vaccination, autism was caused by the highly unlikely chin of events whereby a pregnant woman was infected by Rubella, and her child went on to develop CRS, and then went on to develop ASD</p>

<p>today, we bypass the natural but highly unlikely Rubella-CRS route, and instead go with the more common, man-made route and induce ASD directly with MMR vaccine</p>

<p>Come on, enlighten me, O great one, I need my crackpot theory of the day fix. Also, I’m curious why you feel the Doppler effect is bs. I know whatever your answer is, will be a great read!!!</p>

<p>the so-called &#39;red-shift&#39; you assume you are measuring is not the same as the pitch-changing sound you hear when an ambulance overtakes you on the road </p>

<p>in your expanding universe theory, everything is moving away from everything else, at the speed of the Hubble Constant (H)</p>

<p>so we assume we know the frequency of a certain stars light, and when measured that frequency is not what we expect, or its more red than we expect, we jump to the conclusion that the star must be moving away from us! </p>

<p>and when every star we measure has this inexplicable red-shift, we conclude that every star must be moving away from every other star...</p>

<p>and when you try to find out just how fast these stars are supposedly moving, which is H the Hubble Constant, you will not find any satisfactory answer, but only vague extrapolations based on absurd assumptions </p>

<p>suffice it to say, if you try to find the speed of H, you will discover that the answer is H approaches C, aka the Cosmological Constant aka The Speed of Light</p>

<p>so in your expanding universe theory, the universe is expanding at the speed of light </p>

<p>H=&gt;C </p>

<p>now, lets assume that its true that the universe is expanding at H = C</p>

<p>would that explain why, when you put more energy into a photon, the photon will change its frequency, but it will not change its speed?</p>

<p>is it because as the speed of the photon exceeds C , it also exceeds H, which means the photon travels into anti-time aka -t</p>

<p>and this fluctuation of the photon between time and anti-time is what we measure as frequency and see as light</p>

<p>or maybe the earth really is the center of creation, right on Mt Zion like the bible says </p>

You are really really a piece of work if you think a of science is a conspiracy. So wired to feeding on bullshit you are, that you feel there is a conspiracy where there need not be one, for example, what effect to daily life is there whether space expands or not? Measures experiments have observed it expands, what’s so hard about accepting it? Instead you call all the observations bullshit and believe earth is the centre of the universe, anti-time and all other PROVABLE bullshit, which no self respecting scientist or college expounds. Why? Why do you have to be against such frivolous things? Because it’s your nature. That’s why. You can’t help but be this because your identity is linked to being the dumbass conspiratard that talks bullshit about innocuous things. So no, I’m not you. My identity is not linked to crying wolf for every thing. But it is linked to thinking for myself and building upon other works that are acceptable to me, and can be replicated.  You say replication. Replicate the proof the earth is the centre of the universe?? That’s there is anti-time?? You got nobels waiting for you buddy, if you do any of the two. BUT YOU CANT, because all you can do is regurgitate half baked occult bullshit. I know types like you, liberal and conservative. Being your brand of retard has nothing to do with politics. 
All you do is say ‘established facts are not facts because I say so. And if anyone says access the easily accessible data I’m gonna our my fingers in my ears and shout LALALALA’. That’s your call. And it’s successful in echo chambers of conspiratards. Just don’t convert this gold sub into one of them.  </p>

<p>So this vaccine is so pathetic that it&#39;s not even 80% effective? Yep it&#39;s in fact so pathetic and useless that it&#39;s only 35% effective, it&#39;s worse than chance. Pathetic, like you, makes sense, you&#39;re like a magnet of pathetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes 35% effective is a horrible metric, it&#39;s even worse for the vaccine as 35% is the upper limit of it&#39;s effectiveness and it goes down on every subsequent shot.

<p>High Cortisol Symptoms
The symptoms of too much cortisol develop gradually and mostly overlap with many other conditions and include[1-3]:
Depression
Fatigue
Weight gain, especially in the face, upper back (“buffalo hump”), and torso
Obesity, especially abdominal obesity/central obesity
Back pain
Thin skin
Decreased concentration
Swelling in the hands and feet
Low libido
Acne
Impaired memory (especially short term)
Female facial hair or female balding
Insomnia
Poor skin healing
Irritability
Menstrual abnormalities
Blood sugar dysregulation/high blood sugar
Decreased bone mineral density
High blood pressure
Easy bruising
Muscle wasting and weakness of arms and legs
Reddish purple streaks on skin
What Causes High Cortisol Symptoms?
Rarely, having too much cortisol is caused by Cushing disease—a hormone-secreting tumor of the adrenal gland. More often, however, high cortisol is caused by prescription corticosteroid medications (including corticosteroid injections into the joints).[4]
Even more commonly, too much cortisol is caused by chronic stress. Chronic stress dysregulates the body’s stress response system (the hypothalamic–pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis). The HPA axis is a critical physiological system that mediates responses to all types of physical and psychological stress. When that stress is chronic, the delicate feedback system that is the HPA axis becomes damaged.[5] This can result in chronically high cortisol levels and lead to high cortisol symptoms.
Certain conditions are well known to cause the types of chronic physical and psychological stress that damage the HPA axis and lead to high cortisol levels. These conditions, which are often associated with high cortisol symptoms, include[6]:
Depression
Panic disorder
Generalized anxiety disorder
Posttraumatic stress disorder
Anorexia nervosa
Bulimia nervosa
Alcoholism
Diabetes mellitus
Severe obesity
Metabolic syndrome
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
Shift work
End-stage kidney disease
Major life stressors
Chronic pain</p>

<p>My limited understanding of the Vietnam war: it was a proxy war sold as &quot;domino effect&quot; to the us public. Its real purpose was fighting USSR and funneling billions into the military industrial complex.

<p>Were you aware that as ordinary sanitation and the standard of living improved with children simply being better looked after when they contracted one that they all went steady down well BEFORE there were any vaccines? </p>

<p>Or that despite all of the vaccines that have come along since they&#39;ve been steadily introduced that there&#39;s actually been no appreciable change in those rates at all?</p>

<p>Do you know what a &quot;true vaccine&quot; like the one for small-pox was?

<p>Are you Amish or are you purposely turning your back to science? I can understand if you are Amish, but you are a dumb fuck if you turn your back to science. Kiddo, CHILD MORTALITY FELL A TON around the world in the last 100 years. Babies that didn’t stand a chance, that died at childbirth, or shortly thereafter, life full and productive lives today. Google it, it’s not that hard. When children died, almost always there wasn’t a technically accurate reason. They just got buried. My niece died to sepsis because she has underlying genetic defect in glycosylation. Even a couple of fucking decades ago no one would have known why the fuck she died. A retired head of pedriatic department suggested just feed orange juice and regular food and all will be well. He was fucking wrong because his knowledge was outdated. 
Just because you are a simpleton doesn’t mean the world is simple. 
Why don’t you revert to simple techniques of homemade remedies and drink your own piss every morning(ppl actually do this btw). It boosts the immune system and you will be fine. Don’t need no vaccines or modern medicine for the likes of you. Too bad you wouldn’t be interested in k owing about the lives of polio survivors who are hobbled and in intense pain from a young childhood.

<p>Guessed you must have missed that bit of news Mr. I&#39;m So Smart, Modern, and Sophisticated.  </p>

<p>Now 3.3 billion dollars has been paid out to families with children who have been permanently injured by vaccines they received and there was no doubt whatsoever about those vaccines being the direct cause of those debilitating injuries to what were otherwise normal and healthy children before that happened to them. &quot;It didn&#39;t happen to you, so probably it doesn&#39;t exist.&quot; you smarmy little weasel.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a causal connection between mercury and aluminum in vaccines and the rapid rise in autism in children and early onset dementia in adults with both of those groups in particular being pushed to get the flu shot every year despite how ineffectual they are.</p>

<p>All of the recent outbreaks of measles and mumps that been reported have occurred not in any unvaccinated individuals but in ones that all had been inoculated against them just for good measure. </p>

<p>They also had a longer and more difficult recovery than anyone who isn&#39;t vaccinated at all typically encounters with those diseases and who actually will be permanently immune from ever getting them again. </p>

<p>The more you look the more questions and doubts that continually arise concerning vaccine efficacy and safety and there is a concerted and well organised effort to try to cover-up and deny that there are any real dangers or real problems due to them. There are all kinds of them and they are growing worse by the day.</p>

<p>Now you can swallow (ingest) snake venom and provided that you have no open cuts or lesions in your mouth you won&#39;t come to any harm otherwise you&#39;ll get seriously poisoned.  The same thing applies to any minor cut or wound you might get that venom in.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be necessary to have this point raised if we weren&#39;t talking about the known &quot;poisons&quot; in vaccines being compared to levels of them that can be safely ingested and not getting them directly under the skin and rupturing tissues and blood vessels in the process. </p>

<p>OK, so tell me what the safe level of ingestion is for the specific poisonous substances within vaccines you have in mind. You&#39;re kinda just rambling off your rocker at this point. </p>

<p>You are groping blindly around a valid point, that how you encounter something can impact toxicity, but none of this has legs on its own. Pick an ingredient, tell me what level it is safe to eat it at and then tell me what level it is safe to have injected in your deltoid. </p>

<p>That&#39;s cool. You can do that. I wouldn&#39;t recommend <em>you</em> get the vaccine, or me. But if you were a country with a low quality of life where the chance of you living where a minute component of 0.5mL vaccine is an issue, then that obviously changes the risk-reward equation. </p>

<p>In any case, the contents of these and other vaccines will not have any impact on your health. The beer I had yesterday is worse for me than getting any vaccine.</p>

<p>This is what I worked on back in 2003, I went into engineering after that. Today, I do work in combustion chemistry particularly in modeling radical species propagation, and internal combustion engine thermodynamics, specifically running LES CFD. Before that I did a lot of validations engineering for NOAA equipment, I learned a lot of thermodynamics and aerodynamics there. My real passion is cars though, I own my own shop and build and tune them. I also do independent contracting for major manufacturers, mostly in motor sports.</p>

If you would have said vaccination industry is milking humans for money, like other industries, I would have been on your side.

<p>Have you ever looked into the death rates from any of the normal childhood diseases in North America from 1900 to the present?</p>

<p>Vaccines prevent illnesses and deaths. Take a gander at the sequelae of measles, polio, diptheria, and so on and then come back and chide us about death rates. People on a ventilator aren&#39;t dead from polio but, damn, they&#39;re still on a ventilator.</p>

<p>Show me a graph about infection rates dropping off a cliff that <em>doesn&#39;t</em> coincide with a vaccine release and then we can talk.

<p>Symptoms
Most people who get infected with poliovirus (about 72 out of 100) will not have any visible symptoms.
About 1 out of 4 people with poliovirus infection will have flu-like symptoms that may include—
Sore throat
Fever
Tiredness
Nausea
Headache
Stomach pain
These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days then go away on their own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok so 74% of people show no symptoms 25% show mild flu like symptoms that go away on their own after a few days. Out of that 1% who experience serious symptoms only 1 in 200 become paralyzed. So one in 200 out of 1% of people with polio will have any serious side effects. More people are born with microcephaly yearly.</p>

<p>Fantasy. No evidence provided means it&#39;s just bullshit.</p>

<p>Lives are only worth saving because pharmaceutical companies can&#39;t collect money from dead people.</p>

<p>As far as what people dying means to me, sucks, but what are you gonna do. If you want to live in filth and eat shit, and not take care of your body, I can&#39;t feel bad for you if you die from easily preventable diseases. You made your bed, now sleep in it.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t feel bad for people who spent all their time partying doing drugs and making bad health choices. They did that all on their own, and since no one listens to me anyway I&#39;d be wasting my breath. All I can do is be the change I want to see.</p>

<p>so, if you got fired from your job for excessive tardiness, you&#39;d be confused as to what you did wrong, because you don&#39;t understand why the work day should start at the same time every day?</p>

<p>vaccines are a relatively new form of quackery that are only about 200 years old, whereas humans and other species have been successfully evolving for millions of years without vaccine quackery</p>

<p>if you were as scientifically literate as you assume you are, would you still believe that vaccines are safe and effective? </p>

<p>if so, why? please be specific. </p>

<p>please cite sources that actually contain evidence, as opposed to platitudes and talking points </p>

<p>how does my refusal to vaccinate put you at risk? </p>

<p>because you know down deep that your vaccine didn&#39;t actually work?</p>

<p>oh, let me guess...</p>

<p>you have a legitimate medical reason for not vaccinating, and you rely on other people to get vaccinated so you don&#39;t have to?</p>

<p>right, and if those people had not died of measles, they likely would have lived a horrible life of poor heath due to a dysfunctional immune system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My two sons (1 and 3) were both vaccinated.  I am not against vaccination, but I think the schedule that is imposed is too early.  This is my own personal observation, but my oldest son was developing normally, then he had his vaccinations and soon after started having difficulties with speech, comprehension and delayed walking.  He was behind other kids by about 6 months to a year.    My youngest son, we delayed his vaccine schedule by about 6 months, even though we received reminders to have vaccinated.   So long story short, in my personal opinion, it’s not a good idea to inject vaccines into a baby who’s brain is still developing.  Delay the vaccination schedule if you can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bad idea.  Do NOT delay vaccinations.  Vaccines prevent highly-contagious diseases from doing permanent damage.</p>

<p>My thoughts - your baby was going to develop those speech issues regardless of whether or not he was vaccinated.  The only reason you think the vaccines caused the issue is timing - he just happened to develop the issue after getting vaccinated.  This is why people used to think certain vaccines caused autism, the timing.  They would give these kids a vaccine right before the first signs of autism become apparent, so, they drew a false conclusion based on timing.</p>

Why should parents look at your comment as a glimpse into what to do with respect to vaccines? It&#39;s a tough pill to swallow but the connection you&#39;ve made in your mind with vaccines and your son is not necessarily the truth. And there&#39;s a lot of science out there that disagrees. Your son may be delayed developmentally, but he was dealt the best defense he can get for a host of pathogens he never had to deal with. I know several autistic people and while, of course, it&#39;s a spectrum, autism is hardly a nightmare on its own. When you cut down the big killers the only thing left looks like a giant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Propaganda? No. This seems like propaganda to you because you don’t understand it. Rather than try to educate yourself you’re using your lack of education to justify rejecting these FACTS.  Let me show you an example of what I mean:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7:00 &quot;could not find evidence that the MMR vaccine causes autism&quot; (for some reason they must not have bothered to ask any of the multitude of parents who can give them example after example)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this means that a study of vaccinated and non-vaccinated children could not prove a link between vaccines and autism. How did they come to this conclusion? They probably studied hundreds, maybe thousands of children, they counted how many kids were normal and how many kids were autistic, and there wasn’t enough evidence to say “vaccines increase your chance of autism”.  That means the autism rates in vaccinated and non-vaccinated children were so close that they couldn’t draw any conclusions from the data. </p>

<p>Now, let’s talk about what you just said, and why your criticism here means nothing.  When you say “they must not have bothered to ask any of the multitude of parents who can give them example after example,” what exactly are you saying? Are you suggesting that individual parents who BELIEVE (but have no proof) their child became autistic from vaccines are more reputable than the doctors and scientists who spent years studying this?  How many THOUSANDS of children do they have to include in their study before you find their correlations believable?  Why do you trust random schmucks more than educated medical professionals?</p>

At least 1 out of every 150 children and getting steadily worse. A crisis of huge proportions by comparison.</p>

<p>This steadily increasing number of children not born with it but afflicted by a condition <em>from some exterior source</em> that produces a condition virtually identical to it directly coincides with the ever expanding number of vaccines being mandated and given to children. </p>

<p>Vaccines that are known to contain &quot;neurotoxins&quot; that will invariably damage some part of anyone&#39;s nervous system including the brain that is almost completely composed of nervous tissue.</p>

<p>There can be very little doubt that what has happened to those children is not only a completely new phenomenon that is steadily increasing but that the incidence of it has grown apace with the ever expanding vaccine schedule. It&#39;s too big of a coincidence for anyone to be in a state of denial especially when the CDC itself has admitted in documents made public that the neurotoxins in the vaccines risk reducing any child&#39;s IQ by at least 10 points due to the damage they cause, which they considered to be &quot;worth it&quot; for the immunity they believe the vaccines provide.</p>

<p>None of that is true.  You show me one source that claims a child went through normal development until 6 years of age and I’ll show you how that source is biased or just wrong.  Autism symptoms usually show up before 2 years of age.</p>

<p>Autism can&#39;t be diagnosed in newborns.  The first symptoms of autism (delayed speech, developmental issues, etc.) can appear around 1.5 years.  In a newborn, the only way to prove they have an autism spectrum disorder is to dissect the brain postmortem because autistic brains develop differently during pregnancy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Children that never developed normally right from the very get-go. That&#39;s &quot;autism&quot; and what has historically been called autism until only very recently.</p>

<p>...not really.  Autistic children appear totally normal for the first 1-2 years.  They&#39;re identical to other babies.  You cannot diagnose autism in a newborn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no such thing as any normal and healthy child rapidly and suddenly losing all the developmental skills they&#39;d already acquired during the first six years of life in the medical records prior to the last fifty years.</p>

<p>Show me this.  Show me one case where a child reached age 6 before developing autism.  Give me a link, any sort of proof.  Literally anything.  <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/autism/conditioninfo/symptoms-appear">The scientific community agrees that symptoms appear by age 1-2 and diagnosis usually occurs after age 3 when symptoms are more apparent.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are, however, plenty of accounts in the prior medical literature of poisoning with toxic metals and chemicals that have done just that to any number of children and adults as well</p>

<p>Yes, poisoning a child with heavy metals can cause brain issues.  That has nothing to do with vaccines or autism though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now there is no explanation being officially offered besides referring to these other cases as &quot;autism&quot; and including a wide range of such rapid onset neurological disorders and claiming that they must somehow be genetic in their origins although there is still no definitive genetic cause that is know even for the children that are actually born that way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah we&#39;re still working on determining if it&#39;s a genetic component that gets activate during pregnancy, or if it&#39;s the result of some type of exposure to something during pregnancy, etc. we&#39;re studying shit that happens during pregnancy and fetal development, not after birth, because autism is something that happens to you during fetal development.</p>

<p>This is likely due to the increase in senior population.  Our healthcare is better than ever, people live to be older, so we have more senile people in general.</p>

It&#39;s about everyone you can infect that fire some reason are unable to get vaccinated due to circumstances instead of by choice. Your selfish choice could cause their misfortune. But you don&#39;t care. Somebody told you that it causes autism so better safe than sorry right? God forbid churches denounce vaccinations in small towns and oddly enough whooping cough outbreaks occur but lord all mighty somebody told them vaccinations give people autism. Can all those children who have to suffer and potentially die due to an entire communities negligence. This very subject pisses me off but you know what really jerks my chain?? Selfish people like yourself who continue to spread this backwards campaign of misinformation and anti science. It truly is shameful. </p>

<p>Do you know what a &quot;true vaccine&quot; like the one for small-pox was?

That there was nothing synthetic or artificial about it, no toxic metals or poisons like formaldehyde in that skin scratch. </p>

<p>No dead monkey or chicken tissue, DNA, and unknown viruses common to them but not to humans that the vast majority of those that have been introduced have all been cultivated in?</p>

<p>High Cortisol Symptoms
The symptoms of too much cortisol develop gradually and mostly overlap with many other conditions and include[1-3]:
Depression
Fatigue
Weight gain, especially in the face, upper back (“buffalo hump”), and torso
Obesity, especially abdominal obesity/central obesity
Back pain
Thin skin
Decreased concentration
Swelling in the hands and feet
Low libido
Acne
Impaired memory (especially short term)
Female facial hair or female balding
Insomnia
Poor skin healing
Irritability
Menstrual abnormalities
Blood sugar dysregulation/high blood sugar
Decreased bone mineral density
High blood pressure
Easy bruising
Muscle wasting and weakness of arms and legs
Reddish purple streaks on skin
What Causes High Cortisol Symptoms?
Rarely, having too much cortisol is caused by Cushing disease—a hormone-secreting tumor of the adrenal gland. More often, however, high cortisol is caused by prescription corticosteroid medications (including corticosteroid injections into the joints).[4]
Even more commonly, too much cortisol is caused by chronic stress. Chronic stress dysregulates the body’s stress response system (the hypothalamic–pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis). The HPA axis is a critical physiological system that mediates responses to all types of physical and psychological stress. When that stress is chronic, the delicate feedback system that is the HPA axis becomes damaged.[5] This can result in chronically high cortisol levels and lead to high cortisol symptoms.
Certain conditions are well known to cause the types of chronic physical and psychological stress that damage the HPA axis and lead to high cortisol levels. These conditions, which are often associated with high cortisol symptoms, include[6]:
Depression
Panic disorder
Generalized anxiety disorder
Posttraumatic stress disorder
Anorexia nervosa
Bulimia nervosa
Alcoholism
Diabetes mellitus
Severe obesity
Metabolic syndrome
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
Shift work
End-stage kidney disease
Major life stressors
Chronic pain</p>

<p>So no, this isn&#39;t accurate.  </p>

<p>The reason Polio is such a great vaccine is because the guy who invented it gave it away for free. No big pharma involvement whatsoever.</p>

<p>The reason I don&#39;t trust the flu vaccine is because the flu is too mutagenic and I don&#39;t trust big pharma to have any goal other than to try and make as much money as possible. If someone paid them enough to fuck up their vaccines to kill people, I would expect them to do that (as long as they were paid enough ie: if they do get caught than the legal fees would be far less than the extra money they made kind of calculation). </p>

<p>This is what I worked on back in 2003, I went into engineering after that. Today, I do work in combustion chemistry particularly in modeling radical species propagation, and internal combustion engine thermodynamics, specifically running LES CFD. Before that I did a lot of validations engineering for NOAA equipment, I learned a lot of thermodynamics and aerodynamics there. My real passion is cars though, I own my own shop and build and tune them. I also do independent contracting for major manufacturers, mostly in motor sports.</p>

<p>correct, polio was not as bad as the establishment hyped it to be</p>

<p>kinda like those WMDs that were used to sell a war</p>

<p>vaccines literally cause idiots. i would strongly suggest you lay off the vaccines, lest your brain damage becomes even worse CPTSD </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You guys cannot be convinced by logic. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>logic says that injecting aluminum, mercury, peanut oil and DNA into a baby is not preventative health care, its child abuse </p>

<p>but, since your brain has already been addled by vaccines, i don&#39;t expect you to understand this </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Smallpox vaccine didn’t cure smallpox</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there is absolutely no evidence that the small pox vaccine eradicated pox. </p>

<p>&quot;correlation doesn&#39;t always quell causation&quot;</p>

<p>you know what actually eradicated small pox? </p>

<p>my prayers!</p>

<p>theres as much evidence that my prayers eradicated small pox as there is that the small pox vaccine eradicated small pox</p>

<blockquote>
<p>autism didn’t exist before</p>
</blockquote>

<p>before Rubella vaccination, autism was caused by the highly unlikely chin of events whereby a pregnant woman was infected by Rubella, and her child went on to develop CRS, and then went on to develop ASD</p>

<p>today, we bypass the natural but highly unlikely Rubella-CRS route, and instead go with the more common, man-made route and induce ASD directly with MMR vaccine</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you are a whack job. At least be honest to yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you obviously do not know anything about vaccines, or the side effects of vaccines</p>

<p>you obviously do not know anything about the DSM either</p>

<p>perhaps you should keep your mouth shut until you understand what you are talking about? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you would bother to do some real research into the criticisms of vaccines, you&#39;d be amazed at the amount of quackery and fraud you&#39;d find</p>

<p>everything you think you know about vaccines came from consuming unsolicited vaccine propaganda </p>
