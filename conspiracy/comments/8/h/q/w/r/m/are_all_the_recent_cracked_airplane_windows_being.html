<p>Also, for the second plane the plastic window on the inside of the plane cracked, not the outside window (they are dual pane)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only familiar with C130 windows but they are glass (Lockheed has the contract and the use water white glass). Usually highly transmissive and anti-reflective coated. They are made to cycle through high temperatures and stresses. I figure commercial aircraft are similar. </p>

<p>I doubt energy weapons would mess with the glass. Maybe they would destroy the AR coatings since they are tuned to the visible wavelength. The weapons are used to target engines and such not windows even if you tried to laze the aircrews eyes the windows would just pass the beam. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is in reference to the jet blue front panels they are probably the same kind of glass. The windows along the cabin would not need to be built to the same requirements and may include acrylic layers. </p>

<p>In my 2500+ flight hours I saw three different window sections shatter. In one case it was a straight up bird strike. In one other during the mx debrief the aircraft suffered a bird strike on a previous flight so we figured it was related. The other was not known and was attributed to lifetime/stress reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this wiki should be a post on its own! WTF they also called it &quot;Teslas Earthquake Machine,&quot; this means it was common knowledge among those in the know. This will definitely make me question all future/past earthquakes.
