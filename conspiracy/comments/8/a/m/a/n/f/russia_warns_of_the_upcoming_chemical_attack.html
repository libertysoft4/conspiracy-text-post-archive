    <div class="md"><p>Possibility but let&#39;s think this rationally. </p>

<p><em>Russian knew Assad was going to use and they announced it to the world.</em> Why? The Russians are backing Assad so why would they want to frame him? What are they going to get out of this? What&#39;s the motive? Who benefits?</p>

<p><em>Next possibility is Russia did this.</em> What would they get out of gassing civilians who they are helping to protect? Recent news that Russia helped civilians escape rebel held area. Why would they want to help them escape only to gas others?</p>

<p><em>Another possibility is US did it with help of white helmets.</em> There were reports that US was supplying chemical weapons to rebel for them to use against civilians. Why does US want to gas the people? Who benefits?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In regards to your first question, I don’t think announcing it early would frame Assad. I think the idea would be to exonerate him. The claim is that it will be a false flag, meaning it will be attributed to someone who isn’t responsible, in this case Assad. </p>

<p>Considering Russia has spent money defending Assad. I don&#39;t understand that why would they want him gone now? If they really wanted Assad blamed, they wouldn&#39;t have gotten involved in the first place. Would you spent $1000 for something you don&#39;t want? I wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>You see I don&#39;t believe any country is without a plan in Syria. Russia is playing games and so is the west. I&#39;m just trying to understand the situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think you understand the meaning of exonerate. It means to absolve him of any blame in the situation. What I’m saying is that they’re claiming this would be carried out by a third party with the intention of making it look like Assad, when he really wouldn’t be involved. Russia is warning people that someone is going to try to make Assad look bad but Russia doesn’t want us to buy it. Is that more clear?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much exactly what I meant. Put it this way: we know nothing so far about an attack that hasn&#39;t happened yet, and with very worldly players who have various reasons to do such a thing and capabilities too, this Russian warning is useless.</p>
