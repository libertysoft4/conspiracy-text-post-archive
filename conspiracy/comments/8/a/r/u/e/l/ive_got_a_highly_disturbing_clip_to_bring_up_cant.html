        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You can find the whole show on Comcast on demand, but clips are hard to find.  There was one on YouTube that didn&#39;t do it justice cuz it was cropped and edited for copyright and had commentary;</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/CP24tX-bFNk">https://youtu.be/CP24tX-bFNk</a></p>

<p>This aired last Friday night. There was a segment right before where there was a fake call in to the show where a pizza shop owner was accosting will ferrel for a tip and will ferrel was like I didn&#39;t order one pizza I ordered 100. Then they were talking about babies and the guy on the phone goes &quot;there&#39;s no babies in this pizza shop&quot; and hangs up the phone. Clearly envoking pizzagate. Anyway I highly encourage you to watch this actual satanic ceremony on television. But never to watch the show again, as all this ritual was about is increasing their numbers.</p>

<p>Like seriously this is sick shit under the guise of a joke, but there is no punchline. They cover him in turtles blood and throw dirt on him which in nature is mocking God as the turtle and bastardizind Adam as the clay figure. I&#39;m not even a religious person, but I see the evil of this world practice the antithesis and it becomes clear to me to see they are trying to mock god. And that shit don&#39;t fly.</p>

<p>Thoughts? As I leave you with this pic of willy at an abramovic occulitst dinner. THIS IS NOT ART.</p>

<p><strong>“Marina! What place do you see the occult having within contemporary art; can magick be made (not simply appropriated/ performed)? Thanks, K”</strong>

“Everything depends on which context you are doing what you are doing. If you are doing the occult magic in the context of art or in a gallery, then it is the art. If you are doing it in different context, in spiritual circles or private house or on TV shows, it is not art. The intention, the context for what is made, and where it is made defines what art is or not.”*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its comedy. Anyone that doesn&#39;t get the joke, is because the joke is about them. It is making fun of people that will believe absolutely anything. Specifically, this particular kind of humour may be considered what is known as anti-comedy (comedy where there is no punchline or obvious joke). There are plenty of REAL conspiracies. This is not one of them in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it: Why would they send anyone over for damage control? If you really believe they are *Satanist&quot; doing black magic rituals and have super powers, wouldn&#39;t they just put a spell on you, or whomever was trying to &quot;out&quot; them? Send some demons around to take care of business for them? Use magic to shut down the internet? No, because none of this real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off yes, look at your account they would send some one over for damage control. You got his official reddit playing damage control. Clearly I&#39;ve struck a nerve and couldn&#39;t be happier. Secondly their magick is not very good that&#39;s why they give up themselves for power. Dude, you&#39;re Probablly in nyc working for gethard right now?</p>

<p>TruTV posted a clip of the episode today, and it&#39;s getting massive negative feedback. Almost all comments are talking about how it&#39;s occult and fucked up, and it&#39;s disliked at a high percentage.</p>

<p>Fuck this prick. Can&#39;t believe he came into this thread trying to defend that garbage</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All those that hid the true knowledge of the universe and attempt to control those they consider lesser are evil. What your namesake did was evil. The capstone can only levitate because its being held up on the mass of the unknowing. If the people were to be enlightened there would be no extra magick bullshit and you would lose all your power and control and that frightens you. We the people demand equality. And you know we can&#39;t have that for your needs, therefor you and will and marina, and all you baby rapers &quot;namesakes&quot; are an enemy to the future and I&#39;m enjoying watching you all fall. </p>
