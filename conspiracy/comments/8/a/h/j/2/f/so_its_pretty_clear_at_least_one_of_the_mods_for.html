<p>So its pretty clear at least one of the mods for this sub is Russian...... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hardly possible, because we&#39;re all either British or American. </p>

<p>In my case, (since it was me who stickied the current post calling into question the UK government&#39;s narrative on the Salisbury poisonings) I am British. I have no Russian ancestry, I don&#39;t speak Russian, never been to Russia, no financial relationship with any organisation connected to, or acting on behalf of Russia. Can I be any more unequivocal?</p>

<p>So, many of my posts on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have been critical of the British government. You&#39;re obviously new here because anyone who contributes regularly to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> who believes their own government is immune from criticism doesn&#39;t understand what this sub is really about. And in the case of the Salisbury poisonings, I would add that my position is in no sense &quot;pro-Russian&quot; - I am essentially criticising the UK government for attributing blame for these poisonings without having to hand the evidence to back up their accusations. </p>

<p>As this fiasco has unravelled, it is has become clear that Theresa May and Boris Johnson have made a monumental cock-up. They went all-in with their flimsy narrative of Russian state involvement without considering what would happen if the anyone demanded to see the evidence - because they clearly, and embarrassingly, don&#39;t have any.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, there was no diplomatic fall-back position in case things went wrong. The UK government is now horribly exposed, with no way of back-tracking without loss of face. This shit-show has been one of the most inept displays of international diplomacy by a British government in my lifetime, and as a Brit, I expect better from my government. </p>

<p>Democrats do not like his policies, but they never like Republican policies... that&#39;s why they&#39;re Democrats. So what has Trump done that Bush Jnr, Bush Snr or Reagan didn&#39;t do?</p>

<p>Or is it just your default belief that all Republican presidents are &quot;divisive&quot; while Democrats are somehow &quot;inclusive&quot;?</p>

<p>How so? I&#39;m not bullshitting you about being buried by pro Russia users here. It&#39;s overwhelming at times. </p>

<p>There is all kinds of brigading that goes on here depending on different factors. For example when the subs visitors recently shot up to around 9,000 for a few days. That imo was probably due to an influx of users from TMOR that got involved in some inter sub spat.</p>

<p>Or, as another example. Look at any gun discussion thread. Always brigaded by libertarians that <em>love</em> to argue until the cows come home on that topic. Some of which probably don&#39;t visit conspiracy on the regular. </p>

<p>Why is it so hard to believe that during one of the biggest actual political conspiracies in the history of the United States there would be operatives online trying to muddy the waters? </p>

<p>See, this is a dishonest statement.  It obviously is <em>not</em> holding you back from spouting stuff non-stop.  How does it overwhelm you exactly?  </p>

<p>I would say ONE look at the politics sub tells you where the conspiracy really lies, and I would suggest that you go there if the &quot;alternate&quot; view bothers you so much on Russia.  I&#39;ll tell ya what, I&#39;m not pro-Russia or anti-Russia, but if don&#39;t think Russia is the devil on the politics sub, you will get downvoted into oblivion.<br/>
In essence, a constant brigade.  That&#39;s far weirder than a &quot;handful of moderators&quot; out of what, 22, that bother you.  </p>

<p>And that&#39;s the gist of it.  You really don&#39;t have a consistent message, it&#39;s just casting aspersion on everything about this sub...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you could make an argument for which came first. while i know there has been some form of currency throughout civilization on the whole, the wealthy families were still beholden to their culturally specific regions, before govt, there were religious orders. For example, the pharoahs were seen as Gods, not in regards to the jewels we dug out of the soil to lay at their feet, but because of the knowledge they squirreled away and the political integration of aforementioned familial lines into Rome. The lineages through time have acquired their wealth by being able to manipulate the power systems. Their wealth can pay the people to move the mountains, but it can&#39;t actually lift them itself.

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve been critical of the mods plenty here, but I’m going to quibble with your point a little. Both the posts have been well sourced and relevant, and thus I do feel belong as stickies. I do wish we had seen so more conspiracies go up as stickies during this time, no just these, but I don’t really have a problem with them as much as the lack of diversity in content of the stickies over the last 3 weeks. </p>

<p>Which is why we need more Russian involved in online discussions, because the poles have reversed and now America has become an EMPIRE of LIES, and Russian&#39;s are the oppressed underdogs who&#39;re telling the Truth, only few of us can see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They had to impose the sanctions for optics and it most likely didn&#39;t stem from Trump himself. I highly doubt Trump even understands the full dynamic of what&#39;s going on in Syria. </p>

<p>The office really is above Trump. He doesn&#39;t have the capacity or desire to understand the global power dynamic or even basic civics. He&#39;s an empty suit. His divisiveness alone is exactly why he&#39;s there and you bet your ass Putin loves to see the American public at each others throats. </p>
