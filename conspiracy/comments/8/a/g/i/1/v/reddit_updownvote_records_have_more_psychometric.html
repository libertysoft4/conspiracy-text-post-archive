        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m going to make the argument that an individual&#39;s up/downvote behavior tells you more about they&#39;re psychological makeup than nearly any other platform. This is the real value of reddit. </p>

<p>Twitter and Facebook are more tied to identity, but also have some degree of pseudo-anonymity. Users like and share and retweet publicly, so it shows the face the user chooses to show. With reddit, the votes are confidential (to other users at least) and the accounts are less tied to identity (at least overtly), so people are much more comfortable expressing their true opinions about posts or comments, because they&#39;re less worried about what other people think they think. Consequently, the behavior is more indicative of the person&#39;s underlying psychic life. </p>

<p>If I had access to reddit&#39;s backend, and took a list of all the posts and comments a user has upvoted, downvoted, or hidden, I would know a lot about that user. For a moderately active reddit user, especially lurkers who vote often, I would have thousands if not tens of thousands of opinions that person either agreed or disagreed with. With machine learning on this data, I would be able to predict all sorts of things about this person: their politics, their religion, their interests, their temperament or disposition, their preferences and views, down to some pretty specific detail. </p>

<p>This would give me a very accurate psychological profile on a user, far more useful than anything Cambridge Analytica came away with, I&#39;d say at least an order of magnitude. And no one&#39;s even talking about what&#39;s happening with this data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I know. Reddit is getting people to willingly fill out psychological questionnaires about a very broad range of topics that capture their interest, and people are doing it for free. The questionnaires CA got a hold of were primitive compared to this. </p>

<p>I guess I&#39;ve always known this, but the realization is just now hitting me how much information and <em>knowledge</em> this actually provides. With a massive corpus of preferential data about each user, and the whole dataset about all the users in the system, the machine learning implications are huge. You can apply filters to cancel out noise or filter out bots from the dataset; recognize common or unique patterns on narrow or broad scales; predict affinity for certain pieces of content for either individuals or sets of individuals; and in combination with entities, you could match this specific psychological data with the user&#39;s identity. The possibilities are nearly endless. </p>

<p>Reddit is the perfect petri dish for studying how ideas, how memes in the original Dawkinsian sense, actually propagate and mutate across the network. There have been academic studies done on reddit content, but those are just scratching the surface, as all the vote data was anonymized. If the owners and partners of reddit are smart with how they use this data, and can keep the knowledge that they have this data away from the users, they are sitting on an absolute goldmine. </p>

<p>I just wonder who&#39;s using it and to what ends. </p>

<p>Whoever <strong>actually owns</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publishing</a> (they own Conde Nast) - someone whose name is not even on the internet... and probably for use by another company they own or someone they know owns - that traffics in sorting users into 3+ categories of &quot;risk&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt it&#39;s any one person or entity; it&#39;s the entire bureaucracy in a way. Sure, some factions likely have more access to the data than others, but it all gets used for the same control program. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think levels of risk is also just scratching the surface. This is multi-dimensional analysis that can know more about you than you or your closest friends know about you. And with unstructured machine learning, they can find patterns they never would have thought to look for and answers to questions they never asked. </p>

<p>The practical applications are far-reaching: Microtargetting of individuals for advertising or propaganda purposes far more accurate and precise than CA, learning what levels techniques of propaganda individuals and populations are susceptible to (e.g. testing the waters for BlueBeam or similar), gauging and molding popular understanding nearly any aspect of society. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, I see cynical, flippant, and negative comments do very well if they agree with that subculture&#39;s general positions: for example, cynical or mocking comments about Trump in r/politics or most other subs do well, as do cynical or mocking comments about Clinton or the deep state in subs like here or T_D.

<p>Most reddit users never give this a thought. So you&#39;ve got zero awareness which makes the data very useful. </p>

<p>There&#39;s <a href="https://snoopsnoo.com/">a tool</a> that you can use that does exactly this kind of analysis, but in a limited way. My guess is that there is data somewhere about user&#39;s activity that could be analyzed 6 ways from Sunday.</p>

<p>It&#39;s supposed to be for checking out your own account, but I&#39;ve used it on occasion to check out potential shills. One really useful feature is the word-cloud analysis.</p>

<p>This one shows you which words a user uses most often. It&#39;s not quite mind-reading, but it&#39;s not that far off either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, snoopsnoo is kind of cool, and using the API (and a 3rd party database called pushshift) you can get even more data and run what ever kind of analysis you want on it. But the votes themselves are completely hidden from the public unless you specifically make them public. That data is only known to reddit anyone they share it with. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Knowing the votes is even closer to true mind reading, because you can also measure a user&#39;s affinity to certain words, topics, ideas, positions, and interests. Most users vote orders of magnitude more than they comment or post. </p>

<p>I&#39;m considering writing a script that can go back through and unvote for every post/comment I&#39;ve voted on, but I imagine there are limitations on how far back it goes, and reddit might also keep the historical data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the best explanation I&#39;ve seen of the true ability to monetize, and in my opinion weaponize, reddit.  People are rage quitting facebook because they believe their privacy was violated by a few ads and finding their political affiliation in their user profile.  Meanwhile, reddit has as good, maybe even better, a profile of you than buyer rewards and credit card data.  You don&#39;t buy everything you want a store where you have a buyer rewards card, say,  but you can upvote or downvote for free. </p>

<p>The monetary value aside, I am certain somewhere the CIA,  FBI, NSA, some three letter agency has done this already. I used to think the three letters crawled the site with a keyword algorithm, which they do, but this upvote downvote data is far easier to analyze and paints a better picture.  Some people are well versed in English, others not so, but upvotes and downvotes are a simple binary 0 or 1.  </p>

<p>If one of these agencies has access to the actual vote data, it would have to be because either reddit gave it to them (willingly or coerced), reddit fucked up seriously in their security practices, or HTTPS is compromised (which is possible). </p>

<p>The same with FB I think it&#39;s less that we lack real alternatives, or are addicted to this platform per se, but that so many people use this platform. If you want to communicate with people that use reddit, you pretty much have to use reddit at this point. Alternatives exist, but they just don&#39;t have the same reach. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t think Reddit sells that data for marketing research purposes?  It&#39;s been going on for years.  That&#39;s why you need to always use a VPN, always scrub your comments (over-write plus delete), and switch your username.</p>

<p>I&#39;d have to see how their backend is written, but this likely isn&#39;t enough, and if reddit isn&#39;t recording original comments, you can be sure 3rd parties are. As far as VPN and username switching, it will help against internet detectives, but one slip up from perfect infosec and a sufficiently determined adversary can connect you to all your accounts. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not particularly worried about this as far as it goes; I just use reddit with the knowledge that everything I&#39;m typing can and likely will be tied to me. Reddit is not and should not be thought of as an anonymous platform, which is more what I feel the takeaway should be. If you want real anonymity, onions and zeronode with appropriate precautions are the best bet, but even with that it&#39;s more security by obscurity than true security. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, no, no...I mean, you keep an account for a few months, then you scrub it and move on to a new account that had no associations with the old account and never go back to the old one.  That makes linking accounts together MUCH harder.  But it&#39;s not &quot;internet detective&quot; i.e. someone trying to dox you for what-ever reason you have to worry about, it&#39;s Reddit providing the info willingly to what-ever agency is asking for it (or even selling it to them).</p>

<p>Agree, it is likely that all your original comments are being logged somewhere, however, at one time, Reddit was open source and it was known that they only recorded the &quot;last edit&quot; on every comment.  Hence you over-write the comment with nonsense and then delete.  Who knows what is happening now?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I know what you meant, but I&#39;m saying even with that, a sufficiently motivated adversary could tie you to the accounts if you made any deviation from best security practices. At the very least, r/pushshift (ceddit backend) records every public comment in real-time, so unless you&#39;re scrubbing comments at the end of every month before it takes a final snapshot, those comments are tied to that username indefinitely, and publicly available. NSA and CIA are almost certainly saving <em>every</em> edit as well. </p>

<p>And as far as linking accounts, there are other statistical methods that used in conjunction could be pretty effective. If you&#39;re using a desktop browser, browser fingerprints are fairly effective at this. If you&#39;re using the official apps, they&#39;re almost certainly matching accounts to devices directly. If you&#39;re using a closed-source third-party app, you have no clue what they&#39;re doing with your data. Open source apps or third party API clients are probably the best bet, but the smaller userbase will make you stick out more. Voting patterns, patterns in usage time, linguistic patterns, etc. can also provide useful classification data. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t try to obscure your identity, but if NSA wants to identify you, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll have a hard time at it. I&#39;m just saying use the platform with that understanding. </p>

<p>At least any part of the internet that is not expressly focused on privacy, and maintained and audited by multiple independent parties with a vested interest in privacy.

    <div class="md"><p>I looked into it a while ago, and there are some best practices, but the detection methods are pretty good. Even something like having different fonts installed on your machine or different browser extensions represent a feature which can be used to narrow the pool of users with similar browsers. </p>

<p>Your best bet is to make your browser appear like a lot of other people&#39;s browsers. A fresh Windows 10 install with an up to date, barebones chrome is likely the best option, but not having adblock or ghostery/disconnect leaves you open to other attack vectors. Anything you do hide yourself consequently puts you in a category of people trying to hide themselves, which narrows the pool, especially if you try to hide yourself in a different way than everyone else. I really think it&#39;s a crapshoot. </p>

<p>But I guess downloading webpages via <code>curl</code> in a *nix terminal and rendering your pages offline would work, but you won&#39;t have any javascript functionality, and most interactive sites like reddit would be mostly broken. </p>

<p>Yeah, probably, even in that combination there are probably hundreds of thousands if not millions of users. But then within that group, if you have noscript set to disable or enable a feature that a server can detect, that distinguishes you further within that group. There&#39;s a site somewhere that will tell you how unique your fingerprint is. You can probably tweak your set up and compare them to find something that minimizes your uniqueness profile. </p>

<p>For sure. I just picked chrome because it&#39;s by far the most popular, and therefore least unique, browser out there. Maybe Edge on Win10 is actually better just because it&#39;s completely stock, so you&#39;d be lumped in with a bunch of people who never touch their system. </p>

<p>There&#39;s so many tradeoffs that you have to weigh what makes the most sense for you, and which privacy concerns you want to prioritize over others (e.g. identifiability vs. data leakage vs. data theft). </p>
