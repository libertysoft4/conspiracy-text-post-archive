    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by political affinity? Anyone who has any beliefs about society has some sort of political affinity. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that- what&#39;s wrong is getting bogged down in the horse race and the us vs. them mentality. What&#39;s wrong is voting for someone just because they have an R or D next to their name. What&#39;s wrong is thinking that someone is mentally ill or subhuman because they have different political leanings. It&#39;s impossible to be apolitical without sacrificing the future of yourself and your country to others who would care more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ok to believe in a frame work of Left or Right- meaning that you subscribe to ideals or end games that would line up with those ideologies, roughly. It&#39;s bad to blindly follow any politician, especially considering that most politicians in the US today are Neolib/Neocon Corporatists. People shouldn&#39;t vote for someone just because they have an R or D next to their name, and they shouldn&#39;t trust what the Corporate Propaganda Media has to say about almost anything.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also important to remember that we&#39;re all People, and Citizens of this country. And that just because someone holds different political beliefs doesn&#39;t mean that they are &quot;mentally ill&quot; or &quot;deranged&quot;. That&#39;s what it means to fall into the trap- when you start believing that anyone who doesn&#39;t subscribe to your ideology is somehow lesser. It&#39;s important to remember that we all have different views and opinions on things- and that that is Ok! It&#39;s also important to remember that most people don&#39;t fit into perfect little boxes. As a personal example- I am someone who would be considered on the Left, yet I am also a gun Rights advocate.</p>

<p>This is a false logic. We all knew that Presidents were puppets. It&#39;s just that Trump is the most renegade, wild card puppet there is. You got to be kidding me if you think Obama had worse PR than Trump.</p>

<p>I mean shit.. Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize for being black. He&#39;s bombed the most people since Bush and Trump combined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, definitely not a false logic. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> used to question the president, now many here bend over backwards to defend him.</p>

<p>He may be promoting himself as a &quot;renegade, wild card&quot; but as you said he&#39;s definitely still a puppet. I think most of us here understand that, what&#39;s strange is how many go out of their way to defend him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I guess its just too much for people to be able to comprehend someone that makes their decisions on what they believe based off more than a d or r. Party loyalty vs voting for individuals is one of the biggest things wrong with our politics. And single issue voters.</p>

<p>And suppression of other voices. I used to be more libertarian until I decided corporations cant be trusted to do the right things like not poison people. Just because I decided regulation is needed and a free market economy isnt necessarily the best doesnt mean I also have to start wanting to take guns or that I need to support certain candidates.  </p>

<p>Knowing the presidents are all bought out is simply fact. An agenda to make one party better than the other is just party duality stupidity.</p>

<p>go after him for any of the stuff he&#39;s doing that is completely in line with what previous presidents have done.</p>

<p>This is a false logic. We all knew that Presidents were puppets. It&#39;s just that Trump is the most renegade, wild card puppet there is. You got to be kidding me if you think Obama had worse PR than Trump.</p>

<p>I mean shit.. Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize for being black. He&#39;s bombed the most people since Bush and Trump combined.</p>
