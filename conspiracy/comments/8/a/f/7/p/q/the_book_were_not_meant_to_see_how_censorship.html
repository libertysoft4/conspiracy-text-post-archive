        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">11</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-04-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/perfectionits.html">perfectionits</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In Sept 2014 this book was published in Germany: Gekaufte Journalisten (GJ) by Dr. Ulfkotte.</p>

<p>Also in Sept 2014, a new publisher was registered in Oakland, USA: Tayen Lane Publishing (<a href="http://www.tayenlane.com/">http://www.tayenlane.com/</a>)</p>

<p>Immediately after its founding, Tayen Lane bought the rights to the English translation of GJ. The English title is: &quot;Journalists for hire. How the CIA buys the news&quot;</p>

<p>2014-2015: GJ sells exceptionally well in Germany, despite having zero promotional budget, and to date has sold hundreds of thousands of copies and for three years remained near the top of several categories on amazon.de.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tayen Lane was holding back the English version.</p>

<p>January 2017 - The author dies of heart failure, at age 56.</p>

<p>May 2017 - Tayen Lane finally publishes the book in the US: 
 <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Journalists_for_Hire.html?id=rrITDAEACAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en">https://books.google.com/books/about/Journalists_for_Hire.html?id=rrITDAEACAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en</a></p>

<p>The only problem was, you still couldn&#39;t buy it. I tried, many times. &quot;Sorry, this book is currently unavailable&quot; was the error message you would get.</p>

<p>To this day, Tayen Lane has refused to sell the book, and has stonewalled any and all attempts to reach them (phone/email/letter). By early 2018 they had removed the book from their web-site. No trace remains.</p>

<p>For completeness, the book was offered on walmart.com for a short period. Walmart actually took my order, but cancelled it 3 months later without delivering. The book was &quot;out of stock&quot; even before it went on sale. Amazing.</p>

<p>Outright censorship is bad, of course, which is why Tayen Lane established &#39;plausible deniability&#39; by making a single hardcopy available on amazon.com. The price is only $996, with no return rights. Enjoy.</p>

<p>The book&#39;s topic is how our intelligence agencies control and shape the stories presented by our main media outlets. As it stands now, Tayen Lane itself serves as further proof of the importance and relevance of Dr. Ulfkotte&#39;s work.</p>

<p>For the record, I don&#39;t recommend buying any conspiracy books about Dr. Ulfkotte&#39;s early death. I see one has just popped up.
If anyone has information on what killed him they should share it for free, preferably with the police. No one should make money off his unfortunate end.</p>

<p>My main hope and motivation with this post is to one day be able to read the damn book. Any help with that would be greatly appreciated.
Another motivation is to highlight the problem of censorship. How many other &quot;inconvenient&quot; books are we not allowed to see?</p>

<p>&quot;Two Hundred Years Together&quot; by A. Solzhenitsyn - for some odd reason this book is stubborn, not wanting to be read by English speaking folk, nor sold in USA as a Translated readable book.</p>

<p>It should be a higher quality translation than anything else out there. I&#39;d be interested in what corroborating or contradicting information you find once you&#39;ve made some headway into the book.</p>

<p>Preface</p>

<p>Lsd? Crack? Holly Apple tea? Cocaine? Crystal meth? In view of the reporting of our quality media, one wonders more and more often which drugs are consumed in newsrooms. They don&#39;t seem to be that close anymore. What stir in the morning only in your cereal? Many journalists have obviously lost touch with reality. While millions of people out there do not know how to take on rising rents and food prices, certain journalists are looking for close proximity to those elites who are responsible for the suffering of more and more people. And while the EU can only delay state bankruptcies by means of pause-free money printing, our leading media, in the interests of the financial elite, are demanding the inclusion of other bankrupt crisis states in the EU. Too much crack? Too much LSD? Or is it due to cocaine in the editorial offices? While the citizens are fed up with the deaths of foreign missions, certain media representatives are steel helmeting and endorse Americans in the planning of new war missions. Are these the consequences of crystal meth?</p>

<p>At the same time, our alpha journalists have a total blackout. In any case, you may or might not want to remember today how you have written us the Iraq war or the Afghan mission with glorious words. As you first noticed the financial crisis and the Eurocrash, when every citizen was already suffering from the effects. And when a passenger plane crashed over Ukraine in 2014, they wanted to send our soldiers immediately to war against Russia, even before they even decided who was responsible for the crash. Prevent bloodshed by promoting more bloodshed – a killer principle. In Iraq alone, there are more than 100 000 dead civilians who died there because our media, with quite a few exceptions, had so frenetically cheered up the Iraq war in the hallucination frenzy. So who or what controls the lunatics in our lead media? Do they really take drugs? Or does systematic madness have completely different reasons? Do you have propaganda specialists in the background? In the past, this would certainly have been dismissed as a conspiracy theory. But today we know that journalists of renowned media are the main goal of spindoctors, who want to determine the power of interpretation over our news. In particular, the US governments and the Israelis are working like this. There are even manuals on how to influence quality media. 1 › Note It is clear: anyone working in reputable media should be extremely cautious about lobby groups, including American and Israeli. As we will see, certain journalists are doing exactly the opposite. They are manifestly sauwohl in the spider webs, especially American and Israeli influence groups. And they are also boasting, there</p>

<p>Preface Page 4
Page 9 PDF</p>

<p>... a book entitled The War Sellers: History of U.S. Propaganda 1917 – 2005 demonstrated how Americans influence our journalists. Surprisingly, his work (unfortunately) has largely gone down. But after that, the WikiLeaks documents were published. And anyone can easily search the Internet by using a WikiLeaks search engine for research 16 › how often certain key media are mentioned in the secret message dispatches by name, because of Proamerican reporting. It is noticeable that those who are obviously mentally close to the former occupying Power of the United States are hiding US-critical reporting. In Washington&#39;s interest? What are you doing?</p>

<p>The operators of the WikiLeaks Internet platform devote themselves to the task of making secret documents of all kinds accessible to the public. There was, among other things, a 2010 as» Confidential/NOFORN (US) «, i.e. confidential and classified as only accessible to US nationals for download. As its author chocolatier the» CIA red Cell «, a team of Secret Service learners, who are instructed by the CIA director in his own words to &quot;look beyond the Box&quot;, &quot;to stimulate thought&quot; and &quot;to offer alternative perspectives&quot;. And I found a document of the Spindoktoren in the US Secret Service entitled: Afghanistan: Sustaining West European support for the NATO-led mission – Why counting on Apathy might not be enough «. 17 › It was in the secret document that it was in the ranks of the Western European allies to provide support for the Nato war on the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan. The Western European public should be led by influence to tolerate the rising numbers of victims expected in the spring and summer of 2010, both in the ranks of their own soldiers and among the Afghan civilian population. For this, it was said that a tailor-made» Strategic communication programme «would be needed for the troop-contributing NATO countries. And this included Germany as well. The aforementioned secret document is nothing more than a prescription for influencing public opinion in the German-speaking world – issued by the CIA. Surprisingly, the CIA called for the necessary influence of the German public on the research of a transatlantic organization: the German Marshall Fund of the United States, as outlined in the secret document. He had found in polls that only about one percent of Germans felt the stabilisation of Afghanistan as the most important national goal. 18 › Note and that is exactly what should be changed. The German public was then covered with US propaganda through the leading media. With war propaganda.</p>

<p>Are such secret documents, as WikiLeaks has published, not reason enough for German leading media to be deprived of any suspicion of influence and propaganda by US organizations since then? If the CIA is already working out» Strategic communication programmes «for German-language media, then our» Quality Media «would have to make a big bow around those organizations that are in the environment</p>

<p>To keep Schilling. The bill for this today pays the citizen on the street, whose savings are dissolved before his eyes. Today, we all have to pay for the devastating financial consequences of this manipulation of opinion as well as for the financial crash that our leading media did not want to foresee in the constant champagne-cork mood on their economic sides. Only the then editor-in-chief of the Financial Times Deutschland, Lionel Barber, has publicly apologized to his readers for the fact that his hand has not understood or seen the financial crisis for a long time and has misinformed the public – Until every ordinary citizen on the street experienced the financial crisis. 27 › The Financial Times Germany, which publicly apologized for its misconduct, has now been discontinued, however.</p>

<p>We citizens now pay not only a high financial price for manipulation by the leading media. Even the toll is devastating. Because our leading media have a clear enemy: Russia. Bad Russian, good American, so the prevailing view. This is part of a psychological warfare (PsyOp). In the past, wars were waged by soldiers, today mainly through the media. Many people have recognized the hostility that is being transported by the media into our brains. Once respected newspaper editors such as the FAZ are now regularly given comments like» Smear Press «and» Disgusting war drivers «. 28 also the Austrian conflict researcher Dr. Kurt Gritsch accuses our bourgeois» Quality Newspapers «After extensive studies today to be» War drivers «. </p>

<p>He writes:</p>

<p>Do you like reading the newspaper? And if so, do you also belong to those who hold bourgeois quality sheets like &quot;Faz&quot;, &quot;NZZ&quot;, &quot;South German Zeitung&quot; or &quot;Time&quot; the bar? I confess: I do not belong to it. No more since I had to find out for many years that the journalistic preparation of war there has method. (...) This is war-driving and is also referred to as such. 29 ›</p>

<p>This agitation and war-driving was evident in historically unprecedented clarity after the crash of a civil passenger aircraft of Malaysia Airlines (flight MH-17) in mid-July 2014 in the east of Ukraine. The wreckage had barely touched the ground, as an opinion cartel already spread the» message «That Russia was responsible for it. In the psychological manipulation of the people at the very front: picture. » Does EU only stand for &#39; outrageously idle &#39;? &quot;asked the leaf days after the crash, claiming that a Moscow rocket killed 298 people, although at that time it was certainly not clear who owned the weapon used or who had been fired. 30 › Note Even American secret services said on that day that the image (and other German media) lamented the &quot;inaction&quot; of the EU towards Russia, that they had no proof that there was &quot;Russian participation&quot; in the plane crash. 31
     › Note Soon it was clear that the Americans, unlike our media</p>

<p>Preface</p>

<p>Lsd? Crack? Holly Apple tea? Cocaine? Crystal meth? In view of the reporting of our quality media, one wonders more and more often which drugs are consumed in newsrooms. They don&#39;t seem to be that close anymore. What stir in the morning only in your cereal? Many journalists have obviously lost touch with reality. While millions of people out there do not know how to take on rising rents and food prices, certain journalists are looking for close proximity to those elites who are responsible for the suffering of more and more people. And while the EU can only delay state bankruptcies by means of pause-free money printing, our leading media, in the interests of the financial elite, are demanding the inclusion of other bankrupt crisis states in the EU. Too much crack? Too much LSD? Or is it due to cocaine in the editorial offices? While the citizens are fed up with the deaths of foreign missions, certain media representatives are steel helmeting and endorse Americans in the planning of new war missions. Are these the consequences of crystal meth?</p>

<p>At the same time, our alpha journalists have a total blackout. In any case, you may or might not want to remember today how you have written us the Iraq war or the Afghan mission with glorious words. As you first noticed the financial crisis and the Eurocrash, when every citizen was already suffering from the effects. And when a passenger plane crashed over Ukraine in 2014, they wanted to send our soldiers immediately to war against Russia, even before they even decided who was responsible for the crash. Prevent bloodshed by promoting more bloodshed – a killer principle. In Iraq alone, there are more than 100 000 dead civilians who died there because our media, with quite a few exceptions, had so frenetically cheered up the Iraq war in the hallucination frenzy. So who or what controls the lunatics in our lead media? Do they really take drugs? Or does systematic madness have completely different reasons? Do you have propaganda specialists in the background? In the past, this would certainly have been dismissed as a conspiracy theory. But today we know that journalists of renowned media are the main goal of spindoctors, who want to determine the power of interpretation over our news. In particular, the US governments and the Israelis are working like this. There are even manuals on how to influence quality media. 1 › Note It is clear: anyone working in reputable media should be extremely cautious about lobby groups, including American and Israeli. As we will see, certain journalists are doing exactly the opposite. They are manifestly sauwohl in the spider webs, especially American and Israeli influence groups. And they are also boasting, there</p>

<p>Preface Page 4

<p>... a book entitled The War Sellers: History of U.S. Propaganda 1917 – 2005 demonstrated how Americans influence our journalists. Surprisingly, his work (unfortunately) has largely gone down. But after that, the WikiLeaks documents were published. And anyone can easily search the Internet by using a WikiLeaks search engine for research 16 › how often certain key media are mentioned in the secret message dispatches by name, because of Proamerican reporting. It is noticeable that those who are obviously mentally close to the former occupying Power of the United States are hiding US-critical reporting. In Washington&#39;s interest? What are you doing?</p>

<p>The operators of the WikiLeaks Internet platform devote themselves to the task of making secret documents of all kinds accessible to the public. There was, among other things, a 2010 as» Confidential/NOFORN (US) «, i.e. confidential and classified as only accessible to US nationals for download. As its author chocolatier the» CIA red Cell «, a team of Secret Service learners, who are instructed by the CIA director in his own words to &quot;look beyond the Box&quot;, &quot;to stimulate thought&quot; and &quot;to offer alternative perspectives&quot;. And I found a document of the Spindoktoren in the US Secret Service entitled: Afghanistan: Sustaining West European support for the NATO-led mission – Why counting on Apathy might not be enough «. 17 › It was in the secret document that it was in the ranks of the Western European allies to provide support for the Nato war on the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan. The Western European public should be led by influence to tolerate the rising numbers of victims expected in the spring and summer of 2010, both in the ranks of their own soldiers and among the Afghan civilian population. For this, it was said that a tailor-made» Strategic communication programme «would be needed for the troop-contributing NATO countries. And this included Germany as well. The aforementioned secret document is nothing more than a prescription for influencing public opinion in the German-speaking world – issued by the CIA. Surprisingly, the CIA called for the necessary influence of the German public on the research of a transatlantic organization: the German Marshall Fund of the United States, as outlined in the secret document. He had found in polls that only about one percent of Germans felt the stabilisation of Afghanistan as the most important national goal. 18 › Note and that is exactly what should be changed. The German public was then covered with US propaganda through the leading media. With war propaganda.</p>

<p>Are such secret documents, as WikiLeaks has published, not reason enough for German leading media to be deprived of any suspicion of influence and propaganda by US organizations since then? If the CIA is already working out» Strategic communication programmes «for German-language media, then our» Quality Media «would have to make a big bow around those organizations that are in the environment</p>

<p>To keep Schilling. The bill for this today pays the citizen on the street, whose savings are dissolved before his eyes. Today, we all have to pay for the devastating financial consequences of this manipulation of opinion as well as for the financial crash that our leading media did not want to foresee in the constant champagne-cork mood on their economic sides. Only the then editor-in-chief of the Financial Times Deutschland, Lionel Barber, has publicly apologized to his readers for the fact that his hand has not understood or seen the financial crisis for a long time and has misinformed the public – Until every ordinary citizen on the street experienced the financial crisis. 27 › The Financial Times Germany, which publicly apologized for its misconduct, has now been discontinued, however.</p>

<p>We citizens now pay not only a high financial price for manipulation by the leading media. Even the toll is devastating. Because our leading media have a clear enemy: Russia. Bad Russian, good American, so the prevailing view. This is part of a psychological warfare (PsyOp). In the past, wars were waged by soldiers, today mainly through the media. Many people have recognized the hostility that is being transported by the media into our brains. Once respected newspaper editors such as the FAZ are now regularly given comments like» Smear Press «and» Disgusting war drivers «. 28 also the Austrian conflict researcher Dr. Kurt Gritsch accuses our bourgeois» Quality Newspapers «After extensive studies today to be» War drivers «. </p>

<p>He writes:</p>

<p>Do you like reading the newspaper? And if so, do you also belong to those who hold bourgeois quality sheets like &quot;Faz&quot;, &quot;NZZ&quot;, &quot;South German Zeitung&quot; or &quot;Time&quot; the bar? I confess: I do not belong to it. No more since I had to find out for many years that the journalistic preparation of war there has method. (...) This is war-driving and is also referred to as such. 29 ›</p>

<p>This agitation and war-driving was evident in historically unprecedented clarity after the crash of a civil passenger aircraft of Malaysia Airlines (flight MH-17) in mid-July 2014 in the east of Ukraine. The wreckage had barely touched the ground, as an opinion cartel already spread the» message «That Russia was responsible for it. In the psychological manipulation of the people at the very front: picture. » Does EU only stand for &#39; outrageously idle &#39;? &quot;asked the leaf days after the crash, claiming that a Moscow rocket killed 298 people, although at that time it was certainly not clear who owned the weapon used or who had been fired. 30 › Note Even American secret services said on that day that the image (and other German media) lamented the &quot;inaction&quot; of the EU towards Russia, that they had no proof that there was &quot;Russian participation&quot; in the plane crash. 31
     › Note Soon it was clear that the Americans, unlike our media</p>
