        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m curious as to what degree the users here still believe that our high level elected officials still make decisions and enact policies on their own, and act autonomously. </p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve always been under the impression that people in positions of immense power, like the presidency, were &quot;installed&quot; into those positions by the ruling class. </p>

<p>If you look at where the funding comes for most high elected officials, it comes from big banks, wall street firms, corporations, media, and wealthy individual billionaires. These are the same groups that the global crime syndicate consists of and is run by. Often, people from these same circles are placed into cabinet positions once their &quot;puppet&quot; is elected.</p>

<p>However, it&#39;s not enough just for this crime syndicate, to select a candidate that has agreed in advance to do their bidding; They need to select <em>two</em> candidates that signed on to the agenda, run them against each other, and that they can craft an entire scripted election narrative around. All they have to do is use their controlled media, to cover their two pre-selected candidates the most, and catapult them into the nominations of their party. Then, it&#39;s merely a scripted puppet show, with scripted debates, and scripted partisan tension and theatrics. Since they control both candidates and the media, they can shift the narrative and choose a different winner if they have to, by gauging what the public is thinking. </p>

<p>Once they&#39;ve selected a winner and he/she is elected, the candidate simply follows orders, carries out the policies the crime syndicate demands, passes the bills they want pass, and bombs the countries they want bombed. They can also order them to make a statement or say something controversial to stir the pot and create partisan division. </p>

<p>&quot;Say something offensive about *insert racial group here&quot;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>&quot;Tell conservatives that they didn&#39;t build their own businesses.&quot;</p>

<p>To my estimation, our elected officials at the highest levels have virtually no autonomy at the position, and are essentially instructed on what to do by their corporate oligarch masters, to better help form their vision of a world government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely lean toward this.</p>

<p>How would we interpret Trump election in light of this theory.  Was his win, despite HRC clearly being the darling of the media/TPTB just basically psyop?  I have a hard time not believing US elections are not horribly compromised so not sure what else to make of his victory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Retail politics is basically reality TV.</p>

<p>The real secret they don&#39;t want you to know is this:  your vote DOES matter.  It legitimizes what they do in office.  They&#39;ve already won the battle in America.  Only 50% of us turn out to vote for politicians who can receive up to 100% of their campaign funding by anonymous corporate donors.</p>
