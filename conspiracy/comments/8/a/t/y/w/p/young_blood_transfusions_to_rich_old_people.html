        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I live in a relatively low-income/urban shithole. A few months ago I noticed this place &#39;CSL PLASMA&#39; being opened in a mostly abandoned strip-mall down the road from me. I thought it was really strange that plasma donations were essentially &quot;going corporate&quot;. The posters/propaganda on the windows make me uncomfortable.</p>

<p>It made sense to me that they would put a place like this in a low-income area, as you can make &quot;up to $400&quot; donating plasma. </p>

<p>But with the recent &quot;trend&quot; of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/young-blood-transfusions-are-on-the-menu-at-society-gala/">young blood transfusions being on menus at society galas</a>, I can&#39;t help but think something creepier is going on.</p>

<p>Are your plasma donations really going to people who need it? (especially if done at some McPlasma place such as CSL Plasma), or is it being sold to rich, old people?</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It pays them, but tells them their plasma is going to sick kids and shit. Maybe some of it does, and some of it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I get what you&#39;re saying. A lot of the people who donate for the $$ don&#39;t care, they just need the money. But some people donate because they&#39;re under the illusion that they are helping people. It should be more transparent IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a csl plasma center where I lived in northern Minnesota that was strategically placed in a low income area as well. My roommates would go donate as much as they could (we were poor college kids). </p>

<p>I went to do it once and the whole thing was so fucking uncomfortable for me I never went back.</p>

<p>I kind of doubt their using it for &quot;young blood transfusions&quot; though. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s just a super cheap way for them to collect plasma, that they can re sell and make giant profits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many new treatments for very painful and rare ailments that require plasma to make or stem cell products . So I’m not surprised that the need worldwide grows . I received one of the stem cell type treatments mine was harvested at a live birth of a baby and then processed . Some of these can be life changing or life saving . I am not rich and am in my  early 40 ‘s . Most of the medical care is to right issues people suffer from this is why the need has grown for these products . The pain has been reduced enough I can mostly handle it . </p>
