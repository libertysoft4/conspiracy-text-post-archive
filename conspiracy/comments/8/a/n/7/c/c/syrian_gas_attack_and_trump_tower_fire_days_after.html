<p>Wow it&#39;s hard to be much more out in the open than that. I&#39;m not a trump fan by any means, but anyone else here think these could be related?</p>

<p>The CNN report reeks of fakery as well. Random footage, &quot;white helmets&quot;, corespondent in &quot;Damascus&quot; (lol ya right, he&#39;s in front of a green screen, he could be anywhere), the way the reporter at the beginning is overselling it, the state dept quote about Syrian gov gassing it&#39;s own citizens, the mandatory mention of Russia at the end. This is just a video production.</p>

<p>C&#39;mon now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hope people see how absurd of an action this would be for Assad or the Russians to do. In CNN&#39;s propaganda piece about Trump pulling out of Russia they argued that Trump announcing he wanted to pull out soon will allow them to just wait until we leave. It&#39;s a pretty big leap from there to blaming Assad. I&#39;m interested to see how this plays out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of get off it. The left complains about fox news all day everyday. The only fucking Republican TV station on television. They&#39;re the problem, says the left. Nevermind the other 75 channels brainwashing you to HATE. Hate fox. Hate their viewers. Hate ANYONE that identifies as a Republican. Hate anyone that doesn&#39;t note down and worship lefty television. Ffs the right gets ONE CHANNEL and dems screen that one channel is the root of all evil. </p>

<p>Fox is the USA’s largest TV station and they, along with a huge chunk of their audience, have the audacity to bitch and moan about mainstream media, despite The Right has been exposed manipulating Local news as well. Then you have the flood of a thousand serious Right-Wing political pundits and their sheep astroturfing social media. Keep crying about how oppressed you are so you can victimize your victimhood while Conservatives make thousands of videos whining about Leftist. </p>

<p>I live in Georgia, most of my friends and family are Republican. I was a Republican myself for 10 years before the party got radicalized and started worshipping idiots like Sarah Palin, becoming increasingly toxic, and serving the interest to the Elite. </p>

<p>100 channels on cable, 99 of them are FAR LEFT. 99 channels spew the same narrative day in and day out. But fox is the problem for giving you a different perspective from the way you&#39;re trained to think. The game is tilted and you&#39;re being brainwashed</p>

<p>Assad: &quot;The US president says he wants US troops to leave my country. I better gas my people in order to stop the US from leaving. Great idea!&quot; 🤨</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, usually when a govt gassed people, it is with logic and reasoning that they have determined that doing so would benefit them in some way. But in this case, there is no benefit to who they are accusing. Assad, who has a long history of mental stability, predictable and had a strong history of upholding religious freedom in his country, really does not seem to be the likely culprit with these gas attacks. Assad just is not a wildcard type person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try telling that to R/Politics. They are in their calling it another Holocaust and calling for war with Russia and assad. They cant even fathom the idea that rebels would kidnap or corral civilians in a tunnel and gas them so they can create more sympathy from Western powers and get them to attack assad and help their islamist regime change.  The fact is that Assad is winning his war against the rebels. Trump is backing out of Syria and there is no logical reason for the Syrian military or supporters to do this. When the rebels who have been proven to fabricate atrocities time and time again have every reason to do this to get western intervention and support in their Islamic revolution. </p>

<p>In 2018 Syria makes headway in removing rebel troops, cue chemical attack.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Timeline-of-Syrian-Chemical-Weapons-Activity">What&#39;s that, you say? They&#39;ve been on this train since 2012?</a> How dumb do you think people are. Clearly they failed at destabilizing the country with rebels and they&#39;ve moved on to the Saddam Hussein WMD strategy.</p>

<p>Reading the r/worldnews thread, it&#39;s very interesting that there&#39;s a strong &quot;Russian Bots&quot; theme running through it. Question the official narrative, be called a Russian bot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Assad would take the risk of this chemical attack, when they are already winning the war. Why would they bomb to involve Americans back to their land, when Trump already said three days ago that he is going to bring the military back? Seems like some vested interest staged this attack, to drag back US to this war and US media is back on their war mongering status. The same pattern we have seen in the past. Last time, Obama missed that opportunity and now this time, I am pretty sure, Trump is going to take it and the missile attacks are soon going to start. It would be interesting to see Iran and Russian response now after all this incident has taken place. The game has just begun!!!!</p>
