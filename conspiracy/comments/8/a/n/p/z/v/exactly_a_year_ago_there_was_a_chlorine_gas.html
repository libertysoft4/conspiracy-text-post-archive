        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now, Trump has stated he wishes to withdraw, and 48 hours later, another gas attack happens. This comes just ONE DAY after Russian news service TASS reported that US &quot;coalition partners&quot; Al Nusra Front and Free Syrian Army, were planning a Chlorine Gas attack upon civilians, so as to blame the Assad government and trigger a massive US attack. Keep in mind that the rebels have been discovered with chemical weapons before, especially after liberating East Ghouta.</p>

<p>Russia has made it crystal clear they will shoot down US Missiles, then sink the US Navy ships that launch them. This Chlorine gas attack is the exact incident necessary to spark an immediate US strike upon Syria, which will trigger an immediate Russia strike upon US forces, which will trigger an immediate war between the US and Russia. Not good!</p>

<p>MOSCOW, April 6. /TASS/. Jabhat al-Nusra (a group outlawed in Russia) and the Free Syrian Army are planning chemical attacks with the use of chlorine in areas under their control, including Daraa’s district of Al-Balad, the chief of Russia’s center for the reconciliation of conflicting parties in Syria, Major-General Yuri Yevtushenko, said on Friday.</p>

<p>So, hopefully the media won&#39;t be able to push the &quot;Assad gassed his own people&quot; narrative very far....but they will try...</p>

<p>But, overall...yes, very little damage..airfield was operational within 24 - 36 hours...what alot of people aren&#39;t aware of...alot of the cruise missiles were either destroyed or missed their target completely...so, that played into it as well.</p>

<p>Some wonder if they were programmed to miss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more concerned with the strawman narrative they build with this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to refute the video proof by pointing to the official reports. This means the user will lose the argument in the public sphere.</p>

<p>It does not mean they don&#39;t have a valid reason for questioning if it was actually Sarin by observing how the attack was responded to...and pointing out the complete lack of proper protective clothing...</p>

<p>But in the end...they will lose the debate.</p>

<p>Personally I believe it&#39;s wiser to bring up the inconsistencies within the reports themselves...as these will be the proofs leaned upon to support the official story.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I took the time to read the full reports...more than once.</p>

<p>Since is /conspiracy... Wikipedia says TASS is owned by the Russian government so how reliable is their reporting? Maybe they make a fake report that the US side is going to do a gas attack, then do a gas attack themselves, then point to the earlier report and say, see they attacked just like we said they were going to.</p>

<p>who benefits from SAA or Russian military using chemical weapons</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the people in the region believe that the chemical attack was carried out by the US, then the attack helps Russia. Russia wants the US out of Syria and wants to assert itself as the new regional hegemon. If people in the region think that the US is behind the attack, they will be more likely to welcome the Russians. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In other words, &quot;who benefits&quot; goes both ways. &quot;Who benefits&quot; is piss poor &quot;analysis.&quot; </p>

<p>In a criminal case, contrary to what we see on TV, &quot;who benefits&quot; doesn&#39;t lead to a conviction. It takes a proven intention and a proven act.</p>

<p>&quot;Who benefits&quot; is nothing but a rule of thumb to line up hypothetical suspects.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/421753-syria-ghouta-chemical-provocation/">March 20: Syria’s Eastern Ghouta militants prepare chemical attack provocation, Russian MoD tipped off </a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Militants holed up in Eastern Ghouta are preparing to stage a “false flag” attack to accuse the Syrian government forces of using chemical weapons against civilians, Russia’s Defense Ministry said, citing a tip from a local.</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, the Russian Reconciliation Center received a phone call from one of the residents of the al-Wanar quarter of Eastern Ghouta, who warned of possible preparations for a “provocation” with the use of chemical agents. According to the tip-off, Tahrir al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra) <strong>terrorists have placed “hermetically sealed containers,” which could contain poisonous substances, next to a self-engineered turbine on one of the roofs in the Damascus suburb.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“The terrorists, according to [the caller], could use those preparations to spray chemical agents in residential areas, which will lead to a large number of casualties among civilians,”</strong> Major-General Yuri Yevtushenko announced on Monday. <strong>“The mass poisoning of civilians will be used to accuse the government troops of the use of chemical weapons against peaceful citizens.”</strong></p>

<p>This is not the first time Moscow has raised concerns about possible provocations using chemical agents in Syria. <strong>Russia believes that such an attack will be widely covered in the Western media and may ultimately be used as a pretext by the US-led coalition to launch strikes against Syrian government forces.</strong></p>

<p>Washington repeatedly warned that it would conduct more air strikes against Syrian forces if chemical weapons are used in the country. <strong>French President Emmanuel Macron also promised to “strike” Syria if any evidence emerges that chemical weapons were used against civilians.</strong></p>
