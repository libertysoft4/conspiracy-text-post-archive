Betsy can gut education while Eric can manipulate the military (I do understand that Eric is no longer heading up Blackwater). Also, the DeVos family created Amway which is a huge multi-level marketing company (pyramid scheme), which can be used to control and push their ideologies as well.</p>

<p>That said these are just a few of the mega rich that are now in power. The swamp is now a lake. We have an ex mercenary trying to setup back channels to the Kremlin. We have two people, Scott Pruitt and Rick Perry, leading the very things they were trying to destroy. </p>

<p>Then there are people here who bitch, rightfully, about Obama&#39;s drone strikes, but don&#39;t realize Trump was just pissed a drone operator waited for a terrorist to leave his family&#39;s house. Instead of just killing everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao, the president of the US doesn&#39;t &quot;just&quot; do anything, he&#39;s the fucking president.  Presidents are not idiots.  Puppets, maybe.  But they are privy to unbelievable depths of information.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t need any help from DA EVIL JOOZE.</p>

<p>Additionally, idk why people are so buggin about the Jews.  Yeah some super rich Jews help run the world cabal.  So do very rich Christians (the Vatican) and Muslims (Mecca).</p>

<p>ALL of the hyper-rich global elites work TOGETHER.  RELIGION IS NOTHING.  It is something that once had truth inside it, truth that has been squirreled away and shown only to those with the mark of esoteric knowledge.  </p>

<p>You think you, some dude on the Internet, understand the intricacies of the rule of the globe?  Get a fucking clue man.  We&#39;re all part of their game.  There is no solution, as the game may only play out one way.  The elites are simply those who have been mandated as the DMs of that game.  If you destroy them or if you assist them, it matters not.  The ending will always be the same.</p>

<p>There are no simple human tongues that describe God&#39;s plan, or even Gaia&#39;s plan.  The Jews, just like any people in power, simply play a role.  There are no Jews, Christians, Muslims, or anything on the other side.  There is only God.</p>

<p>Things are as they shall be.  And how they shall be, by the way, is people like you getting tricked into thinking ANY thing that is nameable is responsible for rights or wrongs.  </p>

<p>Believe me: Trump, Obama, Bush, Putin, Xi Jinping, Andrea Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Theresa May--they are all batting for the same team.  They understand who this team is with varying degrees, depending on what is needed to convince them.  It suffices that they play the roles they have been given.</p>

<p>For a long, long time, since the dawn of self-consciousness, there has been a deliberate strategy to create the next world.  This involves using a reward-pain system of joy and strife to guide the evolution of the next species, <em>Homo omnens</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the vast majority of what you&#39;re saying, but I don&#39;t agree the game can only play out in one way. The future and end of this story is in our hands. Yes we are on a path, but we can alter our course. We are on a script, but by being aware of the script we are changing it all the time. It is in our hands. Don&#39;t spread false pessimism with good information and make people feel hopeless. </p>

<p>Unless I misunderstand you and you are trying to say that the end is always good. But even then, if we simply hope for a good turn of events, a positive, conscious future, we can be robbed of our proactivity. </p>

<p>We need to trust that the future will work out, not only hope, but trust in ourselves, each other and life, trust, then follow that trust with action, proactively making this planet the paradise we all know it has the potential to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I personally wouldn&#39;t say that&#39;s the case. I&#39;d say there definitely is a karmic fate of sorts, but each and every one of us, as awareness has the ability to bypass and change that fate. Fate is a phenomenon that only takes into account events already unfolding in a closed system. Each and every one of us is the portal to the newness, to the infinite freshness, infinite potential. We are doorways to creativity. We are beings that go beyond the closed systen that we have created. That is why I would say that although there is fate, there is destiny, there is a script, but every time you are aware, every time you let go, every time you create, you choose differently,  you change and alter the script. Id even say that inherent chaos and creative wonder is built into this system, as the whole system is closed only from a manifested perspective. The unmanifested consciousness, the pure potential from which all events spring, is always there, everywhere, and always creating freshness and chaos (not necessarily in a negative way, a better word would be unpredictability) on every corner.</p>

<p>Just my perspective though. I meditated on the issues of destiny and free will a lot and these are my personal intuitive insights on the topic.</p>

<p>Best wishes :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha, I just got a hair-trigger for that type of stuff now ever since the deliberate co-opting of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> by the Trump* brigade.</p>

<p>In my mind it is very clear that one of the goals of the &#39;alt-right&#39; Trump stuff has been to totally destroy rational discourse on conspiracy forums.  I know of three big conspiracy forums which used to have a huge amount of free-thinking questioning: Godlike Productions, Above Top Secret, and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  Now what I see in all of them is about 75% &#39;Trump Train&#39; bullshit, 20% anti-Trump bullshit, and 5% real shit, which is usually made to disappear by bots or shills.   I say one of the goals because the global elites are very good at killing hundreds of birds with one stone (e.g. 9/11) </p>

<p>I was going to say &quot;I don&#39;t know when people will wake up and realize that both sides are part of a ploy to keep people concerned with hating each other instead of trying to wrest back our souls from the elites&quot; but the sad thing is that I believe even most of the HyperTrump Cocksucking Club and Demmy-wemmy Super Libtard Squad used to know this.  They have had their weaknesses and insecurities exploited; now the former group thinks that bitching about Jews on 4chan and believing ANYthing labeled a conspiracy theory, even those clearly seeded as disinformation, will change the system, and the latter group thinks that going to a <del>party</del> protest for one single fucking day and holding up signs made with petroleum-based Crayola crayons (owned by super cultural brainwasher Hallmark) bought from Michael&#39;s (owned by Bain Capital, Blackstone Group, etc) and whining out loud will change the system. </p>

<p>*Not that I even really dislike Trump.  I love that he has made it impossible to ignore the farcical nature of the US political system, and I have to admit he makes me giggle.  I don&#39;t even think he is really right-wing.  He is more like a pair of dice, which is hilarious to watch.  Saturday Night Live shouldn&#39;t even try to make fun of him because he is a bundle of real life bizzaro humor that is in a basically untouchable realm.  I am not kidding, I think this shit is the best reality show I&#39;ve ever seen.  What scares me a little bit is that he seems like the kind of guy who would not want to stop being president, and he has laid the psychocultural groundwork for a fascist state--destroying trust in the press (and not just in bullshit TV news etc, but all independent press besides those who like him and probably get kickbacks somehow, maybe in the form of policy changes,) talking about how we should try having a president-for-life like China just set in motion, creating a strong &quot;us vs. them&quot; mentality, wanting to build a giant wall around the country to keep people in, etc.  My schizo hunches tell me that he is already collaborating with various people in the government to stage a coup, likely by using the looming war with Russia to suspend the 2020 election or nullify its results.  2020 is an apocalyptic sounding year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s go back. :)</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t you start out complaining about &quot;ideology&quot;? Your book religion is the ideology. You&#39;re the ideologue. As an ideologue, you must project out your ideology to anyone who disagrees, calling them what you <em>believe</em> is essentially the opposite ideology: &quot;athiesm.&quot;</p>

<p>I am no athiest. </p>

<p>Be careful what you ask for. If you let religion into school, I will require that your religion is viewed in a context that shows the evidence versus the lack of evidence. When a complete picture is shown, people will be rushing to escape your religion.</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s make a deal. You keep religion out of school, and school won&#39;t look at the actual evidence of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My father-in-law was an Amway distributor (very part time).  he never had a problem with their business model.  I’ve read a many critical articles about Amway and also watched a documentary on the company from back in the early ‘1990’s.   Based on this, I would say that the business model has changed favorably to the smaller distributor since then and Amway’s Multi-tiered distributor model is no different from  many other commission based sales models.</p>

<p>In addition, from my own experience I would rate the products that I’ve used from Amway as being very high quality.   To say that Amway is a scam is inaccurate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America has been white male dominated because Europe, at the time of our founding, was white male dominated. It&#39;s not like it was some evil plan, it&#39;s just how things shook out racially across the world. </p>

<p>And as for the left pushing their religion (leftism has become religion), just look no further than college campus. They frequently shut down anyone who dares to speak out against them. Much like radical Christians do. </p>

<p>Or look at Twitter where there is an insatiable mob of leftists attacking anyone who dares to go against the narrative. Look at how they attack their livelihoods, going after sponsors and employers. Or how the left labels anyone who thinks different Nazis, just as the Christians used to label people a demon. </p>

<p>Or we can talk about white privilege and how it&#39;s no different than original sin. But at least with original sin I can attone. There is no attonment in leftist ideology. Or we can talk about how the left frequently disowns anyone who goes against the grain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the reasons for America being dominated by white males. It is the repression of others and the conspiracy to maintain power that I do not agree with. </p>

<p>As far as college campuses go, I went to college in the southeast and I did not see what you are describing. Perhaps it is different now but I doubt that across the entire US every college campus is a leftist thought control project, regardless of what right wing media would report. In college a lot of different demographics and cultures get to meet, I can understand a need to emphasize acceptance but, again, I am sure there are extremes. I have moved to a pretty liberal area and the local university would probably be considered extreme but so what? Go to a different college or don&#39;t worry so much about it. You obviously have not been brainwashed and have been exposed to the &quot;leftist religion&quot; so what makes you so different than those college kids? Oh, they are all soft brained and easily manipulated but you aren&#39;t. I see.</p>

<p>As far as Twitter and the people you named, I have no idea. I am not a person who seeks out and only listens to people that agree with me or who agrees with all I listen to and I very much doubt that there are very many like that. </p>

<p>I think acceptance over control is important and I really don&#39;t care if you want to fuck men, women, or a combination of both. I don&#39;t want average citizens who pay taxes like myself to get fucked continually by either the government or private entities with shitty oversight. Most &quot;lefties&quot; are not bad people. We have to quit looking at the country as us and them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want a Christian national state the equivalent of an Islamic national state and that was what this post is about. I seem to have triggered some right wingers though.</p>

<p>It is absolutely different now, and it&#39;s different on the coasts. Just look at Ben Shapiro, Milo, Jordan Peterson, Thomas Sowell, Dave Rubin, Christina Hoff Sommers, Steven Crowder, etc. It&#39;s an increasingly big problem. The leftists on campuses are no platforming any conservative voice that disagrees with them, all under the guise of &quot;safety&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot;. Once again, just as the religious right used to ban athesim, the &quot;religious&quot; left is banning conservatism. </p>

<p>I never used to term brainwashed. I think it&#39;s easy for young and malleable minds to get sucked into the idea of diversity and equality. It&#39;s easy to not look at it any deeper than that. It makes you feel good and morally right. It&#39;s easy to react emotionally to people who disagree with you, especially when the adults (faculty) are cheering you on and reacting in the same way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most &quot;lefties&quot; are not bad people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Now, that quote is a bit hyperbolic in this instance. I accept that. However, most &#39;leftists&#39; don&#39;t bother to look any deeper than the surface. They don&#39;t even <em>see</em> what&#39;s going on around them. They don&#39;t see that they are being used by people for nefarious ends. </p>

<p>I have no doubt most leftists are good people. I know a bunch, and they&#39;re brilliant people. What they are all, though, is uninformed about the radicals in their party and when brought to their attention, they typically deny they exist or downplay their significance. It&#39;s a soft support for their means and methods, and that&#39;s dangerous. They&#39;re just fighting for inclusiveness, after all. </p>

<p>Once again, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t want a Christian national state the equivalent of an Islamic national state and that was what this post is about. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t either. But I also don&#39;t want a state that says it&#39;s okay to hate people based on their race or gender, or that people who weren&#39;t alive during slavery somehow have a duty to &quot;make up for it&quot; to people who weren&#39;t slaves. I don&#39;t want a state that says men who weren&#39;t alive in the 1800s somehow have to pay (not with physical money) for the sins of their fathers. I also don&#39;t want a state that says it&#39;s illegal to state basic biology (There are only two genders). I don&#39;t want a college that bans and no platforms people who do the same. I also don&#39;t want a state that compels speech (see Canada and their pronoun law). </p>

<p>But we&#39;ve digressed. You asked, essentially, how the left was just like a religion. I&#39;ve answered how. If you are against religious national states, you should be against the current wave of progressives gaining state power. They&#39;re literally the puritan right, fighting the same fights but for different reasons. </p>

<p>The puritan right says sex is wrong and thus must be censored. The progressive left says objectifying women is wrong and thus sex must be censored. The puritan right says video games cause violence and thus must be censored. The progressive left says video games cause men to beat women and thus must be censored. I could go on, but you get the point (I hope). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, if you wanted to talk about the extreme left I could maybe understand some of the examples that you are giving. But once again you are making the assumption that other people cannot maintain a balanced opinion and will be lead to destruction. It is the same fallacy you made when talking about college students. A person can be liberal and not want television censored or video games censored. That person is not just a puppet of the ultra liberals or so inept that they will blindly follow the next extreme measure. </p>

<p>What are the &quot;nefarious ends&quot; that these extreme liberals want, do you think? I am genuinely unaware of the dangers.</p>

<p>And when you say &quot;ban,&quot; do you mean illegal or publicly frowned upon in public spaces including publicly funded universities? Because there are plenty of private colleges all over the nation that set their own standards. Not just colleges either. But if a university is receiving public tax dollars they have to accept everyone and try to create a space where that person feels comfortable or law suits ensue which cost more taxpayer dollars. Perhaps some conservatives should consider suing? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, a person can be liberal and actually be liberal. That&#39;s why I never call them liberals. I call then leftists. </p>

<p>And what you think is the &quot;extreme&quot; left is becoming more and more mainstream. The Democratic presidential candidate said that it was women who were the real victims of war, not the dead men. Think about that. </p>

<p>These progressive ideas turn into rage. Telling people they are oppressed, that so and so race or gender hates them, that &quot;the man&quot; hates them.. these aren&#39;t good idrals to be pushing. They justify terrible actions. </p>

<p>The nefarious ends are they create a segmented population that they can then rile up against each other, among other things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, justify the claim that it&#39;s the right pushing oppressive agendas. Can you name me on law designed to oppress minorities that was put forth by Republicans?</p>

<p>I can name one from the democrats - gun control. Little known fact, MLK was denied a carry permit due to democrats gun control laws. Also, gun control laws don&#39;t get enforced in affluent white neighborhoods, they Target the inner city which is largely minorities. </p>

<p>Second off, racism will always exist. We&#39;ll never rid the world of it. That doesn&#39;t make it okay to call everyone you disagree with racist. That doesn&#39;t make it okay to no platform them at a public university. That doesn&#39;t make it okay to incorrectly label half of Americans as racist. </p>

<p>Racism is evil, I agree. I just also believe it&#39;s evil to use the charge of racism as a bludgeon to stifle discussion and debate. </p>

<p>Anti-abortion laws are not racist, at all. They&#39;re not even sexist. I&#39;m pro-choice but I fully understand people who aren&#39;t. Maybe you try a little understanding instead of demonization. Also, planned Parenthood was started as a way of controlling the black population. </p>

<p>Anti-gay laws aren&#39;t racist, either. And they don&#39;t exist anymore. Hell, a private Christian bakery can&#39;t even opt out of baking a cake for a gay wedding. </p>

<p>Voter registration being anything is just laughable. The idea that minorities can&#39;t get the IDs to vote is what&#39;s racist. Maybe stop believing black people are too dumb to find the DMV ;)</p>

<p>I asked for current laws and proposals, by the way. I could go through history and find many laws, passed by many politicians, that suppress many people.

<p>That is what you said. I see nothing about &quot;current&quot; though we are not going back that far. Stop changing the goal posts.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just about black people as you have stated so many times (bias leak?) but it is about poor people who tend to be minorities. Voting is a right whether you like it or not and every citizen has that right with or without an id. To force people to go to a DMV which could be miles away and give up a day of work to stand in lines which would be incredibly long because all of a sudden everyone needs an id is way more restricting to those of low income than to those who are well off. I am not below the poverty line but to take a day off work and go stand in line at a DMV which is thirty miles away would not be easy for me either and I have a car which some of these people do not. Not everyone lives in the city and our public transportation in this country is atrocious or nonexistent. It just so happens that these people who would have a harder time getting an id tend to vote Democrat as well. Now tell me that is not purposefully restrictive? And the &quot;need&quot; for these voter id laws are all based on the false claim that &quot;illegals&quot; are voting in our elections. No proof has been shown of that. The only person I recall participating in voter fraud last election was a Trump supporter who tried to vote more than once. So...yeah. And again, those were Southern Democrats that were against freeing slaves which are the equivalent of (and they became) Republicans later on. We went over this with your MLK statement. Do some research.</p>

<p>And what is that little Fox News thing at the bottom of your post?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said it was Republicans PUSHING oppressive laws, implying current. Don&#39;t put your poor choice of words (if they were even that) on me. </p>

<p>Think about what you said, minorities are poor. How is that NOT a racist statement? Why assume all poor people are minorities? And I said black people because that&#39;s what the video referenced. If you read my other comments, I clearly said minorities. But nice shift there ;)</p>

<p>Voting in our elections is a right for CITIZENS. If you cannot verify your citizenship you have no legal right to vote. And you shouldn&#39;t have that right. Our government is not open to input of non citizens. Canada, Norway, France, and Brazil (among many other nations) require proof of citizenship to vote. Are these nations racist?</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://cces.gov.harvard.edu">this study</a> shows that anywhere between 8 and 15% of illegal immigrants voted in the 2008 election. When you say &quot;non credible evidence&quot; you&#39;re either lying or you&#39;ve never actually looked into it. </p>

<p>Regardless of of they vote or not, though, non citizens have no right to vote. It is not illegal, racist, or wrong for a nation to verify only citizens vote. </p>

<p>And you know exactly what that Fox snark was about. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to note that I&#39;ve contuously provided sources for my claims. You&#39;ve only asserted things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Voter ID wikipedia article says absolutely nothing about them being racist. You need to prove that claim. The Alabama Abortion Law may or may not be racist. One article isn&#39;t enough for me and I don&#39;t have to time to really dig into it. But we should recognize that state laws are not the same as federal laws. Racism is never right, but it means far more if done at the federal level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Roy Moore is an example of a republican who, while seated as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, installed a monument of the Ten Commandments in front of a judicial building using tax payer dollars and then after being removed from office he returned to the bench and ordered judges to ignore the federal courts overturning of same sex marriage ban. I wasn’t even talking about his sexual misconduct which is why I assume you brought up Anthony Weiner.</p>

<p>And I doubt you and I will be able to determine whether people have used abortion laws to suppress though I believe they have and there are plenty of articles to support it, whether you agree or not. </p>

<p>The Wikipedia article certainly does touch on reasons for voter id laws being overturned and cites discriminatory practices as the reason for the overturns. The first few introductory paragraphs also go into detail on the debate about the practice and states that the type of voter fraud that the laws are out to prevent is extremely rare.</p>

<p>These are just on cursory searches and without even digging very deep.</p>

<p>And I agree about State’s rights but you also have to acknowledge that often times if it is done at a state level those same people would like for it to be done federally (same sex marriage as an example).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t a fucking plan, though. The reason it shook out that was was largely out of need. Women did not make as good of hunters as men. Women weren&#39;t as strong and thus made bad warriors. Men were unable to breastfeed so they were terrible at raising a baby. </p>

<p>What you call an evil plan is just too genders finding a way to survive and ensure their existence as a race. You&#39;re trying to sell this idea that men wanted nothing more than to keep women down. That men and women were constantly at war with each other. This is not correct and it&#39;s a trope that has done far more harm than good. </p>

<p>As for the racial thing, I was pretty clear - wen imported black slaves. It&#39;s undeniable. Some of that was done with evil intent, some of it was tradition. None of it was right. But that doesn&#39;t explain how people of different skin colors were born in different areas of the globe. Africa has largely benefited from black males, is that just as bad? How about China largely benefitting from Asian men?</p>

<p>Also, this idea that we&#39;ve only benefitted from men is the nice progressive way of downplaying women. As if women played no role in bringing us to where we are because the evil men held them down. Life tip - without a mother to birth you and give you a boob to suck on, you wouldn&#39;t be here. </p>

<p>One last thing, as we&#39;ve progressed beyond our old constraints (fomula, machinery to make manual labor easier, etc) we&#39;ve also progressed towards parity of the genders. </p>

<p>By the way, my patriarchy called. It wants the draft laws to go away and only be applied to women now. Oh, it would also like the family courts to start granting the majority custody to men, make women pay child support, and force divorced wives to give their ex husbands thousands of dollars a month in alimony. It would also like women to take the CEO jobs and have them work 100 hours a week, constantly travel, and never be home for their husbands or kids. It&#39;s also sick of making men work dangerous jobs, so could we get women to do those jobs too? </p>

<p>But not all men hold power, and women are not excluded from holding power, at least not in America. Do patriarchies exist across the world? Absolutely, especially in the middle east. But that is not America, and it hasn&#39;t been America for a long time. </p>

<p>The proof of this is, as they say, in the pudding. Who makes the decisions in your house hold? In a patriarchal society, the man&#39;s word is the last word. That&#39;s not my house, at all. My wife is absolutely the boss. Same with the house I grew up in -- my mother made all the major decisions. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree that the powerful &#39;conspire&#39; (though I don&#39;t like that word here for various reasons) to keep the plebs down. I disagree with the notion that it&#39;s done with the intent of keeping specifically <em>women</em> down. </p>

As far as the examples that I gave they were all pretty hard fought and mostly opposed by conservative groups which identify as &quot;the right&quot;. Take that to mean what you will. BTW you are doing kind a bad job at baiting and not really adding anything of substance. You could try to answer some of the questions people have asked you as there seem to be some folk who are interested in having a conversation while you are just trying to incite anger. But it might require you to actually sit and think out a logical answer instead of these knee jerk responses you have been spitting out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While sharia is not prevalent now the only goal of Islam, ultimately, is to have all states under religious law; it states as much in the Quran. Human history shows us that some form of religion will be the foundation of our laws and customs.

So again, a violent religion hell-bent on world domination, resulting in sharia law is what you are supporting. For me?

<p>I have two questions:</p>

<p>1) If Christianity is so much worse then you support Mohammed marrying Aisha at the age of 6 and having sex with her at 9 years old?</p>

<p>2) Do you condemn Humas for his genocidal actions in the name of Islam? </p>

<p>For other people on this thread learn more about Islam: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then Eric created an army that was paid for by the entire country to replace soldiers in Iraq and A-stan while the political process pretended to make good on their word of getting out of the middle east.  Instead, they fueled the creation of the contractor world and an army unaccountable to the rule of law.  Sidestepping all or most legal requirements and standards that we place on our soldiers abroad.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyoqd0QDtSg">Remember this one?  Probably one of many, but justice was served only because this one got out in the open.</a></p>

<p>So a christian army of sorts that is largely outside the legal structure, the cost was much higher in dollars as contractors would routinely make 3 times as much as a regular soldier and the money would still come from your tax dollars.</p>

<p>A corporate army swapped out with the US army was still paid for by the people who were thinking it was all coming to an end when it wasn&#39;t.  It was the baby steps to something worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is misconception about these people and their religious affiliation. Christ like in mind, soul and actions comes with a perception of compassion, care and love. To say some of these people are nothing but criminals is the misconception. True to faith Christian, Jews or Muslim often(or as best they can) try to obey the doctrines of their faith. They are usually service to others, caring, compassionate and devoted to the upliftment of their fellow humans. The behavior these criminals exhibit are far from Christ like, they serve their own selfish nature. They put money and profits before everything and everyone all while pushing their own agenda. Call them what you want but the last thing they should be called is the fake psuedo religious mask they hide behind. The beginning of wisdom is calling something by its proper name.</p>

<p>Really? Cause last I checked &quot;news comedians&quot; like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and Jon Oliver have all donated millions to charity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While people like yourself post about how virtuous you are hoping others will like your post or give you a gold star</p>

<p>Cause I said or implied fucking any of that with my comment bud. I was totally trying to earn karma and have people praise my altruism with my quick comment on r/conspiracy on Reddit. That&#39;s sarcasm by the way chief. </p>

<p>Conservative fundamentalist Christians have done <em>way</em> more harm to this country than good. They are the reason we have backward ass local laws telling gay people they&#39;re subhuman scum, they are the reason the Westboro Baptist Church exists, and they have <em>ZERO</em> place in influencing national politics on a federal level. And you, frankly, are opposed to the entire concept of this nation if you think we should co-opt Christian beliefs into our laws. This country literally exists because people didn&#39;t want the government to tell them what religion to practice or beliefs to hold. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone who has large disposable income gives a tiny portion to a charity as a tax right off is much more noble than Deacon Dan who makes 30K a year and gives a thousand dollars a year and 16 hours a week actually helping people in need is horrible.  Good call there chief.</p>

<p>You are virtue signalling now, tell me how much of your income do you give to the homeless shelter?  Are they worth sacrificing your internet?  How about that double latte, or your smart phone?  People like you are the biggest phonies because you screech about all these things, belittle those who actually do help, then demand the government do it in your stead so you can gloat about what a wonderful person you are reddit/facebag/twatter.</p>

<p>I never understand the stupidity of people like you,  do you understand the concept of how the right and left work?  The right is not proactive it&#39;s reactionary.  If you want to know why the right does something see what the left has done.  For example, if you want gays to be more accepted stop doing things like flogging each other with dildos at pride parades.  You have no right to tell people to stay out of privacy of your your bedroom when you drag your bedroom out into public.  </p>

<p>Westboro Baptist Baptist Church is a scam meant to make money through lawsuits against local municipalities.  For years they go out say outrageous things and either sue for not letting them speak, or for not protecting them if they get so much as touched.  They are a boogeyman.</p>

<p>Quantify your assertion about Christians doing more harm.  They basically  started the most successful revolution in human history and built the most powerful nation in history in less than 250 years.  Please don&#39;t start the founding fathers were not christian nonsense your kind preaches as fact.  Their are 300 plus founding fathers and you can maybe surmise 2 were lapsed Christians and one was a nihilist who went crazy with drink.  Actually read thier thoughts instead of depending on some website to tell you what to think.  I can tell you that all of them thought that Christianity was essential to the stability of the republic.  Only moral people can be trusted with freedom. </p>

<p>It used to be that people could disagree politically and still be amiable, people like yourself killed that and are hundred times worse than any bible thumping fundie ranting about hell.  I would hope you get over your edgy daddy issues and get out of your echo chamber, it&#39;s what is poisoning this country.  I will pray for you, mostly because it will annoy you though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With Backwater&#39;s background and Erik Prince, I am sure that he has ill intent. With Betsy DeVos&#39; statements about education and religion, I am sure that her intent is to promote her religious views in America by legislation and that is ill intent in my book. I am not antiChristian but I am against religion in government or religion dictating government. Just because someone wants a god to control their life does not mean I do.</p>

<p>Yes, the Roman Empire may have used Christianity, but only after murdering a few hundred thousand.  If you knew your history, you&#39;d know that the crusades were a <a href="https://home.isi.org/four-myths-about-crusades">response to Muslim aggression</a>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ignorance is breathtaking brother. The sanctity of human life is a cornerstone in Christianity. They ended the social accepted practices of pedophilia and homosexuality in the ancient world, help stop human sacrifice as the normal way of thanking the gods(your username). Stopped the gladiatorial matches. and Jesus teaching about &quot;turning the other cheek&quot; is not found in any philosophy or religion previous. The claim bout the crusades is just stupid, since true Christians have since the founding of the catholic church understood that the pope/vatican is :&quot;Mystery, Babylon the Great, Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth.&quot; and if you still want to play the muh muh &quot;crusades&quot; card , check this out : Encyclopedia of War , by Charles Philips &amp; Allan axelrod. It puts this into perspective for you. of all wars in human history, only 6.9% has been religious in origin. If you take Islam out only 3.2%. In the U.S TV evangelism is a coin-tel-pro propaganda arm of you government . You calling these false teachers, christian, is to me, as if I called snoop dog &quot;straight-edge&quot;. Jesus puts down in very clear terms who he would call a follower of Christ. Luke 6:46 “And why call ye Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not the things which I say?&quot;. Christianity as taught by Jesus, allows no murder, no lying, no hypocrisy, no sexual immorality. Is these satanist claiming to be Christian like Prince &amp; DeVos following Christ? &quot;Matthew 19:24 And again I say unto you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.”
In the information age ignorance is a choice. You guys better read up on some of the stuff you comment on. But I guess is not the reddit way to do things. The most important thing for anti-christians is to read the bible. Otherwise you&#39;ll just keep making fools of yourselves.  Proverbs 15:28 The heart of the righteous studieth how to answer, but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.</p>

<p>I call people &quot;shills&quot; because they exist, and are paid to astroturf subreddits, online forums and social media. I called you specifically a shill because the idea that anyone could legitimately think that there is some &quot;christian propaganda&quot; today is absolutely insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the Christians that want to smash gay people&#39;s heads in with rocks?</p>

<p>I love how the old testament book they quote, Leviticus, has a passage right before the whole &quot;smash gays heads with rocks&quot; about prohibiting  blood sacrifice to the God, Molek.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Lord said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites: ‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Molek is to be put to death. The members of the community are to stone him. I myself will set my face against him and will cut him off from his people; for by sacrificing his children to Molek, he has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name. If the members of the community close their eyes when that man sacrifices one of his children to Molek and if they fail to put him to death, I myself will set my face against him and his family and will cut them off from their people together with all who follow him in prostituting themselves to Molek.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I fail to see anything positive from this Bronze Age nonsense...the Old Testament at least. The whole &quot;love everyone without exception&quot; thing is pretty positive :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re trying to argue that the Old Testament is only for Jews and not Christians. I am saying you’re wrong about that. Im saying that many(safe to say most) Christians read or at least believe in the Bible, which includes the Old Testament, whether you like it or not. Maybe in your super woke opinion they are not true Christians or whatever, but that’s your opinion and I’d wager that they’d disagree with you about not being true Christians.

Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.

They scrubbed &#39;God&#39; from everything in public schools which means the lower-class and most of the middle-class now no longer has a choice but to send their kids to atheist school even if that&#39;s not what they wish.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s Christian Reformed but with an incredibly staunch pro-Dutch leaning. For example, if you do not have the right last name (something that sounds straight from The Netherlands), don&#39;t expect to receive acceptance into church organizations. In general, members of the church are fairly educated and will put on a liberal, tolerant face. But they are actually judgier and more conservative than Christian Reformed people. </p>

<p>Most Dutch Christian Reformed families educate their kids in separate schools. Grand Rapids schools on general already feel like Christian schools (probably Betsys ideal public school system). My Bio teacher (Dutch btw) told us all the time he didn&#39;t believe in evolution and that he was essentially a  Young Earth Creationist. Colleges and Universities in the area (that are largely funded by the DeVos family) Hope College, among others, perpetuate this exclusivity. I grew up hearing &quot;if you aren&#39;t Dutch, you aren&#39;t much,&quot; because I looked Dutch so they thought I was in on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could have just gotten my High School Diploma yesterday and still be smart enough to know that Christian organizations are guilty of committing every act on your short list in one way or another. Do I need a source to say that the Catholic church has a bit of a history when it comes to sexualizing children? Huh? Are you going to sit here in r/conspiracy and deadass tell me, with your sparkly masters in history, that that isn&#39;t a thing that has happened and is currently happening within the walls of the Catholic organization? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe many of the conspiracy theories here but I used to come for good, honest debate. I used to learn things that made me reconsider my beliefs. I used to teach skeptics things that they should consider when trying to find the truth of different events.</p>

<p>Then this sub turned into a pizzagate-loving, pro-Trump fuckfest.</p>

<p>This is very cool. I&#39;m excited.</p>

Dumb the next generation down, shut up those that aren&#39;t like-minded, brand dissenters as enemies of the state.

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s go back. :)</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t you start out complaining about &quot;ideology&quot;? Your book religion is the ideology. You&#39;re the ideologue. As an ideologue, you must project out your ideology to anyone who disagrees, calling them what you <em>believe</em> is essentially the opposite ideology: &quot;athiesm.&quot;</p>

<p>I am no athiest. </p>

<p>Be careful what you ask for. If you let religion into school, I will require that your religion is viewed in a context that shows the evidence versus the lack of evidence. When a complete picture is shown, people will be rushing to escape your religion.</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s make a deal. You keep religion out of school, and school won&#39;t look at the actual evidence of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>America has been white male dominated because Europe, at the time of our founding, was white male dominated. It&#39;s not like it was some evil plan, it&#39;s just how things shook out racially across the world. </p>

<p>And note that I&#39;m not talking about slavery. We absolutely imported black slaves. But we were white male dominated long before that. </p>

<p>And as for the left pushing their religion (leftism has become religion), just look no further than college campus. They frequently shut down anyone who dares to speak out against them. Much like radical Christians do. </p>

<p>Or look at Twitter where there is an insatiable mob of leftists attacking anyone who dares to go against the narrative. Look at how they attack their livelihoods, going after sponsors and employers. Or how the left labels anyone who thinks different Nazis, just as the Christians used to label people a demon. </p>

<p>Or we can talk about white privilege and how it&#39;s no different than original sin. But at least with original sin I can attone. There is no attonment in leftist ideology. Or we can talk about how the left frequently disowns anyone who goes against the grain. </p>

<p>First off, justify the claim that it&#39;s the right pushing oppressive agendas. Can you name me on law designed to oppress minorities that was put forth by Republicans?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is what you said. I see nothing about &quot;current&quot; though we are not going back that far. Stop changing the goal posts.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just about black people as you have stated so many times (bias leak?) but it is about poor people who tend to be minorities. Voting is a right whether you like it or not and every citizen has that right with or without an id. To force people to go to a DMV which could be miles away and give up a day of work to stand in lines which would be incredibly long because all of a sudden everyone needs an id is way more restricting to those of low income than to those who are well off. I am not below the poverty line but to take a day off work and go stand in line at a DMV which is thirty miles away would not be easy for me either and I have a car which some of these people do not. Not everyone lives in the city and our public transportation in this country is atrocious or nonexistent. It just so happens that these people who would have a harder time getting an id tend to vote Democrat as well. Now tell me that is not purposefully restrictive? And the &quot;need&quot; for these voter id laws are all based on the false claim that &quot;illegals&quot; are voting in our elections. No proof has been shown of that. The only person I recall participating in voter fraud last election was a Trump supporter who tried to vote more than once. So...yeah. And again, those were Southern Democrats that were against freeing slaves which are the equivalent of (and they became) Republicans later on. We went over this with your MLK statement. Do some research.</p>

<p>And what is that little Fox News thing at the bottom of your post?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say &quot;continuously&quot; is a fucking reach considering you have linked to two things: one video with the title &quot;How white liberals really view black voters&quot; so we can be sure that is unbiased and the study you linked to is just a CCES Dataverse website which holds lots of information though I am unsure if what you are talking about is there.</p>

<p>I honestly do not understand the Fox News reference and didn&#39;t even realize it was snark, so...fail I guess? I&#39;d still like to know though so if you want to explain I&#39;d be ok with that.</p>

<p>I stated that voting was a citizen&#39;s right. I didn&#39;t imply otherwise.</p>

<p>You want sources? Ok, thought this stuff was common knowledge. Sorry about that. </p>

<p>I went with Wikipedia for most things because it is just so blatant.</p>
