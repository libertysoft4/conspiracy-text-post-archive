        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Eminem sold his soul when he first released The Slim Shady LP under Dr. Dre&#39;s wing. It wasn&#39;t until his third album (The Eminem Show) that we began hearing him talk about it. In a track titled Say Goodbye Hollywood, he talks about leaving the rap game and ending his deal with the devil in order to raise his daughters properly. This plays a very important role in the theory, but before we discuss it further let me showcase some of the lines from this song. He raps &quot;If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol, I would, to end it for good and say goodbye to Hollywood&quot; then followed by the lines &quot;But now I&#39;m a responsible father so not a lot of good I&#39;d be to my daughter laying in the bottom of the mud&quot;.  These lines here show that if it wasn&#39;t for the existence of his daughter he would&#39;ve definitely taken his own life by now to get out of the deal. Later on in the song he says &quot;I don&#39;t wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it...this is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick&quot;, he doesn&#39;t want to quit rapping but selling his soul ruined the experience for him. &quot;I never dreamt I&#39;d get to the level that I&#39;m at, this is whack/This is more than I ever could&#39;ve asked.../I sold my soul to the devil, I&#39;ll never get it back/I just wanna leave this game with level head intact&quot;. Even though he knows that he has already sold his soul and will forever be a household name, he seems confident that he can get out of the deal. </p>

<p>He released another album, Encore, in 2004, before taking a huge hiatus until 2009. During this time period it is a known fact that he had overdosed and nearly died, which was his reason for taking such a long break. However, what if that never happened and it was just an excuse for his absence? What I believe really happened is that the higher ups in the industry, or whoever he sold his soul to, allowed him to take all those years off to live a normal life with his daughters, in return that after they have grown up he will have to become a puppet of the industry for the remainder of his life. </p>

<p>My main reason for believing this is the song My Darling, released in 2009 on his comeback album after his hiatus. The song depicts a demon coming back to haunt Eminem and basically telling him that break time is over. Em tells the demon &quot;I had you beat!&quot; (he broke out of the deal with the devil) to which the demon responds &quot;No, I was playing possom/Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom/I gave you enough time, your soul&#39;s mine/I&#39;m taking it back...&quot; Throughout the song the demon tries to persuade Em to bleach his hair again and get back on stage. After Em rebels against this, the demon threatens to call Dr. Dre. Em shrugs it off, saying he already talked to Dre about this, but to Em&#39;s surprise Dre shows up and sides with the demon, showing Dre&#39;s complicity in the occult aspect of the industry. At this point, Em tries to shoot himself and end it for good (callback to Say Goodbye Hollywood) but the gunshot to the head does nothing, as the demon explains &quot;You can&#39;t kill a spirit even if you tried to/You sold your soul to me, need I remind you?/You remember that night you prayed to God you&#39;d give anything to get a record deal? Well, Dre signed you/This is what you wanted your whole life, Marshall&quot;. After these lines, we hear Em begin to sing along synonymously with the demon, showing that he has accepted his fate as an industry puppet. </p>

<p>It was after this album that Em became the industry puppet that he is today. This is not a political post, but the Eminem that was around back in his prime would not have made a diss track against Donald Trump. Em used to be completely anti-MSM, that&#39;s what he became famous for. But after returning from his hiatus, he has completely changed. He used to rap about how brainless and redundant pop singers are, now he works with them on almost every song. </p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Selling your soul is a requirement to get big in Hollywood. Combine that with the recent ties to pedophilia and sex slavery in Hollywood and politics, and you realize that there&#39;s no &quot;way out&quot;. Once they own you, they own you. If you try to get out, they let some of your dirt out and ruin your image.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bunch of sick people. Dave Chappelle said it on his 4 hour interview at Behind The Actors Studio (I think it was called that). It&#39;s an interview worth watching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s the people who think Eminem sold his soul are the ones who sold their souls. After 9-11, Eminem bucked an oppressive system to criticize the current government -- the George W. Bush White House and the Republican Congress. He did this despite huge pressures on those who would dare to speak out about George W. Bush best exemplified in the Dixie Chicks &quot;bash&quot; and the immediate, total, and permanent disappearance of Dixie Chicks music from the newly formed radio conglomerates. </p>

<p>Today, as is consistent with his dislike of those Republicans then, Eminem disparages your precious Donald Trump. Since the <em>policies</em> of Donald Trump, George W. Bush, and Republicans generally are pretty much the same -- deregulation of industry, tax cuts for the wealthiest, massive government spying, military build up, etc., and even the percentage of the population supporting Republican Donald Trump being well in line with percentages that supported George W. Bush or Mitt Romney.</p>

<p>TL;DR NO, Eminem did not sell out. If you opposed George W. Bush and now support Donald Trump, you need a mirror. Maybe there, you&#39;ll find the sell out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know is this sub loves the “Luciferian Cultist Elite” theory, and so do I.</p>

<p>There’s certainly a lot of shady stuff that sort of points to that possibility.</p>

<p>But couldn’t “selling your soul” be like a euphemism for selling it to <em>Hollywood</em>(the Devil)?
Like going all in, no looking back, your life as you know it will never be the same, and once you get to a certain point you literally can’t go back to a life before fame. This lifestyle takes you away from human nature, you are not experiencing what everyone else is, your soul is corrupt.</p>

<p>Now, obviously not everybody in Hollywood is a fetus eating rapist, but I think to obtain the level of success (however one defines it) you’d have to sell your soul to something. Material wealth does not make itself.</p>

<p>Not only is the technology not there, but our understanding of how the brain functions is nowhere near where it needs to be.  There are actual neuroscientists who believe consciousness is a product of electrical activity in the brain............thats not how consciousness works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a great question! I don’t know if anyone <em>truly</em> knows. “The spiritual or immaterial part of a human being or animal, regarded as immortal”, would be the definition. But I’ve heard a lot of different additions to that. </p>

<p>But if your soul is immortal, and you make a pact with some outside entity for the benefit of this <em>one</em> body, lifetime, and worldly possessions, you’ve fucked up. Because your soul will continue once the vessel dies, and nobody really knows what’s gonna happen after that lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking that as well but what about all the people in Hollywood that spoke about signing things in blood? About not being able to quit? Also the Freemason blood oaths? It really does all seem really occultic. Also Lady Gaga said some shit where she said a demon was following her and she couldn&#39;t sleep. And who did she have dinner with? Marina Ambramovic. Wtf?

    <div class="md"><p>I really hope I’m not seeming dismissive, I’m not, I’m just trying to look at it from a neutral point of view.
Admittedly I haven’t heard of that, signing in blood.
Maybe another metaphor? I’ve heard it used before when you sign an extremely binding contract.</p>

<p>Who knows what’s involved which that, you are basically ascending to a level of living that is unheard of for most of the world. If there really are puppeteers or dark forces pulling strings, I’m sure access to the ‘club’ is extremely strict. </p>

<p>Definitely a lot of strange pieces to this puzzle for sure.
I mean, I struggle with night terrors and insomnia, I’ve often seen (or though to have) things following me. Most often a shadow like serpent that nests above my bedroom door. But I attribute that to sleep deprivation (I’ve had many hallucinations due to no sleep lol).</p>

<p>Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised either. It would certainly make more sense to think the bad people in the world (some) are corrupted by forces beyond our capability. Rather than just truly evil and vile for no reason. I suppose a strong enough belief is just as effective as the real thing, though.</p>

<p>My favorite topic to discuss! I’ll have to look into the blood oaths!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t seem dismissive and looking at it from a neutral point is a good thing. I always try to do that but with the amount of time I spent looking into this topic I feel like it&#39;s darker than just a euphemism. </p>

<p>On YouTube (maybe not anymore) there was a long documentary with loads of clips from artists claiming they sold their souls/ signed contracts in blood. Lady Gaga, Bob Dylan, Jay-z, Beyoncé, Katy perry and MJ were in it along with a few others. It was pretty creepy.</p>

<p>I agree that if there&#39;s a secret club it would be strict. There&#39;s probably different levels to it like a hierarchy. 
For most it is hard to believe that humans can be so vile and evil for no reason. I feel like there&#39;s always usually a reason though. I feel like it always links back up to this corrupt system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My interpretation of My Darling is that the demon is a personal one. It’s the one associated with fame that brings out the worst in Marshall because he becomes Slim Shady/Eminem</p>

<p>His gimmick was a focal point of his early in his career. Quirky, drugged up white boy that obscenely raps about pop culture and tests censorship.</p>

<p>“Real slim shady” called attention to the gimmick and how labels and artists were trying to recreate the success he had.</p>

<p>Marshall started Shady records and made more than enough money to take the extended break from music.</p>

<p>I think he’s clearly outgrown the gimmick. The song is about his fame monster and those around him wanting him to return to it.</p>

<p>If he truly was being used as an industry puppet I think they would have him return to the gimmick to milk the cash cow until there’s no more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what it is.  People want the old &quot;ill take all the drugs, fuck your wife and tell a story about kidnapping and murder&quot; Eminem back.  Exactly what you said, he has outgrown that.  It&#39;s no different than gangsta rappers that &quot;made it.&quot;  Once they are rich, no longer living in poverty, they cant really rap and tell stories about it any longer. </p>

<p>I mean, imagine Ice Cube making a comeback and writing songs about being a west coast gangster.  Like, dude, youre 50 years old and make kids movies.  It just wouldnt work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Besides the well stated general points about gimmickry and maturity discussion above, this whole idea seems ridiculous:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Eminem that was around back in his prime would not have made a diss track against Donald Trump</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s the people who think Eminem sold his soul are the ones who sold their souls. After 9-11, Eminem bucked an oppressive system to criticize the current government -- the George W. Bush White House and the Republican Congress. He did this despite huge pressures on those who would dare to speak out about George W. Bush best exemplified in the Dixie Chicks &quot;bash&quot; and the immediate, total, and permanent disappearance of Dixie Chicks music from the newly formed radio conglomerates. </p>

<p>Today, as is consistent with his dislike of those Republicans then, Eminem disparages precious Donald Trump. The <em>policies</em> of Donald Trump, George W. Bush, and Republicans generally are pretty much the same -- deregulation of industry, tax cuts for the wealthiest, massive government spying, military build up, etc., and even the percentage of the population supporting Republican Donald Trump being well in line with percentages that supported George W. Bush or Mitt Romney.</p>

<p>TL;DR NO, Eminem did not sell out. If you opposed George W. Bush and now support Donald Trump, you need a mirror. Maybe there, you&#39;ll find the sell out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So are you saying it’s physically impossible to be both anti-msm and Anti-trump at the same time? I don’t understand how you think he would have never made a dis track against trump in his prime when he took numerous shots at W. Bush all throughout his prime? This whole “oh you don’t like trump, you must be sucking the MSM tit” is getting old.... believe it or not people can not like trump because he is just a shitty President, their opinion of msm is an entirely different issue and the two beliefs can coexist just fine..... I don’t like trump and I hate msm, it’s not hard to dislike both....</p>

<p>it’s like saying everyone who didn’t like obama or Clinton must have be brainwashed by the far-right media..... that just doesn’t make sense and takes away the value of someone’s personal opinion by basically treating it like it couldn’t possibly be their own opinion.....

    <div class="md"><p>Again your mixing his views of the media and his views of trump, why does he have to give into anything? Why can’t he be a normal human being with eyes and ears that can make opinions for himself? Why does his view of trump have to do anything with his view of msm? You keep linking these but it doesn’t make sense..... do you only like trump because the media doesn’t like him? </p>

<p>And trump seems like he was great friends with Hillary before the campaign, does that mean they still like each other now? You’re argument is essentially that if you like someone in one role, than you can’t dislike them in another role? Have you ever had a co-worker that was cool prior to getting a leadership role, than you fucking hated them? But how could you change your opinion if you liked him as a coworker?  </p>

<p>I know this is a winless debate for both of us but trying to claim someone’s views aren’t authentic just because you don’t like them is a very weak argument and easy to see through, “anyone who doesn’t like trump can’t possibly feel that way on their own, it must be MSM brainwashing that makes them feel that way”...... it’s ignoring the fact that people can just authentically not like trump, it doesn’t have to be tied to MSM at all... the only reason they are being linked like this so often is just because it’s easier for the trump base to deny how bad this dumpster fire really is if they think no one actually dislikes the guy...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an under explored conspiracy around these parts. <em>Something</em> happened to Eminem. Not only does he not act natural, he doesn&#39;t act and seem human sometimes. After his song and the video for &quot;Most&quot; came out, which alluded to the 9/11 conspiracy, he overdosed and was on hiatus for 5 years. Then he came back and was <em>completely</em> different. As a huge fan for many years, all I can tell you is that it&#39;s a gut instinct thing. I&#39;m wouldn&#39;t go all the way out on that limb without having all the facts, but there is just something that does not seem right about him and his whole situation. He has only been seen and/or photographed with his daughter <em>once</em> since 2009.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eminem was always an industry puppet.</p>

<p>By the time he came out, gangster rap had exploded in mainstream culture. Something like 75% of NWA&#39;s records were bought by white kids.</p>

<p>Eminem, like the Beastie Boys in the 80s, was a gateway for suburban white kids to feel ok about liking what is typically seen as &#39;black music&#39;.</p>

<p>Dr Dre isn&#39;t the devil, he&#39;s just a useful idiot who helped the major labels infiltrate and take over the underground rap scene. Behind him, Jimmy Iovine has always been the brains of their operation and above that is labels like Def Jam which is owned by Universal Music, which is owned by Vivendi, from France.</p>

<p>Billionaires own the music industry. Between the late 80s and early 90s, they conspired to destroy or overtake the independent music industry. Old School 80s rap was socially conscious, politically active, and combined with other underground genres like punk rock &amp; metal, it would have been a force to reckon with, which is why it was subversively taken over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Music Industry. Emphasis on the Industry part.</p>

<p>Anyone can make music. How you distribute it is the major thing. If you have no way to sell or market your music, you make no money.</p>

<p>Back in the late 70s, punk rock came out as a short lived trend. This inspired a bunch of kids to make their own music and distribute it themselves and start their own labels. The DIY independent music scene developed internationally as a result.</p>

<p>Due to networking between small labels, bands, venues, promoters, independent record stores, and fans, it started growing and by the late 80s, became fairly popular. Top 40 music was fairly awful and independent music gave people an alternative to mainstream major label music.</p>

<p>&#39;Alternative&#39; music was actually named because it&#39;s an alternative to mainstream music, not because of it&#39;s &#39;counter-culture&#39; image. That was mostly just a label attached to indie bands after big box stores were allowed to sell independent music.</p>

<p>When the Parental Advisory warning labels were put on music albums, that whole thing was an industry scam to peddle &#39;smut&#39; to kids, and to undermine the indie music scene by taking over distribution. Big box stores didn&#39;t sell indie music which was loaded with swears and violent imagery so the major labels couldn&#39;t distribute it unless they put the warning labels on the albums.</p>

<p>They even got Jello Biafra, the lead singer of the Dead Kennedy&#39;s and owner of the Alternative Tentacles record label to go on Oprah defending them even though they were trying to muscle in on the stuff him and others had built.</p>

<p>Since like 1992 the music industry has been pretty much owned by the big labels who just buy out any competition because they own all the modes of distribution and have more abilities to market their artists than any indie band could ever do on their own.</p>

<p>Sure, there&#39;s the internet but that&#39;s still a limited market. The majors have access to tv, radio, movies, billboards, internet, you name it. They can promote a bag of dicks and make it famous if they really wanted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve put your finger on the problem. Ever since the rise of <em>Fox News</em>, everyone has a different understanding of the words -- so different, that we are not even communicating anymore. It&#39;s amazing how one little oligarch network can so effectively <em>brainwash</em> so many people. We did not speak in most of these terms before 1996. Sure, a few fringe reactionaries did, but they were widely dismissed (and for good reason, but that&#39;s a whole other commentary). Your understanding is as good I suppose (or more accurately as bad) as some of the others I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>But then we need to throw the language in the garbage. </p>

<p>What you are, most likely, is called &quot;moderate&quot; -- and a strange one at that, as everything on your list that would not be liberal comes directly from recent Republican propaganda.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go back as far as the Ronald Reagan years for a better understanding of these words:</p>

<p>Leftist -- communist or socialist entities like Daniel Ortega, Fidel Castro or the Sandanistas.</p>

<p>Rightist -- authoritarian powerful dictators like Idi Amin, Francisco Franco, or Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p>Liberal -- those favoring government regulation and programs for people, and those tolerant of diverse ethnicities or religions.</p>

<p>Conservative -- those favoring large businesses and wealthy people, and those not tolerant of diversity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an absurdly powerful, ungrounded statement to make, and even a nonreligious person like myself should be able to recognize that. I agree with your premise, but your conclusion that &quot;the devil isn&#39;t real,&quot; is non sequitur at best.*  Even if <em>no</em> forms of the devil actually do exist, your account does not take into consideration the existence of the concept of the Devil in the minds of, often influencial, men. Who&#39;s to say that Marshall Mathers doesn&#39;t honestly believe that he has sold his soul (or, moral and creative integrity) to the likes of Lucifer, Satan, Baal, Osiris/Isis, Moloch, and their respective church/es? </p>

<p><em>In case the reader questions my use of &quot;non sequitur&quot;, Wikipedia *currently</em> defines/describes it by stating, &quot;Often, in fact, &#39;non sequitur&#39; is used when an irrelevancy is showing up in the conclusion. It is the act of introducing a neutral topic to divert attention away from the main topic of discussion.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can just tell he&#39;s grasping on to his fame rn. I mean yeah, his thing was always questioning government, constant lines against Clinton and parents who allow their kids to watch violent movies then blame rappers for violence and drugs, etc. but he has completely flipped from claiming that him being white was holding him back. Now he claims that him being white has helped him. It does get pretty annoying when he goes from making fun of Vanilla Ice and Backstreet Boys and is now working with Ed Sheeran, Pink, and Beyonce (which honestly those songs are the best ones on this album). His holier than thou attitude is really annoying considering he said, &quot;Fuck that take drugs, rape sluts, make fun of gay clubs, men who wear makeup, get aware wake up. Get a sense of humor.&quot; I will admit I like some of his newer songs. I may not agree with them but some of the lines are good and I still like that at least he&#39;s talking about raping people and kidnapping Ivanka Trump lol.</p>

<p>I still think he&#39;s actually gay tho</p>

<p>On a side note, saw Kid Rock in Vegas recently and noticed a lot of devil horn gestures over his head. Love Kid Rock. Could just be a rock thing, or possibly a bit more. Hmmm..</p>

<p>However, in his case,  there&#39;s a bigger problem that followed, if he wants to stay relevant instead of fading into obscurity, because it means he&#39;s got to keep associating with people less and less mature than him. Teen/Rap angst is not very satisfying for those approaching the days of being senior citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those songs definitely creep me out. Hollywood has made me feel torn between believing the devil exists or the industry is so messed up that it&#39;s a euphemism. With all the things I&#39;ve been reading I believe it really is the devil.</p>

<p>So many artists spoke about this. Some even spoke about them signing a contract in their own blood. I believe once you sign over there really is no quitting and they&#39;re puppets from then on.</p>

<p>I was also reading about how when people enter freemasonry they have to give a blood oath.</p>

The rap world and other music and entertainment realms USE that messed up stuff to fuel further feelings of superiority and disconnection from each other. Him knowing deep down that we should love our neighbor, him even being near rap or any Hollywood stuff was a metaphorical selling of the soul.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think he just got older and changed. He sort of surrounded himself with yes men and Hollywood types, had a drug addiction and just fell off.</p>

<p>I went back and listened to his earlier albums not long ago and they are classics, but how much of that is down to it being reminiscent of childhood and for many their first taste of hip hop I don&#39;t know. Now I kind of feel he is overrated and was just a stereotypical product of the 90&#39;s and OHMG SHOCKING stuff.</p>

<p>I credit him with getting me into hip hop when I was a teen and have been heavily into hip hop since, but aside from going back to listen to his older stuff after Revival dropped as a comparison, I&#39;ve literally never bumped his stuff by choice, especially like I would other classics and 90&#39;s era stuff. I think that&#39;s most telling for me personally.</p>
