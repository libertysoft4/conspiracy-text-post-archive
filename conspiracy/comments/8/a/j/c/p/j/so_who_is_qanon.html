<p>Do you have a couple examples? I haven&#39;t really paid attention to Q in a while, but everything I remember was cryptic and just vague enough that people could always find some real life event that matched up to it without actually knowing if that&#39;s what the original prediction was about.

<p>This is too big a chunk to bite on. I called the evangelical twist to Q about the first week he was on-stage. That&#39;s a deep dive into exceptionalism, and frankly millenialism. Religion can be a volatile force in societies for sure.</p>

<p>Theres the strange dogwhistly christian patriotism thing VotL and others parrot out to the wider twitter/fb universe which at least from some comments I’ve seen has been well regarded by some here in US. Yet even those keys draw energy in locally, China for example just censored online sales of the bible..</p>
