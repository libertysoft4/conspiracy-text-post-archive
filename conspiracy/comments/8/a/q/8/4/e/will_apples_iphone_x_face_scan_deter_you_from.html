    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t use an apple phone even if someone gave it to me for free with or without facial scanner. It&#39;s crazy how stuff gets rehashed every year with essentially the same functions but a brand spanking new price tag. It&#39;s almost like these companies have found a way to get people to keeping buying the same older priced gadget every mining their pockets with cash. Admittedly though I have a Note 8 though because my LG got so old it pretty much died completely. I mean the Note 8 is nice an all but I still do the same exact shit I did with my 5 year old LG. So why the $1000 price tag? Ridiculousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said this before and I will keep saying it again. The Facial Recognition feature on the iPhone X js their way of harvesting people&#39;s faces in one giant database which is then compromised to the CIA and other secret service agencies. I have an s8+ that is pretty new and working great, and now just a month ago samsung released the s9/s9+ which was very quick. I never understood what was the point trying to keep up with &quot;upgrades&quot; if your current phone is working just fine? And we all know the upgrades are bullshit half the time, barely anything changes from one phone to another. They just want to keep the people in this cyclical loop of hyperconsumerist culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man.  I never plan that far ahead. I really don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have an option for wired headset. Hopefully, by then, technology would’ve improved battery life, which is my main gripe about it. I do have a pair of pretty decent BT headphones, but I only use them at home. They’re big around the ear types. I use earbuds when I’m out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought I would be ok with Bluetooth headsets and speakers but honestly it’s one more thing to keep charged and to maintain.   I’ve had a few headsets already where I didn’t use them for a month and the battery was too far gone to come back so they were junked.    I prefer an option to plug in for the best quality and least hassle with sharing music with friends.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one of my biggest issues (or advantages depending on your perspective) with the iPhone X facial recognition system often gets overlooked. Sure, they probably use that biometric data and store it elsewhere for future use. But what I often think of is how when I first got a cell phone, any agency could access my data but you couldn’t necessarily verify that it was actually me using the phone at that time. That’s because access to unlock a device was either just the push of a button or simple passcode to gain entry. Now with the massive push by the industry for added security features via fingerprint scanning or facial recognition, every time that phone is unlocked it’s practically verifying that is is indeed me who is searching these phrases, visiting these sites, at this location, taking these photos, and are texting/calling/emailing these people. It’s an excellent tool for tracking our movement and tendencies with a built-in confirmation system of user identity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow... Very good point. I need to think on this for awhile. The ability to plausibly deny that you were the one using a device is pretty important. I always just assumed if questioned about something shady, someone could just say “It was somebody else”. I guess one should keep in mind that if you are going to do something questionable, you should probably have a secondary device, preferably without biometrics.</p>
