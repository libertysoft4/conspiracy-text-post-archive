<p>All mainstream media including Sinclair, Fox, CNN are all controlled by the establishment and oligarchs. </p>

<p>The Sinclair video was propaganda against independent media and promoting MSM. This was not right or left wing propaganda. This was establishment narrative vs independent journalism.  </p>

<p>If you look at the comment section you can see that it is all about which flavor of establishment narrative propaganda you favor. But hey, I guess at least our masters allow us to choose which propaganda flavor we want right?</p>

<p>Because right now it seems like you felt the need to make yet another post complaining about CNN (who are reprehensible, as are all media) in what can only be described as a bout of whataboutism apparently with the aim of taking the discussion off of Sinclair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We had about 8000-9000 &quot;people&quot; (mostly bots) logging in here around the clock for several weeks.  Our typical amount was closer to 2000-3000 the day before they showed up.  There were also <em>alot</em> more people than usual spamming msm talking point comments and posts during that time.</p>

<p>They all suddenly logged off a few days ago, shortly after the youtube shooting, and many of the spammiest commenters suddenly just dropped off the radar at the same time.  What a coincidence, eh?  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think some of that was just because the Sinclair issue and the related posts here and in other subs were on the front page, naturally leading more people here? Before I get accused of being a shill or one of them, let&#39;s just say there is a botnet but the botnet+shills = 4000 and then there was 1000 regular extra people from the front page(using your 5000 figure).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  They were here long before the Sinclair news.  They showed up somewhere between L.V. and Parkland shootings.  Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t paying close enough attention to catch the precise date of the massive increase in &quot;users&quot;.</p>

<p>Another interesting note was that we used to get user spikes after big events, like shootings, Sinclair, etc.  But while the botnet was logged in, there weren&#39;t very big spikes any more.  They were just <em>always</em> here.  It&#39;s strange too, that shortly after the youtube shooting (when you would expect a spike in users), we actually had the <em>massive</em> dropoff of accounts logged in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say it had anything to do with the shooting, directly.  That&#39;s just when the botnet suddenly disappeared.  Having a bunch of the most notorious and obvious shills drop off at the exact same time as the botnet is the &quot;coincidence&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a pretty concerted effort to disseminate information about the most common <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">shilling tactics</a> and call them out when they were being used, along with frequent comments exposing the use of vote bots. There was also a lot of effort put into psychological warfare of demoralizing shills indirectly by mocking them, calling them impotent losers, and so on, which causes them to become unhinged and get banned, quit their jobs, or write even worse quality bullshit.</p>

<p>Normal people don&#39;t deserve to be treated like that, so it&#39;s important to keep the mockery and demoralization to general comments about shills. It&#39;s also important to focus on the way someone is using disinformation tactics, rather than calling them a shill, because many of the people that are brigading us actually aren&#39;t professionals, they&#39;re coming from places like topminds.</p>

<p>I think they finally realized they were actually waking a bunch of people up to the prevalence of shilling (frequent posts about it hitting the front page even when heavily downvoted by bots) and gave up.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see if they come back, and we&#39;ll be ready if they do. But I think we won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad my comment got vote-botted and then you made the exact same derailing comment I frequently see when talking about shills here.

<p>You&#39;re trying to imply a partisan motivation and get everyone focused on Republicans vs. Democrats instead of the provable fact that our own government comes in here to disrupt the discussion, and we caught them.

<p>That being said, softies like you use that fact to disengage from any and all conversation when you feel the slightest bit uncomfortable. Keep thinking you’re “winning” by getting users who disagree with you banned. That’s fine. All you and the conclave are really doing is creating a group of people that will go against you no matter what because you are unjustly getting them banned. You only think critical thinking exists when it agrees with your biases. You only think someone is a shill if they push back against your viewpoint. If you struggle to have positive and productive conversations with people, regardless of their view in relation to yours, maybe you’re the problem. The conclave doesn’t want a place for people to think critically and engage in open conversation. They want a place where everyone circlejerks over their viewpoint. I can’t remember the last time I’ve read a productive conversation between two people because it always devolves into a shit flinging contest. Telling some their should “go back to tmor” isn’t a valid argument. It doesn’t make you right. It doesn’t make you a winner. </p>

<p>I understand this is upsetting to the people who want to disrupt everything, but the real users are completely galvanized in their disgust with the level of shilling here, and posts about it regularly hit the front page even when opposed by vote bots.

<p>In any public forum, make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded, or simply ignore any answer. This works extremely well in Internet and letters-to-the-editor environments where a steady stream of new identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism, reasoning — simply make an accusation or other attack, never discussing issues, and never answering any subsequent response, for that would dignify the opponent’s viewpoint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have been replying with this same (or slightly edited) comment to anyone who goes against you and the moderators&#39; narrative for weeks. Your posts are a perfect example of topic dillution from your handbook:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a ‘gossip mode.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The conversations you are detracting from are important. They often speak of the moderators&#39; attempts at vanishing the evidence and witnesses (through bans and removals):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vanish evidence and witnesses. If it does not exist, it is not fact, and you won’t have to address the issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those that don&#39;t go along with the moderators&#39; narrative, this is eerily close to a full control situation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings – and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the ‘ultimate victory’ as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the gist of that top comment was the Conan thing wasnt political. The Sinclair stuff was. Those affiliates bought fluff stories to talk about to fill air time. On the other hand, Sinclair is buying up stations to push stories that are good for Trump. And it doesn&#39;t look good that Trump wants even less regulation for this type of thing. At the end, he says the consolidation of media outlets in general is a terrible thing. And there should be rules about this, regardless of whether you&#39;re pushing politics or fluff stories. Obviously that post hit r/all so thats part of why the comment got so many upvotes and got gilded. </p>

<p>Can you tell me what was political about the Sinclair stuff? </p>

<p>This is an honest question. I&#39;ve listened to it 100 times and the only thing it references is &quot;fake news&quot; and how it&#39;s hurting our democracy. Fake news is not political. Hurting out democracy shouldn&#39;t be an issue only one party cares about. These are issues that effect (and are perpetrated) by both sides. Pretending this is a one sided is naive, at best. </p>

So even though in a vacuum the message reads somewhat tame,  distribution of a must run segment “alerting” viewers to “fake news” which our president decries is anything negative published by cnn, wapo, nyt, etc sends this message to all the 40+ year olds who watch the local news: “if you want to avoid dangerous fake news, stick with us, your trusted privately owned Sinclair station”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump offering the support of Sinclair is not proof that Sinclair was acting on behalf of Trump. Plenty of people do things that I praise, are all those people acting on my behalf?</p>

<p>Did Trump use this to continue his push about fake news? Absolutely. Is that proof of anything? Only that Trump never let&#39;s am opportunity go to waste, good or bad. </p>

<p>What you&#39;re saying is, basically, the parkland shooter was acting on behalf of the democrats. I mean they were quick to use it to push their narrative, after all. And if that is good enough proof for Sinclair/Trump then it needs to be good enough in all instances. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not even saying you&#39;re wrong, I&#39;m saying there is no evidence to support the claim. I believe the MSM colludes with the DNC but I rarely make that claim because there is little hard evidence to support it (outside of Donna B)</p>

If the local station runs it, They&#39;ll get paid for the piece. If they do tgeir own without the embedded ad, they don&#39;t. So while not being forced from the top down, the incentive is too good to pass up in an industry hurting for money. </p>

<p>Yes I edited my post several times, glad you noticed. Care to respond to the points I added?</p>

<p>Otherwise, so what, it wasn&#39;t done with any nefarious intent. I was interrupted several times and had to come back to it and I have OCD which compels me to write and edit and write and edit ad nauseum. It&#39;s annoying to a lot of people but therapeutic to me. I&#39;m gonna go right now and add an &quot;Edited to some shit&quot; at the end. Cool?</p>

<p>why did you write that I edited my post &quot;A LOT&quot; in caps?</p>

<p>Because you tripled (random guess) your comment size with the edits. I did not mean to imply with my capitalization that I thought it was done nefariously so I apologize if it was interpreted that way. It also didn&#39;t help that I was on my phone app when I first saw the comment edits. </p>

<p><strong>Attention shills</strong>: everyone knows what you&#39;re doing.

    <div class="md"><p>CNN and the likes, as well as Sinclair sucks and are controlled by oligarchs. </p>

<p>Heres the thing. You were debated and downvoted if you said that in the thread. You couldn&#39;t even propose that they&#39;re all controlled and don&#39;t watch them. I know because I did, and they had their trolls spam me links that Fox news is the worst and Sinclair&#39;s propaganda is unprecedented. You cannot lump all the bad guys together without a band of accounts automatically shifting the blame to the right on this sub. It&#39;s pretty obvious now.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of the stuff that gets upvoted to the top reflects a normal userbase, but the comments are an entirely different scenario. I think a lot of users checked out of commenting and just became lurkers because something funky is going on but there&#39;s nothing you can do about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CNN and the likes, as well as Sinclair sucks and are controlled by oligarchs. </p>

<p>Heres the thing. You were debated and downvoted if you said that in the thread. You couldn&#39;t even propose that they&#39;re all controlled and don&#39;t watch them. I know because I did, and they had their trolls spam me links that Fox news is the worst and Sinclair&#39;s propaganda is unprecedented. You cannot lump all the bad guys together without a band of accounts automatically shifting the blame to the right on this sub. It&#39;s pretty obvious now.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of the stuff that gets upvoted to the top reflects a normal userbase, but the comments are an entirely different scenario. I think a lot of users checked out of commenting and just became lurkers because something funky is going on but there&#39;s nothing you can do about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what comment got vote botted? the one above? its at negative 5. someone made a bot network consisting of 5 bots?</p>

<p>i only mention cambridge analytica because of the hilarious response i get from people who are terrified and hateful of shills, as long as theyre on one side of the aisle. seems you guys always forget about cambridge analytica</p>

<p>meanwhile, constantly say things like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Republicans vs. Democrats instead of the provable fact that our own government comes in here to disrupt the discussion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol you could have just agreed but you had to go right wing on me</p>

<p>These are even more egregious and masquerade as paid programming for a 3rd party. Which allows them to express even more controversial subjects.</p>
