        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before 1939: Jews heavily subduegated by humanity for centuries..... This subduegation reached its max with the Holocaust (concentration camps, annhilation etc.)</p>

<p>1944: in erstwhile palastine only few scattered Jewish settlements (the jews bought private property in specific). The Jews were dubious. Even though they owned less than 1% of the land, they dotted the coast of the Mediterranean owning a lot of harbours. Aside from this, they bought properties roughly stretching from the coast to Jerusalem (making a &quot;bridge&quot; of Jewish land from the coast to Jerusalem). So even though they didn&#39;t have much land, they had important areas. And the palastinians had no idea of this insidious tactic of the Jews. This systematic purchase of vital private property was happening irrespective of the Zionist revolution.</p>

<p>1945-1947: Zionist revolution+ establishment of Israel (through cheeky sophistry)</p>

<p>Thus was Israel established. In the same way the Jews of today, even though they&#39;re less than 2% of the world&#39;s population, own an outstanding 96% of the world&#39;s media, the biggest investors are jewish and Israel is a frightful dominator in not only Western Asia, but around the world. Mossad (Israeli intelligence organization) is just..... Incredibly powerful.</p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook (biggest social media. Owns Instagram and Whatsapp. basically the internet. Social media culture has taken over the minds of the youth. Literally. Most of us are slaves to it)</p>

<p>Larry Page: Google</p>

<p>Sergey Brin: also Google.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and Google. Aka: most of the internet</p>

<p>Porn industry is massively Jewish. The upsurge of insest porn being suggested, is no &quot;innocent&quot; outcome of the website&#39;s algorithm. It&#39;s a direct attack on the weak minds of children. (Al Goldstein, art Garfunkel,)</p>

<p>Jews have an average IQ of 112. (R Lynn - Personality and Individual Differences, 2004 - Elsevier)</p>

<p>Harvey Weinstein (ex powerful King pin in Hollywood)</p>

<p>Even though Weinstein has been taken down, there&#39;s still several incredibly powerful Jews in Hollywood. Among actors and producers. In fact, if you look it up, Hollywood was in fact &quot;started&quot; almost completely by Jews.</p>

<p>Even though the president of the USA isn&#39;t Jewish, he&#39;s Senior Chief advisor, Jared Kushner is.</p>

<p>The Rothschilds (mad rich investors. Own more than $2 trillion dollars in assets). The amount of money they have is outright obscene.</p>

<p>The list honestly goes on. If you look at a chart that represents median annual house old income across different religious groups in the United States, The Jews earn the most   ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_and_religion#/media/File:Income_Ranking_by_Religious_Group_-_2000.png">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_and_religion#/media/File:Income_Ranking_by_Religious_Group_-_2000.png</a> ) . After Israel, the United States of America has the largest Jewish population. More than 7.2 million (enlarged) Jewish population. Looking at Israel&#39;s med-ann household income would be pointless so the country without a majority Jewish population but having the largest non Israeli community of Jews is a valid basis for my assumption.</p>

<p>Now we must not forget that [biblically (old testament as the centre piece of Abrahamic religions) speaking], God&#39;s chosen people were originally Jewish. Sure, so were all the children of Abraham, but the Jews were special, and the hatred of gentiles towards them has been almost constant throughout relevant history.</p>

<p>The journey (isra) of El (god) to take his people (Jews) away from their promised land had come full circle with the formation of Israel. The Israelites are testament to that fact.</p>

<p>The Jews disregard Jesus, and unlike Islam or Christianity, consider you a legitimate Jew if you have converted. The Israelites also possessed the arc of the covenant and everyone who stood up to them perished at the hands of this instrument. Moses the Jew, and even Jesus Christ himself where born to this faith. Through history, the Jews more than others, have been spoken to by God. They have been told that their suffering is their own fault in accordance to their faith, and suffer they did at the hands of man. This stinging hatred that mankind has had towards god&#39;s chosen people....</p>

<p>Not to forget a LOT of the world&#39;s most incredible artists and scientists have been and still continue to be, Jewish. I mean sure the rabbit hole is endless and a lot of the data is generalised and can be associated with humans in general.... but at the same time, i feel like we should look into this more? Idk, i feel like i&#39;m on the verge of being anti semitic, which i don&#39;t (necessarily) want to be, but then again this isn&#39;t as much against the semites as it is just presenting some data about the jews. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simply, no. Because for every jew with lots of power, there are lots of jews with none, and what do they have to do with anything? Makes no sense to drag up all these millions of people just trying to live their lives and start blaming them for shit they never did. So, don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I mean even apart from being nasty and stupid and dangerous, it&#39;s also counter-productive. If you think e.g. the Rothschilds are turbo-bastards, and hey they&#39;re jewish too, so you complain about &#39;the jews&#39; - well congrats, you&#39;ve made sure those Rothschilds don&#39;t have to take any responsibility. You&#39;ve taken whatever blame they might deserve, and splashed it around millions of people you don&#39;t even know who don&#39;t have anything to do with anything. What&#39;s the point of that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you go to articles regarding &quot;white Privelege&quot; and use this argument? Im guessing not.</p>

<p>White peoples social and financial status in the world is NOWHERE near as obscene as the Jews. Their disproportionate power can be attributed to being the racial majority in the countries with majority white leadership.</p>

<p>But their is no legitimate reason for 2% of the population, a single racial group to control such vast amounts of wealth and have such political and corporate influence </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not lately, no. There was a time, though, sure. Still got KotakuInAction up there in my most-visited subs.</p>

<p>And it is the exact same argument, ie don&#39;t lump people together and blame them for shit they never did, it doesn&#39;t help. I don&#39;t really understand how you can reject it in one case on the basis that it can also apply in other cases. If you&#39;re saying &#39;white people don&#39;t have as much as jews it&#39;s unfair&#39;, how can you argue with someone saying &#39;black people don&#39;t have as much as white people, it&#39;s unfair&#39;? There is something other than reason at work, I wager.</p>

<p>The point is that &#39;a single racial group&#39; does not control vast anything, because racial groups are concepts, they don&#39;t have minds or hands or bank accounts or any of the things they would need to do that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s people, just people. If you&#39;re mad about some people, and your response is to blame the racial group that those people belong to, you are <em>letting the actual people</em> off the hook, and why would you do that.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I assume this is a typo.  In the major sects of Judaism you need to be born of a Jewish mother.  Maybe you are referring to the Reform Movement?</p>

<p>I personally think that all religion is just a way for TPTB that keep people compliant - to teach that obeying is the natural state of the human being.  </p>

<p>As an &quot;ethnic group&quot;, it is undeniable that Jews are more successful than most.  I think that plays a lot into them being the &quot;boogeyman&quot; - success makes enemies.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re saying the &quot;Jews have too much power&quot;. What do you mean by &quot;too much&quot;?</p>

<p>I am very sorry I can&#39;t tell you how Jews became as influential as their are today. Since my skills in English don&#39;t reach to a point were I am able to explain you the theory. If you are by any chance very fluent in German. I could help you out though.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not fluent in German. I can still help you with these particular steps.</p>

<p>Please check your sources and inform yourself about what kind of jobs they were forced in throughout time. After you read about that. Read &quot;Das Kapital&quot; by Marx you might want to buy a guide to understand all of it by reading Marx you get a very good understanding how finances work and you get a clearer view how they were literally forced in these position.  If you have done that. Read Books about &quot;antisemitism throughout time&quot;. This is very helpful since you&#39;ll see thinking patterns you might have adapted to your own by reading disguised antisemitic lecture. Not saying you&#39;re an Antisemit, but it&#39;s important to get as many counterarguments against your own thesis as you can get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>K good to hear, you know how money accumulates then. Since the 12th century, in Europe, the only one allowed to trade in goods/money with interest, were Jews. Since then Jewish family business was around. What was going around too was the compound interest within these family buisnesses, which allowed some Jewish families to accumulate really great wealth throughout time. Money in our capitalistic world means influence. The religion can just be seen as coincidence here. There is no plan to rule the world by a secret agenda. Or anything like that. Nearly the whole humanity thrives for success and if we make money we want it to grow. The reason for that urge we have lies in something primal - The need of security. You know that it you got money, you can get food, get shelter and clothes for keeping you warm. Simply put you get to survive. And survival is the most basic thing nearly all humans pursue. So I can&#39;t come up and say &quot;The Jews are making too much money, they get way too much influence in the world&quot;, if I know for a fact, I want to make a lot of money for my own security and if I had any I would want to keep it and make more of it to extend the wish for my own security to my family and the people I like. 
I think that&#39;s just how it works basically it&#39;s all about the money and there&#39;s no reason to defame a religious group so oneself can get a advantage out of it. </p>

<p>And this is where you go off the rails. There is nothing insidious about investing in a profitable venture. You are holding their success against them the same way minorities do to whites. </p>

<p>We should acknowledge that they have power and call them out on misusing it, but not resent them simply for acuireing the power. After all that is exactly what we are all trying to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who was raised Jewish, I used to think the claim about Jewish power was an anti-semitic canard. But what I&#39;ve discovered over the last few years, to my deep regret, is that it is very, very true. However, most Jews are unaware of it and suffer from a deep-seated sense of persecution, which enables them to look away from the truth. There is a relatively small clique of very wealthy Jewish families who control the entire world at this time. Most of them are not recognized as Jewish because they adopt other religions in order to fit in. I&#39;m pretty sure they don&#39;t believe in Judaism or Jewish values, or at least nothing that I would recognize as such. They may have another belief system entirely an simply hide behind the cloak of Jewishness. It&#39;s possible. They are responsible for stirring up anti-semitism and also for working to discredit any and all criticism of Jewish power as anti-semitism. So don&#39;t be afraid to explore evidence and conclusions that you are worried will be viewed as anti-semitic. That&#39;s what they want. If you want to learn more, you can read my research paper on <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/dreyfus.pdf">The Dreyfus Affair.</a></p>

<p>Your post really only scratches the very surface of the power of wealthy Jews in terms of its history and its extent. If you want to learn more, you should read the work of Miles Mathis. Go to <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/updates.html">his updates page,</a> scroll down to his 2013 paper on Theosophy and the Beat Generation and read forward from there. The discoveries he makes along the way build on one another, and they have rocked me to the core, challenging many of my most dearly held beliefs.</p>

<p>Just please don&#39;t hate all Jews as a result. Most are as well-meaning as you are, and the vast majority are in the dark about all the things that the very elite among them are up to. They have been stepped on and used as tools for centuries to enable a powerful few to conquer the world.   </p>
