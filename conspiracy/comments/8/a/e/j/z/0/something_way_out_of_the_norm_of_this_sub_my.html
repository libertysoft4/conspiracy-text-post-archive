        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Twitch.tv is essentially live-youtube for gamers which amazon bought out a year or two ago for almost $1B. If you want to read more about this company welcome to google it. </p>

<p>The difference on this site compared to youtube is</p>

<ul>
<li><p>followers = people who just simply follow the page(youtube subscribe)</p></li>
<li><p>subscribers = people who pay $5/mo to support the streamer(popular streamers get atleast $3.50 of that $5, some get more if they have a private deal with twitch)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway onto the theory.</p>

<p>There has been a major battle between two major games of the same genre(Survival-shooter) PUBG and Fornite which you most likely heard of. </p>

<p>Ninja has been a streamer/pro gamer for a while so his initial fame and viewership is not to be forgotten about, but when he switched from PUBG &gt; Fornite this kid exploded. I mean like nothing the world has seen.</p>

<p>He is close to approaching 250k subscribers, which 2nd place on that list has 50k. <a href="https://twitchstats.net/real-sub-count">https://twitchstats.net/real-sub-count</a>. (250k *$3.5/sub =875k$ NOT INCLUDING AD REVENUE AND DONATIONS)</p>

<p>He suddenly is the most watched streamer on twitch in a short span, where even DRAKE and other A-list celebs played with him</p>

<p>How did he do it? Simple he didnt. Fornite creators paid for all of this to happen.</p>

<p>With the power that twitch has to turn a game from 0 to multi-billion dollar(PUBG is the rag to riches story because of twitch)it seems only natural that eventually a company would be like &quot;If we have one really popular streamer, everyone will flock to this game&quot;</p>

<p>Which they did. Now Fornite, who used to be a small contender to PUBG has now overgrown its competitor in the past 3 months, right around the time that yes, Ninja started to stream Fornite.</p>

<p>I believe that Fornite creators are paying people like drake(the singer) to play with Ninja(obviously, the never played again and for 2 days it was all that twitter could talk about) AND are paying for the subscribers on his channel(most likely bot accounts that can get Sub&#39;d and yes these exists because I used to run a twitch botting site and I had fake subs that I sold $3)</p>

<p>Just recently a popular stream-boosting website closed its doors that I had connections with <a href="http://streamboosters.com/">http://streamboosters.com/</a> and I wondered why? I know the guy made 100k/month botting various streamers on twitch. </p>

<p>Because this guys is 100% delegating all his botting resources to boosting Ninja subscriber, viewer, and follower count. They went All in on one streamer, rather than multiple because they realized they can make way more money with 1 streamer that very popular than many mediocre popular streamers.</p>

<p>How much could this boosting service make from switching from multiple streamer to 1 streamer? Who knows, if Fornite devs approached them and gave them a lump sum and or sold their  product(it was 100% homebrewed, twitch admins/devs could never touch this guy)</p>

<p>If they were going off their normal 30% rate the they gave alot of their streamers, Minimum $300k/month which is 200k$ more than he was previously making. At this point Ninja is making a cool $1million+ dollars A MONTH.</p>

<p><strong>Theory:</strong> Ninja is being botted beyond your wildest dreams and you all think its real, most likely by Fornite creators if not Ninja himself.</p>

<p>Can I prove it? No one will ever be able to prove it. With a influx of fake and real viewers and how bots works(private proxies,vpns,vps&#39;s) twitch raking in so much good revenue and publicity itll be like this forever. The parties involved are making so much cash that it will go like this forever, especially with literally 0 regulation from the twitch admins(who are super corrupt by the way, just do a quick google search about it) The twitch bots are so sophisticated now you cannot tell real from fake.</p>

<p>Edit: as an extra tip, i would bet they found a loop-hole on Twitch-Amazon prime free subscription where if you have a trial of Amazon Prime(hence free) you can sub to a streamer on twitch for free. IF a bug/loop hole was found they could in theory create unlimted free subscriptions for Ninja. </p>

Because you&#39;re not interesting mate, to put it bluntly. Nobody gives a shit about what happened when you went to the grocery store yesterday.
On the other side, you have this swole manlet mutt that&#39;s very good at the game milions of people are playing, that roid-rages everytime he messes up, that&#39;s funny and has a unique personality. 
While you described yourself as normal. Nobody gives a shit about normal, regular people. By definition, normal is the majority. </p>

<p>To expand further, you&#39;re replaceable. His insanity isn&#39;t. He saw the opportunity and wen&#39;t for it. You didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>For all we know, you might have some in-human talent nobody knows about. You never discovered or developed it. He did. </p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s a bit fishy. I thought tyler&#39;s 30k on average is huge, but apparently ninja gets 100k+, right? </p>

<p>I still don&#39;t know what to think of all this. On a one hand, the insane popularity, Drake, etc is fishy. On the other, it&#39;s a free game tons of people are playing.. basically League of Legends 2.0.</p>

<p>But still, his popularity might be too insane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok well, he has 1.3 million twitter followers, 2.1 million instagram, and 100k facebook followers.</p>

<p>A better explanation may be his 7 million youtube followers, but that itself is also following the same trend <a href="https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/ninjashyper">https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/ninjashyper</a></p>

<p>Looking through his youtube channel, he went from around 50k hits per video to millions.</p>

<p>Anyway, if this is all natural, then the best explanation I have is that he was one of the only fortnite content creators during the rise of fornite.  These numbers are still ridiculous to me in relative scale, but I&#39;ll see if this same trend occurred to other prominent fornite content creators during the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree its an interesting post and I love outside the box posts to read. But to me its just business. Its legal to pay for fake internet accounts right? Its a clever marketing gimmick. I think its good that people are aware of these tricks and don&#39;t let them influence their decisions. But in the end of the day its a company promoting its product. If you don&#39;t like the tactics, don&#39;t buy the product, don&#39;t buy the hype.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It works because people&#39;s decisions are influenced even after they know the trick, just not as much.  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s necessarily wrong, but it&#39;s firmly in gray area.  You&#39;re right, though.  It&#39;s only going to get more manipulative unless people vote with their wallets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I begun playing a few weeks ago after I heard Pardon My Take (sports podcast) and a few of my co-workers talk about it. I heard of Ninja once the drake thing happened. He’s entertaining - he’s goofy. I can see why people gravitate towards him, but if he’s got 5x the subs compared to others, I just don’t see that being organic. Manipulation from the top down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well as someone who plays fortnite 24/7. I can tell you the only reason he saw such a big spike in subscribers, was because twitch prime was offering free cosmetics for their members. Since the cosmetic/ ingame character skin was pretty neat, everyone wanted it. </p>

<p>So anyone could go make a free trial account and use a free sub on any streamer of their choice. </p>

<p>Since Ninja was already on the fortnite rise when Twitch Prime announced the offer, this is where most of the players used their free subs. </p>

<p>I know fortnite has may genuine fans, personally, I don’t get it. I absolutely can not stand that game, I really dislike it lol.</p>

<p>Is it because viewers are mostly children or what? 
I don’t understand how ‘x’ game gets super popular over others. PUBG in this case is so much better (imo) it’s not even a question.</p>

<p>Preferences I guess. I just can’t see some people playing unless they are paid too lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to this, when he was streaming with Drake, they were playing cross-platform. Ninja was on PC and Drake was on PS4. Epic Games (Fortnite Devs) set it up so that they could do this. Cross-platform is available now, but it didn&#39;t become available until a week after the Ninja/Drake event. This just adds to the theory that they went all in on Ninja. That, on top of the fact that apparently 90% of the devs were watching the stream and fixing whatever issues they were having with the gameplay and chat between the two. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I buy that. Twitch and the video game industry has to be one of the most powerful marketing relationships in economic history. You&#39;re mixing the streamer&#39;s personality, live chat in a whimsical environment with tons of active people, and learning about your hobby. God, that&#39;s powerful.</p>

<p>Especially today, where people are more and more likely to have &#39;a game&#39; than play a large amount of titles like was common in the Xbox/PS2 days. Like for me it&#39;s Starcraft, and I devote an insane amount of attention to it, but it means that I literally can&#39;t play other games. You can&#39;t go deeeeeep on multiple games, there aren&#39;t enough hours in the day. If a company can sway people into their gaming ecosystem through twitch, manipulation like this is 100% inevitable. There&#39;s just way too much potential for people not to start getting sketchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fortnite has recently become more popular than PUBG due to a few factors. It&#39;s more accessible in terms of gameplay (easier to pick up if you don&#39;t play a lot of video games). The art style also lends itself more to a casual/younger audience.  It&#39;s free, and available on more platforms than pubg. From what i understand the mobile version is doing extremely well with the &gt;18 crowd. </p>

<p>While imo PUBG is a much better game, it&#39;s a bit more obtuse than what most people are looking for.  The learning curve is steep and the gameplay is very unforgiving. I can definitely understand the appeal of Fortnite for people who don&#39;t play a lot of video games. The battle royal gamemode is a great concept which has been around for a few years now. It&#39;s just now finally being done well.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice find. It&#39;s no surprise a company would want to monopolize the game streaming industry as fast as possible. It&#39;s hugely popular. </p>

<p>Though in my opinion Fortnite was really smart on how they beat PubG. Fortnite was out last year on consoles for free getting as many players into as possible, with basically the same premise as PubG. By doing this while PubG was still only on PC and in the midst of coming to consoles Fortnite was able to sweep the popularity. </p>

<p>Add that with your discovery and they&#39;ve completely rocked the market. I just read their mobile version made $15 million it&#39;s first month. That is crazy money for a free game. </p>

<p>I saw him with 120k viewers the other day which was insane. There was no discernible reason why he would be popular. Nothing more interesting about his stream than the dozen identical ones running at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but Fortnite is just better than PUBG. Even DrDisrespect, who hated it at first, now plays it most of the time. It&#39;s mechanically superior and its developers are better at communication and bug fixes.</p>

<p>Botting on such a scale would be a huge problem for twitch. If the site became known for its massive amounts of bots, advertisers will be less inclined to pay to get advertised to essentially a much lower population than they had considered. I don&#39;t think twitch would allow this, and I think they&#39;d be extra vigilant and careful with famous streamers.</p>

<p>No way he&#39;s more popular than tyler1 or sodapoppin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s a bit fishy. I thought tyler&#39;s 30k on average is huge, but apparently ninja gets 100k+, right? </p>

<p>I still don&#39;t know what to think of all this. On a one hand, the insane popularity, Drake, etc is fishy. On the other, it&#39;s a free game tons of people are playing.. basically League of Legends 2.0.</p>

<p>But still, his popularity might be too insane. </p>

<p>Nice post <a href="/u/thepokernit">/u/thepokernit</a>. You don&#39;t see gaming conspiracies every day.</p>
