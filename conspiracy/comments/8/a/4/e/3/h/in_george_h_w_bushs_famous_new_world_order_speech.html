    <div class="md"><p>There is a social revolution masquerading as a race and a religion. There is no debating this approach as any counter-argument takes the form of racism and or religious bigotry. This struggle is laid out in the bible and is a spiritual one where those who find their identity in nations, religions or races and pledge their allegiance to princes and principalities or to the rulers of the darkness of this world will be brought to their knees. Soon, very soon, the meek will inherit the Earth. The abundance that is all around us, but consumed in political, national and other ideological conflicts will be free for all humanity. Excess food, that today is thrown away to keep from disrupting markets will feed those who go hungry.... but not before a new foundational myth is forged.... Armageddon, or the final war of nations will teach us what we are unable to see.... even though we have brought unspeakable sorrow to millions of people around the world... we seem to not really understand what we have done and are still doing. Those that do and wish to make a change find that our political system is more of an illusion than an actual instrument for self-governance or bringing about change.</p>

<p>To build a mansion where there is a shack, you have to first destroy the shack. </p>

<p>America is a vehicle of mass destruction that has been misled by ill advisers and false leaders. The people have never got what they wanted and are simply not smart enough or unified in spirit to ever affect any social change that has not been prepackaged and fed to them covertly by agent provocateurs, so that they unknowingly work against that which they think they are working for. This is because, for the most part, we are a bunch of dumb-asses and want something that is only good for some... Be thankful that our ridiculous nation with it&#39;s ridiculous holidays.... fat man in a red suit sliding down a chimney... bunnies dropping eggs and believing that the Romans killed somebody for our sins.... will meet the same fate as Rome. I&#39;s probably a good thing that this all comes to an end sooner rather than later - <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/americas-secret-war-134-countries/">before we hurt very many more people.</a> </p>

<p>American politics is very much akin to World Wide Wrestling in the 1980s. I think the Donald was even part of that nonsense....probably to give him screen time to get comfortable and for those watching to form a bond with him. Both sides are directed by a controlled narrative.. for example, <a href="http://www.pennsylvaniacrier.com/filemgmt_data/files/Biden-New%20World%20Order.pdf">here</a> is newspaper article from 1992 where future Vice President Joseph Biden declares that he has learned to love the New World Order... </p>

<p>We have entered the final phase of this revolution... buckle up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, because NWO happens all the time. An NWO created WW1, after WW1 there was a NWO, and after WW2 another NWO known as the Cold War. Then the Cold War ended and soviets fell and we were in another NWO. I think 9/11 probably signaled another one.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t think of NWO as illuminati.  Think of NWO as a shift in world order. Anytime there is a massive rebalancing of political, economic, and military power, we enter a NWO.</p>
