        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><ul>
<li><p>HIV was first identified way back in the early 1980&#39;s which is about 35 years ago.</p></li>
<li><p>Pharmaceutical businesses went to work and came up with ARV&#39;s fairly quickly. e.g. reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, fusion inhibitors etc.</p></li>
<li><p>These drugs saved lives, but were a treatment and not a cure or even preventative. </p></li>
<li><p>These drugs were incredibly profitable for Big Pharma and new ones or improved versions have been developed continuously.</p></li>
<li><p>The situation with a vaccine has been the exact opposite. No effective vaccine or vaccines that are 50 or 60% effective... against a deadly disease.</p></li>
<li><p>The reason that is always given is that the virus mutates so rapidly. So a vaccine against any particular strain will lose effectiveness as the strain mutates.</p></li>
<li><p>But certain parts of the virus must remain the same. Why? Because they need to be able to infect the T4 immune cells in the human immune system. These cells do not mutate. Think of the virus as a hand holding a key to a lock. The lock is the vulnerable site on the T4 cell... it does not change. Therefore the key (on the surface of the virus) must also stay the same.</p></li>
<li><p>So why not make a vaccine that is aimed at these conserved sites? HIV researchers have identified a number of these sites now. Some of them could no doubt be targeted by a vaccine. This would be a vaccine that would not lose it&#39;s effectiveness as the virus mutates because it would target viral sites that remain the same.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s plausible that a vaccine targeting multiple &quot;conserved sites&quot; would train the immune system to develop a strong response against any type of HIV. </p></li>
<li><p>The problem is that, if an effective vaccine (say 97%) was released. People would stop getting infected. The most vulnerable people would also be the ones most likely to sign up for the shots.</p></li>
<li><p>After a few years, the number of infections (and the number of infected people) would crash. That would eliminated the need for ARV drugs and wipe out a hugely profitable business for Big Pharma.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to get a number on how many dollars are spent each year on ARVs. But a bit of searching on Google shows that it&#39;s a multi-billion dollar/yr business. The biggest profits comes from Western countries where public health or private insurance covers the cost of extremely expensive brand name drugs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My premise is that Big Pharma has been dragging its ass coming up with a vaccine because they know an effective, safe AIDS vaccine would save people but kill their profits.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t trying to stop a vaccine from happening. But they aren&#39;t in any hurry to see it happen either. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s see what the pro vaxx people think of this one.</p>

<p>This is a good point. But think a little bit about the resources required to develop a vaccine. Who can develop an effective vaccine if not someone associated with Big Pharma?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>an immediate huge moneymaker</p>

<p>How much money (esp. over a ten or twenty year period) compared to the ARV market over a long period of time?  </p>

<p>I&#39;d event make a prediction. When those mainstream ARV drugs patent protection runs out (and you see lots of generic versions of same) <em>that&#39;s</em> when I&#39;d expect to see significant progress towards a vaccine.</p>

<p>The article I read mentioned &quot;67% effectiveness&quot;. This would likely degrade over time due to viral mutations since they only specify surface antigens and not antigens based on &quot;highly conserved&quot; regions.</p>

<p>But 67% effectiveness would help drop the number of new infections if there were widespread vaccination programs for the highest risk groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your premise has some logical flaws.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s true that financially the pharmaceutical industry as a whole may profit from having more HIV patients out there, if any one of the individual companies developed even a modestly workable vaccine,  they would make a profit on par with some of the top drugs ever (especially given how the gates foundation has infiltrated Africa and opened up the ability for private healthcare profits under the guise of &quot;NGOs&quot;). Point is, that&#39;s why all the big companies are investing huge sums in developing a vaccine.</p>

<p>So why cant they? Well, it&#39;s far more complex than you make it out to be. Here&#39;s a good article reviewing the many reasons that HIV is so difficult to vaccinate against compared to other viruses.
<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmp0806162">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmp0806162</a></p>

<p>The point is, there are several very big problems beyond simply how HIV mutates. </p>

<p>I would say as far as possible conspiracies go, this one is pretty low on the plausibility list.</p>
