    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not against formulating better vaccines or quality controls, but the planet is a giant petrie dish and vaccines are a necessary component to preserve the safety of the population.</p>

<p>Vaccines in many cases expose you to small amounts of the disease to jumpstart your bodies natural defences in order to build an immunity.</p>

<p>I am empathetic to the argument we don&#39;t fully know what these things do to ourselves and the potential threat of abuse that comes with the centralization of entities who manufacture these vaccines, but these problems are addressable and the threat to public safety these diseases pose is high.  We didn&#39;t experience life on the frontier before vaccination, losing our children to what are now treatable diseases.  We havent lived through an outbreak of cholera or polio or the Spanish flu or the bubonic plague.  Vaccination has been a net benefit for society as a whole.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a rather cynical view of the matter.  The government performed the research and licenses those patents at an incredibly low rate.  Getting vaccinations for a child costs $40 for an MMR.  It&#39;s not like they are price gouging the public.  Those fees offset the taxpayer liability to keep CDC running.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CDC isnt motivated by profit.  If they were vaccines would cost 100x more than they do.</p>

<p>Private corporations are motivated by profit, and that has caused a deleterious effect on your healthcare system on the whole.  It&#39;s unaffordable for nearly everyone in America but the exceedingly rich.  The fact we need a third party to provide insurance in order to afford treatment is a testament to that fact.  This is why a nationalized healthcare system is preferable as it takes away the motivation to profit on care.</p>

<p>Implying the CDC is motivated by profits is a stretch, but the underlying issue of a for-profit healthcare system is simply an unfortunate reality in America.</p>

<p>why do vaccines cost money. I see the arguments youre making but my point still stands, healthcare should not be profit driven, wether a private hospital or a government hospital, profits should not be sought after.

<p>They are run by private, for profit corporations.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because they cost money to produce.  There is an entire supply chain needed to produce them.</p>

<p>I agree, I dont think healthcare should run by private, for profit corporations.  There is no profit in cures and vaccines, which is why governments are the only ones who hold patents on them as a matter of public safety.  That is an unfortunate reality of the world we live in, that is dominated by private, for profit corporations dictating the prices and the entire philosophy behind healthcare in this country.  This is why there is so much emphasis on palliative care instead of cures.  The CDC isnt a private, for profit corporations.  They get $11.1B in taxpayer dollars every year to operate.</p>

<p>Why the Vaccination Status of Other Schoolchildren Is Not a Significant Risk to Immunocompromised Schoolchildren </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of people not holding up responsibilities to their societies, be it vaccinations or anything else, and none of them are punished. One could say having a job is a responsibility, but yet I know a lot of people who refuse to work or they fake a disablement to get out of it. I have no opinion really, but if we should punish people for not upholding one responsibility, then we should punish all. Correct? I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re right or wrong. This whole discussion is interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure. And for the record, yeah, they shouldnt be allowed to get away with that shit.</p>

<p>We have rule of law for a reason. Not that I&#39;m saying every law is just. But the concept of just law is real. Its definition just changes depending who you&#39;re talking to.</p>

<p>I feel like punish was a rather harsh word for me to use. Its not like I think we should imprison people en masse. Quite the contrary, prison should be avoided at all costs if there are other viable solutions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to advocate for some totalitarian regime is what I mean.</p>

<p>The &quot;punishment&quot; in itself, perhaps a better word would be deterrent? But I guess that&#39;s just a perspective issue. Nah, punishment. Let&#39;s not mince our words. The punishment, I feel, should have the added effect of benefitting those harmed by whatever actions or inactions that someone is doing or failing to do.</p>

<p>Like the vaccination issue. Don&#39;t vaccinate your child? Well then your child doesn&#39;t gain access to areas with lots of children. But then you have to be careful not to create a class of people. Total ostracism creates it own pile of other problems.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I think it should be mandatory. We should avoid at all costs letting our children die from these horrific diseases. My grandad lost 3 siblings before the age of ten. Do we want to go back to that? Hell no. But by that same token, we should avoid creating culture bubbles and promoting the creation of classes. Children shouldn&#39;t be removed from society. But if they pose a risk to others, in the form of death, well, what else can we do?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry. But sure, we don&#39;t know the full range of risks from vaccinations. But after three generations they&#39;ve had a net positive on human longevity. More people are alive than ever because of them.</p>

<p>Which leads me, since this is the place for it, to a conspiracy. The vaccines are bad narrative could be a number of things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Of racist dogma: &quot;I just hate foreigners and vaccines are the reason a lot of them are alive today. We need a culling&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Of cold economic dogma &quot;we simply cannot sustain the level of population. The quickest way to kill millions or billions of people would to bring back those big killer diseases of the past&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>I had more but this stoned rant is getting out of hand and I&#39;ve forgotten.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I mean. Is it that far fetched that there are forces in this world conspiring to kill 90% of the global population and ensure a longer lasting but smaller sized group of people survive? I mean. Its not an uncommon theory i don&#39;t think.</p>

<p>Anyways. Interesting is right. If I&#39;ve even stayed on topic... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.... I was talking specifically about people who find loopholes to get out of having a job so they can do nothing and still get paid by the taxes of working people. Please don&#39;t confuse that with someone who is forced out of a job involuntarily. I have all the sympathy in the world for someone who has a job and is a productive member of society, and then is replaced automation or just let go because the CEO made some bad financial decisions. You&#39;ll never see anyone in management take a cut in pay to prevent that from happening though.</p>
