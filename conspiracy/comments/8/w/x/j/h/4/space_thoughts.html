        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yesterday, i looked outside of my window and saw the moon. For my whole entire life i’ve seen it as “the moon”, a ball of light in the sky. It didn’t take longer before i started thinking about how beautiful it is.</p>

<p>We live on a planet, pretty much isolated from everything that happens outside of earth. Here we have so much, things that just seem normal to us like houses to live in, cars, jobs, or just a society in general, and yet we are so small. Isn’t that just amazing? </p>

<p>Sometimes, i don’t realise we just live on a ball with darkness and the unknown surrounding us, everything is nothing and nothing is everything. 
And yet we still exist</p>

<p>Look out of your window or listen to the sounds you hear and think about, how has everything come to be? </p>

<p>Are there places similiar to ours?</p>

<p>Imagine a planet like earth but 3 times as large, how does it look to you?
Are there continents?
What do the landscapes look like?</p>

<p>And if they would look out of their window or listen to the sounds they can hear, would they ask the same?</p>

<p>Another thing i find impressive is how time slows down in space. You can go to space and come back younger that your twin.
Even though time, isn’t even a thing by itself.</p>

<p>Do we matter, in the universe?</p>

<p>Are we something worth of living?</p>

<p>And who decides if we are or not?</p>

<p>What, are we?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is what really &quot;woke&quot; me up, I guess you can say. When I started studying astronomy and all that, the scale of the universe ripped my mind apart. From the littlest things, to the most massive things in the universe. It just makes you realize how trivial all the conflict and differences are on our planet are. Ultimately, at the end of the day, we&#39;re all together as one. Almost the same. But we feel as if we&#39;re all alone and different most days. For me, it&#39;s given me a new view of the world, and people in general. And it makes me feel like I can accomplish much more for some reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our natural and innate abilities are amazing and almost limitless and I believe our duty as humans is to live as if we had no boundaries in a positive, meaningful way.</p>

<p>However, our adversary Jesus desires to enslave humanity in order to “prove” to God that humans do not deserve free will just as Jesus has removed the free will from the demon subspecies.</p>

<p>So that’s the battle. You choose God and free will or Jesus and this shithole of an enslaved existence.</p>

<p>Nobody gets out alive and we vote with our lives and souls. Choose wisely. Good luck. Godspeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are very advanced for your age. Everything and nothing being the duality of existence is a big one. The Yin Yang depicts this idea perfectly. Nothing and something endlessly intertwined yet they are made out of each other. </p>

<p>Time doesnt exist outside of a perceiving entity. Our awareness bubble exists in a linear dimension where each moment gets piled on to the next. We actually exist in an infinite, nonexistant moment as contradictory as that sounds. Outside of a perceptual existence everything happens in one infinite moment. All processes of the infinite energy from negative infinity to positive infinity in a singularity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its funny how you don’t notice things like this straight away, atleast for my part. When you look at someone you don’t realise they are made from particles, like mostly everything you would see around you. </p>

<p>I question myself sometimes if space is infinite or not. If it is, how is it infinite and if it is not, what happens when you reach the edge? Do you hit an invisible wall? Will you get send back while you don’t notice and keep striving for the edge?</p>

<p>Black holes are also something that amazes me, they are not a something in a way but can let whole stars dissappear. There is so mutch possible in space and we will most likely never know what is and what is not.</p>

<p>Space amazes me, everything does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The duality is so important.  The four-valued logic system breaks it down further &quot;in which statements about the world can be (1) true, (2) not true, (3) both true and not true, and (4) neither true nor not true.&quot;</p>

<p>When science starts accepting this way of looking at their research, then we will start to understand consciousness and the nature of time as perceived by us.</p>
