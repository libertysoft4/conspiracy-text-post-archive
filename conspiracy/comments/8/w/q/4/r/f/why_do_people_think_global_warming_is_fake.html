    <div class="md"><p>I believe that scientists have absolutely zero clue about how much of an effect carbon emissions actually have on our climate, and therefore can’t possibly quantify any kind of “solution” to the problem.</p>

<p>Florida was supposed to be on water multiple times by now. I find it funny that when doomsday peddlers get the dates wrong and then push back their predictions for some BS reason, everyone laughs at them and discredits them the next time they make that claim.
than
Yet somehow when Al Gore and “climate scientists” are <em>completely</em> wrong multiple times, and just push back their predictions using BS explanations such as “The Pause” in order for their models to not be completely inaccurate, the entire MSM and much of the public somehow believes them now more than ever??</p>

<p>There’s more conclusive evidence for them having no clue what they are talking about than there is for carbon emissions causing catastrophic global consequences in the near future.</p>

<p>The Taurid meteor stream, solar flares, and super volcanos/massive tectonic events are far more of a threat to humanity than global warming, IMO.</p>

If you feel like you don&#39;t have that much time to spend for this, just watch WHY big oil...
In case you don&#39;t know The Corbett report/ James Corbett, he isn&#39;t some lunatic who reports every lie that fits his narative, but a real investigative journalist with an awesome reputation in the conspiracy theory world. Just saying this, because I know dolts here throw around 1.30 hour long youtube videos, made by lunatics who lie, fake and never deliver evidence/ sources and then those dolts act insulted when you don&#39;t watch all of it only to find out it was all garbage. :) Not the case here, promise.

    <div class="md"><p>i dont think you understand. say canada and us throw these carbon taxes on oil production. these oil companies (chinese companies own a good portion of the oil and oil companies in canada), who really really wants the oil , say you are making it too expensive to refine the bitumen on the continent, we are going to make a pipeline to the coast and refine it china or vietnam or wherever.</p>

<p>thats why the trans mountain  pipeline is being built, to ship raw bitumen to asia where it will be refined and then shipped back and resold. this carbon tax is really good excuse to avoid the more expensive labour and tighter environmental regulations in canada. its not going to be shipping refined product, its raw bitumen (the green party has been advocating building more refineries in alberta).  they then promote all this green energy to lower the price of oil (china is buying all the oil and oil companies it can, weather you think its on its way out or not)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maurice Strong: With all the evidence that we’ve amassed in our preparations for the Stockholm Conference, including the views of many of world’s leading scientists, I am convinced that the prophets of doom have got to be taken seriously. In other words, doomsday is a possibility. I am equally convinced that doomsday is not inevitable.”...  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YCatox0Lxo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YCatox0Lxo</a></p>

<p>....But perhaps the most remarkable thing about Strong, this ubiquitous figure of the 20th century environmental movement, was his background: a Rockefeller-connected millionaire from the Alberta oil patch who divided his time between environmental campaigning and running major oil companies.</p>

<p>To understand how this came about, we have to examine the history of the emergence of the environmental movement. In the post-war period, the desire to control the population put on a new mask: protecting the world from resource depletion, pollution and ecological catastrophe. And, as always, the Rockefeller family was there to provide the funding and organizational support to steer this burgeoning movement toward their own ends.</p>

<p>Joining the Rockefellers in shaping the international environmental movement were their fellow oiligarchs across the Atlantic, including the British royals behind BP and the Dutch Royals behind Royal Dutch Shell. And facilitating the transition from eugenics to population control to environmentalism was Julian Huxley, brother of Brave New World author Aldous Huxley and grandson of “Darwin’s bulldog” T.H. Huxley.</p>

<p>Julian Huxley was a committed eugenicist, chairing the British Eugenics Society from 1959 to 1962. But, like the other eugenicists of the post-war era, he understood the need to pursue the now-discredited work of eugenics under a different guise. The founding director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Huxley wrote in the agency’s founding document about the need to find ways to make the cause of eugenics politically viable once again:</p>

<p>“At the moment, it is probable that the indirect effect of civilisation is dysgenic instead of eugenic; and in any case it seems likely that the dead weight of genetic stupidity, physical weakness, mental instability, and disease-proneness, which already exist in the human species, will prove too great a burden for real progress to be achieved. Thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable.”</p>

<p><a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000681/068197eo.pdf">http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000681/068197eo.pdf</a></p>

<p>Huxley found the perfect front for the re-introduction of those “unthinkable” eugenical ideas in 1948, when he used UNESCO as a springboard for founding the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and then again in 1961, when he used that agency as a springboard to create the World Wildlife Fund. Joining Huxley as co-founders of the fund were not only Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, founder of the Bilderberg Group and former employee of the IG Farben conglomerate, and Prince Philip of England, but Godfrey A. Rockefeller of the Rockefeller dynasty. Together, they pledged to “harness public opinion and educate the world about the necessity for conservation.”</p>

<p>In 1987, Strong helped to organize another environmental conference, much less known but no less remarkable than the Stockholm summit. Dubbed the 4th World Wilderness Congress, the meeting took place in Denver, Colorado, and brought together Strong, David Rockefeller, Edmond de Rothschild, then-Treasury Secretary James Baker, and a gaggle of other oiligarchs, bankers, Washington power players and globalists, ostensibly to talk about the environment. What they actually discussed was altogether more incredible:</p>

<p>DAVID LANG: I suggest therefore that this be sold not through a democratic process. That would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder, unfortunately, that populates the earth. We have to take almost an elitist program, [so] that we can see beyond our swollen bellies, and look to the future in time frames and in results which are not easily understood, or which can be, with intellectual honesty, be reduced down to some kind of simplistic definition.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wild.org/wild-congress/4wwc/">https://www.wild.org/wild-congress/4wwc/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8c-NKjOOA0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8c-NKjOOA0</a></p>

<p>Those were the words of David Lang, a banker from Montreal who spoke during the conference. And to Lang, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds and the other bankers and oiligarchs assembled at the meeting, the general population are “cannon fodder” that “unfortunately […] populates the earth.” This candid admission, a perfect encapsulation of the eugenical ideas at the heart of the global conservation movement funded into existence by the oiligarchs themselves, was caught on tape by George Hunt, a businessman in Boulder, Colorado, who had volunteered to help the conference as a concerned citizen and came away horrified by what he had witnessed there. He released his own recordings of the proceedings in the early 1990s to warn the public about this group and its ultimate aims.</p>

<p>Hunt’s recording captured the moment when Maurice Strong introduced Baron Edmond de Rothschild — whose father’s cousin had sold the Rothschild’s Azerbaijani oil fields to Royal Dutch Shell in 1911 — as a pioneer of the environmental movement and a founder of the concept of “conservation banking.”</p>

<p>But there&#39;s NOT a conspiracy to deny climate change so that current billionaire oil/gas companies can continue to make the money they are making?</p>

<p>Is that correct? The currently poor entity is pushing the conspiracy and NOT the currently rich entity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This chart seems extremely fake (no scales, no margins of error, WAY too smooth, mentions a-historical events like the Hebrew Exodus...). I was curious, so I looked around and found <a href="http://www.longrangeweather.com/global_temperatures.htm">the source</a>. There, I found 0 discussion of methodology, which can be compared with <a href="https://www.climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au/en/climate-campus/global-climate-change/trends/">similar reconstruction of north hemisphere temperatures</a> which discuss in full the data used (ice cores, tree rings, sediments etc.) and the associated uncertainties. How do you reconcile these discrepancies?</p>

<p>Also, the &quot;about us&quot; page makes me suspect that at least Cliff Harris isn&#39;t a trained scientist, and just appropriated the &quot;climatologist&quot; tag to lend himself authority. His bio cites &quot;Since age 11, he has compiled nearly 100 weather scrapbooks that detail major events throughout the U.S. and the world on a daily basis&quot; as evidence of how smart he is, but no alma mater. And of course, his occupation is just to run a weather station and write for a local column...</p>

<p>Why? Marxists are by definition collectivist just like communists and Nazis were.  Why would I treat a collectivist like an individual?  Maybe so you can take advantage of our individual rights when it protects you and suits you then the antifa masks go on and you try to strip others of their individual rights when it&#39;s convenient and suits you as collectivist mobs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a ridiculous thing to be worried about, it&#39;s literally a thing trying to be pushed by the ipcc, the EU and all the 3 letter global government agencies IMF, CFR.  And yes this is exactly how sovereignty disappears. Any moron who has two brain cells to rub together can see that the US republic gave way to the US federation by creating new authorities above but outside of the existing republic that eventually devoured the sovereignty of the individual states, and that same moron might try observing the shit-show that is happening as EU member states are systematically having their sovereignty stripped away by what started as a &quot;free trade union&quot;.</p>

<p>You realize that people like me predicted the EU well over a decade before it appeared, we have been watching this club of Rome shit since the 70s which was where the EU was hatched.  You know what else was created by the club of Rome?  A global climate crisis!</p>

<p>I find this quite ironic, tbh. Yes, I&#39;ve looked at both sides, and I&#39;m not convinced, hence why I said what I&#39;ve said. How are you not understanding this?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re asking if I have a degree, then... no, I don&#39;t. I&#39;m self taught in many topics. Degrees are pointless, imo (ie. garbage in, garbage out - indoctrination).</p>

Small scale, individual acts of &quot;saving the planet&quot; don&#39;t matter when the larger economic system is designed to make things worse regardless.

<p>Pricing carbon would also lead directly to less food and energy being shipped to the third world.  The people who support pricing carbon generally also support subsidizing contraception in the third world, which would be the easiest way to calm your demographic fears.  Meanwhile, the groups that oppose pricing carbon also support heavy export-oriented agricultural subsidies, and oppose anything that seems like decent sex-ed or contraception for the third world.  Leaving aside that, however bad the third world&#39;s trash may seem anecdotally, the truth is that the vast majority of climate altering pollution comes from the first world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maurice Strong: With all the evidence that we’ve amassed in our preparations for the Stockholm Conference, including the views of many of world’s leading scientists, I am convinced that the prophets of doom have got to be taken seriously. In other words, doomsday is a possibility. I am equally convinced that doomsday is not inevitable.”...  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YCatox0Lxo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YCatox0Lxo</a></p>

<p>....But perhaps the most remarkable thing about Strong, this ubiquitous figure of the 20th century environmental movement, was his background: a Rockefeller-connected millionaire from the Alberta oil patch who divided his time between environmental campaigning and running major oil companies.</p>

<p>To understand how this came about, we have to examine the history of the emergence of the environmental movement. In the post-war period, the desire to control the population put on a new mask: protecting the world from resource depletion, pollution and ecological catastrophe. And, as always, the Rockefeller family was there to provide the funding and organizational support to steer this burgeoning movement toward their own ends.</p>

<p>Joining the Rockefellers in shaping the international environmental movement were their fellow oiligarchs across the Atlantic, including the British royals behind BP and the Dutch Royals behind Royal Dutch Shell. And facilitating the transition from eugenics to population control to environmentalism was Julian Huxley, brother of Brave New World author Aldous Huxley and grandson of “Darwin’s bulldog” T.H. Huxley.</p>

<p>Julian Huxley was a committed eugenicist, chairing the British Eugenics Society from 1959 to 1962. But, like the other eugenicists of the post-war era, he understood the need to pursue the now-discredited work of eugenics under a different guise. The founding director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Huxley wrote in the agency’s founding document about the need to find ways to make the cause of eugenics politically viable once again:</p>

<p>“At the moment, it is probable that the indirect effect of civilisation is dysgenic instead of eugenic; and in any case it seems likely that the dead weight of genetic stupidity, physical weakness, mental instability, and disease-proneness, which already exist in the human species, will prove too great a burden for real progress to be achieved. Thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable.”</p>

<p>Huxley found the perfect front for the re-introduction of those “unthinkable” eugenical ideas in 1948, when he used UNESCO as a springboard for founding the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and then again in 1961, when he used that agency as a springboard to create the World Wildlife Fund. Joining Huxley as co-founders of the fund were not only Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, founder of the Bilderberg Group and former employee of the IG Farben conglomerate, and Prince Philip of England, but Godfrey A. Rockefeller of the Rockefeller dynasty. Together, they pledged to “harness public opinion and educate the world about the necessity for conservation.”</p>

<p>In 1987, Strong helped to organize another environmental conference, much less known but no less remarkable than the Stockholm summit. Dubbed the 4th World Wilderness Congress, the meeting took place in Denver, Colorado, and brought together Strong, David Rockefeller, Edmond de Rothschild, then-Treasury Secretary James Baker, and a gaggle of other oiligarchs, bankers, Washington power players and globalists, ostensibly to talk about the environment. What they actually discussed was altogether more incredible:</p>

<p>DAVID LANG: I suggest therefore that this be sold not through a democratic process. That would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder, unfortunately, that populates the earth. We have to take almost an elitist program, [so] that we can see beyond our swollen bellies, and look to the future in time frames and in results which are not easily understood, or which can be, with intellectual honesty, be reduced down to some kind of simplistic definition.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wild.org/wild-congress/4wwc/">https://www.wild.org/wild-congress/4wwc/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8c-NKjOOA0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8c-NKjOOA0</a></p>

<p>Those were the words of David Lang, a banker from Montreal who spoke during the conference. And to Lang, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds and the other bankers and oiligarchs assembled at the meeting, the general population are “cannon fodder” that “unfortunately […] populates the earth.” This candid admission, a perfect encapsulation of the eugenical ideas at the heart of the global conservation movement funded into existence by the oiligarchs themselves, was caught on tape by George Hunt, a businessman in Boulder, Colorado, who had volunteered to help the conference as a concerned citizen and came away horrified by what he had witnessed there. He released his own recordings of the proceedings in the early 1990s to warn the public about this group and its ultimate aims.</p>

<p>Hunt’s recording captured the moment when Maurice Strong introduced Baron Edmond de Rothschild — whose father’s cousin had sold the Rothschild’s Azerbaijani oil fields to Royal Dutch Shell in 1911 — as a pioneer of the environmental movement and a founder of the concept of “conservation banking.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one thinks the Paris Agreement actually solves anything.  The Kyoto Protocol, which was very different, might have solved it, but only because at that early date the problem was much smaller.  Carbon credits are not taxes on nations that use carbon, the Paris Agreement does not mandate specific mechanisms for national emission reductions, there&#39;s plenty of ways to reduce carbon usage without tax revenues going beyond the local level, or even without taxes on carbon at all.</p>

<p>Lastly, because this is a problem that will disproportionately affect nations and communities that have not historically and do not currently have high emissions, any moral system more evolved than &quot;fuck you got mine&quot; should be able to accept that there should be significant economic transfer for rich to poor in addressing this issue.  Moreover, since ethics in economics isn&#39;t something y&#39;all tend to support, even someone with a basic understanding of science or geopolitics should understand why some rich-poor economic transfer is required for rich nations and demographics to achieve their own optimal result.</p>

<p>This is enhanced by the fact that older people wield more political and economic power than younger people.  Why care if the ice cap will melt by 2050 if you&#39;re going to die by 2040?  Moreover, for the older generation to acknowledge global warming as a problem would require them to acknowledge that their lifestyle choices contributed significantly to it.

    <div class="md"><p>Maurice Strong: With all the evidence that we’ve amassed in our preparations for the Stockholm Conference, including the views of many of world’s leading scientists, I am convinced that the prophets of doom have got to be taken seriously. In other words, doomsday is a possibility. I am equally convinced that doomsday is not inevitable.”...  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YCatox0Lxo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YCatox0Lxo</a></p>

<p>....But perhaps the most remarkable thing about Strong, this ubiquitous figure of the 20th century environmental movement, was his background: a Rockefeller-connected millionaire from the Alberta oil patch who divided his time between environmental campaigning and running major oil companies.</p>

<p>To understand how this came about, we have to examine the history of the emergence of the environmental movement. In the post-war period, the desire to control the population put on a new mask: protecting the world from resource depletion, pollution and ecological catastrophe. And, as always, the Rockefeller family was there to provide the funding and organizational support to steer this burgeoning movement toward their own ends.</p>

<p>Joining the Rockefellers in shaping the international environmental movement were their fellow oiligarchs across the Atlantic, including the British royals behind BP and the Dutch Royals behind Royal Dutch Shell. And facilitating the transition from eugenics to population control to environmentalism was Julian Huxley, brother of Brave New World author Aldous Huxley and grandson of “Darwin’s bulldog” T.H. Huxley.</p>

<p>Julian Huxley was a committed eugenicist, chairing the British Eugenics Society from 1959 to 1962. But, like the other eugenicists of the post-war era, he understood the need to pursue the now-discredited work of eugenics under a different guise. The founding director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Huxley wrote in the agency’s founding document about the need to find ways to make the cause of eugenics politically viable once again:</p>

<p>“At the moment, it is probable that the indirect effect of civilisation is dysgenic instead of eugenic; and in any case it seems likely that the dead weight of genetic stupidity, physical weakness, mental instability, and disease-proneness, which already exist in the human species, will prove too great a burden for real progress to be achieved. Thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable.”</p>

<p><a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000681/068197eo.pdf">http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000681/068197eo.pdf</a></p>

<p>Huxley found the perfect front for the re-introduction of those “unthinkable” eugenical ideas in 1948, when he used UNESCO as a springboard for founding the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and then again in 1961, when he used that agency as a springboard to create the World Wildlife Fund. Joining Huxley as co-founders of the fund were not only Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, founder of the Bilderberg Group and former employee of the IG Farben conglomerate, and Prince Philip of England, but Godfrey A. Rockefeller of the Rockefeller dynasty. Together, they pledged to “harness public opinion and educate the world about the necessity for conservation.”</p>

<p>In 1987, Strong helped to organize another environmental conference, much less known but no less remarkable than the Stockholm summit. Dubbed the 4th World Wilderness Congress, the meeting took place in Denver, Colorado, and brought together Strong, David Rockefeller, Edmond de Rothschild, then-Treasury Secretary James Baker, and a gaggle of other oiligarchs, bankers, Washington power players and globalists, ostensibly to talk about the environment. What they actually discussed was altogether more incredible:</p>

<p>DAVID LANG: I suggest therefore that this be sold not through a democratic process. That would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder, unfortunately, that populates the earth. We have to take almost an elitist program, [so] that we can see beyond our swollen bellies, and look to the future in time frames and in results which are not easily understood, or which can be, with intellectual honesty, be reduced down to some kind of simplistic definition.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8c-NKjOOA0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8c-NKjOOA0</a></p>

<p>Those were the words of David Lang, a banker from Montreal who spoke during the conference. And to Lang, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds and the other bankers and oiligarchs assembled at the meeting, the general population are “cannon fodder” that “unfortunately […] populates the earth.” This candid admission, a perfect encapsulation of the eugenical ideas at the heart of the global conservation movement funded into existence by the oiligarchs themselves, was caught on tape by George Hunt, a businessman in Boulder, Colorado, who had volunteered to help the conference as a concerned citizen and came away horrified by what he had witnessed there. He released his own recordings of the proceedings in the early 1990s to warn the public about this group and its ultimate aims.</p>

<p>Hunt’s recording captured the moment when Maurice Strong introduced Baron Edmond de Rothschild — whose father’s cousin had sold the Rothschild’s Azerbaijani oil fields to Royal Dutch Shell in 1911 — as a pioneer of the environmental movement and a founder of the concept of “conservation banking.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best argument against man-made global warming is that rapid climate change is being seen on planets and moons throughout our solar system that is further than can be explained by normal seasonal weather changes.  If changes are happening all over the solar system, than it is logical that whatever is driving their changes is also a strong contributor to the changes on Earth.  I would recommend David Wilcock&#39;s Wisdom Teachings series on Gaia.com as the best explanation of that theory (Season 28).  It is well worth the monthly subscription to gaia to become well versed on the topic.</p>

Pollution is bad for the Earth, but climate change is a load of crap and a way for corrupt politicians to steal more money from us. </p>

<p>Also do I mix this with anything resulting from pollution or environmental damage. I am very much against both of those.</p>

<p>No Climate Denier means I do not feel there has been sufficient proof to:</p>

<p>1.Show that human produced CO2 is the &#39;knob&#39; that controls the planet&#39;s temperature.</p>

<p>2.Show that if the planet were to warm a bit (notice how this is different from number 1) that is a bad thing.</p>

<h1>If Man Made Climate Change is Such a Slam Dunk, Why Do They Keep Faking Data?</h1>

<p>In  science you never change the data, but in Global Warming / Climate  Change, they keep &#39;adjusting&#39; past data. Why lower the temps from 70+  years ago to make the past look colder &amp; make the present look  warmer? Maybe because your global warming models don&#39;t work unless you  cheat?</p>

<p>Here are some examples. There are many more.</p>

<p>Switzerland’s weather bureau adjusted its raw temperature data so that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522010938/http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2015/05/18/temperature-fibbers-being-investigated">“the temperatures reported were consistently higher than those actually recorded.”</a></p>

<p>Paul Homewood documented how NASA has “homogenized” temperature data across Paraguay <a href="https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/all-of-paraguays-temperature-record-has-been-tampered-with/#more-12774">to create a warming trend that doesn’t exist in the raw data.</a></p>

<p>The  Australian Bureau of Meteorology admits it adjusts temperatures  resulting in higher temperatures for the present and lower numbers for  the past--<strong>showing a historical warming trend</strong>--that didn&#39;t exist. <a href="https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/australian-meteorologists-caught-fudging-numbers">The  difference between actually measured temperatures and homogenized  temperatures topped 4 degrees Celsius over certain periods at some  measuring stations.</a></p>

<p><strong>“Almost  all the alterations resulted in higher temperatures being reported for  the present and lower numbers for the past–with the higher numbers being  used to demonstrate a historical warming trend–than the numbers that  were actually recorded,”</strong></p>

<p>Florida was supposed to be on water multiple times by now. I find it funny that when doomsday peddlers get the dates wrong and then push back their predictions for some BS reason, everyone laughs at them and discredits them the next time they make that claim.
than
Yet somehow when Al Gore and “climate scientists” are <em>completely</em> wrong multiple times, and just push back their predictions using BS explanations such as “The Pause” in order for their models to not be completely inaccurate, the entire MSM and much of the public somehow believes them now more than ever??</p>

<p>There’s more conclusive evidence for them having no clue what they are talking about than there is for carbon emissions causing catastrophic global consequences in the near future.</p>

<p>The Taurid meteor stream, solar flares, and super volcanos/massive tectonic events are far more of a threat to humanity than global warming, IMO.</p>
