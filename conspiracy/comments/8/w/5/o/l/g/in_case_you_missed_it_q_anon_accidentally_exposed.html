<p>Unfortunately for Q, it took the power of autism less than 5 minutes to find <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NvyCqgrzOYc/maxresdefault.jpg">the source image used to create this</a>, which was originally taken in 2015.</p>

<p>To be clear: the &quot;reflection&quot; in the iPhone is <strong>identical</strong> to this image when you <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pZTqwgz.jpg">account for perspective</a>.</p>

<p>In a sudden, uncharacteristic twist, Q jumped to defend himself by <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bXSiisy.png">suggesting it was just an epic troll</a>.</p>

<p>And, as you may have guessed, many of his blind followers jumped through the mental hoops required to believe him.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been following Q since the first few drops. I hung on in there after seeing so little materialize, and something always being just around the corner...</p>

<p>... But this is just blatant lying and manipulation.</p>

<p>What about those of us never convinced by Q? Are we super geniuses?</p>

<p>There are 2 conclusions here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Either Q is a LARP put together by an autist</p></li>
<li><p>Q is a purposeful disinformation campaign by the Deep State. You think a state entity wouldn&#39;t have the resources to reverse engineer an image board tripcode? Give me a break.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro i&#39;m on shrooms and your comment made me mad, bro i never get mad when i&#39;m on shrooms like fuck you!!!!! so here&#39;s a long winded response that took wayyyyy to long to write.
I&#39;m not going to address the q stuff you said one way or another, but I will challenge you on the sentiment of your last statement.
again fuck you bro. </p>

<p>** &quot;Anyone getting their &quot;truth&quot; (or any information) from 4chan needs to open their eyes.&quot; -u/freshwordsalad**</p>

<p>this attitude is 100% contrary, to what I believe, anyone earnest in their pursuit of knowledge(or dissemination of it) within the truther/conspiracy/disclosure community would espouse. 
In my opinion truth should be discerned on a claim by claim basis, while keeping in mind the circumstance surrounding the way it is being made (e.g its on reddit, e.g its on cnn, e.g its from a friend serving in Syria). </p>

<p>I am always cautious of statements being, impied or otherwise, that tell you to avoid platforms of generally open discourse where truth claims are being made. </p>

<p>his statement: <strong>Anyone getting their &quot;truth&quot; (or any information) from 4chan needs to open their eyes.</strong>   should worry you because analyzing a truth claim form 4chan, is the same as analyzing a truth claim from youtube. (if your doing it right) and if he would have said <strong>anyone getting their &quot;truth&quot;(or any information) from youtube needs to open their eyes</strong>   although it has Has a very different feel to it the meaning is essentially the same. </p>

<p>again fuck you guy, why the fuck are you on the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subreddit telling people not to analyze information from simillar forums. <strong>It makes no fucking sense</strong>, and you killed my shroomy vibe you fucking shit eating ass sucking piece of filth.</p>

Others are still making maps of the system to expose the inner workings, or digging into the Clinton foundation, or exposing the child crimes that the MSM has been hiding for…ever. Pass by the looky lou&#39;s and stick with the caring, curious diggers. There are gems out there. Even the bad apples have a purpose. They expose the ignorance or hate/fear that&#39;s out there.

How do you stop leaks from insiders? Or at least others from listening to them? You have the master insider. The one Q to bind them all. So if another legit insider comes along, Q can claim their illegitimacy and they are never believed again. So it doesn&#39;t matter what Q says as long as it crowds out real leakers.</p>

Trump and his cabinet are off limits since they are the good guys, and his lack of action against the deep state is just waved away as &quot;part of the plan.&quot; The whole movement is controlled opposition designed to limit who is trusted and who is questioned. </p>

<p>I understand your point of view, but I don&#39;t agree with it.  The cat is out of the bag with the Satanic pedophiles.  You think that people will let this continue, but I believe we absolutely cannot let it continue.  </p>

<p>How can we explain to future generations that we learned the world is ruled by Satanic pedophiles, but we did not stop it?  We tolerated it, so future generations also have to deal with it.  </p>

I remember the first post.  I ignored it because I did not realize its significance.  LOL.  </p>

<p>People turned up the Epstein connection really fast, and I thought that Trump would be implicated pretty quick.  It fizzled out before the election.  I think that if they had Trump on video screwing kids, then he would not have won the election and he certainly would not be able to fight the Cabal.  </p>

<p>If Q is a larp, then it is a white hat larp to wake people up.  </p>

<p>I stopped trusting everyone that I do not know.  I mean, how can we possibly know what these people do behind closed doors.  Tom Hanks is implicated in pizzagate.  There are no more heroes!  </p>

<p>I do not doubt that Trump was targeted in a pedo honey pot, but apparently they did not get him.  </p>

<p>&quot;It just looks too much like brainwashing and blind loyalty to me.&quot;  Not really.  We are making due with what we have.  Trump can do good and help destroy the Cabal, or Trump can sell his soul to them.  Either way, we need to do something about the Cabal before it is too late.  You can certainly agree with that, right?  I mean, you are not for the Cabal are you?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I&#39;m pissed about this. Additionally, this information was supressed on 8ch as well as on <a href="/r/greatawakening">/r/greatawakening</a>, which is extremely suspicious.</p>

<p>What confused me is that you have instances of actual coordination with POTUS, eg: <a href="https://i.redditmedia.com/BXWuOgC8Um2ij_NGD2G_3W93QZSq1KATq7LXpqvmVRk.png?w=1024&amp;amp;s=3d3eb0ca5e68f41196ee1ae996ab2969">https://i.redditmedia.com/BXWuOgC8Um2ij_NGD2G_3W93QZSq1KATq7LXpqvmVRk.png?w=1024&amp;amp;s=3d3eb0ca5e68f41196ee1ae996ab2969</a>
plus many, many more IMO.</p>

<p>Maybe Q is black propaganda, run by a psyop company contracted by Trump? It sort of makes sense-- Q will have a substantial impact on the November elections. So many people already following Q are in denial about this obvious lying and manipulation here. Q will retain a following as long as he doesn&#39;t make a string of similar mistakes running up to the midterms, and conveniently, the hyped date 11-11-18 is AFTER the midterms. Even if every single subsequent Q post is disprovable like this, I think he STILL would retain a following. Humans are sheep by nature, and the Q movement is no longer a majority of truthers, rather, it is a majority of GOP sheep.</p>

<p>The thing is, Q&#39;s not a simple LARP, there are a lot of actually legit proofs/coordinations between Q and Trump. Q&#39;s tone also changed starting in June.</p>

<p>Based on last night, I&#39;m leaning towards Q being black propaganda. But the whole thing is very confusing. I laid out my midterm election theory in the above comment. That&#39;s my best guess so far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only people who support Q in a cult-like fashion are Trump supporters who probably don&#39;t even know that 9/11 was an inside job. GOP sheep.</p>

<p>There are actually many many rational truthers who follow Q. Additionally, there are many actual proofs of coordination of Q with POTUS. Otherwise, rational people wouldn&#39;t be able to stomach being in this movement. There are actually lots rational, skeptical people who believe(d) Q.</p>

<p>If you go to Q&#39;s board on 8chan there is essentially a mutiny happening right now because of the recent Q fuckup.</p>

<p>Q is either:</p>

<p>A) The real deal</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>B) Some sort of Trump/Military Intelligence/deepstate psyop.</p>

<p>And since Q has to be deceptive about his physical proximity to POTUS, option A is extremely unlikely. The recent fuckup and double-down all but confirmed option B to be what&#39;s really happening. The weird thing is that the Q movement is opposed by just about every other community in the mainstream. Even Zionist Infowars tried to derail it. Still, maybe all that is just controlled oppostion and the deep state is playing 4d chess, and Trump is actually just controlled opposition. Based on the MSM hate of Trump, it really doesn&#39;t seem that way, though.</p>

<p>Regardless, to dismiss Q as a simple LARP is dangerous IMO.  </p>

<p>IMO this is not true. As someone who was/is part of the Qmmunity, I think Q has converted many disillusioned independents to Trump. The narrative Q paints is far more consistent than either the left or right wing MSM narratives.</p>

<p>As more and more get redpilled to false flag such as 9/11 and Sandy Hook type hoaxes, catching them into the Q anon net will make them Trump supporters. Q&#39;s narrative and goals are relatively consistent with a truther&#39;s.</p>

<p>Also, Q is hope porn in a bleak world. Those who are redpilled know we have no shot at taking down the cabal. But Q says we do! So it is a very attractive prospect. Our culture is undergoing a revolution right now... SOO many people are waking up to the obvious lies of the cabal thanks to the internet. Maybe Q is there to contain/filter it.</p>

<p>The thing is, this recent fuckup by Q is so amateurish. Idk. Good or bad, Q is definitely a super important cultural force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The spaces aren&#39;t consistent btw. If you copy the whole tweet, you have 60 spaces (and remove the non-boxed stuff obviously). The two additional spaces come from a second being added after NRA and the &quot;and&quot; in the final sentence. </p>

<p>If you copy just the boxed stuff, you have 58. </p>

<p>If you look at Twitter&#39;s raw text of just the boxed stuff, in the &lt;p&gt; field of the tweet, you have way less because it removes extra spaces before &quot;MAKE.&quot; Twitter messes with the raw input you give it. So, reliably trying to coordinate the kind of messages you&#39;re talking about isn&#39;t smart because there are different ways Twitter formats the output.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see the extra spaces after &quot;NRA&quot; and &quot;and&quot; that you&#39;re talking about. Are they in the raw input?</p>

<p>I understand your line of reasoning regarding twitter fucking with your raw input. However... I copy pasted Trump&#39;s tweet and tweeted it myself, and then copypasted my tweet below:</p>

<p>The actual text in the &lt;p&gt; field has absolutely no extra spaces. Here&#39;s a photo but you can check yourself by highlighting it and using your Chrome or Firefox built-in web development tools. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6y8KpeS.jpg">Photo</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s weird you&#39;re not getting the same issue. It might be the browser&#39;s messing with it then. I&#39;m using Firefox. I&#39;m getting the extra spaces by highlighting the WHOLE tweet, starting at the &quot;!&quot; at the end, and then going up to the &quot;W&quot; at the beginning. Then pasting it into Twitter&#39;s tweet box thing for my own account. Here&#39;s a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/FuPM4F4">photo</a>.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m thinking it might be a Firefox thing. I just tried copying it with IE (don&#39;t have Chrome) and it was copying without the the spaces. I wish I could figure out where Twitter is storing the formatting data (e.g. where are the extra spaces before &quot;MAKE&quot; coming from). Perhaps we can find an instance of a double space in an actual Trump tweet, which might not be that hard with the Twitter API and a python script but I&#39;m too busy today to work on it. That&#39;d blow the lid off what I&#39;m saying. As for why yours Tweets with the spaces, you could just chalk it up to follower disparity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, ultimately, I don&#39;t think Trump&#39;s tweet having 58 spaces is meaningful in the first place. But, even if it did, the web technologies involved aren&#39;t consistent enough for that to be a meaningful way to encode messages or &quot;collaborations&quot; like OP claimed was being done. You have the whole layer of formatting on the website end (which you just dealt with in the Reddit comment itself even), the inspection of the code creating the Tweet reveals that Twitter doesn&#39;t just post your raw text (otherwise we would see the collection of spaces before &quot;MAKE&quot; in the code), and finally you have the software layer that is the web browser providing the way you interact with this stuff, which you and I have discovered isn&#39;t consistent itself (IE, and you presumably using Chrome/Opera or a different version of FF than my own, having different formatting). I also tested on two different OS environments (Windows 10 and a linux distro. called GalliumOS). But those could conceivably muck with the formatting as well!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its an interesting question! Live action. Role playing.</p>

<p>Sounds like another way of saying &quot;Job&quot;. We all step in and out of different &quot;roles&quot;.</p>

<p>Sounds like every high paying job in society.</p>

<p>Solicitors. Lawyers. Politicians.</p>

<p>Newscasters. Actors. Sports-stars. Youtubers. Presidents.</p>

<p>These &quot;roles&quot; have been taught to them by others. When a human becomes any of the above, are they acting as themselves? Or are they assuming a prescribed role? Everybody LARPs. Being a father/mother is a LARP.</p>

<p>I have no problem with LARPing because almost EVERYTHING could be considered LARP. In the context of Q, I&#39;m more concerned about the content of the messages sent, and the any intent or purpose behind them.</p>

<p>In reference to OP, AFAIK Q has not claimed the image to be an unedited photo and has explicitly declared that they will troll and seed disinfo. Q is most ceirtainly a psy-op, but who is the target? Would someone decieving the public encourage the public to investigate for themselves and use critical thinking? Would someone afraid of disclosure set the masses on the path to discovery?</p>

<p>I sure as hell know that the MSM discourages the public from engaging in such activities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Attaching Trump to any kind of good cause gave it away for me immediately. I know exactly what that man is. An empty vessel used for sucking up all the narcissistic supply around him he can find to fuel his grandiose false self image. No ultimate good could ever come from that pursuit.</p>

<p>The fact that people have to resort to believing that Trump&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m an idiot who pretends to know everything and I never plan for anything at all&quot; personality is really just all an act and he&#39;s using it to really conceal his genius so he can work undetected behind the scenes just shows you how absolutely delusional these people are to being with.</p>

<p>They&#39;re narcissists who can&#39;t mentally handle the fact that the guy they saw as themselves (Trump) is really actually a childish, immoral, incompetent moron. They can see it because they can&#39;t see it about him because they can&#39;t see it about themselves. They cannot face who they truly are. It&#39;s too painful. So they project all of their negative feelings about themselves and their negative attributes onto outside groups or people seen as their enemies. That&#39;s why they&#39;re so obsessed with Obama and the Clintons yet barely say anything about Republicans. Everything is black and white in their world. They see themselves as America and everything America should represent. Republican, Conservative, Christian, White. This is their identity and they ascribe everything that is good to this identity. It&#39;s just a facade though, a mask to hide their true selves. The ugly hate they have inside that would reveal their hypocrisy (Trump is the manifestation of that).</p>

<p>So they project that they are Christians when they are probably devoid of both love and truth. They claim to be for law and order yet probably break several laws themselves. They claim to be patriotic and for the Constitution yet they don&#39;t have a problem trampling on other groups Constitutional rights. They claim to be of high moral standing yet they care little for the poor and are the party that racists cling to. What they truly care about, is their dominance in the social hierarchy that they feel belongs to them simply because they are White, Christian and Conservative. They feel this gives them the authority of being a REAL American. This is where they get their perceived superiority from. These are things they did not accomplish themselves and only got through accident of birth, therefore they cannot be taken away from them. That is, unless they were to become a minority and lose control.</p>

<p>In order to trick their minds into getting rid of all that ugliness deep inside them, they project all of their inner ugliness and negative feelings onto outside groups and people. These are groups that threaten their identity and their social hierarchy status. This is because if they were to lose that status, all they would be left with is themselves. No one to look down on you can blame all your problems on and think you&#39;re better than. You&#39;d have to face the very real fact that you are the source of your problems and you are very ugly and empty on the inside. This is too painful for them to bear so they&#39;ll do whatever they can to avoid this realization. The groups that are threatening to this perceived loss of status are liberals, black people, Muslims, and illegal immigrants. Any ground conceded to these groups are seen as a threat. So since they see themselves as America and these people are a threat to their &quot;top of the hierarchy&quot; identities, they perceive these groups as a threat to America itself.</p>

<p>Trump is the literal manifestation of their primal fears of losing their social status come to life like a caged animal backed into a corner lashing out. He is the embodiment of their entire belief system. He is everything they are and everything they wish they could be. Which says a lot about them and is why he is exposing all of them. He is their shadow self they have been hiding for so long while they pretend to be moral and care about rules and laws.</p>

<p>Once his complete incompetence and idiocy started coming to light. They also couldn&#39;t mentally handle it because of what it would mean about themselves. In comes Q the rescue and gave them the fantasy world they&#39;ve been waiting for their whole lives. Obama and the Clinton&#39;s really are as evil as I thought! They&#39;re running the whole thing! They&#39;re Satan reincarnate!!! Q appeals to their narcissistic need to be both a victim and a misunderstood genius. So they  latch on to a conspiracy theory that allows them to explain all of Trump&#39;s ineptitude away. He&#39;s really just a secret genius! This is perfect because these people see themselves as misunderstood secret geniuses too.</p>

<p>Watching this from the outside is so obvious to me because my father is one of these Fox News watching, conspiratorial, end times obsessed, Christian conservatives who has ALWAYS latched onto these gurus who tell him when the next big thing is going to happen that never happens. Yet there he goes, onto the next one like nothing. You know the ones I&#39;m talking about. The modern typical Trump supporter who thought Reagan was Jesus Christ himself. The ones who are actually giant double standard having hypocrites who hate Obama and criticized everything about him who won&#39;t say a bad thing about Trump. This entire Trump thing has been orchestrated to appeal to these people. Literally EVERYTHING. That&#39;show they got them so psychologically hooked onto him where he can do literally anything and they go along with it. This has been a mass hypnosis project being played on them for I don&#39;t know how long but it&#39;s so fucking evil and genius that I can&#39;t help but sit back and almost be in awe of it. The combining of the Republicans and Christianity in the 80s was a MAJOR part in all of this deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I do have some narcissistic traits due to the abuse in my childhood. The difference is, I have faced the ugliness inside of me and acknowledged it. When you do that, when you really face your own evil that&#39;s inside you, you can see it clearly in others. I can spot lies, abuse tactics and narcissists very easily because of this. I suppress my own capacity for this behavior (as best as I can) but I still know how these people think and what they do. Think of me like Dexter. Since I have this insight and I have no desire to act upon my ugly parts, I react to them by trying to educate others about people who do act upon these desires in an effort to harm others. You can call it projection but projection is subconscious and mostly not accurate. Like when Trump ascribed The Snake poem to illegal immigrants. &quot;You knew I was a snake before you let me in!&quot;. He&#39;s really talking about himself and he has no clue. Have a nice day. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the psychology behind Trump himself to better help you understand him. I&#39;ll break into some specific topics a little deeper like projection and the differrent ways he&#39;s being manipulated and controlled. I wrote this about a month or 2 ago I think.</p>

<p>First, to understand Trump, you need to understand that he is the very definition of an overt malignant Narcissist. Meaning he is sociopathic and he is purely ego driven. Everything he does is in pursuit of seeing his grandiose false-self reflected back to him. This includes lying, manipulating and deceiving anyone and everyone to achieve this. Narcissists can only see themselves in the reflection of the way other&#39;s treat them. Treat Trump like he is anything less than amazing, he lashes out at you because it doesn&#39;t align with his grandiose false-self. He suffers what is called a &quot;Narcissistic injury&quot; from the perceived insult and it induces what is called &quot;Narcissistic rage&quot;. The narcissistic injury hurts the inner true self, who was wounded a long time ago in childhood and to protect itself, it created the grandiose false-self as a barrier of protection. In doing that, it ensured that the inner self never healed or matured. That&#39;s why the lashing out is in the vein of a young child throwing a temper tantrum. Even Trump himself said his temperament is the same as it was when he was in the 1st grade. The narcissist never emotionally matured past the age that the false-self was created. So for this reason, the only true thing a Narcissist cares about, is their image. The way other&#39;s see them and treat them needs to align with this false-self so they can protect their inner true-self from more wounding. This image can be propped up by complete lies as long as the image holds. The narcissist doesn&#39;t care either way, they just do whatever is necessary to make sure the image doesn&#39;t crumble. They have various methods for maintaining the false image. All of them are abusive. Gaslighting, projection, triangulation, over exaggerations, moving the goal posts, threats, smear campaigns. Here is a link to help you learn about these tactics.</p>

<p>Once you truly understand and accept this about Trump, you will understand how dangerous he is to our country and to the world. Since he is driven by ego, he is easily manipulated. Flattery is one simple way to get him on your side. Simply speak well about him and he likes you, he even says so himself. There was a story recently about the odd feedback loop between Fox News and Trump and how it sort of got started. Trump would watch CNN and be fuming all the time about their coverage at his staff. They tried to direct him to watch Fox instead but knew they couldn&#39;t directly tell him that because he wouldn&#39;t listen. They had to make him think it was his own idea. From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the hope of calming him down, then–chief of staff Reince Priebus and then–press secretary Sean Spicer began a subtle campaign. “It got to the point that they were just like, ‘We need to get him off these channels and onto Fox &amp; Friends or else we’re going to be chasing down this crazy-train bullshit from MSNBC and CNN all day,’ ” one former White House official said.Like all other ideas, this had the highest chance of implementation if Trump believed he’d thought of it on his own. Priebus and Spicer worked talking points about the network’s high ratings and importance to his base of supporters into conversation until, eventually, it stuck, so that the president’s television consumption is today what the current White House official called “mainly a complete dosage of Fox.” The former official added, “Trump’s someone who loves praise more than he likes hate-watching Morning Joe.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is completely in line with how a Narcissist like Trump works. The scary part is, if Trump can be manipulated like this into changing his television habits because of the slights to his ego, do we really think other world leaders are not aware of his vulnerability to these kinds of manipulations? Something to seriously consider and worry about.</p>

<p>Gathering what I know about Trump and his life (I&#39;ve watched several documentaries about him and read a lot too), at the very least, he had a very critical father and an emotionally absent mother. He was never shown what can be considered love unless it was attached to some sort of achievement. This is what drives him to the next big challenge and since he never got the proper love and approval from his parents, he seeks it from the outside world. The campaign rallies were his life blood, the air he breathed, what is called &quot;Narcissistic supply&quot;. Those rallies and people chanting things at him might as well been a shot of heroin straight to his veins. He would literally say anything to get that reaction. You can see his amazement of the crowd when talks about when he first brought up the birther thing with Obama at a conservative speaking event and when he talks about how the Drain the Swamp chant got started, which he basically admits he didn&#39;t even mean in the first place. The &quot;Lock Her Up&quot; chant was also just for show, as he admits in this video too. Trevor Noah is pretty awful but his commentary on the Trump clips is pretty spot on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/i9tog6/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-trump-lets-the-truth-come-out-post-election">http://www.cc.com/video-clips/i9tog6/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-trump-lets-the-truth-come-out-post-election</a></p>

<p>What he says about &quot;Truth Trump&quot; is completely true. Narcissists always reveal themselves eventually because they are too proud not to boast about their deceptions. They do it in little ways you can miss if you&#39;re blinded by their grandiosity. Here&#39;s a little moment where he straight up admits he lies to his supporters.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho8WOL_kB4o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho8WOL_kB4o</a></p>

<p>Narcissists are also walking talking projection machines. Which you can learn about in the first link I provided about abuse tactics. Everything Trump accuses someone else of doing, it&#39;s because he is doing it himself. Everything negative Trump says about someone else, it&#39;s really how he feels about himself. Take a look at Trump&#39;s tweets about Obama during his presidency, they are practically predicting the future of his own actions as president. When you put it into context, some of them are quite frightening. Here are a few:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll post this list underneath this post because it&#39;s too long</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you may not directly see the projection in all of these (I can explain them for you) but you definitely see them in his complaints about Syria and Obama&#39;s golfing. Apply this to the press conference he had will all of Bill Clinton&#39;s accuser&#39;s after the pussy tape got revealed, see a pattern here? Also, the more upset, angry and loudly proclaimed a narcissists denial of an accusation made against them, the more likely it is to be true.</p>

<p>Narcissists actually hate themselves. The common misconception is that they are in love with themselves. They aren&#39;t. They are in love with the REFLECTION of their grandiose false-self. Without that reflection looking back at them, they sink into a deep dark depression. They will also fight to the death to maintain their image. A malignant narcissist like Trump, his inner true self is so decayed, he is literally nothing BUT the image. If the image dies, he dies. There is no other side to Trump. No soft sensitive side his family sees, no compassion or empathy for anyone unless that person can directly benefit him. Trump talks a lot about loyalty, but who has he stuck his neck out for? As soon as someone is a liability to him, he throws them under the bus the first chance he gets. He is only loyal insomuch that you can either help him or hurt him. Trump does not care about me or anyone else unless they can benefit him. He cared about the American people when they were chanting and voting for him but as soon as he doesn&#39;t need you for narcissistic supply, he&#39;ll throw you overboard the first chance he gets. Then he&#39;ll lie and gaslight everyone into thinking he really didn&#39;t. Just look at this recent deal with China and his helping out of ZTE, right on the heels of the news that China invested $500 million into his business ventures in India. You think that&#39;s a coincidence? The man has been personally benefiting since the campaign in all sorts of ways. The Cohen revelations are just the tip of the iceberg here.</p>

It&#39;s pretty hard to crack (although definitely not impossible), but every Q post has the same tripcode, so it&#39;s probably the same person/group of people. Although he&#39;s still totally full of shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So thanks man, for taking the tome and effort to go out, read up on, and come up with such a difinitive answer that should wake so many people up!</p>

<p>Yes I am bring sarcastic. There is so much data in posts, complicated sources, disinformation, obvious media bias and these Q posts have NOT once, been discredited or disavowed by the Administration. No attacks, or anything from any reporter that asks if there is any relationship to Q or variation. Not one.</p>

<p>It would ne EASY for someone in the administation to flatly make a statement to disavow. It would be easy for someone in the press to badger a statement out from any press briefing frim Sanders or whomever. They have badgered about way less critical issues. Weird.</p>

<p>I’m guessing, but from the tone I’m pretty sure I’m guessing correctly. you psted from this from an obvious non-suppoter position, which is fine. I am just not understanding that you would put so much effort into something with the length of posts, soooo many things to try and coordinate, sifting through all the disinfo from Alex Jones types, and in the face of seemingly either the greatest larper ever, or actual list of ties supporting it, you feel so confident in your conclusion? </p>

<p>It totally leaves me with the conlusion you are adding to the ‘turrfing going on, have bias to make such end-of-line claims in a couple paragraphs.  I say the same thing in every thread like this. No one is recruiting actively for Q, or going to subs brigading and using sliding tactics. Simply people discussing in their own subs, using their minds and discussion with others.  Why do you care so much then? Have your laugh and move on.</p>

<p>It is weird that these larp posts come in on the regular for something that is such an obvious larp to those that spent all that time an effort for the long list of ties. Add in the no smoking gun posts, ddos attacks and dis-information spread about Q (like alex jones). Tthe ‘chans’ are not going to take followers that have TDS, the message boards are full of pretty nasty fetishs, porn, and the sewer of the internet, lol. </p>

<p>Why take the time to write this out, are people that afraid of the Q message? If not, and it is all a larp, am I to beleive that you are just thingking to help with your virtuous meassage?</p>

<p>A lot of these are rhetorical, just trying to point out the fallacies and that its a complicated long confusing issue that I dont’t beleive the sincereity of the post other than to lay down turph.</p>

<p>Peace out.</p>

<p>Easy, Q followers tend to be deep supporters of the administration. Why would the administration go out of it&#39;s way for die hard supporters. As for reporters I think many people vastly overestimate how much people care about 4chan or Q more than a passing curiosity.</p>

<p>&gt;Easy, Q followers tend to be deep supporters of the administration</p>

<p>How can you justify just dictating statements like this?  How do you know? Did you collate the information yourself? Polls? No, you are just labeling or taking it from someone else that did. This, unlike other issues that people can go around and around, with years of data.  Here, this is why people think its astroturphing.  Just blatantly labeling an entire group or demographic.  And this:</p>

<p>&gt;As for reporters I think many people vastly overestimate how much people care about 4chan or Q more than a passing curiosity.</p>

<p>You think? Where is your data or isi this another just you feel righteous and believe so much that its all a larp,  you cognitive bias your way through things like this?</p>

<p>Hey man, I am not looking for a fight.  I don&#39;t know enough to know myself, but I do know that twitter, youtube, many grass roots other social media are trending on this stuff, and there is a definite pushback on trying to stop it.  I don&#39;t know if its a real deal, psy-op or what have you.  But these reductionist posts based on arrogant knowitforafact posts don&#39;t feel genuine to me...and this isn&#39;t just a larp, and I will not get into a list making bullet point argue about reflections in a fucking picture timestame +++ bullshit.  The only list I will point is the ever growing out of 2 standard deviations the number of people in high political or federal office being fired, resigning, or stepping down along with a long list of powerful media types, Charlie Rose, Weinstein, and others.</p>

<li><p>To what end what end would the administration disavow Q when the whole thing has created a congregation of people who have exhibited a complete willingness to defer to Trump on all matters? </p></li>
<li><p>Even if we allow for the belief that Q is actually someone in the administration, that does not actual provide proof for any number of the absurd claims stemming from him or his followers. Do you actually believe that Obama will be claiming Kenyan citizenship to avoid &quot;the Storm&quot;?

But it isn&#39;t important enough for the administration to comment on, and its totally ok with them because they support him? Um.... National security?

<p>Are you being serious? How old are you? How is an adult supposed to even read beyond that? </p>

<p>I truly believe this one really important person should address some anonymous random comments/allegations about them on some message board on an internet full of an innumerable number of anonymous random stuff typed about them on thousands/millions of sites/forum/msg boards. You understand that&#39;s all you&#39;re saying, right? 
Me and my anonymous internet friends who personally know no one involved really like this one anonymous message posted on this one message board so they need to address it or it&#39;s true. Yup, we&#39;re totally all reasonable rational adults and we are owed this answer or the random anonymous posted messages on the internet that we like are clearly true. And anyone who disagrees with the anonymous messages of our choosing posted on a message board of our choosing are shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People posted the very first &quot;Q drop&quot; which happened a few hours before his first standalone post on chan - inside a different LARP, called HighwayPatrolman (this one dealt with supposed capture of adrenochrome traffic) it has always been clear to that Q is a LARP.<br/>
HOWEVER,<br/>
After having gone against  some of the Q-guys, proving it is a LARP, and having read some of the drops, which have demonstrably not been &quot;insider&quot; information, like the Saudi coup about which I read an article a good few hours before Q claimed it, I realized that It doesnt actually matter that it is a LARP. This phenomenon has a different function entirely.</p>

<p>It doesnt matter to Qguys, and it does not really matter objectively, because the point of this whole LARP was never to prove beyond any doubt that it wasnt one. I fact, that doubt is what drags people in.</p>

<p>This Q thing is doing something else entirely, and it does seem like believing it is &quot;real&quot; constituted a part of it for some, but we are way past the point where it actually matters.<br/>
What matters is what Q wants, and what are his goals, and should we pursue them, neither of which are dependent on the OBVIOUS fact that it is a LARP.  </p>

<p>So I guess what Im saing is: It is not a great discovery that Q is a LARP, what matters is what is the function of it, and anyone with any sense should PROCEED CAREFULLY</p>

<p>The only real question was whether Q was a psy-op set up by intelligence agency operatives loyal to Trump to &quot;rally the troops,&quot; or whether he was a &quot;Pied Piper&quot; psy-op from the Shadow Government to eventually lead the people astray.</p>

<p>For my money, the best scenario that fits is that Q was created by Blackwater&#39;s Eric Prince. It makes sense in so many ways. Blackwater is composed of ex-military and intelligence people (who still have connections inside the government). They&#39;d know the conventions that Q uses, and have &quot;inside baseball&quot; scoops about what&#39;s happening in the government. Likewise, Blackwater is providing Trump&#39;s security. Meaning: They&#39;d be everywhere HE is. So it&#39;d be easy to snap off pictures of Trump at any location. The security detail is, for all effective purposes, invisible. No one ever pays attention to them.</p>

<p>Even people who have no idea about this theory will accidentally arrive at it . . . if only subconsciously.</p>

<p>For instance, I was watching some guy do a Q analysis of the latest drops, and he happened to say, &quot;Q is talking about the exact same thing that Eric Prince mentioned in a TV interview!&quot;</p>

<p>I felt like a kid playing a game, screaming, &quot;Warmer, <em>warmer.</em> You&#39;re hot! God, you&#39;re red-hot! Keep going in that direction!!!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My background is literature, philosophy and the Italian language, lol.</p>

<p>I have no computer skills, or military experience.</p>

<p>All I have is critical-thinking skills and an awareness of things going on in the news cycles.</p>

<p>(By the way, I&#39;m currently working on a book one of whose chapters covers the origins of what we today call &quot;The Deep State&quot;.) Because of studying people like Vannevar Bush [who created the Military Industrial Complex] and speculator Bernard Baruch [who used FDR like a puppet to implement the &quot;New Deal,&quot; which created the massive bureaucracy we know today in the U.S. government] I have the faintest outlines of how events unfold. </p>

<p>My wife was huge into the Q phenomenon.</p>

<p>As for me, I always tried to remain impartial about the Q thing. I like the <em>idea</em> of it. But I start to get skeptical when Q is like &quot;Trust Jeff Sessions. Trust the plan.&quot;</p>

<p>Sessions (in my estimation) is a blackmailed Deep State puppet. He was installed to obstruct Trump and to provide an &quot;insurance policy&quot; in case it was ever necessary to impeach the President (as a method to stop his nationalist policies from interfering with the current rigging of the system).</p>

<p>I despise Session, and most other establishment politicians. They&#39;re almost all on the take, in one form or another.</p>

<p>So when Q was encouraging his audience to be passive, to be &quot;trusting&quot; and apathetic, red flags went up for me.</p>

<p>I have no idea what game is being played. But it&#39;s a fascinating one. Nothing like it in my lifetime has ever happened.</p>

<p>So sit back and enjoy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already wholeheartedly agree with you in your perception of Q. Personally, I think it was a perfectly executed psyop meant to discredit the &quot;Reddit conspiracy community&quot; which is loosely (mainly via the MSM) associated to the &quot;4chan community&quot;.</p>

<p>Looking back nearly 2 years ago now at the Podesta emails and JC Instagram (the main facets of Pizzagate), I can see how those could have been used as a psyop to associate the leaks to HC merely to turn the election in Trump&#39;s favor - the timing was more than convenient. That being said, I do believe JC and Pedosta had some more than creepy shit that has never been &quot;debunked&quot;. Does that mean HC and Obama (who had JC over with a young boy to play ping pong at the White House for whatever reason, and apparently is the goto for 60k worth of hotdogs deliveries or Hawaiian hotdogs stands) were either ignorant, complicit, or used that knowledge for blackmail over others? </p>

<p>I also believe there are routine and ongoing campaigns of disinformation specifically geared towards Reddit, Voat, and 4chan. If they can&#39;t prove you wrong or discredit
You, they can muddy the waters with so much bullshit you&#39;ll never see clearly and divide the right extreme posts to Voat, left extreme to  Reddit to further the divide - and that is exactly what they&#39;ve ended up doing since it took them censoring the Pizzagate and other similar subreddits outright in the beginning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I was just using the name &quot;Blackwater&quot; since that&#39;s what the public knows. All the subsequent name-changes haven&#39;t changed the basis of the actual company. (I think their new name is XE.)</p>

<p>And you&#39;re right: Eric Prince is providing Trump security, while his sister is installed in Trump&#39;s cabinet (as Secretary of Education). </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read that there were something like 13 credible assassination attempts on Trump&#39;s life and that the only reason he&#39;s still alive is that Prince&#39;s company is protecting him. </p>

<p>The media itself gave several tipoffs that the secret service is as loyal to Trump as it was to JFK when he was assassinated. They ran news stories about how agents &quot;wouldn&#39;t take a bullet for the President&quot;.</p>

<p>Or how they were allowing trespassers onto the grounds of the White House (&quot;forgetting&quot; to turn on the security sensors, etc).</p>

<p>Like all other Deep State factions, they&#39;re Big Government Hillary voters. What was the Washington, DC rate for voting for Hillary? Something like 94%? </p>

<p>The secret service are part of that 94%.</p>

<p>While they used to be hard-nosed, crew-cutted conservatives, now they&#39;re recruiting directly from colleges and getting social justice warriors (who hate the President). </p>

<p><em>Why do your links not include Q&#39;s verification trip code?</em></p>

<p><em>Why did you post an imgur link of Q&#39;s completely out of character response (without the trip code) instead of just linking to the post itself?</em></p>

<p><em>Why am I looking at a re-post of the image in question, yet not looking at the original image Q allegedly posted?</em></p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;m highly skeptical of anyone who claims that Donald Trump is a genius who is playing 47-dimensional chess. Then again, there has been a significant push in the MSM as of late to discredit Q and we know what a political battleground this sub has become. </p>

<p>So if I am excessively downvoted for asking these questions and no good answers or links are forthcoming, that may offer some reason to be skeptical of the OP. At the very least, I&#39;d like to see the posts for myself. Please link them.</p>

<p>The term has been (very, very sadly) co-opted to mean anything BUT Live-Action in this nothing-fucking-matters-post-truth-bull****-world of the 21st century.  </p>

<p>Even the idea that somehow doing an ARG (or ARX) has now become LARPing makes me sad.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a platform for transmitting bat shit crazy talking points to various members of Congress and the media</p>

<p>By giving these ideas legitimacy through official mouthpieces of the right - such as Nunes, Jordan, Gaetz, etc.  - the Q narrative becomes a self fulfilling prophecy</p>

<p>It was from Q that those congressman got the marching orders to demand early drafts of the recent IG report, seeking out the smoking gun that the official report failed to produce</p>

<p>And in that regard Q is incredibly successful</p>

<p>But it remains unclear to me whether Q&#39;s purpose is to advance a particular agenda, or merely embarrass those that co-opt it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of. Fake is yournewswire adding an extra sentence to a quote to change its meaning.  Larping is when that guy livestreamed himself running to the russian embassy because a Hillary killsquad was after him for the evidence he just uncovered and was asking for help. There is a performance aspect to a larp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody involved in this had any access to air force one, Q is a random poster on 4chan/8ch who managed to hoodwink thousands of people (who will no doubt still believe every fucking thing he posts).  The air force one image in his last post was taken from a 2015 ABC news photo and poorly photoshopped.  </p>

<p>The entire thing is fake, it always has been fake.  There is no Q, there is no high level insider, it&#39;s fake.  It&#39;s fake.  It&#39;s fake.  Everything that comes from 4chan/8ch is bullshit.  It&#39;s fake.  It&#39;s fake. IT&#39;S FAKE. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that the chans were getting legit insiders giving out interesting information, like FBIanon and MegaAnon, so some nefarious group decided to start Q. How do you stop leaks from insiders? Or at least others from listening to them? You have the master insider. The one Q to bind them all. So if another legit insider comes along, Q can claim their illegitimacy and they are never believed again. So it doesn&#39;t matter what Q says as long as it crowds out real leakers.</p>

<p>People were diggimg into the Vatican, Rothschilds, Jesuits, Freemasons, etc. way before Q.   </p>

<p>The comments here are very interesting.  The top comments are Trump bashers instead of quality posts regarding the image and what it means.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already wholeheartedly agree with you in your perception of Q. Personally, I think it was a perfectly executed psyop meant to discredit the &quot;Reddit conspiracy community&quot; which is loosely (mainly via the MSM) associated to the &quot;4chan community&quot;.</p>

<p>Looking back nearly 2 years ago now at the Podesta emails and JC Instagram (the main facets of Pizzagate), I can see how those could have been used as a psyop to associate the leaks to HC merely to turn the election in Trump&#39;s favor - the timing was more than convenient. That being said, I do believe JC and Pedosta had some more than creepy shit that has never been &quot;debunked&quot;. Does that mean HC and Obama (who had JC over with a young boy to play ping pong at the White House for whatever reason, and apparently is the goto for 60k worth of hotdogs deliveries or Hawaiian hotdogs stands) were either ignorant, complicit, or used that knowledge for blackmail over others? </p>

<p>I also believe there are routine and ongoing campaigns of disinformation specifically geared towards Reddit, Voat, and 4chan. If they can&#39;t prove you wrong or discredit
You, they can muddy the waters with so much bullshit you&#39;ll never see clearly and divide the right extreme posts to Voat, left extreme to  Reddit to further the divide - and that is exactly what they&#39;ve ended up doing since it took them censoring the Pizzagate and other similar subreddits outright in the beginning.</p>
