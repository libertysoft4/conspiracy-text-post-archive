<p>They hated him because he is a piece of crap.   When it turned out their base matched his ideology they did a 180</p>

<p>This is exactly what trump is doing right now, hes reducing funding in areas we actually need funding in, IE social security, healthcare and other services, while increasing funding in the military and militarizing the police.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Social security is a scam. I would rather that my SS taxes and invest it how I want. Healthcare would be better with some competition incentivizes innovation, improves quality, and decreases costs. Once the government has a monopoly on healthcare, education, guns(security) they effectively own you.</p>

<p>Free choice is everything. Social Security takes your money and deprives you of free choice. Single payer takes your money and spends it for you and deprives you of free choice. Military and police are one of the few legitimate things we need from the government. The issue is too much bullshit laws the police need to enforce not too much police.</p>

<p>Anyone from the boomer generation would completely disagree with you.   My father and mother are both able to retire with a passive income due to social security, and invest their money however they want in a 401K if they so choose to.   They literally do not have to worry about retirement due to this. </p>

<p>Acting like social security takes your money and deprives you of free choice is because its been gutted over the last several decades.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I generally agree with that statement and Republicans <em>do</em> fuck up a lot but bear in mind Rs have significantly reduced the size and strength if the federal government in the past two years. Tax and regulation cuts hamper the ability of leftists to control their population. Jobs foster independence from the government while job killing regulations foster dependency on the government.</p>

<p>** When evaluating politics and policies ask yourself two very important questions; **</p>

<p>1) Does this policy protect freedom or restrict it. The purpose of government is to protect freedom not grant it when it feels like it. </p>

<p>2) Does this policy foster financial independence or does it encourage dependency on the government and hurt jobs.</p>

<p>Jobs create financial independence. Right now unemployment is at a 20 year low. The unemployment rate for blacks, Hispanic, and female Americans is at an <strong>all time ever low</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a nightmare for the party who is dependent on votes coming in from people on welfare and other entitlements. It’s not a coincidence that the same party passes job killing regulations and laws. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a link about how Tulsi Gabbard is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. That&#39;s what I get on this sub every time her name comes up. It doesn&#39;t really mean anything. Her voting record, positions, and rhetoric are outstanding. No one says anything of substance to say against Tulsi, because informed people tend to agree with her. But it&#39;s cool and edgy to say tat everyone sucks, right?</p>

<p>There are some great people in political office, and they deserve our support. I&#39;m a big fan of my representative, Jared Polis. Bernie Sanders is great too, maybe not perfect on foreign policy, but very well-meaning with a clear, strong economic agenda. These people are doing the actual work that needs to be done politically, while anarchists sit on the sidelines complaining. Stop bitching and start a revolution.</p>

Polis is a wonderful person; I&#39;ve met him many times. And a hard-working progressive and one of the top marijuana legalizers in the country. He started the Cannabis Caucus in Congress, to legalize weed. And what the fuck have you done?</p>

<p>Nor did he know a thing about Russian privatization vouchers when he was 18. Speaking very little Russian, he went to Russia one summer to witness the fall of communism firsthand.

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very important point and I agree with you almost completely...but I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s ALL theater.  Theater implies there is a single stage-director.  In the case of domestic American politics, I think there is significant circumstantial evidence that there are at least two stage-directors.  For example: if the game ALL rigged and Trump was bound to win, why would the Democrats/DNC/Clintons bother killing Seth Rich?  Was that an act of theater meant only for us &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;?  Ultimately, the important takeaway for me is that it isn&#39;t just countries that have propaganda, but also parties within countries.  Meta-ultimately, it is the bankers&#39; and corporatists&#39; theaters that subtly control the party-theaters.  Thoughts?</p>
