        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m a juggler, so I travel a lot. I&#39;ve worked with an ecologist and fire prevention expert in Lakeport, California to know that the major fires in the area were caused deliberately. Fire does not fucking start in 8 places simultaneously in a half circle around a major geographical location. Also, I know that the sun does not have a rainbow halo around it normally, yet, in certain areas that are predominantly agricultural do, but only after they spread the chemtrails. These are just a couple of my observations that lend me the opinion that we are ruled by complete fucking sociopaths who do not give a flying fuck about us.</p>

<p>The main super power of the sociopath? Lying. Get surrounded by a group of liars anything is possible.</p>

<p>Is it possible that shootings have happened that weren&#39;t orchestrated. Yea, sure, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShrugLifeSyndicate/comments/8l49a5/returning_to_civilization_or_how_i_escaped_a_cult/">I just escaped a cult</a> and know the extent that minds can be warped. Since escaping, that&#39;s all I see other people as. They&#39;re zombies and completely don&#39;t understand evolution. If evolution can be seen as a series of random tests, then on a long enough timeline, the simulation will produce an apex predator. Then, once the system begins to tilt in the favor of the apex predator, it creates the room for one more to stand on the shoulders of man. The reptile people are those who evolved as parasites to The Body. </p>

<p>They feed of our suffering. More accurately, they keep us locked in their fucking matrix reality with fear! Jesus Christ, Hitler rose to power by being charismatic in front of a camera, and now we&#39;re in a post-nuclear world. Do you think any scale-skinned fuckboy is going to risk losing their slice of the pie? No. Game theory does not allow for any rounds of Russian Roulette. They would minimize the risk of thermonuclear annihilation by brainwashing the public so they could be herded to the slaughter.</p>

<p>Look at my balls. Where&#39;s your attention? Working on stage, I know how easy it is to manipulate someone. Just throw their attention somewhere and they already forgot what they were thinking about. Like, I see how it&#39;s done now, after everything I&#39;ve been through. The population has been gas-lit over multiple generations by Hollywood, which is more than just a place, it&#39;s a network of individuals who uphold the same lies.</p>

Alright, so like I go to doctor A, and they have a risperidone clipsboard and clock and other merchandise. Three guesses what I&#39;m prescribed within five minutes of meeting this woman for the first time. I go to doctor B. She&#39;s got different sponsers. And hey, I get prescribed something different after ten minutes of small talk with her. Do this a few more times. I get a  different diagnosis each time because the practice is bullshit and to prove it, I&#39;m going to become a psychiatrist and expose the whole fucking charade</p>

<p>Also, I was raped by an undercover nurse with breast cancer at St Joseph&#39;s in Syracuse New York because they do that with people with sexual disorders/problems in order to get us to trust them and talk about this shit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s as weird as these comments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was in 2nd grade, we had this weekly raffle where the teacher would pick names from a bucket to do the chores around the room. Obviously, this was a hot ticket item that every kid wanted, so there was a serious desire to win the lottery, from a peer-pressure standpoint.</p>

<p>One day I notice that everybody is folding their papers in half. In that moment, I decide to fold mine in thirds. Guess who got a chore pretty much every week from then on.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I actually work for the CIA. I&#39;m the spectacle of the moment (messiah candidate) and my job is to help wake people up from the matrix. Like a man yelling at the city gates that the empire is collapsing, I&#39;m saying we need to prepare for departure. Space Force is the joke of the moment, but what do you really think it&#39;s for? We have to start colonizing other worlds soon. That means we need thriving communities that can coexist with each other. To save as many lives as possible, we need to start figuring our who goes to what colony, because something stupid like a disagreement of how to run the show. </p>

<p>Or you know, you could be someone like me, go out across the country for a job at a nonprofit with my girlfriend only for it to be a top secret school for those about to get really big in the public eye, and then come to realize that gay side of yourself you&#39;ve been trying to hide for so long just can&#39;t take the stress of the batshit insanity you just escaped. I mean, she&#39;s not talking to me and we were best friends. That shit would destroy an entire colony if it happened at a vulnerable time in its development.</p>
