<p>I recently acquired a new phone,  the ZTE Fanfare 3 which was quickly set up for me by a very helpful employee. It was promptly destroyed a few weeks later when I fell asleep in the tub while reading. </p>

<p>I aquired another one,  but decided to set it up myself  instead of allowing the store employee to do it for me .  I am extremely happy I did!</p>

<p>One of the first screens I was greeted with upon setup was one advocating I give the phone access to &quot;record audio, take pictures,  and record video <strong>without having to ask permission</strong>&quot;.  </p>

<p>WHAT?!  <strong>No motherfuckers,  I do NOT allow this phone to record audio and video without having to ask me permission.</strong>
Obviously,  I denied this phone my permission to spy,  and realized that the kid at the cellular service store had been instructed to give everyone&#39;s phone permission to do so,  <strong>without asking the customer</strong>.</p>

<p>Sure as shit,  as I began to use my new phone on the internet,  I became absofuckinglutely shocked at the number of websites which seek to record video and audio of you while you peruse their site for information. About 10% of the sites we visit want audio and video of us,  surreptitiously gathered by our phones given unknown permissions at the cellular service store.   </p>

<p>Since I didn&#39;t give permission for this bullshit,  my phone  (supposedly) has to ask permission to record every time it is prompted by a website  and I get the following requests in a pop-up on my screen.</p>

<p>This is ridiculous.  I had no idea until I set up my own phone that the cocksucker employees at Cricket,  Verizon,  Apple,  etcetera are just giving our phones mass permissions to spy on us as they set them up for service.  They sure never asked <strong>my</strong> permission when they set it up for service, and that is my goddamn phone.</p>

<p>Anyone unaware of this whom didn&#39;t properly deny the permissions at setup is now daily being recorded by their phone without permission,  prompted by some of the websites they visit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was wondering about this; factory reset will start us from absolute square one where these permissions decisions will be put forth again?  We wouldn&#39;t,  for some reason, be started on square two,  where we no longer have access to initial permission decisions or any way to know if they previously existed, for example?

    <div class="md"><p>i work at an at&amp;t and we are required to default to the most private settings when setting up phones. if we &quot;allow a phone to take pictures etc without requiring permission&quot;, we need to state that to the customer. it&#39;s easier to avoid that conversation and set it up as private as id expect my own phone to be because we&#39;re all on the same side here. noone likes spying. im sure mistakes happen though.</p>

<p>You will have to back this up with actual proof. This is not believable unless you are going to some sketchy ass sites.</p>

<p>&quot;Firefox wants to record audio&quot; probably so you can dictate a URL to it&#39;s search bar or something. That doesn&#39;t mean the actual site your are on want&#39;s to use your microphone, which would be a different dialog within Firefox, not an OS permission.</p>

<p>If you use Chrome check this out
chrome://settings/content?search=camera</p>

<p>It IS possible for someone with access to your device to make it so sites don&#39;t need to ask permission to turn on your mic or camera. If employees are modifying such a setting on your phone or computer then they are basically criminals in my mind.</p>

<p>I am asked permission several times per day from random sites which are not considered &quot;sketchy&quot;, but mainstream.    </p>

<p>This has nothing to so with dictating a URL.   I&#39;ll connect to a site and,  as the page loads,  these permissions pop up. They are only popping up now because I denied this  phone the ability to record without my permission. I used this same model  of phone for a month previously with no such behavior.  I am 100% certain I&#39;m not accidentally activating a speech-to-text function. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firefox probably asks permission for itself to access your devices microphone/camera before it asks for site specific access later. That pop-up is annoying and the blame goes to Mozilla for persistently asking you for a permission you previously denied, not to the sites themselves. It&#39;s weird FFox would constantly ask for your permission. It&#39;s either a bug/flaw in FFox or you may have a malicious browser extension or other exploit on your phone which is injecting code on sites you visit in order to spy on you.</p>

<p>If you give me an example of such a site where you see this message I can verify whether the site is actually requesting the camera or mic. Most legit sites do not ask for these permissions unless you are actually requesting to use such a feature. If your site just asks every user for camera access for no reason you are well on your way to being blacklisted by search-engines like Google.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who managed both a Verizon and T-Mobile store, this post is laughable. Number one, the employees are not instructed to set your phone up to spy on you. They will just skip through the setup screens as quickly as possible since they 1) dont give a fuck, 2) are trying to rush through the setup to get done with the sale. Second of all, if you care about privacy (and are a female) DONT go to a fucking store and leave your phone with a random employee... You are dealing with bored kids for the most part who will look through your phone unfortunately for pictures of your tits (I&#39;ve seen so many employees do this). Finally, these stores will try to scam you into buying shit you dont need as the employees work off commission so just buy your phone online and set it up yourself. It&#39;s 2018, all of these phones are so simple to set up and transfer your info over there is litterly no reason to waste your time walking into a retail store unless you want the phone instantly and if you do you can purchase it and set it up when you get home while doing other shit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What!? You completely misread my post. When you set up the phone your clicking through the setup screens by hitting agree a bunch of times. Employees find this repetitive and dont exactly read what they are agreeing to so they just hit wherever it says agree to speed through it... some screens are optional agreements such as privacy settings, and mandatory agreements that won&#39;t let you continue without agreeing that are not privacy based. </p>

<p>I am CLEARLY saying they do NOT give any fucks about your privacy! You are dealing with people who care 0 about you and 100% about getting you out the door as fast as possible while making as much money from you as possible. The equivalent of sleazy used car salesmen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am NOT in agreement with you at all. I am speaking as someone who worked in the industry and trying to inform of what goes on as an insider.</p>

<p>Dont get butthurt about it man, cell phone stores are not your friend. They are instructed to not waste time and turn as much profit as possible off each customer. You can change the privacy settings on your phone but I would never trust an employee to be looking out for your best interest. They will check every box and hit next while setting up your phone because it is FASTER. </p>

<p>Here and there you might find an employee that cares a little more, but there is a high turnover in employees and most just care about there own paycheck which means SELL SELL SELL and get to the next customer as quickly as possible. Spending too much time with a customer and not making a sale will get you reprimanded while the ones that oversell and get you out the door as fast as possible to work with the next customer get praised. It&#39;s the culture of the industry and a lot of sales in general.</p>
