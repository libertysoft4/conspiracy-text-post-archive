        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey so I&#39;m 22 and have begun to realize the damage that has been done to my male qualities. Such as aggressiveness and energy, assertiveness and confidence. For me, a big part of this was pornography abuse, which I had no idea was a big deal but by abstaining have certainly become quite a different person. Honestly, people have referred to me as the &quot;new strongbad&quot; hahaha.</p>

<p>anyways I realize that porn is hardly the only part of the problem. i am here for advice on how to eliminate or reduce anything getting in the way of my absolute perfect health. Some things come to mind for me already: Purified water, close to nature food (whole food), careful with cosmetic products. </p>

<p>But how about video games? cell phone use? blue light? ALSO, I understand there has been a build up of harmful material in my brain, possibly on my pineal gland, whatever the case may be, does anyone here actually know how to get that shit out of my brain? Seems like a longshot to me. But I think anything is possible</p>

<p>I believe in the awesome power of the human body to repair itself over time. How can I ensure that I am doing as little damage as humanly possible. Also, how can i help my body repair itself? Thanks a lot!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok here i go on that note- I think firstly pornography use kills your drive to improve/compete/assert and mostly get real women in your life.</p>

<p>Now playing with yourself? I think that if you were to not do it, and not have sex, you would have a lot of pent up energy, with which you would have to do something with. If you have always been a &quot;fapper&quot; then you might be pissed off about it. But if you were a productive worker you could channel that energy into your work/productivity. But if you&#39;re sitting around just not masturbating and making no other changes I bet you might get angry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a couple of years I have problems with intimacy. There was some sexual and physical abuse when I was little and I had a fucked up first relationship with a girl that lasted for years and some other reasons that contributed to my fear for intimacy. Either way, porn was the only way of self love for me, it sounds fucked up because it is. I started when I was 13 or 14 and throughout the years it became a habit. I have a chronic depression, that doesn&#39;t mean I am depressed all the time. But I have been for longer periods in my life. Porn gave me the dopamine I was lacking at the time and it became a vicious circle. It affected my confidence and it was my comfort zone. I can go, but I am in bed now and going to sleep in a bit. So, if you&#39;re interested we can talk some more but that will be tomorrow or the day after. Take care!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you haven&#39;t already, come to Jesus. It won&#39;t be instant, but if you keep working on yourself, following Jesus&#39; word, you&#39;ll become even greater than you could imagine. I&#39;m not being sarcastic, and I&#39;m well aware what an unpopular opinion this is, but  give it a shot if you can. On top of living a good life, freeing yourself from the things you mentioned as well as unrighteous behavior, Jesus&#39; words are like the cherry on top. Becoming some sort of passive monk is an exaggeration, Jesus was righteous and directly stood against (((them))) in more ways than we can imagine, his words speak deep. Sorry not trying to proselytize, I just felt compelled to say something...Just my humble opinion, friends</p>

<p>Also, one time I cut out all foods with &quot;Natural Flavors&quot; for a couple of months, and by the end, I felt <em>incredible.</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s excellent!! Thank you for your open-mindedness. Of course, keep reading the Bible, and any time you question something, even if it&#39;s something science related or moral related that isn&#39;t in the book, search the web for people who talk about what you&#39;re questioning. One of the things that pulled everything to me so strongly was to just keep investigating the TPTB as deeply as you can and to look into ancient mythology and anthropology deeply. None of this stuff will outright show you God, but it will make it easier to see what the Bible(and much more) is talking about. I&#39;m grateful for this.</p>

<p>Good old prayer, and especially open-mindedness to God and Christ, will make him become more evident in your eyes. Keep your eyes peeled for lucky coincidences, timing of things, &quot;deeper meaning&quot; around you. This was what really compelled me(And many others), I could go on and on about how powerful these &quot;coincidences&quot; have been, they get easier and easier to see...This is just an aspect of the Holy Spirit, who is here to help and guide us. I started as a staunch anti-theist, brother. I, like many, been to some low places...If Christ could reach me, I think he can reach anyone.</p>

<p>Just keep an open heart and mind! Try and take Christ&#39;s message to heart as best as you can...So many people report better discernment, patience, conviction of sin, strength, passion, clarity, etc..I&#39;m sorry for the big post, and again, I&#39;m sorry to everyone who feels like this is too preachy, I try to not bring up my religious views very often.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there’s an epidemic with candida, yeast. Our diets consist mainly of complex sugar chains which are very difficult to break down. When it does go through our systems it feeds the single cell fungi, candida. Candida can pass the blood brain barrier and leaves amyloid plaque as a byproduct. Meanwhile symptoms of brain fog, fatigue, low sex drive, arthritis continue to grow. Basically reduce sugar intake. Eat a salad once a day, alkaline your gut and blood. Integrate turmeric and other anti inflammatory medicine into your diet and start off with googling the ebdocannabinoid system as well. Dr. Raphael Mechulom is a good watch. Also Dr. Sebi has a great following on healthcare. There’s also TCM! Do research and begin your shaman journey of healing </p>

Eat well, workout , find a path you enjoy in life. Failing that take testosterone, your pineal gland doesn’t calcify, again another myth. Go smoke some dmt or do acid though you’ll feel great for a few weeks after.</p>

<p>As another user said, lift weights. Or at least exercise, personally I&#39;ve built up enough injuries I stick to bjj nowadays, either way exercise helps.</p>

<p>Steroids aren&#39;t as bad as people act like they are (tons of false info that paints them in a bad light, though they do have drawbacks don&#39;t get me wrong) if that kind of enhancement is what you&#39;re interested in, you won&#39;t achieve any crazy T levels through natural means. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your list and a lot of the things discussed in this thread are very good. </p>

<p>Some things to do or incorporate would be resistance training and being on a regular sleep schedule. These help optimize and regulate the male hormones, which are mainly on a circadian cycle. Check out intermittent fasting, I’ve heard it prolongs peak testosterone levels in the morning and delays cortisol release which are big players in mood and focus. </p>

<p>Some things to avoid are keeping your cellphone in your front pocket, parabens in shampoos and deodorants, and foods that contain any phytoestrogens (soy is the most discussed one but others are used mostly as ingredients) </p>

I have a rare disease and by the time I was diagnosed, there was a 100% chance I&#39;d lose my kidneys. I followed this book and now am 93% better (4 years later). </p>

<p>My illness is what turned me into a crazy conspiracy theorist. Once I read the book and learned how the body utilizes certain minerals/is affected by certain toxins, the conspiracy stuff started to become very real. Why is there fluoride in water when fluoride is a neurotoxin? Most Americans are iodine deficient, yet the AMA insists that iodine supplements aren&#39;t necessary because salt is iodized. Interestingly enough, when the body is low on iodine, it will pick up fluoride and utilize it as a replacement for iodine... which is what causes the pineal gland to harden. This is one example of a zillion. </p>

<p>Good luck! I am glad to see your eyes open up at such a young age. We need the young people to step up to the plate and save society. It sounds like you are getting yourself poised. </p>

The Industrial Revolution has radically altered man&#39;s environment and way of life, and it is only to be expected that as technology is increasingly applied to the human body and mind, man himself will be altered as radically as his environment and way of life have been.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also a good way to gauge if you have candida build up is look at your tongue first thing in the morning. In Ayurvedic health the tongue is a map of the body. The Ayurvedic approach has been used for thousands of years. This is a good website to examine their techniques to using he tongue and also what certain characteristics mean.
