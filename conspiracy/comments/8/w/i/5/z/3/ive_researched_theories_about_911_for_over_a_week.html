    <div class="md"><p>Honestly as far as conspiracies go, many of them I&#39;ve been extremely skeptical of. Especially if they include supernatural elements or a over-the-top sinister elite. 
9/11 being an inside job to some degree seemed the most reasonable. Maybe the government knew about the whole thing and decided to do nothing, or simply knew there was going to be an attack to some extent and let it happen. </p>

<p>Bush and the MIC definitely seemed to benefit out of it. His approval ratings shot through the roof and the call to go to war hasn&#39;t been higher since Pearl Harbor. It also gave birth to the Patriot Act, something I don&#39;t believe would have been able to get through unnoticed if people weren&#39;t as scared from 9/11.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard so many convincing theories for the last eight years that I  figured that it must have been obvious that something wasn&#39;t right. It wasn&#39;t until the last few weeks that I&#39;ve decided on a whim to try to find people who actually opposed the theories directly. Videos on YouTube dedicated to challenging the conspiracy theories are generally in the minority and often heavily disliked. However many of them did bring up some interesting points that I admit have changed my mind on a few things.</p>

<p>So where I&#39;m at right now, I&#39;ve begun to doubt that any explosives were involved; or anything besides the two 767&#39;s. Whether the intelligence agencies knew about it is harder to prove or disprove. </p>

<p>I respond with: They found unused nano thermite in the dust left over from the collapses.</p>

<p>Do you say....</p>

<p>Nah, that&#39;s not real and I have seen Stephen E Jones and his videos, I&#39;ve seen the great debate on if thermite can be used to cut steel and I&#39;m not convinced.  Don&#39;t bother me with that, anything else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, I&#39;ve heard some other sources talking about the alleged use of &quot;nano thermite.&quot; Most of the arguments that challenge that theory have a few points. Those include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The study that claimed that nano thermite was used collected the samples years after 9/11</p></li>
<li><p>The people who conducted the study refused to share the samples with any reputable institution.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. James Millete sondicated four samples of dust from 9/11. To Jones&#39;s credit, Dr. Millete&#39;s spectral analysis did match the ones in Jones paper. The main difference however was that Millete actually did more analysis on the spherules and found out that they didn&#39;t contain any Aluminium. </p></li>
<li><p>The Open Chemical Physics Journal that published and claimed to have peer reviewed the study is an unaccredited journal that was caught <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17288-crap-paper-accepted-by-journal/">approving science papers that were randomly generated.</a>  </p></li>

<p>-Thermite is made up of <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Thermite">mostly Aluminum and Iron Oxide</a>, commonly found in electronics and in rust. </p>

<p>From his email - 
&quot;Scott Forbes, who was a senior database administrator for Fiduciary Trust, located on the 97th floor of the South Tower received a remarkable notice three weeks before the 9/11 attacks. The Port Authority of New York informed his company that there would be a “power down” on the weekend of Sept. 8 and 9, 2001. This would mean that all power would be off in the top half of the south tower for most of the weekend.</p>

<p>Forbes has called this unprecedented, because to have a data centre lose power for two days requires major preparations and disruption. He reports that as part of the power down, all security cameras and security door locks were non-operational for about 36 hours.&quot;

<p>Note that it is extra security in response to the phone threats that was removed. The standard level of bomb-sniffing dogs was still present, even one of the dogs was killed when the first tower collapsed. Even if all bomb dogs had still been present, their presence would have been ineffective (i.e. they would have been unable to detect explosives being planted in the pillar), or they wouldn&#39;t have been able to stop a rushed-job where sufficient explosives were somehow added overnight without being detected.</p>

<p>Repair crews work in my building about every couple of months, especially on the elevators. The elevators in WTC had 8-foot-by-5-foot motors and could carry 3x more people than the average elevator, they were the first in North America and the biggest in the world.

<p>There is no explanation for Building 7 collapsing at the rate of acceleration of gravity (freefall speed) other than there was no resistance from anything below the falling roof line. Zero resistance. That is only possible if all structural support is artificially removed. Otherwise, even in a catastrophic failure, there would be resistance sufficient to appreciably slow the collapse. The physics has been calculated, if you want to look it up. Nist was forced to admit, after being challenged on this, that Building 7 did indeed collapse at freefall speed for the first number of seconds. They offered no explanation for this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Thats where you are wrong. There was no explanation for the Building 7 collapse in the 9/11 commission report because Building 7 was a not a target. The report on building 7 was handled by NIST.  They were the ones who did a full <a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/faqs-nist-wtc-7-investigation">88 page report on WTC 7</a> as well. Along with multiple other reputable science and engineering institutions. WTC 7 fell over 7 hours after WTC 1 &amp; 2. The building was slammed by burning debris from both towers and on fire for most of the same time. The damage from the fires and other two WTC&#39;s damaged the main source of water for the fire suppression systems. It was too risky and too much was going on for firefighters to risk putting it out. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Otherwise, even in a catastrophic failure, there would be resistance sufficient to appreciably slow the collapse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False pseudo science, the <a href="https://hips.hearstapps.com/pop.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/06/480x228/54cfbbb69918b_-_wtc-nist-lg.jpg?resize=768:*">interior design of WTC 7</a> is not a secret (also check out figure 1-5 in NIST report). You are comparing it to other buildings around it&#39;s size. The untamed heat from the fires expanded the long support beams which caused the connections and floors to fail. The interior columns already were collapsing when the outshell of the building collapsed with it. Nothing about what caused the collapse of WTC 7 changed in the NIST report.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The physics has been calculated, if you want to look it up. Nist was forced to admit, after being challenged on this, that Building 7 did indeed collapse at freefall speed for the first number of seconds. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>False again, read section <a href="https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610">1A section 3.6</a> of the final NIST report that defines the calculations determining the rate and speed which WTC 7 fell, including in the video. The first 1.75 seconds were too slow to be a free fall. The NIST report already stated that it did accelerate and go into a free fall speed between 1.75 and 4 seconds of the collapse, it was at the last second and a half it slowed it&#39;s acceleration again. Buildings that are demolitioned generally either speed up or fall consistently from the point the explosives are detonated. (They also have loud ground shifting explosions)</p>

<p>Thats where you are wrong. There was no explanation for the Building 7 collapse in the 9/11 commission report </p>

<p>Did I say there is no explanation in the 9/11 commission report? No, I did not. I said there is no explanation for it - to be had - anywhere - period. So, I am not wrong - your presumption is wrong. 
&quot;False pseudo science&quot;,&quot;False again&quot; - Judge much?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it one last time. A building cannot fall at freefall speed <strong>for even one second</strong> unless there is absolutely no resistance. This is only possible if the structural supports have been artificially removed. By the way, go fuck yourself. I can&#39;t stand your attitude and have zero desire to continue any further discussion with you. If you have a SO, I pity them. If not, you will make someone totally miserable someday. You&#39;re a shitty person, plain and simple. I&#39;m always up for some good open-minded conversation on <strong>any</strong> subject and enjoy a good passionate debate - but never with an asshole.</p>

<p>Typical coward. You never had any intention to debate anyway. You saw that your argument wouldn&#39;t withstand facts so now you run away because you are all out of bs to spew. Stick to the Flat Earth forums m8.</p>

<p>There is literally an 88 page explanation of the collapse. Plus multiple other studies that support it. Simply not wanting something to exist doesn&#39;t magically make it dissapear. However I understand that the cognitive dissonance to ignore it is a defensive mechanism to avoid having your beliefs debunked.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>False, that is not how gravity works. Watch the penthouse at the top of WTC 7 during the initial collapse. The WTC buildings are tube framed steel-columned buildings. As you can see <a href="https://shellbuckling.com/presentations/architecture/fullsize/jom2001eagar.gif">here</a>, most of the supports are within the center frame while the perimeter is much more open for office space. It serves more as an exoskeleton of the central structure. The central structure was already collapsing due to the fire, the outer shell simply fell with it because they were supported by the central structure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only comprehensive studies done of the WTC7 collapse are those of NIST, Arup, and Weidlinger. </p>

<p>Each one, by the way, came up with a different collapse sequence. While I don&#39;t know much about the Arup and Weidlinger studies, I can tell you that the authors of the NIST study:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>examined no physical evidence,</p></li>

<li><p>and explained that they didn&#39;t test for thermite because they couldn&#39;t imagine how 100lbs of thermite could have been infiltrated into the building and placed without anyone seeing <em>even though the building stood completely empty for hours on 9/11</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The NIST study is plainly fraudulent, and the Arup and Weidlinger studies are based on it. </p>

<p>In other words, no serious organization has done a comprehensive, good faith study of the collapse. </p>

<p>The expert in structural fire design working for ARUP, Dr. Barbara Lane actually agreed that the fire caused the collapse. She only argued that the loss of fireproofing from the impact of the lane would not have stopped the fire from destroying both WTC 1&amp;2. </p>

<p>The Weidlinger were a private firm that conducted the study in 2015 revolved primarily around a claim of negligence, with Aegis and others seeking to recover losses against 7 WTC Co. and others for what they alleged was negligent design and maintenance of WTC 7 that contributed to the collapse of that tower. The NIST report is consistently referenced in defense that they were not liable. </p>

<blockquote>

Do you have proof of that? The simulations and calculations matched the result of the collapse. </p>

<p>Read Section 8.3.2, 3.9,  and 4.6 of the final NIST report. Can you explain the significance of how those effected the collapse in your own words?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>initially underestimated the width the bearing seat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proof? So you are admitting that the inward bowing caused the top floors to collapse and not explosives? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>released only the first two seconds of their collapse animations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God forbid authors start making books without pictures. The report describes in detail how and what happened. It was a safety report and the simulations were just a visual aid that was initially made to 
test theories. Plenty of people have recreated their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOKJ4ZXgK4Q">own simulations</a> with the data given. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>explained that the reason they didn&#39;t check for explosives...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t check for bullet holes in the walls either. They would have been equally as apart of taking the building down if there were after the planes hit. So which narrative are you going with, that NIST is incompetent for not doing more thorough testing for bullets, or they are trying to cover it up? Otherwise, why didn&#39;t they just say they found no evidence of explosives? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and explained that they didn&#39;t test for thermite because they couldn&#39;t imagine how 100lbs of thermite...</p>

<p>A thousand pounds of thermite couldn&#39;t burn all the way through a car. So for literal tons of thermite to be snuck in but have no function is quite odd. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>So the NIST is not a serious organization, however the Open Chemical Physics Journal is? </p>

<p>Good thing about physics, and most fields in science and mathematics, you already have the solution once you have solved the variables. The Laws of Physics don&#39;t change because of your personal beliefs or anyone elses. Consensus among every reputable science journal and institution is that the NIST report is that the inward bowing caused by the hyper fueled fire brought down the towers. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>examined no physical evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the NIST WTC7 FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>NIST&#39;s entire investigation included no physical evidence. How can the investigators be so sure they know what happened?</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, much less evidence existed for WTC 7 than for the two WTC towers. The steel for WTC 1 and WTC 2 contained distinguishing characteristics that enabled it to be identified once removed from the site during recovery efforts. However, the same was not true for the WTC 7 steel. Certainly, there is a lot less visual and audio evidence of the WTC 7 collapse compared to the collapses of the WTC 1 and WTC 2 towers, which were much more widely photographed.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the NIST investigation of WTC 7 is based on a huge amount of data. These data come from extensive research, interviews, and studies of the building, including audio and video recordings of the collapse. Rigorous, state-of-the-art computer methods were designed to study and model the building&#39;s collapse. These validated computer models produced a collapse sequence that was confirmed by observations of what actually occurred. In addition to using its in-house expertise, NIST relied upon private-sector technical experts; accumulated copious documents, photographs and videos of this disaster; conducted first-person interviews of building occupants and emergency responders; analyzed the evacuation and emergency response operations in and around WTC 7; performed computer simulations of the behavior of WTC 7 on Sept. 11, 2001; and combined the knowledge gained into a probable collapse sequence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is a bit funny insofar as there is one bit of steel that was preserved and studied from WTC7 by FEMA. You can read out it in this <a href="https://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">Limited Metallurgical Examination</a>. What&#39;s more there were plenty of dust samples collected and preserved by the USGS that could have been tested for explosive or incendiary residues--while it would have been impossible to attribute any dust sample exclusively to WTC7, any suspect residues in the dust would have warranted a more thorough investigation into how explosive or incendiaries might have been used.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you explain the significance of how those effected the collapse in your own words?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. You won&#39;t like it though. </p>

<p>The absence of the welded side plate allowed the girder A2001 to walk off the bearing seat. Had it been included in the model, a thermally expanded A2001 would have been trapped by the overlap.</p>

<p>The absence of the shear bolts allowed K3004 (IIRC) and the other beam framing into A2001 to expand enough to displace the girder 5.5&quot; (later revised to 6.25&quot;) and push it to the very edge of its 11 inch (later changed to 12) bearing seat. Had the the bolts been included, the displacement would have been greatly reduced. </p>

<p>The absence of the partial height web stiffeners allowed the lower flange of the A2001 to buckle at the edge of the bearing seat, and the girder to subsequently slide off. Had the web stiffeners been included the lower flange would not have buckled and the girder would have remained perched precariously on the edge of the bearing seat. </p>

<p>Regarding the width of the bearing seat NIST had this to say in 2012:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=901225">The bearing seat at Column 79 was 
<del>11</del>
12
in. wide. Thus, when the girder end at Column 79 had been pushed laterally 
at least 
<del>5.5</del>
6.25
in., it was no longer supported by the bearing seat.</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding the simulations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God forbid authors start making books without pictures. The report describes in detail how and what happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their entire hypothesis is based on computer models which do not even vaguely resemble what happened in reality. I really don&#39;t know how else to put it: their models were complete shit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They didn&#39;t check for bullet holes in the walls either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stupid argument. Bullets don&#39;t bring down buildings while explosives and incendiaries obviously do. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A thousand pounds of thermite couldn&#39;t burn all the way through a car.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What was that? A Mythbusters episode? Look at what <a href="https://youtu.be/5d5iIoCiI8g?t=8m58s">one engineer accomplished with thermate in his own back yard</a>. I recommend watching the whole thing. This guy is awesome. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consensus among every reputable science journal and institution is that the NIST report is that the inward bowing caused by the hyper fueled fire brought down the towers. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A.) Consensus has no bearing on reality.</p>

<p>B.) We aren&#39;t talking about the Twin Towers, we&#39;re talking about WTC7</p>

<p><strong>So what have we learned today?</strong></p>

<p>The same way NASA scientist figured how to get machines on other planets and people on the Moon. It&#39;s called science m8, they apply what they know about the observable universe to calculate accurate depictions of what happened. They had all the information they needed about the tube framed steel column infrastructure of WTC 7. They knew the exact makeup of the support structure and the aircraft, along with it&#39;s exact velocity. Focusing on debris wouldn&#39;t give them information they didn&#39;t already know.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>WTC7, any suspect residues in the dust would have warranted a more thorough investigation into how explosive or incendiaries might have been used.</p>

<p>Used for what? The issue with the explosives theory is that there were no explosives that contributed to the collapse of the building in the first place. If there were literally multiple tons of thermite in the building it would have came down a lot sooner. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure. You won&#39;t like it though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Copying from Szamboti and Hulsey I see. Anyway, it was the axial expansion that generated large force for the bolts to fail. The assumption that columns 44 and 79 can&#39;t move in relation to each other is ridiculous. A2001 beams were not the only ones that heated. It wasn&#39;t the first thing that actually failed either. There was actually a number of collapses happening at the same time. I&#39;m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but you&#39;ve only been tricked by more pointless psuedo scientific fodder. Even Szamboti in his own argument with Mick West got exposed for misreading the A2001 to C79 connection in the NIST model. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their entire hypothesis is based on computer models</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The computer models were merely simulations meant to visually analyse the data and communicate the results. The program didn&#39;t create the data itself. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stupid argument. Bullets don&#39;t bring down buildings</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither do simultaneously quiet yet powerful explosives. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look at what one engineer accomplished with thermate in his own back yard. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thermate and Thermite are not the same thing. Secondly, the same YouTube that cited the &quot;peer reviewed&quot; study about the red chips, the one that already <a href="http://oystein-debate.blogspot.com/2011/03/steven-jones-proves-primer-paint-not.html">debunked after independent researchers discovered it was just primer paint</a></p>

<p>Not as awesome when you learn that the Barium Nitrate in thermate is too toxic. Hundreds more people would have died from breathing in barium nitrate and it would be extremely easy to find and identify in dust samples. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what have we learned today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That you might be way over your head for debates like these m8. You rely too much on the reverse scientific method. You listen to half baked theories, ignore any data that doesn&#39;t fit your conclusion, and then hail their findings as the only possible conclusion. You&#39;ve never even explained how they would have snuck nearly a ton of thermite without being detected into one of the most secure buildings in NYC. 
Even if they somehow did, the real question is why not just settle with planes? </p>

<p>No, most of the connections and girders were already significantly weakened at that point because of the fires.

They all used a similiar tube framed steel column design. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>clever application of thermite, thermate...</p>

<p>Again, you&#39;re using the reverse scientific method and trying to throw away the evidence there was even a fire. You would have needed hundreds of pounds of thermite to cut through all of the necessary sheer connections and girders. It&#39;s not a Jenga tower, the core structure isn&#39;t supported by one column. It&#39;s extremely unlikely for thermate to have gone unnoticed, multiples hydraulic jacks wouldn&#39;t have survived for 7 hours on fire.

<p>100% of an object&#39;s gravitational potential energy is turned into kinetic energy while it&#39;s in free fall.

<p>You&#39;re argument is making even less sense now. You&#39;re just paraphrasing the definition of a freefall, you&#39;re not even arguing what it proves or disproves. The ole truther argument was that the explosives brought down WTC 7, which would have led to a fall with no resistance. The freefall was debunked, Stage 1&amp;3 help proved it was progressive collapse and not cd. </p>

<p>You fell back into claiming Thermite caused the columns to fail, you never even explained how the burning debris from the WTC 1. Did it magically disappear?</p>

<p>Thing is that argument works both ways. There are numerous academic publications that have called out the alleged evidence as well. NASA research scientist <a href="http://www.jod911.com/drg_nist_review_2_1.pdf">Ryan Mackey</a> is one example. </p>

<p>Labeling science as disinformation has not worked well for the Church and isn&#39;t going to work that well on any rational person. I&#39;m sure if we labeled round-earthers as being apart of a disinformation campaign with sinister agenda&#39;s, the effect would be the same.</p>

<p>Actually, scientist and <a href="http://zibili.com/sept11/91103.htm">photo evidence</a> say otherwise. A lot of passengers personal effects (and bodyparts) were found scattered around the area surrounding 9/11. That includes other passports, pagers, and even boarding passes. Explosions are not like what we see on TV. They are unpredictable and sometimes objects can be ejected by concussive force faster than they can be blown apart. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s always been one of the main issues with the truther community. There is hardly any real narrative other than &quot;try to create as much suspicion as possible&quot;. As if the narrative is to try to bombard the disaster with doubt instead of evidence. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure your list can go on for days, which Is kind of a problem. There have been hundreds of confirmed conspiracies, none of them are this over complicated and all had a central focus that led to one conclusion. A clue that led to other clues that would verify each other, not conflict or inflate.  </p>

<p>In fact the narrative seems artificial not by a government or sinister shadow organizations. It seems more likely that a French author got rich perpetuating misinformation shortly after the disaster. A handful of others saw the effect it was having and decided to cash in on it was well without the burden of reputation or an agreement with peers. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you remember, but people around the world were scared and anxious at the time. They wanted answers faster than anyone could logically give them. So they turned to whoever would provide them, this led to a get-rich-quick scheme that has been in fact getting a lot of people rich. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In case you haven&#39;t heard, when skeptics say &quot;why couldn&#39;t we hear 
 thundering explosions from the towers&quot; the narrative is to say that they embedded tiny amounts of nano-thermite in enough concrete to fill two football fields, or it was an alien laser, either one works. Why? Who knows anymore, it&#39;s more about trying to convince people it happened then trying to convince people its true. </p>

<p>The area was sectioned off and they merely tested what they had available. Keep in mind they didn&#39;t even finish after 4 years despite having hundreds of investigators, along with hundreds more private organizations, working on it.  </p>

<p>They already had on record the design plan for the building and video evidence of exactly where and when the planes hit. All they had to do was reconstruct the event and break it down scientifically. They had the resources to recreate whatever they need to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My reasoning behind believing this is a dud at this point is that it has now become more like arguing religion.</p>

<p>There are those that believe and those that don&#39;t believe. Anyone in the middle will be grouped to one side or the other based on the bias of the observer from one of the two groups. It can no longer be discussed rationally, IMO. </p>

<p>If you question evidence, you will be dismissed. And I say that generically, because it applies to both sides.</p>

<p>In most cases, both sides of the argument have propaganda at this point. By propaganda, I mean that the videos and articles presented are intended to sway an opinion. Both sides will leave out counter-facts or ignore facts to the contrary.</p>

<p>There are so many different theories out there and so many of them contradict other theories. They each present evidence to support their theories, but only one can actually be true. If the very same evidence can be used to prove multiple contradicting theories, then logically, the evidence needs to be scrutinized a little more.</p>

<p>Proof of this is that as others are reading my very generically written comment are already forming in their heads which &#39;side&#39; I am on as they are reading it. The responses will be framed in a way to determine which &#39;side&#39; I am on, so that they can decide whether to dismiss what I say or not. Some will accuse of it being bothsideism (a propagandist term in it&#39;s own right meant to push out objective thought.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll save those the trouble. I am not truly convinced either way. Even at this point. I have researched a lot and still do not have a conclusion. But I will continue to listen to arguments from both sides as objectively as possible. My bias wants to lead towards an inside job, but I recognize my bias, and that makes me work harder to be objective and open-minded. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I think: honestly, the &#39;no planes&#39; theories pretty much destroyed the truth movement. It is not a coincidence that the movement just died when these theories took precedence. For me, it was at that point that I recognized my bias and began questioning the objectivity of the sources of information I had trusted.</p>

<p>I remain with an open-mind, but the entire avenue of &#39;no planes&#39; theory is completely closed to me now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your first point. However it&#39;s not as equal as you make it seem. The researchers that argue with their evidence generally are not accredited or peer reviewed by any reputable journal. NASA and NIST scientist have debunked it. The self proclaimed scientist and researchers that argue their points generally have a habit of getting rich off a career of trutherism. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on both sides. I&#39;ve heard so many theories that I&#39;ve figured that it must have been true. When you actually begin to listen to those theories you begin to notice how many of them conflict with each other. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been open minded as well to both sides, however to a certain extent you have to be wise enough to understand that one side is significantly more flawed then the other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My advice to you is this:</p>

<p>Just think about this big picture... Think about EVERYTHING that happened that day, both towers, pentagon, WHERE the Pentagon was hit and what documents were destroyed, BUILDING 7, intact passports, of WHO supposedly did all this, supposedly reading the flight manual on the way to the airport, the 99 year lease of the towers by Larry Silverstein months before the collapse, tons of investments against before the collapse, so many allusions to a twin towers collapse in cartoons, tv programs, media, etc before it happened, a collapse that countless engineers and PhD&#39;s say was impossible, a seiemic impact a tiny fraction of what it should&#39;ve been... I could go on forever. Just think about the big picture here. Even if not all of the arguments are valid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s the totality of circumstances that convinces me the entire event the &quot;official account&quot; describes is highly improbable. Unfortunately it&#39;s quite challenging to lay out the entire case because of this; the sheer amount of &quot;small pieces&quot; that build the greater puzzle are astronomical. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve gone back and forth for years, but the evidence overwhelmingly points to a cover up, of at least <em>something</em>. Building 7 is by far the most powerful evidence- it&#39;s never been satisfactorily explained by ANY authority why all existing footage appears to show a controlled demolition. From this, a framework of sorts can be built- if you question that one event, all others somewhat fall in line. </p>

<p>For me, upon realizing the building 7 collapse was suspicious, the natural progression was to next review videos of the twin towers collapsing. It is quite evident there are some type of forces causing powerful lateral ejections (one might say, <em>explosive</em>) from points on the tower not yet collapsed. And so forth...the point is, just from carefully viewing primary source information, the narrative begins to shift. And you begin to wonder, if those parts aren&#39;t correct, what else isn&#39;t. This is before even reading one sentence of <em>theory</em> regarding the events. </p>

<p>But back to the post above. I&#39;d like to add Norman Mineta&#39;s testimony and the resulting shift/muddying of the timeline; additionally the shift in the official account when the previous claims of cell phone usage from the plane(s) were questioned. </p>

<p>Any implausibility that was credibly rebuked resulted in an alteration in the &quot;official account.&quot; This would not happen if, in fact, the official account portrayed the events honestly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s always been one of the main issues with the truther community. There is hardly any real narrative other than &quot;try to create as much suspicion as possible&quot;. As if the narrative is to try to bombard the disaster with doubt instead of evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure your list can go on for days, which Is kind of a problem. There have been hundreds of confirmed conspiracies, none of them are this over complicated and all had a central focus that led to one conclusion. A clue that led to other clues that would verify each other, not conflict or inflate.</p>

<p>There were allusions to the twin towers collapse in my living room. My curtains kind of look like the twin towers, and my kid used to like pulling them down. I guess he might have been in on it too, despite not being born yet. </p>

<p>Some 200 technical experts—including about 85 career NIST experts and 125 leading experts from the private sector and academia—reviewed tens of thousands of documents, interviewed more than 1,000 people, reviewed 7,000 segments of video footage and 7,000 photographs, analyzed 236 pieces of steel from the wreckage, performed laboratory tests, and created sophisticated computer simulations of the sequence of events that occurred from the moment the aircraft struck the towers until they began to collapse.
The general consensus among all of the worlds top reputable physicist and civil engineers, including NASA, agree with the report and often reference it for consultation.</p>

<p>I think you might misunderstand what the point of the report is. It&#39;s main purpose is to identify, as specifically as possible, areas in current building and fire codes, standards, and practices that warrant revision. In Layman&#39;s terms, explain what happened so people can learn how to improve buildings to prevent the same catastrophe from happening again to the same extent.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel took control over America when they had the CIA killed JFK. Since then America has been enacting the Israeli Likud party plan on The Greater Israel Project which is a plan to overthrow all Muslim goverments in the middle east so that Israel can obtain &quot;full spectrum dominance&quot; of the area. </p>

<p>911 was created by the same zionists. Bibi Netenyahu&#39;s father was one of the original Likud party members.  911 was a Zionist plot to trick Americans into supporting war in the middle east. All made possible by our Jew media and jew deep state intelligence agencies</p>

<p>No planes were hijacked on 911. Not by Muslims. Not by anyone.  Saudis Arabia had nothing to do with 911.  The official story says SA funded some of the hijackers, but as I just stated, there were no hijackers.  The intelligence agencies that make up the deep state fabricate evidence and frame muslims as they did on 911 and as they did in the newly released 28 pages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this has the potential to be a great discussion point especially if people give you access to the prices of information or evidence they felt most compelled to accept.</p>

<p>Personally for me - I find the official story an absolute work of fiction. I’d like to believe that ANYONE with some sense and understanding (or at least willingness to learn in areas they are less knowledgeable in) would be able to see this.
We go into hundreds of instances of this but some of this is already covered by others above - if you’d like I’d be happy to list them.</p>

<p>As a bare minimum- what was published as the official explanation for what happened doesn’t give justice or closure to those who lost their lives on that day. Somebody will always search for answers when you know what you’re being told isn’t true.</p>

<p>As a possible side point- when the finger ends up being pointed, hastily in this case I might add, to a group or individual you can easily label like “terrorists” it really sets off alarm bells. It’s a very old tactic within politics to segregate yourself and an enemy and use the enmity created from propaganda to sway decisions. Having a “boogie man” that you can “save the people from” has lead to some of the biggest atrocities in history - limited only by how sick the people in charge are. Very dangerous but also very obvious to spot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the first thing you have to do is try to remove the bias and approach the issue more objectively. That&#39;s something I did and started to see things more clearly. The first thing to do is abandon the &quot;official story&quot; rhetoric. The &quot;official story&quot; was a result of almost a half a decade investigation by the NIST in collaboration with hundreds of other research, physics, and engineering institutions from around the world.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve already been accused of just glossing over truther arguments and simply not getting convinced. That couldn&#39;t be further from the truth, in fact it was the opposite. Many of these presentations and research from truthers often do have some grain of truth. Such as Stephen Jones research into dust samples that he claims contained traces of red chips that looked similar to thermite. His spectral readings were correct, which shows that he probably did do some actual experiments on them. However, he made the conclusion that it was nano-thermite by visual distinction alone. Other researchers examined dust particles as well and find similar traces of iron spherules that looked similar, but further study shown the dust samples did not contain enough Aluminium to match thermite. </p>

<p>So how is somebody that is not a professional suppose to know what isn&#39;t true? That is practically just an admission that they may simply not want it to be true no matter what they hear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely agree. One has to approach these types of discussions objectively and set aside bias - not always easy but 100% agree with what you are saying there and personally I also try to approach everything I research with that in mind.</p>

<p>Having looked at a lot of content put together on the subject I think in some ways I have reached a similar point in terms of your overall questioning: who was involved? why would this be allowed (assuming there was foreknowledge of it)?
Those kinds of questions can open a whole other Pandora’s box that ends up in the realms of “who controls the world”. But in the context on 911 I’m nowhere near having a satisfactory answer to what the motive(s) were.</p>

<p>To pick up on your example of Stephen Jones and his methodology- again we agree here in what is covered above. A lot of people have done research on particular questions are 911 that are all in themselves valid questions given the official narrative (e.g. controlled demolition, media interference with the coverage, pentagon, building 7, etc). I don’t know if any one person has it all the answers or ever will - only because the government would have to confront it properly if that were the case. Even then, it’s more likely to end up being labelled conspiracy rabble like we’ve seen with other topics like JFK.</p>

<p>I don’t think you need to be a professional to know truth at all. What I meant in the context of what I’m saying is - for example - I am not a structural engineer but do find it highly unlikely that 3 buildings would collapse at free fall speed into their own footprint as a result of fire wearing those internal structures (the official narrative). Just using simple logic - a lot of demolition companies would be out of business if that were the case. I mean if building 7 collapsed so neatly into its footprint because of catastrophic fire damage - then why do we bother rigging up buildings with explosives now? Just light the thing on fire for a fraction of the price? 
However a lot of structural engineers and designers who understand structures way better than I ever will find what happened to be impossible or at the very least incredibly unusual. Lots of skyscrapers have been engulfed in flames for a lot longer and didn’t fail.</p>

<p>I studied economics so personally my interests have lead me down the path of following the money trail. There are many many things that are very unusual that I’d call statistically significant. There is some interesting work that was done into this - eg put options against airlines far above average daily amounts - that means a lot more money than normal being bet against certain airliners share prices rising. There’s a mine of stuff there but what I mean is there seems to be a lot more behind the story than “terrorist extremists”.</p>

<p>To some extent maybe you are right that if people don’t want to believe something, they probably won’t. No matter how compelling the evidence is. Keep it up and don’t become one of them</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think that is one of the vital things that make this so debatable. I&#39;m not a structural engineer either, I have to rely on simplified explanations from professionals to have some understanding of what happened. I couldn&#39;t begin to understand how the hell NASA was able to get a satellite close enough to pass by and photograph Pluto. A dwarf planet 4.6 billion miles away while it&#39;s moving 10,500 mph from a surface moving 67,000 mph. However what I do know is that it&#39;s possible, but requires a lot of explanation in matters that don&#39;t pertain to our everyday lives, so common sense typically gets thrown out the window since it&#39;s not that common.</p>

<p>9/11 is extremely similar in one way. What caused the main source of damage wasn&#39;t as simple or common as any standard explosion or fire. Majority of physicist and engineers agree that if it was simply just a plane ramming into the twin towers, the damage would would be severe, but mostly isolated to a few floors. Had it been only just a fire, first respondents and the buildings fire suppression systems could have handled it easily. </p>

<p>However it&#39;s not that simple, and all of the factors of the 767&#39;s ramming into the Twin Towers all complimented each other. The heat from the Jet fuel made the fire too hot to control. The impact from the plane severely damaged the fire suppression and damaged support columns. The rubble from the building engulfed the plane insulating the fire and creating a powerful furnace. This basically melted down parts of the aluminum in the plane spreading liquid molten metal down multiple floors. </p>

<p>This all built up to the real mindfuck. Something that people were not inherently used to seeing. A discovery so overlooked that even the structural engineers who did in fact design the WTC to survive an impact with a 707 didn&#39;t even think of. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.metabunk.org/data/MetaMirrorCache/15d987530fb19f490198129171c8d200.gif">this</a> </p>

<p>The inward bowing of the floor trusses had the tensile members lengthen due to creep under load and ceiling temperatures, causing the floors to sag (become bowl shaped), snap their fixings, and drop away. This basically turned almost the entire building above the fire to topple down and bring the rest of the building with it. You can see it <a href="https://youtu.be/TJJPYTVjxug?t=78">happening here</a> </p>

<p>Imo, I would see the destruction of the WTC in particular being probably one of the least profitable for companies. I&#39;ve heard hundreds of conspiracies as to why, yet those can&#39;t be pinpointed as scientifically so I don&#39;t tend to focus on them. One of my personal underlying theories as to why these theories regarding what brought down WTC are so prevalent is because NIST didn&#39;t finish their investigation until 4 years after 9/11. In the meantime, people took advantage of the global fear and got rich selling theories to validate peoples fears and anger. Some just found it as a perfect attack to use against Bush (who was a scumbag for what he did in Iraq) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what you mean it&#39;s common knowledge that the gold storage was cleaned out in the hours before the buildings came down. A quick Google should pull this up right away. The gold was never recovered even to date nothing has ever been done about it. As for the steel again this was common knowledge it was fast track and sold as bulk scrap before the dust even settled. Fast tracked to ships and carted across the globe to be buried on China. All sorts of this sort of nonsense was going on it just cements in the facts that this was a plot carried out by nwo  or who ever is pulling the strings.

<p>That and your argument are basically the same. You&#39;re asking to prove a negative. NASA scientist supported the NIST report which was an objective science based analysis of what happened. It wasn&#39;t a rebuttal to any other theories and it wasn&#39;t desperately trying to discredit other investigations with arbitrary accusations. It stuck plainly to facts and conducted research from scratch. They had access to most of the same tools as everyone else did, which made disproving the theories extremely harder than making them up.

<p>&quot;Ikr, and Round Earthers are ignoring basic laws of physics as well. Obviously when I look straight, I can see the world is flat, therefore the entire earth is flat.&quot; </p>

<p>That is the absurd logic you are using. NIST is using advanced physics to breakdown the collapse, as corroborated by expert physicist.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, I said they are one of the most qualified. More qualified then Rosie O&#39; Donnel and some Bishop that took a few engineering classes.</p>

<p>Because thermite can do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJJPYTVjxug">this</a>. Nice try, but it destroys your entire argument. I suggest sticking to the Flat Earthers, I&#39;m 100% sure they will have your back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, instead they used math to calculate the overall fall of the building in every video. </p>

<p>Here you go: </p>

<p>Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).
Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)
Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity</p>

<p>Nope, the pancake model was one of the old conspiracies based off visual observation. It&#39;s been widely debunked by NIST multiple times, it was the combined weight of the building that crushed the lower floors and caused it to collapse.

Please explain how a plane that has two very large titanium engines, left a 10ft hole in the Pentagon, with how much wreckage compared to other plane crashed (bodies, suitcases etc) And how one of the most secure areas in the world, has 1 crappy video of impact that shows nothing (I&#39;ll provide the other video later)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay sure.</p>

<p>When Flight 77 hit the Pentagon&#39;s exterior wall, it actually created a hole approximately 75 ft. wide. Unlike the WTC 1&amp;2, the Pentagon exterior wall was significantly made up of much more reinforced concrete and would leave an outline. The wings never made it through the first ring.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>compared to other plane crashes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No other plane crashed into a building designed to be as fortified as possible. The plane barely got past the second ring and many of the windows were even still intact. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It was absolutely a plane, and I&#39;ll tell you why. I saw the marks of the plane wing on the face of the building. I picked up parts of the plane with the airline markings on them. I held in my hand the tail section of the plane, and I found the black box. I held parts of uniforms from crew members in my hands, including body parts. Okay?</p>

<p>Yet no one else working there seems to know of a power loss over one day</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From his email - 
&quot;Scott Forbes, who was a senior database administrator for Fiduciary Trust, located on the 97th floor of the South Tower received a remarkable notice three weeks before the 9/11 attacks. The Port Authority of New York informed his company that there would be a “power down” on the weekend of Sept. 8 and 9, 2001. This would mean that all power would be off in the top half of the south tower for most of the weekend.</p>

<p>Forbes has called this unprecedented, because to have a data centre lose power for two days requires major preparations and disruption. He reports that as part of the power down, all security cameras and security door locks were non-operational for about 36 hours.&quot;
