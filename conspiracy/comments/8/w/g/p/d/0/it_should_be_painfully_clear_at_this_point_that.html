    <div class="md"><p>. If you&#39;re a little late to the party there. But it won&#39;t work. The fact is that works like MSNBC CNN Etc don&#39;t need you to watch their programs to make money. They&#39;re paid by the cable companies. Whenever you buy a cable package from say Time Warner Optimum excetera CNN is included in it</p>

<p>CNN gets paid even if you don&#39;t watch CNN. Because you&#39;re paying for the cable package. And there&#39;s no way to avoid it unless you stop buying Cable cable</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Responsible journalism, like responsible government, goes right out the window from the very moment people begin to uncritically accept and believe that they actually have or ever had such thing.</p>

<p>Next to selling soapflakes, the mass media does nothing quite as well as hyping and posturing and patting itself on the back about how honest, objective, and unbiased it&#39;s reporting is in a way that it never deserved and rarely, if ever, achieved on anything that was of major importance.</p>

<p>The mass media&#39;s control and influence over public opinion is established not by what it reports, but far more by what it chooses to NOT report on, because it gets to determine what&#39;s a priority or not and when it hasn&#39;t got that luxury by omitting critical details that can completely change the complexion and context of the stories they have no choice but to follow and publicly report on in order to appear to be doing a &quot;responsible&quot; and reliable job of that.</p>

<p>The advent of the internet where the ordinary people that not only witness major events but can now freely report what they know about them without that being ignored or filtered by the media to protect any number of vested interests of their own has dramatically changed all that. </p>

<p>Moreover, the internet has provided the means to disseminate all kinds of inconvenient and uncontestable facts about any number of historical events that clash with the official narratives that were provided for them.</p>

<p>The assassinations of JFK, MLK and RFK are only &quot;conspiracies&quot; because the media was clearly less than interested in what the truth about them genuinely was or in allowing the public to ever find it out. The events of 9/11, were yet another example.</p>

<p>The same thing can be said for the real reasons behind any number of US military interventions and the mas media&#39;s blind and willing acceptance and unabashed promotion of official excuses for them that quite simply don&#39;t add-up or stand-up to any real scrutiny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes out the window when the journalists realize that they can take sides and push a narrative.</p>

<p>When a political party is able to actually take control of entire news organizations organizations</p>

<p>The United States is long overdue for a law requiring news to tell the truth</p>

<p>And for all the people screaming about Free Press. You don&#39;t have Free Press already.</p>

<p>And even if you did. If allowing the news to lie is a direct threat to Americans freedom and free elections  f*** the news news</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s glaringly obvious that there&#39;s a new facet to the revolving door we learned about as children. It used to be industry, lobbyists, politicians. It clearly expanded to include political commentator now as well.</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but with the way the media has been working in my lifetime, I&#39;m certain we&#39;ll have a full blown fascist corporatist government before I check out. It&#39;s especially easy to see when you realize both sides are pretending &quot;liberals&quot; and socialism is the clear trend into the future when nothing could be farther from the truth when CEOs are literally heads of government departments and the people that wrote policies in the previous administration are given free reign to write the policies of this one as well.</p>
