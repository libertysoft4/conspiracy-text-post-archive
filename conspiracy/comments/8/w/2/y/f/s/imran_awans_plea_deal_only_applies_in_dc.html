    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Federal Court system, but you don&#39;t get to just pick one and go to that Courthouse. That&#39;s not how it works. I&#39;m not going to give you a lesson on all the stuff that goes into venue selection but you&#39;re just wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the government must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was committed. The court must set the place of trial within the district with due regard for the convenience of the defendant, any victim, and the witnesses, and the prompt administration of justice.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s what you&#39;re arguing, prove that&#39;s what he was doing? It&#39;s moot though, you can&#39;t bring the same charges federally as this case has already been decided. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha well I&#39;m not a lawyer and I doubt you are either. So it&#39;s moot for us to argue over this. </p>

<p>What is clear, according to the quote on page 10 in his plea deal in the OP, is that no other federal prosecutors outside of D.C. are bound by this. If they find enough to bring charges, they can. And I think that is what will happen.</p>

<p>Federal Courts can&#39;t hear every Federal case. It has to relate to their district. Or do you have something that actually shows otherwise? I&#39;ve given you statements from an advocacy group, one of the offices, and the actual law, you&#39;ve shown a story you didn&#39;t even get right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol.  Anons posted those pictures.  Q just referenced them.  </p>

<p>It appears that Trump took a picture of Q, and Q posted the reflection from his/her phone.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That photo was fake. You can easily tell it was from Obama&#39;s desk in 2015. Just read the great awakening thread and you can see all of them wondering why Q would post a faked photo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1675 he posts the fake picture. </p>

<p>1677 he comments on the anons calling him out and seems to try to say they distorted his image. </p>

<p>1678 Q says the things on Obama&#39;s desk and Trumps were nearly identical, minus a couple things, then insinuates he had moved stuff around. </p>

<p>Hes only on post 1681 today, all you gotta do is scroll down like half a second to see what he did last night. </p>

<p>This is what Q said:  </p>

<p>&quot;Who would have thought the &#39;Twitter&#39; phone could be so useful.<br/>
Do &#39;reflections&#39; violate NAT SEC rules?<br/>
