If they tried censoring and it wasn’t enough, and they tried bots and shills and everything else, but the masses just kept waking up, would they themselves push the #deletefacebook campaign? Sink the world’s largest media sharing site in order to slow down information spread? And do it making it look like some organic resistance to data mining??? They know there is no alternative as big, and it would work. It wouldn’t STOP information flow, but it would sure take a huge bite.</p>

<p>A thought I&#39;ve had, is that there are two &quot;competing&quot; Illuminati. The oil and oligarchical elite, vs the new, young tech elite.  Data is the new oil and I think the&quot;Old TPTB&quot; maybe realized that the Tech Elite is literally wiping them out, and this could be the surface machinations of that war?  Who thought a young 30 something dude would get to the world power of the 1% so fast.  They must have been thrown off by him, UNLESS, he, and the tech elite se, again, just another play in Their game of 4D chess.  I wish I could tell these things apart!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, since everyone is probably doing what they&#39;re doing, in terms of privacy concerns, why are they being sacrificed like this?  Just because we have enough evidence now?  I think the suspicion from OP is about why FB seemingly out of nowhere has hit this decline.  Obviously people have been talking an it this, but the past few weeks have been devastating. Maybe it&#39;s just a mark of the times and how fast information is spread, consumed, and taken into action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remembering when FB first came out. My first thought was,&quot; Ok, this is Myspace for college kids.&quot; FB was a little exclusive(open to college/alumni only). Everyone knew it was still the current flavor of a rehashed idea. Dumping FB for privacy concerns sounds smarter than leaving because it isn&#39;t trendy.  Maybe I am wrong but people under 30 are not flocking to FB. They still all have twitter and instagram though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. </p>

<p>There is a battle at the top among the elite, and we won&#39;t know what&#39;s at stake and what is really going on. We&#39;ve got very powerful folks such as that weinstein guy from hollywood, and strauss-kahn from the IMF who were taken down recently, and publicly humiliated with the help of the main stream press from all over the world. These 2 guys did something not to the taste of others among the elite, or to push an agenda. Note that these guys are all part of the same community. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a battle among the elite. Zuckerberg may be taken down next together with his facebook thing, for a reason we won&#39;t know about. They will make another zuckerberg to replace him. He will be promoted as a genius kid who built a billion dollar, working alone in his dorm room, with nothing other than a $500 laptop. Or some fairy tale like that. That new guy will also be part of the &quot;community&quot;. That new platform will allow greater control of the populace. With facebook as it is, things are getting out of control to the elite&#39;s taste. &quot;fake news&quot;, or we should say : alt news, are spreading too fast and too wide.</p>

<p>At Davos, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/25/george-soros-bashes-facebook-and-google-at-davos.html">George Soros told the world</a> that companies like Google and Facebook are being used to manipulate elections (that&#39;s what he used them for), and he made a call out to his allies in the EU saying that Facebook and Google should be regulated to death to make room for a new EU competitor which he intends to make into a new global platform for doing essentially the same thing, but outside of US jurisdiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess so, which is interesting. But it&#39;s important to understand that the deep state isn&#39;t completely homogenous. There are enclaves with dueling goals. The deep state doesn&#39;t have one single goal. There may be agencies who are much opposed to the attack on FB, and there probably are.</p>

<p>FB is seen as left-oriented, so if anyone&#39;s attacking it, it would be from a conservative corner of the deep state. In the fact the deep state is probably more neoconservative than anything, so it shouldn&#39;t be a surprise. What should be a surprise is that the leftists think the deep state is on their side. And that may be part of the whole plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm...not sure you&#39;re aware of this, but conservatives have been getting banned, shadow banned and de-monetized on Facebook since the elections, but it really got hot and heavy this year...to the point where really well-known people are complaining about it and moving to other platforms.</p>

<p>The likely effect of this will be loss of revenue due to loss of page views for Ads.  Zuck knew they were doing this, and I think this is why he&#39;s been selling because the de-platforming has been an orchestrated campaign.</p>

<p>As far as Zuck is concerned, I think he believed he was falling on his sword for the leftist cause, but now he&#39;s no longer useful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Under this logic, absolutely everything could be a psyop. </p>

<p>Facebook and social media is too large of a asset to them, in my opinion. Unless they&#39;re offering some sort of alternative, the lost users to facebook would just be going to other sites where the information isn&#39;t easily accessible. Just some thoughts. If I were to see a new social media platform being pushed as &quot;safe and secure&quot; and had funding from board members of Facebook or some other weird conflict i&#39;d buy into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the 16 elections and net neutrality debucle. The direction seems to privatise and regulate the internet. Basically ruining the great thing we have, like tv and radio. Next they will as they have now started to go after websites for criminal behaviour, adverts and controlling speech. Sensorship. Next will be a unification of social and real identities with a universal ID, that will link you social and govenrment sources into 1 got to account (school, health, tax, bank, social, entertaiments, everything). Perhaps even a sitizen score like china.  </p>

<p>There has never been a doubt that world would go paperless money,  and we will have an identity online linked with irl identity in the future. Its just getting there. This is coming. The trick is unifying nsa, google and other social platforms, the largest ones to do that. Linking all accounts into one place. Scary thing, google fb, etc they have your data, they have phones os and know so much about you. Personal emails, txts, files, everything, the government and corporations will have access to you, and will know you better than anyone you know...scary af. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zuck is getting too powerful and needs to be (and is getting) checked. FB is the only company that rivals the NSA in the amount of information they have on a global scale. With Zuck running for president and his large selling of stock, I&#39;d say he&#39;s been threatened and knew they were coming after him.  The moral here is that FB got too big and TPTB were threatened by cavalier Zuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remembering when FB first came out. My first thought was,&quot; Ok, this is Myspace for college kids.&quot; FB was a little exclusive(open to college/alumni only). Everyone knew it was still the current flavor of a rehashed idea. Dumping FB for privacy concerns sounds smarter than leaving because it isn&#39;t trendy.  Maybe I am wrong but people under 30 are not flocking to FB. They still all have twitter and instagram though.</p>
