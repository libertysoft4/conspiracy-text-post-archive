<p>A society of aggressive idiots is a society easily controlled and manipulated.  This is why TPTB keep us angry and ignorant.</p>

<p>Last thing they want is a peaceful, educated, intelligent citizenry - which we are all capable of being.  Everyone would wake up to the b.s. that is life on this prison planet and topple them in short order if that were the case and we all woke up to the manipulation.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That’s what people get taught in <del>indoctrination manuals</del> school books growing up.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5qJYwfAju8">The truth is significantly more complicated.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evolution is an emergent self-organized process that generates more complex and efficient forms, which happens faster in smallergroups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason it happens faster in smaller groups is because there is far less stability, so the smaller group <em>has</em> to adjust and evolve to its surroundings and circumstances as quickly as possible - like a small life raft in an ocean where it has to constantly adjust or be capsized and taken under in a matter of seconds.  Evolution doesn’t need to happen quickly in larger groups because it has <em>already</em> happened to a sufficient and successful enough extent to allow the group to get to that size in the first place - like a Supertanker that can stay at sea for literally generations with little to any difficulty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have lost intellectual and cultural identity and diversity as a result of groupthink and globalisation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You put the cart before the horse.  Cultural identity and diversity has been <del>lost</del> affected by the same nefarious elite mentioned above and their manipulation geared toward dumbing down and manipulating the masses.  No other reason.  Additionally, many have used “cultural identity and diversity” as an excuse to perpetuate racist ideologies.  <em>That</em> kind of “cultural identity and diversity” cannot be eradicated fast enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition, the global &quot;community&quot; fosters an out of sight out of mind mentality where people can freely walk around and use the products of slave labour in some other country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is visualizing global unity from the perspective of a PTB-constructed narrative.  Slave labor everywhere would be more easily done away with if everyone shared a foundation of core values.</p>

<p>You make the mistake of confusing dynamics.  You’re taking places that are currently controlled and undermined by TPTB and are using them as examples of why a <em>non</em>-PTB system “would never work.”  Saying “let’s see how that works out for you” and then referencing an example that has nothing to do with what I’m referring to and is in fact the very thing that the kind of global community I’m talking about would actually <em>do away</em> with shows that you in fact don’t understand a single thing I’m talking about.</p>

<p>This is like taking a Ford F150 and using it as “proof” of why an electric car “would never work and is simply impossible.”</p>

<p>It would work out pretty well actually.  Quite simple.  I’d just hop in a Tesla and leave your gas-guzzling vehicle in the dust.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to fix it from the bottom up not top down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is exactly what I’ve been referring to, but you keep ignoring it.  Why is that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you cant fix it by joining forces with the slave drivers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody ever said anything about joining forces with the slave drivers.  This is the very thing that I’m advocating AGAINST.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The dumbing down of the masses happens naturally</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite incorrect.  It’s happened in this civilization, but it hasn’t by <em>any</em> means whatsoever occurred “naturally”.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44I3pMouCnM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=1m1s">You couldn’t be any further from the truth, as a matter of fact.</a></p>

<p>There’s <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=edward+bernays&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=vid&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0obih4IraAhUH5oMKHYFyB0sQ_AUICigB&amp;amp;biw=1488&amp;amp;bih=688">much more if you wish to investigate further.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>for the same reason evolution &quot;doesnt have to be as fast&quot; in large groups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason evolution doesn’t have to be fast in large groups is because, as I said above, in large groups, a successful collective methodology has <em>already</em> been established.  That successful m.o. is in no way whatsoever necessarily linked to “the dumbing down of the masses”.  It as a matter of fact can be shown to be linked to an <em>evolving</em> of the masses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what racist ideologies are perpetuated by allowing people to interact with those of their choosing rather than enforcing &quot;tolerance&quot; upon people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sigh.  You continue twisting and misinterpreting what was said.  One wonders if you’re doing it on purpose to fit whatever it is you want to believe.  Thinking tolerance should be enforced is about as far from what I said as one can get.</p>

<p>If a group is intolerant of others to the extent that they have racist ideologies and they use that ignorant, closed-minded mindset to damage other groups, however, then those types of groups and that type of comportment should in fact be moved away from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By extension, tolerating something implies that you are being forced and dont actually agree with the thing being tolerated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This comment seems to advocate for a “do whatever you want” approach.  <em>“Yeah!  Anybody who tries to limit you and make you do something you don’t want is part of the problem!”</em></p>

<p>While that approach might appear desirable on a surface level, the fact of the matter is that it leaves open the possibility for a significant level of irresponsibility and ultimately utter disaster.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Don’t want to eat healthy, learn properly, be taught concepts of responsibility and good will?  Hey!  No problem!  Do whatever you want, buddy!&quot;</em></p>

<p>Okay.  Let everyone do whatever it is they want with no responsibility.  Let’s see how that works out for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, i do not wish to contribute to slavery so i avoid Chinese or other slave labour country produced goods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I personally do not wish to contribute to slavery or harm to other beings and other forms of life whether they be human or non-human, so not only do I avoid Chinese or other slave labour country-produced goods, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/869p0u/whats_your_option_on_the_vegan_diet/dw3fs4a/?context=3">but also…</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>give me a TLDW for that UFO channel video. The audio is fucked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing wrong with the audio in the video.  Your speakers perhaps are what’s “fucked”.  Here.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWbHK7s72bI">Try another version of the same lecture.</a> See if the audio in that “UFO channel is fucked” too.</p>

<p>And nice attempt at unnecessary marginalization.  Why am I not surprised that you couldn’t keep yourself from that type of closed-minded thinking? Smh</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It was just an analogy as it regards “the internal combustion engine as representative of civilizational inefficiency”.  Switch out the F150 with literally any other gas burning car.  Analogy’s the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By naturally i meant that &quot;it naturally follows from&quot; since it is a self organizing emergent phenomenon, like a cellular automaton.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that this is how I related to the comment as well, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And cellular automata theory, emergence and self organization are why evolution happens at different rates depending on selection pressure and group size.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not the full story, however, for natural selection and Darwinian evolution is by no means the only process through which species come to be and evolve.  As such, cellular automata theory, emergence, and self organization are ultimately not sufficient to account for what we’ve been discussing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Too much homogeniety leads to an inability to adapt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Homogeniety by definition and by its very nature accommodates the whole - i.e. it’s an aggregate, which means it’s not only adapted to the environment within which it finds itself, but would do so to wherever else it might end up.</p>

<p>That said…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which is why i think having distinct cultures and ideologies is beneficial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think there is anything wrong with different cultures, ideologies, and perspectives, nor did I say anything to this effect in anything we’ve discussed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My issue with tolerance, in the context of forced interactions, is that if people dont like each other and have incompatible cultures, they can simply remain separate without damaging each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve never talked about forced interactions, however.  That has never been a component of what I’ve mentioned.  I don’t disagree that there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with individuals who might prefer to remain separate.  Whoever wishes to remain separate - so long as they don’t engage in practices that might injure the whole - can do so.</p>

<p>Again, not now nor did I ever advocate for any type of “forced interactions”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take the UK, Germany and Sweden as examples of forced mixing destroying countries and cultures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you commit what is called a False Cause Fallacy.  If anything is destroying those countries, it’s the same influences forcing people out of their countries through war and strife - not the people themselves who are fleeing an environment of war, persecution, and poverty ultimately caused by said forces.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>can you give me a few sentence synopsis of what specifically that video had to do with evolution?</p>

<p>We’ve been lied to about our genome, what it means, and what it shows about how we came to exist and who we really are as a species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. Currently, electric cars have limited range and arent always charged with renewable energy sources. Your Tesla may be powered by coal or nuclear power, depending on where you charge it. And the mining for the materials that go into batteries, and the disposal of the batteries pose environmental problems. Its not as simple as electric equals good, ICE equals bad at all. And not all ICE powered cars are equal. I have literally one of the most thermally efficient cars you can buy, and overall thermal efficiency is the key to environmental friendliness until we are all solar or wind powered.</p>

<p>How are cellular automata theory, self organized criticality etc insufficient? What else is operating to make evolution happen beyond those processes which include the selection of genes within the phase space of an organism or ecosystem? </p>

<p>Homogeneity means that one illness or change that a species isnt adapted to can make it extinct. I suggest checking your logical premises. True diversity allows for catastrophes to be contained, rather than spread through a homogeneous system.</p>

<p>They arent fleeing as refugees to a safe harbour country, then returning once their home has stabilized. They are colonizing it and creating no go zones all over Europe. Would you like some videos on that?

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I&#39;m more of an optimist, but I think being connected to each other via the information highway (internet) has led to a more aware citizenry. Being connected to people on different continents helps us understand that there is no &quot;other&quot; to hate. It then becomes more difficult to draw people into endless wars. This is one example of many. The internet becomes a collective consciousness from which to draw truths that were previously hidden from us. It&#39;s not as good as the consciousness that we can tap into if we were to just meditate and go within... but it&#39;s still valuable.</p>

<p>With that said, we shouldn&#39;t lose connection to our immediate neighbors either. Most of our innate power comes from how we affect those in our immediate vicinity and for most people, that happens in the real world and not online. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Concorde and Space Shuttle were both flawed systems. I get your point of lost glory ages, but I disagree.</p>

<p>The western world certainly doesn&#39;t produce as much bulk, cheap goods anymore, it&#39;s simply not economically viable anymore. But to say that there is no production of high-quality goods is flat-out wrong in my experience.</p>

<p>The entire world buys Boeings and Airbuses, they&#39;re not supersonic, but that&#39;s not for a lack of trying, but rather for a lack of economic viability of those systems.</p>

<p>The same applies to the Space Shuttle. It was great in its time, but was always a massively expensive system to use. I agree that we shouldn&#39;t be dependent on Russians for our space launches, but let&#39;s not pretend we&#39;re behind countries like Russia and China when it comes to space. SpaceX is a great example, because it not only pushes the envelope with what&#39;s possible in space technology, but does so while being economically viable at the same time.</p>

And I do understand that when looking at the situation through certain perspectives, such as the declining blue collar industries. But to say that the west has lost its pace in the modern global economy is not true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lack of &quot;bulk cheap goods&quot; underpins a massive economic problem.</p>

<p>Between selling our manufacturing capability to slave labour communist shitholes like China and the automation coming, its becoming not economically viable for people to have children and a family with an actual future unless theyre part of the rich ruling class or so poor, illegal or &quot;minority&quot;(even though whites are becoming the minority in the west) that they can pop out kids and get welfare checks.</p>

<p>Those jobs that went to Chinese or other slave labour around the world actually benefitted those who needed them or were starting out. Now you have tent cities of homeless in California like some third world shithole, while miles away the most expensive house in the US is being built for $250M. </p>

<p>The gap between rich and poor that the socialists who infected our government created is getting wider because of them.</p>

<p>Its not pessimism, its realism to say that just about everything that most people buy says Made in China on it and comes from some shit company like Amazon or Walmart.</p>

<p>And realistically, SLS is a bunch of shit compared to the Shuttle.</p>

<p>As for the engineering of the Shuttle and Concorde, they still surpass what is flying today... You do realize that both Shuttle accidents were human judgement related right? The original ET foam never fell off and damaged the Orbiter. That happened after theyd been flying for 22 years. People said it was too cold to launch 51L. I know people who worked on it and the recovery and return to flight.</p>

<p>Concorde wasn&#39;t flawed. It was overloaded at takeoff, had a tire blowout(of which it had had 57 total with no other issues), was going too slow for the attempted emergency manouver attempted, and had just hit a runway landing light which the engine ate.</p>

<p>It veered into the light because the maintenece crew didnt put a safety critical spacer on the landing gear(it was found in the hangar after the crash).</p>

<p>Once again, the design can be superb but people can fuck it up through negligence or incompetence.</p>

<p>Next youll be saying the Veyron was a bad design because some guy drove it into a lake?</p>

<p>With Mass Communication our way of thinking changes automatically. The Media companies are not selling Ads anymore (they still do though) but Ideas and Feelings.</p>

<p>Having been sold a feeling is so much more powerful and valuable in the long run. The only way against it is to not be emotional when it comes to news. Get yourself boring news. News that dont make you feel angry, confirmed or happy. Instead of reading the Science headlines, read the original Papers. If you cant understand them, buy books, learn and make yourself understand. Same goes for political news. Get neutral sources, and if its too deep to grasp yet...Dig Down until you do.</p>

<p>Do that long enough and you become Immune to manipulating &quot;news&quot; and Populism....It makes you a &quot;weirdo&quot; though, in the eyes of most folks. So i guess pick your poison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a certain argument to be had here, yes.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the invention of the lock. The lock was invented as a necessity as communities in the medieval period started growing too large for people to know one another personally.</p>

<p>The trust-based system failed when people didn&#39;t feel like they were robbing their neighbors and friends, but strangers sharing the same town. A certain sense of personality was lost.</p>

<p>To this day the crime rates around the world are massively higher in larger cities than rural communities, largely for this exact reason. Now it&#39;s quite easy nowadays to commit your crimes in the next town over so no integrated community is entirely safe, but the correlation still exists.</p>

<p>I think a similar argument could be made for other aspects of human behavior. Human minds are constructed to function well within a small group of close allies, effectively a tribe.</p>

<p>This predisposition combined with a lack of time is why most people only consider themselves having a handful of actual friends in combination with a much larger group of acquaintances.</p>

<p>The use of social media to me is not as much an extension of one&#39;s social sphere, because that is practically already saturated by the time one creates an account, but more of a dopamine game which just happens to involve the opinions of other people.</p>

<p>To say its addictive is accurate, I see the same effect here on Reddit. But at least on Reddit people don&#39;t pretend to be each other&#39;s friends, and therefore are much less invested in the opinions and behavior of other users.</p>

<p>To extrapolate this line to the point of idiocracy is a bridge too far in my opinion though. Sure, people waste a lot of time and resources with what is essentially pointless browsing on social media, but I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s damaging to the majority of those.</p>

<p>There are certainly addicts, and that&#39;s certainly a problem, but percentage-wise that&#39;s still a very small number of people in my experience. Most people are well capable of handling real life and social media and don&#39;t get &#39;lost&#39; in the game.</p>

<p>I will admit that I&#39;m optimistic about many situations, but humans are adaptive, and as long as we have more important things to do and more important people to actually engage with, we don&#39;t lose ourselves that easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in a village, a <em>literal</em> village established in the 1760s. I&#39;ve been here for over forty years, and my family has been here for five generations, six if you count my kids. The stories that my grandmother and great-grandmother have told me about this place and the people in it indicate more change than not. </p>

<p>It used to be a fairly self-sufficient place, you could get what you needed right here up until about WWII when it started to shift to a bedroom community. Now, you have to drive to the Kohls-Target-Petsmart complex four miles away to purchase the exact same consumables as the rest of America. The character of the place has been mostly gutted by cultural homogenization.</p>

<p>Maybe someone from an urban area would look at this village and see it as epitomizing that quaint, friendly, small town feel. All outward appearances would lead one to believe that...but in my experience, that is an inauthentic impression designed to drain people&#39;s wallets. Supervisors are more concerned with economic development than sustainability which has led to ticky-tacky McMansion suburban developments encircling the village. It has really drained the place of any unique character. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People can handle ideas from a lot more people than that though.  Our brains didn&#39;t explode if we browsed through books from more than 150 people.  The problem is attaching faces and photos to it and believing that we know someone.  Its particularly bad with women because they tend to focus more on relations than ideas compared to men and so many of them need to be feel like someone is a someone by their social media presence.  I&#39;ve noticed especially in developing countries that it confuses them because its all about connecting in to that perceived rich and sexy Western created culture of success.  Then you don&#39;t have an account and they don&#39;t know what to make of it other than typically that you aren&#39;t quite whom you are supposed to be.  Fine then, I&#39;ll reactive my account for the love of females but then they just up the shit to 11 by requiring me to literally submit my passport scan to verify that I&#39;m who I say that I am.  Sorry but I&#39;m not one of these unflattering descriptions used by the Zuck.  In the West there are more people whom are coming out of the other side of it disillusioned and then of course what is packaged into that is cynicism and regret.  There is something that happens quite simply when you don&#39;t have Facebook and its equivalents is that less things will happen for you socially.  People will have parties and put the invite out over Facebook, girls will want things to just happen magically socially without a concentrated official effort on their part and so you will end up accidentally less with a drunk woman at 3am.  Oops, how did that happen.  Less dating, less &quot;hey I like you&quot; and more &quot;oops, guess that happened&quot; .  Well enough people show up to private parties and that is said to be a success but I call it a dismal social disaster.  We&#39;ve allowed people to centralize our culture and to spy on us.  We linger around social places less and this is said to be more efficient because we can just message the people whom we want to meet but then that is thrown right out the window because we pay for that 5x by always needing to check our status and respond to people in short time.  Its not a time saver and its not socially beneficial.  It is however the vortex that most everything has been sucked into and so its largely all that remains.  Everything is sex.   According to mythology even Facebook wasn&#39;t finished until their was a relationship status field.  So you met a woman?  Great!  Well to make that happen you probably need Facebook unless you are in a fairly rare subculture that is going the other way.  Again, probably because they are disillusioned, wiser and with some scars for the wear.   Try pulling out that cheap Nokia <em>actual phone</em> to communicate and see the gasps.  Give an email that would otherwise be a Facebook account but isn&#39;t because you don&#39;t use it.  Then you know how it works.  The sexual market doesn&#39;t understand out-of-band CPUs that are connected to cellular modems and DMA (direct memory access) to your phone with countless binary blobs scattered across firmware, drivers and OS.  That is putting it lightly.  That is why things are the way that they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well no. The thing is, is that we don&#39;t have the technology to efficiently travel throughout the world. It costs quite a bit of money to travel, especially if you&#39;re in certain parts of the world like the Americas. Not to mention hotel stay and all these other things.</p>

<p>So while it is great that people can communicate with people from all over the world, it&#39;s not the same as face-to-face interaction. I think to achieve that, we need to step up technology and build a more egalitarian society. Otherwise, there is that melancholy, wanton feeling because everything is so out of reach.</p>

<p>Still, I appreciate the ability to connect to others. I don&#39;t regret my interactions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re just looking at it slightly askew:</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that we were never meant to be, rather that we&#39;re just not equipped mentally at this infantile stage of the world wide web we&#39;re creating. It&#39;s going to take time to harness its full capabilities.</p>

<p>Might as well ask &quot;Were we meant to live in houses in one place instead of roam?&quot; when we first started doing that. </p>

<p>Or &quot;Were we meant to fly in the air instead of staying firmly on the ground?&quot; when the Wright brothers first figured it out. </p>

<p>An answer in each case in a way could be &quot;no&quot; because our accomplishments as a species aren&#39;t predetermined by meaning, rather by unavoidability. </p>

<p>We&#39;re still in the very beginning of it, from a global perspective the Internet is barely reaching 30 years old and humans are having to go through all kinds of quick changes that we&#39;re just not ready for, but doing our best (as a whole). </p>

<p>If you look at the statistics of global health, disease, sickness, poverty, life expectancy, material availability we are today so much better off than mere decades ago, and drastically better compared to the centuries before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in a village, a <em>literal</em> village established in the 1760s. I&#39;ve been here for over forty years, and my family has been here for five generations, six if you count my kids. The stories that my grandmother and great-grandmother have told me about this place and the people in it indicate more change than not. </p>

<p>It used to be a fairly self-sufficient place, you could get what you needed right here up until about WWII when it started to shift to a bedroom community. Now, you have to drive to the Kohls-Target-Petsmart complex four miles away to purchase the exact same consumables as the rest of America. The character of the place has been mostly gutted by cultural homogenization.</p>

<p>Maybe someone from an urban area would look at this village and see it as epitomizing that quaint, friendly, small town feel. All outward appearances would lead one to believe that...but in my experience, that is an inauthentic impression designed to drain people&#39;s wallets. Supervisors are more concerned with economic development than sustainability which has led to ticky-tacky McMansion suburban developments encircling the village. It has really drained the place of any unique character. </p>
