    <div class="md"><p>What the hell is he referring to in this quote? He specifically says (from the article) that he heard about the shooting and went to the school to video because this “couldn’t be another school shooting”. Did he forget that he was supposed to be at the school during the shooting and trapped in a closet getting interviews from scared classmates? Also, why wasn’t he in school that day if this quote stands true? Can anyone dig up footage of him on tape actually saying this? Or at least another quote saying the same thing? This could get <em>really</em> interesting....</p>

<p>He&#39;s recounting the event of him riding his bike towards the school. He did it once in February, and again in this newest interview. Just because he doesn&#39;t say 6PM in the new interview doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t ride his bike at 6PM.</p>

<p>Seems it&#39;s implied through context on a different interview that he returns in the evening after the shooting, as opposed to breaking in while the shooting is occurring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CBS interview has the quote everyone is pushing, but it lacks some sense of context in relation to time. Most other interviews relating to this add the context of time for the bike ride part that proves he wasn&#39;t there, that is what I mean.</p>

<p>Second interview/article states it was evening too:<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/03/on-the-ground-with-parkland-teens-as-they-plot-a-revolution.html">http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/03/on-the-ground-with-parkland-teens-as-they-plot-a-revolution.html</a></p>

<p>If he had said &quot;I was at home the whole day and went to school in the evening&quot;, that would be a more plausible smoking gun. But without the time frame of when he left home on the original quote, wouldn&#39;t hold much water in regards to saying &quot;he definitely wasn&#39;t at school&quot;. </p>
