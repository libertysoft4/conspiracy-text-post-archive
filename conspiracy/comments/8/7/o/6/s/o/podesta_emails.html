Sure, there are people out there who believe and see things as they are- but the vast majority of people could care less, and have bought the story hook, line, and sinker. Most have no idea about the true corruption of the DNC or Podesta, or the rigging of the Primaries. Most people don&#39;t pay attention...and when they do, its 5 minutes of CNN or Fox here or there...and they gobble the programming right up. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence of that. That was a claim made by <a href="http://victuruslibertas.com/2016/11/do-john-and-tony-podesta-have-a-connection-with-missing-child-madeleine-mccann/">Victurus Libertas</a>, who simply lifted the text of an earlier <a href="https://www.infowars.com/the-eu-a-powerhouse-pedophile-hierarchy/">Inforwars story by Wayne Madsen</a> about paedophilia in the EU and added some made-up bit about the Podestas being in Portugal. Note that VL quotes Madsen&#39;s line &quot;Of greater interest is that fact that Freud owned a villa in Praia da Luz&quot; but attributes it to an &quot;FBI insider&quot; to make it sound more credible. The claim was <a href="https://steemit.com/politics/@tlavagabond/the-podesta-brothers-revealed-to-be-in-portugal-the-day-of-madeleine-mccann-s-disappearance">later repeated</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She was said never to turn on the heat or use hot water. She wore one old black dress and undergarments that she changed only after they had been worn out, did not wash her hands and rode in an old carriage. She ate mostly pies that cost fifteen cents. One tale claims that Green spent half a night searching her carriage for a lost stamp worth two cents. Another asserts that she instructed her laundress to wash only the dirtiest parts of her dresses (the hems) to save money on soap.</p>

<p>“The memo says: “We need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to Isis and other radical groups in the region.”  </p>

<p>So not explicitly weapons, but financial and logistical support (I’ve gotta assume financial support would lead to the purchase of weapons, among other things).

    <div class="md"><p>The whole internet was set ablaze for a good couple of weeks when these emails dropped. Just look at the sheer amount of traffic reddit and the chans were getting. Look at the sudden shut downs of every thread/subreddit/board that was discussing them. Look at when they finally played the &#39;fake news&#39; card that they&#39;d been holding on to for years. Fake news had honestly been a widespread problem for years in places like Facebook, but they held onto the &#39;fake news&#39; card until they had something to shut down. Just look at Google trends for Podesta/Fake News or Pizzagate/Fake News. 
Look at how quickly Twitter started hiding the trending hashtags on the matter, as well as admitting to hiding at least half or the posts. Look at how heavily communities were flooded with shills and spooks during this time, and how any mouthpiece was equally shut down. Assange disappeared from a room he&#39;s been shut in for years for releasing these emails. They even committed Kanye West because he was vocal about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One reason might be that there isn’t a person in the world who knows what they are talking about that will say DKIM is an acceptable verifier of an email senders identity and it would actually be very easy for an Intelligence agency or anyone with serious computing power to spoof a few fake ones to sprinkle in with the real ones. Why didn’t Podesta and company make an effort to point this out? They could have said they were fake and nobody could contradict them really, so why wouldn’t you if you were being accused of something so heinous? Then you look at the fantastically convenient circumstances surrounding the emails including the timing as a distraction from Hillary’s missing 33k emails, Podestas weak password, losing his phone in a cab, etc...combined with the very odd method of delivery by Wikileaks, breaking it all down into bite sized pieces and spoon-feeding them to us via the Stochastic Terminator algorithm, breaking a rock solid pattern of behavior up until that point by releasing everything via bulk dump, and alarm bells should be going off in your head. </p>

<p>If that’s not enough we have ex-spymaster Michael Flynn, an expert in psychological warfare and subversion, leading the p-gate push alongside his son on Twitter. The same Michael Flynn photographed repeatedly with Admiral Rogers at Nowruz Commission galas, the same Rogers who heads the NSA which Fancy Bear tools can be traced back to. The NSA being a Pentagon controlled operation, who have obvious motive to want to humiliate Clinton due to Benghazi etc... I could go on and on, there are so many problems and red flags here. </p>

<p>Could Podesta be a pedo and the code words actually be referencing drugs, and the fake emails are just misdirection with the hopes that the media “fake news” onslaught will discredit and embarrass anyone trying to dig deeper? Of course that is a possibility, especially since it seems that pizza parlors being used as fronts for cocaine distribution have a long and storied history, just like the CIA and cocaine, as well as rumors about the Clintons and cocaine use/distribution.</p>

<p>If you stop and think about it, do your own research, and reconcile the contradictions together you can actually eliminate a lot of possibilities. Personally, I think the appearance of Frank Giustra of Uranium One fame alongside a FBI pedo doc logo for his charity is a giant red flag. That plus the infamous photo of Podesta with the fish and number 14 on his hands leading back to Russia is further indication that it was a “fake news” credibility trap.</p>

<p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2016/11/03/podestas-think-tank-took-millions-from-a-nonprofit-with-russian-ties/">https://dailycaller.com/2016/11/03/podestas-think-tank-took-millions-from-a-nonprofit-with-russian-ties/</a></p>

<p>Researching Flynn leads me to the conclusion that his contentious relationship with the FBI is just as likely theatrics as anything else and could actually be working with the FBI to coordinate the Russia misdirection.  In fact, the Strzok/Page “insurance plan” could just as likely be the ‘holy shit, we convinced the country one half are Satanic cannibals and the other half are Kremlin operatives but we can’t deliver on either of those things so we need a back door to escape plan’ plan. Flynn contracted quite a few ex-FBI agents to do work for Flynn Intel Group and even had his good friend Brian McCauley get promoted to a high ranking position in the FBI by Mueller when both were there. It seems it is common for these govt. intel agents to leave for the higher paying private field and maintain good working relationships with each other, regardless of working for different agencies, for just that reason. Strange how easily Flynn was caught in the wiretap sting don’t you think? It’s like the spymaster totally forgot everything he knew about opsec, and then totally forgot he was a tough guy General and folded under the slightest media pressure. People like to say he was fired, but that isn’t how it went down. The initial news story broke, Trump issued that statement of support, Flynn held the news conference where he said he was stepping down, and THEN the Trump administration said that he was actually fired. Quite the discrepancy. That was the last thing Trump needed at the time too, you would think Flynn would be smart enough to know that and handle it differently.</p>

<p>Anyways, lots of problems here.</p>

<p>Example of anyone qualified to speak on the matter saying it can’t be done please. The limitation at the time of the initial Google server flaw discovery was processing power, that was years ago. Anyways, this guy has testified before Senate Committees etc. and was even called on by Google as an expert witness in their Oracle battle, he specializes in the mechanics of email  blah, blah, blah. He says it’s a myth that DKIM can be used to verify the senders identity. Browsing StackOverflow I found the same consensus. If you can point me at a qualified person saying it is a legit verifier like PGP, then by all means wow me with your mastery of search engines. </p>

<p>Seeing as how it took about two minutes to find this why didn’t anyone from the Podesta-Clinton camp do the same basic research? An expert on the matter debunking it seems like good ammo to me and you would think they would do anything they can to debunk it whether guilty or innocent.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They weren&#39;t exactly crazy, it was mostly things we expected for years.  Now we have the direct words of people in the Clinton campaign, showing their true sentiments that were blatantly obvious all along.</p>

<p>Basically it comes down to the Clinton political dynasty&#39;s influence over the press, and many of the ruling class not wanting their own words leaked to the world.  That&#39;s why the vast majority of Republican politicians and power players are reticent as well, because they don&#39;t want the same thing to happen to them.  Therefore, since the press are straight up propaganda outlets, none of them want you to see or hear anything on the matter, and try to keep the conversation in a narrow spectrum of scientifically tested talking points.</p>

<p>Also, your assesment that Podesta-Delonge connetion is a &quot;nothingburger&quot; is pretty much bs, since the mere fact of exposure of those emails caused Delonge, as admitted by himself, to make rounds doing interviews about his project. Notably, on the Joe Rogan, where he comes off as completely oblivious to how he is being manipulated, while listing all the possible intelligence manipulation strategies.    </p>

<p>The age of the account suggests throwaways, so its easy to make bs claims.</p>
