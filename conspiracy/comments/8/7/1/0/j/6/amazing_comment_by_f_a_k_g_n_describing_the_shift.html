        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s no question this sub&#39;s politics changes every now and then.</p>

<p>In the run up to the election, a large portion of the sub supported Donald Trump. That changed practically overnight in January 2017.</p>

<p>One way to see that is to look at average comment scores over time. Awhile ago, I did a comparison of the overlap between r/conspiracy and the_donald. I&#39;ve seen lots of people say this is &quot;TD 2.0&quot; so I thought it would be interesting to compare.</p>

<p>────────</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a chart showing the average submissions scores over time: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/gmEpN1q.png">https://i.imgur.com/gmEpN1q.png</a></p>

<p>The Index is the TD average minus the non-TD average.</p>

<p>There&#39;s not much that stands out. After the Republican primary, the average submission score of a &quot;TD user&quot; increased more than a &quot;non-TD user&quot;</p>

<p>────────</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the same thing but for comment scores: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/K16aXLL.png">https://i.imgur.com/K16aXLL.png</a></p>

<p>Average comment scores for Non-TD posters went up significantly after January 2017. Comments flipped from having a slight TD bias to having a slight Non-TD bias.</p>

<p>────────</p>

<p>I did the same thing for TMOR vs conspiracy. Here&#39;s the comment averages: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/rC3OJ3K.png">https://i.imgur.com/rC3OJ3K.png</a></p>

<p>────────</p>

<p>There&#39;s a handful of theories I think could explain why there has been a shift in the userbase, such as:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;TD users&quot; have left. Banned or just not interested anymore, I don&#39;t know why but the percent of TD users is now back to pre-2016 levels</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s an influx of new users who want to discuss conspiracies surrounding Russia and President Trump. That includes temporary surges like when a link is cross posted from r/politics.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase in links from meta subreddits like TMOR and their growing userbase. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xB0EoGk.png">https://i.imgur.com/xB0EoGk.png</a> </p></li>
</ol>

<p>────────</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in how I defined &quot;TD users&quot; and the (spaghetti) code I used, I have a post with more details here</p>

<p>If you see any mistakes or have constructive criticism, please let me know.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="/u/f_a_k_g_n">/u/f_a_k_g_n</a> for pitting this together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think when people say that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> 2.0, they&#39;re not just talking about the userbase, but the mod team, which is surprisingly pro-Trump. A lot of the tone of the sub can be traced back to the tone the mods set. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah I honestly think the user base kinda fits across the board but if you look at things like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>certain threads being put into contest mode</p></li>
<li><p>the dossier being tagged in away that dismissed it as conjecture</p></li>
<li><p>things like the Skripar post making an argument that it might not have been Russia being stickied for about a week</p></li>
<li><p>the use of the conclave to pick mods, establish than idea that certain regulars are  “core users of the sub” who just so happen to have similar beliefs</p></li>
<li><p>an ex-mod who got removed arguing for a “persona non grata” rule in said sub, with those lessons commuting the offense of being liberal and liking conspiracies</p></li>
<li><p>certain people getting more leeway regarding rule violations than others</p></li>
<li><p>mods making grandstanding posts of a political nature that promotes belief in certain conspiracies skepticism of certain other conspiracies</p></li>
</ul>

<p>you can see how people think the mod team on this sub wants to influence things a certain way. That being said the mod team has a difficult job, a lot of them are very fair, things like the SS rule have really cleaned up the sub. But, in my opinion, the mod team is not an agenda free place </p>

<p>their donald fetish is subsiding as they realize they&#39;ve been conned, possibly more so than other Americans. T_D is a frothing mess of second thoughts and regret. They are disillusioned as trump continues to shit all over everything. they, including donald himself, blame pelosi and &#39;the dems&#39; for the latest budget, when he personally signed the bill into law after his lame veto threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the same reason people get called out for visiting /politics: The culture in both of those subs thrives on echo-chambering. </p>

<p>There&#39;s likely a bit of history to it as well. TD leapt onto the scene as a highly motivated user-base that was brazenly good at manipulating the voting system (doing a pretty effective job of trolling the liberal-leaning users of reddit along the way), and when they started coming over here (the whole Flytape saga) this made some of the more politically neutral users here nervous that they would take over the sub. </p>

<p>These days, the /politics and TMoR crowds seem to be getting more brazen and effective here. Political conspiracies are thus increasingly framed in tribal, partisan terms, frustrating, I suspect, TD-leaning users and politics / TMoR users alike. </p>

<p>The sub is increasingly--almost exclusively, some would say--a backwater battleground for partisan manipulation and outrage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah I honestly think the user base kinda fits across the board but if you look at things like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>certain threads being put into contest mode</p></li>
<li><p>the dossier being tagged in away that dismissed it as conjecture</p></li>
<li><p>things like the Skripar post making an argument that it might not have been Russia being stickied for about a week</p></li>
<li><p>the use of the conclave to pick mods, establish than idea that certain regulars are  “core users of the sub” who just so happen to have similar beliefs</p></li>
<li><p>an ex-mod who got removed arguing for a “persona non grata” rule in said sub, with those lessons commuting the offense of being liberal and liking conspiracies</p></li>
<li><p>certain people getting more leeway regarding rule violations than others</p></li>
<li><p>mods making grandstanding posts of a political nature that promotes belief in certain conspiracies skepticism of certain other conspiracies</p></li>
</ul>

<p>you can see how people think the mod team on this sub wants to influence things a certain way. That being said the mod team has a difficult job, a lot of them are very fair, things like the SS rule have really cleaned up the sub. But, in my opinion, the mod team is not an agenda free place </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah</p>

<p>It&#39;s weird how people say this sub is T_D 2.0 yet anything critical of Obama, Hillary, Antifa, CNN, Soros, ShareBlue, Democrats, <a href="/r/politicd">/r/politicd</a> etc is downvote brigaded and attacked meanwhile any posts or comments critical of Trump/Russia/T_D etc are always upvoted. Even i this thread.</p>

<p>Seems odd how those &quot;Russian bots&quot; or &quot;T_D users/mods&quot; vote against their interests. Also odd how most top posts on this sub the past few months are crossposts from various <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> spam subs </p>
