        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A month ago there was an article in the WSJ&#39;s that discussed the US military was going to be shifting there focus from the Middle East to China &amp; Russia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/vSlrd#selection-1989.0-1993.91">U.S. Considers Boosting Asia Forces With Special Marine Units
Shift would promote new strategy emphasizing China and Russia, with cutbacks in the Mideast</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It continues on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Military officials said the MEUs are under consideration with other complementary proposals to reposition forces into East Asia to counter a rising China, which the new defense strategy identifies as <strong>undermining an international world order in place for decades</strong>. Officials said they didn’t know when a final decision would be made about deployments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initially I figured they were talking about the NWO in general, but yesterday I discovered <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-futures/china-plans-to-launch-crude-oil-futures-on-march-26-securities-regulator-idUSKBN1FT0P2">China is about to start their own Petro-Yuan that will compete against the Petro Dollar</a> and it launches tomorrow.  China is the largest purchaser of oil and will most likely be working with Russian, Syria &amp; Iran.  Not only that, but they are backing the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/petro-yuan-china-wants-to-dethrone-dollar-rmb-denominated-oil-contracts.html">Petro Yuan with Gold</a>, which both <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-china-and-russia-are-buying-so-much-gold-2016-08-01">Russia &amp; China</a> have been hoarding for the past decade +.  </p>

<p>We all know how it goes when countries try to go against the Petro Dollar, i.e Libya &amp; Iraq.  But this time, we have both Russia &amp; China who are also readying themselves.  Putin announced back in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vladimir-putin-russia-business-war-production-sochi-military-talks-a8069951.html">Nov 2017 for manufacturers to be War Ready</a>, while China recently added an additional <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/04/china-raises-2018-military-budget-by-8-point-1-percent.html">175 Billion to their Military Budget</a>.  This is in light of the US have a bloated military budget and recently having Neocon Bolton take the National Security Advisor position.  </p>

<p>Thought I’d give you guys a heads up, since this looks like it has potential to trigger WW3 and almost no one in the MSM news ever talks about the Petro Dollar or in this case the new Petro-Yuan.  Just some food for thought!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And tgat the whole other side of the story, the US has undermined our economy by not allowing us to feel the full effects of the 08 crash, not punishing those responsible, and floating our economy with Quantitative Easing.  I personally think the erosion of the middle class since the 90&#39;s, the waisted trillions on war based off of lies, and the destruction of civil liberties while creating a surveillance state has all been intentialy to turn us into China.  I think TPTB are playing it all, and perfer a Chinese type society where the general population are more controlled than here in the state.  The best way to bring that about it to bottom out pur economy and blame a foriegn entity so they don&#39;t have to answer for our policies over the 30+ years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah,  well its the end of the US empire as it was hoped to be by PNAC.     There will still be a sphere of US influence probably at least for a while just like there is a sphere of German influence,   a sphere of Russian influence.   But the US is 5% of the world population with a decreasing share of total world GDP relative to everywhere else.    Not only that,  but a lot of things like carbon based energy and unlimited pollution are coming to an end,  the US system of politics is certainly not worth adopting anywhere or worth exporting anywhere,  not if its based on a foreign policy like the US has had since the Spanish American War.    But it is already being copied by China who is now building military bases even in Africa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The house of cards has become too valuable to knock over. I feel as though China has put itself into a position to pry away power and there is no way to stop it without knocking over the entire house. They have almost engaged in economic bjj to the point where they have even bought out large portions of our western propaganda machine.  The western way of life would suffer without them, and they seem to be playing a more mechanized long game than countries that are considered more “free”. With algorithmic control (see the posts in china’s internal citizen ratings) the Chinese ptb have wedges themselves into a position of creeping control that we will see play outnover the next few decades imo.</p>
