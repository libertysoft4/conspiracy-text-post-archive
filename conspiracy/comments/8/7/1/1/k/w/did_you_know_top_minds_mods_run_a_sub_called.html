        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before <a href="/r/digital_manipulation">/r/digital_manipulation</a> went private some lovely person got an archive. Note the MOD team. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170912011148/reddit.com/r/digital_manipulation">https://web.archive.org/web/20170912011148/reddit.com/r/digital_manipulation</a>) here is an archive for proof ; * </p>

<p>This link in particular I believe I was led to:</p>

<p><a href="https://labs.rs/en/">https://labs.rs/en/</a></p>

<p>It is a webpage with several documents dedicated to online meta data and mining user information. This link mind you was posted by a MOD of tmor. If their sub is just about &quot;having fun and making jokes&quot; why would one of their mods be affiliated with a subreddit on online media manipulation?</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/871f2i/is_rmfn_a_time_traveler_top_mind_discovers_secret">https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/871f2i/is_rmfn_a_time_traveler_top_mind_discovers_secret</a></p>

<p>Ohh, triggered! I used my scrying mirror to see into your secret sub. I can actually hear your thoughts, tmor. Such is the power of the high King. I offered Phoenix a challenge to lyrically bout and arm wrestle to determine who is the true King. He has yet to respond to my offer. Fear? Why do you fear the mad King, pheephee?</p>

<p>&quot;The kicker is he summoned me to /CST, abusing his very own &#39;golden rule&#39; in the process, banned me, then some of them had the gall to message modmail in my super secret laboratory for access. Really? </p>

<p>All of sudden everyone is concerned with manipulation on these platforms the past week, becoming super-sleuths and language/data experts within that time, completely oblivious that some of us have been on top of this for years now (and very well warned them specifically of their current situation a long fucking time ago).</p>

<p>They&#39;re not getting our homework and insight for free at this point. There&#39;s ample places for similar information elsewhere. The ginormous difference is no one has focused long-term attentions on their particular sub like we have. Not the mods; not various newbs running their little tools; no one. Aside from probably admins, we few regular users know more about the dynamics of that sub than its entire userbase.&quot;</p>

<p>What do you mean by &quot;homework&quot;, pheephee?</p>

<p>Is this revelation of the method, pheephee?</p>

<p>He won&#39;t come debate me. He won&#39;t play chess with me. He won&#39;t arm wrestle. He&#39;s keeping all of his slam poetry to himself... And he won&#39;t kiss me anymore. I tired to be his friend</p>

<p>Nay, I must feign denial... I was Phoenix trap lover... Phoenix and I were married. And now he&#39;s bringing the divorce into public. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you love me anymore <a href="/u/_ph03nix">/u/_ph03nix</a>? </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/875gld/top_mod_axo_ahem_i_mean_top_mind_rmfn_challenges">https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/875gld/top_mod_axo_ahem_i_mean_top_mind_rmfn_challenges</a></p>

<p>And now they&#39;re too afraid to debate me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting stuff, who&#39;s website is that? It&#39;s fascinating</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From our ‘Superman case’ three years ago until now, we have witnessed a variety of violations in the online environment in Serbia. Specific cases of breaches of online rights and freedoms that our small team has been monitoring are made of arbitrary blocking or filtering of content, cyber attacks on independent online and citizen media, arrests and judicial proceedings against social media users and bloggers, manipulation with the public opinion through the use of different tech tools, surveillance of electronic communications, violation of rights of privacy and protection of personal data; pressure, threats and decreasing the security of online and citizen media journalists and individuals. We filed more than 300 different cases in almost three years, and created a monitoring database that is a foundation for this analysis</p>

<p>A combination of two distinct strategies of astroturfing developed within the Serbian online sphere in recent years, evolving from approaches that, based on their origin and geographical prevalence, could be referred to as Russian and Chinese. While the Chinese approach is marked by the strength of sheer numbers and mostly just cheerleading, the Russian one deals more with the personalised content, active political discussions and attacks on the “internal enemy“</p>

<p>Polemics with the Internal Enemy – In his manual style blogpost Aleksandr Dugin, a Russian right wing political scientist, is proposing a rhetorical frame, which is quite similar to one that we can find in Serbian online sphere. “It is obvious that we have two camps in our country: the patriotic camp (Putin, the people and ‘US’) and the liberal-Western camp (‘THEY’, you know who)… A system of synonyms to be used in polemics should be developed. However, it should be kept in mind that such synonyms need to be symmetrical. For example, THEY call us ‘patriots’, and WE in response use the terms ‘liberals’ and ‘Westerners’ (Russian западники). If THOSE WHO ARE NOT US call us ‘nationalists’, communists’, ‘Soviet’, then our response will be: ‘agent of US influence’ and ‘fifth column’. If they use the term ‘Nazi’ or ‘Stalinist’, our cold-blooded response should be ‘spy’, ‘traitor’, ‘how much did the CIA pay you?’ or ‘death to spies’… An automatic patriotic trolling software, demotivators, memes and virus videos … or similar visual agitation materials for beginner level patriots could also be used against them.”</p>

<p>Found this other article which discusses Russian meddling in Serbia</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dubbed &quot;Putin’s asymmetric assault on democracy in Russia and Europe: implications for US national security&quot; - this is a minority staff report prepared for the Committee on Foreign Relations of the US Senate. </p>

<p>It speaks about the Russian president&#39;s government &quot;engaging for years in a relentless assault to undermine democracy and the rule of law in Europe and the United States.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;&quot;The kicker is he summoned me to /CST, abusing his very own &#39;golden rule&#39; in the process, banned me, then some of them had the gall to message modmail in my super secret laboratory for access. Really? </p>

<p>All of sudden everyone is concerned with manipulation on these platforms the past week, becoming super-sleuths and language/data experts within that time, completely oblivious that some of us have been on top of this for years now (and very well warned them specifically of their current situation a long fucking time ago).</p>

<p>They&#39;re not getting our homework and insight for free at this point. There&#39;s ample places for similar information elsewhere. The ginormous difference is no one has focused long-term attentions on their particular sub like we have. Not the mods; not various newbs running their little tools; no one. Aside from probably admins, we few regular users know more about the dynamics of that sub than its entire userbase.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Phoenix wrote this in the tmor thread linking this it pretty much explains everything.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a sub of links about media manipulation, which is good conspiracy content. The existence of the sub itself doesn&#39;t seem to be a conspiracy, and  it doesn&#39;t indicate that the person curating it is engaging in those techniques, it actually indicates the opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know man. That seems kind of shady. As a rule of thumb I don&#39;t archive or ps private subs, that includes <a href="/r/Conspiracyv2">/r/Conspiracyv2</a>, or any other private sub for that matter. Besides, I&#39;m pretty sure that wouldn&#39;t work to begin with, as archive.com and archive.is wouldn&#39;t be able to access it either, and I&#39;m not doing a ps so don&#39;t even ask. Looking at it now, it&#39;s basically the same shit that&#39;s been there since you saw it last, with a few random news articles about facebook and cambridge analytica added afterward. I&#39;m pretty sure he didn&#39;t set it to private to &#39;hide&#39; anything, more likely to tweak the css or troll this sub, which would be shitty of him but again largely if not entirely irrelevant as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post seems to be written in a comedic way and I laughed a lot. But need to be careful of stopping down to their level. Tmor (which  fittingly autocorrects to Timor) are massive dicks and have wronged key members here severely. But let’s not cross that line that we are blurring and become as bad as they are. If tmor really are a bunch of shills then they are winning, cause we are talking about their manufacturered drama instead of real conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So do you consider r<a href="/r/digital_manipulation">/r/digital_manipulation</a> to be a private TMOR sub page?</p>

<p>If so, that is not the case.</p>

<p>You asked for people to check out the list of MOD&#39;s, and while there is TMOR users, there is also one that is not. Myself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you wanted to call out u/Ph03niX on being a mod of other subs, he ran a bunch of subs, and understanding of the workings of digital manipulation was just a hobby of his.</p>

<p>Seems like you have some pretty strong beef with him. No need to call me out over it though.</p>
