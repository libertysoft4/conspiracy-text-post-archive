        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yes, the manipulation is unbelievably pervasive and sophisticated, but there is still value here. </p>

<p>The technology of reddit simply does not enable a remedy as far as I know, but the manipulation seems to have reached a peak in the last few weeks, and I will explain why I don&#39;t think it can get any worse. In fact, I have noticed a slight decrease in the obvious behaviors such as blatant derailing of productive conversation (thanks to mods I suspect), and a big increase in super sophisticated manipulation that I think 99% (probably even mods) don&#39;t see yet.</p>

<p>That implies that the goal of <a href="http://endofinnocence.com/they-live-cabal-nwo-conspiracy/">the players</a> is to keep 99% (600,000) around so that they can condition us; whereas, they would indeed like for anyone to leave who is calling out their best moves, or who is a threat to their most sacred plays, such as <a href="http://endofinnocence.com/beyond-piercing-illusion-legitimacy-social-contract-psyop-zero-squad/">The Illusion Of Legitimacy</a>.</p>

<p>The new and more sophisticated manipulation seems to be the peak of what is possible. </p>

<p>For example, certain posts that would have gotten 70-90% up votes just 3 months ago, and which start out getting 100% up votes for the first few votes, are now being taken to about 50% and zero votes after the first few minutes and are held there for the first few hours until they have been neutralized, and then they are usually allowed to float more freely after that. This requires a 1-to-1 counter vote for each up vote as they come in, which thus looks pretty natural; whereas, if they can do that, then they could just as easily have sent the post to 10% and kept it there, but that would have be too obvious and thus counter productive.</p>

<p>If there is similar or greater value somewhere else please let me know. The only other place where I have found sufficient value is ZeroHedge, and since I started using reddit in December, I have been on reddit (primarily r/conspiracy) a lot more than ZeroHedge.</p>

<p>I disagree again.  The shills manipulate voting in order to get the &quot;correct&quot; and normally discrediting of the submission to the top, downvoting the &quot;wrong&quot; ones.  This occurs because they know that people generally don&#39;t read the articles, but go to check the comments for a synopsis.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mean to imply that I can always tell, who could?  Most of the time one can.  I also call out those comments when I have time and that&#39;s why so many of my non-&quot;shits and giggles&quot; comments are downvoted into the negatives.</p>

<p>Because I suspect many do as I do and ignore the large majority of them. A lot of threads are hit so hard they could be transplanted into  rpolitics or tmor and you wouldn&#39;t even be able to tell it was a post in conspiracy. When they&#39;re that bad I just completely ignore the obvious shill/troll/bot fest, as I suspect many do.  </p>

<p>Btw the memo this past week must have included the whole &quot;stop whining.&quot; I see it from so many shill accounts all of the sudden.  </p>

<p>The only thing they&#39;re currently accomplishing is to completely swarm threads. If they can&#39;t post, their votes will not matter. What? Every thread is entirely negative comments? Cool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree that it is the wrong move to &quot;jump ship&quot; in the middle of a still winnable battle.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear to me that r/conspiracy was targeted for neutralization both before and especially after the events of 2016 election and related exposures.</p>

<p>In a battle, there can be several valid reasons for holding ground rather than retreating, even if that means greater losses and, basically, a lot of pain. </p>

<p>My mantra is that 9/11 is the lynchpin. When a sizable majority of the citizens of the US feel brave enough to act on what they believe did and did not happen, there will be a change in government - not an overthrow, but a transition, something like what happened when the Russian Federation dismantled the KGB in 1991 and moved its functions to other newly assembled state organizations.</p>

<p>But what is it? You have to know what it is to reject it. We’ve all had the experience of being sure of something until encountering an idea that, after either thought or increases in knowledge, changes your mind. And it’s important to that process that someone was blinded by a lack of knowledge. So unless you think that doesn’t happen, you should acknowledge that we can’t rule that out as a possible explanation. This kind of stuff happens all the time. You’ve had this experience yourself. You’ve known more about something than someone else and they were wrong because of lack of knowledge. They often think their beliefs are obvious. You may believe you are having it right now, to be fair, and there is something I don’t know that if I did would change my position. </p>

<p>Now I understand you want to turn this into a question simply about whether or not you are right or wrong. I’m suggesting it might be impossible for you or I to know that, because there is knowledge we don’t know. Even you seem to believe this because you think most experts agree with you, but won’t say anything for whatever reason. And the movement definitely agrees with this because of the broad support for Engineers and Architects for Truth. Otherwise who cares if they are experts? </p>

<p>See what I’m saying here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not believe that a response is merited for such misdirection and logical errors, but for others who come this far, the official story is that flying debris from the twin towers 300 feet away caused a few sporadic office fires in a wide 48 story building (known as WTC 7), which flexed one of the columns in WTC 7, which then slipped off of its base and not long after that, all of the connections in the buildings broke completely and symmetrically within a couple of seconds of each other, which supposedly explains why the videos seen by hundreds of millions looks exactly like a controlled demolition, which happened just a few hours after the twin towers collapsed.</p>

<p>More important is that whether you believe there is a 1 in 1000 chance that it was NOT a controlled demolition, or a 1 in one million chance it was NOT a controlled demolition, only a globally dominant cabal could have covered that up for 15 years.</p>

<p>Even now, many (perhaps most) people, including engineers and scientists, don&#39;t know that a third tower fell.

<p>Not in this case. We have the video. Only a minimal level of knowledge and experience is required to know that it was a controlled demolition, and beyond that it is much more important that one be honest, intelligent, independent minded, courageous, unbiased, have an instinct for physics and materials, and not have any conflict of interest. Those are worth much more than any amount of expertise in this case.</p>

<p>To have the minimal level of experience and knowledge, one should have seen 20+ fires and 20+ controlled demolitions, played/worked with metal just as much as the average man, and be about 25 years old to have enough first hand experience with materials and probabilities, so I would estimate that half of adult men have sufficient capability or are very close to having sufficient capability.</p>

<p>Maybe it would help to remind you that steel flexes before it bends, and it bends before it breaks, and that for the official <em>theory</em> to be true, hundreds of steel connections would have to have been completely severed all across the first floor of this wide building within .05 seconds of each other, and then .2 seconds later, all of the steel connections on the second floor would have to have been completely severed within .05 seconds of each other, and then .2 seconds later, all of the steel connections on the third floor would have to have been completely severed within .05 seconds of each other, and this pattern would have to repeat for all 48 floors. All of that can only be a controlled demolition. There is nothing natural about it.</p>

<p>Look into ClimateGate and you will lean that those with the most expertise in the Climatology field were perpetrating a fraud with the hockey stick chart, and that a couple of ordinary engineers from Canada busted them, but only after years of obstruction from the expert &quot;scientists&quot; to stop these two engineers from getting the algorithms and the data used to produce the hockey stick chart. &quot;Scientists&quot; all knew that the results had not been reproduced or peer reviewed, but they still tried to obstruct anyone from invalidating the hockey stick chart. If there had not been an email leak, we may never have learned just how corrupt that &quot;scientists&quot; really are, and just how competent ordinary people really are. Before the engineers finally overcame the corruption, how many hundreds of times do you think they were told exactly what you are telling me?</p>

<p>Guys, do you think megalomaniacs ever stop? Obsessives with no emoathy or regret? Power addicts?</p>

<p>Just play a sim game for a bit and think about what you would be willing to do to maintain power. Now think, what if you didn&#39;t have a conscience? And you owe huge debts to gangsters that have blackmail material? OK, maybe you&#39;re strong enough not to be part of the machine at a high level. Would anyone, anyone at all be tempted in and then drawn in over their head?</p>

<p>Do spy agencies ever conceal information?</p>

<p>What is propaganda?</p>

<p>Do rich people ever lie, cooperate or commit crimes?</p>

<p>Even without the mountains of evidence, collusion amongst powerful people makes a hell of a lot more sense then everyone is always nice, never has secrets, or never talks to anyone. You can horse laugh at the concept of a conspiracy theory, but the opposite view that secret crimes don&#39;t occur is either completely childish or nonsensical.</p>

<p>Expert witnesses are experts in the specific, relevant niche, not just a generic field. <em>The vast majority of them have bachelors degrees.</em> The fact that a list was put up for anyone with a certain degree to weigh in should be about as convincing to you or anyone else as the engineers and architect in my family saying the story doesn&#39;t have any red flags to them.

<p>The report I find most convincing is the one conducted by the insurance companies seeking to avoid a payout of hundreds of millions of dollars.

<p>That is the Twin Towers, no one claims they went into freefall, we have been talking about the third skyscraper that was demolished on 9/11, WTC7.</p>

<p>There are more investigations than the initial NIST report, which isn&#39;t set in stone.

These people have the most motivation to cast doubt on the official narrative.</p>

<p>You are incorrect, NIST do claim freefall for 2.25 seconds occurred in WTC7, this isn&#39;t up for debate.</p>

<p>I will quote what they say, which is on page 48</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A more detailed analysis of the descent of the north face found three stages: (1) a slow descent with acceleration less than that of gravity that corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns at the lower floors, (2) <strong>a freefall descent over approximately eight stories at gravitational acceleration for approximately 2.25 s,</strong> and (3) a decreasing acceleration as the north face encountered resistance from the structure below - NIST</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So once again, what did your relatives say about freefall in WTC7, if they don&#39;t have an answer, then they are not qualified to have an opinion on the matter, as ignorance isn&#39;t an argument.</p>

<p>In the draft WTC 7 report (released Aug. 21, 2008; available at <a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/media/NIST_NCSTAR_1A_for_public_comment.pdf">http://wtc.nist.gov/media/NIST_NCSTAR_1A_for_public_comment.pdf</a>), NIST stated that the north face of the building descended 18 stories (the portion of the collapse visible in the video) in 5.4 seconds, based on video analysis of the building collapse. This time period is 40 percent longer than the 3.9 seconds this process would have taken if the north face of the building had descended solely under free fall conditions. During the public comment period on the draft report, NIST was asked to confirm this time difference and define the reasons for it in greater detail.</p>

<p>So what that describes is a structure that begins to collapse, but what&#39;s underneath isn&#39;t falling at freefall yet, so its slower. Then, it falls at freefall matching what is underneath.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, a lot of truth to that.</p>

<p>But there are counter-examples. Politicians generally want their full authority and want the allegiance if not the affection of their constituents. In many cases a &quot;revered leader&quot; figure emerges. Gandhi comes to mind, perhaps Castro for the Cubans, or Ho Chi Minh for the Viets. I&#39;m not arguing for cults of personality, just saying the range of options available is considerably broader than &quot;secret hand&quot; or &quot;figurehead&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sort of mad at everyone who is just quitting.
Not like, ruining my day mad, but when I come to the sub and see all these people just abandoning this sub they supposedly love so much, it’s just like, fuck you then!</p>

<p>I’m a pretty casual user here, but I’ve been on this sub for like 6 years, it’s the reason I made an account. </p>

<p>The idea of just “jumping ship” is the same as admitting defeat. They aren’t leaving and reorganizing somewhere else to fight back, from what they’ve said themselves, they are just <em>leaving</em>. And hoping they <em>find</em> an alternative.</p>

<p>Fuck that. Stay with us. Create an alternative, fight through the storm, there’s still a lot of genuine users here who are getting fucked by this. If you have to sort by new, oh fucking well, big deal? </p>

<p>Maybe I don’t understand the full ‘magnitude’ of whatever it is, “shilling” (a word in so fucking sick of seeing) or bots, or hidden agendas, whatever it is. Personally it’s nothing that’s affecting me in the real life so much that I need to make a post about me quitting. Just seems stupid to me.
Please change my mind if I’m missing something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People going off about quitting are probably a part of the shills trying to demoralize others to get people to quit visiting here. Shills have been hitting /conspiracy hard but their attempts do nothing but get called out and fail flat on their face, even mods are calling them out on their shit. I think all these posts about how &quot;conspiracy is <em>too</em> political&quot; now and wants to go back to talking about hollow earths and moon people are just shills getting tired of fighting a massive wall of genuine users or trying to create a sense of disinterest among the readers.</p>

<p>I mean of course conspiracies are going to be political, we&#39;re living in a really weird time right now with a lot of crazy shit going on politically so of course we&#39;re going to be discussing it and all the conspiracies surrounding it. This sub legitimately feels like one of the last big subs that is transparent and doesn&#39;t shadow delete comments or all that other crazy crap that goes on in main subs here.. one of the last few subs I even visit Reddit for anymore</p>

<p>If it had been purposefully demolished, they wouldn&#39;t pay out a dime. They are incentivized to agree with the demolition version. It literally gets them completely off the hook for paying anything at all.</p>

<p>So what that describes is a structure that begins to collapse, but what&#39;s underneath isn&#39;t falling at freefall yet, so its slower. Then, it falls at freefall matching what is underneath.
