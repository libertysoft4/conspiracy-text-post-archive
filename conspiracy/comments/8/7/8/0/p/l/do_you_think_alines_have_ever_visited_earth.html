    <div class="md"><p>You would feel more at home over at <a href="/r/UFOs">/r/UFOs</a> and <a href="/r/Aliens">/r/Aliens</a>. Good places for questions like those. (I would like to say that alot that i write is <strong>speculation</strong>, so dont take it as the truth, take it as a opinion.)</p>

<p>Well i think with Aliens you mean Intelligent Alien lifeforms that came here. I personally believe yes. There have been over the years some reports of UFOs but that only really started happening in the 40s. During WW2 there where many credible reports of something that wasnt just German.</p>

<p>The reason for that was our first ventures into nuclear fission experiments. Radiosignals are too weak and too abstract. Fission however sends out a beacon of something unmistakably intelligent. It clearly Marks the jump towards a new technological level.</p>

<p>During fission experiments, new types of Elements are formed. So called Isotopes. They differ from normal Elements in that they contain more or less Neutrons (or Protons, but then a new element is formed). This process can produce Isotopes of Elements that simply dont occur in nature. Those Isotopes are often unstable. That means that they decay. During the decay process energy is released in many forms. The one that is of interest is the Neutrino.</p>

<p>Neutrinos are very fast and have very little mass (They pass through matter nearly unimpeded), they have a chance to oscillate between different Generations of matter. From this oscillation you can Infer from which kind of Element the Neutrino (or Antineutrino) was released.</p>

<p>Since the first credible reports (Foo Fighters) where from the Year 1944 and the first Major Fission experiments where done by Rutherford in the year 1932 that gives us approximatly a 12 Lightyear radius in which it may have been picked up. (There where fission experiments before that, but those would not have been detected as artifical in origin.) From then on, there have been many reports of UFOs.</p>

<p>There are many complex reasons as to why they dont interact for now. I will write a post on that this year which you can find in <a href="/r/UFOs">/r/UFOs</a> but i do need some time gather some facts first, do math and other things obviously. </p>

<p>Too reiterate, this is <strong>Speculation</strong> it is Not Fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a couple of starsytems within 12 lightyears. But that doesnt mean that it was a inhabited planet that picked it up. If you have a method of traveling faster than light communicating via EM(Radio, light, X-Ray) becomes impractical(&quot;Only&quot; travels with lightspeed). You would have to have a network of &quot;drones&quot; that collect messages (and other data) and then fly themself to the receiver to relay the message.</p>

<p>Furthermore EM has the Disadvantage that it is easy to be blocked and scatters. If you are on a planet and the want to communicate with someone at the other side of the planet you cant have a direct connection. </p>

<p>Communicating via Neutrinos offers more advantages in this regard,  you can pack more information in an neutrino package then with a photon. A photon always has a certain energy based upon its wavelength there are some tricks to give a individual photon different &quot;states&quot; but all in all neutrinos are a better way of communicating, neutrinos have many more states in which information can be packaged into a single neutrino. It also doesnt interact (much) with normal matter (Photons do). Also they are discrete particles. This means you can &quot;aim&quot; them at the receiver to a certain degree. </p>

<p>Incidentally such a interstellar communication grid would also pick up other useful information, such as neutrinos released from stars (nuclear Fusion), Deposits of Minerals and useful isotopes or as in our case signs of advanced industrial life.  </p>

<p>So this means that there doesnt have to be a alien civilisation within 12 lightyears. it just means it would have been picked up within this radius, its likely that it was picked up earlier, but obviously i cannot rule out anything. But then again what are the odds of having Another advanced civilisation so close by right?</p>

<p>And as always, this is <strong>Speculation</strong> ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the kind of speculation I love though.  The big thing to me about alien life is the problem of it not having already colonized the universe (i.e. it took humans 13 billion years to exist, but anything that beat us by even a mere couple billion years should right now, even lacking FTL travel, should be freaking EVERYWHERE).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really but the &quot;no interference&quot; policies because evolution is war, and anything that evolved a no-interfere policy would be supplanted by anything that didn&#39;t evolve a no-interfere policy.</p>

<p>Similarly, aliens finding &quot;sentience&quot; precious is likely just human projection-- we are curious monkeys, but a species evolved from a catlike creature, or a reptile might utterly lock that kind of curiosity.  We also keep pets, which makes us natural at interfacing with &quot;aliens&quot; but a species that doesn&#39;t keep pets would likely lack any kind of desire to &quot;get to know&quot; other species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh most def,  i like speculating. You make great points! </p>

<p>I didnt say that they would have a non interference policy. you mean the Fermi Paradox Perhaps. If Intelligent life is ubiquitous... why haven&#39;t we seen any?   I am working on a Satisfying solution to the Fermi Paradox that i will post on reddit sometime this year (that one will contain very little speculation). So i guess you gotta wait, dont wanna drop unsubstantiated factoids just now. </p>

<p>A solitary species would never archive Civilization. That can only be done via a Social Species. Be them Reptile or whatever that doesnt really matter, they would need to start out as social and would show quite a few similarities with us.</p>

<p>To even have a Hammer you would need Folks going down the Mines(which have to be dug), getting iron ore. Having some other folks smelt it. A Smith forging it and a Trader Selling it. This is impossible if the species isnt highly social. A Society cannot be built by Individuals, only a group of people can do that. If you put a child on a deserted island. It may survive, but after 30 years it would resemble something more akin to an Animal then to a Human. Alone we are nothing.  </p>

<p>That being said, we dont know how a Society will change. Who could have guessed that having a Powerful Pocketsized supercomputer (smartphone) widely available would make people actually less social, more gullible and Stupid? Its hard to guess how a Society will change when a new technology is introduced, then society WILL change, but it will always remain a Social Society or it will Perish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I didn&#39;t mean non-social species.  I agree with you on that.  But (and this isn&#39;t my point, it&#39;s Larry Niven&#39;s) humans might be unique in that we actually love other species-- dogs, cats, even snakes and gerbils.  We&#39;re an amazingly empathic species (and if cows ever colonize space, it will be in human spaceships, so we&#39;re very cooperative with our &quot;partner&quot; species too).</p>

<p>So the point would be... if you had a species that got sentient+space travel that DIDN&#39;T have any inclination to understand/cooperate with other species (i.e. never needed to understand wolves to bring them in to assist in guarding the house... never needed to understand the mind of a sheep in order to properly herd it)... such a species might have no real inclination to even make contact, we&#39;d just be another animal to them.  Whereas humans project sentience onto our pets, onto dolphins, onto whales, onto everything really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh ok, i misunderstood you. Sorry.</p>

<p>When you  put it like that you are absolutely right, there will be differences. But those will feel like &quot;cultural&quot; differences. I have lived in a few places in the world and its staggering how different we think. For example you see a Dolphin as something sentient and cute, while many people around the world would see it as something Tasty or irrelevant.</p>

<p>We get along GREAT with other Cultures right? There is never any kind of problems when Cultures Clash, so what could possibly go wrong when we Interact with a Different intelligent species /s </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Counterpoint: Compared to other species, we actually DO get along pretty well.  Think about when two ant hills meet each other, or when two baboon tribes cross paths, or two wolf packs.  Relative to the rest of earth, humans are evolution&#39;s stoned hippies!</p>

<p>We have a lot of self hate, but it&#39;d be funny if we went into space and we ended up being the most enlightened, get-along-gang of the bunch, just because our evolution has made us very cooperative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well all i have to go on is ancient texts that tell us about people who came from the sky , in the Bible we call them either &quot;God , god ,Lord , lord or Angels&quot; </p>

<p>this says to be theres one group &quot;God&quot; and a second , the latter always having a lower case = lord , god . or Angels .</p>

<p>if we have one guy or small group with another subservient group who came from the sky and seeded a race .</p>

<p>ancient Summer tells us in their texts that a group just like this seeded man and put him to work in gold mines .</p>

<p>ancient Hopi Indians tell us of a race who took the Hopi underground before a deluge wiped out the inhabitants of the surface before reemerging when the flood subsided .</p>

<p>in middle eastern tradition we learn of a &quot;God&quot; telling a man to build an Arc .</p>

<p>this foretelling of a deluge around the planet leads one to a tricky question of time travel . a created species by others who came from the sky .</p>

<p>another problem starts because we have 2 groups of people on either side of the planet being told of a flood by 2 distinct groups . or we get a glimpse of a third group .</p>

<p>firstly the &quot;God&quot; in the middle east is said to be human looking as he made us in his image .  the second group we read is indistinguishable from man too .. Angels .</p>

<p>another problem starts here because we also have ancient texts that tell us of a reptile like race ..</p>

<p>and ..</p>

<p>on the other side of the planet the Hopi Indians tell us of a race that look like Ants ..</p>

<p>an even bigger mystery starts in south America with their ancient texts telling us of a feathered serpent race  .... hang on ...</p>

<p>so .. in the northern plains  there are people who wear feathers as a head dress and talk about ancient sky visitors .. in the south west they tell us of Ant like people ..</p>

<p>in the south reptile looking people who adorn them selves with feathers ..</p>

<p>i think this is a case of reptiles seeing the north has a race from the sky coming here and go south taking a human cultural aspect with them, the feather head dress ..</p>

<p>in the middle east the reptile like beings do not have feathers ..</p>

<p>to me its almost like a human looking race with subservient lesser beings came to the middle east and said .. right this is my turf ..</p>

<p>a second went to north America and stated  the same .. this is my turf .. then another came and seen only a small portion of the middle east was taken and decided to set up came there and then decided to look at the Americas but found a race had already laid claim to it ..</p>

<p>i am not a naive person , i do not take what i am told at face value , i do not believe humans were the first rave to exist in the infinite of space , billions of years have passed and i strongly believe we are a young race and older more advanced races found us and capitalized on our superstitions and lack of knowledge .. </p>

<p>if we take the beings said to be reptilian , we can see a switch from what they did in the middle east to what they did in south America . this says to be they liked human culture and decided to capitalize on it by mimicking  it , i believe they seen tribal leaders in the North of America using feather head dresses as a sign of a leader of high importance and took this in to make tribes in south America see them as important .. i also believe they took a darker side to human culture to the south Americas with them , human sacrifice .</p>

<p>switching to modern day i see a turf war happening .. let me explain ..</p>

<p>middle east and south America is rich in oil .. North America is trying to gain  control of this . the reptiles and Ant like beings fighting for oil ?  not so hard to believe that we may be pawns in an inter galactic turf war . </p>

<p>today we call them &quot;greys&quot; and &quot;reptiles&quot; , aliens . what if its all true ? we see symbolism every where of reptiles in the roman church . we know they hoard gold .. south America .. gold and oil .. middle east mostly oil ..</p>

<p>north America .. is this a strong hold for the &quot;greys&quot; ? are they at war with the reptiles ? .. what about the human like beings who are said to have seeded Adam and Eve ? are they the Nordic type alien we hear about in modern times ?</p>

<p>what is it they want / gold / oil ? or something else ? </p>

<p>i believe people know the truth and set up a governing system to keep this from us because the truth of them being our &quot;Gods, gods ,Lords or lord&quot; is simply a lie ..  </p>

<p>as a young species who is now starting to become technically advanced  we may have the weapons to fight back .. is this the reason for the department of defense now leaking videos of unidentified craft ? are they going to come out and tell us our ancient gods were just aliens who decided to enslave a young naive superstitious race  but we now have what we need to free our selves from them ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh most def,  i like speculating. You make great points! </p>

<p>I didnt say that they would have a non interference policy. you mean the Fermi Paradox Perhaps. If Intelligent life is ubiquitous... why haven&#39;t we seen any?   I am working on a Satisfying solution to the Fermi Paradox that i will post on reddit sometime this year (that one will contain very little speculation). So i guess you gotta wait, dont wanna drop unsubstantiated factoids just now. </p>

<p>A solitary species would never archive Civilization. That can only be done via a Social Species. Be them Reptile or whatever that doesnt really matter, they would need to start out as social and would show quite a few similarities with us.</p>

<p>To even have a Hammer you would need Folks going down the Mines(which have to be dug), getting iron ore. Having some other folks smelt it. A Smith forging it and a Trader Selling it. This is impossible if the species isnt highly social. A Society cannot be built by Individuals, only a group of people can do that. If you put a child on a deserted island. It may survive, but after 30 years it would resemble something more akin to an Animal then to a Human. Alone we are nothing.  </p>

<p>That being said, we dont know how a Society will change. Who could have guessed that having a Powerful Pocketsized supercomputer (smartphone) widely available would make people actually less social, more gullible and Stupid? Its hard to guess how a Society will change when a new technology is introduced, then society WILL change, but it will always remain a Social Society or it will Perish. </p>
