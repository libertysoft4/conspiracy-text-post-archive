        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>(This is a re-post, admittedly)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this self post will gain much traction, but I want to try.</p>

<p>This subreddit has always been beset by a very partisan framework, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary that it needs to continue that way.</p>

<p>There are people who will ALWAYS vote against a certain party, here. There are people who will ALWAYS support a certain party, here. That is not the fault of this subreddit, it&#39;s a sad reflection of our winner-take-all system of elections, in the United States, and the predominance of US electoral politics and current events on the conspiracies debated here.</p>

<p>But I want to offer a different divide, at least for American voters using this subreddit to discuss and learn:</p>

<p>(1) Corporations are the main drivers of dehumanizing, impoverishing, illegal conspiracies set upon the people of the United States...and this is accomplished via the corruption of our elected government.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>(2) The government is the main driver of dehumanizing, impoverishing, illegal conspiracies set upon the people of the United States...and this is accomplished via the corruption of our free market.</p>

<p>Obviously, it&#39;s a mix of both, at this point. The two are so entangled it&#39;s hard to suss out.</p>

<p>But &quot;leftists&quot; on this board are generally (1), and &quot;conservatives&quot; on this board are generally (2).</p>

<p>If we can, perhaps, get past party identification and support of this or that politician, and rework our discussions into whether corporations are corrupting our government, or our government is corrupting the free market...maybe we&#39;d be a little more true to our ACTUAL beliefs, maybe we could forego a lot of the defense of this or that individual politician, and we could have a REAL discussion that isn&#39;t just a ridiculous proxy for the Fox News vs. MSNBC rhetoric wars?</p>

<p>Just an idea, a way to have more meaningful and fruitful discussions on the &quot;political&quot; debates in this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep telling anarchist that they aren&#39;t prepared for what they&#39;re asking for.</p>

<p>Very few people raised in a heavily governed society could handle anarchy.  If you want shit like the KKK, the Mafia, drug Lords and Scientology to have real power then go ahead and fire up the anarchy driven society.  It would last for about 50 years tops before some group like mentioned above took over completely.  Then anarchy is gone and so is the Constitution.  No going back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not supposed to be sudden. We have to work through the national scale, and gradually devolve power back to the localities. It&#39;s about free associations and not forced ones. Anarchy doesn&#39;t mean chaos- it means radical democracy on the local level and nested associations working up to the Federal. It&#39;s not lack of government- it&#39;s justification of all hierarchical institutions, and if they can&#39;t justify their existence, they aren&#39;t legitimate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry man, you absolutely have to find a new name for what you&#39;re calling anarchy.  Someone lied to you.</p>

<p>Anarchy</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The no recognition part is how most anarchists behave, it&#39;s a dead end path.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>radical democracy on the local level and nested associations working up to the Federal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds quite good but not at all related to anarchy. Sorry of I&#39;m standing on a language issue but it&#39;s important we accurately use the right words for things.  I&#39;ve met hard core communists who call themselves anarchist but everything they describe is Communism.  It&#39;s a recruiting technique.  </p>

<p>What you&#39;re describing is very similar to a standard federation or republic.</p>

<p>I get where your coming from but what Rudolph was experiencing is falling in love with the battlefield, a lot of vet experience that when they get home from a war.  A revolution is exactly the environment that anarchy exists in, but it&#39;s not a permanent system.  Anarchy is that period of time between the fall of one government and the rise of it&#39;s replacement.  It will naturally go away by means of force or cooperation.  On one side you get a tyranny and the other you get a government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rocker wrote about the Spanish syndicalists who were crushed by Franco during the civil war. Catalonia was self-ruling and organized by its working class for several years in the 1930&#39;s, but as the national government broke down and the communists guerrillas rose up all they worked for was destroyed. The Syndicalists were already a functioning aspect of Spanish society before the civil war.</p>

<p>Orwell was there too, before the full on civil war, and he wrote highly of the Catalonian syndicalist society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it amusing that people genuinely believe the market and the government of America/EU are opposed.  We are constantly fed the notion that the market and the economy is some sort of deity that must be appeased with privatizations and tax breaks for corporations for the super rich, and that to do otherwise invites disaster.  That has been the tune played at full volume for as long as I&#39;ve been alive, and the results are what you have seen since the Reagan and Clinton era.  What disagreements a particular business may have with the government are merely a matter of businesses trying to gain a competitive advantage, rather than any fundamental conflict - some oil business complains about environmental regulations, some health insurance company doesn&#39;t want to cover sick people or old people, etc.  There is no deep-seated conflict between the permanent bureaucracy as a whole and the interests of business, which is why we&#39;re not hearing about the Pentagon&#39;s funding being cut or the CIA being cut.  They (both Republicans and Democrats, today) do have a deep-seated conflict with the parts of the bureaucracy that were created to placate the masses, like Social Security, but only so far as they exist to help the masses survive; they don&#39;t have a problem with, for example, means-testing or bureaucratic tricks to cut people off of assistance.  I believe it was one of the Austrian School guys who suggested terminating the civil rights of people on welfare, like not allowing them to vote, which tells you everything you need to know about the Austrian School.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how anyone who seriously questions the powers that be can not question the market, how they can seriously believe in something like anarcho-capitalism if they are the least bit aware of what is going on.  It doesn&#39;t need to be a blind acceptance of communism or Marxism or whatever, but it should be obvious that many of the memes we&#39;re fed about the market are propaganda.</p>

<p>As far as the quadrennial circuses matter, they&#39;re not something worth serious investment.  I thought 2016 was going to be the ultimate insult of Clinton vs. Bush, but they managed to outdo themselves with the latest debacle.  I would hope most of the people here see the debacle for what it is, rather than attaching some significance to Trump (there is simply no organic support for Clinton; even the elites who backed Clinton don&#39;t want her, they just have to put up with her because of the Clinton fortune).  I think a bigger issue than mere Trump supporters are out-and-out fascists who are using this platform to spread their ideology, and that really goes beyond simple political posts.  I think with most Trump support, it&#39;s not about Trump the man - everyone should know he&#39;s a goddamned fool - but that Trump is a means towards their own ends, even if those ends are the feefees they get when Trump says some hi-larious racist shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have to admit I got rolled up in that for awhile. However, I realized I needed to take a step back from the fray and be objective.</p>

<p>I am always a floating voter, and had allowed myself to get swept up in the drama. So, I exited the resistance and researched all opinions, instead. Came to the general consensus that the division is horse shit, being pedaled so as to create division rather than to heal it.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I discovered I am a left leaning libertarian, rather than the democratic socialist I though I was. I am now exploring all opinions and learning fat more than I ever did in the liberal echo chamber.</p>

<p>We are all humans and listening to other opinions should not exclude ones you don&#39;t like. If something makes you uncomfortable, it can teach you important shit about yourself.</p>

<p>Anyway, hope that made some sense and much love, to you all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, the way I see it. DJT can be used to win this war. He may be a puppet, but I believe the people do have the power to use him as president for good. If the people could understand the full gravity of our situation and what the forces are that are happening around us, Trump could use his platform to inform the world whats behind the curtain. IMO, Congress and the Judiciary are the real problems in govt. president is merely there for publicity and either taking blame or praise. Executive branch is only there to execute orders.</p>
