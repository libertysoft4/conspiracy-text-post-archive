<p>This sounds like a stupid question, but it is exactly the principle embraced by some Politicians, many in California.</p>

<p>Efforts to identify Foreign Nationals via the Census are being touted as UNFAIR TO AMERICANS.</p>

<p>So, is a Mexican (or other) National, standing on American soil an American? Is that all that is required to be entitled to the rights, privileges and protections available to all Americans?</p>

<p>Clearly, some would say NO. Standing on US soil does not an American make. But some are insisting that Foreign Nationals have the same rights as citizens. And are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections provided to the US Citizen.</p>

<p>How can this be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you bother to read it? The claims are verifiable.</p>

<p>Also of note </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judicial Watch sent notice-of-violation letters threatening to sue 11 other states having counties in which the number of registered voters exceeds the number of voting-age citizens, as calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2011-2015 American Community Survey: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina and Tennessee. Judicial Watch informed the states that should they fail to take action to correct violations of Section 8 of the NVRA, it would file suit.</p>

<p>Judicial Watch previously filed successful lawsuits under the NVRA against Ohio and Indiana that resulted in those states taking several actions to clean up their voting rolls. Judicial Watch is currently suing Kentucky over its failure to remove ineligible voters as required by the NVRA, and is suing the State of Maryland and Montgomery County over their failure to release voting-related records.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Judicial has won successful lawsuits under the NVRA.</p>

<p>Have you made any attempts to verify Judaical Watch&#39;s claims that CA counties are not NVRA compliment? What claims do you disagree with?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh bullshit, who exactly are these, California politicians, promoting the vote for non-citizens.</p>

<p>I replied and posed a simple question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why isn&#39;t CA NVRA compliant?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a question you really don&#39;t want to answer. I pointed out some CA counties are not NVRA compliant. You can verify this for yourself. The simplest claim is certain CA counties have not not cleaned rolls. They haven&#39;t. It isn&#39;t debatable. That nothing to do with Judicial Watch.</p>

<p>The goal was to have a discussion but you refuse to acknowledge facts and answer simple questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some Constitutional protections do extend to foreign nationals on US soil. The right to vote does not extend to them, and it should not.</p>

<p>The census question about citizenship is unfair to American citizens because census data is used to make decisions that affect American citizens. That data is used to determine how many hospitals, roads, schools, etc. are required in a given area. You may dislike illegal immigration, and you may believe that illegal immigrants shouldn&#39;t be using our hospitals, roads, and schools. But the reality is, these people are here, and they use those things. </p>

<p>If the census adds a citizenship question, then immigrants are going to be less likely to respond. If regions are under-counted as a result, then that is going to negatively impact the American citizens in those regions.</p>
