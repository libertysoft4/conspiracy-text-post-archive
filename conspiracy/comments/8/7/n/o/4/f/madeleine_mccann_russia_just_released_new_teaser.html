<p>They are not images of abductors plural; they are two images of one abductor, as described by different members of the same family, who in their accompanying description made it clear they were talking about someone much younger than either of the Podestas.</p>

<p>The resemblance is enough to establish probable cause for further investigation.  At the very least, the police need to determine if either one of the Podesta&#39;s was out of the U.S. at the time.  If they were, then that is probable cause to check if they were in Europe at the time.  It can continue from there, or not...  </p>

The evidence of the cadaver dogs, and the inconsistencies in the story from the family and friends just doesn’t add up to an abduction to me.

Also the dodgy companies and people the family have employed to help them look for her are a red flag. </p>

<p>The evidence of the cadaver dogs</p>

<p>Have you looked at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTF4JTLeOWA">video of the cadaver dogs</a>? With the car, the handler does not appear to be treating all cars equally, repeatedly calling the dog back to the McCann&#39;s car: <a href="https://youtu.be/FTF4JTLeOWA?t=68">here</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/FTF4JTLeOWA?t=122">here</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/FTF4JTLeOWA?t=135">here</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/FTF4JTLeOWA?t=161">here</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same in the apartment. The handler keeps drawing the dog back to the cupboard: <a href="https://youtu.be/c4NMYPsFKb8?t=173">here</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/c4NMYPsFKb8?t=293">here</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/c4NMYPsFKb8?t=299">here</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/c4NMYPsFKb8?t=315">here</a>.</p>

<p>As well, Britain&#39;s National Policing Improvement Agency looked at the use of such dogs and found that they were not trained to approved standards and there was no way of gauging their competence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the parents did kill their daughter then they wouldn&#39;t be fighting to find her after all this time, just be quiet and let it go away. I know in South Australia, word from the police is it was the parents but I dont buy it. Pommy cops can transfer to south Australian police service easily. They keep rank and if they stick around for two years, they can become Aussies. Theres so many of them in SA because of this rule and.thats where they heard about Madeleine.</p>
