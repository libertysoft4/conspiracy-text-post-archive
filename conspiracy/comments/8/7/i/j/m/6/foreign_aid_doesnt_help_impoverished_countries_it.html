        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>The answer to poverty, Freedom</strong></p>

<p>The 2018 Index of Economic Freedom, an annual study that ranks 180 countries for their economic freedom using hard data, has now been published by The Heritage Foundation.</p>

<p>The results, when combined with poverty data from the World Bank, show that inhabitants of countries who enjoy high levels of economic freedom are far less likely to suffer from abject poverty.</p>

<p>In countries that rank in the top fifth, less than 1 percent of the population (on average) subsists on $1.90 per day or less. Meanwhile, in countries that rank in the bottom fifth, an average 27 percent of the population subsists on $1.90 per day.</p>

<p>This bottom tier is represented by economic freedom-repressed countries like Togo, Chad, and Niger. In Togo, roughly 50 percent of the population lives on $1.90 a day or less. In Chad, according to the latest data, the portion of the population living on $1.90 a day is 38.4 percent. In Niger, it is 45.5 percent, as of 2014.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Strongmen who disregard property rights or the rule of law to remain in power have been rewarded with billions of dollars in foreign aid from rich countries for decades. Despots and dictators have often used this aid to solidify their grips on power, such as by withholding food aid from groups that do not support them.</p>

<p>These strongmen and dictators often take credit for bringing foreign aid to their countries while depriving their country’s people of the economic freedom they would need to end the dependence on foreign aid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The true answer to poverty in some cases would ultimately be eugenics.  We have tried teaching them, metaphorically, how to fish but they are incapable of learning.  Supporting them with handouts allows them to procreate without any regard for the ramifications which increases the future poverty logarithmically which will ultimately just require more and larger handouts.  It is nothing but a feel-good solution that does far more harm than good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im not the same person - i saw your replies and felt the same frustration at your absurd reply but ok i&#39;ll bite:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nazi eugenics (German: Nationalsozialistische Rassenhygiene, &quot;National Socialist racial hygiene&quot;) were Nazi Germany&#39;s racially based social policies that placed the biological improvement of the Aryan race or Germanic &quot;Übermenschen&quot; master race through eugenics at the center of Nazi ideology.[1] In Germany, eugenics were mostly known under the synonymous term racial hygiene. Following the Second World War, both terms effectively vanished and were replaced by Humangenetik (human genetics).</p>

<p>Eugenics research in Germany before and during the Nazi period was similar to that in the United States (particularly California), by which it had been partly inspired. However, its prominence rose sharply under Adolf Hitler&#39;s leadership when wealthy Nazi supporters started heavily investing in it. The programs were subsequently shaped to complement Nazi racial policies.[2]</p>

<p>Those humans targeted for destruction under Nazi eugenics policies were largely living in private and state-operated institutions, identified as &quot;life unworthy of life&quot; (German: Lebensunwertes Leben), including prisoners, &quot;degenerates&quot;, dissidents, people with congenital cognitive and physical disabilities (including people who were &quot;feebleminded&quot;, epileptic, schizophrenic, manic-depressive, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, deaf, blind) (German: erbkranken), homosexual, idle, insane, and the weak, for elimination from the chain of heredity. More than 400,000 people were sterilized against their will, while more than 70,000 were killed under Action T4, a euthanasia program.[3][4][5][6] In June 1935, Hitler and his cabinet made a list of seven new decrees, number 5 was to speed up the investigations of sterilization.[7]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All copy pasted from wikipedia. Also, might help if you actually read about the things you promote. </p>

<p>Morally, I don&#39;t object the concept of eugenics, just a small tip to avoid looking like a total dumbass on the internet.</p>

<p>(Interestingly, almost all of the people I met who like the idea of eugenics are the ones who are most likely to be genetically screened.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry for my aggressive reply (regardless if you were offended or not) There are some things that I would like to share:</p>

<p>one reason for my aggressive reply was your response- </p>

<p>Instead of asking for evidence, why not ask why would it be bad even if it was espoused by hitler/nazis as well?</p>

<p>additional talking points:</p>

<p>UN-Lucis Trust-Nazi connection:</p>

<p>Removing the conspiracy element, its interesting that the United Nations adhere to similar ideas from hitler&#39;s mein kampf- which includes a one world government and a eugenically cleansed society.
You could say that its basically the guiding principle for their vision of a unified world. On that end, you can say that you arrived at the same conclusion as hitler and other students of the same esoteric school of thought(theosophy) which is ascribed to by the players in our world government.</p>

<p>On the topic of African Poverty, here&#39;s a good link that discusses the myriad of reasons (albeit hinting at the low-iq factor as well) that causes this unending problem:</p>

<p><a href="https://fee.org/articles/the-sorry-record-of-foreign-aid-in-africa/">https://fee.org/articles/the-sorry-record-of-foreign-aid-in-africa/</a></p>

<p>anecdote: (cannot find an online resource at the moment)</p>

<p>Some african tribes purposely ruin the projects and <em>aids</em> (heh)provided to them. On that note, i&#39;d say rather than international aid or eugenics, (as an outsider) i&#39;d opt for non-intervention as the holistic solution to their problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ohhh, do you guys think that what the Nazis did was actual eugenics?</p>

<p>First and foremost: true eugenics <strong>does not involve death or forced breeding</strong>. It is for the objective benefit of <em>all</em> humans, and murder and forced reproduction are incompatible with this standard. What the Nazis did was an amoral perversion.</p>

<p>A properly and <em>ethically</em> implemented eugenics program would involve voluntary, incentivized sterilization for people with issues like low IQ and heritable disease, coupled with voluntary, incentivized reproduction (or sperm/egg donation) from people with desirable traits like high IQ or other heritable advantages. The benefits would take many generations to see full fruition, but that&#39;s considered just fine, because it&#39;s for the benefit of <em>all</em> mankind, not just the current generations.</p>

<p>The Nazi work on Genetics was a double edge sword. It was groundbreaking, important, and beneficial on the whole. Conversely, people freak right the fuck out when you delve into certain areas, and it&#39;s got a very dark period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure where you get your IQ statistics. I think what you might mean to say is that they are uneducated. That is an easy fix. Instead of massively expensive infrastructure projects that benefit business (and are built on debt, which can&#39;t be repaid except by selling off profitable resources at a fraction of there value). Countries build schools, and negotiate trade relationships for the real cost of their goods. Corruption in South and Central America are backed by military and economic power projected by the first world. There is no implicit reason for these countries to be impoverished other than exploitation by wealthy nations and international corporations (which have the backing of first world economic and military power). Well, I guess we can have a start at the America&#39;s before moving to Africa, the Middle East, and Asia/Pacific. The reasons for poverty in the third world are fairly elementary to understand. The solutions are equally simple; the reduction of interference by the US empire and it&#39;s European allies. Cuba is a fine example of a country that would do quiet well with out a boycott by the US and pressures to block trade/aid from other countries. Easily seen in the Monroe Doctrine (which I assume has been strengthened over the years).  As for some of your other points, basic medical care and family planning would go a long way before eugenics. We could certainly start with the undesirable populations in the US. </p>

<p>No offense intended, but you could not be more incorrect on the subject.  Ashkenazi jews fall around 115ish on the bell curve.  Asians around 105-110 depending on the country.  Whites are slightly above 100.  Hispanic/Latins fall in around 90.  US blacks at 85.  Subsaharans literally around 60.  There is a wealth of research out there that confirms all of this and I have studied it myself relatively in-depth.  </p>

<p>Just suppose that I am correct and accurate.  Why do you suppose you have been lead to believe what is quite contrary?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have lead to believe the contrary by reading of scientific research filtered through popular science magazines (Science, Scientific American) and academic study of psychology and special education. I have read articles on IQ distribution across populations as well as the criticism of such studies. I don&#39;t find the area to be well studied and sample sizes tend to be small. As for Sub-Saharan Africa, my first two articles (from Google) placed the IQ at 80. One did offer reasons for bias and factors like malnutrition. I am familiar with studies that support your point of view. I have not come across a &quot;wealth&quot; of information supporting your convictions. I am not convinced of there accuracy when other factors are considered. As I said, sources of information tends to bias ones point of view. As much as wikipedia is disregarded as a source of information, a quick read of Race and IQ touches on several of the studies and factors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just posted one of the biggest debates in political science in 2 alineas. It is indeed a very interesting question how to use money for developing the third world. The problem many identify is an inherant cost of liberalism. Governments invest in a country&#39;s economy, they invest in people with ideas. The irony of liberal politicians and institutions such as the UN that have many times attacked the principle of trickle-down economics, yet basically making trickle-down the core of their use of investments, is unfortunately lost on many. </p>

<p>From the 90&#39;s onward, mostly post-kolonialist and post-marxist researchers started questioning this line of development, as they saw that too little is being done to stop actual and very real poverty. What good do macro-economic numbers mean to a country if the big majority of the people is living in hunger and dies from the most basic of diseases? Ofcourse there is also the problem of dictators raking in the money themselves, this problem has in my opinion slightly been overblown. But it is a real problem and should in no way be ignored. The problem with development is that it is and will mostly always be rooted in a liberal nation-state reality, so it is really hard to circumvent these dictators, this however does not mean that we should stop trying.</p>

<p>I thought trickle-down economics is making investments into private corporations that will provide support to current and future employers/customers; not provide investments in the central government(s). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good question. I should specify more. </p>

<p>The idea that is often used in third-world countries (exceptions such as micro-credits do exist), is that by directly dealing with poverty, you don&#39;t help a country become self-dependant. So instead of investing in people, they invest in companies to help a countries&#39; macro-economy. The idea is ofcourse that this will create more jobs, and once you get a job, you get a good life. Except that&#39;s not what happend in countries such as India or on the continent of Africa. What happend is that a few people got rich, and the rest is still piss-poor. </p>
