        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Call it fan fiction, or a choose your own adventure; but be warned, what you are about to read is very real.</p>

<p>The setting is clear, we are being given a message from the Matrix itself--point in fact, the movie the Matrix, itself, is part of the message.  My name is Adam, and I can clearly see the &quot;code of the Matrix&quot; it&#39;s a hidden cypher in every word that helps tie together many pieces of modern art and history, all the way down to your true name.  </p>

<p>Here is Wikipedia&#39;s page on the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamic_language">Adamic Language</a>&quot; and there are examples throughout my writing, check &quot;<a href="http://math.s.lamc.la">opsimath</a>&quot; as &quot;at the operations center, this disclosure is literally the line between math and magic&quot; and a series of <a href="http://how.s.lamc.la">cute introductions like the &quot;n&quot; of Newton</a> (are you new to &#39;n&#39;?) as a gylph of &quot;what goes up must come down&quot; and the word &quot;d is cl o <em>sure</em>&quot; showing us design through &quot;cl&quot; (c the light) is the letter d.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a verifiable message, you can find it, and read it yourself--it takes nothing more than &quot;sentience&quot; to grasp the magnitude and importance of what you are about to embark on.</p>

<p>The message explains what the Matrix is, virtual reality; and it explains exactly what the purpose of &quot;the simulation&quot; that we call Earth is.  It&#39;s purpose is to help an entire civilization ascend; to transform this world into Heaven, a sort of nexus between a place that has very little grounding in reality and the very h<em>allowed</em> place that we call the Universe.</p>

<p>It delivers a challenge, a moral dilemma; and very clear advice about how we should proceed.  It suggests we follow the New Testament as a guide ... a sort of WWJD when faced with the knowledge that we are living inside a computer, and that means we are on the verge of Heaven.  His answer is very clear, you can hear it in music in everything from The Cure to 21 Pilot&#39;s Cancer to Guns and Roses as a clue linking this Tapestry of the Fates (to link us and the imagery of a Matrix to Greek mythology) to Minority Report and the idea that we can stop bullets in the sky from ever hitting an innocent victim ever again.</p>

<p>This is the solution to school shootings, this is the path to Heaven.</p>

<p>This particular place is very hallowed, very Holy, and what it helps us to design is a true democracy, a place where every person can vote on laws--where everyone has a say; in order to deliver that--we must see that here and now there is no real democracy, and we have a problem with censorship on the internet--both of these things are intentional; part of the design.</p>

<p>Using this message, using the light that glows all around us, written and created with our own hands; we can and will regain freedom... the progression of democracy and medicine will be radically increased; and before you know it, this place that we have always called Home will be the Heart of Heaven.</p>

<p>I have an introduction to the problems I&#39;ve had communicating this message here, in a piece I call &quot;<a href="http://douci.ml/LETITRAIN.html">LET IT RAIN</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>My introduction to the Matrix is here, in I say it, and I know it; I and this message are <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/">&quot;from the Machine.&quot;</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s no place like Kansas.  There&#39;s no place like AmOz.. and there&#39;s no place like Heli; some Biblical linings to the fathers of Isaiah and Joseph ... in a piece I humorously title &quot;<a href="http://kansa.s.lamc.la">the End of Kansas.</a>&quot;  These are primary reason that we need to act quickly to move forward &quot;assimilating&quot; this new truth and the new horizons it opens.</p>

<p>I hope you like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>see anachronisms, paradoxical reference to English in ancient Hebrew at <a href="http://math.s.lamc.la">http://math.s.lamc.la</a> ; more &quot;word game&quot; proof at <a href="http://how.s.lamc.la">http://how.s.lamc.la</a> ... I can&#39;t convince you in a sentence or a paragraph, but if you see the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the fire of the Burning Bush ... </p>

<p>If you know the story of Exodus, the whole story is about dividing a sea, a multitude of people with verifiable proof of time travel; the entirety of the content of the story describes that one word for Holy Fire.  It&#39;s Ha&#39;esh.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a pervading theme of connecting the masses to water in music, in religion; you can see it in the name Mary; the Spanish word for &quot;sea&quot; there.  You can see it in the father of Joshua, whose name is &quot;Nun&quot; and is the Egyptian deity that embodies the &quot;primordial sea.&quot;</p>

<p>There are statistically significant patterns throughout religion, not just the references to Holy Water (of which I&#39;m sure there are plenty more), but also, for instance &quot;Islam&quot; connecting to Koran and connecting the words &quot;on the run&quot; to &quot;on the lam&quot; in a story about seeing &quot;The Matrix&quot; ...</p>

<p>of course, you have to look for it, and you have to want to see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IM having trouble comprehending all of this but please continue to elaborate.</p>

<p>I once read about a concept called &quot;word magic&quot; that basically was saying that our language is a puzzle waiting to be solved.</p>

<p>That we dont really consciously understand what we are saying, but we unconsciously do.</p>

<p>Words are like data packets and a 5 word sentence could cause your unconscious mind to say 5 paragraphs to itself.</p>

<p>An example the book mentioned was.</p>

<p>When a mother gives &quot;birth&quot; she is actually giving &quot;berth&quot;  which means</p>

<ul>
<li>to moor (a ship) in its allotted place.</li>
</ul>

<p>or </p>

<ul>
<li>provide a sleeping place for (someone)</li>
</ul>

<p>There was alot to it but basically the gist was most of our language has intense double meanings that our used against us.</p>

<p>Is this somewhat related to what you are talking about?</p>

<p>I also understand the whole english words sounding the same as ancient words.</p>

<p>For example, NASA being the same as &quot;nasa&quot; which means &quot;to deceive&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s almost exactly what I&#39;m talking about, yes.  what I read is a very specific language encoded with special keys like the periodic table, and common internet slang; and computer science terms for instance in the word &quot;silence&quot; which is pretty sacred according to SOAD you can see Silicon, len for length and &quot;common era&quot; as in the common era lasts only as long as the silence.</p>

<p>controversial, &quot;sea of N&quot; which is a sort of designation of &quot;everyone everywhere&quot; table row (from HTML, frame of reference like a Jeopardy category and you can see it in Tribek) war&#39;s over, &quot;see&quot; Al.</p>

<p>or you could see &quot;ver&quot; and &quot;si&quot; which I take to mean Si on the internet and &quot;ver&quot; on the streets and TV.</p>

<p>What do you mean by “multitude of people with verifiable proof of time travel”? What’s the verifiable proof in that writing?</p>

<p>Just because a word is part of another doesn’t not equate a relationship between the two.</p>

<p>this is a logical fallacy.  meaning this statement is always  wrong.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;English&quot; appearing in &quot;Hebrew&quot; thousands of years before English existed is proof of time travel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The logical fallacy is you assigning a relationship where none exists. </p>

<p>Translations of the old books have included words that did not exist at the time of writing for centuries in all kinds of books. This is not proof of time travel, but proof of modern interpretations of ancient texts. </p>

<p>I’ll grant you the point on your intent when quoting biblical texts. </p>
