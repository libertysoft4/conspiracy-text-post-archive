    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t apologize for wanting to learn!</p>

<p>You&#39;ll get tons of results by just putting the term into a search engine. I guess the problem is which is most reliable. You will develop your own crap detector after a while. </p>

<p>Search 
Media owned by
then CIA at television stations. 
It&#39;s 2 for 1. CIA used msm to put out the narrative they wanted. They got famous, trusted newsman Walter Cronkite to poo poo UFOs.  The information will leap out at you. </p>

<p>A great source of information is blackvault.com - he requested tons of info under the Freedom of Information Act. Great ufo and govt stuff. Also look for 2 ufo researchers i trust - Stanton Friedman and Richard Dolan. Form your own opinion, please.  A great case to research is Rendlesham. Lots there. </p>

<p>MKULTRA was mind control experimenting with drugs and torture. We brought over nazis at the end of WWII, under Operation Paperclip. We let some loose on citizens of the US and Canada. They were eventually exposed in 1975 or so, and Congressional hearings were held. Naturally most of the records were lost. Although they claim the project ended, it just went deeper underground, in a maze of black projects with black budgets. 
This much is out in the open, for your research. </p>

<p>Satanic Ritual Abuse has been laughed at and debunked for years and years. When there is so much effort and time spent debunking and calling people conspiracy theorists, there&#39;s something going on. There are a couple of preschool stories that will make you sick. Dr Colin Ross, a multiple personality specialist, started noticing commonalities in patient stories when speaking with other specialists. Yes, it&#39;s real and happening and goes all the way to the top. 
A search will bring up most of these points. I&#39;m not saying anything new or secret. </p>

<p>The Super Soldier program is fascinating. Look up Duncan Ofinoian or close. His story is chilling and jibes with stories told by others. </p>

<p>Most of this stuff involves torture to produce multiple personalities, which will do as they are told. A famous movie and its remake is the Manchurian Candidate. Watch it and understand that it is not fiction. </p>

<p>You can learn tons about JFK and RFK at black op radio, where there&#39;s a treasure trove of expert info and guests. All shows free for download. </p>

<p>That&#39;s about all I can remember now. If you have specific questions, just ask. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is great, thank you! In terms of the “where to find the info”, of course I could always google (or choose your preferred engine) the topic but I guess the problem I’ve had is finding anything with backing or basis on the claims within it. I will check out blackvault mentioned above though since, from what you have said, seems to have legitimacy behind it! Thanks again for all of this, always love learning about something new </p>

    <div class="md"><p>just so you know this is bullshit the first phrase, is a badly translated mess.</p>

<p>&quot;أخبر&quot; means tell, I don&#39;t know where they got achmed, it&#39;s pronounced achber.</p>

<p>&quot;البحث عن&quot; means look up as in search, plus it missing the object. it&#39;s supposed to be &quot; (something) البحث عن&quot; else you use &quot;البحث&quot; alone.</p>

<p>the translation software must have confused both meanings of &quot;look up&quot; which means most likely that this is fake.</p>

From what I gather, they&#39;re toying with an evolved version of hands-off psychological trauma conditioning similar to what the Gestapo, Stasi, and FBI have done in the past.

    <div class="md"><p>I could show you videos of events that may seem benign or random to you, because you are not sensitized to the stimuli.  Street level harassment such as I have recorded is only one layer of the onion.  Recording the actual frequencies that are capable of altering brain functionality has proven tricky.  For one I&#39;m not certain which types of directed energy are used.  It could be a wide range of EMF(ELF or microwave), silent sound spread spectrum, or scalar waves.  Even if I was certain as to which type of which type of energy is utilized, I&#39;d have to have some idea as to what sort of recording equipment would record it.  Even then, it&#39;s possible that the &quot;beam&quot; of energy is extremely narrow or that the bursts are extremely short.  Oscilloscopes are not cheap.  Extremely sensitive sound recording equipment may not be able to single out the directed energy signal from noise.  How many people do you know who know anything about recording scalar waves?  Add in to the fact that those who conduct these experiments likely gather extremely thorough intelligence on their subjects and can likely damage any equipment that they may buy...you have an extremely difficult crime to detect except to the person who is perceiving the offensive information/psychotronic attack.  It is an extremely expensive, inefficient system, but it does provide something that every megalomaniac on the planet would be interested in: a plausibly deniable weapons system that is extremely difficult to record evidence of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Formula producers make everything they can to set up women to fail breastfeeding (reason: money). &quot;Mommy wars&quot;, &quot;fed is best&quot; and other misinformation, formula given in hospitals, shaming public breastfeeding, &quot;lactation consultants&quot; proposing bottles as a solution to early feeding problems, &quot;support&quot; groups saying things like &quot;it&#39;s ok to give up, you tried&quot;, discouraging practices like co-sleeping (which is known to help breastfeeding) and so on - I believe all are at least supported if not initiated and run by those companies. Bonus points for all the health risks that formula feeding carries, like allergies or diabetes (making Big Pharma happy).</p>
