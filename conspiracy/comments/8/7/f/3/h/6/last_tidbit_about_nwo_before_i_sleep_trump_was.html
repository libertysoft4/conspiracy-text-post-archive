<p>Trump is a game player and grew up close with the mafia and corrupt politicians who had JFK assasinated so you can trust him as far as you can piss. He later claims he was against Gaddafi but when you look behind the smoke screen you realize this was a complete falsehood and he was mad as fuck when Obama helped the Libyan citizens not be victims of genocide at the hands of Gaddafi. His sons who lived through the conflict admitted the evil they had done so don&#39;t pretend that this is some colorful imagination making things up. Good night. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/qa7M2">How Hillary Clinton Lied Her Way to War in Libya.</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Declassified emails released in January and February reveal that Hillary Clinton was one of the main instruments in spreading chaos and extremism in Libya when the U.S. secretary of state personally pushed for the ousting of late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
Hillary Clinton played an integral role in the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi and the destruction of the Libyan nation.  </p>

<p>Clinton’s emails reveal that she and her staff were aware that civilians they claimed to be protecting were not actually in danger from government forces.  </p>

<p>Less than a month ahead of the passage of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973, a resolution which authorized a no-fly zone to protect civilians on March 17, 2011, Hillary&#39;s assistant, Huma Abedin, in an email dated Feb. 21, 2011, stated: “Based on numerous eyewitness reports, it is the Embassy&#39;s assessment that the government no longer controls Benghazi. This is likely the case for Ajdabiyah as well.&quot;  </p>

<p>Abedin went on to write that sources in Benghazi reported that Libyan Interior Minister Abdul Fattah Younes had &quot;changed sides&quot; and was &quot;now with the protesters in Benghazi.&quot; The mood in Benghazi and Ajdabiyah, according to the email, was &quot;celebratory&quot; and all posters of Gadhafi had been “knocked down.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>Crucially, this email was written at a time when Clinton was aware that no government crackdown was taking place in either Benghazi or Ajdabiyah.</strong>  </p>

<p>**This was despite anti-government protests kicking off in Benghazi and Ajdabiyah a few days before, at a time when the U.S. and France and other Western governments were claiming government forces were involved in the mass-killing of protesters and civilians.  </p>

<p><strong>However, on March 2, 2011, a few days before the passage of the U.N. resolution, U.S. State Department official Harriet Spanos sent an email informing Clinton that &quot;Security Reports . . . confirm that Benghazi has been calm over the past couple of days.&quot;</strong>  </p>

<p>“Economic activity is going on in Benghazi,&quot; she added in the email, with shops and banks open and &quot;[m]obile and landline phones… working… and Internet has returned.&quot;  </p>

<p>The moment of truth came 11 days into the NATO bombing, which continued for several months, when Clinton’s top adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, who was not employed by the state department but by the private Clinton Foundation, laid out the reasons for the Washington-led intervention and the eventual ousting of Gadhafi.
Without once mentioning “humanitarian&quot; purposes, in a March 27, 2011 email Blumenthal stressed to Clinton the importance of pressing for a “final win&quot; by ousting Gadhafi in order to boost U.S. President Barack Obama’s then low approval ratings.  </p>

<p>Ousting the Libyan strongman, argued Blumenthal, would further establish “security in North Africa, securing democracy in Egypt and Tunisia, economic development, effect throughout Arab world and Africa, extending U.S. influence, counter-balancing Iran, etc.&quot;
Further highlighting his complete and utter disregard for the human cost of the intervention, in the same email Blumenthal informed Clinton about the horrors committed by U.S.-backed forces in Libya, which included members of al-Qaida.  </p>

<p>&quot;Speaking in strict confidence, one rebel commander stated that his troops continue to summarily execute all foreign mercenaries in the fighting.&quot; Such actions are considered war crimes and in violation of international resolutions and conventions.  </p>

<p>The emails also reveal that the Obama administration and Clinton were aware of the threat of al-Qaida in the eastern part of the country, which had for years been suppressed by the Libyan leader.</p>

<p>The emails also show that claims made by NATO at the time, including alleged atrocities committed by Gadhafi’s forces such as rape and mass killings, were rumors used by Clinton and the Obama administration to help sell the intervention to the world.  </p>

<p>It is clear the NATO intervention was not intended for humanitarian purposes. So what were the intentions of Clinton and the Obama administration? The same as most U.S. interventions: financial interest.  </p>

<p>The emails reveal that most of the intelligence Clinton received on Libya was from Blumenthal, who was preparing to make substantial financial gains from the fall of the Libyan leader.  </p>

<p>According to Vice News, the intel briefs on Libya were “prepared by Blumenthal&#39;s business partner and former CIA operative Tyler Drumheller, a consultant with plans to take advantage of economic opportunities in a post-war Libya.&quot;  </p>

<p>Both men worked with the U.S.-based security company Osprey, a start-up that hoped to profit from medical and military contracts with Libyan rebels amid the chaos of the conflict, according to Vice News.  </p>

<p>Five years later, the opportunism of Clinton and the Obama administration which resulted in one of the most disastrous interventions in recent decades, aiding the rise of extremist groups in the oil-rich African country and contributing to Europe’s ongoing refugee situation can be seen for what it was: a devastating assault on the people of Libya rooted in lies, deceit and narrow, imperial self-interest.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>gaddafi was killed for trying to create a gold backed african currency that would have put an end to americas cheap extraction of resources from the continent. shitlery admitted as much.</p>

<p>now they are in the early stages of forming a continent wide free trade zone, so i guess he didnt die in vain.</p>

<p>gaddafi was no saint but he was overall a positive force for his people and his goal was to basically turn africa in to wakanda, this is why they tried so hard to demonize him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so you just write a couple of emails and boom, you got yourself a little country.  Boy oh boy.  So um, in the event that a country does go belly up, and American interests would be jeoperdized I do believe it would be prudent to have money on hand to keep the lights on.  The taxpayers are not going to foot the bill, we can barely keep our lights on. So private sector investors would need to be in place and why would they commit  dollars unless they see a hefty return on a very high risk investment.  You sure as fuck would not want me and my $5.00 keeping the lights on in some remote oil rich country. And I guess after Bush destabilized the entire region, politically it would be a win win for the democrats if they could go back in time and shut the barn door. So what.  What is your point.?  I do now realize that civics classes are highly underrated.  The complete disregard for the Constitution by this administration and the need for each of two other branches to react to a power grab at any given moment is unprecendented.  His followers just think they can make up the rules as they go along becaue they voted him in.  No some things can never be voted out, Bill of Rights, and amendments to the Constitution, require 3/4 approval of each state, which also must be approved by 3/4 of the voters. It can be just as swift as the Civil Rights Act or, just ask the ERA, decades can pass and Equal Rights for Women are still not the law of the land. Clinton, Obama are no longer in power. Stop the blame game.  The war started by Bush Sr and escalated to an all out land grab by Jr. destabalized that region.  There is no going back in time.  Move forward, shit or get off the pot.  Fucking E-mails.  What about Chenneys millions and miliions of destroyed emails.  How about all those hand written notes from years gone by. Do you really think we have eyes around the globe.  Intel is only reliable as long as it doesn&#39;t change.  Alternate moves, like in chess, must be considered and talked about and notes kept and blah blah blah. It&#39;s when your secretary accidently erases tape recordings, Nixon&#39;s version of emails, just during certain meetings with certain people and only after an investigation is launched can one wonder &quot;conincidence&quot;.  You one tooth wonders can analyze declassified information in a wink of an eye.  Yet keeping a full set of teeth in your damned mouths is not so straight forward or easy to understand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No sir I was referring to your suggestion that all  nations should adopt this practice  as this was the jewel in the crown of social services. Can you imagine taxpayers giving welfare  to couples to have children yet have no say in how children are raised and no minimum amount of training and education and costs for responsibilities  of these people who can but should not be paid because they can’t embrace their roles.</p>

<p>Procreation is the purpose to sustain your species. It’s hard wired for all living things on earth. But only the alpha males are chosen  because they have the superior genes to guarantee the future of the species. Expect human. So just because you are equipped with the abilities doesn’t meant you should use them. It’s not ok to breed with 2nd cousins since share common genes and when paired keeps the species weak is counter productive to make the next generation better than the last. </p>

<p>Encouraging trains to come to the same spot headed in different directions on the same track at full speed is a train wreck</p>
