        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The invention of the internet was one of the most important leaps forward in human history.  The closest historical parallel one can draw, is the invention of the printing press.  In the historical blink of an eye, unlimited information and instantaneous global communication was put at our fingertips.  </p>

<p>The first major signs of the impact on political protests came in the run-up to invasion of Iraq.  The anti-war movement was able to coordinate internationally, and consequently mobilized the largest mass demonstration in human history, with rallies taking place all over the world.  But these were merely the first tremors of the earthquakes that were to come.  By the time the Arab spring broke out, the situation changed dramatically.  Now, even in the ex-colonial world, ordinary people had mobile connections.  The masses could mobilize and coordinate, even without organizations, even without leadership structures, using devices they could carry in their own hands.  Globally, the ruling class was stunned.  Strong dictatorships that stood for decades melted in the fires of revolution.  </p>

<p>Now, a clear and conscious effort is underway to disarm the masses.  The internet is changing.  Social media has changed from an outreach-tool to an echo-chamber.  Net neutrality is being attacked and dismantled.  Our cell phones have become spy networks for corporations and intelligence agencies.  Search engines sensor results.  And your shopping list now stalks you online as ads for anything you briefly feign interest in clog up your browser. </p>

<p>George Orwell predicted exactly this, but he never could have imagined that we would knowingly and willingly carry these spy-devices around with us.</p>

<p>The golden age of the internet is dead.  Welcome to the new reality: a profit-driven, totalitarian control system.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is said every generation and it is proved false every generation. you are so much freer than we were when i was groing up in the 80s, forget about how much freer you are than the 1950s, or perhaps you refer to the draw and quarter age of henry viii? freedoms creep, this is why those who fear it always try to reign it in. they never do.</p>

<p>they tried to kill the printing press. they failed.</p>

<p>the only person who can take away your freedoms is you. that fb was cia was known in 2006, but no one cared except a few of us weirdos,  because it was &quot;fun.&quot; that google would eventually go to the darkside was expected from the beginning, it lasted longer than many of us believed it would.</p>

<p>just stop using the internet, return to analog. we have the capabilities to expand analog beyond the wildest dreams of the pre-digital age.</p>

<p>if you want freedom, do away with representative, republican govt. go to direct democracy.</p>

<p>we got rid of priests, then monarchs, now we  must make the final step and get rid of congresses. stop the cult of personality--ben franklin was not your friend, FDR was not your friend, JFK was not your friend, bernie sanders is not your friend. your friends have all been consigned to obscurity or turned into villains and clowns.</p>

<p>as huey long said, &quot;ain&#39;t nobody ever helped a hick, but a hick hisself.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All good points but you really think that kids right now are going to do that? It seems they&#39;ve mastered brainwashing through the Internet and it&#39;s working quite well on this newest generation. </p>

<p>I work in a restaurant and every single kid(and I&#39;m talking 10 months old) have a 15&quot; iPad that they are glued to. Every single one. I could have 3 kids at my table and all three have their own iPad. I hate being hopeless but I&#39;m actually getting scared for our future. These kids are being programmed from birth. Especially after this weekends march. I&#39;m getting scared. I hate admitting that and it&#39;s hard for me to do. We are one brainwashed generation from becoming china. </p>

<p>While I love your positive outlook I just have a hard time envisioning this youngest generation pulling themselves out of this craved for enslavement. Politicians are just celebrities to them. My country voted someone in because he was young and handsome. There was no hope that Trudeau would do anything positive for Canada. But he was cool so they voted for him. Now he&#39;s piggybacking on American crisis to help pass more Canadian gun laws. My kids will be taught that I&#39;m insane because I like to hunt and enjoy ensuring my personal security. </p>

<p>Please point me in the direction of hope. I&#39;m having a harder and harder time finding it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a 5 year old who gets 1 hour of TV a day and <em>may</em> get her own screem/device  (which counts as her TV time) this summer only because my wife thinks she&#39;ll be <em>behind</em> in kindergarden if she isn&#39;t exposed to it. I don&#39;t think it matters because she&#39;s as quick as a whip but I am surprised I got this far.</p>

<p>The inlaws can&#39;t believe that my 1 year old doesn&#39;t know who Minnie Mouse is because she gets lets screens than her big sister. </p>

<p>Some of us are doing it right. The children you see on the screens described here are lost and you should weep for them, but acknowledge that there are many of us doing it right snd you won&#39;t see us at the restaurant because we cook our own meals and have chickens in the backyard.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s more of us than you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the internet?</p>

<p>yeah, it was great back then, but difficult to use.</p>

<p>if you mean the 90s in general, nope. i was there. the most independent generation to exsist since the 18th century, was (and still is) insukted, belittled, ignored, silenced, bullied, and isolated. but hey, the torch has passed (right over our heads) to millianials who believe personal pronouns are one of the most pressing issues of the age and that hashtags and we the people petitions are really sticking it to the man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, millennials don’t believe those are the most pressing issues. Those things are media distractions from things we actually care about, like degrees costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, property ownership being intangible, wages stagnated since before we were born but inflation continuing to rise, corporations paying less taxes than individuals, and being forced to pay into a social security system that will be bled dry long before we have the potential to benefit from it. </p>

<p>But we’re so glad you’re falling for the trick of blaming the generation after you for societal problems, just like every generation before you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the deep net feels just like the internet did in the 90s. and anonymous and uncensored.  the freedom is palpable and best of all, no corporations. the designs are lean and uncluttered. function reigns above form. despite tor being funded by the us government open source gives a level of oversight and control lost elsewhere.  there is no  javascript, which is a huge privacy risk and would make the whole onion routing pointless. anyone can access and experience it and i encourage everybody to do so.  no need to be afraid of it for being stigmatized. its what we make it.</p>

<p>a good thing about tor that we can still access the regular net having the best of both worlds. and lets not forget there are many up and coming alternatives, i2p, gnunet, netsukuku.</p>

<p>we should be grateful and happy for having choices even in these hard times</p>

<p>the iraq anti-war rallies were not the great beacon you imagine them. they were popular because they were easy, just like that thing that just happened and the pussy cappers etc. what was hard was seattle and WTO, because it was real, because it had consequences, because it would have really changed the world. iraq? psshaw, the iraq war was in service to the WTO and global capitalism. those iraqi anti war protesters? almost to a one ignored or despised seattle. as an aside, the iraqi war mobilizations were nothing like the anti-pershing missle moblizations of 1983.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The American golden age, maybe. The rest of the world is watching. Even so, remember the Silk Road? The lone deep web market, the only one of its kind, seized by authorities. That was not the end of buying dank weed on the internet, but a new beginning. When SR fell, dozens of markets sprang up to take its place. With each failed or phony market that sank, half a dozen more took its place. I think the same is true of the internet. When what know as the internet is finally seized by authorities, dozens of new networks will appear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So build a new internet, or rework it? The creation of the internet was due in part to the desire to share information without restriction. Now that it&#39;s threatened everybody&#39;s giving up. Instead people should be thinking of different ways on how to fight against local and federal corruption. </p>

All kinds of incredible wireless standards and protocols coming out for us to begin to shed our reliance on centralized communication services.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. All you have to do is look at the tsunami of ads among snippets of content that modern web pages have become. Or news &quot;articles&quot; that are literally just a click-bait sentence followed by 10 supporting tweets.</p>

<p>Remember when we thought banner ads were the most horrible thing ever? Now I have a hard time discerning what is supposed to be in the article I&#39;m reading and what is an ad. At least with banner ads it was at the top and you could just scroll a little bit to ignore it. Now I can&#39;t even tell you how many times I&#39;ve gone to a page on my phone only to have the whole thing taken over by a notification that I&#39;ve &#39;won&#39; something on Amazon, and you have no choice but to close the tab because you can&#39;t even go back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I wholeheartedly agree.  Half the links *from actual news networks like NBC and such are pure ads with “content below” that isn’t actually there. </p>

<p>Not to mention that Duck Duck Go does nothing for the fact that search engines are basically useless, if you are looking for information that isn’t on a top 50 most visited sites you are SOL.  Where even 5 years ago, if you wished to get to pages about a topic that were not popular forums or “Instructables” or some other corporate entity, you could skip to page 3 of results.  Now, after the first 15-20 results, there is nothing but ads matching some keywords not even related... or from previous searches.  <strong>When was the last time you can recall searching a topic and getting to some person’s personal web page about it!?</strong></p>

<p>Those pages are out there, but none of the search engines link them.</p>

<p>Now, everything looks and performs like shit. You have to run flash and image blockers, No Script, and all kinds of bullshit extensions and then sit there while your browser and their server duke it out.  It used to be that content loaded first and ads afterwards, now that prioroty is reversed. There are too many platforms for any web content display to be standardized; if it looks good on this device it looks like shit on that device. You spend half of your browser sessions scrolling and moving shit around. Soft paywalls, hard paywalls, intrusive popups on almost every site.....It&#39;s just so over, we need a massive reset.
