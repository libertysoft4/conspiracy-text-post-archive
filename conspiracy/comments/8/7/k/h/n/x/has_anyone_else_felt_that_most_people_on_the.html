        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Maybe this is a reach, but let me try to explain what I&#39;m trying to say. </p>

<p>I discovered Alan Watts and his YouTube lectures about two years ago. Listening to his lectures, I&#39;d become obsessed with his ideas, like how anxiety is an illusion. These lectures drove me to better understand human psychology. They also, naturally, drove me to better understand my own self (after a lifetime of depression and anxiety, I desperately needed this sort of information at this time in my life).</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve had a few breakthroughs in advancing my state of consciousness. Having grown up in a narcissistic household, I naturally became self-centered and pursued my identity&#39;s desires (fame, sex, aesthetics, wealth, power). But, now, I&#39;ve let go of so much of the grasping. I&#39;ve let go of so many attachments, and I can <em>feel</em> how much lighter and more peaceful I&#39;ve become. I can <em>feel</em> that letting go is ultimately what guides us to remembering who we really are. So, Alan Watts has guided me to a sort of existential clarity, through which I have seen into my true, quiet, honest nature.</p>

<p>Now, having let go a lot, I lost all sense of motivation to go out and experience society. I fell in love with nature and music, but a part of me has just wanted to remain separate from society. However, as I discovered Alan Watts, I also discovered conspiracies. My internal awakening came hand-in-hand with my &#39;awakening&#39; of the true(r) state of reality (truer than I used to think, at least...). As we, in this sub, are aware, mankind desperately needs to take <em>responsibility</em> if we truly want to fix this crappy and depressive state of the world. Unfortunately, I feel that many people are &#39;awakening&#39; consciousness and are simply floating through the world like ghosts, rather than letting go and then restructuring your ego/life in a way that makes you a utility for humanity&#39;s change in the positive direction. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. Maybe this is a shot in the dark, or, at the very least, a stretch. But I just wanted to see if anyone has thought this way, and if you have, I&#39;m curious if you&#39;ve done any extensive research on this. </p>

<p>Yeah, that seems to happen to a lot of us. You don&#39;t want to participate in the systems anymore. Going to the grocery store is a chore now &gt;.&gt; Even more than it was before!</p>

<p>We can probably agree that everyone has a different purpose in life, be it known or not. Not everyone is interested or skillful in the same stuff as others. Some will be engineering and some will be music. In the current world/system, the engineer should do alright and provides for society. The musician/producer might not as much yet he provides beautiful art.</p>

<p>Now, some of the wandering souls you see might not know <em>what</em> they are meant for or what their skills are used for.</p>

<p>I think I fall into this, I&#39;m a mediocre coder and that&#39;s all I&#39;ve known for now but it pays the bill and it&#39;s not too hard and I get to keep up to date with the world. Despite that, I don&#39;t feel the need to find another job or vocation. I do feel however that whatever my skills are for, is not available to me yet and that it will present itself in due time. Is this lazy? I&#39;d say no because this is what my gut is telling me. </p>

<p>As for taking responsibility for the world, don&#39;t put too much weight on your own shoulders as your position probably means you can&#39;t change much, vs example, big players such as world leaders</p>

<p>Considering the degree of misinformation that exists nowadays, both regarding what the world literally is and what we self-aware parts literally are, the only conclusion I can draw from the question, &quot;Who or what should I listen to, right now, in terms of being guided to truth?&quot; is that the individual <em>should only listen to his own heart</em>. Certainly, seek more information to absorb, if your heart wants you to. But, at the end of the day, the reason existence is so beautiful and the reason we should all be perpetually grateful just to <em>be</em> is because, no matter how dark and confusing things get, the individual can <em>always</em> look within and follow the heart, the internal flame.</p>

<p>The only &#39;issue&#39; I have is...I&#39;m someone who came from a wealthy background, went to an elite university, have powerful connections, but, one day, I saw through the entire thing. I recognized ego in <em>everyone</em> I&#39;d surrounded myself with. No one was living organically, no one was true. So, I literally quit my job and moved across the world to a significantly less populated area of the world (I moved in with snowmandan, haha). I say all this because, part of me feels shame for not utilizing my connections and demographic as a pedestal to develop power. I know that, from a position of power, I could help change the world, from a stoic and conscious perspective. At the same time, however, I am in my late 20s, still coping with letting go, still just want to make music, and am completely broke. Yet, my heart throbs with pain just from knowing that the world is burning, and all I&#39;m really pursuing is letting go and learning the guitar. With all that said, I&#39;m someone who is outstandingly hard on himself, so my &#39;concern&#39; here might be ridiculous.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, Ray. </p>

<p>Damn right.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yep, what your gut might have been telling you for months in the back of your head, with enough information collected, might become obvious that the correct answer was what your gut was telling you about.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But the fight is not about power though</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s how we get suicided too though :/</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m mid 20s and in no situation to help better the world really except small dumb ways. I can make no impact in my current situation, even when looking into the future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet, my heart throbs with pain just from knowing that the world is burning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, we now see in how bad a position we are, but things are changing, parts are moving, that&#39;s for certain.</p>

<p>They say that, everything happens for a reason and that there are no coincidences. Well, from my point of view, a lot of us are eager to <em>do something</em>. Frankly, I&#39;m tired as all hell with the 9 to 5 writing code to make forms and reports. Fuck that life mate.</p>

<p>But what can <em>I</em> do? Nothing except wait, because the big players on the board have already all been chosen and it is playing out in Act 1. I believe a lot of us are Act 2.</p>

<p>Once we throw the system to the ground, think about the chaos that might erupt from that, people will not know what do to. Well you, me and other &quot;crazy conspiracy theorists&quot; are gonna stick out like a sore thumb in this chaos, we&#39;ll be kind of lighthouses in that situation.</p>

<p>So I guess the tl;dr is keep red pilling as we go and wait for your role in Act 2.</p>

<p>In these fast changing times, this week can look very different to the next one.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s everywhere, even if we don&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>I mean, imagine yourself going back a year and telling anyone that Saudi Arabia was on its way to let women drive, are talking about perhaps loosening laws around the hijab and all those things, building an opera for music, signed with the WWE for 10 years, are in talks with Russia to give them oil for 10-20 years instead of 1-2 and they even now have women in high ranking functions of the government ?</p>

<p>I try my best. In the current system I can&#39;t achieve much, nor is my gut telling me to. I&#39;m in some kind of wait/idle mode. </p>

<p>So meanwhile I just collect as much info as I can. I don&#39;t know what my real, actual skills are, or what they are practically used for.</p>

<p>So far I&#39;m good at collecting info and making conclusions, so I guess I wait and see if it all comes true haha. To the annoyance of my roommate :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Realized that, too. So, then, I ask, &quot;Why is that too much effort for most?&quot; Well, what is effort? Effort is the willing expenditure of energy. Why does no one want to expend their energy, these days? Because we are lazy. What does it mean to be lazy? It means that one is resisting responsibility, almost always due to fear. So, our collective has massive problems because we&#39;ve elected to overlook the value of taking responsibility for one&#39;s self. </p>

<p>Why? Because taking responsibility means change. Change implies that the ego, or the identity, has to let go of what it once thought it was. Most of us have built our sense of self upon the bullshit illusion that we are &#39;special&#39; individuals, so it becomes obvious why most people, particularly baby boomers and millennials (I&#39;d imagine), are refusing to let go and take responsibility. There&#39;s so much clinging to comfort because of fear.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all fear. If we let go of attachment, fear would dissipate into silence, and we&#39;d finally come together, honestly acknowledge the Earth&#39;s broken-heart, and we&#39;d do everything in our power to put the world back together. Hopefully, that&#39;s what&#39;s coming. </p>

<p>i feel a lot of us go into sleeper cell mode... when the universe needs us we get the call and spring to action.</p>

<p>in the meantime enjoy your ride, and be thankful you have found some peace, compared to the poor slaves on the treadmill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most energetic forces in this reality are fear and Love. The Truth will show you how to exit this maze we are in, Love will shine a light so you don&#39;t need to stumble too much. Fear will use anything to distract you while trust and knowledge can teach you how to use the power of forgiving to the bennefit of you and All.</p>

<p>Be the change you want to see, lead by example and people will follow you on their own if your example resonates with Truth and Love. And please don&#39;t forget to be Honest to yourself, we all have the tools we need to evolve within ourselves already, now it is time to learn how to use them, find some answers and create a better life for ourselves and All.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I very much resonate with this. I really came to depise the &quot;nothing matters and nothing is real crew&quot;. I think there is the awakening period of everything is &quot;love and Light&quot; to reality hitting home that &quot;I still need to pay my bills and live this life&quot;. After exiting the matrix for a few years, I re-entered knowing that I am having to do both - make a living whilst being the change. I am glad others feel the same. It is not over until it is over. So fuck, realise that you have a piece to play and play the game. Isn&#39;t that why we came?</p>

<p>The rulers of this world never though the pawns had it in them to actually be real players. Let us show them what we are made of an rewrite the rules of the game completely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really appreciate where your head is at. I think you&#39;ve grounded yourself with an optimistic and shameless perspective. I also think you&#39;re accurate with the whole Act 1, Act 2 thing. I guess I&#39;ll just keep on keeping on, and I&#39;ll remain vigilant for the time when people like you and I are called to whatever action we can take to do what we know needs to be done. I&#39;m sure that, in time, all of our directions will become more and more clear. </p>
