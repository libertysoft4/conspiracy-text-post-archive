        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In all the recent controversy about Facebook, this is something I&#39;ve seen discussed very little. The revelations about Cambridge Analytica were hardly shocking to those of us who&#39;ve long been calling out the risks of giving out personal data like Halloween candy to all these third-party apps. It&#39;s good to see people wising up, but you&#39;ve got to wonder, why now? And why Facebook specifically?</p>

<p>&quot;Fake news&quot;, echo chambers, data-mining, privacy breaches, and other problems with social media are common to practically all platforms. But one of the main reasons many of us are reluctant to give up Facebook entirely is its incredible usefulness and broad reach for organizing events -- everything from private parties to public protests. No other social media site even comes <em>close</em> to Facebook in terms of event planning and organizing. Unless something else fills that gap and attracts similar numbers, decimating Facebook&#39;s userbase -- and even just making users more wary of political engagement on Facebook -- would greatly diminish public activism against injustice, war, authoritarian overreach, etc.</p>

<p>I hesitate to defend Facebook, because the platform does have a ton of problems. But I think it&#39;s important that we critically analyze why Facebook is being singled out from the crowd, and <em>why now.</em> If nothing else, maybe we can take measures to ensure that public activism isn&#39;t a casualty of taking a stand for digital privacy.</p>

In fact Google has put forward features explicitly allowing you to block specific apps from having access to specific things.

    <div class="md"><p>so wait, yesterday everyone thinks Facebook is a tool of the govenment for data collection and now its the government against facebook so that people cant organize??</p>

<p>The whole Cambridge thing was an abuse of a &quot;feature&quot;. That feature being that you can see the data of &quot;friends of friends&quot;. Therefore, gaining enough friends will essentially give you access to viewing the <strong>publicly</strong> posted information of just about anyone. </p>

<p>This isnt a breach, or a hack or even a loss. It was a poorly designed feature that was abused. And what seems to be more of the real issue was how facebook handled it when it was brought to their attention (spoiler alert, they did nothing). </p>

<p>Just bothers me that everyone is trying to talk about this like FB violated peoples personal data. Thats not quite right. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not defending anything Facebook has or will do, but its important to understand what exactly happened. </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t an either/or proposition. It can be both: the government and corporate interests have been harvesting data unethically wherever they can get it, but also have a problem with how effectively Facebook has been used by grassroots activists against their interests. That could partially explain why they seem to be trying to burn this bridge now after exploiting it for so long.</p>

<p>These are supposed to be just for marketing and in some cases authentication but I think it&#39;s fair to say at this point that you can&#39;t take their word for that.</p>

<p>If you want some insight into what they develop and what kinds of projects they have a hand in, check their public developer blog.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll soon realize the amount of knowledge and power Facebook has compared to their competition such as Twitter or Snapchat.</p>

<p>It can&#39;t be compared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are several reasons why Facebook is being blamed for Trump.</p>

<p>The most important one is Hillary and her puppet masters absolutely want to sink Zucc from ever running for President. I have no evidence but I bet if Hillary and Podesta&#39;s emails got hacked again and dumped on Wikileaks that we&#39;d see them calling in favors with their media @surrogates&quot; and orchestrating a full court press to destroy Zucc&#39;s reputation to make everyone hate him even more to ensure he can&#39;t ever be the Democrat nominee for President.</p>

<p>Second, Team Hillary needs a convenient excuse for why she lost that does not require the Democrat party to go on a soul searching walkabout to re-find themselves to re-orient the direction of the vector of their gumbo stew platform into a coherent narrative and to re-connect with the traditional Leftist base, such as the pro-Labor and anti-War hippies.
But Crooked Hillary&#39;s Democrat Party is now the party of Wall St and Regime Change and Off-Shoring and promoting bizarre and alienating fringe demographics like Gender-Fluid Otherkins.</p>

<p>Crooked Hillary will do anything to evade the spotlight focusing on her crimes and the Clinton Foundation&#39;s bribery and money kaundering, so if that means poor robotic Zucc has to take the fall then so be it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel bad for Zucc. Fuck him and fuck Facebook. Zucc personally destroyed the www by turning Silicon Valley into a Casino and turning the Internet into an Orwellian Nightmare, so I hope Crooked Hillary goes all the way in blaming him and eventually forcing him to resign from Facebook.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a calculated move from the big finance (who has deep ties with MSM) to acquire FB at a low price</p></li>
