<p>Bad news for regimes and good news for revolutionaries eh?”</p>

<p>This is for any interested in the High Level Insider anon. </p>

<p><sup>^</sup> Is something the anon first said when we discovered they had Alts on Reddit. I didn’t really understand the significance at the time. This was just after the election and it was difficult to see how the “Right” were doing anything other than basking in their victory. “The Left” weren’t doing much more than casting aspersions on his  unbecoming conduct and inexperience. 
Fast forward 1 year. Enough policies have been passed for everyone to see Trumps more of the same. Military spending increased $54B. Cabinet filled with Goldman Sachs and SkullnCrossbones. Unwavering support for Israel. Cambridge Analytica &amp; Facebook.</p>

<p>Trump provides a nexus point into conspiracy research that other presidents simply cannot match. Short of Bill Clinton and his chequered past as Arkansas Governor (Major cocaine trafficking interspersed with sanctioned Murders), it’s difficult to remember a president with such a tailwind of controversy. (Obamas CIA past still hasn’t entered the public conversation, but that’s a post for another time..)</p>

<p>Trump might be the best thing to ever happen to the world. Remember the story of the emperors new clothes?</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A vain emperor hires weavers who promise him they will make him the best suit of clothes. The weavers are con-men who convince the emperor they are using a fine fabric invisible to anyone who is either unfit for his position or &quot;hopelessly stupid&quot;. The con lies in that the weavers are actually only pretending to manufacture the clothes; they are making make-believe clothes which they mime. Thus, no one, not even the emperor nor his ministers can see the alleged &quot;clothes&quot;, but pretend that they can for fear of appearing unfit for their positions, and the emperor does the same. &gt;&gt;Finally, the weavers report that the suit is finished, they mime dressing him, and the emperor marches in procession before his subjects. The townsfolk go along with the pretense, not wanting to appear unfit for their positions or stupid. Then, a child in the crowd, too young to understand the desirability of keeping up the pretense, blurts out that the emperor is wearing nothing at all, and the cry is taken up by others. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Along with shaping opinion through the dispersion of accepted narratives, the media plays an important role in maintaining the status quo through its control of “common knowledge” - knowing what everyone else knows.
If you think others will fear or ridicule your beliefs, you’re far likely to not say anything. People generally want to be accepted and not viewed as radically different to their peers. But if you know other people likely share the same views as you, the mental block is gone and open discussion can take place. The internet has made it difficult for the media to continue providing this function to those who rule over us. Cue net neutrality. Voting bots... Cambridge Analytica..</p>

<p>It won’t work though. <a href="http://www.wowzone.com/monkey.htm">The tipping point has already been reached.</a>
The crowd is pointing. Sniggers can be heard.</p>

<p>Soon we’ll all be laughing at just how stupid we were to have ever bought their bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. So we agree they’ll research ones that suit them?</p>

<p>Cambridge Analytica has tendrils that stretch from the political spectrum in America, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/26/pressure-grows-on-pm-over-brexit-cambridge-analytica-scandal-theresa-may">to the Brexit- UKs decision to leave the EU</a>. Purely because it suits them of course, these partisan hacks are learning exactly how corrupt the system is - some will ignore  no doubt, blissful in their ignorance..</p>

<p>but some won’t.. </p>

<p>And these are the people I’m talking about. 9/11 was my alarm clock to awaken. After which I spent years alienating myself from my friends and family as I desperately sought to convince them of the truth. I learnt people can only come to when it’s their time. Major fuckeries aid in that journey due to the research potential within  information that consequently enters the public domain. To that end, there’s never been anything quite like Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As mentioned in the post, It’s a mistake to think what you see in the media reflects actual opinion. Even events that suggest this to be true are often contrived - manufactured protests designed for exactly that purpose.
How many times have we seen stories about paid protesters or actual evidence of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dz470/most_reddit_addicted_city_over_100k_visits_total/">government astroturfing?</a> 
All of these are tactics to make you think the majority have arrived at a consensus on a given issue. It’s hard enough to be heard in a crowd, harder still when  that crowd doesn’t agree with you.
The illusion of consent is what allows governments to do things people don’t agree with.</p>
