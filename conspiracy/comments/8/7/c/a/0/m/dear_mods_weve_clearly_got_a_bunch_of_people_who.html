<p><em>Everyone</em> in r/conspiracy knows this. The people claiming the contrary are <em>intentionally disrupting</em> by claiming this. They want to get people on the defensive when they discuss the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j1y5la6q&amp;amp;sh=75667764">proven conspiracy</a> of widespread shilling online.</p>

If it were just us agreeing with each other we&#39;d get bored and leave. We don&#39;t need closed-minded people coming here to try to gaslight us, divert our attention and bury valuable comments. We need other open-minded people who already understand that conspiracies not only exist but the world literally operates on them.

<p>Under the status quo, shills completely overrun every comment section, the regular users have fled or become suspicious that anyone else could just be another shill wasting their time.</p>

<p>This straw man really needs to be specifically added to the rules as a bannable offense.</p>

<p>&quot;No user may, without explicit evidence to the contrary, accuse another user of wanting a safe space when they discuss the proven conspiracy of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j1y5la6q&amp;amp;sh=75667764">shills</a> and the methods used by shills. Because shilling has reached emergency levels and is affecting the ability of users to freely exchange ideas without harassment, there will be zero tolerance, and all violations will result in a ban.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a mod takeover that occurred in mid 2017 that ended up being the nail in the coffin.</p>

<p>After the new mods were settled in they opened the flood gates to a bunch of users who are not concerned with truth-seeking and come here for no other reason than to disrupt, divide, and distract.</p>

<p>I just saw a fucking Vanity Fair article posted with absolutely no commentary, just a title that is literally EXACTLY the same as the title of the article. Fucking VANITY FAIR!!!! What??!?</p>

<p>Mods, if you’re reading this, here are a few simple ways to improve this sub immensely:</p>

<p>1) Do not allow users to post links to MSM articles without adding commentary or the purpose for posting it to the sub. (And no, submission statements do not count. I shouldn’t have to scroll through the comment section to be able to read what the original poster was thinking when they posted their content. Half of the time the OP is parroting the viewpoint of the posted content)</p>

<p>2) Do not allow users to title their post using the same verbiage as the title of the content being posted. (As in, don’t use the same title as the shitty WashingtonPost article you’re being paid to post here).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, I consider something to be MSM if it gets the majority of it’s revenue from selling advertising. Selling advertising is the main source of revenue for almost all mainstream media outlets. This, by definition, means that truth and accuracy in reporting take second priority to profit. </p>

<p>Is it that hard to understand? I think it’s pretty simple. All of it works together, and the way we’re told it works is all just a cute little fairytale that has no grounds in reality. I truly believe that our Democracy is a farce and has been for more than a century. </p>

<p>Governments do not control the people of the world. Evil, money and greed control governments AND their people. </p>

<p>My point is that posting an MSM article and not providing an opinion about it is lazy and unimaginative. It should be banned. There are too many posts that are nothing more than links to MSM articles with titles that parrot the article. It’s just incredibly, <em>incredibly</em> obnoxious. If I wanted to read Vanity Fair I would go to their god damn website.</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s still bad when they do it. So you&#39;re not really hurting the discussion by telling people they can&#39;t use fallacious logic, right? But it would clean up 90% of our problems in the comments section, because we know almost all of the shills are incapable of actually proving their point, right?</p>

<p>Not bad, but now you&#39;ve got to spend a bunch of mod time digging through histories before you can get enough evidence to make a good judgment call, right? Ratio of shills to mods is too high, unless you&#39;re going to double the size of the mod team or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;normal voting patterns&quot;
There is no such thing. Some articles suck, others are intriguing. Sometimes people get angry about something and vote on it more than usual. Subs gain and lose followers with differing values. Just because they people here are upvoting things you don&#39;t like doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a concerted effort to attack you. Plus, mods don&#39;t have access to the logs, so you would have no way of knowing if something was brigaded or not other than gut feeling. All this leads to is mods removing content they disagree with. If the community actually felt that something was being manipulated artificially, then either move to a platform where upvotes aren&#39;t anonymous, or figure a different way to prove it. All it sounds like at this point is whining that the sub doesn&#39;t agree with you.</p>

<p>McCarthy was <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2000/02/4020/">vindicated</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using new information obtained from studies of old Soviet files in Moscow and now the famous Venona Intercepts — FBI recordings of Soviet embassy communications between 1944-48 — the record is showing that McCarthy was essentially right. He had many weaknesses, but almost every case he charged has now been proven correct. Whether it was stealing atomic secrets or influencing U.S. foreign policy, communist victories in the 1940s were fed by an incredibly vast spy and influence network.</p>

<p>The real story is that there were British triple agents on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Five">both sides</a>, playing the US and the Russians against each other to maintain British hegemony. Speaking of which, who did Christopher Steele work for?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, propaganda exists. But what is propaganda other than arguments and ideas? It isn’t witchcraft or wizardry. It isn’t going to melt your face like that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark; you can engage it rationally without plugging your fingers in your ears and screaming “propaganda!” In the event that the ideas you are debating against online are indeed the product of government deception, you should be able to debunk them using truth and rationality. If there are lies, point them out using truth and facts. If there are half-truths, bring in the other half of the equation. If there are bad arguments relying on bad thinking, refute them with good arguments and good thinking. The methods of refuting propaganda are the same as the methods of refuting anything else, so it’s stupid to act like plugging your fingers in your ears and screaming “propaganda” is a legitimate tactic.</p>

<p>The difference is there&#39;s a mountain of evidence supporting the Trump allegations and Deep State is simply being used to deflect from actual facts.  If someone disagrees with Trump, they are part of the Deep State.  No evidence required, just wild allegations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The deep state narrative is a new construct.  It references the theories of the illuminati and other secret cabals pulling the strings of society.  They arent the same thing.  The deep state narrative is being used to attack people who are critical of Trump or disagree with his policies.  They are typically empty allegations with no factual basis.  For instance, the wild and crazy claim that Obama and Hillary are somehow controlling this deep state with George Soros and his bottomless checkbook.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a form of neo-McCarthyism meant to marginalize those who oppose this administration.  It&#39;s also being used to distract, deflect and discredit any factual information that is critical or implicates Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix was meeting with Corey Lewandowski, soon to be Trump&#39;s campaign manager, in the spring of 2015, before Trump announced his candidacy and while Cambridge Analytica was still working for Ted Cruz&#39;s campaign, Wylie said. And in 2014, &quot;we were testing all kinds of messages and all kinds of imagery — that included images of walls, people scaling walls, we tested &#39;drain the swamp,&#39; testing ideas of the &#39;deep state,&#39;&quot; he added. &quot;And a lot of these narratives, which at the time would have seemed crazy for a mainstream candidate to run on, those were the things that we were finding that there were pockets of Americans who this really appealed to. And Steve Bannon knew that, because we were doing the research on it. And I was surprised when I saw the Trump campaign and it started, you know, talking about building walls or draining the swamp.&quot;&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mike Lofgren of course is a former GOP congressional aide who calls this derivation Deep State 2.0, targeted mainly at liberals and liberal policymakers.  It&#39;s a re-framing of the narrative.</p>

<p>So its certainly being popularized by the right wing.  We all know a Continuity of Government Plan exists, but there&#39;s absolutely no evidence Obama and Hillary are in cahoots with George Soros to foment some kind of deep state led coup against Trump.  It has been used to attack anyone that doesn&#39;t toe the Trump line.  It&#39;s become a vehicle to rehash Clinton conspiracies from the last 30 years that were also never proven.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a narrative being used to attack the opposition or to deflect and distract from actual facts implicating Trump.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your source mentions noting about that, in fact the word falsified doesn&#39;t even come up in that article.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your source does say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The report was outlined last week by the panel&#39;s top Russia investigator, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said it would <strong>confirm the intelligence community&#39;s finding that Russia interfered in the 2016 election</strong> but break from the agencies&#39; conclusion that the Kremlin preferred a Trump victory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the HIC agrees that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, they do not agree with the intelligence agencies that Russia tried to help Trumps campaign.</p>

<p>So nothing in you said in your original comment is true.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t take much of what the Republicans are doing in the HIC as faithful. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/house-intel-committee-didnt-complete-russia-investigation-before-ending-it-2018-3">Report alleges the House Intelligence Committee failed to investigate a stunning number of leads before closing its Russia investigation</a></p>

<p>Mueller will be deciding factor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of those ridiculous narratives that are far too heavily supported in a great sub like r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>The usual conspiracy about investigators -- take the Warren Commission for example, or the 9-11 Commission -- is that they are too friendly to the objects of the investigation and the final report is a white wash.</p>

<p>The idea that Robert Mueller is an &quot;enemy&quot; or a &quot;criminal&quot; perverts this whole idea. It doesn&#39;t matter who Robert Mueller is -- except that he is not a crony. That&#39;s how investigations work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No... it’s definitely a narrative being pushed. And yes, the president is under criminal investigation. </p>

<p>But you see, the truly perceptive and intelligent person sees that our media and politicians work together to create a charade (much like theatre) to distract us from what really matters, and from discovering real truth.</p>

<p>In short, if it’s being reported by the mainstream media, it’s not a conspiracy but rather a story that they want you to believe.</p>

<p>The MSM is the mouthpiece of the powers that be. The sooner you realize that and tune out, the better off our nation will be.</p>

<p>I think Trump is smarter than you think. I mean, he is the president of the United States. You are not. </p>

<p>I think Trump won because people were tired of the same old establishment-career politicians pushing the same lies. It’s pretty easy for anyone who took the time to research Clinton’s political career to tell that she is basically a Republican pretending to be a Democrat. Pretty much everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie. She is not “progressive” even in the slightest degree. She also said “It’s my turn to be president”. I can’t respect anyone who would vote for a candidate that said that...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can’t find your actual quote anywhere from Hillary. I see a report of a Samuel Rosales-Avila supposedly having an interview with her, where she said this, but I can’t find any actual content from this reporter other than the quote. I’m not ready to call it fake news yet, but I would think I would be able to find an article or video that he published etc. Do you have a link that you trust with that info? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. I followed the campaign pretty closely and didn’t ever hear of that, other than the meme that was floating around. I’m surprised that didn’t get picked up by FOX or Breitbart as that would be a pretty easy attack for them to put together. If you can track it down I would love to hear it. I’ve been up and down the internet and can’t find it (I even searched T_D and HillaryForPrison to no avail). </p>

<p>As for the Samuel Rosales-Avila story I’m pretty convinced that was fake news. Between looking for your video and trying all my Google fu to verify any reporter from La Habra with that name, I literally can find nothing on that persons existence. Every story that has a link for further info just has the same copy and pasted article after the link or a 404’d message. I do not bring this up to Cast doubt on your story or change your opinion in any way. I just thought it was an interesting rabbit hole. </p>

<p>That&#39;s precisely what they did, by implying that everyone who talks about the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j1y5la6q&amp;amp;sh=75667764">proven fact of shilling</a> is somehow just a whiny bitch that can&#39;t handle people disagreeing with them.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay that is a definite baseless shill accusation. Yikes. You are really treading on thin ice here buddy. My buddy CIAsellsDrugs swings a mean ban hammer and I’m going to let him know all the mistakes you’ve made. He takes this stuff really seriously. </p>

<p>Ok. Seriously. Sorry. </p>

<p>I’ll admit, I’m being pretty petty here, so I’ll stop. I know you won’t, but hopefully you can see how easily the same ‘rules’ you are spouting can be used against anyone. You are littering this thread with your high and mighty gatekeeping and trigger happy ban finger accusations. Nobody is saying shills don’t exist, despite your attempts to say so. They are saying when you include the phrase MSM narrative it seems like you are not worried about shills as much as opposing viewpoints (since nobody cared when it was Benghazi, Emails, or Fast and Furious). Shills are a genuine problem. So are people trying to silence discussion of popular conspiracies. To you that nuance isn’t important, to others it is very important. You both belong here. </p>

<p>My apologies for using words against you, you seem stressed and at the least passionate about this issue, but your criteria seemed to be lacking so I had hoped a little ‘I’m rubber, you’re glue’ would help put things in perspective.  </p>

<p>&quot;Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can’t do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how ‘sensitive they are to criticism.’&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if you know you have bias, how do you really know for certain that the left wing conspiracies you dont believe in arent true and how do you know the right wing ones you do believe in are true?  How do you know if youre just not confirming your bias? And if you are just confirming your bias, how do you know your bias is even true?  You seem like a reasonable person and would probably admit there is no way you are correct about everything. If you know you are not correct about everything and that, logically, you must be wrong about something, how do you know what you are right about and what you are wrong about?  The short answer is, you dont.  So if you dont know what youre right about and what youre wrong about, how do you have any opinions or beliefs about anything?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pizzagate has no evidence and is built upon an entirely backward hypothesis -- that HRC did it for political reasons. As we can see from places like this sub, the propagation of &quot;Evil Hillary&quot; killing Seth worked against HRC at the most convenient time right before the election. A valid hypothesis would be to say that Donald Trump or his supporters had Seth killed to both make HRC look &quot;evil&quot; and to provide a dead scapegoat for whoever really released the emails. This conspiracy makes sense.</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;liberal&quot; media has always been BS, but somehow the notion has staying power. It is corporate. It is not just corporate and not just consolidated into six conglomerates, it is much more. The big media companies are all controlled out of the center of financial power, London. We can tell just by looking at the institutional investors. Nearly every major corporation is controlled by about two dozen entities, media companies included. This is the big corporate conspiracy, and its out in the open. Just go look at who has controlling shares: holding companies like AXA, State Street, Bank of America, Barclay&#39;s, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>What Podesta conspiracies work for you? Anything big? He&#39;s out of power by the way. In a place like here where we often here things like &quot;both parties are the same&quot; or &quot;TPTB always get their way,&quot; we cannot also say that by some magical fluke of our false big picture notion that John Podesta&#39;s chosen candidate lost the election, and that somehow, he is pulling the strings from behind the curtain after such a colossal failure. It just doesn&#39;t work at all.</p></li>
<li><p>This one&#39;s good. As studies have shown, Donald Trump&#39;s supporters have something in common -- they are authoritarians.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>With the exception of Massachusetts, those states with the bad exit polls in the primaries seem to all be Republican controlled states.</p>

<p>In Republican controlled states, Republicans control the voting apparatus even for the primaries. This is important to know because if there are significant statistical anomalies, then they would have occurred under Republican control.</p>

<p>In other words, if these primary elections were stolen, it could well be Republicans that stole them.</p>

<p>Now for a little history. The Counterpunch article uses a source called Brennan Center. If you go to its site, you will find that Republicans have been cheating in elections routinely since 2002, after the Grand Theft of the 2000 election. So, Republicans have the will and the ability and the demonstrated track record of cheating on elections.</p>

<p>Now for a hypothesis as to why Republicans would cheat for Hillary: it&#39;s obvious. Bernie Sanders was well ahead of Hillary his match against Donald Trump. By cheating for Hillary in the primaries, Republicans would have a better chance of getting Donald Trump through the election.</p>

<p>Except the Republican Party didn&#39;t want Trump. They wanted Jeb, Cruz, or even Kasich over Trump. But I have no doubt the establishment Republicans would try to steal an election for Hillary.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t. He was considered tolerable at best, but then it got out of control. Now they&#39;ve gone full retard and are trying to impeach a guy who was going to generally leave things alone, and now he&#39;s actively pursuing a swamp-draining program.

<p>There you go believing what &quot;they&quot; tell you without question. This is r/conspiracy dammit. Look at the facts!</p>

<p>It was so obvious that Donald Trump was going to win the primaries right from the beginning that TPTB sold us an &quot;emperor&#39;s new clothes&quot; level lie ... that they didn&#39;t want Donald Trump.</p>

<p>If they didn&#39;t want Donald Trump, the corporate media would not have given him billions in free coverage.</p>

<p>If they didn&#39;t want Donald Trump, the big donors like Koch and Mercer would have told a whole bunch of candidates to drop out so that Donald Trump has some real competition.</p>

<p>But no, they gave out all that free advertising and they were fine with running 18 candidates against Donald Trump. They assured his win in the primaries.</p>

<p>Then, they took their most discredited neocon types, and had them endorse Hillary Clinton to make sure that she looked like the Establishment.</p>

<p>TPTB got to you big time. The result is deconstruction or society, cutting off healthcare, giant tax cuts mostly for the rich, more military buildup, etc. All the same things RONALD REAGAN and the BUSHES did. You were fooled.</p>

<p>Look at who Trump has taken regular meetings with since he took office- Henry Kissinger. Even Obama didn’t meet with him.</p>

<p>Then look at his picks, Goldman Sachs, Exxon, other wealthy CEOs etc. </p>

<p>There’s some infighting at the top so he’s allowed a few wins. The only thing that does make me wonder is the fact that he bombed the opiom fields in Afghanistan. </p>

<p>I just think western countries elections at the moment could be easily won by anybody framed as antiestablishment in terms of wanting to kick out the career politicians rather than someone wanting to bring down the system </p>

<p>BCCI investigation as reported by the failing New York Times in 1991.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now the fight among investigators is coming out into the open. Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who gave impetus to long-contained probes, told a Senate subcommittee headed by Senator John Kerry that he is getting no cooperation from the Thornburgh Justice Department.</p>

<p>Justice&#39;s Criminal Division chief, Robert Mueller, tells me he will have a hatchet-burying session with the independent-minded D.A. next week, and vehemently denies having told British intelligence to stop cooperating with the Manhattan grand jury.</p>

<p>BCCI was the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a dirty offshore bank that then-president Ronald Reagan&#39;s Central Intelligence Agency used to run guns to Hussein, finance Osama bin Laden, move money in the illegal Iran-Contra operation and carry out other &quot;agency&quot; black ops. The Bushes also benefited privately; one of the bank&#39;s largest Saudi investors helped bail out George W. Bush&#39;s troubled oil investments.</p>

<p>Can a democrat actually hold democratic views without being a shill?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say that&#39;s a good representation of my journey. I&#39;ve got significant gripes with Dem leadership. To my mind there is a jaw dropping integrity problem at play, and the daily outrage are distractions to ride it out without any accountability for clear ethics issues on display. Generally I&#39;m yelled at, labeled, name called, shamed, blocked, and in general meet ad hominem and name calling attacks when arguing points on the issue.</p>

<p>So I find myself working with Trump supporters more often than not, and DJT grows on me as a result. There are good people out there. The mental barriers of treating politics as a &#39;team sport&#39; are reduced by the strategies being deployed these days. At some point you become conditioned to simply ignore the outrage and speak your mind without caring what the response may be. Am I going to be called mean names again? Boo-hoo. I hear it every day.</p>

It <em>is</em> demonstratively true that Democrats and Republicans have a monopoly (or more accurately, a duopoly) on power. It does not <em>have</em> to logically follow that they therefore must be the same. It is perfectly possible for two hypothetical parties to be highly opposite, and yet mutually recognize that they stand to benefit greatly from coordinated effort to exclude any other parties from power. </p>

<p>Also, just saying &quot;both are the same&quot; is too vague to be usefully correct, since there are many issues they differ on dramatically. What you actually mean, I am sure, is that they are both similar in respect to certain prevailing aspects - such as the desire to control public narratives, dominate control over political power, and level of self and elite interest over public benefits. You might think I&#39;m being pedantic but it&#39;s very important to be specific, even though it&#39;s easier to just say some vague truism. It still shapes your thinking around issues in ways that may not be accurate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is, though.  Politicians on both sides are, and always have been, subservient to certain powerful institutions.  The financial institution, the military industrial complex, the intelligence community and the unelected deep state, foreign power players like Saudi Royalty and AIPAC, and large corporations all effectively supercede the two party political system.  This is very apparent from campaign contributions: the banks, the pharmaceutical lobby, AIPAC, etc, all fund both sides of political campaigns so they get their way nomatter who is in power.  The Deep State and the military industrial complex continue operations and invade other nations despite who the puppet in the white house is.  </p>

<p>People act like the government has the power to crack down and regulate business, but the truth is the opposite.  They rely on corporate donations for their campaigns, they take corporate bribes to enact favourable policy.  All unelected areas of the government such as regulatory agencies have long since been infiltrated by the businesses they are supposed to regulate.  </p>

<p>They argue about unimportant wedge issues because it makes for good theatre and distracts people from real issues.  Sure, maybe the politicians themselves believe that they are fighting the other party for power, but the true rulers are unelected.  True power doesn&#39;t allow the option to be replaced.  </p>

<p>This is not a conspiracy &quot;theory,&quot; it is a conspiracy, it is the reality of the world we live in.  Most of the real important conspiracies happen in these upper echelons of power behind the theatre that is politics.  If you don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; that then come back once you&#39;ve learned more about conspiracies, or go back to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always wanted to make a post about this. The most obvious conspiracy against the general public is creating a population that can only think with a binary mindset. Right/left, pro-gun/anti-gun, pro-life/anti-life, pro-russia/anti-russia, US/rest of the world, UK/EU...</p>

<p>There are NO issues in life that only has two sides to the discussion. There might be two obvious ones or more supported points of view, but there will always be nuances and other angles that should be considered. When you look at everything in a binary way, you&#39;ve already fallen into their trap. Look at every major issue in mainstream news and you will see them establish the story as a binary equation. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to think that one thing that sets us apart from machines is that we can engage in a non-binary way. But looking at how most people interact nowadays it seems we really are just shittily programmed meat robots. </p>

<p>No. And why do all of the coincidence theorists about shilling seem to repeat this same claim?

<p>If their behavior is designed to disrupt a reasonable, civil discussion, they they are wrong. You can say whatever the fuck you want, just don&#39;t use dishonest <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">shilling tactics</a> when you do it. </p>

<p>Understand logic, is therefore clearly not a shill</p>

<p>Ok, you probably just haven&#39;t been here very long or don&#39;t post a lot. But literally any time we talk about the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j1y5la6q&amp;amp;sh=75667764">confirmed shilling</a> or <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">shilling tactics</a>, the shills come back and say &quot;you just accuse everyone that disagrees with you of being a shill, REEEE!&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s categorically false. I haven&#39;t accused anyone of being a shill on here. I merely point out when people are using known disinformation tactics, because many of the trolls actually aren&#39;t paid (JIDF, topminds), but they are intentional disruptors.</p>

<p>That has absolutely nothing to do with whether I agree with them or not, it has everything to do with how they are trying to communicate. Or really how they are trying to stifle communication.</p>

<p>The shills do this because every once in awhile they manage to trick someone like you into thinking we are just butt hurt losers that can&#39;t handle someone disagreeing with them. It also side tracks the discussion so you can&#39;t get clear information about the well-known shilling tactics they use, because it would become readily apparent who is trying to mislead simply by the way they argue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first link you gave does not show people being caught shilling, it&#39;s just something mildly suspicious that neither of us have any ability to follow to any substantive conclusion.</p>

<p>The second is a PhD-level mathematical analysis of a theoretical model of social group dynamics, and how it can form consensus. That&#39;s not research on forum disruption methods. Tangentially related, I guess, but no more related than, say, research on how much good grammar and punctuation make it more likely for people to respect an argument, or how likely/unlikely people with deep-seated beliefs in demonstrable falsehoods are to change their beliefs when presented with contrary facts. Consensus of social groups is just way too wide of a topic.</p>

<p>No, but <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">lying to dismiss evidence</a> that counters the regime&#39;s narrative is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the ‘play dumb’ rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist, but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a murder weapon.) In order to completely avoid discussing issues, it may be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance.</p>

<p>Not only did I not assume that, I referred to shills in the 3rd person, which means I was explicitly <em>not</em> calling you a shill.

If a couple of comments can derail these people then they aren’t very good researchers anyway and it is all a big partisan circle jerk to begin with. Pretty much everyone is being manipulated on some level and the irony of all these political shenanigans unfolding on r/conspiracy with everyone yelling “shill” at each other is equally pathetic and hilarious.

<p>It&#39;s not. It&#39;s the total magnitude of upvotes that proves both massive support and massive vote botting to suppress. You simply don&#39;t get 200 upvotes in an hour on posts in conspiracy unless they are incredibly popular. Not even the bots can do that.</p>

<p>I only recall calling someone a shill in r/conspiracy once, and that was when they said &quot;I am a shill&quot; and I merely said that I agreed. If you read carefully, every other time it&#39;s merely pointing to evidence of dishonest participating, never outright calling someone a shill. </p>

<p>It has little to do with the media. Russiagate is a <a href="http://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2017/eirv44n03-20170120/20-27_4403.pdf">hoax</a> that is about maintaining geopolitical tension against Russia, because Russia has threatened the petrodollar with the BRICS bank and supporting the One Belt One Road initiative in China. It can be traced pretty directly to the <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-02-14/john-brennan-mastermind-behind-russiagate">CIA</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m worried about the Federal Reserve printing money, the military industrial complex slaughtering millions of innocent people. Donald Trump making pussy-grabbing jokes isn&#39;t even close to the worst thing he&#39;s done, and none of it is a major concern for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issues with him aren’t about pussy grabbing, its about scam schools, potential money laundering, general untrustworthiness. Seychelles was Erik prince, not a letter agency. The Ukraine platform change didnt come from cia. My personal belief is that Russian interference helped trump, and he knew about it, but it wasn’t for benevolent purposes for trump. I think they knew it would piss off lots of people, they get to have an American president with very few ideas of his own mostly built on nationalism and isolationism, to weaken US influence on a global scale in preparation for the launch of the gold backed petro yuan.  It’s naive, in my opinion, to think the only bad players involved in this mud. There are just too many players with dirty connections that trump put there. When the Nunes memo gained a lot of hype, I thought it was going to be a real bombshell—not because of the hype, but because at that point I was convinced that the game was about the obama admin finding out trump did illegal shit via five eyes or some other illegal surveillance, and both sides were now racing to figure out how to prove one side committed crimes without revealing their own. I’m still not entirely convinced this isn’t what happened. </p>

<p>The Ukraine platform change didnt come from cia. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It absolutely did. Brzezinski came up with the <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/chris_ernesto/2014/03/14/brzezinski-mapped-out-the-battle-for-ukraine-in-1997/">scheme</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would the United States run the risk of siding with anti-Semitic, neo-Nazis in Ukraine?</p>

<p>One of the keys may be found by looking back at Zbigniew Brzezinski’s 1997 book, The Grand Chessboard in which he wrote, “Ukraine, a new and important space on the Eurasian chessboard, is a geopolitical pivot because its very existence as an independent country helps to transform Russia. Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire.”</p>

<p>“However, if Moscow regains control over Ukraine, with its 52 million people and major resources as well as access to the Black Sea, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, spanning Europe and Asia.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then the State Department (extension of CIA) was [caught](<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/us-ukraine-russia-eu-victoria-nuland">www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/us-ukraine-russia-eu-victoria-nuland</a>) planning the coup. Then you had Soros using his plants from the open societies foundation to finally set off the <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2017/eirv44n08-20170224/04-21_4408.pdf">Neo Nazi coup</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the Nunes memo gained a lot of hype, I thought it was going to be a real bombshell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was. A Congressional committee admitted that the FBI engaged in a seditious conspiracy to bring false charges against the president.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>because at that point I was convinced that the game was about the obama admin finding out trump did illegal shit via five eyes or some other illegal surveillance, and both sides were now racing to figure out how to prove one side committed crimes without revealing their own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there were any way they could pin this thing to Trump, they would have done it by now. I mean, you have FBI and CIA guys on tv openly talking about the need to &quot;take to the streets&quot; for a &quot;revolution.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was no &quot;Russian aggression.&quot; It was American aggression, undeniable because of the phone call planning it. Russia stepped in because the Ukrainians overwhelmingly supported it, and to protect Ukraine from the <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2017/eirv44n08-20170224/04-21_4408.pdf">Neo-Nazis</a> the US had installed</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While many people came to the Maidan waving EU flags and were full of hope for a better life, the paramilitary groups, who repeatedly escalated the violence and sabotaged every interim agreement to resolve the standoff, marched under the red and black flag of the 
Organization  of  Ukrainian  Nationalists  (OUN),  the 
mid-20th-century fascist movement of Stepan Bandera. The OUN had collaborated with the Nazis during World War II and carried out the ethnic-cleansing mass murder of Poles and Jews on its own, as well. These neo-Nazi groups called themselves Right Sector; their formation and build-up during 1991-2013 stemmed directly out of 
funding  to  Bandera’s  followers  by  MI6  and  the  Allen<br/>
Dulles wing of the American CIA during the Cold War.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was so crazy even Mockingbird Media <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/02/25/is_the_us_backing_neo_nazis_in_ukraine_partner/">covered it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>White supremacist banners and Confederate flags were draped inside Kiev’s occupied City Hall, and demonstrators have hoisted Nazi SS and white power symbols over a toppled memorial to V.I. Lenin. After Yanukovich fled his palatial estate by helicopter, EuroMaidan protesters destroyed a memorial to Ukrainians who died battling German occupation during World War II. Sieg heil salutes and the Nazi Wolfsangel symbol have become an increasingly common site in Maidan Square, and neo-Nazi forces have established “autonomous zones” in and around Kiev.</p>

<p>An Anarchist group called AntiFascist Union Ukraine attempted to join the Euromaidan demonstrations but found it difficult to avoid threats of violence and imprecations from the gangs of neo-Nazis roving the square. “They called the Anarchists things like Jews, blacks, Communists,” one of its members said. “There weren’t even any Communists, that was just an insult.”...</p>

<p>One of the “Big Three” political parties behind the protests is the ultra-nationalist Svoboda, whose leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, has called for the liberation of his country from the “Muscovite-Jewish mafia.” After the 2010 conviction of the Nazi death camp guard John Demjanjuk for his supporting role in the death of nearly 30,000 people at the Sobibor camp, Tyahnybok rushed to Germany to declare him a hero who was “fighting for truth.” In the Ukrainian parliament, where Svoboda holds an unprecedented 37 seats, Tyahnybok’s deputy Yuriy Mykhalchyshyn is fond of quoting Joseph Goebbels – he has even founded a think tank originally called “the Joseph Goebbels Political Research Center.” According to Per Anders Rudling, a leading academic expert on European neo-fascism, the self-described “socialist nationalist” Mykhalchyshyn is the main link between Svoboda’s official wing and neo-Nazi militias like Right Sector.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because people either find it amusing or interesting.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you a personal anecdote: my dad has been neck deep in YouTube conspiracy videos for the past 3 years. It is hard to have a conversation with him anymore without him flying off the handle and accusing me of being brain washed or ignoring clear facts (like the devil creating Facebook or the moon being in the wrong spot in the sky).</p>

<p>Coming here kind of helps me understand his viewpoint a little more (not much more), tempers me to what kind of arguments he might make, and in all honesty I find a lot of the overly dramatic theorising here amusing. It&#39;s cathartic in a way, because I get to laugh at dumb stuff here instead of in my dad&#39;s face.</p>

<p>Basically, it&#39;s a free and open forum and we all have reddit accounts, not r/conspiracy accounts. People who don&#39;t believe in your stuff are going to get involved sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. I was mod of <a href="/r/Wikileaks">/r/Wikileaks</a> during the election and I was able the handle this very well. Sadly a corporate mod ran me out, but I kept up the discussion for quite a while. These were the steps I took.</p>

<p><strong>Internal Modding Politics</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Refuse all private communication with other mods, beyond perfunctory admin</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead, FORCE any mod wanting to make a change, or proposition, to make it public, in a &quot;Meta&quot; discussion thread, same as a user. Same for inviting new mods, and similar type of discussion. - A corporate mod will encourage exclusive use of back alley channels, making their strange behavior less observable to the community at large. Without the community knowing each of their strange proposals, they are too easily able to sway the community on to their &#39;team&#39; - whatever that means. Their modding needs to be public, and all ideas discussed publicly - No backroom channels.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Reduce the rules to simplistic concepts, focusing on civility and staying on topic</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Ideally, the only two rules necessary are &quot;Do not be mean to others&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t &#39;spam&#39; off-topic shit&quot;. You should ALLOW &quot;Meta&quot; threads and so forth, their hearts content. Is Conspiracy to &quot;Trumpian&quot;? Sure, make a thread for that discussion. However, asking that within a thread discussing those little green frogs Hillary coughed up would be unacceptable - Within a thread, all comments must be &#39;on topic&#39;, and Threads CAN be off topic, or meta topics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Forcing everything to the public cleans up mod politic corruption. I would ban fairly quickly, and most often publicly. My rule was 2 day instant ban for any &#39;uncivil&#39; behavior, or generalized spam. Automatically forgiven if they asked to be forgiven somewhat nicely. Obnoxious people stayed banned. Repeat offenders, or people without a history of any positive comments would get a 30 day ban instantly. If your only contribution is rudeness, you get long bans, instantly. </p>

<p><strong>Regarding Moderation of subs</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Regarding threads, discourage sensationalist titles, and misuse of words</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, I might suggest <strong>banning</strong> the use of &quot;bomb&quot; to mean &quot;big news&quot; and &quot;explosive&quot; to mean &quot;important event&quot; within Conspiracy. Such words need to be only used when the topic is an actual bomb, explosive, or killing, or what have you, and not be allowed as thread titles, purely as superlatives. Most other issues you can simply deal with by flaring the thread appropriately vs removals.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>All Mainstream media outlets should be permanently banned</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>I did a test linking to a Washington Post article a subreddit with no traffic. It got 10 upvotes in a day, with the next highest thing in 2 weeks getting 4 upvotes. They simply spam crawlers to upvote their shit about once per hour. Can&#39;t be stopped, should be permanently banned. Best to link to only sourced material, or individual journalist run organizations. The other issue with Mainstream Media is that the article title are often opposite of the content, or an article may get written with 20 popup ads for the &#39;opposite&#39; side flooding your experience. Effectively baiting supporters of X candidate to click, while spamming them with ads for the opposition. With individual journalists run sites, this is hard to achieve as they must constantly switch side themselves, lessen credibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Regarding Spam comment attacks, switch the sub to default sort by new</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Default sorting by new usually does not bother users too badly, but completely destroys the power up &#39;up vote&#39; bots, and brigading. It&#39;s much easier to upvote 10 or so comments to top positions within large threads, than it is to post 100 separate comments. Sorting by &quot;New&quot; effectively makes the majority of Users become what is seen, and upvote matter less - I would turn this feature on and off, as appropriate, but the threads were generally much better with it on. After 6 hours, or the top threads of the day, might get individually switched to &quot;Best&quot;, if I felt the &quot;best&quot; represented the character of the Sub. If &quot;best&quot; was &quot;Conspiracy sucks balls&quot;, I would leave it as new.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Stickied Topics almost always represented Important Threads, or Educational Threads</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>I would OFTEN sticky thread teaching history. Especially from alternative points of view. For example, I had a lot of Malcolm X speeches (and other Civil Rights leader) as stickies on MLK Day. For JFK assassination, I featured famous speeches of him and his brother. At other times, I had &quot;untold history by Stone&quot; and &quot;Citizen 4&quot;, and so on. I also had the Guerrilla Manifesto, and other type of educational material as the sticky. In addition, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to promote a good contributing user, or sticky a thread which contained interesting content, even though it got few votes. Doing an approach like this lead to a higher educated user base, meaning that more educated topics were better received long-term.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>With policies like that, you can get a cleanly run, highly functional sub, with happy users. It&#39;s more difficult that &#39;do nothing at all&#39;, but it&#39;s absolutely not impossible, and far easier than that backroom dealing that most subs linger in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly attacked due process when you derided me for wanting &quot;stronger evidence&quot; before &quot;jump[ing] to any conclusions&quot;. </p>

<p>You clearly have very little knowledge of the law. A crime requires both a mental state (mens rea) and a criminal action. Someone writing an email is not a criminal action. Thus, no crime was committed by simply sending an email to set up a meeting. If Mueller could prove to a grand jury that a crime was committed, Trump would be indicted by now. You are simply grasping at straws here. </p>

<p>Due process is the idea that the state must respect all legal rights that are owed to a person, including the right that they are innocent until proven guilty based on objective evidence. It is the foundation of our legal system. If you don&#39;t like it, maybe you should move to... Russia! : )</p>

<p>At the end of his investigation, Mueller will present the evidence to congress, and they will use that evidence to decide whether or not to impeach Trump. Mueller needs to make the strongest case possible, so he&#39;s being patient and gathering as much evidence as he can. It would also benefit him to wait until after the 2018 elections, as many in congress are allergic to holding Trump accountable for anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, he cannot indict because he doesn&#39;t have any evidence. You clearly have no idea how this process works. Mueller would take his evidence to a grand jury first, which would have the power to indict Trump. </p>

<p>A prominent New York judge once stated that a decent prosecutor could get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich. What does that say about Mueller&#39;s investigation?</p>

<p>Do you seriously think that Mueller would hold back an indictment, thereby allowing a criminal who conspired with a foreign government to remain President if he had hard evidence to indict? You seriously seem delusional. I hope you find the help you so clearly need. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t believe me, perhaps you will believe the Washington Post: &quot;For decades, scholars have debated the question of whether the Constitution allows a sitting president to be indicted and tried while in office — and whether it would be prudent to do so. Two decades ago, independent counsel Kenneth Starr confronted these questions while investigating President Bill Clinton and answered yes to the first, but no to the second.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest actually reading the article you posted instead of stopping at the first quote you agree with. It states that the current standing supreme court decision is that a sitting president is immune from indictment. Ken Starr is not a constitutional scholar nor a supreme court justice, so his opinion on the matter means precisely jack shit.</p>

<p>So thank you for supporting my assertion that Mueller doesn&#39;t have the power to indict Trump. As I stated before, only congress has the power to hold him accountable for any wrongdoing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did read the article. And it clearly states that there is a precedent for indictment, but indicting may not be politically expedient. </p>

<p>Thus, it seems like you are arguing that Mueller should wait for the political winds to change before indicting. This course of action would seem to be more politically motivated than motivated for a desire to uncover the truth.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let your dislike of Trump circumvent your critical thinking skills. I don&#39;t like him either. But I&#39;m not willing to compromise due process of law to put Mike Pence in the Oval Office. Seems like an even worse scenario to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. I was mod of <a href="/r/Wikileaks">/r/Wikileaks</a> during the election and I was able the handle this very well. Sadly a corporate mod ran me out, but I kept up the discussion for quite a while. These were the steps I took.</p>

<p><strong>Internal Modding Politics</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Refuse all private communication with other mods, beyond perfunctory admin</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead, FORCE any mod wanting to make a change, or proposition, to make it public, in a &quot;Meta&quot; discussion thread, same as a user. Same for inviting new mods, and similar type of discussion. - A corporate mod will encourage exclusive use of back alley channels, making their strange behavior less observable to the community at large. Without the community knowing each of their strange proposals, they are too easily able to sway the community on to their &#39;team&#39; - whatever that means. Their modding needs to be public, and all ideas discussed publicly - No backroom channels.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Reduce the rules to simplistic concepts, focusing on civility and staying on topic</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Ideally, the only two rules necessary are &quot;Do not be mean to others&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t &#39;spam&#39; off-topic shit&quot;. You should ALLOW &quot;Meta&quot; threads and so forth, their hearts content. Is Conspiracy to &quot;Trumpian&quot;? Sure, make a thread for that discussion. However, asking that within a thread discussing those little green frogs Hillary coughed up would be unacceptable - Within a thread, all comments must be &#39;on topic&#39;, and Threads CAN be off topic, or meta topics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Forcing everything to the public cleans up mod politic corruption. I would ban fairly quickly, and most often publicly. My rule was 2 day instant ban for any &#39;uncivil&#39; behavior, or generalized spam. Automatically forgiven if they asked to be forgiven somewhat nicely. Obnoxious people stayed banned. Repeat offenders, or people without a history of any positive comments would get a 30 day ban instantly. If your only contribution is rudeness, you get long bans, instantly. </p>

<p><strong>Regarding Moderation of subs</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Regarding threads, discourage sensationalist titles, and misuse of words</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, I might suggest <strong>banning</strong> the use of &quot;bomb&quot; to mean &quot;big news&quot; and &quot;explosive&quot; to mean &quot;important event&quot; within Conspiracy. Such words need to be only used when the topic is an actual bomb, explosive, or killing, or what have you, and not be allowed as thread titles, purely as superlatives. Most other issues you can simply deal with by flaring the thread appropriately vs removals.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>All Mainstream media outlets should be permanently banned</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>I did a test linking to a Washington Post article a subreddit with no traffic. It got 10 upvotes in a day, with the next highest thing in 2 weeks getting 4 upvotes. They simply spam crawlers to upvote their shit about once per hour. Can&#39;t be stopped, should be permanently banned. Best to link to only sourced material, or individual journalist run organizations. The other issue with Mainstream Media is that the article title are often opposite of the content, or an article may get written with 20 popup ads for the &#39;opposite&#39; side flooding your experience. Effectively baiting supporters of X candidate to click, while spamming them with ads for the opposition. With individual journalists run sites, this is hard to achieve as they must constantly switch side themselves, lessen credibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Regarding Spam comment attacks, switch the sub to default sort by new</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Default sorting by new usually does not bother users too badly, but completely destroys the power up &#39;up vote&#39; bots, and brigading. It&#39;s much easier to upvote 10 or so comments to top positions within large threads, than it is to post 100 separate comments. Sorting by &quot;New&quot; effectively makes the majority of Users become what is seen, and upvote matter less - I would turn this feature on and off, as appropriate, but the threads were generally much better with it on. After 6 hours, or the top threads of the day, might get individually switched to &quot;Best&quot;, if I felt the &quot;best&quot; represented the character of the Sub. If &quot;best&quot; was &quot;Conspiracy sucks balls&quot;, I would leave it as new.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Stickied Topics almost always represented Important Threads, or Educational Threads</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>I would OFTEN sticky thread teaching history. Especially from alternative points of view. For example, I had a lot of Malcolm X speeches (and other Civil Rights leader) as stickies on MLK Day. For JFK assassination, I featured famous speeches of him and his brother. At other times, I had &quot;untold history by Stone&quot; and &quot;Citizen 4&quot;, and so on. I also had the Guerrilla Manifesto, and other type of educational material as the sticky. In addition, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to promote a good contributing user, or sticky a thread which contained interesting content, even though it got few votes. Doing an approach like this lead to a higher educated user base, meaning that more educated topics were better received long-term.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>With policies like that, you can get a cleanly run, highly functional sub, with happy users. It&#39;s more difficult that &#39;do nothing at all&#39;, but it&#39;s absolutely not impossible, and far easier than that backroom dealing that most subs linger in.</p>

<p>By all means, discuss! Usually I don&#39;t see any discussion though, only a blanket dismissal of all things &quot;MSM&quot; no matter how true the content may be.</p>

<p>Critical thinking is being tossed away, in it&#39;s place is a cult chanting &quot;fake news&quot; with zero independent thought.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust <em>all</em> MSM, but they obviously get some things right. You&#39;ve gotta be able to filter out the bias and find the real news. The real sheep are the ones not trusting <em>any</em> MSM just because it&#39;s MSM. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For example:  “Someone was shot in the mall today” Is the fact. Every news article, every news agency will report that fact.</p>

<p>Fox is going to tell you that that person was shot because she was a blonde white person and everybody who is blonde and white needs to be scared. Nancy Grace has more information at 11.</p>

<p>But that’s not what really happened.</p>

<p>Perhaps CNN wants to paint it as a struggle between rich and poor. Or maybe it’s because she was a Russian exchange bride! But the issue is that all we know is that person was shot in the mall. We need to know which mall in front of what store, the persons name stuff like that.</p>

<p>Emotion is what sells policy to the masses.  If the people have too much real information they don’t become emotional. If they aren’t emotional you can’t get them angry and send them to war as easily.</p>

<p>So it’s obvious that when they focus on a ridiculous upsetting news story like transgender bathrooms it is because they need people in emotional state to validate whatever they’re going to bring out next.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I can tell the mods are in on it and corrupted.  They don&#39;t respond to questions and they have every power to prevent the spammy t_d crap about why Russia isn&#39;t meddling or prevent the shareblue/israel brigading.  </p>

<p>It is simply built into the platform.  Also the law enforcement ties, something is very fishy here in that I get almost 0 human responses to any post and then a handful that are either hasbara or police questioning me. </p>

<p>Look at my history.  Also on my old account u/mindhawk </p>

<p>I document some of it, and my similar experiences at steemit on my account there @mindhawk.  Further study will be rewarded.  </p>

<p>I use reddit(and twitar) with the knowledge it is a comprimised platform owned by hasbara and shareblue working together, with some ruskie infiltration that is tough for them to deal with because it is on a massive scale.  </p>

<p>So us humans are sort of bouncing around in between the robots.  It is only worth posting if your intent is to jam the entire operation and make their jobs of censorship and disinformation more difficult.  </p>

<p>It is def odd don&#39;t you think there is no competitor even close to reddit?  And the form for reddit is basically good, only what goes on behind the scenes turns the whole of it into a propaganda farce.  Governments could be built around the concept of reddit if bots and shills could be prevented.  </p>

<p>With blockchain they can be prevented, but all the companies trying to do this like steemit and the israeli one are simply psy-op honeypot like facebork.  </p>

<p>If you tried to do an independant one, your third employee would be cia or mossad so this is the type of world we live in now, which should frighten anyone once they see this.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who owns Reddit? We keep thinking that these are groups what if these were not groups. What if these coordinated tactics were simply Reddit’s platform and interest. I am starting to believe that Reddit is a platform used by the “elites” or “cabal” “council of 300” to influence and control. Imagine how much info the are gathering. Ideas they can simply use for their own personal gain. I used to think MSM were separate entities with the goal of making profits through ratings. Lol 😂 the idea that Reddit is owned by one individual is just a front man and their is a powerful entity who has a stake in controlling info. CIA? Fbi? Military? Deep state? Big pharma?politicians? All are front men. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think too many self-posts that have nothing to do with actual conspiracies and conspiracy theories have been posted. And there needs to be curtailing of that. These self-posts detract heavily from the idea of looking for things and instead breed paranoia and division within the community. Self-posts are important, but the constant inundation of posts like this one for example, is not good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for going off too much I’m just someone who thinks that just be cause the media will attack him at every turn that doesn’t exclude collusion from being true. Of course democrat media pushes the narrative, they don’t like him. But the dude has been a sketchy liar for decades and his behavior has been divisive, compulsive, and made the country appear unstable. The questionable financing, the change in political party, shady real estate deals, statements from jr, etc all point to a potential if not probable connections between trump and Russian oligarchs. Even without the potential coordinated email release, there is <em>plenty</em> of cause to dig into this guy. For that reason alone this sub <em>should</em> be doubtful of him. Trust no one. Only the truth matters regardless of where it comes from. Be open minded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, many people keep their ego and their ideas in the same spot, so it&#39;s hard (if not impossible) to target one without hitting the other. Many conspiracy theorists like to pretend cognitive dissonance only exists on the MSM-side of the spectrum, but we fall victim to it ourselves just as often.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then why did you bring up their names? Just for fun? </p>

<p>I think Trump is smarter than you think. I mean, he is the president of the United States. You are not. </p>

<p>I think Trump won because people were tired of the same old establishment-career politicians pushing the same lies. It’s pretty easy for anyone who took the time to research Clinton’s political career to tell that she is basically a Republican pretending to be a Democrat. Pretty much everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie. She is not “progressive” even in the slightest degree. She also said “It’s my turn to be president”. I can’t respect anyone who would vote for a candidate that said that...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For example:  “Someone was shot in the mall today” Is the fact. Every news article, every news agency will report that fact.</p>

<p>Fox is going to tell you that that person was shot because she was a blonde white person and everybody who is blonde and white needs to be scared. Nancy Grace has more information at 11.</p>

<p>But that’s not what really happened.</p>

<p>Perhaps CNN wants to paint it as a struggle between rich and poor. Or maybe it’s because she was a Russian exchange bride! But the issue is that all we know is that person was shot in the mall. We need to know which mall in front of what store, the persons name stuff like that.</p>

<p>Emotion is what sells policy to the masses.  If the people have too much real information they don’t become emotional. If they aren’t emotional you can’t get them angry and send them to war as easily.</p>

<p>So it’s obvious that when they focus on a ridiculous upsetting news story like transgender bathrooms it is because they need people in emotional state to validate whatever they’re going to bring out next.</p>
