        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For all of the fake news shared and data harvested, getting people to give up Facebook only serves the established institutions and their grip on power. There are so many examples, but here are a few: </p>

<p>The West Virginia teacher&#39;s strike was accomplished without official union representation, but just coordinated through a Facebook group. </p>

<p>More importantly, Facebook means control of the political news we get. I was just listening to Bernie Sanders in an interview talking about how he got 20 seconds of coverage from TV news in the last election, but he&#39;s been throwing Facebook town halls with millions of viewers recently. There are a lot of organizations looking to upset the Democratic primaries, and vote in candidates who care about voters, not corporate campaign donations. They&#39;re also organizing and spreading information on Facebook and social media. Without Facebook you&#39;re back to either letting the media decide who they cover, and what they cover. It seems like no surprise that this is hitting a fever pitch as we&#39;re running into the primaries for 2018. </p>

<p>Social media has its problems and drawbacks, but it also allows people to share and amplify information without official editors deciding what can and can&#39;t be shared. This attack on Facebook is an attack on your right to receive and spread the information you choose. Reddit&#39;s nice, but your grandparents aren&#39;t on here, and they vote. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue with SM isn&#39;t its ability for communication- that&#39;s the dream of the web itself. The issue with Socials is the voluntary mass data collection, and the utilization of that data. It&#39;s the creation of mental safe spaces where only ideas you like or agree with get through to you. And it&#39;s the destruction of old social bonds by a twisted sense of &quot;friendship&quot; and the dopamine release that comes with dozens, or hundreds, of thousands of people you don&#39;t know liking some staged snapshot of your life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first, I can&#39;t give up a platform I&#39;ve never used. Secondly- as I said, it is about privacy and what <em>you</em> give up for access to that platform. If you want to let FB, and whoever they sell your data to, to know everything about you, your friends and family, what you like, believe, and so much more, that is totally your prerogative. </p>

<p>But massive social change happened before FB, just like it can happen without it. There was no internet when the Civil Rights movement started, nor during the 30&#39;s when the country collapsed economically, nor in the 60&#39;s with the political violence and assassinations.</p>

<p>There are ways to work around it, but as I said, it&#39;s your prerogative if you want to work within that beast. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re a &quot;straight up&quot; shill for facebook?</p>

<p>Or you&#39;re just defending a site and founder who uses and abuses you and your rights and those who seek to manipulate you for political and social experiments?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s ok, people here know exactly what you&#39;re up to even if you are legitimately that ignorant of your actions.</p>

<p>This is a terrible, terrible attempt to be some kind of a real &quot;user&quot; of facebook coming to its defense.  This is only an example of what a shilling effort would attempt to do on this sub in order to combat the realizations that more and more people are coming to as time goes on.  One of the best examples here that r/conspiracy is touching on some spots that certain people with too much money would not like touched on.</p>

<p>Hey, its just a shame that you&#39;re the one to be manipulated enough to have to do the job and this is your best effort.  A post.  You&#39;re just the tool, you&#39;re just the sucker they managed to convince to come here on their behalf.  It&#39;s quite the funny thing.  Or wait, I&#39;ll use one of the lines that always comes out that certain shills love to use. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just &quot;sad&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off .... I never said you were ignorant at all. NEVER. </p>

<p>Second .... I said you were salty BC of the way you replied to OP.  Do you know what that term means ? </p>

<p>Third ....  seriously? You’ve obviously had a bad day and Iam sorry for that, but your attack on OP for what YOU perceived as “racist” was unnecessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually agree with what you&#39;re saying here and will receive the appropriate amount of downvotes, I&#39;m sure. But Facebook is not only used for benign things but also for organizing rallies and other things. It&#39;s probably easier to spill the dirt on Facebook than to try and discredit all the rallies. Very strategic, probably by the very people this sub is in support of ousting. And this sub is defending the action, just as expected, because of their hate for Facebook.</p>
