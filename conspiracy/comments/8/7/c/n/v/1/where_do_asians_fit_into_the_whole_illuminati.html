        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m currently enrolled in an asian studies class at college, and it&#39;s been very interesting because I literally knew nothing about Asian history.</p>

<p>China has a crazy history, it invented government and taxation, amongst many other things almost 6000 years ago. It remained unchallenged as arguably the most advanced civilization on Earth with no competitors for a very long time, and they only fell behind due to an isolationist perspective while Europe began to accumulate technology and imperialize over the past 500 years.</p>

<p>East Asians also apparently have the highest IQ, except for Ashkenazi jews who have an average IQ 5 points higher.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at is, these east asain races are almost half the Earth&#39;s population, extremely high IQ and culturally very accomplished. We tend to look at asia as sort of a shithole, but that&#39;s only due to very recent global events.</p>

<p>Why is it that all these grandiose conspiracy theories never involve asian people? It&#39;s almost as if white people have delusions of grandeur and make these insanely bizarre and creative stories that have snowballed out of control. I mean what are Asians and what do they represent in the traditionally well known conspiracy theories?</p>

<p>**EDIT: Sorry, let me try to re-articulate. It just seems to me that virtually all paranormal/alien/demonic/religious conspiracy theories attribute white european accomplishments to some divine or demonic force, but they never acknowledge the (arguably) equal accomplishments of east asians. It&#39;s like they don&#39;t exist within the context of the &quot;illuminati&quot;, 33rd degree, etc etc. It just sort of seems like white people are coming up with these grandiose theories about ourselves with zero acknowledgment towards asians.</p>

<p>mao was a yale/skull and bones operative (&#39;yale in china&#39; enabled him) and modern china is still the same. before nixon went to china kissinger went first to arrange the whole thing, but even before kissinger a large group of  200-300 businessmen, financiers and industrialists from new york went and made a bunch of deals. this was the whole point of opening up china.  </p>

<p>i also think that the chinese invasion of tibet was partially prepared and planned by the oss/cia</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the info, I guess I was wondering about genetics as well. Aren&#39;t white people supposed to have the blood of nephilim or something, which gives us our &quot;whiteness&quot; and beauty and intelligence? Asians can also be pretty white too and have those other qualities (asians aren&#39;t as attractive as whites on a whole IMO, but there are some very beautiful &quot;white&quot; asian people). I&#39;m saying this because all religious conspiracy theories dealing with gods, demons, genetic engineering, etc seem to just ignore Asians completely. It&#39;s like they don&#39;t exist. People like Albert Pike seem to have written all their theories without and knowledge or understanding of the asian&#39;s place in the world, which I think creates a rather large hole in their theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the whole eurasian continent experienced many migrations, wars, conquests and genocides...  but i am not sure about the nephilim.  i only know what the bible says about it.</p>

<p>i think the asians are ignored because they were considered barbarians and heathen in older times by the church of rome and in modern times european fascists like mussolini, hitler and franco and american eugenicists promote the same idea of them being a lesser human.</p>

<p>otoh, most if not all major oriental religions and pagan rites are incorporated into the new age movement started by jesuit teilhard and into helena blavatskys theosophy.</p>

<p>interestingly pierre teilhard was also involved in the piltdown man hoax, which made darwins theory of evolution beleivable and acceptable to the people in the west.</p>

<p>I would say this kind of thinking is the result of the media and colonialist perspectives. It&#39;s part of the propaganda machine that promotes hate, divide, and ignorance.</p>

<p>Other than that I think your post is interesting. I think the illuminati are a loosely knit group of many powerful secret societies, kind of like different families of mobs that make deals and such but still want what&#39;s best for there part of the group. These groups are from all around the world, I&#39;m sure there are many Asian and other races involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna ignore your personal opinions on attractivesness for obvious reasons, but it&#39;s important to point out, contrary to what most &quot;westerners&quot; think about China: China is huge and has an incredible variety of cultures and ethnicities within it. If you go the western parts of China you will naturally find fair-skinned people who are ethnically either the same, mixed or similar to eastern europeans, persians, etc. Ethnic Mongolians / Tibetans from China are very different, as are even Northern Chinese etc. etc. You&#39;re lumping the concept of &#39;Han&#39; Chinese as representative of China as a whole. Also, there are hundreds of local dialects and different languages in China and different cultures. You may not know, for example, that certain villages in China are matriarchal. The women run things, and in the old days, ladders would be put out of the houses so that men can climb up and pleasure the women running the community. </p>

<p>As with most who control the power, the Han Chinese felt they were the chosen ones, and more &quot;beautiful&quot; than the other subcultures in China. There&#39;s an obvious reason why China in Chinese translates to the &quot;middle kingdom&quot; or &quot;central kingdom&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the few educated responses here.</p>

<p>When you combine the ethno-religious diversity of the PRC with the national rejection of organized religion, the reasoning behind a lack of a coherent paegan cabal becomes clear. If we are staying on the level, there are and do exist factional religious sects in the chinese elite. Churches in Hainan are not closed for a reason.</p>

<p>I am not, personally, a proponent of the idea that every major pollitical institution is the result of some conspiracy. That said, conspiracy theories regarding PRC rule are just as prevelant (if not more so) in the chinese zeitgast vs that of the West or US.</p>

Delusions of grandeur because we have separate cultures, and live on separate continents than the majority of asians = delusions of granduer? That&#39;s fucking retarded. If it isn&#39;t purposeful race baiting it&#39;s some of the stupidest shit I&#39;ve ever read. And your replying to my comment asking how ANY of it is baiting is fucking retarded to.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do white people have mostly white people in their mythos, and conspiracies and stories that originate from majority white populations? Why aren&#39;t there more asians. White people have delusions of grandeur&quot; </p>

<p>Are you people all fucking retarded? But ya, my use of cunt is offensive lmao. Jesus Christ. OP even edited it to be slightly less baity. Do you believe american celebrities &quot;of colour&quot; when they complain that there aren&#39;t enough blacks in certain movies or awards shows? When they are like 10 percent of the countries population? Do you think they are being genuine in their complaints? Because that&#39;s equally retarded. </p>

<p>ALSO PLEASE SOMEONE ANYONE AT ALL EXPLAIN TO ME HOW HAVE DIFFERENT CULTURES ON DIFFERENT FUCKING CONTINENTS IS A FUCKING CONSPIRACY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jews were a backwards tribe in MENA. They knew nothing of the East at the time of Bible. Generally speaking, the West&#39;s understanding of the East is poor, because we do not have a good understanding of the their languages. STEM flourished in Europe before China for whatever reason. It is the development of science and technology that allowed the West to conquer the East, and these wars and suppression further regressed the East. Although the Japanese and the Chinese fighting back lead to their eventual relative freedom and economic and political development. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you mean. I&#39;m from India and initially I used to think like this. But the fact is that these &quot;white people&quot; are just better researched about their own lands, histories and families and so their conspiracies talk only about that. </p>

<p>To answer the question what do the Illuminati have to do with China or India or whatever your country is, you&#39;ll have to get into it yourself. For example, in India, I looked into the ownership of our central bank and how its heads are decided. I looked into the holdings, histories etc. of our riches families and bloodlines.</p>

<p>Sure, I didn&#39;t find the Biblical woo-woo you find in Western avatars of such theories, but I certainly found lots to keep me interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting question from OP, I&#39;ll wade in with my two cents. </p>

<p>&quot;China&quot; in all of its iterations and dynasties have incredibly complex histories and occult traditions just as the western, African, and Oceanic aboriginal traditions as well. In fact the oceanic aboriginal traditions have some of the most fascinating occult histories of human civilization. </p>

<p>One of the reasons Chinese traditions are not talked about much in western discussion is as you pointed out the isolationism of China. They&#39;ve never trusted outsiders and so little of China&#39;s true traditions and occult knowledge was known outside of China and the vassal states that were part of it. Another reason is because the vast amount of literature throughout history is recorded in very traditional Chinese that is not easily understood by the average Chinese person nowadays, making it ultra difficult for a Chinese person to research it even if they wanted to. Take a look at some of the alchemical texts from the turn of the century or old british historical texts...the way they wrote was signficantly different from English as it is now. Now imagine that multiplied by 33, and also written in different characters (there&#39;s even the difference between simplified and traditional Chinese used now), not only are there few modern Chinese scholars who really dive deep into it, can you imagein western historians or enthusiasts who don&#39;t understand the language trying to study it...</p>

<p>As it is in China now, throughout history true knowledge and power have always been concentrated in the 0.01%. China has long perfected the art of controlling the masses. But if you could understand the language, you can still see through the available traditional tales and myths that many of the traditions also overlap. China had it&#39;s priests and oracles just as the greeks and egyptians did. China also has its creation myths that include stories of people coming out of rocks, great floods, multiple gods warring in heavens, etc. etc. The Chinese traditionally viewed westerners from Eastern and Western Europe as barbarians, as well as Mongoilans and South East asians as inferior, just as many Europeans did the same in reverse. Perhaps, I don&#39;t know, these stories actually all point to the same thing but simply told through an egotistical / ethnocentric viewpoint adapted for each particular culture.</p>

<p>These histories and traditions are even less known now since the Cultural Revolution. Mao essentially whitewashed an entire generation of Chinese people, and in one of the most disturbing yet sadly effective social experiements ever, we have a new generation of Chinese people that have essentially been severed from the old ideas. And in this sense, China has successfully barricaded the world and its own people from its inredibly rich esoteric and occult knowledge perhaps more effectively than any of the other great civilizations. </p>

<p>To get a tiny taste of the Chinese occult traditions, you can still read the immensely popular classics like &quot;The Journey to the West&quot; with the monkey god and &quot;The outlaws of the Marsh&quot;. These stories like many traditional tales are often allegorical and contain some hidden clues the occult traditions of ancient China.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Judeo-Christian based conspiracies are nothing more than navel gazing by people who have no exposure to other races and cultures.  It was Europe&#39;s technological advantages in sailing and gunpowder  (even though China invented it) as well as a more aggressive approach to empire than China that lead to its cultural hegemony today. Pseudo-religious theories are just fantasies of people who cannot see past their own cultural boundaries. </p>
