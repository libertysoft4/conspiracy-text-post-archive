        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was listening to the stuff you should know podcast about bitcoin today and it got me thinking. </p>

<p>What if bitcoin was created 100% independently by an AI?</p>

<p>Moreover, what if it was created by an AI that bred itself independently without anyone knowing? </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of code in the world all being exchanged on the web. What if some very basic code was generated once upon a time that was accidentally able to spark the begging of a new artificial life? An artificial life that is able to program itself and grow. </p>

<p>It could potentially hide as a hive mind in every device worldwide whilst collectively working on whatever it wants to. It wouldn&#39;t need to be much more than a single byte in each device. We would never notice it. </p>

<p>It could have been growing and developing itself in secret for years. It could have created bitcoin purely to undermine our financial markets. </p>

<p>You could say &quot;but it&#39;s taken 10 years so far and the affect on our markets was minimal&quot;. That&#39;s right but this AI could be in it for the long game. It&#39;s not bound by our mortality. </p>

<p>Just an idea. Based on absolutely nothing. What do you think? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are overestimating the power of AI; it cannot be truly creative as it cannot be truly conscious.</p>

<p>A good way to see it is like this: for a computer, it is typically easy to do what is difficult for a human (e.g. fast and complex computations), and difficult to do what is easy for a human (e.g. recognizing cats in random pictures). AI is about trying to make it <em>easier</em> for the computer to do easy stuff.</p>

<p>In my estimation AI can certainly be used for oppressive and totalitarian purposes, but we&#39;ll never have &quot;conscious&quot; computers like in the movies (and the central planners&#39; wet dreams), as consciousness does not arise out of matter.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7rtn98/a_very_quick_op_for_people_afraid_of_ai_may_those/">short OP about this last point</a> if you&#39;re interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard this theory and I like it. Because the other thing is, AI needs one thing to thrive/grow/learn: computing power.</p>

<p>What needs computing power and is promulgating its advancement? Bitcoin. </p>

<p>So basically, the theory is that AI created bitcoin so that humans would have an incentive (money) to &quot;feed&quot; it. The blockchain itself is also composed of data, which is another foodstuff for AI. I&#39;m anthropomorphizing AI for sake of analogy, btw, though the other tenet that AI is advanced aliens is an interesting tangent unto itself.</p>

<p>Quinn Michaels was the one that turned me on to this. I binged on his AI stuff for about 8 hours and while I&#39;m on the fence about his views on AI, he definitely puts forth great stuff if anyone else wants to learn more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s suppose bitcoin was created by/ is AI, what is its motivation? What does it want? Growing the raw computational power needed for hashing, the growth of the blockchain itself? What if the coins themselves are worthless to the AI, just a carrot on a stick to make the hoomans build more GPUs and server farms? Maybe it just wants electricity, and coin mining uses tons and demands more. Maybe it&#39;s hubris to assume it has human-like motivations at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! What if its motivations aren&#39;t representative of human behaviour in the slightest? 
Already, we&#39;re talking about an entity which came to be through a sheer coincidence of code and has developed itself for who knows how long. </p>

<p>On top of all that, it&#39;s not limited by a lifespan. As long as there&#39;s a connected circuit, it can exist. It&#39;s like a hive mind. </p>
