        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m a huge fitness advocate who has an incredibly difficult time quitting refined sugars. I study sugar and its addictive properties on my free time, and the more I study, the more I realize how deep this problem runs. Sugar addiction is real. Calling it otherwise is a disservice. This is not fruit sugars mind you, in fact to achieve the levels of sugar consumed from drinking 3 sodas vs eating the equivalent in fruit, you have to make a conscious effort. </p>

<p>Have you ever quit sugar cold turkey? I&#39;m talking quitting white breads that have added sugar, no ketchup, or no sauce? There is a feeling of a crash. It is a real feeling. It is a craving when you quit. I believe that sugar is hard to quit because not only is it added to almost every food in America, but because we are forcibly addicted at such a young age to it that its actually altered out biochemistry. Ever notice how cartoon characters absolutely loathe healthy foods like vegetables and fruits, but go for sugar like its actually cocaine? I think that these cartoon producers are paid for this by major corporations. I mean the international corporation known as Coca Cola has a net worth of  $171.81 Billion, and its literally flavored water. With sugar. </p>

<p>Almost every breakfast I had as a kid, was cereal. Cereal with cartoon characters on the box. Cereal that contained massive amounts of sugar. The first 2 ingredients on the box for most cereals: Corn meal, sugar. Every Sunday morning before church, pancakes with syrup. My mom would drop me off at daycare every morning: not enough time to prepare breakfast? No problem, grab a bag of mini doughnuts from the gas station. Not to mention Kool Aid, Hi-C(advertised and famous for having a high vitamin c content), peanut butter(Jiff, which has loads of added sugars vs natural) and jelly(not real jelly, loads of added sugars), Kid Cuisine, Snack Packs, Ice cream sandwiches, even school pizza sauce.</p>

<p>It runs deep. We&#39;ve been indoctrinated into sugar addiction. If you even tell people this they will defend it like you&#39;re trying to take away their life.</p>

<p>America is the most obese country in the world and that is an undisputed fact. In the world. Its not because we have so much food, its because there is a literal drug that has caloric value that&#39;s put into most of the food we consume. For the sole sake of addiction.People crash off of sugar, that&#39;s a real thing. In my eyes, thats a drug. It lifts you up, and if you don&#39;t maintain the high, you will crash.</p>

<p>This is being made fun of , and fat acceptance is a real thing. I&#39;m not, nor will I ever, hate on people for being obese. I was obese, in fact I was 200lbs at the age of 14. I was * Morbidly * obese, because the food my mom fed me, but I will not just accept it.  i will not lay down and die.</p>

<p>I was most certainly, like most Americans, addicted to sugar. It was only broken when I moved in with my father and he forcibly broke it off. It has to stop, this is a real humanitarian crisis, and I say humanitarian because it is a human rights violation. It violates a right to a healthy existence. Especially when its pushed on children. Especially when information is purposefully suppressed on the issue, and has been proven time and time again! That sugar in high doses, which is extremely easy to achieve, is absolutely the cause of obesity , heart disease, and diabetes. There is a reason a career in health care is so profitable right now. We are being screwed by these people who only want to make money on us! They only want us addicted so we will buy their product. </p>

<p>Same goes for colorful candies. And advertising. (Why do you think  so many <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fast+food+logos+red+and+yellow&amp;amp;ia=images&amp;amp;iax=images">fast food logos feature red and yellow</a> so prominently? That&#39;s the color of ripe fruit.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, we are. Look at your body hair. Pre-tool humans were a tropical species. In the tropics, fruit grows year-round. Without tools and fire, you can&#39;t hunt. Fruit is just laying on the ground, a ready food source.</p>

<p>Plus our entire digestive system is virtually identical to other frugivore primates.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking obvious once you past all the cultural conditioning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually took some Human evolutionary history classes at Uni, and the your correct that our thin small body hair is adapted to warm climates.  However you are completely wrong about us being herbivores.  Bipedalism combined with small hair PLUS MORE SWEAT GLAND DENSITY all over our entire body lends itself to persistence hunting.  It allowed us to literally run animals to death because our bipedalism was more efficient over long distances and our superior cooling system allowed us to stay cool while other animals overheated.  This means we are omnivores with an important emphasis on animal foods in many seasons of the year.</p>

<p>Your on the right track in saying we are eating the wrong food to for our species but exclusively fruit is terrible.  the most similar is a paleo diet, which actually, your vegetarianism + eggs and fish is actually a completely viable form of paleo.</p>

<p>Sweat gland density is appropriate for tropical climates. Gets hot as balls here. And bipedalism is nice for picking fruit off branches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pre-tool humans and all that isn&#39;t really a good point. We&#39;ve been using tools over a million years if not many millions of years. And we&#39;ve adapted to using clothes in cold climates which the sweat gland density argument also applies to cold climates now.</p>

<p>And neither is canine teeth. Canine teeth are really only useful for inflicting stabbing wounds and having scissor like biting. Canine teeth aren&#39;t even necessary for fruits of vegetables.</p>

<p>Bipedalism and picking fruit off branches isn&#39;t either. The user you talked to switched from picking fruit from off the ground to off of branches. Which is it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it matters. Our bodies are designed for a particular type of food. Just as chickens are. Just as cows are. Just as tigers are. Feed any animal the incorrect food for its species and its health will suffer. (Ever wonder why house pets get cancer? Hmmm maybe cats aren&#39;t meant to be eating kibble.)</p>

<p>Our bodies are not able to process all the toxic byproducts of meat, for example. And we can&#39;t extract sufficient nutrition from grass. We&#39;re &quot;designed&quot; from teeth to anus to run on mostly fruit.</p>

<p>This is just theory:</p>

<p>When rabbits where introduced in Australia, no animals attacked them because they were foreign. They just bread and get spawning till it became a problem. To me that show that animals don&#39;t touch what&#39;s not familiar, so an Eskimo coming to Africa might not be attracted to the environments food.</p>

<p>Asian and milk, terrible rate of lactose intolerance. Do you think drinking milk for long enough would cause damage to their body?</p>

<p>Idk, I&#39;ll eat bugs if it&#39;s all chopped up in a granola bar without me knowing, but I&#39;ll never just eat one. Maybe <em>I</em> shouldn&#39;t eat a large amount of bugs. It&#39;s easy to eat something when it&#39;s colourful and pretty, even if it&#39;s junk.</p>

<p>This one guy who pushed an alkaline diet claimed that you should eat what god put around you.</p>

<p>My bad for completely being off track.</p>

<p>Too your point: have you heard Alex jones talk about the chicken and the hawks (IIRC).  The chickens weren&#39;t scared of the birds at all, until they traumatized a couple generations, then the new borns where terrified on first sight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on your reasons. General health and simplifying life or trying to heal from an illness asap?</p>

<p>Start with one fruit meal a day if you can take time. If you go full fruit right away, expect a healing crisis and low energy for a while. Body&#39;s got to reset and after that you&#39;ll be golden.</p>

<p>Find tasty fruit. This is important as taste signifies nutrition. You will not have enough willpower to eat 3 meals a day of low quality fruit.</p>

<p>Bananas are a good transitional fruit. It&#39;s fairly easy at first to mono meal 5-10 bananas and they fill you up fast at more than 100 calories per banana.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re like me you&#39;ll need fat in your diet to feel an assertive libido on frugivore diet. Thank God for avocados. I play sports and high carbs only is not for me at this time. However your genetic makeup may differ. Don&#39;t be afraid of fat is what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>YouTube. Find some frugivores you like. They have good info. Vegetable Police is funny and has much experience, though he&#39;s doing one meal a day starch-based right now. Robert Morse, ND, too. He loves talking, but he&#39;s one of the all-time greats and he has much, much sciencific knowledge for why and how fruits are best for man.</p>

<p>Just go slow and keep adding more fruit over the weeks and months. Embrace the detox symptoms. It means bad stuff is leaving your body and you&#39;re building a strong foundation.</p>

<p>Coconut meat is a good starter food too. Easy to get a full feeling as a coconut is 1000-1400 calories. It&#39;s hard to overeat on fruit. I wouldn&#39;t worry about too many calories.</p>

<p>Mangos are good. Grapes are great for cleansing. Blueberries and watermelons are amazing too. They will detox you hard as they work very well on a cellular level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s conspiracies all the way down when it comes to sugar, and all the way back to the 60s at least. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/">All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic.</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one is more recent:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coca-Cola came under fire Monday for donating millions of dollars to a nonprofit that has been spreading the message in medical journals and through social media that the blame for America&#39;s obesity epidemic is not about diet but a lack of exercise.</p>

<p>The issue, the New York Times reported, is that the view is misleading and meant to deflect attention away from recent studies about sugary drinks and their link to obesity and Type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>“Coca-Cola’s agenda here is very clear: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/08/10/coca-cola-is-funding-obesity-research-with-a-biased-message-nutrition-experts-say/?utm_term=.5d408b2523cd">Get these researchers to confuse the science and deflect attention from dietary intake,&quot; Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at New York University, told the Times.</a></p>

<p>So do you think that a company who makes a product that nets them billions a year in not only sales but also in subsidies, won&#39;t skew research info to come out smelling like a rose?

<p>several years ago, I went from 240 lbs to 160 lbs. </p>

<p>In about 3.5 months. </p>

<p>With no exercise.</p>

<p>How? I basically cut out all refined carbs. No sugar, bread, pasta,  potatoes, rice, honey, or sugar subs. </p>

<p>And I looked and felt amazing. a couple of years later, because of financial reasons, I had to start eating that junk again. and in one year I went back to 230 lbs. I&#39;ve since gone back down to the low 200s, still nowhere where I should be. and all because of starches/sugars.</p>

<p>Sugar blocks magnesium and calcium absorption and accelerates vitamin d deficiency resulting in further sugar cravings.</p>

<p>Lack of sugar leads to sugar cravings because your body literally needs sugar.</p>

<p>High salt intake or pasta causes sugar cravings because salt causes hormonal imbalances triggering a sugar craving and pasta is quickly metabolized leaving your body wanting more energy.</p>

<p>No one is addicted to sugar, but a healthy diet has sugar in it because it&#39;s essential. People just realized it tastes good so they keep eating it. Now that the common populace knows how terrible it is we&#39;ve seen a massive rise in healthier eating, preventative care, and exercise.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, the sugar industry funded research that downplayed the risks of sugar and highlighted the hazards of fat, according to a newly published article in JAMA Internal Medicine.</p>

<p>The article draws on internal documents to show that an industry group called the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to &quot;refute&quot; concerns about sugar&#39;s possible role in heart disease. The SRF then sponsored research by Harvard scientists that did just that. The result was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967, with no disclosure of the sugar industry funding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not OP but I started with the main problem for me, Fast Food.  Fast food is ridiculous...it really is. Refined sugar, flour and no real nutrition...everything advertising the newest drink (sweet tea, shakes, coffee drinks), to combo &quot;savings,&quot; is geared toward you having a sugary drink.  </p>

<p>My second phase was to stop the big ones at home, mainly: bread, potatoes, and pasta. I didn&#39;t quit all sugar, but started stepping down the Soda, and gradually started diluting my OJ and Juices if I was having those.  Full strength OJ now tastes sickly to me. Now I try and drink water. Pasta wasn&#39;t too hard, but I do miss french fries...oh sweet fries.</p>

<p>And it sucked, but kicking fast food (and eating out in general) made the next phase easier.  The thing that made me keep going was forming a habit - if you do something 21 days in a row, it tends to stick, my habit was cooking simple things in record time (due to prepping ingredients).  I found new recipies for myself that didn&#39;t include bread, pasta, or potatoes and found new ways to enjoy vegies. A snack (or even a meal sometimes) for me is: Handful of mixed nuts, slice of cheese and a few vegies, I find it hits the spot.</p>

<p>It was fucking hard, but after a while I just got into the habit of eating the 5 or so new keto friendly meals that I rotated for myself, and learning how to prep.  I do have a crutch, because it is true sugar is like a drug and the addiction is real! Stevia - it is an amazing sugar substitute, and I don&#39;t use it but for flavored drinks or in coffee if I&#39;m craving. I hate sugar substitutes, but love stevia. I recommend it if you are like me and tend to not like substitutes.</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry for rambling, just exited that the evils of sugar are getting more attention, and for sharing my path. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to lose weight before last year...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Piggy backing here to add that because sugar is so addictive that when you do get it out of your diet, your taste buds and brain are going to be pissed and they will tell you what you are eating is gross and bland and boring. If you are not accustomed to eating fresh foods, give it time and do not get discouraged. Your tastes will change. If you aren&#39;t used to eating vegetables, try them all and cooked all different ways until you find some you like. Personally, roasted veggies are my favorite because they get caramelized and brown and so yummy! If you chose the keto route, do not be afraid of fat. Butter is fucking delicious and adds flavor to those bland vegetables. </p>

<p>I eat way less and feel more full after eating foods with fat.
I never ate vegies then also found they are pretty good if you roast them! My parents ate mushy over cooked broccoli and other not-so-great recipes leading me to believe they didn&#39;t taste good...I just needed to explore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for sharing! I just found out I gained quite a bit of weight over the last year and I&#39;ve finally snapped and decided I need to change how I eat because I&#39;m now in a constant state of depression based on how I look now. I look in the mirror and I don&#39;t recognize myself. </p>

<p>I&#39;m addicted to sugary junk food and candy, I&#39;m not a good cook so I just eat easy junk food. I&#39;m also a very picky eater so finding food that I like is going to be hard. My main concern is breakfast tho, I&#39;ve been eating cereal in the morning for my whole life and I&#39;m not a morning person so figuring out something easy and healthy to eat in the morning is a big concern for me.</p>

<p>Did you exercise while on the keto diet or was it 100% diet for you?</p>

<p>According to my doctor I need to lose like 50 pounds and having to lose that much weight really scares me, and is very intimidating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t exercise at all. Even less activity initially because I felt ill from not having sugar and/or combination of that and the keto flu.</p>

<p>After some months I lost enough weight I started to low impact exercise like walking my Labrador more. (My knees were terrible, rice crispies going up and down stairs, and I&#39;m no spring chicken) </p>

<p>Snacking was also a problem for me, so I fill up on water or eat keto frendly snacks - a surprisingly delicious one is microwaveable Lowry&#39;s pork rinds...they come out hot, crackling like mad and are keto friendly and freakin&#39; delicious. They come in what looks like microwaveable popcorn bags, packaged just like them. I get mine from amazon, they sell &#39;em in 10 or 20 packs I think.</p>

<p>Another tip: I found if I really need something to tide me over: Low carb Shake: protein powder (you can find low/zero carb powder), a bit of Stevia sugar substitute, and a splash of some half-half. I just mix it up with a fork with a glass of water.  I know the half-half sounds fatty, but it is better than milk according to what I&#39;ve read, and I use it in coffee and in other things instead of milk. Fat isn&#39;t all terrible, as is known, and I do frequent those foods instead of carbs.  I have found that even though I&#39;m eating more fat, the fat actually fills me up and I eat less, and keeps me satiated longer.  I&#39;m a sucker for meat, bacon, and those things so I definitely use a lot of those.  As has been pointed out by others, low carb oats, some grains, and vegies are still totally ok to eat on keto.  The sugar though, I think is universally the bad guy in most all the diets/methods.</p>

<p>So here are a couple recipes that I make that are keto friendly, I&#39;m not the greatest but I manage now - perhaps you could take on a challenge of cooking one or two easy meals that you have ingredients ready to go? I made it a game to see how fast I could cook, finish cleaning the pots/pans in the time the food was cooking, and have only my plate to clean, making the end easy. Preparing your fridge to have an assembly line of vegie/ingredients to make your meals helps.</p>

<p>Here is one for me - Open face chili burger.  I buy a stack of frozen burger patties from Costco, they have a few different kinds, just have to find the one you like.</p>

<p>2 strips of bacon, cook bacon, set aside
Cook 2.5 mins on each side two frozen burger patties (no need to thaw, cooking time may vary)
At the end of the frying, sprinkle a bit of cheddar cheese on the burgers (or after the chili if you prefer)
Add chilli to the top of the burgers
Add vegie sides (I typically cut up a cucumber, some tomatoes, or just make a simple salad), I prep my vegies for easy usage</p>

<p>*For the chili, I make homemade on Sunday&#39;s from seasoning, 1 lb hamburger, can of stewed or chopped tomatoes and just a bit of beans but most often no beans added.  I have a tupperware ready to go with it in the week to add to dishes like this one.</p>

<p>So that is the first one I made up, and just practiced until I got good at it.  For breakfast my go to is a two egg mushroom omelette or a the protein shake from above. I made the omlette cooking a game by seeing if I could do a tri fold without fucking it up. I&#39;m ok at it, and suprisingly have gotten pretty quick at belting one out.</p>

<p>And just a disclaimer - I am no dietician, and am just relaying what has worked and benefited myself.  Some might be a little wary of the increase if fat consumption, but I believe the research I&#39;m reading saying it actually is needed by the body, but am aware of the ill effects as well.  I don&#39;t think its reputation as the bad guy is warranted, especially if you&#39;re replacing it with sugar like the processed snacks are.</p>

<p>Hope this helps and good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(not OP)</p>

<p>People differ. But what I&#39;d emphasize to anyone trying Keto is to make sure you&#39;re getting enough fat. A 65-70% fat diet actually takes some effort, and people shrink from this due to a lifetime of bad information.</p>

<p>But the high fat is not only necessary to replace the carbs (the goal being to fix insulin resistance and train the body to run on ketones), BUT it will also go a long way to making you feel satiated.</p>

<p>Sugar withdrawal will still suck (&quot;keto flu&quot; is common - look it up), but getting lots of fat helps a lot.</p>

<p>IMHO the proper partner for Keto is <em>intermittent fasting</em> (look it up.) Breaking the hold of sugar and carbs makes that doable, whereas it would be hellish otherwise.</p>

<p>I know, i know. Ive used a trigger word that is likely to piss everyone off just by reading it. But! </p>

<p>If we all went vegan, our resistance to antibiotocs would drop 75 %. America&#39;s biggest killer, heart disease, would drop to... Well, to 0.  No more cholesterol, no more plaque buildup. The meat and dairy industries have funded studies to say &quot;carbs cause heart disease&quot;, but we all know thats bullshit right?</p>

<p>We could also undo massive damage to our environment. Look up how many tonnes of carbon emissions are directly due to animal agro.</p>

<p>And hell if you just hate the word &quot;vegan&quot; substitute it with &quot;plant based&quot;. I&#39;ll post more details and sources later, am on mobile</p>

<p>Heavy cream, yes absolutely. It cuts the bitterness, amplifies the aromatic flavors of the coffee, and provides awesome mouthfeel. Sugar is grainy in your mouth, drowns out any actual flavor in the coffee, and sugar simply doesn’t work with bitter tones. Would you put sugar on spinach? That’s like putting sugar in coffee. </p>

<p>Not high specific, but eggs. Eggs literally have all the nutrition needed for life (of a chick, but still). The average egg is 70ish calories and super filling. Next time you&#39;re eating think about how many calories you&#39;re eating and compare how full and satiated you are compared to that many calories in eggs. You can do this with any wholesome food with similar results. It&#39;s pretty easy to eat 500 calories of candy but 4 or 5 eggs will have you feeling way more satisfied for longer.</p>

<p>Hey listen though...</p>

<p>The first three days are the hardest.  You get cravings like a madman.  Then the next three days are shitty, but not as hard-- because you feel sick.  That&#39;s the die off of the sugar-loving bacteria in your gut, and as they die off they drop poisons that make you feel like you have the flu.  This is called a Herxheimer reaction.</p>

<p>After that, things start to improve.</p>

<p>So if you can set yourself up in a situation where you can get through six days, you can make it through the &quot;sugar withdrawals.&quot;  And you only need the second three days off work or whatever.</p>

<p>To mediate this, eat ENORMOUS quantities of fat.  Like way more than you think you should.  Eat half a bar of butter on your eggs.  Scarf down avacados.  Don&#39;t even count the calories-- breaking the sugar addiction is priority #1.  The fat makes it all easier.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, after about 30 days, you pass a point of no return.  Food you previously enjoyed starts tasting too sweet and garbagy, and the only reason you might go back on sugar is because you remember it as a comfort food (and thus re-addict yourself if you get miserable).</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth doing!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but I&#39;m not sure why. I think that i has to do with not being heavily processed and retaining some benefits of it&#39;s original form. Not sure the truth behind it, but local honey is thought to reduce allergy symptoms by exposing you to local pollen in a less overwhelming form similar to immunotherapy. Honey has also been used as a medicine for it&#39;s antibacterial properties as far back as ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>I&#39;d more chalk this up to processed sugars being that much worse for you than natural sugars (i.e. fruits and honey, which still should be consumed in some moderation). Perhaps the hormonal effects are different. It warrants further research.</p>

<p>Honey and Maple syrup have roughly double the glycemic index as fructose, which is still less than half that of maltodextrin. Could be that relative to modern engineered sweetener it&#39;s not as harmful.</p>

<p>These might be related ... If you still want to stay vegan be sure you&#39;re getting enough protein and good fats which is what you&#39;re missing out on with meat/dairy. Fat and protein are both necessary for proper hormone production. Still try to limit carbs and switch what carbs you do eat from sugary and processed to non-processed/slow digesting sources. High fiber &gt; starches &gt; whole grain (if you have to). In terms of fat and protein, nuts and avocados are great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! You have motivated me to challenge myself to go off of processed sugar. Again. I&#39;ve done it before and it&#39;s hard as hell. Actually, my diet used to be clean and healthy for quite a while, but I&#39;ve fallen off the wagon these past couple of months. I&#39;m craving for sugar like a madman and I can feel the difference in my body - it feels so bad. And yet I crave for more sugar. The addiction is real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just six days!  Work to get through those!  After that it&#39;s steady improvement, and DO!!!! NOT!!!! forget the fat!  (And I said elsewhere, if it becomes impossible, try using maple syrup and honey exclusively as your sweeteners-- it will extend your time to get off sugar completely, but it&#39;s a helluva lot better than not getting there at all).  If you do take honey or maple be sure to cut them with a lot of fat too!</p>

<p>BTW, each time you fall off the wagon, it gets a little easier to get back on.  I&#39;m at a point right now where even during the Christmas season (when I almost always fall off just because we end up swimming in candy) I don&#39;t fall &quot;too&quot; far and can get back on afterwards with minimum withdrawal.</p>

<p>Once you clean up your gut, it DOES take time to recolonize, and I don&#39;t know if this is actually true, but I THINK the withdrawal cravings (and certainly the painful parts) are driven by the bacteria.  So the less there are, the easier cleaning up is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I found is switching to loose leaf tea. Tea became a hobby. I bought a teapot and everything($20 on Amazon). I would go to the tea store and make a trip out of it. Jasmine green, Oolong, white tea, Earl Grey black. Each ounce of tea was maybe $2. I love tea so much. I&#39;d steep it while I played games. I need to get back into that.</p>

<p>If you cant do that I would recommend diet soda and black coffee. Diet isn&#39;t good for you really, but its a start to something healthier to get the cravings down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a diet soda alternative called Zevia, which is Stevia sweetened and didn&#39;t have caramel coloring or the other chemicals you often find in typical sodas. It&#39;s definitely more expensive, but they offer a wide range of flavor and you can often find it &quot;on sale&quot; for 3.99/6-pk. Again it&#39;s still pretty pricey, but it&#39;s an excellent alternative if you still crave soda. Also, for me, I don&#39;t drink coffee so it&#39;s how I get my caffeine and my carbonation. Thanks for the excellent post!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I disagree with the diet soda suggestion. Studies have shown that people who drink diet soda have more and greater cravings for sugar and fat, and become acclimated to artificial sweeteners&#39; much sweeter flavor profile, making it less likely that they reduce their sugar consumption.  </p>

<p>That said, if you&#39;re going to use an artificial sweetener xylitol seems the best choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you can try to cut back on sugar like a smoker can cut back on cigarettes, but it will just be a struggle. You really kind if got to go cold turkey, at least at first, and get through the withdrawal stage which takes 3-5 days.

    <div class="md"><p>There is a strain of thought among some ketogenics that just adding good fat alone will improve your diet. You’ll end up with less cravings for sugar, they smooth out insulin spikes from sugar and natural fats basically cannot ever become human fat. I never gave it much thought. But now I basically don’t exercise and never calorie count and eat some sugar or starches here and there, but I’m keeping the weight off by prioritizing high fat foods. Even though my sleep schedule is messed up (a bigger cause of obesity) and I eat when I’m not hungry all the time, it’s mostly high fat foods and I’m not putting weight on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;v worked in a fairly upscale restaurant that did catering on the side. We&#39;ve done events for 600+ people and served fairly complex dishes. Putting out good for large groups of people is not impossible but requires a lot of prep time and skill.</p>

<p>I think for public schools it mainly comes down to what is the cheapest option due to budget constraints. To put out good food on that level requires a lot of work (payroll) and quality ingredients (fresh, unprocessed which will go bad if you don&#39;t plan accordingly). If you&#39;re just heating frozen prepared meals up that cuts down your payroll cost significantly (less hands required, and less time needed for prep/ cooks get paid less due to not requiring skill - though some cafeterias do pay pretty well) and is generally cheaper than the ingredients required to prepare that same meal fresh. Not to mention you can buy larger quantities (if you have the freezer space) and generally get a lower price as well. It comes down to school lunches having to be affordable. Most school lunches cost the student less than $5 and to break even on that with fresh ingredients and a higher payroll would be a very difficult task. I think we should look to France or Japan as a model to base our school lunch system on. </p>

<p>I am unhappy about this even though I personally don&#39;t eat these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what happens when school lunches are left to third parties. They want to make it as cheap as possible and still keep the kids happy, so unhealthy food full of refined sugar. The war on fat hasn&#39;t helped either, so companies started replacing fat with sugar which is way worse.</p>

<p>A simple solution is for parents to start making their own lunches for their children. It is really common in Europe, to the point where a lot of schools don&#39;t even offer lunches any more. Throughout elementary and middle school my parents would make me healthy whole grain sandwiches with turkey, ham or cheese every day. In high school I would make my own. It only took them 5 minutes per day and I will do the same for my children.</p>

<p>Also interesting to notice in countries where children are addicted to simple sugars, there are much more mental health issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, I&#39;m going against the grain here, but public schools around me tend to serve much better food than what y&#39;all are talking about, and it&#39;s an extremely impoverished district. Kids get chicken biscuits, sausage and eggs, fresh fruit, etc. for breakfast every day, alongside natural fruit juice. They drink milk too (milk lobby is a pretty huge deal, every kid had to drink milk!), but the produce is second to none.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, OP.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been saying stuff like this on this sub for a couple weeks now.</p>

<p>I also had a life-changing experience with sugar. Im not overweight and never have been, have a metabolism and activity level that allows me to eat basically anything and never get fat.</p>

<p>But about 5 years ago, a coworker told me to &quot;watch out&quot; When he saw me eating a bag of Skittles, as I often ate candy late at night while we were working. I asked him what he meant and he said, &quot;try going one week with zero added sugar&quot;. I absolutely thought he was crazy and that I would have no problems with it.</p>

<p>First thing I noticed is that actually finding products in the store that don&#39;t have added sugar (or an alternative, or enriched wheat flour) is really hard. The ones without added sugar tend to be the most expensive.</p>

<p>Next thing i noticed is that I was craving sugar within 24 hours like a crack fiend.</p>

<p>Eliminating that shit from my diet has been amazing. My 3 year old son gets virtually no added sugar either and he&#39;s a picture of health.</p>

<p>Last thing I&#39;d like to say is that I&#39;ve been making comments about sugar/obesity epidemic/lobbyists in context to all the gun control threads.</p>

<p>We have &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; on this sub who are losing their shit over the idea that 15k people get shot to death in the US each year... the NRA is the devil...</p>

<p>Yet they don&#39;t give a shit that the food and beverage lobby, the healthcare lobby, and pharmaceutical lobbies are all spend more lobbying than the gun rights lobby, have more &quot;revolvers&quot;, or former politicians turned private lobbyists, than the gun lobby, <em>and</em> that we have an estimated 678,000 preventable deaths due to nutrition and obesity related illnesses.</p>

<p>It blows my fucking mind and looks badly like astroturfing to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This should be on the front page but people do not want to accept this...I was 366lb..I cut sugar from my diet completely and have lost 100lb so far and feel amazing. I didn&#39;t do some diet..I just cut the sugar and everything else fell right into place. Portion sizes decreased and I no longer had the intense food cravings I&#39;ve had my whole life.. especially for sugar and refined carbohydrates. I can easily control myself now and I&#39;m disgusted at the amount of food I was capable of consuming. I consider sugar a drug as the first week I had &quot;withdrawal symptoms&quot;..headache, irritability and feeling lethargic..but the day that passes I felt great and it&#39;s just gotten better over the past year. This is just my experience.. everyone is different... anyway... Fuck sugar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s how they&#39;re turned into sugar and what kind of sugar. Starchy/refined carbs get turned into glucose pretty much immediately and are quickly used up by your body. They spike your blood sugar levels and result in insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome over time. It&#39;s why you get addicted - it&#39;s an easy, readily available source of glucose for your body, and after the sugar high fades, you need another hit.</p>

<p>I wish our society wasn&#39;t so fucked up and backasswards. Earth could support  15 billion people no problem if we allocated natural resources appropriately. Or used a form of clean/free energy to support the needs of that many people. Instead, we live in a fucked up world where the Elite purposely attempt to delete as many people from earth (subtly and directly) to slow the natural growth of population.  </p>

<p>The sugar lobby is the people who <em>grow sugarcane</em></p>

<p>The food and beverage industry are the people putting it into... You guessed it... food and beverages.</p>

<p>You know, coca cola, et al? The industry that has literally lied to consumers about sugar for decades and has conspired to suppress studies on sugar. The sugar crop industrydidn&#39;t do that. It was the food and beverage industry.</p>

<p>Dude you&#39;re really knocking these opportunities to make yourself look stupid out of the park. What else you got?</p>

<p>Btw, before this conversation you made 4 comments total to this sub on 6 years. You&#39;re here in bad faith to push propoganda and fearmonger about guns, plain and simple.</p>

<p>I like that you&#39;ve changed your argument, rather than just admitting you were wrong. Really mature, big guy.</p>

<p>The gun lobby spends a lot of money. Not even fucking close to the food and beverage giants like coke and nestle... those two companies <em>alone</em> outspent the gun rights lobby in 2017. These are the companies <em>who put the sugar into their products</em>.</p>

<p>Thanks for making this sub a worse place by trying to ignore and downplay <em>actual conspiracies</em> that result in 670,000 deaths per year, while pushing politically divisive propoganda about guns.</p>

<p>Have fun with your little fringe issue, but probably best not to outright lie about it in the future and make yourself look like a paid astroturfer.</p>

<p>I know that this is probably a fruitless exercise since you&#39;re not here out of concern about conpiracies, but rather to push your political agenda and generate fear about guns. I expect nothing but more deflection, goalpost moving, and apologetics for the food and beverage industry.</p>

<p>Dude, stop pretending like you&#39;re a regular here or know anything about this sub. 6 comments in 6 years, and now you&#39;re here talking about &quot;classic conspiracy&quot;. Give me a break. How do you expect anyone to look at that and not think astrotrufing?</p>

<p>You&#39;re not making sense. I make comments about the 15,000 deaths vs 670,000 deaths frequently on this sub, ever since we started getting innundated with gun control propoganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>get called out</p>

<p>Called out? You just limp-wristedly asserted I was pushing a political agenda. Then, when I called out on that statement and engaged with data in order to open a discussion, you immediately started deflecting, lying and backpedaling.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You pretended I was saying something about George Soros, right? Classic conspiracy.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t call you a shill, I just pointed out that you&#39;re engaging in astroturfing techniques. Obviously, people can make of that what they will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually went cold turkey with regards to refined sugar for 6 months in August 2016, when I learned about keto. This included not eating bread. The feeling is definitely strange and it&#39;s not easy to get used to it. I lost about 9 kg within a month, which I guess is the water weight retained for processing carbs. Then I visited my aunt, who made me spaghetti, I couldn&#39;t refuse and got all that weight back within 2 days.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t realize how ubiquitous sugar (carbs) really is, it&#39;s literally everywhere, it&#39;s compact, easy to cook, eat, transport and store. You simply can&#39;t get off of it but you can balance it out with healthy, satiating stuff so you don&#39;t have cravings.</p>

<p>However, if you just want to maintain your weight or even gain weight, then keto might be a little too much for you. Carbs are generally fine. For example, oats, rice, noodles and bread without any added sugar are totally fine to eat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is talking about refined sugars, which are very different then carbs. Carbs are what the body breaks down into glucose and uses for energy. Carbs . The keto diet is a low carb diet. Carbs are not just sugars. Carb heavy items that do not have much sugar includes potatoes, bread, pasta, and soooo much more. These have little to no sugar, but a ton of carbs. So essentially what I’m saying is the keto diet doesn’t just cut out sugar its cuts out most carb heavy items as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I listed Fathead because part of that movie has a comparison of the amounts of sugar in breads, pastas, etc (sugar being what the wheat breaks down into, like how if you chew a cracker long enough it gets sweet).</p>

<p>To properly break the sugar chain (which involves killing off your bad gut bacteria that colonized you because you were a high sugar environment) you really need to cut out that stuff and just get your carbs from vegetables or sweet potatoes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, keto is awesome for weight loss and a necessary reset for many people who have been binge eating sugar for most of their life. Ultimately it should be a gateway to to getting to a normal weight then transitioning to eating better whole and less sugary foods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are exactly ZERO essential carbohydrates.</p>

<p>While cycling in and out of ketosis is fine for people with a healthy body weight, eating a &quot;healthy&quot; food pyramid diet isn&#39;t optimized nutrition.</p>

<p>Our ancient ancestors would not have had access to the sugary results of selectively bred fruit (&quot;wild&quot; varieties having little resemblance to domesticated kinds), and would not have had milled grain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I am just saying that keto is great for losing weight, but it&#39;s just not for everyone who wants to maintain or even gain weight.</p>

<p>This is because: </p>

<p>1) food like meat, fish, nuts etc. is very expensive (at least it is in Europe; I think in the US meat is significantly cheaper) and because of</p>

<p>2) health reasons. I did keto for about 10 days and during that time, I got sincere concentration problems and I experienced migraine with aura 2 times, although I took additional potassium. If your keto simply cannot work while doing keto, I don&#39;t think you should keep trying to force it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be a complete addict. Used to drink more then 6 0.5l pepsies or coke every day, or 3 litres of any juices (that too contain sugar and are not actually healthy for you at all). And ate chocolate like crazy. No water in months.</p>

<p>When I got to 100 kg, I decided its time to put an end to this, and boy, turns out that withdrawal from sugar is a real bitch. I was literally dying every day for a month. My body and my mind craved it more than anything else.  Hands were shaking, I was sleepy and depressed all the time, my brain just didn&#39;t know how to live it with out at first. It took me many tries and fails until I&#39;ve stopped drinking it completely. </p>

<p>After that I finally understood the importance of water. It doesn&#39;t have a taste. It doesn&#39;t give you callories. It&#39;s the only thing that is not food. 
I am still losing weight, already lost 10 kgs in two month, going to gym soon (I literally couldn&#39;t go before, I simply had no power to actually lift anything or run while my brain was still being accustomed to life without sugar). Gotta say, even now, every time I see Pepsi, Coke or Ice tea, I still dream of drinking it, just like in that fucking commercial. It&#39;s really deep in your brain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bravo, OP! Much applause for this post. And extremely true. The mass addiction comes from overgrowth of Candida in our bodies, which feed on sugar. Candida and its effects are major causes of a lot of the food-related diseases we see growing today.</p>

<p>And it was all so that major commercial food manufacturers could substitute fat for sugar to increase &quot;flavor&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to get back on AIP for a second time for the past couple months after taking a break in November, and I have to admit, the cravings and addiction are worse this timr around than they were when I was going AIP the first time, and Ive broken it many times.

    <div class="md"><p>This is so wrong. </p>

<p>Keto flu can occur in some people when they transition to the keto diet. Once the sugars are depleted in the body (think 2-7 days after you stop ingesting carbs and sugar) your body flushes out tons of water and takes necessary electrolytes with it. This is not the same as a sugar crash and the keto flu is easily mitigated with supplementing sodium, potassium and magnesium.  Keto flu is not a sugar crash. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have stopped eating a ton of foods just because of the amount of sugar they have. I stopped drinking soda a few years ago because of kidney stones, but I have since felt entirely different just from quitting. But I can elaborate on the side effects of quitting sugar cold turkey. About a year ago my girlfriend and I had to be on a strict diet for about a month so that we could do an Ayahuasca session. We weren&#39;t suppose to eat anything with refined sugar........just finding food was hard enough. Not only that, but we both started getting fevers and headaches and body chills. I felt like I legitimately was coming off of cocain addiction or some sort of stimulating drug. Thats when I realized how bad this was for me. And I cracked down on not eating so much of it. And that&#39;s before even bringing up the fact that meats and high sugar intake along with dairy also relate to most of the cancers we now see so frequently</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sugar industry paid scientists in the 50’s to blame “fat” instead of sugar for health risks. I came to the realization that I was addicted to sugar and that the sugar fed my depression. Started by doing some research after putting 2 and 2 together and came across a Doctors’ video on YouTube called “The Bitter Truth”. I believe his name is Robert Lustig and he even has books on the subject. That opened my eyes last year and I changed up my lifestyle by eating Keto and cutting sugar for a bit. At first it was insanely hard, but I felt so much better, better than I ever had at just one week of not eating sugar. My skin cleared up, the pounds melted off, I slept better, AND my mood swings/depression was under control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I urge anyone interested in this issue to start with &quot;Sugar: The bitter truth&quot; by Robert Lustig. He has a lecture at the University of California outlining the chemical implications of ingesting refined sugars and the underlying economic motivators behind their proliferation in foods. </p>

<p>This is not a trivial or peripheral issue, folks. This is one of the greatest deceptions ever imposed upon the western world and it has ramifications all across the board. We have been poisoned and manipulated in the name of profit, and the conspiracy lies in the complicity of our regulatory agencies who lied to the public and vilified fat as the culprit of modern nutrition-related disease.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no coincidence that sugar cultivation and the sugar trade was a major source of wealth for TPTB. The crusader military orders (like the Knights Templar) cultivated sugar and sold refined sugar back to Europe, growing wealthy in the process. The Knights Templar was at the time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar">a kind of proto-multinational corporation.</a>. </p>

<p>Sugar was also an important element in West Indies trading routes (slaves traded for sugar). It is a sad but notable fact that wealthy Jews were in control of the slave trade but also the sugar trade, as they owned many or even most sugar plantations and refineries. And I say that as someone who was raised Jewish. </p>

<p>So the song remains the same, as it has for well over 1,000 year: TPTB control sugar and use sugar to control us. </p>

<p>In a relative sense, there is. Cigarettes have warning labels on them; sugary foods instead have colorful images and cartoon characters on them. The fat content in food always has its % Daily Value listed; sugar does not.</p>

<p>Why the suppression of that information? Obviously if you list the % Daily Value for sugar, it&#39;d turn out to be 300-500% of the FDA-recommended daily amount. That would hurt the sugar companies&#39; bottom lines badly.</p>

We have a pretty neat “sugar tax” which punishes businesses and consumers who pick sugary products by simply making them less affordable. Partially thanks to this tax, Pepsi Max (Black/Zero in some markets) is now the most consumed soft drink. I wonder what would’ve happened if USA (2/3+ of adult population overweight) introduced something similar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your stance on sugar free soft drinks? Pepsi Max, Diet coke etc etc.</p>

<p>I know there are still various additives and chemicals that don&#39;t make them much better than the high sugar/corn syrup mainstream soft drinks. I also realise the healthiest way to live your life is to cut out the soft drinks all together. But is drinking this as harmful?&gt;I&#39;m a huge fitness advocate who has an incredibly difficult time quitting refined sugars. I study sugar and its addictive properties on my free time, and the more I study, the more I realize how deep this problem runs. Sugar addiction is real. Calling it otherwise is a disservice. This is not fruit sugars mind you, in fact to achieve the levels of sugar consumed from drinking 3 sodas vs eating the equivalent in fruit, you have to make a conscious effort. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever quit sugar cold turkey? I&#39;m talking quitting white breads that have added sugar, no ketchup, or no sauce? There is a feeling of a crash. It is a real feeling. It is a craving when you quit. I believe that sugar is hard to quit because not only is it added to almost every food in America, but because we are forcibly addicted at such a young age to it that its actually altered out biochemistry. Ever notice how cartoon characters absolutely loathe healthy foods like vegetables and fruits, but go for sugar like its actually cocaine? I think that these cartoon producers are paid for this by major corporations. I mean the international corporation known as Coca Cola has a net worth of  $171.81 Billion, and its literally flavored water. With sugar. </p>

<p>Almost every breakfast I had as a kid, was cereal. Cereal with cartoon characters on the box. Cereal that contained massive amounts of sugar. The first 2 ingredients on the box for most cereals: Corn meal, sugar. Every Sunday morning before church, pancakes with syrup. My mom would drop me off at daycare every morning: not enough time to prepare breakfast? No problem, grab a bag of mini doughnuts from the gas station. Not to mention Kool Aid, Hi-C(advertised and famous for having a high vitamin c content), peanut butter(Jiff, which has loads of added sugars vs natural) and jelly(not real jelly, loads of added sugars), Kid Cuisine, Snack Packs, Ice cream sandwiches, even school pizza sauce.</p>

<p>It runs deep. We&#39;ve been indoctrinated into sugar addiction. If you even tell people this they will defend it like you&#39;re trying to take away their life.</p>

<p>America is the most obese country in the world and that is an undisputed fact. In the world. Its not because we have so much food, its because there is a literal drug that has caloric value that&#39;s put into most of the food we consume. For the sole sake of addiction.People crash off of sugar, that&#39;s a real thing. In my eyes, thats a drug. It lifts you up, and if you don&#39;t maintain the high, you will crash.</p>

<p>This is being made fun of , and fat acceptance is a real thing. I&#39;m not, nor will I ever, hate on people for being obese. I was obese, in fact I was 200lbs at the age of 14. I was * Morbidly * obese, because the food my mom fed me, but I will not just accept it.  i will not lay down and die.</p>

<p>I was most certainly, like most Americans, addicted to sugar. It was only broken when I moved in with my father and he forcibly broke it off. It has to stop, this is a real humanitarian crisis, and I say humanitarian because it is a human rights violation. It violates a right to a healthy existence. Especially when its pushed on children. Especially when information is purposefully suppressed on the issue, and has been proven time and time again! That sugar in high doses, which is extremely easy to achieve, is absolutely the cause of obesity , heart disease, and diabetes. There is a reason a career in health care is so profitable right now. We are being screwed by these people who only want to make money on us! They only want us addicted so we will buy their product. </p>

<p>HFCS isn’t a refined sugar, it’s a mixture of fructose and glucose, pretty similar to honey (although in a different proportions, hence ”high fructose”).</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I too spent a long time addicted to sugar. Funny thing is, I don&#39;t even really have a sweet tooth, but sugar is everywhere. Other unhealthy, high calorie foods are everywhere too.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s so extreme. We can&#39;t ignore proportion sizes either. People eat well past what they need to. Portion sizes are crazy.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity not too long ago to spend a summer in Europe. I didn&#39;t consciously try to improve my diet, but settled into the local norms. I lost quite a bit of weight and after the first week or so, I didn&#39;t feel starved or short changed on food.</p>

<p>Addressing sugar addiction and the forces behind it is a vital step, perhaps the most important single step, tbh. But I also think we have to take a deep look in the mirror and address some of our cultural choices as well, such as huge meals and serving sizes. </p>

<p>When the person in charge of food services places their orders with the distributor, they have to make a conscious decision to order ice cream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They might be under contract to order the ice cream though.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the school board approved a vendor contract because it was so cheap they ignore the ice cream and soda riders.  Coca-cola makes contracts like this with schools all the time where they give donations in exchange for a contract that forces the school to install vending machines.</p>

<p>And now that I&#39;m just over a month, I still get this little nagging thing in my head to &quot;just have a little treat.&quot;  Like, I don&#39;t consciously want a sweet treat - I feel full and satisfied- but there&#39;s this little voice telling me to eat something sweet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some things I agree with, but there is also a lot of BS in your post.</p>

<p>What I agree with: Marketing targeting children with sugary cereals is fucked up. Marketing targeting children should be against the law. And sugar addiction is real.</p>

<p>Bullshit parts: No one is &quot;forcing&quot; this onto you. It&#39;s the product of effective marketing targeted at young people, and parents being unwilling, not knowledgeable enough step, or can&#39;t (in a financial sense) step in and say &quot;no, we are going to eat healthy.&quot; My kids get next to no TV time, and even they know all about these sugary cereals and when we pass them in the store, they want them. Remember, battling obesity and advocating for legislation to combat this was <em>the</em> big thing for Michelle Obama, and Trump is shitting on that by rolling much of it back at this time in the name of &quot;repealing regulation.&quot; A healthy work force is a more productive resource, and there is no reason, conspiracy or otherwise, that the government would want a less productive work-force.</p>

<p>BS 2: American is not the most obese country in the world. We are probably the most obese <em>western</em> country, but by mean body mass index, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_body_mass_index">we just sneak in the top 20 and are 12 when it comes to percentage obese.</a> Obesity is a problem here, no doubt, there is no reason to lie about the numbers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More people need to talk about the problem of overconsumption of sugars and carbs. I started making life changes about a year ago, and quit sugars completely 5 months ago now, and I lost 40lbs, and my &quot;fat&quot; weight is still on a downward trend.</p>

<p>If anyone in here is looking to quit too, you should know that the first 3 weeks are the hardest. But you must resist all temptation and push through. Then try to change your eating habits to avoid all carbs: potatoes (and root vegetables in general), pasta, rice, breads, and the sweetest fruits and fruit juices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK... so I understand that regular and excessive sugar consumption is bad.  Reading through this thread, it would seem that many other adults also understand this.  Federal Nutrition Standards for School Meals now clearly articulate an understanding of this:  <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-01-26/pdf/2012-1010.pdf">https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-01-26/pdf/2012-1010.pdf</a></p>

<p>So I&#39;m missing the conspiracy here.  How are we being &quot;forcibly addicted&quot; when it is clearly general knowledge that diets that are high in sugar are bad?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A big problem is that damn food pyramid they shove down our throats (&#39;scuse the pun). It&#39;s lopsided heavily towards grains, which have the most added sugar contents, broadly speaking. It demonizes fat as the major contributor to weight gain and obesity, while writing off sugar as some sort of happiness supplement.</p>

<p>A wise woman once told me &quot;you can eat a whole bag of raw sugar, and it&#39;s fat free.&quot; I think that resonated with me because she&#39;s right, sugar is inherently fat free. But the synthesis of simple sugars in the human body stores that &quot;energy&quot; as fat. And thanks to a sedentary lifestyle encouraged by televisions, video games, and other stationary distractions, that &quot;energy&quot; is never used. Thus, building up to what is now known as obesity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Substitution. My dad made me substitute ketchup with mustard, since mustard is so readily available. That was back when I still ate a lot of bread though. Nowadays I make a sauce based on crushed tomatoes and seasonings, such as italian seasoning, curry powder, red pepper, or anything I think will taste good really, but still maintain a lower calorie and healthier alternative. Some people hate salt. I don&#39;t really, so I use soy a lot. Also, since vegetables and fruit tend to go bad fast, I buy them frozen. I usually make a stir fri with the vegetables, or just eat frozen blueberries plain since they make an excellent desert. </p>

<p>Always read the nutrition labels and ingredients if you want to avoid sugar. Jiff I used to think was a health food until I read the label and realized they added a bunch of unnecessary ingredients. All natural peanut butter? Peanuts, and salt.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of effort just to even avoid sugar, but if you stay diligent, its possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On top of the spine there is a brain center known as &quot;limbic system&quot;. It houses primal urges, violence, hunger, lust, greed, aggression and all sorts of insanity (coincidentally, this might be the &quot;predator brain&quot; Castaneda&#39;s Don Juan referred to).</p>

<p>In our everyday lives, the limbic system gets dibs on every action that happens. If you feel a craving, it&#39;s because IT craves sugar, not you. Just like a feral dog, it snaps suddenly and does its own thing unless you learn how to manage it.</p>

<p>Observe your behavior at all times and surround yourself with people who are no aggravating to the limbic system. Also, stock up on healthy snacks and never run out or the limbic system will just engage the autopilot and you&#39;ll find yourself having bought and eaten sweets without even realizing it.</p>

<p>You Americans (and others with the same problem) really have to do something about your eating habits. </p>

<p>When i got my small appliance for making bread the recipe for bread said to put x amount of sugar. It was fucking sweet! Bread! The thing that should be a staple of a simple savory meal like a sandwich, not a cookie. I ended up using 40% of the sugar mentioned in the recipe and the next loaf was much much better.</p>

<p>Also, eating anything sweet for breakfast should be frowned upon. Sweet stuff should only be eaten to &quot;sweeten&quot; your meal you already ate, not as a meal itself, or as a snack. Cutting of on soda would help immensely as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the conspiracies I actually believe with my whole heart. Everything down to even our food pyramids is affected and lobbied by Big Corn and Big Sugar. Hell, Coca-Cola funds &quot;health studies&quot; (which incidentally find that there are &quot;no associated risks&quot; with sugar and human health). And you know what? Physician representatives <em>accept</em> this. They <em>shill</em> this. It&#39;s disgusting and an aberration of medical ethics. Some physicians, and many politicians, are paid lots and lots of money to promote or allow such heavy intake of sugar.</p>

<p>Sugar cravings and their associated health implications meet the clinical criteria for addiction. I wish more people saw and understood this. But what chance does the layperson have when they lack the information to understand sugar&#39;s toxicity, and the resources to find alternatives? It is so deeply disturbing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s one of my major gripes with Capitalism in general is that the &quot;prize&quot; that we all strive for is the dollar, without ethics or caring about the well-being of others, if the dollar is the cumulative end goal, people will always come second. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think human beings do shitty things unless it&#39;s for power or profit and sugar is a ridiculously easy profit creator. </p>

<p>The Japanese, if you compare their vending machines with the United States, have less sugar sweetened items and more green tea/water items to choose from - is this because of culture or government that has an emphasis on the well-being of it&#39;s people? I&#39;m not sure but there is a significant difference in their weight statistics. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been studying diet/nutrition for about five years now and it&#39;s such a fascinating thing how American&#39;s buy into fad dieting but it makes sense, we&#39;re trained to be consumers. </p>

<p>Backed up? Buy fiber
Have a cold? Buy medicine
Have Diabetes 2? Take insulin
Have extra weight? Get bariatric surgery</p>

<p>Ansel Keys was able to convince a US Governor that fats were killing us with no evidence yet we took it hook, line, and sinker and then breads became the base of the food pyramid. It&#39;s absolutely looney. </p>

<p>Worse than that, since the 1970s, we&#39;ve slowly been trained to eat MORE, instead of the Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner, we&#39;re told we need to eat more smaller meals, this is the key to weight loss! However, it goes against evolutionary context. It doesn&#39;t make common sense. The only sense it makes is to consume, spend, and buy more. </p>

<p>Study the insulin system within the body, glycemic index, and fasting - when you understand how your body uses insulin as the &quot;fat gatekeeper&quot; - that&#39;s the jump off point to understanding, imho. </p>

<p>If I get a bit tin foil hat, Tom Naughton, who created the simple yet brilliant documentary, Fathead, has been dealing with constant attacks on his website and he has one of the best, simple videos explaining insulin:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNYlIcXynwE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNYlIcXynwE</a></p>

<p>Dr. Jason Fung, an advocate of different fasting protocols, when he first started getting into the research of fasting, was confronted by his patients and when he prescribed them insulin for type 2 diabetes and they mentioned &quot;Why would you prescribe something, after telling me that I need to lose weight, that will create weight gain?&quot;</p>

<p>Even health care is meant to suck you dry of your currency - we&#39;ve become a commodity and a vessel to have our resources dried to please our corporate gods. </p>

<p>Dr. Shawn Baker (meatheals.com) was an orthopedic surgeon, one of the top folks in his practice, started offering people ketogenic dieting as an option as a preventative measure to the surgeries that he performed. </p>

<p>He was noticing he would see less inflammatory if people would eat keto, even to the point where they were reversing arthritis - the hospital got wind about it and they black-balled him for doing what a doctor that takes the Hippocratic Oath, heal the individual under your care. </p>

<p>Reason why? He wasn&#39;t selling enough surgery. You can hear the entire story toward the last 3/4 of this podcast:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj_Bc9hdHa0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj_Bc9hdHa0</a></p>

<p>Preventative measures for the body take away markets and in my experience, companies with a lot of money will use any means necessary to please the almighty dollar... 
the oil industry... 
sugar industry... 
Big pharma... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main takeaway from this gentleman&#39;s post is that fasting has the same effect on insulin levels in the body as keto and exercise. Do all three and eat 1-2 meals a day, no snacks in between to taper off your insulin levels. More reading material:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This directly correlates to the demonetization of fat in the diet as well as the misguided and outdated food pyramid. I struggled for 35 years with a roller coaster blood sugar. I was raised on sugar cereal. It was a staple food. I could not keep myself satiated because I was starving withing a couple of hours of eating sugary/high carb foods. It wasn&#39;t until I switched to a higher fat/cruciferous vegetable diet that I found out what a flat blood sugar level felt like-heaven! I always thought the food coma after a meal was from the fat in in-no, it was from the insulin dump. Not only have I lost weight, I feel so much better. No more yoyo blood sugar levels.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to have a real sugar problem. By used to, I mean a few days ago. I would have something sweet literally every day. Sometimes I&#39;d eat an entire bar of chocolate or a pint of ice cream. Every time I saw vegan sweets I hadn&#39;t yet tried, I felt like I had to have them. I would get starbucks lattes several times a week. It was bad. Just three days ago I decided I&#39;ve had enough and chose to stop eating it. I had cravings the first day so I bought some date rolls and would have one when I wanted something sweet. The weird thing is, I haven&#39;t had any cravings since then. Added sugars are easy to avoid when you eat mostly whole foods which is the way to go. I mean I&#39;ve struggled with giving it up for years but once you make up your mind about it it just becomes what you do. Doing research helps. Sugar is the devil and I&#39;m actually really excited about eating healthier and feeling better. You can do eet! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone in medical school the thinking has changed, doctors that were my dads age used to say fats were bad.  They are NOT they keep you full and your body processes them just fine.  We now recommend you reduce carbohydrates (sugars) as much as possible.  </p>

<p>Now personal opinion I honestly think high fructose corn syrup is the devil, it’s addicting AF and extremely hard on your body.  Also your body doesn’t realize how full it is (how many calories you’ve eaten) because fructose doesn’t go through the appetite regulatory enzymes.  Also it’s inflammatory to your body </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m on the boat with you bud. Grew up in this culture where sugar isn’t just an ingredient, it’s a way of life. Conditioned from a young age to think that what is ‘good’ are the Snicker’s bars and Slurpees and that vegetables were something you tortured yourself into eating.</p>

<p>But then I found myself in middle age, feeling like death, no energy, constantly struggling. I have trained BJJ and MMA for years, so you would expect my cardio to be exceptional, but for some reason I just kept gassing out faster and faster sparring.</p>

<p>Maybe I have cancer I thought since that is what WebMD told me. One blood test later...BAM! Type II diabetes. You never realize that sugar is just a slow poison until it is too late and you don’t realize how much of an impact it has on your life until you try to cut back. Anyone who says sugar withdrawal isn’t a real thing hasn’t been through it.</p>

<p>I’m not saying the occasional treat like a piece of chocolate or a slice of cheesecake is the devil. We only live once and these things are enjoyable. My argument is that we need to change this indoctrination into a culture of excess that is inevitably fueled by those who benefit from is being sick and lethargic. I think everyone on this sub knows exactly what I mean.</p>

<p>As for me, I’m done living that way. I’d rather be able to live longer and remain competitive in my life and sport than to be shackled to maintaining unhealthy blood sugar levels. Has the trip been easy? No. But we all have an ethical obligation to free ourselves from the chains that bind, and this one is bigger and tighter than most think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>American bread, coca cola, and ketchup have more sugar in it than other countries do.</p>

<p>This is mostly because the American pallet craves sugary things more, and are more likely to buy things that taste better to them (sugary). The response from large corporations is to put more sugar in food to increase sales.</p>

<p>The result is a viscous positive feedback loop of Americans craving more sugary foods, and corporations putting more sugar in the food to increase sales.</p>

<p>It not a conspiracy as much as Americans just like sugary foods. The consequence is that children grow up thinking that food SHOULD taste sugary.</p>

<p>If it really was conspiracy, then the rest of the world would have this problem too. We just do it to ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is. Sweetness is completely natural. They just prey on that fact with things that aren&#39;t even natural. </p>

<p>We can reach a point I believe by boycotting, through campaigns like this, and treating it as an addiction to refined sugars. Packing our kids lunches, taking the unhealthy foods that have added sugars, and unnecessary added fats, out of the kitchen. Increasing the demand of whole foods so that they are forced to meet the supply.</p>

<p>Educating people, especially people that don&#39;t have access to healthy nutrition, on the long term benefits of switching, especially to those who don&#39;t have knowledge of the situation.  We will tell them our personal anecdotes, and we will show them how to live a longer and freer life. If everyone does their part, then the market will change. It will be hard to get everyone on board, especially those working 2-3 jobs and raising a family, but we can&#39;t let this go on. Those tend to be people hit the hardest as well.</p>

<p>WE control the market ultimately, despite what companies tell you. WE will get these politicians to change this, by demand. </p>

<p>Just like the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the people will demand fair treatment, and receive a lot of pushback from the other side, but eventually the government will have to follow and give us what we want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this post, OP.  People need to wake up to this.</p>

<p>I was SUCH a sugar addict.  Candy every single day.  Snack products with sugars.  So many carbs.  I did Whole30 a year ago during a challenge at my gym and was forced to cut out sugar entirely.  It was VERY hard the first few days, but after about 3 days, I didn&#39;t crave it constantly.  After the 30 days ended, I had lost 10 lbs I didn&#39;t know I had to lose, and felt like a million bucks.  I continued to eat Paleo after that and felt great.  For the most part now, I rarely have sugar (maybe once per month I have one big sugary treat) and if I do add sweetener, it&#39;s honey or pure maple syrup.  The sugar addiction is a real thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t a conspiracy. Refined foods are easier to make in volume, easier to shape into fancy creative figures, easier to package, easier to prepare and eat, and easier to eat and digest.</p>

<p>Getting off cereals and instant meals requires a higher budget for food and more time to prepare your meals yourself. Good for you if you can afford that time and money.</p>

<p>For those of us who cannot, just remember there is little difference between the sugar you get from refined grains (cereal, bread) and the refined sugar in sodas and candy. Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose very quickly. Which leaves you craving more because your gut is empty. If you want to change how you eat, you need more fats in your diet, less carbohydrates, and fewer total calories. Fats take longer to digest and will leave you feeling full for longer, reducing your cravings for more food and helping you eat less.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend more protein and be careful with fats, especially ones from dairy. Cheese is murderous to the waistline. Instead, eat unsaturated fats and only eat them to taste, don&#39;t overdo it. Athletes get 50% calories from protein, 45% from carbs and 5% from fat.</p>

<p>But I think that with our high sugar first world diet, we&#39;re cultivating fungi/bacteria in our bodies that thrive on sugar. So after years of sugar consumption, we&#39;re packed full of these microcultures. The craving comes when you quit because you are carrying critters inside you that are taking all your blood sugar, so your body is freaking out a bit.</p>

<p>Eventually the cravings level off because the microcultures dwindle and your blood sugar level balances out.</p>

<p>Yep. Also note that there are microorganisms that can change your behavior (toxoplasmosis from cats comes to mind) meaning that the nasty baddies invade and pretty much take over your reasoning.

    <div class="md"><p>Bad food is all around us. It&#39;s almost impossible to ignore. I&#39;m reading this book right now called <em>Head Strong</em> by David Asprey, which talks about which foods are good for your brain (and body) and which are bad. From inflammatory foods &amp; sugars to toxins, it&#39;s crazy the amount of &quot;bad&quot; shit we consume as Americans without thinking. All inorganic produce is sprayed with gnarly pesticides, tons of stuff (e.g. coffee) contains mold toxins, all grain-fed animal meat is bad for you, all gluten is inflammatory (whether you are sensitive to it or not), all sugar is keeps you in glycosis (vs. ketosis) so you will constantly crave sugar for energy and never burn fat for energy. I tried to find some god damn decent organic salad dressing and, even though there were several options, 90+% of them had some type of vegetable oil in them!! It&#39;s completely fucked. You really need to be on your toes when it comes to nutrition in America. I need to make some serious lifestyle choices before I can get my health back on track.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not so much about sugar, but about additives to kids&#39; meals. </p>

<p>Summer of 2009 I worked at a summer camp in Ct, as a kitchen staff. Often we would follow specific dietary restriction for the whole school, and specific requests. This one time the school shipped a bucket of something and it needed to be mixed in with all the food items we served them for all 3 meals every day for their whole stay. That week meals for the staff were cooked separately. I asked the Chef, and his words were &quot;it&#39;s so they don&#39;t run around like crazy&quot;. I was a server there, so I don&#39;t know much else, but it looked like brown goo, like a very thick bbq sause, but with no smell or taste. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s so much more to it. From what I gathered, the teeth have piezoelectric properties, meaning they generate electricity when pressured. So, sugar destroys teeth, which means you lose the natural chewing action and avoid solids, going for the drinkables the likes of Soylent and such.</p>

<p>I went to my dentist a couple times and he casually remarked, &quot;You seem to have an awful lot of wear on lower 6 front teeth.&quot; I eventually pushed him to suggest a solution and we made a mold for a mouthguard to be worn at night. He said I&#39;ve got bruxism, an involuntary grinding of the teeth at night, so I wore the mouthguard and I slept without turning or waking up for the first time in what seemed like decades.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been wearing it for 2 months and it&#39;s already battered, it&#39;s incredible the forces involved. I&#39;ve also noticed I started to really gnash on foods since I started avoiding sweets and doing healthy diet. I&#39;m telling you, there is something about the chewing action that is healthy and that we need on a daily basis, but sugar circumvents that and also destroys teeth. It&#39;s brilliant in how comprehensively it ruins health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldnt agree more. My wife and I started a low glycemic diet and I&#39;ve never felt better. We even make sure our daughter stays off the sugar as much as possible, though that can be hard at times. Though I have to say it has made us get creative with meals and treats, using stevia, monkfruit or other sugar substitutes for baked goods and snacks. And of course shopping for food takes longer since i have to read every ingredient they have on the box.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I challenge you to quit added sugar. Completely. Just eat fruit, and vegetables to get your carbohydrates, along with nuts. Read every single label of food that you come into contact with and avoid sugar as well as high fructose corn syrup. You know white bread? Our STAPLE FOOD. Avoid that. If you want to eat bread, only eat 100% whole, no HFCS bread. Dont eat ketchup either, loads of sugar. Your body is going to reject this Your body will fight, and that&#39;s from experience. I challenge you to do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok back up for a sec. I challenge you to quit beef fat, if you don&#39;t stop eating stuff made with beef fat I will conclude that beef fat is an addictive drug. This is what your argument is but it doesn&#39;t make any logical sense. You can make it for literally any food. Yea they add corn syrup to bread to boost caloric content, it doesn&#39;t make it <em>literally</em> addictive. Does it taste good and make you want more? Yes it does. Is it physically addictive like nicotine and opiates? No it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I think sugar addiction is very similar in many ways to the addiction we have to our phones and to social media in that there are certain interests out there specifically targeting our individual weaknesses in order to strategically exploit our mental vulnerabilities and entice us into consumption of their products. </p>

<p>This is why it is extremely important for us to talk about these issues and discuss and share our own strategies that may help us navigate the world in such a way that we are able to avoid these traps.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an American and I see this in a lot of places and went through it myself. A lot of people are either willfully ignorant, know but cant really change anything, or know and boycott it. If you go to a dollar store in America, which is, shit, the only store in some poor neighborhoods, good luck finding anything at all without added sugars. Hell, even the fruit cups and healthy options have added sugars. Open your eyes.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve personally done diets clean of refined sugars and process foods. It is rough. The first week you literally feel like you&#39;ll never satisfy your hunger and that you are weak and getting the flu. There is some serious physical withdraw. Not to mention even hours after eating sugary foods you have an isulin dump and end up feeling hungry again shortly after even though you just ate plenty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you not tried a ketogenic diet? I&#39;m also seeing other similar diets that focus on various benefits - for example FODMAP, or going low residue. Also heard about someone yesterday focusing on mucus and eating a meal a day similar to the warrior diet.</p>

<p>When I could afford going casual keto, I could choose how many meals a day I was eating, sadly eating different from everyone else in the family gets pricey so probably have to wait another 6 months to get back on it completely.</p>

<p>Suggestion, go get a flavor of Zevia soda you like and replace a single soda daily. The 6 packs of cans are like $5. I bet you will see positive change from just that. Personally I also get packs of Polar seltzer water because I love the orange vanilla flavor, however it&#39;s not sweet at all. Other tips: unsweet tea or coffee and add in a sugar alternative, distilled water to me doesn&#39;t taste like shit other bottled water, drink mixes like the True Lemon brand which can be found at Dollar Tree, and those little squirt flavor things like Mio.</p>

<p>Just eliminating sugar from your softer drinks shouldn&#39;t be too hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote a paper a couple years ago in college about the obesity epidemic in America, and I found some pretty alarming statistics regarding the topic. Within the research, I found that being poor and of color significantly increases your chances of obesity in America. In fact, Mississippi had the highest obesity rates in the nation when I was doing some research at the time, and they also had some of the lowest average annual household incomes. One of the craziest statistics that I read was that a little over 50% of black people in Mississippi are obese. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To anyone looking to quit sugar, lookup &quot;keto diet&quot;. Around 20g of carbs a day, adequate protein and as much fat as you need to hit your calorie target. First week it&#39;s tough to not eat the foods you&#39;re used to but only because you&#39;re used to them, there&#39;s <strong>no withdrawal</strong>. Fat and protein are very satiating and GOOD FOR YOU. Fat being pushed as something that&#39;s bad for us is a conspiracy against humanity. The keto diet is famous for weight loss and detoxing.</p>

<p>You know how when you get hungry you get kind of mad, weak and have difficulty focusing? That isn&#39;t normal, that&#39;s sugar withdrawal. That doesn&#39;t happen on a keto diet. Or how after you workout your muscles are sore for days? That&#39;s due to lactic acid being produced from the glucose in your body. Did you know that sugar weakens your immune system considerably? Did you know that sugar causes inflammation?</p>

<p>It definitely restricts a lot of the foods you can eat but totally worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I am just saying that keto is great for losing weight, but it&#39;s just not for everyone who wants to maintain or even gain weight.</p>

<p>This is because: </p>

<p>1) food like meat, fish, nuts etc. is very expensive (at least it is in Europe; I think in the US meat is significantly cheaper) and because of</p>

<p>2) health reasons. I did keto for about 10 days and during that time, I got sincere concentration problems and I experienced migraine with aura 2 times, although I took additional potassium. If your keto simply cannot work while doing keto, I don&#39;t think you should keep trying to force it.</p>

<p>These might be related ... If you still want to stay vegan be sure you&#39;re getting enough protein and good fats which is what you&#39;re missing out on with meat/dairy. Fat and protein are both necessary for proper hormone production. Still try to limit carbs and switch what carbs you do eat from sugary and processed to non-processed/slow digesting sources. High fiber &gt; starches &gt; whole grain (if you have to). In terms of fat and protein, nuts and avocados are great.</p>
