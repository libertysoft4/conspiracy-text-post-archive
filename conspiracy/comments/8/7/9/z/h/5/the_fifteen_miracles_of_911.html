<li><p>The Twin Towers and WTC 7 were the only steel-framed high-rise buildings ever to come down without explosives or incendiaries.</p></li>
<li><p>The Twin Towers, each of which had 287 steel columns, were brought down solely by a combination of airplane strikes and jet-fuel fires.</p></li>
<li><p>WTC 7 was not even hit by a plane, so it was the first steel-framed high-rise to be brought down solely by ordinary building fires.</p></li>
<li><p>These World Trade Center buildings also came down in free fall – the Twin Towers in virtual free fall, WTC 7 in absolute free fall – for over two seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the collapses of the of the WTC buildings were not aided by explosives, the collapses imitated the kinds of implosions that can be induced only by demolition companies.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of WTC 7, the structure came down symmetrically (straight down, with an almost perfectly horizontal roofline), which meant that all 82 of the steel support columns had to fall simultaneously, although the building’s fires had a very asymmetrical pattern.</p></li>
<li><p>The South Tower’s upper 30-floor block changed its angular momentum in midair.</p></li>
<li><p>This 30 floor block then disintegrated in midair.</p></li>
<li><p>With regard to the North Tower, some of its steel columns were ejected out horizontally for at least 500 feet.</p></li>
<li><p>The fires in the debris from the WTC buildings could not be extinguished for many months.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the WTC fires, based on ordinary building fires, could not have produced temperatures above 1,800℉, the fires inexplicably melted metals with much higher melting points, such as iron (2,800℉) and even molybdenum (4,753℉).</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the steel in the debris had been sulfidized, resulting in Swiss-cheese-appearing steel, even though ordinary building fires could not have resulted in the sulfidation.</p></li>
<li><p>As a passenger on AA Flight 77, Barbara Olson called her husband, telling him about hijackers on her plane, even though this plane had no onboard phones and its altitude was too high for a cell phone call to get through.</p></li>
<li><p>Hijacker pilot Hani Hanjour could not possibly have flown the trajectory of AA 77 to strike Wedge 1 of the Pentagon, and yet he did.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides going through an unbelievable personal transformation, ringleader Mohamed Atta also underwent an impossible physical transformation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These are sourced from David Ray Griffin&#39;s book, <em>Bush and Cheney: How They Ruined America and the World.</em></p>

<p>Additional miracles:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The claim that the passports of the alleged hijackers Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al Ghamdi- said to be on United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania- were found on the ground of the crash site, even though nothing else at the site suggested a giant airliner had crashed there. Nothing was visible because the plane, which descended at 580 miles per hour, buried itself deep into the ground. Nevertheless, both passports escaped at the last millisecond and fell to the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>The claim that the passport of the alleged hijacker Satam al-Sugami was found at the site of the WTC&#39;s North Tower, meaning that the passport escaped intact after the plane perished in a giant fireball. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many unanswered questions. I agree, but aren&#39;t you just repeating the same exact questions that have been said in your verbiage since 2001. And I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve been told the whole story. But I&#39;ve watched many documentaries from both points of views.

    <div class="md"><p>My reasoning behind posting these 15 miracles was to hopefully initiate a conversation amongst the community to see if any of these have been debunked, if any of these can be supported with further evidence and if any other miracles should be added to the list. To get all of our ducks in a row. </p>

<p>As for the Popular Mechanics documentary, it explains away any type of foul play regarding the collapse of WTC7 with two reasons they claim were established by the final report of NIST. </p>

<ol>
<li>It was a result of physical damage from falling debris.</li>
<li>It was a result of prolonged exposure to (diesel jet fuel fed) fires. </li>
</ol>

<p>However, it turns out that neither element the documentary provides was affirmed by the NIST report. The final report states:</p>

<ol>
<li>&quot;Other than initiating the fires, the damage of the debris had little effect on initiating the collapse of WTC7.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;fuel oil fires did not play a role in the collapse of WTC7.&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>That alone puts the entire Popular Mechanics documentary and every conclusion it supports into serious question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should read Debunking 9/11 Debunking by David Ray Griffin. He takes on the Popular Mechanics book/documentary in very specific detail. </p>

<p>I want to further expand on what <a href="/u/Pube_of_Dionysus">/u/Pube_of_Dionysus</a> said about debunking the NIST explanation of WTC7. NIST originally came out with a report in 2008 stating that WTC7 did not collapse at free-fall speed and they had a computer generated model to support their claim. A few years later NIST was forced to admit that WTC7 did in fact achieve free fall speed but they claimed that their original data &amp; computer model from the 2008 report was still accurate. NIST then refused to release the data they used to support their original claim that WTC7 was brought down by simple office fires for fear that it might &quot;jeopardize public safety&quot;. </p>

<p>Not by a long shot. You can pull this off with a few dozen people. You simply compartmentalize and work on a need to know basis. It&#39;s easy to string people along with a good lie so they have no idea what they are working on.</p>

<p>Basically the only people who would be able to spill the beans are those planning it and those planting the bombs. Everything else is simply smoke and mirrors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, I&#39;m just an Insurance Executive. I don&#39;t have any idea about government cover ups. The main theory which I&#39;ve seen compelling information about the planes being switched in flight with remote control planes. Here&#39;s where I think you have a lot of folks involved. No one reported any of the pilots of the 4 planes weren&#39;t the usual pilots. I&#39;m not gonna fly to an off the map hanger just to be killed. There are so many unexplained questions but I think you are under estimating the number of people in the government and media would have to be involved. That&#39;s my only question. A conspiracy works when there are only a few people involved. I heard it would take several hundred guys to rig 3 buildings that size. That came from demo companies. Again, you might be right about the small number of people needed. I can just think of so many people you would need. So far no one has went to the media so maybe it was a few people</p>

As it stands, your list is deeply flawed, with clumsy wordings, misrepresentations and strange assumptions. In an environment with rational, critical thinkers it would get picked apart, and it doesn&#39;t seem like you would be able to maintain many of the points really, i.e. you would be shooting yourself in the foot, and work against any serious 9/11 truth. </p>

<p>It should also be noted that NIST even admits that they have &quot;no evidence&quot; that this is even true:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since fires were observed on the ground surrounding WTC 7, it is <strong>possible</strong> that <strong>potential</strong> ignition sources <strong>might</strong> have entered WTC 7 through openings created in the south and west face of the building during the collapses of the towers. NIST found <strong>no evidence</strong> to confirm this possibility, but the available data suggest that this was highly likely.” NIST NCSTAR 1-9, page 194</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They just claim it was &quot;highly likely&quot; with &quot;no evidence.&quot; Later on, they actually admit that ignition of the fires is unknown. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For WTC 7, however, <strong>the ignition</strong> and early course <strong>of the fires were unknown</strong> because they were 
presumed to have occurred in the damaged and heavily smoke-shrouded southern portion of the building&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not doubting all the tower may have been controlled demo. If missiles (that looked like planes) hit the towers. Why would 4 airline pilots fly to a site and then someone kiiled all the passengers. What happened to the Air Traffic Controllers? Did they cooperate? How far down in the Bush Administration did this go? How were buildings rigged for demo without anyone seeing it? How many people did it take to rig all 3 buildings? Why have NO journalists find anyone of the thousands who were involved to privately talk ? Was Osama Bin Laden and his group part of the conspiracy? Did Mayor Guiliani know ?  Some Democrats had to have known. They could have practically ended the Republican Party. How far down our Military, FBI &amp; CIA did it go ? Where any foreign governments involved? When the planes or missiles that looked like planes hit the buildings, how did we know EXACTLY were to start the controlled demo in World Trade Centers 1 &amp; 2. Planes or missiles that looked like planes could have hit several floors off of the plan.  AGAIN, I believe this whole thing stink to high heaven. But I&#39;ve never heard anyone answer my questions.

    <div class="md"><p>what about all the amateur video? All CGI?  Would nobody seriously have been filming it and have video that doesn&#39;t show a plane hitting it and go &quot;hey what the fuck?&quot;....They would literally have to track down every person who might have video and silence them.....and why would they risk such an obvious possibility instead of just using real hijackers, or remotely controlling actual planes, etc?  Since when does the government give a shit about loss of human lives?  and why would they care about the loss of life on a plane but not the thousands that were in the building?</p>

<p>The planes could have been modified passenger planes or swapped out for military ones. No planes seems like a wild leap and just gives ammo to the people trying to de-legitimise the conspiracy.</p>

<p>No, moron, unlike you - a bozo - I watched the footage. The explosions aren&#39;t even synchronized properly.  You - a bozo - will NEVER watch the footage. Why? Because you are a bozo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It exactly could have.  How old are you?  Did you grow up in the era of vhs and analogue video?  It was <em>extremely common</em> for a video tape from television or from one vhs tape to another to have “ghost images” sometimes like a double exposure shifted an inch to the left or right.  Sometimes on broadcast sports it would only be moving things like people who shifted while the background was static.  </p>

I have definitely seen videos where the planes look darker and not like public craft so maybe they tried to paint over the jets in widely viewed clips or had a cgi video ready to go alongside candid video released later, I can&#39;t remember if it was September Clues exactly but have seen a frame by frame showing a wing disappearing completely for a second and the hole left by the jet is just to perfect even with a stretch of the imagination the fuselage survived the wings should have been torn off.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was looking into it a bit more and it&#39;s rather hard to even see an object at all in the video of the North Tower, let alone a plane. And in reality they just needed to fool the mass public that there were planes so everybody didn&#39;t think it was bombs, they didn&#39;t really need to worry about eyewitnesses. And although I agree with you that the CGI is unnecessary, that doesn&#39;t mean that people such as myself won&#39;t think it&#39;s the actual truth. Here&#39;s the video I watched: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3shmfKOZ9g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3shmfKOZ9g</a> at about 01:08 you should be able to see the plane coming from the general direction of the camera, but I personally can only make out something for a couple frames before the &quot;impact&quot;, and not really a plane at that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d assume there would be an explosive shockwave as the liquid fuel vapourized and expanded.  But I don&#39;t think something like that would have the force necessary to act as a demolition charge.  Any explosives used to move large amounts of material out of the way, as in construction or demolition, are solids, and specifically formulated to produce shockwaves of incredible force.</p>

<p>The towers were designed to be impervious to plane strikes of that size.</p>

<p>In some videos you can literally see white hot molten metal coming out of the towers before collapse, indicating thermite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the 911 Commission Report, &quot;American 77 was 5 miles west-southwest of the Pentagon and began a 330 degree turn. At the end of turn, it was descending through 2,200 feet.... The hijacker pilot then advanced the throttles to maximum power and dove towards the Pentagon.&quot; </p>

<p>The trajectory of the last eight minutes of the flight was reportedly &quot;flown with extraordinary skills&quot; with &quot;almost military precision.&quot; The Commission even states that &quot;George W. Bush was struck by the apparent sophistication of the piloting, especially the high-speed dive into the Pentagon.&quot;</p>

<p>The Report named the hijacker pilot as Hani Hajour. </p>

<p>The problem is that Hani Hajour was a mediocre pilot by all accounts. The Washington Post published a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/10/15/hanjour-a-study-in-paradox/fce4da67-a6c6-4c2a-b7fa-f1cb9a1fcc6a/?utm_term=.9e5837c87690">story</a> which elaborates on incidences when &quot;instructors questioned his competence&quot;, including the Freeway Airport refusing his request to rent a plane.</p>

<p>His flight school in Phoenix found &quot;his skills so shoddy and his grasp of English so inadequate that they questioned whether his pilot&#39;s license was genuine.&quot; His instructors went as far as to notify the FAA to find out whether his pilot&#39;s license was real. </p>

<p>So Hajour&#39;s ability to pull off such a skilled maneuver is extremely doubtful. </p>

<p>However, many pilots have come forward and have said that even the best pilots in the world could not have pulled off the reported trajectory in a 757, including US Navy pilot with &quot;top gun&quot; training Ralph Kolstad who has said, &quot;At the Pentagon, the pilot of the Boeing 757 did quite a feat of flying. I have 6,000 hours of flight time in Boeing 757&#39;s and 767&#39;s and I could not have flown it the way the flight path was described.&quot;</p>

<p>Before I arrived in the US back in 2003, I was living in Ireland at the time and around 2002 a documentary aired on ITV British TV station about the 9/11 attacks, I don&#39;t recall the name, but in that documentary they stated and showed reenactments of the passengers calling loved ones from the air.

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.</p>

<p>Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.</p>

<p>This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.</p>

<p>The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.</p>

<p>Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?</p>

<p>What does all this say about the American mind?</p>

<p>It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.</p>

<p>Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.</p>

<p>But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:</p>

<p>De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?</p>

<p>Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That&#39;s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don&#39;t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>He further goes on to state:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.&quot;</p>

<p>You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.</p>

<p>Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don&#39;t know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don&#39;t have the courage to do it, because you&#39;re a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don&#39;t have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it&#39;s too big to stop.</p>

<p>Muslim terrorism has NOT ever been typically based around the middle east, nor have &quot;Muslim Terrorists&quot; generally been the favourite subject of US media except under the Bush Presidencies as far as I can remember, (and yet the closeness of the Bush and Saud families has been well attested to).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop being disingenuous by acting like this rhetoric only existed immediately after 9/11.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well I didn&#39;t see much of it, (anti &quot;Muslim terrorists&quot; newspaper reports), before 911 except during terror incidents or wars, or in 1998 when Bin Laden declared war on the USA. Admittedly the US was involved in the middle east for quite a few years, and I certainly didn&#39;t see an undue abundance of what you claim, which was - <em>&quot;Muslim terrorists&quot;. Every day they urge you to go out and kill them</em> -, even though if they are terrorists then killing them would not be an inappropriate response.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that fear of Muslim terrorists has existed all over the medieval world, from the middle east to North Africa, from India to Spain, from Austria to France, and all around the Mediterranean since about ten years before Mohammeds death, or since about 1396 years ago.</p>

<p>Certainly, over the last ten years there has been a concerted hush campaign in Western Media to avoid arousing the irascible Muslim sensitivities for fear of further reprisals on innocent civilians, so the &quot;Muslim terrorists&quot; seem to be winning that particular ideological battle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a controlled demolition, there is noise, visible charges, and usually some outward expulsion, none of which exist at WTC7. 47 columns didn&#39;t collapse all at once. Completely uncontrolled fire cause steel fire very quickly, and the WTC7 experience massive, uncontrolled fires for 7 hours. When steel heats up, it expands, which puts incredible stress on joints and connections. When the connections fail, everything above the support gives way. </p>

<p>This is clearly seen when the penthouse collapses, and through the windows you can see some actual sunlight, which suggests that that area was hollowed out and the frame was still standing. The collapse progressed across the building, removing all of the internal support for the shell. This is demonstrated during collapse when the &quot;shell&quot; bows inward on at least 2 sides of the building, which shows that there was no internal structure present. </p>

<p>My issue in general with the 9/11 bomb or whatever conspiracies is the lack of evidence of anything that would actually clearly show that it was a demolition. All there is to support these claims are observable things like &quot;well, the building fell like a controlled demolition&quot; and &quot;there were important CIA papers in there&quot;...rather than &quot;here is evidence of blasts at the base of the tower despite no sounds&quot; or &quot;we have archived security footage of people bringing bombing materials into WTC7&quot;. </p>

<p>I think those that follow these conspiracies under-estimate what it actually takes to bring down a building in a controlled demolition. </p>

<p>Thermite is aluminum and iron oxide. These elements can be found in the construction of a building. It is not indicative of thermite being using to take down these tall skyscrapers.

    <div class="md"><p>Well I don&#39;t think anyone will ever know exactly what happened, since the buildings once destroyed were quickly shipped off to China before any investigation was done into their failure. But it was assumed the material was used to basically cut the core columns in the building. Not fire ignited, but set off by charges. An unusual demolition choice, but also one that is highly effective. It&#39;s the reason also assumed why such impossibly high temperatures were found at the WTC buildings, and why molten metal steel was found.

    <div class="md"><p>If I&#39;m not mistaken, aluminum melts around 650C, and temperatures were far hotter than that in the building and the rubble. Is it at all possible that the &quot;molten steel&quot; is melted aluminum? </p>

<p>Also, I am struggling to understand just how any of this was supposed to be done? Let&#39;s say there was thermite intended to cut columns...how does it start? Are humans required? Why does the building happen to collapsed exactly from where the planes crashed? Why did the outer structures of WTC1 and 2 both pull inward a second before collapse? None of these things are conducive to an inside job, but are, however, to the notion that fire weakens steel trusses, and causes catastrophic collapse once failure occurs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So again, assuming there was thermite or thermate (don&#39;t know the difference), why do the buildings collapse right at where the plane was impacted and nowhere else? </p>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/911stories/ST1.jpg">https://sites.google.com/site/911stories/ST1.jpg</a></p>

<p>That image shows the buckling moments before collapse. The weight distribution of the tower was completely out of balance due to the plane and sagging trusses. The trusses cause bowing (pulling in the outer frame) and then the weight of the top portion buckled the &quot;pulled in&quot; frame. This does not look like something caused by thermite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you had planned to blow the towers up, it would look ridiculous if it collapsed from the bottom (like wtc7) which was completely undamaged. After the planes crashed the temperature inside the towers couldn&#39;t have been that high because there was a woman actually standing in the hole at the impact site -&gt; <a href="https://i.imgur.com/dIBwTiT.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/dIBwTiT.jpg</a> In fact the WTC buildings were designed to withstand the impact of 707s flying into them, which was the largest commercial jet the time the buildings were built.

    <div class="md"><p>So, they had thermite react to right where the planes happened to hit?</p>

<p>A woman was standing in the impact hole, but there was no visible fire in the impact hole, so it&#39;s silly to assume that just because this one woman wasn&#39;t surrounded in raging fires that there weren&#39;t any elsewhere in the tower. </p>

<p>The WTC was design to withstand the impact of a 707, with low fuel, at a slower speed, not a 747, loaded with fuel, going 500mph. Even then, the WTC DID withstand the impact. They did not collapse because a plane crashed into it. They collapsed because when steel trusses are exposed to flames, they sag. These long span trusses were connected to the outer frame of the building, which carried something like 30-40% of the building load. So when the beam sags, it starts pulling the outer frame in ward (in some places, up to 55 inches). Steel is incredibly strong when holding loads STRAIGHT, but if they are turned or pulled inward even a bit, their integrity is almost entirely removed. This bowing effect is highly documented with the WTC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Offices fires don&#39;t weaken steel to the point they turn into noodles. And even if hypothetically this happened, the building wouldn&#39;t then collapse into the path of most resistance at practically free fall speeds. The millions or so tonnes of buildings below would provide resistance to the weight above and slow or stop the collapse completely. Those buildings have massive redundancy, they are designed so the weight will shift when they move in the wind. Either way, the official explanation doesn&#39;t explain molten steel, or the uncombusted thermate everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The steel didn&#39;t have to be &quot;noodles&quot;. Long span trusses, like those at WTC, absolutely sag when exposed to fire. Just think of the insane mass of the tower placed upon those weakened trusses. It is going to collapse, no question. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.metabunk.org/data/MetaMirrorCache/15d987530fb19f490198129171c8d200.gif">https://www.metabunk.org/data/MetaMirrorCache/15d987530fb19f490198129171c8d200.gif</a></p>

<p>Each individual floor of the WTC was not designed to sustain the dynamic loading when the top quarter or third of the building comes down all at once. The incredible load of mass will push through each individual floor quite easily. </p>

<p>My overall point is that, from a conspiracy perspective (assuming the conspiracy believed says the collapse was triggered on purpose), there are so many things required for it to occur which has zero evidence supporting it. Do you know how many people would have to be in the know about an operation like this for there to not be a single whistleblower providing substantial evidence? Yet the current President cannot even keep his extra-marital affairs secret? </p>

<p>It sounds like you&#39;ve read a decent amount of the conspiracy material, which is good, but I think you should also look into some of the &quot;debunking&quot; material because there is valuable information in there. Not that it will change your mind, but it will certainly make your future arguments stronger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the paper on nano thermate is pretty smoking gun. I don&#39;t think there are any attempted debunkings of it, except to pretend it doesn&#39;t exist. The NIST papers went into great detail to explain collapse initiation, using fancy models. But then completely failed to explain the rest of the collapse of the building. Even with immense loads, the building should have provided some resistance to the collapse, but it provided absolutely nothing. This without some kind of explosive just violates the most basic laws of physics.

    <div class="md"><p>There was resistance though. I have found that on videos that try demonstrate free fall speed with WTC1 and 2, they stop the timer once that rubble coming off the building hits the ground, but the building is still collapsing underneath the cloud of smoke. </p>

<p>I want to see what you think of this photo: <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/photos/docs/hudson_clouds.jpg">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/photos/docs/hudson_clouds.jpg</a></p>

<p>That is the concrete core of the North Tower after collapse. Compared to the Financial Centre buildings, that core standing is nearly 700 feet tall. The fact that the core survived the collapse, to me, shows that the pancake theory is true and that using explosives or something else to take down the building to NOT be true. Trying to explode a 110 story building would certainly require the core to be taken out...</p>

<p>I have read that site up and down. I used to be a bit of a truther, ever since watching the original Loose Change back in like 2008 or so. However, what I found is that in order for the 1 of the theories presented to be true, there would have to be 100 other things required which have zero evidence. That is my issue with it. </p>

<p>I am not some American government apologist. They have done a lot of horrible things in the name of war over the years...however, this is not one of them. I should also mention that a 9/11 conspiracy theory acts on a scale. On one end, some believe the US intentionally did not try stop the planes or the terrorists  because it would allow them to go to war, while those on the further end believe that no planes hit the WTC and that the plane in Pennsylvania was shot down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That photo was taken during the collapse, the core didn&#39;t survive. Actually if you look at the photos of the aftermath the only thing which was left standing was the outer shell at the base of the building, which would make no sense if a million or whatever tonnes of building came crashing down. In fact the whole things was blown to pieces. In stark contrast to wtc7 which collapsed into a neat pile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The core didn&#39;t survive, but it did remain after the collapse for about 5 seconds, which means that blowing out the core was not used in the demolition of the buildings. </p>

<p>I&#39;m confused about what that piece standing shows regarding your theory? Because that piece is standing, that means it couldn&#39;t have fallen without explosives? WTC7 fell in a (sorta) neat pile because of the cascade collapse I described earlier. The internal structure came down, then the shell fell straight down, as gravity would dictate with some that has zero support. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The core standing suggests that the pancake theory is true, and that theory basically says the weight of the floors above crushed each floor in rapid succession, stripping the trusses from the core, leaving the core behind. </p>

<p>As of right now, you haven&#39;t provided any explanation as to why the frame of the building was bowing inward and happened to collapse exactly from where the planes hit, or address the cascading collapse of the internal WTC7 structure, or demonstrate how the WTC was supposed to not collapse despite taking on the enormous dynamic loading of the upper collapse. Now that is what I want to get my head around. Saying &quot;this paper says there was evidence of chemical compounds consistent with thermite use&quot; provides essentially nothing in terms of explaining HOW it was done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you blow the central support columns what do you expect to happen to the outer walls of the building? They are going to bow some direction. The thermate evidence says how it was done. It also gives a credible explanation as to why molten steel was found and why such impossibly high temperatures persisted for weeks. How they were placed we&#39;ll never know exactly, but if you read the news archives there was a lot of unusual work done on the towers in the weeks preceding 911 including one weekend where all the power including to the security cameras was cut.</p>

<p>Two planes crashed into two steel towers at different angles at different heights. Both fell basically into their own footprint.</p>

<p>Hotter fires? Maybe. But no plane hit this building. Debris from the towers hit it? Sure. But these fires were asymmetrical and yet the building collapsed into it&#39;s footprint <em>and experienced a period of freefall</em> all the same. Hotter fires don&#39;t mean shit.

    <div class="md"><p>This is a basic scientific question which you&#39;re trying to answer with hyperbole, ignorance and assumption. The size of an airplane doesn&#39;t have any impact on the temperature of a fire. The jet fuel would produce a hydrocarbon fire with a diffuse flame, and these types of fires have a maximum temperature that is just the same as an office fire.</p>

<p>What you could argue is that the added fuel would create more *heat*, which is different from temperature. But most of the jet fuel burned up on impact, and what&#39;s left was gone in the first few minutes. After that point, we have nothing but regular office fires.</p>

<p>You might also want to look into the evidence that is recovered in the form of the steel, which was analysed to see what kind of temperatures were reached. This evidence has only been around for +10 years, perhaps it&#39;s time to let go of your gut feeling and have a look?</p>

<p>It seems like a rather low probability that it just so happened to be the terrorists passport that survived and not one of the other passengers..
However, in the case of WTC, if al-Sugami was in the cockpit then he might have been ejected as one of the first and shredded in the process but his passport and other things on his body ejected out of the plane and out of WTC as one of the first items before the fireball...</p>

<p>Suqami’s passport survived the attack: a passerby picked it up from the World Trade Center and
handed to a New York Police Department detective shortly before the towers collapsed</p>

<p>The passport was recovered by NYPD Detective Yuk H. Chin from a male passerby in a business suit,
about 30 years old. The passerby left before being identified, while debris was falling from WTC 2. The
tower collapsed shortly thereafter. The detective then gave the passport to the FBI on 9/11. See FBI report,
interview of Detective Chin, Sept. 12, 2001. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a controlled demolition, there is noise, visible charges, and usually some outward expulsion, none of which exist at WTC7. 47 columns didn&#39;t collapse all at once. Completely uncontrolled fire cause steel fire very quickly, and the WTC7 experience massive, uncontrolled fires for 7 hours. When steel heats up, it expands, which puts incredible stress on joints and connections. When the connections fail, everything above the support gives way. </p>

<p>This is clearly seen when the penthouse collapses, and through the windows you can see some actual sunlight, which suggests that that area was hollowed out and the frame was still standing. The collapse progressed across the building, removing all of the internal support for the shell. This is demonstrated during collapse when the &quot;shell&quot; bows inward on at least 2 sides of the building, which shows that there was no internal structure present. </p>

<p>Each individual floor of the WTC was not designed to sustain the dynamic loading when the top quarter or third of the building comes down all at once. The incredible load of mass will push through each individual floor quite easily. </p>

<p>My overall point is that, from a conspiracy perspective (assuming the conspiracy believed says the collapse was triggered on purpose), there are so many things required for it to occur which has zero evidence supporting it. Do you know how many people would have to be in the know about an operation like this for there to not be a single whistleblower providing substantial evidence? Yet the current President cannot even keep his extra-marital affairs secret? </p>

<p>It sounds like you&#39;ve read a decent amount of the conspiracy material, which is good, but I think you should also look into some of the &quot;debunking&quot; material because there is valuable information in there. Not that it will change your mind, but it will certainly make your future arguments stronger. </p>
