        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My wife and I deleted FB four years ago and let me just tell those that’ll listen, our relationship has made great leaps and bounds. FB is destroying marriages and relationships and not to mention creating a society full of Narcissistic Individuals. Don’t just roll over and listen to some of these Fake News Accounts overly convincing you that this “information “ you provided to FB is okay for them to do what they want with. Wake up and see the lights friends. </p>

<p>Ask anyone else that’s deleted FB  if they miss or regret getting rid of it and you’re gonna get the same answer I just gave. I’m happier, more confident, stable and more focused on what’s important to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk let’s start with narcissism on one side of a marriage or the trust issues. I just feel like people, and I was one of them for a while, get too caught up in trying to prove themselves to the world and end up neglecting the ones who are the most important. Hey I’ll be the first to say, it goes both ways. I’ve seen people constructively use FB for Charities, networking, getting a business launched but unfortunately temptations and people together always screw things up. I’m not the first person to mention any of this. What’s your side?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok with the rhetorical question. Lol. I feel like this about most every social networking site. When my wife and I signed off with FB, we left all social networking sites. I only just started using reddit several months ago and my main reason is the ability to remain anonymous if one wants too. If you’ve never had any issues or don’t see any problems then I’m happy for you. My sole intention is to let people know they’ll be ok without these platforms. Tell ya what, I’ll do some more research on you beliefs and you be open minded and do some research on mine. Proof is in the numbers. I assure you I’m not the minority with my thoughts and beliefs. </p>

I was solely referring to Facebook as that&#39;s what your original post was talking about, in reference to the relevance  of the whole Zuckerberg thing going on.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeh I hear ya man. Next time I’ll try to have some crayons on me so I can draw you a picture bc you’re so confused. My replies are pretty straightforward and easily understood, for most anyways. You came into this looking for an argument which is a very weak character trait. I was only planting a seed and you asked me a question so I tried to give you a reference bc you’ve been lost since jump. Once again, it’s just my opinion on an open forum. Not trying to change the world I assure you. Thanks for my daily dose of entertainment. Oh and relax a bit, this is really so petty</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really that aggravated or anything. All the claims you&#39;ve made were related around social media entirely, when my original comment was about Facebook, as that was what your post was about. You expanding it to all social media isn&#39;t confusing, it just changes the argument, as you now have to look at it&#39;s effects on a broader spectrum. All of the claims you made about social media are to a certain extent true in some parts. You originally said that after leaving Facebook, you and your wife began developing a more advanced relationship. That doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense, unless you were both being weird and secretive about your conducts on it. You claimed narcissism, which yes, I do agree with, however i fail to see how providing a few examples of its negatives means it should be gotten rid of, just like if I were to provide positives and say all social media such be unquestionably adored and praised. Its with its flaws, yes, but I fail to see how that is due to the site/app and not the person using it. All social media does in my opinion is allow a person to accentuate certain parts of their personality, be it for better or worse. Sorry you feel the need to be aggressive.</p>

Anyways, in one of my reply’s to you I even stated “that people and temptation are not a good mix.”  I do this same shit with texting. Maybe my brain isn’t wired to have a normal conversation thru texts. Story of my life. I totally agree with you and I was a lil too broad. My wife and I had no indiscretions and I assure you, other than me being a bit strange here and I hope you better understand now, my wife and I are amazing loving people. It just seemed like every time I turned around I was being bombarded by even friends of my wife and she was just tired of family drama. It’s case by case; I agree but when I mentioned “numbers,” I meant all the negative publicity and also all the first hand accounts I hear daily. My sister in law and her husband and many more I know are miserable and inferior bc of FB. Doctors are coming out of the woodwork everyday with studies against FB and what it does to people. I hear so many talk of how addicted they are and my sincere intentions were to reach out to these groups and let them know that there’s so much more to life than worrying about how they look or come across to others and then not to mention the jealousy it creates. I just feel like good people open theirselves up to situations, sometimes, bc of outside influences, so why take the risk? Sometimes the heat of the moment is too strong for certain people and they then find their self far enough in and they lose everything that’s important. Guess I let my emotions get the best of me. Thanks for putting me in check in a much nicer way that I did you. You handled yourself very well and I will learn from this. Wish me luck on the 5th. Two amazing young ladies that I can control if and when they use social networking. Haha! I feel sorry for them. I hope I was able to salvage something from this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeh I hear ya man. Next time I’ll try to have some crayons on me so I can draw you a picture bc you’re so confused. My replies are pretty straightforward and easily understood, for most anyways. You came into this looking for an argument which is a very weak character trait. I was only planting a seed and you asked me a question so I tried to give you a reference bc you’ve been lost since jump. Once again, it’s just my opinion on an open forum. Not trying to change the world I assure you. Thanks for my daily dose of entertainment. Oh and relax a bit, this is really so petty</p>
