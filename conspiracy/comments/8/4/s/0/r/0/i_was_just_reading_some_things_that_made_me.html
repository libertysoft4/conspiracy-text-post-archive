I found it disturbing.</p>

<p>EDIT: I forgot the whole reason I&#39;m posting to this sub, why do you think this is happening? The normalizing. I&#39;ve noticed it for a while but I don&#39;t know why it is happening or who would gain from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one proved your half-ass bullshit point, and legally, yes, some states consider what you did pedophilia.  Do I have to spell it out to you or does your dumb-ass-backwoods-redneck even remotely understand what pedophilia is?   Child beauty pageants aren’t pedophilia.  Again, you need to do your research and stop watching tv shows that sensationalize the glamour pageants-which are different than most child pageants.   Maybe if you got off reddit long enough to learn something you would understand the difference AND know how to make a valid point.<br/>
And for fucks sake-learn how to write a semi-literate paragraph with appropriate capitalization and punctuation.<br/>
Actually, you know what?  You can’t form a decent cohesive sentence so why on earth am I wasting my time asking you to form an EDUCATED opinion?</p>

Also if polygamy is one day legalized, it’s pretty much Game over for that society, it’s historically been proven you deny young men access to women they become highly violent and destructive. A CEO has 12 wives that’s 11 men-half a small classroom-  without hope of any type of marriage unless it’s gay. Instead of going gay, they become extremely agitated and restless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why just lately? Have you ever studied?</p>

<p>Literally, pedophilia is as old as recorded history. From ancient Greece, the Old Testament, Mohammad&#39;s wife, save trade across all continents, even in ancient cultures like Aboriginal Australians where young girls were married to elders.</p>

<p>To understand the now, look at the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I know, it has always been a thing. I just meant that lately is when I noticed people defending it so much, I&#39;m sure part of that is my being oblivious, and part of it is the anonymity of the internet. just in my experience it seems that there is a recent push to make it look okay, but I could absolutely be wrong.</p>

Once you understand a lot of times pedophiles fuck their own children, it makes that stuff seem more sinister.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is strange that my post about pedophilia made you so angry, I wonder why? teenagers have sex with each other, you go ahead and tell yourself that that somehow makes me a pervert. you&#39;re right about my writing skills, I&#39;ve actually done a lot with my life and some of those things caused a few traumatic brain injuries that cause me to forget things sometimes. It&#39;s funny, I&#39;m sure you wrote that from your mom&#39;s basement. I can&#39;t tell you why you&#39;re talking to me, I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t. Like I said it&#39;s very telling that you are so upset over this subject.</p>
