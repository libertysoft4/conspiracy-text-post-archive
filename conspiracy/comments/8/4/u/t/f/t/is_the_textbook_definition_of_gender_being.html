        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SUBMISSION STATEMENT:</p>

<p>I was watching a debate TV last night where the pundits were (of course) talking past each other on this issue. And they seemed to essentially be disagreeing on what the definition of &quot;gender&quot; is. So I decided to look it up using MacOS Dictionary. And I got a very &quot;modern&quot; definition, with quotes and examples from current events.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/sC86afJ.png">https://i.imgur.com/sC86afJ.png</a></p>

<p>This got me thinking…because I remember a more &quot;binary&quot; definition of the term from my years in high school and college, so I went to some other dictionary sites, and immediately discovered that the &quot;binary&quot; definition. Which is still the first and most common definition here, on Dictonary.com:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/CcdAVlx.png">https://i.imgur.com/CcdAVlx.png</a></p>

<p>The other dictionary sites are in various stages of this change:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/mWfDdzE.png">https://i.imgur.com/mWfDdzE.png</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/biGeXqI.png">https://i.imgur.com/biGeXqI.png</a></p>

<p>There are other online sites, too, which all lead with the &quot;binary&quot; definition. I threw out my paper dictionary years ago (probably a mistake), so I&#39;m wondering: <em>is this term is being &quot;nudged&quot; in a certain direction to fit a political/social agenda?</em></p>

<p>Here you can see the day-to-day change in the Oxford English dictionary:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/vhQBYx7.png">https://i.imgur.com/vhQBYx7.png</a></p>

<p>Or is it changing/morphing to reflect the national political discussion? If so…is that okay? A case could easily be made that definitions of terms change over time. But for terms like <em>this,</em> that loom so large in political discourse, it seems rather dangerous: <strong>he who owns the dictionary can change the culture.</strong></p>

<p>NOTE: I DO NOT PERSONALLY CARE ABOUT THE WAY YOU WANT TO LIVE YOUR LIFE! I am merely wondering if there is an official (or even organic) effort to make this definitional change. This is not meant to be a judgmental post, and I&#39;m not at all personally opposed to the concept of a &quot;fluid&quot; sexual orientation, or even a biological man living life as a &quot;woman,&quot; vice-versa, etc.</p>

<p>Can we all check our older, paper dictionaries?</p>

<p>Gender is defined here in the 1800s as</p>

<p>A kind, a sort, a sex, in grammar, a distinction of nouns in regard to sex.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know what your point is it if this is relevant but remember the meaning of words is always changing (think &quot;bundle of sticks&quot; faggot, &quot;happy and joyous&quot; gay etc)</p>

<p>Language isn&#39;t ever static, words and definitions are in a constant flux. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not imaginary ;)</p>

<p>But again, while I don&#39;t have a problem with the concept of the updated definition…but the act of nudging official definitions of words/terms to advance a social/political agenda is worth a) identifying, and b) discussing. While maybe not a conspiracy-conspiracy, it&#39;s certainly a concerted effort to manipulate. For right or wrong.</p>

<p>Imagine if they were trying to change, say, the official definition of &quot;terrorism&quot; to mean &quot;violence in the name of Islam.&quot; Because, after all, a heck of a lot of terrorist acts lately are perpetrated by Muslims. A lot of people would be like &quot;Hey! WTF!&quot; and they&#39;d be right. (I know it&#39;s a stretch, but hopefully you get my point).</p>

<p>PS, as I stated above I&#39;m not opposed to the concept of gender being a social rather than biological construct. But the definition <em>has</em> changed in recent years.</p>

<p>Terrorism was only the replacement fear word for, Godlesws Commie Athiest Socialist beasts. Strictly for economic an political dominance and protection of private wealth via national power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who sporadically writes an opinion piece in Dutch media, I recently got confronted with how much language and meanings are ever changing. I sent a letter to one of our papers asking for why they chose a certain construction of a sentence, and got an answer from a historian that gave me a little lesson on our language. I learned among other things that our word for woman used to mean Lady, whereas our word for bitch used to mean woman. This is just a small example but changes to meanings of words happen so often. </p>

<p>Now for this specific case, I personally don&#39;t see the problem with the change to the meaning of the word gender, as long as the meaning of the word sex stays the same. Those that don&#39;t believe, or refuse to use these meanings of gender, can in that case simply use the word sex without any scrutiny.</p>

There really is a difference between sex and gender, being that one of them is a biological and or categorical concept used to differentiate based on physical and visible traits, whereas gender is a social construct and thus can change based on the state of society&#39;s view of the concept. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I see now what has happened.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term gender is relatively new.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is old enough. It came from the Old French to Middle English. Middle English flourished 1150 to 1470 AD.
Back then, gender meant something like sort.
It entered common usage as a term distinguishing males from females.
From there, in the early 20th century it became a linguistic term. There were 3 genders, Male, Female and Neuter, (der, die, das).
During the 20th century the term gender continued to mean male or female, (and in linguistics neuter).
During the 21st century the explosion of sexuality identifiers has led to the word gender being given far more varieties to choose from.
Most of the rainbow alphabet that I can think of are still variations and combinations of the basic 3 genders.
There are Men who are sexually attracted to men.
Women who are sexually attracted to women
Men who dress like women.
Women who dress like men
Men who identify as women.
Women who identify as men.
Men who have been biologically modified to become women.
Men who have removed their genitals or otherwise chosen to become neuter.
Etc etc and on it goes in varieties too many to list here and undoubtedly some I am not even aware of yet, but essentially, they are all variations and combinations of the 3 basic genders, M, F, &amp; N.
Gender refers to whether someone is of the male sex or the female sex or neuter sex.
The fact that so many more variations and combinations of gender have clamoured for recognition as separate genders in themselves instead of being content to invent their own identifiers has led to the word gender having been co-opted in service to their quest for separate social recognition.
Time will tell whether gender will be completely changed to incorporate all the <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-genders-are-there-in-2018">112 different genders</a> there are so far in 2018, but there is a strong progressive push towards it and it looks like being bulldozed through.
How useful it will be remains to be seen.
Do we need a separate gender for each subtle variety of self-identification?
Here&#39;s a few of the first (alphabetically) genders:
*Abimegender: a gender that is profound, deep, and infinite; meant to resemble when one mirror is reflecting into another mirror creating an infinite paradox
*Adamasgender: a gender which refuses to be categorized
*Aerogender: a gender that is influenced by your surroundings
*Aesthetigender: a gender that is derived from an aesthetic; also known as videgender
*Affectugender: a gender that is affected by mood swings
*Agenderflux: being mostly agender except having small shifts towards other genders making them demigenders (because of the constancy of being agender)
*Alexigender: a gender that is fluid between more than one gender but the individual cannot tell what those genders are
*Aliusgender: a gender which is removed from common gender descriptors and guidelines
*Amaregender: a gender that changes depending on who you’re in love with
*Ambigender: defined as having the feeling of two genders simultaneously without fluctuation; meant to reflect the concept of being ambidextrous, only with gender</p>

<p>I would have to say irrefutably yes to OP&#39;s question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize what sub this is, right?</p>

<p>The point of the post is clearly outlined in the submission statement. And personally I don&#39;t really care <em>how many genders there are</em> as I clearly stated above. I can&#39;t really do much more to make that clear, but if you don&#39;t <em>read</em> things then you will never &quot;get it.&quot;</p>

<p>Or having transgender demon monsters reading books to kids. What&#39;s next? your a bigot if you don&#39;t accept pedophiles? (not far from it, look how they sexualized the little boy in the video I posted, sick!) The hate is probably for shit like this that is reckless and irresponsible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are &quot;more than two genders&quot; being pushed on you?  I personally think there are two genders.  But I don&#39;t get triggered by the idea of someone else having a different opinion on that. </p>

<p>If someone wants to believe in more than two genders, or that a magical being who could turn water into wine was born from a virgin, or any number of other crazy fantasies, what does it have to do with me?  Or mine?  </p>

<p>I will raise my kids as I see fit, and other parents can do the same.  The video you linked is just as disgusting to me as the video I saw yesterday of some redneck hick dumbshit mother spouting off anti-muslim shit to her kids</p>

<p>Unfortunately laws in many Western countries are also changing to reflect this new fantastical belief system. </p>

<p>These people aren&#39;t just standing on the street screaming at white people, they are growing their blue hair out and subverting the system from within. </p>

<p>I just found out that the concept of &quot;White Privilege&quot; is now taught to kids in elementary schools where I live.</p>
