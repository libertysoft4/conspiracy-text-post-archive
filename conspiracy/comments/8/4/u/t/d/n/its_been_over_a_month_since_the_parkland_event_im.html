<p>Now that a month has passed, there must be <em>plenty</em> of evidence that real shots were fired. So for all the people who love to assert that this was a <em>false flag,</em> but definitely not a shooting <em>hoax,</em> please make the best argument that a real shooting happened featuring real bullets and real victims.</p>

<p>This should go without saying, but &quot;I know someone&quot; is not proof to anyone but the person saying it, unless you are going to back it up somehow. You can offer this as proof if you want me to laughingly dismiss your unbacked internet claim. </p>

<p>We are looking for the <em>three-dimensional appearance</em> of a real shooting.  Evidence goes below:</p>

<p>On to your question, I&#39;m not of the opinion that mass shootings are faked. Through cursory research of prior shootings, there has never been evidence that I have found to support that idea. I don&#39;t have the motivation to go combing through every shooting to see whether or not it was faked, for various reasons. Also, outside of clear video evidence, there is nothing that could be found on the internet that would sway me to believe this, or any, shooting was faked. At the end of the day, if the video of the shooting was to be posted online, those are children being killed, and I can understand why people wouldn&#39;t want that to be on the internet for all to see.</p>

<p>Is there clear video evidence that any shooting is real? I’d love to see it if you have it.</p>

<p>If there <em>isn’t</em> then you should consider why your standard of proof for a faked shooting is so much higher than for accepting a “real” one.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered what is the point of the news? How important are the stories to your daily life? How does it enrich you?</p>

<p>News has a very clear purpose, which is obvious when honestly examined. If a story isn’t outright entertainment then it’s agenda-pushing propaganda.</p>

<p>Vegas: no. It was a made for TV hoax, I have seen no clear evidence any live rounds were fired, let alone anyone or anything being hit by them. It’s one of the more recent in a long line of similar events that rely primarily on media fakery and the audience’s suspension of disbelief.</p>

<p>JFK: I believed he was killed until quite recently, just not the way the media portrayed it. <a href="/u/daddie_o">/u/daddie_o</a> put me onto a couple of fascinating long form articles and related links that made me re-evaluate that belief, check his recent comment history to find them.</p>

<p>I now lean towards the idea that JFK’s assassination was faked too.</p>

<p>The Zapruder film is the <em>least</em> convincing piece of evidence for the official story.</p>

<p>If you look into its own history, when it was released to the public, and all the problems it has then you will soon understand why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have seen dead people...she&#39;s dead</p>

<p>So have I, and no she isn’t.</p>

<p>In fact, I’m not even sure “she” is an actual person. Training mannequins are quite lifelike now, as are Hollywood moulage effects. Look into the US Army specialist division for setting up scenes just like this.</p>

<p>There happened to be US Army trucks parked right outside the event too. Curious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you have lost any credibility I would have given you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not about me.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s time to reconsider if perceived credibility can even help to discern truth.</p>

<p>I came to the realisation that credibility is an incredibly dangerous concept. It creates a false sense of security by minimizing your desire to double check a claim.</p>

<p>Once you start peeling back <em>that</em> onion, you come to realise most of the “fundamental truths” you take for granted every day, things you and everyone else are taught in school, are all grounded on trust in authority, faith and other such fuzzy feelings.</p>

<p>The people in charge would be grateful if you continue to believe things based on credibility.</p>

<p>Evidence and claims <strong>always</strong> stand on their own merit until disproven, regardless of the “credibility” of the person (re)stating them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are at an impasse. You genuinely believe everything is a conspiracy. Hypothetical for you, if I attended the concert that was shot up in las vegas, and I told you it was real based off what I witnessed, would you have a retort to how what I saw was an elaborate mock up, but ultimately fake? I feel like that is the direction you are going.</p>

<p>None of the evidence you have on any of these conspiracies hold any weight. People connect dots that are not there. You don&#39;t take into consideration that people make mistakes. That people say the wrong shit. I assume this bridge that fell in Florida is a fake cover up for something else? The official narrative is almost always going to be riddled with mistakes, and even lies, but that doesn&#39;t mean it is a part of a much bigger overarching conspiracy.  </p>

<p>I mean there are no &quot;US Army specialist division&quot; that set up scenes. That doesn&#39;t exist. Where is the evidence of that? Also, what US Army truck was parked outside of the concert? Why would they use actual Army vehicles that could easily be identified as such? Why have a branch of the Army that sets up scenes, when you could have a branch of special ops, or a completely different part of the government that has nothing to do with the Army? That has no markings. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know &quot;why&quot;. To speculate on a motive is a waste of energy. In any case, the &quot;what&quot; is more important when it comes to evidence. What is it, what does it show, what does it prove?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had no trouble ruling out all explanations put forward to date (except for &quot;it was a hoax&quot;) simply by judging the evidence objectively and ignoring what the media tells me to think about it.</p>

<p>In the absence of <em>any</em> compelling evidence to support the original claims of a mass shooting, numerous gunshot wounds and 58 deaths, then those claims are false.</p>

<p>The question was a thought experiment to prove a point. And it was meant to be a person to person meeting.

<p>The evidence in a jfk post saying he wasn&#39;t killed. It was daddie_o&#39;s post, but you pointed me to it.</p>

<p>Those people are make up artists not army personnel. And I have actually trained with these scenarios, and talked to people that did the makeup. It&#39;s a waste of money if you ask me, but malicious makeup artists faking a shooting? You are stretching it.</p>

<p>Things I can personally verify with an unbroken chain of evidence leading to a primary source, or from sources I have personally vetted.</p>

<p>Consensus, popularity, capability, credibility... all meaningless in terms of truth. Unpick those terms to their roots to understand what I mean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a point. Epistemology is a tricky subject, and it becomes so nebulously philosophical after a certain point it becomes rather silly.</p>

<p><em>Reductio ad absurdum</em> - one of the classic logical fallacies, incidentally. </p>

<p>A reductive epistemological framework isn’t necessary for things like the food I’m eating because I can already make sense of it, or in the case of the actual temperature or what’s actually going into my car’s gas tank, it doesn’t matter if I can’t.</p>

<p>I do prefer knowing what I’m eating; I avoid processed food and when I eat out it’s in restaurants where I can see the kitchen staff working.</p>

<p>My culinary preferences won’t get to the heart of what you’re asking for, though, and that is for me to satisfactorily fill the gaps left behind if one rejects the official narrative.</p>

<p><strong>I don’t have all the answers</strong>. Accepting that is part of the learning curve. Rejecting the false without demanding the true. It’s hard, because we humans do love a good story to fill awkward gaps in the narrative.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean I can’t identify bullshit when I see it though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you trust your research as apposed to those who were actually at the event that took place?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is, the people representing these events on TV are obviously stage managed and cannot be trusted. Just “being there” isn’t nearly enough to qualify their accounts.</p>

<p>After hundreds of hours (no exaggeration) of researching characters and claims from these events over the years, I’ve yet to find even one example whose trail doesn’t abruptly and suspiciously end.</p>

<p>Media fakery is the only rational explanation tying it all together. The events are scripted, they have a limited cast, the people on screen are also (mostly) acting, the ‘physical evidence’ is just props.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All wars are faked, but that is not the same as saying &quot;nothing happens&quot;. Clearly there needs to be enough of a show to have the appearance of real conflict. Explosions, destruction, some inevitable deaths and injuries along the way.</p>

<p>But nothing like the chaos and ruin we are fed by the media.</p>

<p>Events resembling the common definition of &quot;war&quot; are not nations fighting one another. It&#39;s all planned, outcomes are known in advance and the media narrates the storyline, wittingly or unwittingly, until the ending.</p>

<p>This goes back much further than Iraq and Afghanistan too. The extent of the deception we all live under is almost unfathomable.</p>

<p>As Marshall McLuhan is quoted as saying, &quot;“Only the small secrets need to be protected. The big ones are kept secret by public incredulity.” </p>

<p>As for anyone reading this far and incredulously mocking the assertion that Hitler was gay and Jewish: well, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/07/books.booksnews">mainstream historians</a> have <a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/the-peculiar-sex-life-of-adolf-hitler-offers-insight-into-the-dictators-gay-partners-391500.html">shown convincingly</a> that he was indeed gay.  </p>

<p>There has also been a partial admission from the mainstream that Hitler had some Jewish roots, but <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/hiller.pdf">this paper here</a> offers a lot more evidence.</p>

<p>All that may be somewhat beside the point, since <a href="https://pieceofmindful.com/2017/01/27/whos-that-hitler/#comment-50296">it appears that more than one person played the &#39;role&#39; of Hitler</a> over the years, so it&#39;s anybody&#39;s guess who the &quot;real&quot; Hitler was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lack of evidence is what makes people that say &quot;this is a false flag but can&#39;t be a hoax&quot; very sketchy.  You basically have to take someone like David Hogg&#39;s word for it.  Considering he is pushing an over the top controlled agenda that would be a very naive thing to do.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure you have seen this video of JFK getting shot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Zapruder film is the <em>least</em> convincing piece of evidence for the official story.</p>

<p>If you look into its own history, when it was released to the public, and all the problems it has then you will soon understand why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have seen dead people...she&#39;s dead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So have I, and no she isn’t.</p>

<p>In fact, I’m not even sure “she” is an actual person. Training mannequins are quite lifelike now, as are Hollywood moulage effects. Look into the US Army specialist division for setting up scenes just like this.</p>

<p>There happened to be US Army trucks parked right outside the event too. Curious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you have lost any credibility I would have given you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not about me.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s time to reconsider if perceived credibility can even help to discern truth.</p>

<p>I came to the realisation that credibility is an incredibly dangerous concept. It creates a false sense of security by minimizing your desire to double check a claim.</p>

<p>Once you start peeling back <em>that</em> onion, you come to realise most of the “fundamental truths” you take for granted every day, things you and everyone else are taught in school, are all grounded on trust in authority, faith and other such fuzzy feelings.</p>

<p>The people in charge would be grateful if you continue to believe things based on credibility.</p>

<p>Evidence and claims <strong>always</strong> stand on their own merit until disproven, regardless of the “credibility” of the person (re)stating them.</p>
