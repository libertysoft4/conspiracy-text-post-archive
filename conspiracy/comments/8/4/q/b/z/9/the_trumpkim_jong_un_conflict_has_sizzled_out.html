Kim was a puppet of TPTB but finally realized Trump is not one of them so he is going to flip sides. NK was never a target it was a vault. A war with Russia is necessary for their end game of ruling the world, Putin will not fold. Thankfully Trump came along and thew a cog in the wheel and slow them down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of these countries have been around longer than we were told. Iran and Iraq the old Babylon. The fallen empires transferred from one to the next on a cultural level. Babylonian, Egyptian, Persian, Greek transitioning to the still ruling Roman Empire. The architecture around Washington Disctric of the Goddess Columbia a lot of Roman and Greek influences(in the architecture). You see it in the government systems and the titles we bestow on our politicians. What shape you ask, in the ideology that&#39;s being pushed the political systems(the many being ruled by the few). The ruling class and the slaves have never really changed. You keep the people fighting and do what you will behind the scenes. Still to this day the Muslims against the Christians, East versus West. The crusades all over again.</p>

<p><a href="http://goodizen.com/blaming-russia-over-spy-poisoning-is-a-part-of-the-conspiracy-to-attack-iran-militarily/">Follow up to our conspiracy theory that poisoning of the spy and his daughter is just a prelude of war on Iran plotted by Israel in conjuction with their “colonial” superpower U.S.A -</a></p>

<p><strong>Russia spy attack probe is ‘chilling reminder’ of Iraq War build-up, a ‘Deja Vu’ of Iraq War Run-up</strong></p>

<p>“It’s absolutely absurd that Russia would actually put its signature on a crime like this if they had carried it out” says George Galloway.</p>

<p><strong>‘Absurd’ that Russia would leave its ‘signature’ on Skripal crime – George Galloway</strong></p>

<p>‘One of the Great Hoaxes’: Skripal Poisoning Evokes ‘Deja Vu’ of Iraq War Run-up, similar to its headlong rush to war with Iraq in 2003.</p>

<p>So, does the poisoning mark the beginning of war against Iran? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/84rrgb/galloway_russia_gains_nothing_from_spy_poisoning/">More Here</a></p>
