<p>... CIA director Mike Pompeo, an Iran hawk who once said that the United States and allied military might handily destroy Iran’s nuclear capability. Naming Pompeo is a signal that Trump could soon abandon the Iran nuclear deal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pompeo as a congressman once said that a military <em>[against Iran]</em> strike was doable.</p>

<p>“In an unclassified setting, <strong>it is under 2,000 sorties to destroy the Iranian nuclear capacity,”</strong> the Kansas Republican said in 2014. “This is not an insurmountable task for the coalition forces.”</p>

<p><strong>Pompeo was also close to Israel when he was in Congress and had praised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a fierce opponent of the Iran deal.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pompeo has warned that the Iran nuclear deal was failing, and has <strong>compared Iran to ISIS</strong>. While serving in Congress, Pompeo was among the most outspoken Republican critics of President Barack Obama&#39;s foreign policy in the Middle East. <em>Tillerson, meanwhile, was one of the most prominent members of Trump&#39;s administration who called not to withdraw from the deal, but instead to remain committed to it and make sure it is rigorously enforced</em></p>

<p>US President Donald Trump unceremoniously fired his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, on Tuesday morning, <strong><em>in part over &quot;disagreements&quot; on the Iran nuclear deal</em></strong> and amid a critical negotiation with Europe over its fate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tillerson has publicly contradicted Trump on the Iran deal in the past [...]  also advised Trump not to rip up the nuclear accord outright. But his named replacement, CIA director <em>Mike Pompeo, has disagreed, advocating for a full US withdrawal from the 2015 pact negotiated by former President Barack Obama, Iran and five other powers.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Israeli officials tell The Jerusalem Post that they believe Trump is serious in his threat to withdraw from the deal</strong>. The US-E3 talks dominated Trump&#39;s conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House last week.</p>

<p>“We disagreed on things,” Trump said of Tillerson just after announcing the firing on Twitter. He mentioned differences over how to handle the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump wants to withdraw if it is not changed to his satisfaction. <strong><em>“When you look at the Iran deal, I think it’s terrible,” Trump said, whereas Tillerson thought “it was okay. I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently. So we were not really thinking the same.”</em></strong></p>

<p>The &quot;dogs&quot; can be leashed, it <em>can</em> be done.</p>

<p>The only problem is that it won&#39;t be done unless and until the American people recognize who the <em>&quot;leaders of the dog pack&quot;</em> are, and deal with their treachery accordingly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, calling out the &quot;dogs&quot; is taboo in according to the twisted, politically correct mindset that has overtaken the US and all of Western civilization.</p>

<p>In other words, you&#39;re right. We&#39;re fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that Russia is a paragon of virtue in the world, but they are however the leader of the anti-imperialist movement, along with countries like Iran, China, North Korea, Syria and others. Countries who used to be a part of that are Iraq and Libya, though they now have been neutralized to a certain extent. </p>

<p>Any country does enough shit to be painted as a villain. However, the MSM is targeting Russia and Muslims for a specific reason and that is, in my opinion, because the US/Israel/NATO coalition is now supporting Syrian insurrection with goals of controlling or destabilising Syria and then possibly Lebanon and Sudan. After that they can go after Iran, which is the only major enemy Israel has in it&#39;s neighborhood, the Sunni countries showing through their action that they support the imperialist agenda, even while they say the opposite and even if the Sunni population does not. </p>

<p>All these countries are supported by Russia/China and other anti-imperialists.</p>

<p>All the things you accuse Russia of, the US is more than guily of. Except for jailing opposition but that’s because there is no opposition, both parties serve corporate interests and both parties serve Israeli interests. In Russia you have actual division, pro-western and pro-independence/Eurasian.</p>

<p>Finally, I don&#39;t believe the nerve gas attack was Russian but the important point is we don&#39;t have the facts yet in 24h we already have a culprit and the effects are being felt, with no confirmation of culpability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and it depends on ones definition of &quot;anytime soon&quot; as far as that goes. I just get a little worried anytime this kind of stuff involving Iran is mentioned especially in regards to israels influence on the united states. Im no theologian but the regions described in that prophecy would be modern day Iran, Syria, parts or all of turkey and others in the region. Combine this with their allies in Russia and china and you don&#39;t have to use your imagination too much to start coming up with reasonable situations regarding world war 3. The reason I always think of that chapter is it freaks me out how accurate it potentially is and WHAT it&#39;s describing and Im a christian!</p>

If you go to the table of nations in genesis and do a bit of digging online you can probably get a pretty good idea of where the area is and what their modern counterparts would be. There are opposing views on this just like pretty much everything else as to be expected. Im sorry I can&#39;t respond more at this time but hopefully this was some help. I am somewhat familiar with your families holy book but I wouldn&#39;t know what particular places to even start looking in that let alone anything specific.

    <div class="md"><p>There is a foreign power exerting far too much influence on US foreign policy and meddling in US domestic affairs.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t the country the US Corporate media is shitting itself over.</p>

<p>What does that say about the US corporate media?</p>

<p>How will the USA use &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot; as an excuse to bomb Iran when the US and Israel support Al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria? </p>

<p>Shia...t, that&#39;s easy, all they have to do is chant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wxp-NxJny8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=81">&quot;<strong><em>it&#39;s an entirely different kind of Islam, altogether!</em></strong>&quot;</a></p>

<p>Nevermind that the 9-11 attackers and other terrorists attacking Western targets have been Sunni Muslims.</p>

<p>And of course they&#39;ll deny that the US and Israel created ISIS supported al Qaeda/ al Nusra... and call anyone who says otherwise bad names.</p>

<p>The usual.</p>

<p>The usual way. The teevee will start beating the war drums and we will invent some flimsy excuse for fighting another of Israel&#39;s wars for them. </p>

<h1>Who&#39;s Next?</h1>

<p>Below are 9 embattled Trump Cabinet members likely to be given the boot this week, as the White House appears to be having a firing spree this week: -</p>

<p><strong>9 People Donald Trump Might Fire Next</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Jeff Sessions</strong>: Trump has publicly attack the attorney general repeatedly -- calling him, among other things, &quot;beleaguered&quot; and &quot;DISGRACEFUL.&quot; He has told not one but two news organizations that he would not have appointed Sessions as AG if he knew Sessions would recuse himself in the Russia investigation. He refers to Sessions as &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot; in private settings, according to the Washington Post. I mean....</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jeff Sessions</strong>: See #1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>David Shulkin</strong>: Not only did VA Secertary Shulkin misuse taxpayer money on a trip to Europe last year, he is also weathering a scathing report from the inspector general regarding a veterans center in DC that has been plagued by poor management. Even worse? He got the dreaded vote of confidence from the White House earlier this week; White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Shulkin was doing a &quot;great job.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>H.R. McMaster</strong>: Rumors of tension between the National Security Adviser and Trump have been rampant for months. There&#39;s even been chatter about how to move McMaster back into the military in order to get him out of the White House. With Trump jettisoning Tillerson, might he move on another member of the more globally-minded wing of his foreign policy team?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ryan Zinke</strong>: The Interior secretary was on the receiving end of a slew of negative press last week when word leaked out that the department had paid $139,000 to replace doors in his office space. Zinke pled ignorance and said he knew nothing of the expenditure, with his spokesperson pointing to a decision by career employees. Zinke is also facing a series of questions about whether his travel expenditures push the limits of legality. He was one of four Trump Cabinet officials -- Shulkin, HUD Secretary Ben Carson and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt were the others -- called to the White House in February for frank conversations about ethics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scott Pruitt</strong>: The EPA administrator made news -- and not the good kind -- earlier this year when it was revealed he regularly flew first class and stayed in high end hotels, racking up expenses in excess of past people to hold his job. Pruitt said he flew 1st class because of the threats made against him. He has also faced scrutiny of late for allowing an EPA employee to pursue outside work as a media consultant. Not for nothing: Pruitt called Trump an &quot;empty vessel&quot; in 2016.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ben Carson</strong>: The Housing and Urban Development secretary purchased -- and then canceled -- a $31,000 dining set for his work office. Why isn&#39;t he higher on this list? Because Trump likes him -- and the two went through the political wars together in 2016. I think that counts for something -- maybe a lot -- in Trump&#39;s book.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>John Kelly</strong>: Reports are rampant that Kelly and Trump have fallen out, and that, as importantly, the White House chief of staff is in semi-open warfare with Javanka. Kelly&#39;s ham-handed handling of the Rob Porter debacle and the resultant news coverage clearly knocked him down several pegs in Trump&#39;s eyes. And, Kelly was reportedly part of a &quot;suicide pact&quot; with Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis -- that if one left or was fired, they would all leave. Working against the idea of Kelly being fired: Trump loves &quot;his&quot; generals.

<li><p><strong>Betsy DeVos</strong>: The Education secretary has had a very rocky road. This weekend was the bumpiest bit yet as DeVos seemed totally out of her depth in an interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot; Lesley Stahl. Trump hates negative headlines that he doesn&#39;t cause. But, it seems like he has more urgent firing priorities than DeVos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jim Mattis</strong>: The &quot;Mad Dog&quot; is only on this list because of the aforementioned &quot;suicide pact&quot; with Tillerson and Kelly. That aside, he appears to be the Cabinet secretary who has clashed the least -- or the least publicly -- with Trump.</p></li>
