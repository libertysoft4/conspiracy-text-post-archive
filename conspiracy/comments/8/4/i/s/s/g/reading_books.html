I&#39;d say it&#39;s something like a 50/50 - 60/40 split with people my age in regards to whether or not they read books. I don&#39;t know how it is with kids younger than me though, because I know that people my age were still being read books while we were little, whereas a 4 year old today is more likely to watch some videos on YouTube than be read a book. My generation (+/- a year) just about spans that gap of &quot;people who grew up without an Internet and were introduced to it&quot; vs &quot;people who grew up with the Internet always being a thing&quot;.<br/>
If I were to make a speculative guess, I&#39;d reckon that as a byproduct of growing up with the Internet, the younger generation don&#39;t have as much of a natural incentive to read actual books when all the information is readily available online. Whereas those who knew what it was like to regularly come home to a house without Internet and had to actually go to the library to read books to get information have that incentive. That physical act of going somewhere to seek out physical information leaves much more of a psychological impact than having information simply being fed to you via a screen. When you put in that effort, expend real energy and then finally get the information in the end your brain sends out the relevant neurotransmitters to complete that emotional reward system we have naturally wired into us. Internet information generally doesn&#39;t do that for.</p>
