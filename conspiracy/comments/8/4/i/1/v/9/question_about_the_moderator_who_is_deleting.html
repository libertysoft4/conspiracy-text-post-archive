<p>All highly active threads that didn’t need to be. Then subjectively telling people their opinion is wrong and killing all topics. This is more of a blanket thing.

<p>Looks like everything is working as intended for the most part.</p>

<p>I did see a few things removed by automod that I disagree with, but I have no idea what that bot uses for parameters and it&#39;s not that important to me personally. If it is to you, ask the mods. Or make a stink.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to put this out there, because I looked at the mod log: The mod you&#39;re talking about has removed about 70 comments in the last 11 hours and about 21 threads in the last 11 hours. To be fair, I didn&#39;t count those by hand, I just copy/pasted some text from the mod log in a subreddit I moderate and changed my username to his. But, I looked at the mod&#39;s profile and ctrl+F&#39;d &quot;Removed&quot; and got 91 results for the last 11 hours. Seems accurate enough to me. </p>

<p>The biggest thread (as in, with the most comments) that was removed in the last 12 hours had 66 comments. It was removed because it lacked a Submission Statement. After the poster added one, the mod re-approved it.</p>
