<p>Also calling them bogus predictions when he spent a lot of time researching is disrespectful and dismissive of the extensive work he puts in.. keyboard warriors like you who put others down for experimenting or trying something new are one of the biggest problem these days.

    <div class="md"><p>A prediction is bogus if it&#39;s wrong because it&#39;s based on flawed thinking or flawed data.  No matter how much hard work someone puts into a bogus theory, that&#39;s wasted work, and the theory remains bogus.</p>

<p>The specifics are my business, but, plenty.  I&#39;ve gotten a lot accomplished in my life, both in the realms of science and in politics, and I&#39;m still going.</p>

<p>My thought is that you wish <em>you</em> were doing more.  Almost always, when somebody something like you just did, it&#39;s because they are angry or disappointed with themself for that same reason.  In other words, you feel that you are a keyboard warrior who has contributed nothing to the world.</p>

<p>The wind&#39;s pressure is tiny.<br/>
But Earth&#39;s magnetic field is huge...  </p>

<p>Paging <a href="/r/theydidthemath">/r/theydidthemath</a> please?  </p>

<p>Remember, that whatever is driving said field lies deep within our planet.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they do. And, funnily enough, he consistently gives a large time frame for the quakes to fall within. Also, get this, the countries he typically chooses are all very earthquake prone. Nepal, Japan, and Italy have had 116 earthquakes in the past 365 days according to <a href="https://earthquaketrack.com/">this</a> website. That&#39;s 1 earthquake between those three countries every 3.14655 days. Obviously, odds are VERY high an earthquake happens in one of those countries within his 8 day guess (he frequently boasted about earthquakes that took place outside of his guessed timeframe as well). All he&#39;s &quot;hoping&quot; for is that the size of the earthquake is near his guess. Everything else he does is just playing good odds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, champ. My point is that it was silly that people were super duper impressed that a guy would list  3+ earthquake prone areas and predict that an earthquake would happen there within two weeks. It’s a simple numbers game. Like, next year I predict 6 hurricanes will happen during hurricane season in the Atlantic. Wanna know why? Cause that’s about the average a year. Wanna know why I picked that location? Cause that’s where they happen. Crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incorrect, he previous has come out and said his ability to predict where the earthquake will happen is the problem with his perditions. Magnitude has been consistent. His predictions are far from 100% accurate but every post of his I have followed were he has predicted a +7.0 magnitude quake has occurred but often not were he predicts. So I would just be prepared for the event regards where you are. Not overly useful prediction yet, but I do think he is on to something just does not have all of it worked out.</p>
