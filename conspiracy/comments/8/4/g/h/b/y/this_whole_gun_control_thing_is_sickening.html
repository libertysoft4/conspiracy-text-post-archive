Its sickening for me (as a young person) to think that all these young people are being led astray. To think that they have all been lead to believe that:</p>

<p>A) guns are the problem</p>

<p>B) &quot;stricter&quot; gun control will somehow solve shootings</p>

<p>The fact that we as a society are literally begging the <em>oh so trustworthy</em> government to take away our means to defend ourselves is utterly disgusting and mind-numbing to me. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Civil Wars happen when the victimized are armed. Genocides happen when they are not.&quot;</strong></p>

Yes, bad actors will still seek out a weapon and likely could still kill people. However it’s silly to believe that stricter gun control will in no way have any impact on gun violence or mass shootings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely they would. The US Military is the most powerful fighting force in history.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it would come at the massive cost of using that force on our own country. Innocent lives would be lost to drone strikes. After the initial beatings, it would turn into an insurgency (this happens in pretty much all modern rebellions). And the country would degrade into a war-torn mess.</p>

<p>A civil war would suck for everyone. I hate when people talk about it like they’re excited for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Sure but there is something else everyone is missing: criminals steal guns also.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody&#39;s missing that.</p>

<p>First, to be clear, only something like 10-15% of firearms used in crimes are stolen.  Weapons used in crimes are generally obtained through straw purchases, loans/gifts from others, or through a legal purchase.  (Much more the first two than the last.)</p>

<p>But that&#39;s besides the point.  Let&#39;s say 90% of guns used in crimes are stolen.  The simple fact is, the more guns are around in civilian hands, the more guns will be available for criminals to steal -- especially in the absence of laws or liability rules that create a legal duty to secure your weapons and make you liable for the consequences of failing to do so.</p>

<p>Virtually every single gun used in crime began its life on the legal market, and at some point was diverted into the black market (or, in a minority of cases, was fine and legal up until an on-paper &quot;good guy with a gun&quot; pulled the trigger).  That means choking the supply of legal weapons will unquestionably reduce the supply of illegal weapons, because all illegal weapons initially move through the legal markets. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like cocaine or meth, which have an entirely separate manufacturing and distribution system from pharmaceuticals; it&#39;s more like OxyContin or other opioids, which all begin with the legal market. And, similarly, the illegal opioid market is facilitated by pharmaceutical companies legally flooding the market with over-prescribed drugs -- and to reduce the number of opioid overdoses, you need regulation and oversight into how these drugs are prescribed, even to legal patients.</p>

<p>Yes, if you make it harder to make straw purchases, or buy guns yourself or get a loaner, you&#39;ll probably see some uptick in stolen weapons.  But it almost certainly wouldn&#39;t make up for the loss from the other channels, and over time you reduce the supply of weapons to steal.</p>

<p>I wish guns did not exist. But they do. </p>

<p>Do you think I&#39;m going to let some &quot;righteous&quot; political belief keep me from doing what is necessary to protect my 2 year old daughter?</p>

<p>These are the cards that were dealt. I have to play this game with the tools at my personal disposal. You can&#39;t deny that you need a gun to stay safe just because you fundamentally don&#39;t believe in them. </p>

<p>And you want to take them away so the enemy can be another step separated in power? They want us dependant on them for everything.. Food, clothing, shelter, water.... and protection.</p>

<p>A slippery slope, especially knowing they couldn&#39;t give a fuck less about you.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t depend on them for anything, it&#39;s just how I choose to live my life. </p>

<p>If there is anything in this world that I know not to trust, &quot;the government has the people&#39;s interest in mind&quot;</p>

<p>Because they don&#39;t, If I listed examples here it would be longer than the encyclopedia, It&#39;s one thing that we are pretty much sure about. </p>

<p>It&#39;s proven by every step they take. </p>

<p>Taking  guns, piece by piece, is all part of a bigger process with a longer timeline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I very much disagree.  I think that in the real world personal gun ownership has a negligible to nonexistent impact on your actual level of freedom; regardless, I think the gun control proposals that are actually on the table are so moderate they don&#39;t come even close to meaningfully impacting our Second Amendment rights.</p>

<p>I think in reality, gun grabber fear and hysteria is cultivated by a gun lobby that wants your money, and a GOP that relies on a handful of red-hot identity politics issues to distract from a policy of looting American on behalf of wealthy donors.</p>

<p>I think that there are hundreds, thousands of things that gundamentalists denigrate or ignore that do far more to protect your freedoms (both legal and practical) than firearms.  Things like ACLU lawsuits.  Labor organizing and unions.  Police civilian oversight committees.  SEC enforcement.  Socialized education and healthcare.  Subsidized childcare.  Government transparency and FOIA laws.  Anti-corruption norms and policies.  Anti-nepotism laws.  A progressive tax system designed to slow down accumulation of dynastic wealth.  Public defenders.  Bail reform.  Protestor protections -- fucking seriously on this one, the same politicians who froth at the mouth against the slightest gun regulation will turn around and pass a law to make it legal to run over protesters, or send the cops to surveil a mosque simply because they practice a different religion.  </p>

<p>Philando Castile had a gun.  Did that protect him? No.  You know what would&#39;ve? If the cop that shot him believed she&#39;d be subject to true civilian oversight and potential jail time for excessive force.  THAT&#39;S what protects really our freedom.  Not bullets, Bills, pleadings and protests.</p>

<p>I think some of the legislation that is used up there could be used in the States to effectively bring down the gun violence rate, as demonstrated by empirical figures. Seems like there are some pretty restrictive gun laws there, so how does that make you feel about the effects those have on a potential genocide in Canada?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I strongly dislike our gun laws. I feel they are very restrictive, and I would change it if I could. Indeed, though <strong>I do not oppose mental screenings</strong>, and I believe that is one of the things being discussed there. </p>

<p>The problem is that this isn&#39;t just about guns. Its not just about the hot button issue of the day. Today its your guns on the table, tomorrow it could be your free speech, as it is here. ( See bill C16.) It&#39;s about rights, and about freedom. And we seem to have less and less as time goes on.</p>

<p>I guess at the end of the day, I&#39;m here because I feel helpless. I see something that I disagree with, and I feel the need to do something. But instead of actually doing something, I&#39;m here. Because I&#39;m weak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of all the things you&#39;ve felt, did you ever feel afraid that you would be shot at school? And with restrictive gun laws and encroaching speech laws, wouldn&#39;t you argue that Canada is closer to a government genocidal takeover than the US? </p>

<p>I think a big problem that I see with this discussion is the polarization. I think we all can acknowledge that there should be, universally, some laws that restrict <em>certain types</em> of people from owning firearms, right? I mean, do you think that convicted felons of violence or domestic abuse should be able to purchase firearms? Should an 11 year old be able to buy a gun? I think those are both clear cut cases of how we need to have some gun control. The fact that the perpetrator of the Parkland shooting was known to police, FBI and their community as being a threat, repeatedly, and with all of this information, this individual was still able to legally purchase the weapon he used in that massacre. That&#39;s a gross failure all around, and a prime example of how gun reform should be considered.</p>

<p>Like you said, mental health screenings are a great step and I&#39;m all for that as well. All in all the polarization of this issue is a frustrating waste of time because neither side is accomplishing what they want. I don&#39;t believe we should be wasting time talking about banning bump stocks and AR-15s. I think anyone who is responsible enough to own those should be able to if they want. I own guns myself. </p>

<p>I am vehemently opposed to the lax gun laws down here. I live in one of the most lax gun areas in the States. I&#39;m not afraid of being shot intentionally; I&#39;m afraid of some dumb fuck, who thinks he&#39;s a cowboy because he bought a gun and carries it and never practices with it, is going to accidentally shoot me or someone I care about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;ve never felt afraid that I was going to be shot at school. I also believe I would feel safer if my teacher, or some other staff was armed. Mental screenings are good, age restrictions are good. Restrictions based on previous convictions or behaviour are also good. </p>

<p>Yes, I would say Canada is closer to a bad situation than the USA. The reason I speak now is because I believe Canada is too far gone. We would never be able to repeal our gun restrictions, and I believe it would be unlikely for the USA to repeal them as well, once passed.</p>

<p>It used to be that almost everyone knew how to use a gun, and use it responsibly. No longer is that the case. Here in Canada, you have to take a firearms safety course, and a PAL ( possession and acquisitions license) in order to obtain firearms, and a hunting license. I would not be opposed to programs such as that, which educate and train people in how to properly use and handle their firearms.</p>

People just rolled over because people said they had to and right there the government realized they had what they wanted....</p>

<p>Full compliance in the raping of their rights against illegal searches.
We as a nation have given up our rights and its all due to a perfect plan by our government to slowly roll out these events every so often.</p>

<p>I am not a right wing apologist nor a NRA member...I am simply an a American who is watching our way of life change before my eyes.. </p>

<p>From the implantation of the TSA raping kids and the elderly to board a plane to the police turning into SS agents it has become unbearable to simply drive down the street without fear of being killed. ...</p>

<p>It is fact the government is behind mist of not all the mass shootings with them going so far as setting up mentally ill people to commit crimes they never would have drempt of if not for FBI agents planning the entire crime.</p>

<p>The sad part in all of this is people actually believe these are organic crimes and believe there are actual threats from these fabricated crimes.</p>

<p>I was once proud to be an American...but now...I am embarrassed to call myself one.</p>

<p>1984 is here and we no longer have any freedom.
I cringe to wake up to the next Sandy Hook...to the next Lad Vegas...to the next war Israel goads us into ..</p>

<p>I&#39;m tired of being Israel&#39;s bodyguard and I&#39;m tired of the amount of money we throw away due to Israel being spooked at every Muslim country they think is going to attack them.</p>

Maybe 10% of those willing to fight are trained. This is not a winning fight. It&#39;s just not possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I strongly dislike our gun laws. I feel they are very restrictive, and I would change it if I could. Indeed, though <strong>I do not oppose mental screenings</strong>, and I believe that is one of the things being discussed there. </p>

<p>The problem is that this isn&#39;t just about guns. Its not just about the hot button issue of the day. Today its your guns on the table, tomorrow it could be your free speech, as it is here. ( See bill C16.) It&#39;s about rights, and about freedom. And we seem to have less and less as time goes on.</p>

<p>I guess at the end of the day, I&#39;m here because I feel helpless. I see something that I disagree with, and I feel the need to do something. But instead of actually doing something, I&#39;m here. Because I&#39;m weak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of all the things you&#39;ve felt, did you ever feel afraid that you would be shot at school? And with restrictive gun laws and encroaching speech laws, wouldn&#39;t you argue that Canada is closer to a government genocidal takeover than the US? </p>

<p>I think a big problem that I see with this discussion is the polarization. I think we all can acknowledge that there should be, universally, some laws that restrict <em>certain types</em> of people from owning firearms, right? I mean, do you think that convicted felons of violence or domestic abuse should be able to purchase firearms? Should an 11 year old be able to buy a gun? I think those are both clear cut cases of how we need to have some gun control. The fact that the perpetrator of the Parkland shooting was known to police, FBI and their community as being a threat, repeatedly, and with all of this information, this individual was still able to legally purchase the weapon he used in that massacre. That&#39;s a gross failure all around, and a prime example of how gun reform should be considered.</p>

<p>Like you said, mental health screenings are a great step and I&#39;m all for that as well. All in all the polarization of this issue is a frustrating waste of time because neither side is accomplishing what they want. I don&#39;t believe we should be wasting time talking about banning bump stocks and AR-15s. I think anyone who is responsible enough to own those should be able to if they want. I own guns myself. </p>

<p>I am vehemently opposed to the lax gun laws down here. I live in one of the most lax gun areas in the States. I&#39;m not afraid of being shot intentionally; I&#39;m afraid of some dumb fuck, who thinks he&#39;s a cowboy because he bought a gun and carries it and never practices with it, is going to accidentally shoot me or someone I care about. </p>
