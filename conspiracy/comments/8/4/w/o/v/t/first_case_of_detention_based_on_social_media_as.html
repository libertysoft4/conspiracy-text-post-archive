        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the wake of the alleged Florida shooting, much discussion has occurred surrounding preemptive detention. </p>

<p>Sheriff Israel has received much media coverage for his calls for police to have authority to make mental health diagnoses necessitating detention and treatment, <em>instead of</em> mental health professionals, as is currently the case. </p>

<p>He also calls for power of preemptive detention based on &quot;disturbing&quot; social media posts, which will be determined at police discretion, but which he has mentioned may specifically include imagery or mention of &quot;guns&quot;, rifles&quot;, &quot;bombs&quot;, or &quot;blood&quot;. </p>

<p>News story released yesterday:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/15/593799322/sister-of-charleston-shooter-dylann-roof-arrested-after-menacing-social-media-po">Sister Of Charleston Shooter Dylann Roof Arrested After Menacing Social Media Post</a></p>

<p>Dylann Roof&#39;s sister, Morgan Roof, was arrested based on a social media post criticizing the student walkout, wishing violence upon the participants. </p>

<p>However notably, as stated by the school principal, the post was &quot;hateful&quot; and &quot;inappropriate&quot;, but &quot;<em>not a threat</em>&quot;. </p>

<p>Based on the post, she was arrested.</p>

<p>Her belongings were then searched, to reveal pepper spray, a knife, and pot. She was charged with possession of weapons on school property. </p>

<p>The governor has stated that a &quot;potential tragedy was avoided&quot;. </p>

<p>This story very neatly justifies the recent calls for detention based on non-threatening, but &quot;disturbing&quot; social media posts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The article specifically states that she was arrested <em>based on</em> the social media post. </p>

<p><em>Then</em> her belongings were searched and the knife was found. </p>

<p>&quot;Hallelujah! Potential tragedy avoided. Thank goodness for this new police practice of preemptive detention based on inflammatory-but-non-threatening social media posts that we&#39;ve been calling for.&quot;</p>

<p>A little convenient IMO.</p>

<p>There&#39;s certainly a role for schools to play in the social development of students, if a student is known to be exhibiting &quot;hateful&quot; or &quot;inappropriate&quot; behavior. </p>

<p>However there&#39;s a big difference between being sent to the principal&#39;s office and being arrested. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I am also fine with my kid being charged with a crime if they are found with a weapon in that school.</p>

<p>The point is the timeline i.e. precedent of probable cause being demonstrated in regards to police action. </p>

<p>Disturbing/hateful/inappropriate social media post = probable cause for arrest =&gt; subsequently used as probable cause for search.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, even as recently as my father’s time in high school people were allowed to have guns, though it was usually only in their vehicles (because why do you need it?).  Nearly everyone had a knife in their pocket.  Now, a knife and pepper-spray is an issue?   What if she had been bullied?  What if she’d been threatened?  </p>

<p>Oh, yeah.  Kids are supposed to trust their elders to handle those kinds of situations (because they’re always around, available, trustworthy, and sincerely concerned about someone else’s kid but, more so, going to an adult never causes more issues than it fixes.) /s</p>

<p>Kids, bring a knife everywhere.  Bring a gun where you can.  It may just save your life one day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A school is free to make rules about whether weapons are allowed on its premises. A school also has the right to talk to or punish a student for &quot;hateful&quot; or &quot;inappropriate&quot; behavior. </p>

<p>&quot;Hateful&quot; or &quot;inappropriate&quot; social media posts do not warrant arrest. </p>

<p>Or they <em>should</em> not, but they likely will soon if the laws being demanded by police in the wake of Parkland are passed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, it makes sense that that type of social media post cannot be used for arrest. Unless it is a sting caught on camera, there is no way for police to claim that actual drugs were actually being sold. </p>

<p>It <em>is</em> legal for police to detain someone if they express immediate threat of harm. Which is reasonable. If someone says &quot;I&#39;m going to go shoot up a school&quot;, police should be able to take action and they <em>can</em> take action. </p>

<p>However, what police are pushing for now, is to be able to detain <em>without any threat of harm</em>. If by their own discretion they find something &quot;disturbing&quot; or &quot;inappropriate&quot;, they want the authority to preemptively detain you. </p>

<p>This story is just a textbook example of exactly the power they want, with a perfect &quot;tragedy averted&quot; ending to justify that power. </p>

<p>But someone admitting online that they sell drugs is certainly just cause for a search warrant.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny because there were tons of posts after the murders saying it was all the FBI&#39;s fault because they didn&#39;t arrest the kid before it happened as they were too busy investigating Trump.</p>

<p>If by funny, you mean, incredibly convenient given the current legal push to remove basic civil rights of probable cause, yes it is &quot;funny&quot; indeed. </p>

<p>How is that contrary to what I said? Mk Ultra implies they were patsies. </p>
