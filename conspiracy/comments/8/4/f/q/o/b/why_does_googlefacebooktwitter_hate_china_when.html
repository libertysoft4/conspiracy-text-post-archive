Yes, China Level Censorship is the in thing of the internet giants. So why are they complaining about china censoring the internet while they are doing exactly the same?</p>

<p>China pretty much blocked the sites from entering it because it&#39;s scared of a color revolution takeover, but the way that the internet giants are acting makes it seem like a hypocritical deal.</p>

<p>you&#39;d still have to show that the conclusion is false, which would probably be difficult since by your own words both entities are censoring people for profit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s so hard to follow?</p>

<p>Oppression by a government is <strong>NOT</strong> the same as oppression by a for-profit corporation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious that government is higher up in the hierarchy than private corporations. Equating them is a fallacy. </p>

<p>Still confused?</p>

<p>If a government censors something they use every tentacle in media, print, radio, and Internet to follow through. They will also enforce the censorship by policing and encouraging citizens to report breaches.</p>

<p>If a private corporation censors something it&#39;s only scrubbed off the corporation&#39;s platform. The only enforcement of this censorship occurs on the platform. You can literally get off the platform and either use a different platform or form of communication to bypass the censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because equating or analogizing two different things is only a fallacy if the conclusion is false, and again even by your own words you say both are &quot;oppressive&quot;. </p>

<p>according to people like you if there was a corporation or cartel that owned all media platforms and censored anybody who criticized them it would somehow be fundamentally different than a world government doing the same. But yes, I&#39;m the confused one.</p>
