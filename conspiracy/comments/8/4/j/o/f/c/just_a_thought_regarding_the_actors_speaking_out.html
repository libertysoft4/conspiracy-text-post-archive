Is it possible that there genuinely is a groundswell of youthful activism going on in USA schools against the insanity that is the USA&#39;s obsession with gun fetishism? Does this suggest that the Parkland students were, and are, genuine victims who spoke out against the (actual) Powers That Be, and were shamefully denounced as &quot;crisis actors&quot; by stupid, right-wing keyboard warriors?<br/>
Or are they ALL crisis actors in the pocket of the Democrats, or whatever the fuck?</p>

<p>I&#39;m someone on the Left and I believe in gun rights and feel it is necessary that a citizenry be armed...otherwise how else are we supposed to guarantee our government does what <em>we</em>want? How can I entrust them with National Healthcare or College/Trade education if I don&#39;t have the force of arms, along with millions of others, to ensure they do this? </p>

<p>How exactly do you consider it a realistic option for you - to &quot;rise up&quot; with your guns against the military police that run your country? </p>

<p>It is about the theoretical power- where does it lie? Does it lie with an armed citizenry, from whose sovereignty the country is drawn? Or does it lie only with an ephemeral Federal Power? An armed citizenry possesses the final check and balance of a Free Society. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you seriously think you are anything other than piteously outgunned? Has that escaped your notice, somehow?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ever heard of the Mujaheddin? Or Al&#39; Qaeda? Or the Vietcong? Small arms and a determined populace are the bane of any and all organized occupational forces...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The answer, obviously, is that you live in a democracy. You make changes by voting, not shooting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We live in a Representative Republic, dictated by Parties that represent class interests...and not the class interests of the common citizen. While the vote still does have power, it is essential that the ultimate power of violence rests with the People and the People alone. As I said- without arms, how else can I assure that my government actually distributes the Healthcare benefits and the Education? Force guarantees that We The People remain the source from which the Power of our government derives itself. </p>

<p>No...I&#39;m highlighting the reality that the strongest army the world has ever seen <em>still</em> hasn&#39;t beaten an insurgency we&#39;ve fought for 15 goddamn years...just like we never beat the Vietcong...despite the fact that both are/were armed, predominantly, with small arms...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s not. Where the power rests, even in theory, is essential. An armed citizenry means there is always the potential for revolt and opposition...it is absolutely integral to a True and Free Republic. Small arms ensure that a resistance movement can always be waged...as I have said, militarist movements throughout history prove this...</p>

<p>That&#39;s a really funny statement lol...how do I lack critical thinking just because I am able to critically analyze a YouTube video based on its merit and not on the credibility of who produced it (an average citizen)? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fighting rebels in foreign, war-torn territory is not the same thing as quelling local resistance. </p>

<p>Ultimately, power derives from legitimacy in the eyes of a (implicitly) consenting population. Invading forces tend to create just as many adversaries as they kill. Their actions are never seen as justified. </p>

<p>The domestic &quot;armed citizenry&quot; in conflict at home is either one side of a &quot;legitimate&quot; claimant to the state (thus, in the case of the US - it will be well-armed and organized such as during the Civil War) or a small, fringe group with no significant support from the general populace.</p>

<p>Afghanistan et al. are bad comparisons due to power vacuums of failed states and the resulting ethnic/tribal basis of legitimacy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The kids are emotional and idealistic kids, with ideas they think could help but generally don&#39;t have life experiences that promote gun ownership and probably have little understanding of gun functionality and gun law.  That makes them an easily used mouthpiece for gun control, but it doesn&#39;t make them actors.  I think they need to do research so they are talking from a position of knowledge and not JUST emotion, but since its important to them, they shouldn&#39;t be told to shut up (just be taken with a grain of salt)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;ve got a lot of life experiences of gun functionality and gun law - they see their peers dying, because America is arming itself to death. You couldn&#39;t possibly ask for a better &quot;research&quot; environment than a contemporary American school. To tar them for daring to get &quot;emotional&quot; about the potential for death by eduction is disengenuous - is there any political issue that is not tempered by emotions? Are they actually concentrating on emotional messages (like the NRA does) or are they in fact clearly articulating a political stance, in the midst of aggressive, emotionally laden criticism from the right wing gun stroking psychotics that maintain power?</p>

<p>You&#39;re clearly planning on dismissing statements anywhere to the right of the kids calling for more controls, maybe we need some, but the timing of the calls is intentionally exploitative and in the case of Parkland missing the context of the incident, I wrote a little rant about other places we could be spending our energy, 
 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/84j9i0/nothing_we_could_do_horseshit_and_i_dont_mean_a/">https://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/84j9i0/nothing_we_could_do_horseshit_and_i_dont_mean_a/</a>  but its always the same shit being shouted from the left, and its often shit that infringes rights without creative a real benefit, so of course us evil gun owners push back, but its not from a place of wishing children brutally murdered </p>
