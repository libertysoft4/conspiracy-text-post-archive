        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This has been happening periodically now for weeks. But as of recently, it&#39;s like I see 4 threads a day saying how bad or how political this sub has become. But look at r/conspiracy in 2010, there were a lot of political themed threads then:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100212053800/reddit.com//r/conspiracy">https://web.archive.org/web/20100212053800/reddit.com//r/conspiracy</a> </p>

<p>Why would people attempt again and again to discredit the sub? What would they gain from making it seem like its been corrupted?</p>

<p>These threads make it to the top every time. Definitely some vote manipulation there.</p>

<p>They are posting and supporting bs conspiracy themes and targeting those that follow, push, or argue them. My guess is to sway views on agenda items, or election policy.

    <div class="md"><p>This is my take too. I think we should limit meta-posts (not self-posts) to Saturdays or Sundays to cut back on it; not just to improve the day-to-day quality, but if shills are making those sorts of posts, then they&#39;ll have to be paid overtime. </p>

<p>Of course, the moderation in this sub must be a huge pain in the arse as it is. Maybe the new additions will help?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should all call out their stupid narrative when they post it too. </p>

<p>The two biggest threads yesterday were anti-Trump. Anti-Trump information gets plenty of views here. The problem is that many people don&#39;t realize it. I&#39;ve seen countless comments upvoted to the sky, occasionally guided, posting anti-Trump information. Sometimes they say &quot;This sub is completely controlled by Trump supporters,&quot; yet they are upvoted and guilded. You would expect the lightbulb to go off in their head, but I guess not. Who is upvoting those comments if this sub is &quot;T_D 2.0?&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7yylhs/what_the_hell_happened_to_this_sub/dukdaeb/">A small list of big anti-Trump threads that many people here pretend don&#39;t exist,</a> and this is just what I could find from a quick search. There are recent threads and some going back to a year ago. This sub has always had big anti-Trump threads. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so, I&#39;m one of the users you guys would be talking about let me explain my reasoning, ive been coming to this sub for a while and in the past there was more content diversity and just for our purposes we will label it non political and political even though its not that black and white. The reason I, and I&#39;m sure many other users here are missing the non political posts are because theyre fun to theorize about I love watching stuff on ancient civilizations and alternative history along with supernatural or unexplained occurrances, it plays into my curious nature for the unknown. Its damn good content. Then we have the political content do I care about it and read it? Yes! Its important to me to always be seeking a truth that I believe is hidden from me.

<p>There still is. The problem is the upvote/downvote system. It&#39;s not on the front page always, but it&#39;s there.</p>

<p>Yes, I know. Which is why I and others here are calling you guys out. You guys just want <a href="/r/HistoryChannel">/r/HistoryChannel</a> or <a href="/r/PopConspiracy">/r/PopConspiracy</a>. I like it too, that&#39;s how I got started into it, but this whole talk of &quot;going back to the old days&quot; is just dumbing the sub down. And as I said above, that content is already here just not on the front page. So really, you just want it to be even easier to see what you want than to just scroll through a couple pages by pressing a button/tapping you screen. Also, I visit <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> for pop conspiracy shit, by the way. If you want to theorize and be amazed by gifs that tap into that, thats the place to go. Or to be amazed by what is &quot;proof&quot; to people. Either way, good stuff. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>And again, that&#39;s why people here are calling you guys out. You&#39;re admitting yourself it&#39;s just a dumbed-down version of what we have now to make you feel less depressed about &quot;real&quot; conspiracies with evidence that affect your lives.</p>

<p>And that plays right into the mentality used against us on this site and in society. They think we believe certain conspiracies because it makes it easier to swallow the reality of a situation. That we are just potheads theorizing about shit we saw on the History Channel like ancient aliens going &quot;the Maaan is totally hiding the alien bodies, mann. It&#39;s a conspiraccyyy&quot;. That&#39;s exactly what you want the sub to become. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s fine, I guess. Because the shit I visit this sub for will still be here, and I&#39;ll still have to scroll to find it. And that&#39;s okay.</p>

People don&#39;t want you considering political topics because that&#39;s too close to the more important conspiracies, like the fact that democracy doesn&#39;t exist or that America is a global empire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like a good Conspiracy theorist should always gravitate toward the political, and ignore the partisan.</p>

<p>There used to be a consistent questioning of Bush, Clinton, and Obama. But for some reason with Trump there is an instant assumption that he&#39;s guilty of nothing, or he&#39;s guilty of creating the common cold. </p>

<p>That split is why people think this place is dying. Everyone views every political post through partisan lenses and either tries to argue either democrats or republicans/russia is behind every conspiracy. Despite the token posts about how they&#39;re both wings of the same bird, the comment sections seem to treat it like a one or the other thing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not politics. It&#39;s partisanship.</p>

<p>What is &quot;anti-antisemitism&quot;? You mean I am against those speak out against shits committed Israel and her ilks?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Using the term &quot;antisemitism&quot; exclusively for Jews/Israel is itself an abuse cos Arabs are mostly &quot;Semites&quot; as well. Which I categorically reject, and it&#39;s low and it&#39;s shame.</p></li>
<li><p>I am not against those who speak their mind against Bad Jews/Israel. So, there is no &quot;anti-antisemitism&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Hiding the truth is neither &quot;antisemitism&quot; nor &quot;anti-antisemitism&quot;.... It&#39;s against freedom, it&#39;s plain crime against humanity. </p></li>
