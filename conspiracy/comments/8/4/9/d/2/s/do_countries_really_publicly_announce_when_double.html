    <div class="md"><p>I just don’t understand what reason in 2018 Russia would have to kill a guy that they knew had flipped and swapped with the U.K. in 2010.</p>

<p>Skripal was known to Russia as a traitor (from Russia’s POV) 8 years ago. Why make an example of him now, 8 years later, at a time when the entire world is just begging for an excuse to levy more pain on Russia.</p>

<p>Also, why use a method that basically screams “It’s us. Russia. We murdered Skripal.”</p>

<p>It’s like a robber goes into a house and then thinks “wait, I better take my gloves off so I leave my finger prints all over this place.”</p>

<p>The U.K. and the international community is absolutely in the right to petition for answers, but to attribute blame immediately just seems short sighted.</p>

<p>So I guess we are left to think that Russia is simultaneously a master of espionage but so sloppy that they leave obvious finger prints everywhere.</p>

<p>Maybe Russia did do it. The issue I have is that the concept that Russia did not do it is not even being entertained.</p>

<p>I mean, fuck me for wanting a bunch of nations with nukes, run by sociopaths, to actually conduct an investigation before provoking each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m talking conventional military.</p>

<p>On either side they both have enough nuclear power to destroy the entire planet several times over.</p>

<p>Individually they can each destroy the world. After a certain point the number of nukes don’t matter, the fact that you have nukes (plural) does.</p>

<p>And if number of nukes is all that matters then who the fuck cares what the US’ stance is? It’s irrelevant to the conversation if we’re just going on number of nukes.</p>

<p>100 nukes can kill the earth. The UK has 215. So the U.K. can destroy the entire earth twice and then some.</p>

<p>So who cares who has more when each power can destroy the entire world by themselves?</p>

<p>No this is stupid because after the nukes are done falling everyone is already dead and no military conflict in history has ever started with nukes launching first.</p>

<p>What the other commenter neglects to mention is the SCO is not a formal military alliance like NATO. It is an organization for economic and strategic cooperation.</p>

<p>China and Russia have repeatedly denied it’s ever even going to become a formal military alliance like NATO. So to assume every SCO member would back Russia militarily is an assumption since there’s not formal requirement for them to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The Telegraph reported that if the Kremlin believed Skripal helped compile the Trump dossier, it could provide a motive for the assassination attempt in Salisbury.</p>

<p>A former Russian construction magnate told Channel 4 News Skripal was “working in cyber-security and every month going to the [Russian] embassy to meet military intelligence officers”.</p>

<p>The Telegraph said a “hit squad” was dispatched by the Kremlin to assassinate Skripal, to send a message that traitors were not tolerated.</p>

<p>UK intelligence services suspect the attack was delayed by the snowstorm that enveloped Britain last week, which kept Skripal and his daughters indoors and made the assassination squad’s escape from the country more problematic.</p>

<p>“By Sunday afternoon, with Miss Skripal on the brink of returning to Moscow, the assassination squad had little room for manoeuvre and were forced into action in broad daylight in the middle of a busy shopping precinct,” the Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>And sure maybe that’s my mistake. I generally think powerful individuals act in their own self interest. Skripal’s assassination isn’t well timed for Putin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since when does exchanging captured spies with another country that&#39;s captured some of your own ever get publicised or reported? Clearly it&#39;s an embarrassment to both sides that they want to keep quiet not publicly admit they were even involved in much less caught in the act. </p>

<p>Moreover this spy was a Russian Intelligence official guilty of betraying agents of his own country for a $100,000 bribe and was caught and sentenced to 13 years for it. </p>

<p>He&#39;s hardly a hero, merely a less than scrupulous character who&#39;s loyalty to his country and those who worked with him for that country could be bribed and bought-off by foreign agents.</p>

<p>And as for any PR value, the story has only been made public NOW not when it actually happened and he was quietly swapped for a captured Russian agent and given asylum since he&#39;s chosen to be an exile from his own country rather than serve out his sentence, not &quot;amnesty&quot; as you call it since he wasn&#39;t guilty of anything in the U.K.</p>

<p>This all completely untrustworthy propaganda with MI6 getting some extra mileage out this former paid informer in order to conveniently blame the Russians for attempting to do him in.</p>

<p>I agree. The desperate attempt to assign blame without due process is what makes me uneasy about this situation. I feel like they&#39;re using this person&#39;s murder as a mere prop for political theater to push for a retaliation against Russia. I don&#39;t understand why so many seem to desire direct war with Russia. It&#39;s either that they&#39;ve forgotten about the basic idea of mutually assured destruction or they actually want mutually assured destruction. </p>

<p>I think this is very possible too. Putin was put into power by being #2 behind Boris Yeltsin. Putin was chosen by Yeltsin to follow him too. This is interesting because the US meddled in the 1996 election in Russia to put Yeltsin in power. Thinking of this, it&#39;s interesting to remember that Putin has been close with both the Bushes and the Clintons. Maybe all this anti-Russia hysteria is a completely manufactured scheme and Putin is actually in on it, so nothing will actually happen to the US. </p>

<p>Putin has been openly assassinating former spies since <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-19647226">at least 2006</a>. Of course there are simpler, less obviously connected to Russia methods of killing a person. That&#39;s not the point.</p>
