        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am well aware of the elite’s agenda of dumbing down our children through the ridiculousness that is the US public school system, but I am now seeing it firsthand as I am new to being a step-parent full time. In the Baltimore County Public School system, which is different (but not much anymore) than Baltimore City Public Schools, there are no textbooks, or ebooks for that matter. They no longer have homework.  And when students don’t do graded class work on dittos, the lowest score that can be awarded is a 50%. This is for both middle school, and I’m hearing high school as well. </p>

<p>There are dittos, but that work is done in class, so even if parents want to help their children at home, there are no references to the material taught in class. The state has full control and parents have no part in it. I don’t even understand how kids are supposed to study for tests when all they have are dittos with fill in the blanks. </p>

<p>So kids are supposed to somehow ingest the material in class only and be tested on it. They test the hell out of them too. This is even for Spanish class. How can you learn a foreign language without practicing it at home? </p>

<p>I don’t get it, but then again I’m an old school learner B. I. Before Internet. Can someone try to explain a real reason for this? I can clearly see the conspiracy in this, but is there a logical explanation for this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One problem is that the parents are doing such a poor job preparing kids for school in the 5 years of life before kindergarten. I teach kindergarten and many students don’t know how to self regulate and are not taught situational awareness or basic respect. They are five years old and have never held a pencil or scissors, don’t know colors, have no number sense, etc. They come to school late every day, are not well rested, not ready to learn. It’s a shitshow.</p>

<p>In other words a federal law that &quot;mandates,&quot; that the state school funds be handed over to private and private for profit schools. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can speak on the 50% piece. The idea is that giving a 0 for not completing the work is statistically skewed as 70 - 100 percent is &quot;passing&quot; while 0-69 is &quot;failing.&quot; So, you only have a 30% window pass, with a mich wider window in which to fail. Along with this is the idea that to give a 0 in the gradebook is really grading &quot;responsibility&quot; and not &quot;ability&quot; or acquisition of material. So, it&#39;s an attempt at providing grades that match a student&#39;s knowledge and not her responsibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand but how my stepson looks at it is that he can do mostly nothing while getting a 50%, and then he will do the bare minimum to get it up to a D or C. In our day, we tried to complete everything knowing that just a few 0’s would hurt our grades in a big way. It encourages bare minimal performance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree to a point. The amount of homework should be moderate, not hours and hours long. My homework in the 80’s was an appropriate amount. Everyone who studies anything needs to sit down with the material the same day it is taught and practice it, especially in Math and foreign languages. How can you simply absorb that by sitting in class? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Schools are testing grounds for unproven educational programs. People writing educational policy (serving the parents of precious snowflakes and the suppliers of educational and testing materials) develop systems based on what they &quot;feel&quot; is good for students (and how they can cash in). Most sensible parents would not raise their own children in the manner public education serves them. Thus is not an attack on public education (which I fully support), but on policy and the destruction of standards.</p>
