There has been a very elaborate scheme to get people away from nature, parks, reservoirs, and campsites. There is also a huge push to discourage off-grid living. Many bizarre conspiracies regarding the manipulation of land and water.</p>

<p>&quot;The list of people who have mysteriously vanished in American national parks is shocking. US national parks are known for being majestic safe havens for wildlife, hikers, and families. Yet, as this shocking list shows, numerous men, women, and children have disappeared in some of the most beautiful and respected national parks in the United States. Where are these missing persons? What happened to them? Are America&#39;s national parks safe or are these national park disappearances something you should worry about?&quot;</p>

But really, i am a fan of the dresden files&#39; fantasy books by jim butcher. One of them makes a claim about the number of people in the usa who go missing or just vanish every year when describing to a mundane person how much we don&#39;t know and what could be in the shadows. I remember looking it up and the numbers compare to say, a heard of antelope being cut down in nature by large cats and wild predators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I favor the theory that there is an inter-dimensional explanation for it. Have you heard any of the stories where the missing person would show up weeks in a spot close to where they went missing that had already been searched many times? Check out David Paulides&#39;s books called Missing 411, he documents a ton of these unexplained and weird disappearences.</p>

<p>The guys over at Mysterious Universe love talking about the missing 411 cases. Here&#39;s a couple podcasts and articles from them: <a href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/tag/missing-411/">http://mysteriousuniverse.org/tag/missing-411/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard about that. A woman and some little boy. The woman was found in a searched area and the boy was found in a location any child couldn&#39;t get to (or an inexperienced adult). I know animals like wolves can&#39;t be gobbling them up because you&#39;d still find bones or torn scraps of clothes. I&#39;ve never camped/hike in that big of an area but I&#39;d at least leave a camp site or some makeshift site to show I was there. O.o</p>

<p>I havn&#39;t read this particular abs thread, but the details of Philip Taylor Kramer and his disapearence are quite bizare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in a remote area that&#39;s said to be squatch territory.  The local natives not only firmly believe in bigfoot, but also a whole host of bad things that live in the forest.  Stick Indians are one example.  Ever since I started hanging out with native guys at work I&#39;ve gained a healthy fear of some of the stuff that&#39;s said to be out there.  I spend a lot of time in the bush, and there are certain things I never do after being told not to by the guys.  Like whistling in the woods for example.</p>

<p>My grandmother tells this story of how she and my late grandfather were driving back to the valley one day after visiting family.  They were about a days drive away from home and were heading to a camp ground to spend the night in their camper.  The highway was closed before they could get to camp.  The cop at the roadblock told them there&#39;s been several sasquatch sightings and the road is closed while the hunting party searches.  Those cops were apparently dead serious, too.  Lots of the men in the town went out that night to hunt the bigfoot.  This was back in the 70&#39;s or early 80&#39;s.  The locals were terrified.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of weird stuff like that around here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stick Indians were described to me as a creatures that live in the woods.  Kind of like spirits, they&#39;re supposedly some kind of inter-dimensional being.  Just like bigfoot is said to exist in a different dimension or reality which is why the stories tell of its ability to appear / disappear.  Most native people that believe in them won&#39;t discuss them or even use their native word for stick indians - it&#39;s often avoided and is taboo to discuss.  It&#39;s best not to talk about them, and not to utter their name.</p>

<p>The stick indians hang out in the forest and like to play tricks on people if you get their attention.  If they find you amusing then they may behave benevolently, but if you annoy them they&#39;re said to do awful things and will try to kill you.  You can get their attention by whistling in the woods, disrespecting the plant and animal life, or even thinking about stick indians.  That&#39;s the hard part as its tough not to think about something when you&#39;re specifically told not to.  They can read your thoughts so you have to try and purge your mind and heart as best as possible before setting off.</p>

<p>The stick indians save their primary fuckery for the night time, but it can happen during the day as well.  They&#39;re said to trick people away from camp by emulating familiar sounds, often described as a group of people laughing and chatting with each other.  You get the impression that everything is okay and that you should go investigate the source of the sounds.  But that&#39;s how they get you.  Sometimes they&#39;ll kill and eat you, other times you&#39;ll just disappear completely without a trace.  If you ever hear sounds in the woods that seem intriguing but out of place you should never investigate them [particularly after dark].</p>

<p>There&#39;s more to it, but that&#39;s what comes to mind right now.  I suppose they&#39;re sort of like the native version of evil leprechauns.</p>
