<p>This lead to eventually coming to the conclusion that nobody died, nobody got hurt.</p>

<p>Which eventually led to the same realisation regarding 9/11 and the JFK &#39;assassination&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was what got me down this path because even at the age I was at the time I knew it didn&#39;t add up then got into highschool an had access to research as I pleased and confirmed my theory.  </p>

<p>So the day Sandy Hook happened I said it was a hoax on the book of faces and got called crazy.  It wasn&#39;t to long after it happened that people started opening their eyes to it tho. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t know it it&#39;s you become stagnate and close minded or you don&#39;t know what to believe anymore so you just believe what suits you. </p>

<p>It&#39;s 2018 now and I&#39;ve been into conspiracys since 07 and I don&#39;t think their could be anything that could come to light that would surprise me at this point. </p>

But the leftist media will jump on any story like that,.they don&#39;t care about the kids exploit them for pushing the narrative.

<p>I don&#39;t know if anybody but Adam Lanza died in that school but there is enough inaccuracies in the scenaio to make me question it. Same as 9/11. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That 9/11 was an inside job? Yeah clearly, I mean who wouldn&#39;t want thousands of Americans to die. And maybe we don&#39;t hear about the shootings stopped because of the actual mass shootings happening and killing children and hundreds of people. I mean, 7000 since Sandy Hook seems quite high. And that&#39;s just children alone. And so was Sandy Hook the only fake one? Why start them Then? Why not earlier?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean the logic?
I don&#39;t care for Alex Jones.</p>

<p>But I do know there was video footage of 3 people running from the school ( only one shooter tho), their where eye witness accounts of 2 buses full of kids that were being snuck away from the school. The weapons used in the shooting changed idr how many times. Barack Obama went and visited one of the children before school on the day she was shot, their was a charity page that&#39;s was created for the Sandy Hook shooting the day before the shooting actually happened and there&#39;s the crazy accuracy of these shooters that people just over look. (in all the shootings since Sandy Hook iirc they all have over 90% accuracy)</p>

<p>All of these school shootings since Sandy Hook HAS been planned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By logic I meant it to serve as basically a synonym for proof. As in why you and/or others believed it. Also, do you think you could link the video and any of that other stuff if you Can? I&#39;d love to be able to see it for myself. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not entirely sure if you&#39;re joking or not with the last line. You believe all school shootings since Snady Hook have been fake? Why did they start Then? And what does anyone gain from faking them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you don&#39;t mind me asking why did you believe they were killed? I personally question everything just who I am lol got my first detention for asking &quot;what if&#39; in science class to much lmao.</p>

<p>No no joke my guy. And not just the school shooting any sort of &quot;mass shooting&quot; attacks that have happened since 9/11 have been. They all have huge holes in the story coupled with the accuracy and precision of the perfect Patsy in &quot;mentally ill shooters&quot;.</p>

<p>Now for reasons why could vary largely from each one. It&#39;s thought that the Vegas shootings was to get a law into place in Vegas they required every public type building to have metal detectors. Ok so they install their metal detectors and the shootings stopped because they are not paying for them to happen. So then they go hey look our metal detectors stopped public shootings by this % in Vegas we should implement these in all public buildings and Bam they have just made trillions. ( Very simplified story don&#39;t recall the name of the company but it&#39;s owned by Sheldon aldeson) </p>

<p>But just a little side question what do you think the reason behind school windows not bein able to open and have steel mesh so they can&#39;t be broken is for? To keep children safe from our side attackers? Or to keep you from escaping.</p>

And I believe they were killed because the mass media reporting on it (as if the government made them do it, America would technically be a dictatorial state), as well as the continued campaigning of people surrounding it in the years since. And I struggle to see how they&#39;re perfect patsies. Is it only school shootings that have been faked? And what do you mean by accuracy and precision, as I&#39;m thinking you&#39;re referencing their aim but feel that&#39;s wrong? And I think that schools have those windows to stop people from breaking in and stealing supplies. That&#39;s what my school does, and I live in the UK. Also, just for the record, are you pro or anti gun control? Also what inconsistencies are there in the shootings, besides Sandy Hook obviously</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vegas happened. But it wasn&#39;t who they say shot them. And I think they are being used to instill fear so they can get people the agree to things while the tensions high. Sand hook was a completely fake (which they did try to push gun control almost immediately after) and you don&#39;t see how they are the perfect patsies ? Well I haven&#39;t been to the UK but in the states if you&#39;re a mentally ill individual (and commit a criminal) they can ignore your rights and discredit anything you say.  An no not just school shootings their was the &quot;Muslim&quot; in California a few years back who shot some people up that was fake, same with the Batman theater shooting. And yeah I&#39;m talking about the aim ( accuracy) being able to hit 90% of your bullets is crazy accurate and by precision I mean hit 90% of his shots and killed every Target. I will get back to this.  And yeah they claimed the same here. Except schools are funded with tax payer money and supplies are bought by teachers/ parents. To install such extreme security measures to stop a petty theft is the reason? I mean you cannot open the windows at the school I went to to fit threw. (I&#39;m 6ft 140 so I&#39;m pretty frickin thin lol) but the windows is a theory I had of my own. It was just a little wierd that in the early 2000s they switch to safer windows that are actually trapping people in these schools. Now on gun control I personally believe a utopian society is possible so I think we could do with out them but I personally could care less they aren&#39;t going to take ours unless we surrender them. I&#39;ve been shooting guns since the 5th grade (I&#39;m 25 now) and I started shooting a Bushmaster ar 15 in 9th grade and I can say with confidence that no one who has never shot a ar is going to be able to maintain such accuracy with such a fast rate of fire.( Iirc the Sandy Hook kid unloaded 3 clips in under two minutes or something like that) the numbers might not be exact but he shot a single shot rifle extremely fast and reloaded almost instantly with out a single misstep to achive shooting that fast. Now as I said I&#39;m rather thin an the kid who shot this place up was no bigger than me. You feel that shit after Everytime you shoot it&#39;s not like it&#39;s shown in cod or the movies their is quite a bit of recoil. What im saying is there&#39;s no way a un trained persons could do such things lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So who was the real Vegas shooter? As well as how, if they&#39;re all fake, no new gun laws that have majorly affected anything have been put in place. Also I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re on about the windows now, as I&#39;ve actually googled it, and nothing has cone up. And I&#39;ve gone 6 pages or so down so. And I know what you are saying by patsy. Except, how are they being blamed. Do these mentally ill shooters not exist? Nikolas Cruz isn&#39;t real? And yes well done. The <em>new</em>s wouldn&#39;t exist without <em>news</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who knows the shooter you have enough money you can buy whole army&#39;s. An you don&#39;t think ex Delta force or ex spetsnaz couldn&#39;t do these things with out being noticed? Lol </p>

<p>And the window part you won&#39;t find on the web as I said that was a theory of my own lol could just be coincidence but their really isn&#39;t a reason for the windows not being able to open enough to fit through. The way my school is set up that if a shooter would come into the school the only way out of the school is by going into the hallway.  Or cowering in the corner hoping he doesn&#39;t come in and kill you. An I swear on everything that was our drill for a school shooter. Lock the doors turn the lights off an hide in the corner like a tornado was coming wtf lol</p>

<p>And how are the mentally I&#39;ll not the perfect Patsy&#39;s? They would take little manipulation if any at all and if they are caught anything they say can be easily discredited. An also another theory of mine is that they are using this to use it to slowly strip away right from anyone with a mental illness. Which in America right now the number of people who have &#39;mental illnesses&quot; has been steadily increasing. So say here in a couple years they could go we cannot allow mentally I&#39;ll people to own guns and then all the sudden all these people who have &quot;mental illnesses&quot; like anxiety minor depression and other things that are now &quot;mental illnesses&quot; just had their right to bear arms infringed. Just a theory tho. </p>

<p>Yeah so if the news needs for their to be news daily in order to make money why would you believe anything they ever say? Lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sand hook?. Don&#39;t take anything I&#39;m saying as being a dick or ass or anything else just questions.</p>

<p>Did you actually see any bodies? At any of the funerals? Did you know or ever even hear of this Adam lanza before ?</p>

<p>And did you know the principal who was killed but looks identical to the woman who was killed in the Boston Marathon bombings?</p>

<p>If they had crisis actors replace whole familys you wouldnt know and you would probably let them cry on your shoulder 1) they are actors. 2) when something tragic like this happens no one is going to pay to close attention to the sobbing parents. So did any of the kids that where shot parents move after wards? Your close enough to find these things out.lol</p>

<p>But I do know I seen the one father smiling and laughing on camera, I have a 10mo daughter and let me tell you if something happened to her idk if I&#39;d be able to ever smile again let alone the same week she was gunned down in a elementary school</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) we did not see any bodies, the wake was a closed casket. Funerals were also closed, no one wanted to see dead children. 2) no one heard of Adam Lanza, Newtown is actually very large, and I don’t personally live in Newtown itself but right near it, most of my family does like in Newtown though, along with my uncle who lives in Sandy Hook. 
The funeral we attended, and the parents and brother of the child were good friends with my cousin, they could not be crisis actors. I know that as a fact. Most parents as far I know stayed in the town, some may have moved, and many have gotten threats and calls from across the nation saying they are crisis actors and that their children did not actually die.
 I don’t know all the facts at all, I can’t say I do, I know very little about the Lanza family but I do remember that this event was real, and had a lasting impact on the community. Anyone in the North East knows this was a real event. We don’t know much about Adam Lanza either( I remember hearing that he smashed his computer, could be a rumor though) and many people who lived near the school, one of which is a barber who cut my hair once and told me what he experienced, said they were about to run to the school with their rifles and see what was happening but decided to just call the police. Yet again, I don’t know all the facts, but I did experience this event and witnessed the community mourn over dead children, and the delegitimization of these poor kids is beyond saddening. I understand people who are hesitant to believe these, but understand that when politicians make drastic changes to gun laws, it doesn’t mean an event was fake or a hoax, it just means politicians want to get re-elected after a tragedy. I recall lots of people having trouble buying guns after Sandy Hook because the state legislature completely changed after it. Overall it was a horrible experience that no one in NW CT will ever forget. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no see it&#39;s tough over text lol but in no way was I trying to been morbid and seem like I have no sympathy. I was originally listing a bunch things I rember hearing when it happened and the kids being taken on a bus an then switched to a unmarked bus was one of them. But im almost certain that Adam lanza was dead before the shootings started or was Incapacitated till he was killed in the school. </p>

<p>But the people these things are happening too deserve to know the truth. </p>

The first time I have ever commented on this sub was today lol but if you would like the run down on how the people who are running the show got there watch the synagogue of Satan on YouTube it&#39;s 5 hours long lol. But yeah after you start down the rabbit hole eventually ( at least for me) you stop asking why they are doing these thing&#39;s an worry ok makeing sure what they are doing is brought to light. These people will kill whole bloodlines for a promise their great grandpa made 100 years ago so it&#39;s really hard to give the whys unless we are given that answer lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Buddy I own guns, I’m in the DEP for the Marines, and I don’t support disarming citizens. I’m simply stating that children died and I went to funeral of one of them, if you seriously are that horrible of a human being to disregard the life of a child because you think it’s some big conspiracy to disarm people, then that’s your problem. These kids did die, I can’t say for sure who did it and what really happened that day, but the fact of the matter is that children did die and it did impact our community heavily. </p>

I can’t remember his name but it was a little boy who loved the New York Giants, the running-back at the time even attended the wake and talked to people there. He donated a pair of cleats.

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s right, here&#39;s a good documentary about it <a href="https://youtu.be/N0tnYfBfzB0">The Life of Adam</a> I also recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/I1ATWDQ4OKE">Dear Wolfgang Revisiting Sandy Hook</a>, <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5x2tdp">Sandy Hook Link and Sinker</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/uhJrofgsnI4">We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook</a> if you give any of Hesse documentaries a watch for even just one hour, you will see that it was a hoax. My favorite one is Dear Wolfgang Revisiting Sandy Hook, but they all have different aspects which make them great, you can&#39;t go wrong with any of them. Also, here is a great article about why these hoax attacks are occurring rather than false flags with real victims. One thing to pay attention to is that there have been no lawsuits against the school or Nancy Lanza. This is unheard of. Parents often sue schools even when their child breaks their arm at recess, yet at Sandy Hook, 26 people died and there were no lawsuits from any of the survivors. This is not a coincidence. <a href="https://50shadesofpissedoff.com/2018/02/16/why-the-elite-use-the-hoax-model-instead-of-really-killing-people/">Why The Elite Use The Hoax Model Instead Of Really Killing People</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look man, I live in Ct, a few miles from sandy hook. I was in school when it happened and there were false rumors that there was a second shooter going west on 84. Because of that, all schools in the surrounding areas went into lockdown. I’m all for conspiracies and free thought, but I lived through this, it was real and children did die. I can’t say for sure what really happened that day but there was a school shooting, my cousin lives in Newtown and we all attended his friends little brothers funeral. A running back from the nfl was there and everything and Obama was also present. This was a real event, and it hurts the families and the community when people delegitimize this tragedy. Just my two cents mate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Campaigning as in parents of children killed in the Sandy Hook massacre stop campaigning to this day. Having looked over the article, it seems wildly inconsistent. It criticizes the parents for smiling about a memory of someone showing them support, but says they should be in tears about it. It also mentions the smiling, yes. Then does it with a WW2 vet and shows him smiling, then not, then goes on to criticize the parents for smiling cos they&#39;re &quot;doing it too soon&quot;.

<p>Have you read the final report from the Ct State Police? maybe you should start there then you&#39;d have an idea what everyone else is suspicious of.</p>

I provided pages on literal pages of photographic evidence of the families mourning, which, mind you, I imagine would be quite difficult to have a wide variety of. And I believe I&#39;ve already explained the mourning thing, but I&#39;ll go a bit more in depth, just for you. Mourning in public, isn&#39;t super common. Those family members mourn in private as well. It doesn&#39;t really make sense to me why they HAVE to be bawling their eyes out for you to believe them.

    <div class="md"><p>Lack of evidence or withholding of evidence is what makes me think twice. </p>

<p>No video evidence on this one. The Florida one no footage of any shooter in the school at all. Las Vegas no video at all not one video of the shooter who stayed in a las Vegas strip casino for a week. The only image is a still shot with his eyes closed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But by that logic of there being a lack of video evidence or whatever, I can say that thousands of soldiers in Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan never died because there&#39;s no video proof for a lot of them.

<p>Each event is unique I guess. </p>

<p>The Iraq war they were showing a lot of video on CNN etc from day one. Embedded reporters was a big thing I remember. </p>

<p>Being told we can&#39;t see the footage for one reason or another is a red flag to me. Zero Vegas footage of the shooter  is an example. Plenty must exist. Not a single still image from the day let alone surveillance video in a place with thousands of cameras. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty shit math tbh. 16 now so yeah. Sandy Hook actually HAPPENED in 2012, so you add 6 to that, and get 2018. You add 6 to 11, you get 17. I&#39;m turning 17 this year idiot. And no I find Disney channel shows somewhat overrated, I never really found them incredibly entertaining as a child. Although I could have been biased, I was watching a lot of movies and tv shows, as well as playing video games waaaaay too mature for me at that age. Cartoon Network is pretty good overall, although now that Regular Show, Amazing World of Gumball and Adventure Time are all over or ending, I am kinda worrying for it&#39;s future as a channel, as Teen Titans Go was somewhat of a let down, but considering the targeted audience in mind, it&#39;s not half bad.</p>

<p>Can someone possibly explain to me the reasoning/logic behind believing the Sandy Hook shooting was faked?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To begin with, you are asking the wrong question.  Instead of looking for why it was <em>not</em> real...you should ask what evidence is there that it is real?  Go back and look at it again and this time watch it as closely as you would if you were viewing a magic show.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with using the ideas of others to point out the flaws of the official version, but that is just a start.  You need to confirm those things yourself, because if you don&#39;t then you will always be left wondering whether they were real or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were no bodies that anyone has seen, no blood (compare photos to comumbine and you&#39;ll see what I mean there would have been blood everywhere), nets were not allowed in only a few select people, there are videos of people entering the fire station and exiting in a circle over and over, multiple witness lied or changed there story, the school had no maintence records and seemed to be school, a couple of the pictures that were said to be of the dead children were stolen from Facebook and a mother called them out and got pissed because her daughter was alive and they lived in another state, the shooters handprints were not on the car that showed up, they sealed the death records of every kid, they caught a man in cameo in the woods and never talked about it, they lied about the mom working at the school, the school removed the video camera,  a bunch of houses sold on the same day for $1 and I could go on and on but you get the picture</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But by that logic of there being a lack of video evidence or whatever, I can say that thousands of soldiers in Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan never died because there&#39;s no video proof for a lot of them. Also, what do you constitute as proof? A video of the shooter at the time of shooting? Or a video of the shooter with a gun, high quality and while shooting?</p>
