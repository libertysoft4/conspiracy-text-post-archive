<p>Some one else put it best in a past comment on this post: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/83swzs/1000_children_may_have_been_victims_in_britains/">https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/83swzs/1000_children_may_have_been_victims_in_britains/</a> </p>

<p>The following is the comment from the post:{</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is reddit allowing this dialog to exist?</p>

<p>They have suppressed discussion of Rotherham, Telford, Oxford, and the other rings.</p>

<p>Edit: The story made one of the two &quot;ban you instantly if you don&#39;t Feel the Bern&quot; subreddits yesterday, and the FP because of it. r / worldnes or r / news.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of time before this was going to make more than the Conservative press or tabloids. The charge is undeniable: there is widespread and continuing exploitation of children by specific ethno-religious groups in Britain that dwarfs any other sex scandal in recent Western history.</p>

<p>So I wonder if reddit and their ilk are letting the story float because it was getting to bursting point trying to ignore what is a 12 ton elephant in a room of normal reddit concerns like Trump&#39;s social media activity.</p>

<p>P.S Not sure If I can permalik or not. If I can i&#39;ll add it in an edit here </p>

<p>Edit: formated link for better visibility &amp; better explained that the above mentioned links are from another redditor who commented on the post.</p>

<p>Edit2: For those who say that i&#39;m defending russia. I wholehartedly believe that they did, do and forever will use assassinations as a viable political instrument for both domestic and external policy. I have no love for them whatsoever. </p>

<p>What I was pointing out to was that the media is blowing this new news way out of proportion, to the point of drowning out other news items </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazingly, I’ve just turned on the BBC Newswatch programme (where they air criticisms from viewers) and the presenters are asking both “Has the BBC been too quick to swallow the official story about the Russian involvement in the poisoning?” <em>and</em> “Was the BBC too slow to report on the Telford child trafficking scandal?”</p>

<p>I am categorically not a fan of what the BBC has become in recent years, but this is quite a refreshing level of self awareness and openness. Something I was not expecting at all. This is at 7:50am on a Saturday morning which is basically prime time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so, Reddit and the news covered it. Then something else happened, and now they are covering that. Is there some reason this is unusual?</p>

<p>It really isn&#39;t that suspicious: is there any ongoing information from the British investigation on child abuse, or do you want them to just talk about child abuse for days on end, while people are getting poisoned by nerve gas, possibly by a foreign agent?</p>

<p>If they were still talking about the child abuse, we here would be talking about why they are drowning out all the reporting on nerve gas with child abuse PSAs -- and that has a real virtue signalling component attached to it to draw attention away from the nerve gas: &quot;Why do you want to talk about nerve gas, there are children being abused! You monster!&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a connection. At least, probably not. The nerve gas is a developing story and, as you noted, most uncommon than these child abuse stories. It&#39;s going to get more attention.</p>

<p>But now it&#39;s off the news and forgotten like the other person is saying is happening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it forgotten? Speculative.</p>

<p>Is the news supposed to report on what happened last week? Unless there&#39;s new information, it&#39;s not news. Considering it was reported on literally less than a week ago, has it really been forgotten yet?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So no push from the public to investigate and find out how deep it goes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article posted says there has been a push to investigate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lucy Allan, the Conservative MP for Telford, has called for an inquiry into child sexual exploitation, saying the latest reports were &quot;extremely serious and shocking&quot;. She has previously called for a &quot;Rotherham-style inquiry&quot; into the allegations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Otherwise, what do you expect them to publish? &quot;Public demands inquiry&quot;? That&#39;s not news.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like when it happened within the UK government and at the BBC in the not so distant past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Yewtree">There was a criminal investigation that results from BBC-Saville case.</a> You just weren&#39;t looking for it.</p>

<p>So, I don&#39;t get it. I feel like you have unreasonable expectations for what the media is supposed to report on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I&#39;m missing something since the sex abuse rings you cited all seem to be from 2015 or before, so I am not getting how a 2018 story is connected to covering up things that were identified 3-20 years ago. Is 3-20 years later really &quot;just the right time?&quot;</p>

<p>Aylesbury: &quot;In July 2015, they were found guilty of offences including rape and child prostitution over a period extending from 2006 to 2012.&quot;</p>

<p>Banbury: &quot;In March 2015, they were found guilty of offences including rape and sexual activity with a child over a period extending from 2009 to 2014.&quot;</p>

<p>Bristol: &quot;In November 2014, they were convicted of offences including rape, paying a child for sex, causing or inciting child prostitution, sexual acts with children and sex trafficking.&quot;</p>

<p>Derby: &quot;Nine of the 13 accused were convicted of grooming and raping girls between 12 and 18 years old.&quot;</p>

<p>Keighley: &quot;In December 2015, they were found guilty of rape and other forms of sexual abuse by a unanimous jury verdict at Bradford Crown Court. They were sentenced in February 2016 to a total of 130 years in jail&quot;</p>

<p>So those are the first 5, so I&#39;m trying to figure out how, again, a 2018 story is covering up convictions from 2015 or before and why OP thinks this is &quot;just The right time to drown&quot; out 3 year old news.</p>

<p>Although I do get that OP is presenting cherry-picked data about Muslims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you for real? The abuse of thousands of children by organised gangs has been a big story in England for many years. It is such a complex problem that the government has struggled to conduct a full enquiry into the problem, because they are unable to find enough highly trained people to run it who don&#39;t have a connection in some way to the accused. It has been a long running story that is still regularly reported on. There has not been a sudden wakening to the problem in the last few weeks or months. It goes back years.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile">A turning point could be the death of Jimmy Savile, and the subsequent opening of the flood gates of allegations</a>. This was when the British people really became aware of scale of the problem. The, predominantly, Pakistani paedophiles who are grooming and raping thousands of vulnerable girls is a problem that has been going on for a long time, too. People aren&#39;t just waking up to it. Solving it is going to take time. </p>

<p>The &quot;nerve agent&quot; story is hinky as fuck. I would lay money on the British government using it as a way to indefinitely postpone Brexit. The rush to classify it as Novichok is curious and misleading. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent">Novichok is not a single chemical substance but a series of differing chemicals</a> and the evidence of it being the culprit is non-existent. More and more people are questioning it. I think it&#39;s Theresa May&#39;s attempt to replicate the success of the Falklands War that Thatcher enjoyed. </p>

<p>Two big stories. Well, three, actually. Brexit forecasts from the government show its going to be a disaster for the UK and suddenly, BOOM, we&#39;re in a situation where we really need the EU and NATO. It all stinks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>meh, i was just speculating that the nerve agent poisoning might&#39;ve been in part to quell surging pedophilia awareness, that might not be it at all.  was just saying to the guy above that it&#39;s not necessarily about when some known incidents ocurred (especially when the problem is systemic and ongoing anyway) it&#39;s about dealing with pressure from the public when it arises.  he was arguing a strawman.  i can&#39;t agree that the British government merely hasn&#39;t figured out how to get a handle on it, it&#39;s not just gangsters that are doing this.  it&#39;s people in high positions of power, as you mention.  Jimmy Saville, being BBC royalty, was an example of how institutionalized the problem is.  Ted Heath another one.  i really have a hard time believing that when people like Ted Heath are involved that the government is merely &#39;struggling&#39; to get a handle on it, as if some political will actually exists among government to deal with a criminal network they themselves and other powerful elite are directly a part of.  it&#39;d be one thing if it were just organized street crime responsible, it&#39;s another when your elected officials and celebrities are all tied in to this network.  it&#39;s obvious that there&#39;s been and will be no real enquiry in to it because of who&#39;s involved and where it would lead.</p>

<p>your thoughts on why the Novichok might&#39;ve been deployed are probably a better fit than what i was saying tho.  hard to pinpoint exact motives for it as a false flag just yet, but yeah, there&#39;s a lot not adding up about it and the fact that it was Novichok hasn&#39;t even been verified.  it&#39;s just government hearsay so far as usual.  and anyway, why would Russia use a nerve agent that would only have come from them, as if to leave it as a calling card if they were just going to deny their involvement in the attack? using a substance (or even just claiming the use of one) that&#39;s supposed to scream &quot;russia russia russia&quot; like the government is always doing, would make sense on the other hand as a government plot to frame its number one boogeyman of the minute.  history is replete with false flag ops of this exact nature used to demonize politically useful foreign enemies.</p>

<p>But both the &quot;Russian assassinations abroad&quot; and the &quot;vast pedophile network&quot; are concurrent conspiracies that have been going on for YEARS. The attempts to connect them, that one is a distraction from the other, is mostly an attempt to discredit one conspiracy by pivoting off the other. </p>

<p>They&#39;re both true, and happening. They shouldn&#39;t be made enemies of each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well i mean, we haven&#39;t seen any proof for at all.  just accusations.  and this russiagate thing has been dragging on like this for some time.  zero proof that russia was involved in anything at the state level.  and these indictments that keep getting passed off as &quot;proof&quot;.  12 twitter bots tweeting ridiculous memes on both sides of the debate having zero actual influence on the election results with zero conclusive evidence it had anything to do with the russian government? c&#39;mon people.  this is not what electoral interference by a foreign superpower looks like.  this is what war propaganda horse shit from the likes of people who have fed us that exact thing many times over in the past looks like.  for example, Mueller himself lied under oath that WMD&#39;s were being stockpiled by Iraq during the Bush era even tho the intelligence community at the time knew this was false.  this is what&#39;s happening again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their is a something to gain by attempting to posion a worthless ex double agent. One they could be making a statement to any future double agents, that eventually the state will get their revenge and that no where is safe. Second they can use it as propaganda to create an us vs them narrative in Russia by claiming that the west is attempting to blame innocent Russia and is attempting to punish Russia for something they didn&#39;t do. They do also have a lot to lose, but it is possible that Russia could have seen it as worth it. Now it is also completely plausible that someone else did the attack to frame Russia, or that the UK is assigning blame on Russia for political reasons when they may be unsure of the culprit. Really no way to truly know without more proof other than just the poison being originally created in Russia, as their are likely multiple groups who also have motive and may capable of pulling off the attack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every politician is a little magician, almost always acts as a verbal illusionist. There is an important rule for those who want to see through the focus: you need not look at the manipulation of the magician, but on what it distracts your attention from. Let&#39;s try to look at the current British internal political situation through the eyes of the British government. Immediately before the eyes there are several very serious problems and scandals with far-reaching consequences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the details of the crimes of the &quot;Telford pedophiles&quot;, which flowed into the media, the blood is getting cold: three victims were burned alive, several stabbed. And local officials preferred to ignore reports that they have a well-organized network selling minors, sex slaves. For completeness, it should be noted that the network of pedophiles was uncovered not by the police, but by journalists (!). And they complained many times that the authorities did everything to prevent them. In any country, this scandal should have been the main theme of the media for months and the main theme for political battles, but not in the UK. In England, the &quot;poisoning&quot; of Skripal happened very timely, almost all the system media &quot;took under the visor&quot; and switched the attention of the public. And if before the BBC was subjected to harsh criticism for the suspicious reluctance to pay due attention to the political cover of &quot;Telford pedophiles,&quot; now anyone who dares to recall the scandal will easily be accused of trying to divert public attention from the intrigues of the external enemy, that is Russia. From the point of view of political expediency, it would hardly be a pity to poison at least ten &quot;violins&quot; in order to get rid of the media and political nightmare that Teresa May was in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering trafficking and pimping children for sex is big business among the Russian oligarchy, which I have first hand knowledge of due to my involvement as counsel in several federal lawsuits and have seen the evidence, believe me or not, I don’t care, I don’t find it surprising at all that something like this would happen.  It could be that the issues are related, as posited by OP, or it could simply be that Putin’s continuing to clean up loose ends as Mueller’s noose continues to tighten on Trump and/or his associates and as Russia’s election draws near.</p>

<p>To be clear, I’m not saying the Brits or wealthy citizens aren’t guilty or aren’t involved in what broke earlier this week.  I simply haven’t had access to evidence in that regard.</p>

<p>go check the news papers or any speeches by May or Boris Johnson --- all they say is only &quot;developed by russia&quot;</p>
