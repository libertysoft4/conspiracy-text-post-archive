<p>Since Diabetes is primarily a pancreatic thing (I&#39;m pretty sure) one has to wonder why the pancreas appears to be such am elusive mistress in this age of medical science and &quot;free thought&quot;. Why is that a pancreas surgery or pancreas transplant is still not possible? Or presumably even nearly possible (edit: as a means to cure diabetes)? Medical science has yet to unravel a number of mysteries (the mechanism of action countless psychoactive medicines for instance, or how cats purr). Are we still unsure how the pancreas produces insulin and therefore unable to emulate or repair the task inside the human? Or do we understand the production and for some reason unable to emulate it. </p>

<p>What about the drug companies that produce insulin (and insulin accessories i.e., testing strips, or lancets, which are also pricey). Which companies make them? Which company created them? How many companies rely on diabetics as a primary profit generator? What companies are dependent on these companies? Are there still insulin patents that restrict generic production? What about Lancet patents? </p>

<p>What about rogue doctors? We see a number of these characters die or disappear under mysterious circumstances in anti-vaxx circles. Have there been any related to diabetes? And so forth </p>

<p>the cause of diabetes has been confused.  once you know the cause you know the cure.   but yes its such a big money maker they will try to hide this.</p>

<p>peace be with you</p>

<p>edit - intra cellular fat blocks sugar getting to the cells.. so you get blood sugar spikes and low energy.  get rid of the fat and the sugar can be absorbed.   diabetes mellitus  literally means sugar (honey) passes through.  because urine is very sugary.   so they blame the sugar but the real problem is fat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pancreas transplants are a thing, and often follow ups seem to indicate the amount of anti-rejection medicine that replaces your insulin is worse than the diabetes itself. We know reasonably well how to pancreas produces insulin and why. The reason we are unable to emulate it is because in Type 1 diabetes the cells which produce insulin are destroyed (according to theory). Also in theory we could implant stem cells which would be converted into these insulin producing islet cells ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_islets">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_islets</a> ).</p>

<p>As far as producers and manufacturers, there are relatively few and I totally believe their is some manipulation to maximize profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mother was diagnosed type 1 out of the blue at age 41. No family history, no nothing. She has struggled tremendously to keep her levels under control, which she finally had to go on an insulin pump that helped. It is a constant battle and a very expensive one at that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah my dad was diagnosed at 20 while in the navy, he passed out while working and they found out his blood sugar was at 900, he made it 36 years after. He also did not take care of himself and could not afford medical care, he was on insulin but the cheap kind, he made too much for free stuff and not enough for paying out of pocket. This country is a joke when it comes to medical costs and especially pharmaceutical costs, an IV bag that costs $25 to make &amp; ship ends up as $500 on your bill, I work in a hospital and the costs are ludicrous. Hope your mom lives past 100 my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s in reference to onset or type 2 diabetes which comes from a breakdown in pancreatic function. </p>

<p>Type 1, also known as childhood diabetes occurs for no known reason and they&#39;ve been unable to find a definitive link for it to be passed genetically, it makes you insulin dependent immediately and there is no cure. Most who have it are very skinny and unable to gain weight. My father died at 56 from complications due to it, likely heart failure, there are a ton of people working on a cure for that one as it has been killing children and adults for well over 100 years. As of yet there is no cure. I wish there was, maybe I would not have had to find my father&#39;s body if that was the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a type 1 insulin dependant diabetic for 26 years, you can&#39;t eat a diet and start producing insulin again. I was diagnosed at 15 months, and my pancreatic beta cells, which produce insulin, were destroyed. There is literally no way for a diet to change this. Telling people a diet can &quot;cure&quot; type 1 is misinformation. Sure,  diet will enable you to not have to take larger amounts of insulin, but you will still need to take it due to the fact that type 1 insulin dependant diabetics do not produce any insulin naturally on their own. </p>

<p>I also work as a paramedic, and the lack of education about the disease is pretty big, even among people that are diagnosed. It&#39;s a big reason as to why there are complications among those with this chronic illness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dad was told he could not have a pancreas transplant because there is no such thing and he was told that he couldn&#39;t live without it either. He is an insulin dependent diabetic and he has pancreatitis. I wish doctors could do something for him. He was told that his pancreas is already 3/4 th burned out. When it burns out all the way it will rot inside him and cause cancer killing him in a very painful way. He is already in pain from the pancreatitis itself. If the surgery is possible then why did the VA tell him it wasn&#39;t? They basically gave him a death sentence and tell him they can do nothing for him. </p>

<p>However, diabetes isn&#39;t a disease with an established etiology, and it has no root causal agent.</p>

<p>Why a person becomes diabetic seems to be related to genetic predisposition coupled with lifestyle choices. This cannot be undone by drugs or a phamaceutical regimen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their was some attempts by a local university to find a cure, and they recently came close. They created implants that contained stem cells that are supposed to last very long and basically would cure type 1 diabetes. After doing human trials they found that while it may work it was way worse than having diabetes as the implants would cause horrible pain until they were removed.</p>
