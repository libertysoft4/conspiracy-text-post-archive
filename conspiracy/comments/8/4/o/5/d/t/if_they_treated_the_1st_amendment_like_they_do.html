        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For too long we have had to live with religious violence: car bombings, the assassination of abortion doctors, planes being flown into buildings. Enough is enough. <strong>The right to religious freedom was dreamed up almost 250 years ago by a bunch of old, white, slave-owning men, and it really has no place in today&#39;s world</strong>. With modern technology and government safety nets, we have our basic needs taken care of, and the outdated right to religious freedom is simply holding us back. Politicians may be afraid to speak out against religious freedom, but it&#39;s time we took a stand.  </p>

<p>The numbers speak for themselves. Compare China, where there is little to no freedom of religion or religious violence, to the Middle East, where Jews and Muslims kill each other on a daily basis. Limiting religious freedom works, plain and simple. I&#39;d like to see all religion banned in America eventually, but in the meantime we need to at least adopt some common sense restrictions. For starters, let&#39;s <strong>ban high capacity churches</strong>. There&#39;s absolutely no reason to be preaching to hundreds or even thousands of people at a time in modern society. Soap boxes or, as I like to call them, <strong>assault podiums</strong>, need to be banned as well. These dangerous devices let just about anyone set up and preach religion right on our public streets. I see no problem with <strong>raising the age to practice religious freedom to 21</strong>, and we should also place <strong>a special tax on religious people</strong> to fund an education program about religious violence. Lastly, and this is something I think both sides can agree on, we should have <strong>mental health exams for anyone who wants to practice religious freedom</strong>. Religious people claim that they are mostly law-abiding citizens, but they all have the potential to become radicalized terrorists.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sick and tired of having to endure religious violence because of religious freedom advocates clinging to their gods to make up for their own insecurities. And I&#39;m sick of condescending religious freedom advocates <em>godsplaining</em> their beliefs to me and acting like I don&#39;t get a voice just because I don&#39;t know the technical difference between a Sunni and a Sufi. It&#39;s more than enough to know that they basically all worship cows and put their gods&#39; laws before the laws of man. <strong>The founding fathers could never have imagined the religious diversity that we have today in America</strong>. If they had they would have never written the first amendment, because we can clearly see that mixing all these different ideologies together is a recipe for disaster.  </p>

<p>Religious freedom might exist as a right for now, but we also have a right to feel safe from religious violence. <strong>If placing restrictions on religious freedom saves even one life, then it&#39;s worth it</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that case was partially overturned, leaving the Espionage Act mostly intact, but it is the most famous case and the place where speech was first determined to be restricted.</p>

<p>My overall point, that free speech is restricted stands.</p>

<p>For example, in 2010, on the very last day of the same term where the 5-4 <em>Citizens United</em> decision came down, a 6-3 Republicans-Democrats decision came down making it a fe3deral crime to try to counsel so-called terrorists to give up terror. </p>

<p>Well, of course not. That&#39;s not the point of my initial comment, nor was it my point that the exact and particular details of the original theater fire case were fully intact exactly as they appeared nearly 100 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are just looking to argue reflexively against someone who merely points out that the First Amendment is in fact heavily damaged, a point that the submission appears to reject. </p>

<p>I did not claim that the &quot;fire&quot; case was fully intact.</p>

<p>I did not claim that the case was not partially overturned. You did, and you overstated the situation.</p>

<p>I merely claimed that the First Amendment has been restricted, and partially in a different way than might be expected. </p>

<p>I did not say that one restriction justifies another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. Personally, I&#39;m fine with taking a gun safety course to get a CCW (although that could be abused as well). But that&#39;s not what&#39;s going on in a lot of places. In some cities, including the one I live in, you cannot get a CCW except under extremely limited circumstances. One of the &quot;needed requirements&quot; is getting special permission from the local sheriff.</p>

The way it works is citizens have freedom of religion so that the govt. has freedom FROM religion. SEPARATION OF CHURCH and state is one of the most important pillars of our nation.

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s not limit it to religion, either. That entire first amendment needs to go. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For too long we have had to live with harmful words: Swearing, offensive content, unpopular opinions, inciting violence. Enough is enough. The right to speak was dreamed up almost 250 years ago by a bunch of old, white, slave-owning men, and it really has no place in today&#39;s world. With modern technology and government safety nets, we have our basic needs taken care of, and the outdated right to speak or petition the government is simply holding us back. Politicians may be afraid to speak out against free speech, but it&#39;s time we took a stand.</p>

<p>The numbers speak for themselves. Compare China, where there is little to no freedom of speech or protests, to United States, where people who have opinions kill each other on a daily basis. Limiting the public&#39;s right to speak out or petition the government works, plain and simple. I&#39;d like to see all dissent banned in America eventually, but in the meantime we need to at least adopt some common sense restrictions. For starters, let&#39;s ban Nazis and pedophiles. There&#39;s absolutely no reason to be agreeing with evil people in modern society. Soap boxes or, as I like to call them, assault podiums, need to be banned as well. These dangerous devices let just about anyone set up and speak right on our public streets. I see no problem with raising the age to speak out to 21, and we should also place a special tax on licenses to rent out public spaces to fund an education program about disagreeing with the majority. Lastly, and this is something I think both sides can agree on, we should have mental health exams for anyone who wants to express an opinion. People who try to express their beliefs claim that they are mostly law-abiding citizens, but they all have the potential to become radicalized terrorists.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sick and tired of having to endure hearing people I disagree with because of free speech advocates clinging to their words to make up for their own insecurities. And I&#39;m sick of condescending speakers explaining their beliefs to me. The founding fathers could never have imagined the diversity that we have today in America. If they had they would have never written the first amendment, because we can clearly see that mixing all these different ideologies together is a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>Freedom of speech might exist as a right for now, but we also have a right to feel safe from things we find offensive or disagree with. If placing restrictions on speech saves even one life, then it&#39;s worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol You’ve described a totalitarian dystopia. Also I’m pretty sure nazis and pedophiles are already banned. You seem very confused. The insecure don’t speak out. The insecure are tired of having to endure people they disagree with speak out. I disagree with you but I have absolutely no issue with you expressing your opinion. More diversity means more disagreement which is why free speech is so crucial. We need to agree to disagree, not agree to strip the rights of anyone we disagree with. We all disagree on some level because we’re all different. We each belong to multiple identity groups which is why collectivism just doesn’t work. Now let’s have a discussion instead of a down-voting war </p>
