<p>A CIA run Government is as wrong as a Military run Government or equal to the same type of Government that led Nazi Germany. The CIA doesn&#39;t have a great history of looking after the best interest of the citizens as it does looking after it&#39;s own psychopathic interest in the name of national security, to run the government with complete control over the masses with CIA controlled multi media outlets. The result of a bunch of psychopaths running the most powerful country in the world doesn&#39;t end well for anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We learn before kindergarten that all people are unique and different.  The &quot;both parties&quot; contain people. Each and every one of those people are unique and different in so many ways. But somehow, geniuses can take all of these infinite differences between each and every one of these people, weigh them out, and balance them -- only to find the impossible -- that both parties are &quot;the same.&quot; Then, you wonder why people don&#39;t take you seriously.</p>

<p>To prove that both parties are not the same, all I need is one difference. War is a good example. Republicans wrote up a plan to attack Iran. They were ready to do it until 2007 when Democrats took the Congress and warned them to stop. Later, during the Obama administration, a convention was reached with Iran and other nations to bring a long-term peace. That very peace is being undermined by the current Republican administration as the drumbeat to war against Iran resumes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vast, vast majority of CIA folks aren&#39;t in operations, they&#39;re analysts.  Their job is to review intelligence and public sources and create assessments of foreign behavior and intentions.  These are research and writing jobs, almost academic, and the CIA tends to recruit for them from America&#39;s top universities.  Those people tend to lean liberal and Democratic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of Trump it is projected that there are going to be BIG gains by Democrats in the House and Senate this election cycle. The CIA knows this and they are running as Democrats because the Democrats are the party that is going to win a bunch of seats, and possibly take control of the House and Senate in this election cycle.</p>

<p>The are simply taking advantage of the political climate which gives Democrats a huge advantage in this election cycle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ts not pro-conservative anything, just obvious, unbiased analysis of what the current political climate is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually a pattern that repeats over and over again. A President of one of the political parties gains the presidency and in the next election cycle congressional control goes to the party opposing the president. This is part of the illusion of democracy that we have, it is also a convenient strategy to get nothing done and maintain the status quo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The foundations of the Democrat party are big government and more laws. The foundation of the Republican party are smaller federal government, more states rights and fewer laws/restrictions.</p>

<p>We know the schools and media lean left as well.</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s the game plan appears to be to 1) make  the democrat stance more socially popular and 2) control the democrat party.</p>

<p>That&#39;s said, they are in both side. Number 1 RINO is John  McCain, who by his actions, appears to be a Democrat and deep state plant. But they are vastly more in twined with the Dems. </p>
