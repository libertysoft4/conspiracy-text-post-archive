What gives? It&#39;s not normal for members of this side to bandwagon onto one side of a political issue. This doesn&#39;t seem organic at all. </p>

<p>As an example, see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8443cc/tillerson_says_exspys_poisoning_in_uk_clearly/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8443cc/tillerson_says_exspys_poisoning_in_uk_clearly/</a></p>

<p>Comment stating &quot;It&#39;s pretty obvious that Russia has something on Trump&quot; gets 50 upvotes. Those offering an opposite/alternative perspective get bombed with downvotes. This pattern is repeated over and over in Russia-centered posts on this sub and many others. </p>

<p>I still believe most organic /conspiracy sub followers are genuine, skeptical free-thinkers. The anti-Russia bandwaggoning reeks of shilling/brigading. This sub is under major attack and the goal is to maximize fear and suspicion toward Russia and Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. I really dislike the term “free thinker”. In my opinion, it’s too often used to imply “I’m right and you’re wrong” or to suggest that someone is dumb or uninformed. I’m not sure if that’s what OP meant, at least that’s not what I got out of it, but I see his point and we have certainly been under constant pressure to push that story down our throats.

So they manufacture consent as you said. It&#39;s really fucking depressing to watch this in slow motion and not be able to do anything about it.

    <div class="md"><p>You said it in the title: shilling.</p>

<p>There are lots of pro-Establishment shills here, and they use votebots. They don&#39;t want you criticizing the Russia narrative, and they don&#39;t want you to discuss any conspiracy that potentially makes their handlers look bad (ie. Pizza/Pedogate, Seth Rich, Uranium-1, etc.) Its very obvious, and the best solution I&#39;ve found is to just block all of them.</p>

It also gives the establishment overlords the excuse they needed to clamp down on internet freedom of information, social media censorship etc... which is something they wanted to do anyway.

I would be willing to bet you don&#39;t need to look through a folder of evidence to get behind at least a few of those theories. There is an on going investigation right now. When it&#39;s over, they will show us what they found. Maybe he didn&#39;t collude with them. But he sure was a useful idiot for them. Considering he hired all these people actively lobbying for Russian interests. Why don&#39;t we just see what Mueller says when the investigation is over? And we can speculate till that happens.

<p>It&#39;s interesting to say the least. But honestly, if at this point you&#39;re still claiming &quot;no evidence&quot;, I doubt you&#39;re interested in learning what&#39;s actually out there.

    <div class="md"><p>Nah. Benghazi was a witch hunt- multiple millions spent over multiple years, with nothing to show for it. Starr&#39;s investigation into Bill Clinton was a witch hunt- it started out as a real estate investment investigation, but he was eventually impeached for lying about a <em>blow job</em>.</p>

<p>In comparison, Mueller&#39;s investigation of Trump has been remarkably laser-focused, and has already resulted in multiple indictments over a <em>very</em> short period of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, this just doesn&#39;t match reality. Oil/gas prices have been rising most of Trump&#39;s presidency. That&#39;s good for Russia, whereas the proliferation of fracking and natural gas discoveries under Obama were driving prices down, which was bad for Russia.</p>

<p>Trump has also attacked pretty much all of America&#39;s allies and called NATO obsolete. The same guy who picks petty fights with everyone -- actresses, department stores, pro athletes, members of his own party, etc. -- won&#39;t say ONE WORD against Putin, and even threw his own country under the bus when asked to address Russian human rights abuses.</p>

<p>Trump also refuses to enforce sanctions against Russia despite being forced to sign the law himself after a veto-proof bipartisan majority voted for new sanctions. It has also been reported that he attempted to lift other sanctions against Russia as soon as he entered office.</p>

<p>Then there was the time he passed code-word intelligence to the Russians in the Oval Office (in a meeting where US press was banned, but Russian TASS photographers were allowed) and likely burned an Israeli asset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>-Oil prices are extremely low compared to most of the years Obama was President. They are only up now because of OPEC cuts which are in response to American energy production that Trump is a proponent of. Fracking and natural gas discoveries happened in spite of Obama. The Democrats ran against the continuation of this phenomonen. They  want to go back to $100/barrel oil in order to speed up green technology, urbanization, and fewer carbon emissions. </p>

<p>-NATO is obsolete. The Cold War is over. Why do Americans need to be the everlasting shield for Western European partners who have been spared  high military budgets. Why do we need to fight Russia when our 21st Century rival is clearly China? </p>

<p>Sanctions lead to animosity and war. They don&#39;t work. They didn&#39;t make Saddam or Kim Jong Un good guys. You can&#39;t have it both ways with us being World Policeman and not when it suits your politics. Russia needs to be checked but not at the risk of another expensive Cold War.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m tagging lots of them.  I guess it&#39;s a glass 1/2 full or glass 1/2 empty kind of thing.   And the big upvotes for &quot;Russia burnt my toast&quot; people are disturbing.  On a superficial level, votes don&#39;t matter -- but it&#39;s what they indicate to me, on <em>this</em> sub, that bothers me.<br/>
But, I do like your optimistic attitude.  It inspires perseverance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly why I haven&#39;t been here as much recently. It certainly seems worse right now, and I hope it&#39;s because of the whole Tillerson thing. They must sense an opportunity with that ridiculous timing of getting fired plus Russia assassin? Surely there are other important reasons why Tillerson was fired. The lack of analysis by the corporate media is damning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know collusion is the biggest buzzword for the right. It&#39;s everything they want to prove wrong. Well, I have a video of Trump telling someone in an interview in 2013 that he has a relationship with Putin. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll find &quot;collusion&quot;. If anything I&#39;d imagine it would be be a &quot;Hey Donnie, you friend of Russia, you run for president we got your back&quot; but you know, in Russian and they leave it at that. </p>

<p>Otherwise the big claim is on who stole the DNC emails. Republicans push that it was Seth Rich. Everyone else understands that if it is true that Russian agents gained access to the DNCCC emails then that would be foreign intervention into an election for President of the U.S. </p>

<p>Something too spicy for fragile snowflakes to fathom. I hope China hacks the Republicans for talking shit to them. I won&#39;t say a word. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, just keep kicking around controversial, it&#39;s where I found your post just now. The absurd brigading can only last so long as the paper-thin narrative they parrot does. Endure for now and chuckle at the ham-fisted &quot;hello fellow conspiracy believers&quot; bullshit. Like that 9/11 facebook meme at 1.4k upvotes on the front page. The title of that thing is </p>

<p>Saw this and was amazed. Is this information completely factual? If so, this should be a redpill for the masses.</p>
