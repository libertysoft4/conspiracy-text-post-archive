        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">518</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-03-16 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/axolotl_peyotl.html">axolotl_peyotl</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I wasn&#39;t around for Vietnam (it&#39;s <em>insane</em> to me that they got away with that unfathomably stupid war), but I vividly recall during the build up to the Iraq war that questioning that decision was akin to &quot;not supporting the troops.&quot;</p>

<p>This logical fallacy may seem obvious now, but at the time it felt like 9/11 and the subsequent propaganda narrative suspended all rational thought. </p>

<p>After Obama&#39;s election, I soon realized that these narratives were being created by and for the pathetic world of partisan hackery. Because of these MSM-pushed narratives, by questioning the Iraq War I was labelled as a &quot;crazy leftist&quot; and by questioning Obama&#39;s drone wars and insane actions in Libya somehow made me a &quot;crazy right winger.&quot;</p>

<p>The similarities between Bush and Obama were so striking that it proved to be a massive wake up call for many with respect to how both major parties are bought and paid for by the military industrial complex.</p>

<p>And now we get to Russiagate. I remember as a kid learning about the Red Scare/Cold War and simply marveling at how an entire generation could be raised in fear. That generation is still &quot;in control&quot; and this fear-based mindset has shaped the world&#39;s foreign policies for decades.</p>

<p>With 9/11, they&#39;re trying again, this time raising a generation with &quot;Fear 2.0.&quot;</p>

<p>However, technology/the internet is responsible for waking up a significant portion of the younger generations, so now they&#39;ve set their sites on the internet itself by lumping it, in its entirety, with their &quot;fake news&quot; xenophobic memes.</p>

<p>Is Russia a thuggish mafia state that executes dissidents? Probably.</p>

<p>Are politicians/elites all connected to each other via shady business/criminal dealings that span generations? Almost certainly.</p>

<p>Does this mean we should allow ourselves to be whipped into a frenzy enough to embrace a global conflict, especially at the prodding of the same institutions that have blatantly lied to us before, at the cost of <em>great</em> human suffering?</p>

<p>I say: Absolutely not.</p>

<p>But, from my limited knowledge, I think one of the reasons they say they want to go to war with Iran is because they say that Iran is big state funder of terrorism around the world. I think some of that is true, but I don&#39;t know to what extent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It always comes down to resources we can plunder or economic competitors we can decimate. In the case of Iran, I assume it&#39;s about regional control of resources (oil). It&#39;s never <em>really</em> about terrorism. If it was, Saudi Arabia would have been in our crosshairs a long time ago. They transparently fund terrorism, whereas Iran&#39;s connections have always been murky and subject to the biases of the storyteller.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The next great war will take place in the EU following the economic collapse that will inevitably take place there.  The dwindling native  population of several countries in the area have created a massive imbalance between tax payers and those consuming social services.  </p>

<p>The UN&#39;s plan to bring in new blood and to transform these immigrants and their children into law-abiding tax paying citizens has been met with resistance and unanticipated costs that substantially dwarf those estimated.   These challenges will ultimately prevent these failing states from saving themselves economically.  </p>

<p>In an effort to survive, half of the continent will push for a stronger EU with more centralized totalitarian economic control over its states and half of the countries will seek independence.  As the survival of each of these countries will depend on the outcome, no amiable resolution will be available to parties.  The continent will collapse into a violent civil war as millions.  </p>

<p>The United States will send &quot;peace keeping&quot; troops to the continent and station a massive amount of troops in the UK.  China&#39;s economy will be strengthened.   China will desire to continue trading with anyone they wish while the US will attempt to stop all trade between the half of Europe supporting the EU and the rest of the world.  This will escalate a trade war between China and the US and it will appear in the media as though China and the US are dangerously close to war, though both countries will avoid direct military conflict with one another.  </p>

<p>The US will ultimately spend trillions of dollars, once again, cleaning up after those who fail to learn from history and continue to pursue socialist and communist policies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he&#39;s referring to the issues you get with an aging population and pensions. Australia (where I live) has identified this as a key problem we&#39;re going to face going forward.</p>

<p>The problem boils down to &quot;We used to retire at 65 and live till 80, now we retire at 65 and live to 90&quot;. That means you need a larger tax-base to pay for it (which is where the ponzi scheme portion comes in), or you need to cut pensions. Pensions is political suicide, so you go the other way. Young people have fewer children (for professional reasons, wider availability of contraceptives, whatever), so you need to augment population growth with immigration.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/populationpuzzle/">This</a> is an old-ish documentary on the subject (the whole lot is on youtube, but it&#39;s kind of useless - it mostly asks questions then abruptly ends).</p>

<p>FWIW I don&#39;t think this is a ponzi scheme, and that governments will find other ways to adjust (potentially with a sensible immigration policy involved), but that is a popular-ish mode of thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. Germany has been driving a lot of the EU economic power these days, and because of this they have a lot of political power. Makes sense this is what Nazi Germany planned for... They funneled out gold and over $500m of it was never recovered. Many believe this money was used both to bolster industrial Germany after the war and also to start the European Economic Commission (which would later become the EU and whose first president was one of the Nazi party&#39;s top economists. </p>

<p>The Nazi party actions regarding this theory that are provable were specifically to make sure that if the region fell apart again, Germany&#39;s industry and banks would remain strong. </p>

<p>As for whether or not there&#39;s a Nazi conspiracy mixed up in there, it doesn&#39;t matter. The facts are that the money went missing and the EEC (and its modern form, the EU) was actually part of the Nazi party&#39;s defeat plan.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just for the record...</p>

<p>the critical financial difficulties the EU is now having and any economic collapse if it comes will be as the direct result of Wall Street having trading worthless sub-prime mortgage derivatives into the European banking system as valuable assets that those banks then proceeded to issue all kinds of loans with those assets to back them up. </p>

<p>Loans that were also and actually worthless as a result with no way to legally resolve that in keeping with the good faith that those loans were issued. </p>

<p>When the true nature of those toxic assets that nobody could possibly collect on and the loans that had been issued off the back of them finally came to light Europe quite literally lost half of it&#39;s value on paper overnight and has been forced to struggle with the reality of that ever since. That is also what has placed Italy, Greece, Spain, and Portugal in such dire straits with not much in the way of any real help for them.</p>

<p>The fact that the US government deliberately allowed those sub-prime mortgages to be issued, knowing that the vast majority of them could only fall into default and Wall St. to knowingly bundle them up into worthless derivatives and trade them into the European banking system without any criminal charges or penalties ever being brought against those responsible for committing that enormous and outrageous financial fraud, only proves that the US government fully intended and wanted to collapse the Euro and show the European nations who their real boss happens to be. </p>

<p>Now if you can&#39;t raise the value of your own currency in competition against one that is steadily growing stronger and more desirable than your own on the world market then the only alternative is to find some means to weaken and devalue theirs and sabotage the economy that gave it that strength at the same time, and as illegal and reprehensible as that was, it was precisely what the US government did. </p>

<p>It was also intended to intimidate and keep the European nations in line with US ambitions in Europe and beyond <em>if they know what&#39;s good for them</em> and to firm-up their support for the US run protection racket that&#39;s called NATO without any further complaints or foot dragging.</p>

<p>As I look around all I see are a long series of messes and human degradation that the US has deliberately created by surreptitiously intervening in the political affairs of other nations in order to put compliant puppet regimes and even ruthless dictators on the US payroll to run them in order to have them sign over over their nation&#39;s resources and their own people into indentured servitude to major US corporations that will move in and fully exploit them and those resources for a mere fraction of their real worth and pocket the difference. </p>

<p>If that doesn&#39;t work then a military incursion whose main purpose is to utterly destroy those countries infrastructure and bring them to their knees is the next step. Once that&#39;s done whoever is left in charge will have no choice but to sign over their most valuable resources or assets to major US corporations out of sheer desperation and for a mere pittance and a promise that some help will eventually be forthcoming if they co-operate with that.</p>

<p>The simple fact of the matter is that the US is automatically at war with any country that attempts to pursue any form of socialist or egalitarian economic policies from the very moment any of them make a move in that direction, whether it&#39;s democratically arrived at and the wish of the majority of their people or not and they will go on the US hit list or simply on it&#39;s shit list depending on how serious the US happens to view any of those moves. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because the possibility of them succeeding and encouraging any others to follow suit has to be contained and snuffed-out by any and all means and no means are out of bounds or off limits no matter how reprehensible they are or what any of the human consequences those actions will have on any of the citizens of those nations. </p>

<p>So the degree of difficulty in having any succeed with all the political, economic and military power US pits against and constantly undermines them with, needs to be seen for what it is when it comes to how and why any actually fail and fall from grace from honest and hopeful beginnings, and it is rarely through any fault of their own, nor any real surprise when they do given the role that always plays in them.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t ever kid yourself about the US always being the &quot;good guys&quot; and saviors of the world, it&#39;s never been more than a phoney Hollywood myth that no one on the planet except ordinary Americans have been cajoled and inculcated to believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two points.</p>

<p>1) This was in response to the violent revolutions and neo-nazi militias funded by Western NGOs. This is a fact.</p>

<p>2) Crimea actually voted to join them. <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2016/02/11/how-crimeans-see-ukraine-crisis/">This is backed by various independent polls.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Pew poll from April 2014 revealed that 91 percent of Crimean respondents believed the referendum was free and fair, 93 percent had confidence in Putin, and 85 percent believed Kiev should recognize the results.</p>

<p>Another poll in June 2014, this one from Gallup, showed 94 percent of ethnic Russians in Crimea thought the referendum reflected the views of the people and 68 percent of ethnic Ukrainians in Crimea agreed. The poll found that 74 percent believed that joining Russia would make life better.</p>

<p>A GfK poll from February 2015, sponsored by a pro-Ukrainian group in Canada, revealed 93 percent of Crimeans endorsed the referendum.</p>

<p>The Crimean Tatars, an ethnic minority comprising approximately 12 percent of the population, is divided on reunification. Surveys reflecting the view of Crimean Tatars specifically, or which break down opinion by ethnicity to include the Tatars, are difficult to find. Russian media has reported that 30 percent of Crimean Tatars voted in favor of reunification but it is unclear where this figure originates from.</p>

<p>One survey conducted jointly by Open Democracy and the Levada Center, published in March of 2015, did include Tatar opinion. Their results revealed that 50 percent of Crimean Tatars supported the referendum (30 percent generally and 20 percent absolutely) while 30 percent opposed it and 20 percent did not express support or opposition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So again, OP isnt incorrect in this regard. I&#39;m really tired of people spouting the invasions as talking points because the <strong>West is the aggressor in all of these situations.</strong> This constant black-white rhetoric which ignores all context and relevant facts (from both sides, East and West) is <em>really</em> getting tiring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is it&#39;s because equating this whole Russia mess to the Iraq war and Obama&#39;s actions in Libya is kind of a stretch. The first two scenarios were military campaigns as usual pushed by each administration and Trump&#39;s Russia is something totally being 100% denied by the current administration. Kind of makes no sense to equate them all. Especially since we aren&#39;t yet at war with Russia. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what will happen</p>

<p>Anyone who&#39;s done enough research and have actually read the Manafort indictments and researched to understand what they mean would know Mueller is not interested in Trump. He&#39;s a great actor.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how it works. Besides Trump already fucked himself by firing Comey and trying to obstruct the investigation into Michael Flynn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>to respond to your post honestly, I truly believe trump did something wrong. But, I trust the Mueller investigation. If he finishes, and has the indictment and charges against manafort, flynn, maybe some other high ranking officials, but says we just could not find anything against trump, I will be extremely skeptical, but I would take it for his word. It doesn&#39;t mean I would agree with trumps policies or cabinet picks any more, but i would buy that instead of being bought and paid for by Russia, he just really seems to like maniacal authoritarians like duterte and xi</p>

<p>And it wasn&#39;t all of Ukraine...Crimea is historically part of Russia and the site of a Russian base. What if another country came into Cuba and decided to kick us out of Guantanamo?

<p>I&#39;m not saying Russia is some pinnacle of virtue, but I&#39;ll argue all day long that they have nothing on us as far as crimes against humanity. We are not the good guys and we haven&#39;t been for a long time. We create conflict for profit and to justify our massive military budget. We torture, assassinate, imprison without trial, drone bomb innocents, overthrow countries and basically leave a swathe of chaos and misery everywhere we touch. Name one country that&#39;s better off since we came to &#39;help&#39; them.  In the meantime our own country is crumbling around us. We slip further and further down the ranks as far as infrastructure, education, medical care, but God forbid we could go a fucking year without being involved in a half a dozen different conflicts around the globe, spreading our version of &#39;peace and democracy&#39; whether they like it or not and spending trillions in the process.  And Putin is the bad guy? Take a look at your own fucking country and the war crimes of every single one of the last six presidents. </p>

<p>Because FOX says it isn&#39;t true, it is? That&#39;s as bad as saying anything the MSM puts out is false. And it&#39;s not just FOX. Respected journalists, commentators, and whistle-blowers have called this investigation a sham. This includes Chomsky, Greenwald, Sibel Edmonds, Robert Parry, etc. Yeah, Russians try to interfere, as does every country, but there is still absolutely no evidence they had any meaningful impact.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean Trump and co. are not laundering money and are overall financially compromised; they most certainly are. The investigators themselves are guilty of the same crimes, and the Special Prosecutor is a giant piece of shit who has covered for the Deep State&#39;s crimes (9/11, illegal FBI searches, IRA scandal, etc). </p>

<p>And these new sanctions do nothing but hurt Europe, since they are dependent on Russian oil and gas. <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/unintended-consequences-us-sanctions/230503/">These sanctions would force them to rely on the more expensive American oil/gas.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Already, Europe is panicking over the idea that countries like Germany might have to purchase expensive American Liquefied Natural Gas which then has to be painstakingly shipped to Europe rather than the cheap and comparatively local alternative of Russian pipeline gas.</p>

<p>Russia could, therefore, tempt Europe with the carrot of cheap energy and goods while combining it with the stick of demanding Europe drop its own sanctions against Russia, most of which date back to 2014. Russia already has sympathetic ears in southern Europe on this matter and Germany may well be moving in this direction due to America’s blatant disregard for northern European concerns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So while the story has <em>some</em> validity, it is nothing but a distraction to the actual factions which dominate our electoral system and government, such as the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p>The same MSM shitting themselves about Russia has <em>never</em> talked about the CFR&#39;s influence. Do you not find that insane?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s not my fault the conspiracy I believe is perpetrated by idiots and has come to light more than other conspiracies. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that&#39;s blatantly false, since there are many, many conspiracies with far more evidence than Manchurian Candidate/Russian Hacking/Meddling/Collusion/Whatever the new term is as goalposts move, e.g false flags (Operation Gladio), the White Helmets being a propaganda construct, the New World Order, Operation Mockingbird, MK Ultra, elite pedophile rings, and many more.</p>

<p>But I do feel your pain, many conspiracies get discredited because vocal idiots do an awful job of representing them.</p>

<p>Problem is, there has already been quite a few headlines that have been redacted silently. This is the definition of manufacturing consent. If you recall, they did the exact same thing during the Libyan War - they plastered Gadaffi &quot;rape squads&quot; all over the front pages, then quietly retracted it once people realized it was a blatant lie. This is just an example out of many, of course.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a fair question. If you read articles from those who are openly critical of this Russiagate nonsense - Greenwald and Edmonds as examples - they don&#39;t discredit it because the MSM is pushing it. They do so because the narrative of &quot;collusion&quot; is based on very flimsy evidence pushed by extremely untrustworthy sources, and the investigation itself is headed by corrupt individuals (Mueller has covered for 9/11, IRA scandals, illegal FBI searches, etc.). That, and blatant propaganda sites like Hamilton 68 (created by Neocon thinktanks and spooks) are being pushed by these MSM outlets as more &quot;proof&quot; of &quot;meddling.&quot; This should alarm you greatly.</p>

<p>FOX is doing what FOX does - hyper-partisan GOP apologism.</p>

I would disagree the evidence for (at the least attempted) collusion is flimsy, but that is a fair argument to have as well. I personally don’t think anyone from Russia ever colluded with Trump personally, but I do think members of his campaign were approached and in some cases reached out to Russian intermediaries for help on dirt on Clinton and Trump was aware of it. And I think he knows there are financial crimes in his past involving Russian money and feels it is in his best interest to try to keep the Russian sanctions from hurting his business there. </p>

<p>Edit. Thanks for the discussion and opportunity to clarify my points in a cordial manner. My response was pretty defensive and I appreciate you looking past that to clarify your stance. </p>

<p>Russian police have reportedly arrested a man who has claimed to be a worker at a so-called troll factory in St. Petersburg, Russia, hours after he gave interviews to foreign journalists and lifted the lid on a secretive organization the U.S. Department of Justice last week accused of trying to undermine the 2016 presidential election.</p>

As if anyone who has followed the news on this story didn&#39;t know how Russia has interfered with the election. If you want to dispute the evidence and claims presented by Mueller&#39;s indictment of those 13 Russians and the IRA and numerous other evidence and claims presented by the Intelligence Community&#39;s reports and media&#39;s, go right ahead, but don&#39;t come here trolling me with a stupid question and deny you are a troll lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just from the absolute most basic start, before any actual election voting happened, Russia was found to have hacked the DNC.  They then released contextless emails in a manner designed to disrupt the US election cycle, specifically attempting to make the Democrats look bad, which DIRECTLY helps Trump.  This has been admitted by literally every major player in this, Republicans, Democrats, Trump, Obama, you fucking name it, they have admitted it, and it&#39;s interference.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even have to get into any nebulous &quot;facebook ads&quot; shit that you&#39;re so salivating at, this is concrete meddling and you absolutely can&#39;t deny it or you&#39;re a troll, plain and simple.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, not a troll.</p>

<p>Second, the claim that the contents of the DNC server were LEAKED, not hacked, is spurious at best. The MSM doesn&#39;t seem to want to talk about this, but here you go.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/a-new-report-raises-big-questions-about-last-years-dnc-hack/">Many very legitimate people</a> in the <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/07/24/intel-vets-challenge-russia-hack-evidence/">intelligence community</a> have spoken about the evidence proving this. The download time recorded was way, way too fast to have been anything other than a physical drive download on the premises. Inside job. The DNC wouldn&#39;t even allow the FBI to examine the servers. What does that tell you about the veracity of their claim that it was hacked by Russian state actors?</p>

<p>Wikileaks released the emails. They have repeatedly stated that the source was not a Russian, and in fact have hinted multiple times that it was a whistleblower from within the DNC themselves.</p>

<p>On another note, the US intereferes with every single election on the globe in one way or another. Russia didn&#39;t cause Hillary to lose. She lost because she was a deeply unpopular candidate who completely underestimated the other deeply unpopular candidate. There are a lot of reasons why she lost. But Russia &#39;interfering&#39; is not one of them.</p>

<p>Russia did not hack the DNC. Look beyond the MSM for your information, my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It still isn&#39;t clear to me why Julian Assange would be involved in hurting Clinton during the election. Not that Clinton was a great candidate, but why against Clinton and not both Parties. I don&#39;t quite understand why Assange seemingly wanted to help Trump win - I know he has stated that this wasn&#39;t his intention, but I don&#39;t really buy it at this point. </p>

<p>A lot of the Wikileaks leaks were from institutions that the Republican party historically is more connected to/has more interest in, like the US military, financial institutions, surveillance programs created under GWB, etc. so it&#39;s not clear from Assange&#39;s history that he has a Republican bias.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>My father was a moderate conservative with socially liberal views and after 9/11 he was putting American flags on his car and talking about killing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In those days, lots of cars had external antennas. It seemed like 90 percent of them were flying Chinese made American flags. It worked very well.</p>

<p>In 2016, the trick is to pretend that born wealthy Donald Trump is an outsider, and disgruntled Americans fell for it in large numbers. Even though it is so overwhelmingly clear that Donald Trump is pure establishment with a bad mouth, not enough people have awakened to the reality. We were fooled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It became obvious after the Cold War that the Soviet Union was painted over rust.
But they were very useful to justify a military budget so damn high.  We have been spending the same inflated amount of money (approx $600 billion a year) as we did during the Regan years.  </p>

<p>We destroyed Iraq because we know they were running around with WMDs, and Afghanistan?  That was a cake walk but we just cant kill enough of those Jihadis living on dirt floors and after 17 years its hard to justify spending all that stupid money on them.  So lets start pointing fingers at Russia again, provoke them, because that is real smart is to be start messing around on their front yard when they keep a bunch of  Nukes in the back yard.</p>

<p>Because past performance always guarantees future success. That&#39;s always the worst strategy for investing and gambling in Las Vegas.  But lets forget about that with our Military Strategic planning and diplomacy.</p>

I agree that Russia is definitely doing shady shit (as the US surely is) but global conflict is moronic and not the answer, however I don&#39;t think anyone wants that. Proxy wars are one thing but conflicts between major world powers $$$$$$$ too much. If things didn&#39;t reach that point during the Cold War, I doubt they will now. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Being around him really made me contemplate the relationship between the US and China. We have this &quot;us vs them&quot; mentally. But... normal citizens don&#39;t have a problem with people from other countries. People in power create the &quot;us vs them&quot; mentally. We&#39;re told other countries are our enemies, but their not really our enemies. They&#39;re just people like us. It&#39;s really messed up the tension between countries is caused by a few people and we pretty much fall in line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your first two terms are vague, probably intentionally, so that no matter what I post you can say....not big enough, or not reputable enough.  That said, this study from back in 2012 was done at Harvard University:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Findings from our meta-analyses of 27 studies published over 22 years suggest an inverse association between high fluoride exposure and children’s intelligence. <strong>Children who lived in areas with high fluoride exposure had lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-exposure or control areas.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>more:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reported effects of fluoride on your brain include:</p>

<p>• Reduction in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors</p>

<p>• Damage to your hippocampus</p>

<p>• Formation of beta-amyloid plaques (the classic brain abnormality in Alzheimer’s disease)</p>

<p>• Reduction in lipid content</p>

<p>• Damage to purkinje cells</p>

<p>• Exacerbation of lesions induced by iodine deficiency</p>

<p>• Impaired antioxidant defense systems</p>

<p>• Increased uptake of aluminum</p>

<p>• Accumulation of fluoride in your pineal gland</p>

<p>In the Brief Review of the link one question arises immediately for me. They reference in vitro exposure two relatively high levels of sodium fluoride.

    <div class="md"><p>You shouldn&#39;t. All of this Russia hysteria is a distraction away from the Democratic Party&#39;s complete failure during the 2016 election.</p>

<p>Instead of doing an honest postmortem on how they were defeated by a incredibly unpopular candidate (hint: it was and continues to be the fact that they offer zero real alternative to the Republican party and are in fact the same party answering to the same corporate oligarchs), they are fomenting war with a nuclear power.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the same people screaming about how dangerous Trump is just voted to give him another $80+ billion for the military without so much as a peep.</p>

<p>Russia is a boogeyman and the people in this thread are lapping up the BS that Fox News or MSNBC or pretty much any of the corporate-owned media is spewing out.</p>

<p>Fun fact: Russia&#39;s military budget is $46 billion. The United States? $611 billion. Their economy is roughly the size of Italy. They are not a communist country. They do not have a single military base outside of their borders. The US? 800 bases on foreign soil.</p>

<p>Is Putin a good dude? Absolutely not. But he and his country are not the ones running around the world bombing people and funding terrorism. That is the United States. And without another Osama Bin Laden-like villian for which to justify the astronomical defense budgets (that no politician seems to say &#39;no&#39; to), the Establishment needs an enemy.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that at some point, this bullshit is going to turn hot and we will have poked a NUCLEAR superpower too many times. And then what? We all lose.</p>

<p>I am not Russian. I am American. I consider myself politically progressive. I am 100% all in on diplomacy over unfounded accusations made by an Establishment that can&#39;t stand the fact that an outsider was elected that might end up getting everyone on the fucking planet killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason you see such an organized &quot;upvote to blame Russia, Trump / downvote to question the media or Western spook agency narrative&quot; is because three groups all want to push the &quot;muh Russia&quot; narrative, some for different reasons.</p>

<p>The DNC-Shareblue shillbots of course want to push this as an anti-Trump narrative.  They aren&#39;t necessarily pushing for war -- cold or hot -- they are just political opportunists.</p>

<p>The shill accounts for Western intel agencies and what is often referred to as the military industrial complex <em>do</em> want a cold war because it&#39;s good for both of their respective businesses.  They mostly just want more defense spending.</p>

<p>And then you have the globalists and their shills.  They despise Trump and Russia because both represent their primary enemy: nationalism.  Their end goal might well be domination by any means -- even war.</p>

<p>These culminate together to generate the upside down vote totals you see in some conspiracy threads like this one where so called &quot;conspiracy&quot; posters rush to embrace the official government line.</p>

<p>I said in another comment that I believed both Russia and Russian&#39;s enemies had equal reason to want the spy killed.  But in retrospect, I was wrong.  Globalists, in particular, both in the deep state and in our intel agencies, had the most to gain.</p>

<p>Other than pushing the Russia narrative, the attack highlighted two things:  the impotence of Britain as a credible threat militarily, and the related narrative that Britain alone (that is, post Brexit Britain without the weight of the EU) is more prone to being pushed around than a globalized, EU-controlled Britain.</p>

<p>So the globalist faction, using like minded elements inside western intel agencies -- or maybe even their own people -- are the most likely culprits based on who had the most to gain.</p>

<p>And since the globalists have been called out of late and tried to shield themselves with laughable accusations of Antisemitism in order to immediately shut down any attention being drawn to them, I should point out that by &#39;globalist&#39; I do not mean &#39;TEH J00S.&#39;  I mean people who want a single, worldwide authority to administrate and police us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post and I will try to give you an educated answer (although I&#39;m reminded on a daily basis I know nothing). Are you a god believing person? Have you tried asking him what&#39;s going on? Because it actually works as most of the great philosophers will attest to, although many know it as meditation.</p>

<p>I think Plato does a good job of covering these types of topics in his The Republic. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s put on the hat of government for a second and decide that manipulating the masses is for the greater good, because to people like you and me it is quite obvious. Why would they need to do this?</p>

<p>Is it because the human condition requires being reminded that war is bad every decade and century? Would it not be most appropriate to give people their need for bloodlust and war in a controlled setting where the victors are decided before hand by the hidden world government? This way they can all be reminded for the next 70 years that Hitlers are bad and war / violence is bad.</p>

<p>Is it because in order to maintain order and control, the world needs a single large military force to prevent any others from growing too large? So we have to make up these false flags in order to prevent people from complaining that people are starving while the government buys another 1000 missiles for $100k each?</p>

<p>Is it because the economy is shitty and blowing up all our old toys in the desert creates demand from the military industrial complex to help the government funnel money into the economy?</p>

<p>There are three reasons right there that all may have some truth to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s the other way around. Putin is using everyone else to improve Russian image and influence around the world. I think Russia is going for the &quot;World superpower&quot; again after a severe stagnation.</p>

<p>What we&#39;ll see from them is probably:<br/>
-Stockpiling nuclear weapons and deployment methods<br/>
-Total brain drain of anybody with Russian experience
-Building the Russian buffer zones back up<br/>
-Eliminating potential NATO expansions<br/>
-Aggressive pushes towards resource exploitation<br/>
-Destabilizing political landscapes in any rival</p>

<p>We&#39;ll probably see President for Life Putin and a sudden death in Terrorist organizations, because they only intensify military expenditure and internal defensiveness</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has it occured to Russia that it is very strange that the UK, a country of no military significance, a country that could be completely destroyed forever in a few minutes by Russia, would concoct false charges against the Russian government, announce these charges publicly without providing any evidence whatsoever, bring the unsupported charges to the UN, issue an ultimatum to Russia, dispell Russian diplomats and seize Russian assets on the basis of mere allegations, all the while refusing any evidence and any cooperation with Russia, as required by law, in the investigation of the charges?</p>

<p>Russians, both government, media and youth brainwashed by American propaganda and the Washington-funded NGOS that the Russian government permits to operate against itself in Russia, seem to think that the many accusations and threats issued against Russia are some kind of mistake that can be rectified by recourse to evidence and law. Apparently, after all these years the Russians still do not understand that Washington and its vassals have no interest whatsoever in facts or law.</p>

<p>At the UN the Russian ambassador, in response to the evidence-free accusation by the UK prime minister that the Russian government had used a military-grade nerve agent to attempt to kill two people on an English park bench, went through all the legal reasons, including the requirement of collaboration with Russia in examining the evidence, to establish that the UK accusation was in violation of law and unsupported by any evidence.</p>

<p>Why do the Russians think the British government cares a hoot about law or evidence? Are the Russians really this brainwashed about the West?</p>

<p>The British government of Tony Blair cooperated with the George W. Bush regime in propagating the lie that Saddam Hussein in Iraq had “weapons of mass destruction.” This lie was used to invade and to destroy Iraq and to leave the country 15 years later in chaos.</p>

<p>The British goverment also supported the lies about Gadaffi in Libya and participated in overthrowing the Libyan government. The British government also supported the lie that Iran had a nuclear weapons program. There was never any evidence, but evidence was of no interest. An agenda was in motion, and the agenda was independent of evidence.</p>

<p>Although the British Parliament voted down British participation in Obama’s planned invasion of Syria, the current British government supports the lie that Assad is using chemical weapons “against his own people.”</p>

<p>By now one would think that Russians, both government, media, and public, would understand that all the West is capable of is to lie. The purpose of the lies is to demonize Russia and to set up Russia for military attack.</p>
