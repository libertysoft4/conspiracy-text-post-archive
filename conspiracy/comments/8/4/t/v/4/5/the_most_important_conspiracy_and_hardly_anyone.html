        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Poverty is manufactured and maintained.  money works differently to how you have been led to believe.</p>

<p>there is not a finite amount of money.  it is infinite...   money is created in massive amounts daily and is deleted (banked) in massive amounts daily.   debt is use to control. mortgages  (deathpledge) are used to tie you to an area for many years.  our leaders know this and they use this sleight of hand to enslave all of humanity.   let me be clear - their is plenty for everyone on the planet at least 10,000 times over!
every country is in debt to the same mafia cabal... but its all just a con.  compound interest is the reason certain groups maintain power and others remain poor and in slavery.   we are their debts slaves that keep them in power...   there is none so hopelessly enslaved as those who believe they are free.. we are not free!  we are free range!  we all have to work, we all have to pay taxes under threats of violence, to the MAN.  unfortunately most cannot see this, because we are born into slavery.  indeed take away most peoples need to work, and they will be lost. such is the institutionalization we have been subjected to.</p>

<p>all is not lost. there are options.. we can do somethings...  but first the knowledge of the cage, will lead to freedom from it.  freetime is what we need.  we cannot be free till we have our own free time! so we can work for us, and our loved ones..imagine what you would do if you had enough money so you didn&#39;t HAVE to work for them.  your birthright has been stolen.  do you want to get it back?</p>

<p>they killed jesus because he tried to tell people this... the only time he ever lost his temper, was when he found out about the moneylenders...  shortly after they killed him.  (if you believe in the bible)</p>

<p>usury has always been illegal and unlawful.. yet we now find all the countries in the world are practicing it on its people?   so strange hmmmm</p>

<p>please share this knowledge....  each one teach one.   :D   peace be with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not totally familiar with the reasons, but &#39;the Jews&#39; are right up there with &#39;Illuminati&#39;, &#39;Freemasons&#39;, and &#39;Bildeburg&#39; when it comes to alleged perpetrators of mass conspiracies.</p>

<p>If you believed all of them you could be forgiven for thinking all Jews are technologically advanced shape-shifting lizards who live in a prehostoric paradise in the center of the earth, emerging from their Antarctic surface portal to control humanity with VR, holograms, and good-old-fashioned espionage so they can either eat us or just kill us all and take the planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to say something terribly mean to you for posting that. But i am not sure why i am upset.</p>

<p>While part of your post is true......its the fact that its true is exactly why so few people will wake up and realize that some conspiracy theorists are not nutjobs. </p>

<p>I do 100% believe the OP&#39;s original comment is based on alot of hard facts and truthful statements........i dont think many (or maybe not any? )of the things in your post are true.</p>

<p>But when you ask the common man what do conspiracy theorists think......their answer is - all the stuff in OPs post and all the stuff in your post.</p>

<p>So because its all lumped together people assume alot of it *(or all of it )
is false.</p>

<p>Just because a group of people say alot of crazy stuff......does not mean everything they say is crazy. </p>

<p>OP posted it in a conspiracy forum because he knows we will read and listen. But no one else will listen because the people outside the conspiracy forums think we are all nutjobs who think jews turn into lizards and eat babies at child prostitution rings in pizza parlor basements.</p>

<p>Its so hard for me to make a point cause i am confused how to say what i mean to say. Ugh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re referring to the cabal being primarily Zionist and that shredding light or speaking against said cabal is considered &quot;anti-semetic&quot; then I understand what you&#39;re getting at...</p>

<p>..but most here know that Zionism and Judaism are diametrically opposed and that same victimized camaraderie they attempt to take advantage of is used to make any dissenter seem a insensitive monster </p>

<p>Saying:</p>

<p>&quot;Jews are greedy and should be cast out of society&quot; is anti-semetic</p>

<p>Saying:</p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s a group of bankers that have certain ideological beliefs that they are genealogically advanced compared to the rest of humanity therefore should rule over them and manipulate/coerce them into a system that enslaves them and is based on keeping them ignorant, and that&#39;s fucked up&quot; is recognizing a messed up pattern and attempting to bring it to others attention so that it can change</p>

<p>The term &quot;Anti-Semetic&quot; is thrown around much too loosely as a blanket term to describe anyone who disagrees with/opposes Zionism and that&#39;s a blatant tactic so try not to fall victim to it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antisemitism is just as justified as Islamophobia. Both religions are supremacist. Both teach their followers that non-believers are inferior. Both teach a high degree of nepotism.</p>

<p>Why would we have people who can&#39;t integrate into our society, and think themselves superior to the native peoples? We don&#39;t need Jews or Muslims in our societies. Both of these groups have their own homelands.</p>

<p>What is wrong with wanting Europe to stay European; Israel to stay ethnically Jewish; American to stay <a href="https://imgur.com/CqOyvY1">American</a> etc?</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/JtuoCgE">This agenda is racial</a>. Look at the <a href="https://therionorteline.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/100416_2343_forarthurka1.jpg?w=700">Kalergi plan</a>.</p>

<p>Replacing Whites with Africans and Mexicans reduces the IQ, which conveniently creates a slave population for the Zionists.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, far-right nationalism is the only thing that can stand up to the Zionists. You might not like it, but that&#39;s the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s a psyop in itself in the same way the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; was coined by the CIA to discredit those who seek truth and threaten to expose the secrets and pull back the curtain</p>

<p>It&#39;s really easy to direct people&#39;s thinking process especially when the majority don&#39;t practice critical thought</p>

<p>The more you hear it the more ridiculous it sounds... but truth is stranger than fiction</p>

<p>They are actively trying to rule the world, and they aren&#39;t real Jews</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to understand<a href="https://cis.org/Jewish-Stake-Americas-Changing-Demography">&quot;&quot;&quot;them&quot;&quot;&quot;</a>, read this. It&#39;s written by a Jew, for his fellow Jews. it was written 3 weeks after 9/11.</p>

<p>The Jews have created an environment where society is formed from multiple protected minorities. This allows the Jew to be safe, because otherwise they know that <a href="https://imgur.com/Ox2r4bh">whites will revolt</a> against (excerpt from the article I linked above) them for what they have done.</p>

<p>The Jews don&#39;t want to genocide whites for the sake of genocide whites. They want white genocide because it would create a<a href="https://imgur.com/JtuoCgE"> low IQ slave population for them to rule over</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All true except I would re-phrase that last statement.  There is no intended meaning that I know of for the races.  What could be said, however, is that due to differences among the races, especially IQ, it is therefore difficult for them to live in harmony when in close proximity.  (different goals and ways of achieving goals.  Differences in delayed gratification, and therefore crime and punishment. etc.)  IMHO.</p>

<p>This is true, but the difference is that <em>usually</em> the person &quot;living it up&quot; off of the system, usually will not have anything of value their entire life....there wont be anything to hand down to their kids, no money in the savings etc etc
Yeah they are living large on our dime now, new tv, new Escalade, newest smart phone etc etc but they aint buying a 4 bedroom house on a couple hundred acres....there may be 1 or 2 that can do that, but the average dirtbag that mooches the system drinks and smokes their money away while scrapping $$ for rent in a shit hole apartment building or a section 8 house on the other side of town</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think lazy people aren&#39;t really a huge part of the problem.  I think the biggest part of the problem is our debt-based fractional reserve monetary system that creates a no win situation for those on the bottom because they can never escape their debt.  There is an artificial burden on every person that consumes a large chunk of our working energy and it doesn&#39;t need to be there.  A huge chunk of our taxes go exclusively to paying off previous debts or just the interest from debts.</p>

<p>Secondly, a huge amount of our energy is siphoned away to the government and is used very inefficiently, in black projects, or in blowing people up, or whatnot.  There&#39;s also a ton of people that are middle men, which are providing services that we don&#39;t really need.  Just imagine all the working hours that could be saved by replacing bankers with a digital system, or the financial industry with simple index funds that are automated.</p>

<p>Beyond that, most of our work is BS work which is highly demotivating.  If society made a conscious effort to eliminate BS work and in placing people in jobs that better fit their internal motivations, people would be more inclined to want to work.</p>

<p>People that just sit on their couches smoking blunts and playing video games aren&#39;t living very satisfying lives, those are crutches because real life is that sucky.  If we make real life better for everyone, they will want to participate.</p>

<p>Do you think adam and eve worked? Nope. They walked around like dogs and cats......as free as a bird. And they never worked a day in their life. If they were hungry they picked berries and ate them. And surely they didnt live to be 90 yrs old and have advanced medicine for pain. They didnt drive a tesla to the store and get mcdonalds. Because they had fresh fruit anytime they wanted it and they didnt need to go to a store.</p>

<p>**adam and eve is used here as a figurative term for early man.</p>

<p>We only habe to &quot;work&quot; if we want to have cell phones and internet and space shuttle flights. If we went back to 400000 yrs ago.......the people didnt have to work. They werent quite as safe from animal attacks or famine or heavy weather storms. But they didnt work a day in their lives.</p>

<p>Yes, there was poverty before the Fed.  There&#39;s always going to be some poverty.  But there&#39;s a difference between some poverty and 80% of the richest nation in the world populating having less than $500 in their bank for emergencies.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a private company. It is a private-public partnership, for good reason. And, yes, I&#39;m okay with it. We saw numerous boom and bust cycles throughout the 1800 hundreds, with large recessions (drops above 10% and often even above 25%) every other year. The economy was very unstable, and the fed system was developed to steady this out. We had our biggest bust right after its implementation, but then the economic busts were much smaller and further apart (around 3-5% and only every 3 years or so) throughout the 1900s.</p>

<p>It seems to have worked.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>People have more access to food, more access to healthcare, more access to housing, more access to education, than any other time in history. I&#39;m not arguing that everything is perfect nor that we aren&#39;t on a bad path, but the idea that the fed, which follow its implementation led to a better economy for the average joe and a decrease in the share of the wealth of the top 10%, doesn&#39;t make much sense.</p>

At least the money was used to benefit our country as a whole and not just given to the banks who risked their solvency out of greed and needed to be bailed out by the public /s.

<p>This is because of the risks involved for the lender as well as the lender needing an income for themselves to make it worth their time. As long as there is strong competition in financial services, the interest rates offered will always be reasonable.</p>

<p>You can do this in many countries but in all the highly developed countries there are land shortages so its not possible. Land is a finite resource. Planning permission needs to be granted to ensure its used effectively. In most developed countries, all citizens have a right to free accommodation provided by the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you forget that a private group controls the money supply and can print on demand. They can (and do) devalue your dollar over night.</p>

<p>Our system is broken. 2008 and the aftermath (QE) prove that the financial system we have all been forced to participate in is a corrupt scam that only benefits the people controlling it. </p>

<p>Why does our country have to borrow money from a private institution instead of controlling the money supply for the people (essentially by the people).</p>

<p>Sure, a basic understanding of economics shows that our system works. Once you dig deeper, it&#39;s obvious that the system is in place to enslave the population. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. But why do we allow a small group of private individuals to decide when and how much is printed?</p>

<p>So you supported the bank bailout and QE?</p>

<p>You know when the majority of our middle class was suffering and getting kicked out of their homes, the heads of the banks that caused the crisis were taking home record bonuses? We, the people, have no control or say over the creation and distribution of our money supply. They can devalue your dollar by 30% while making a few currupt bankers even more wealthy than they we&#39;re. </p>

<p>Since the Fed is essentially private, we have no say over the future of our wealth and our savings. </p>

<p>The central banks have been devaluing their currencies at an extreme rate. Since they&#39;re all valued against each other, the currencie&#39;s value doesnt appear to be free falling because they&#39;re all falling. We only value currencies relative to the others. Therefore if all central banks devalue, the public will be too ignorant to notice. In other words, the central banks are colluding to devalue all currencies and essentially devalue your income and savings in the name of economic prosperity. They&#39;re robbing the poor to pay the rich.</p>

<p>This is not true. The value of a currency is how much goods it can be. For example how much food costs. Inflation can be tracked and inflation has been pretty low in Europe. The only thing which has had very high inflation is house prices in the most successful countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re misunderstanding the OP.  In fact, I think you need to take a remedial conspiracy class.  I posted a link above on where you can start learning why our current fiat currency is illegitimate, and serves to only make sure we are all debt-slaves.  </p>

<p>The short of it is, our money is magically created on computers by the federal reserve, which is a PRIVATE corporation created in 1913 by shady cabal types, and snuck into law during a friday news dump.  It took us off the gold standard, and allowed a private company to create the currency we use as a country, and loan that currency back to us, with interest.  Which means the government will always be in debt, not to other countries, but to this monster they created, because there will never be enough money to cover the interest of the money this cabal is creating.  And this cabal can create money whenever they want, or whenever their head wants.  The money used to bail out the banks after the housing crisis didn&#39;t exist until it was needed.  Our money system is based on debt, and we pay off that debt by enslaving ourselves to corporate masters with ties to this cabal.  I shared this above, but Aaron Russo starts explaining the problem well in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzdauRnKFA">video</a>, and you probably only need to start listening to the first 10-20 minutes of him actually talking to get it.  Unless you choose to keep your mind closed.  </p>

<p>Not accurate, it is a public private/public hybrid, for good reason. If it was completely public, it would be far too subject to the political whims of congress and so policy wouldn&#39;t be made based on what the members think is right, but based on the political pressure applied to them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not accurate either. It was hotly contested, debated over, modified and changed all through almost all of 1912 and 1913. This idea that it &quot;snuck&quot; in there during a single day is nonsense.</p>

<p>The first two points you make are just blatantly factually incorrect. There are many legitimate criticisms of the fed, but you should probably understand the basic facts of the system before pretending you know anything about it.</p>

In many rural areas basically the woman works the field and the man sits at home (in the mud hut) doing practically nothing or very little.  If this family earns $1 a day and somehow manages to earn $2 instead then what is almost guaranteed to happen is that the man will use that extra $1 on buying a beer that day. Seriously. I&#39;m not kidding. These rural people don&#39;t need (a lot of) money as such anyway, because they live off the land and don&#39;t pay rent/mortgages etc. So it&#39;s not like they&#39;re out on the street if they don&#39;t make any money in any given month. Trying to classify such people in poverty statistics that include also people living in cities make little sense but this is what is happening. So rural people (which is most of the worlds population) are not suddenly lifted out of &#39;poverty&#39; because they escape some statistic that is meaningless anyway.</p>

<p>How can you say eye color is just an attirbute? It&#39;s clearly meaningful. For example, blue eyes are more sensitive to light, which allows for better night vision.</p>

<p>Race is the same. Look into race and IQ. Look into the race and the MAO-A gene. Look into race and skull shapes. Look into race and testosterone. Look into race and body fat percentage. And there is many more.</p>

<p>These aren&#39;t meaningless attributes. They are very very meaningful.</p>

<p>There is a reason why Sub-Saharan Africans have never built a coherent civilization. There is a reason why when the Europeans first discovered them, they still hadn&#39;t built a two story building, nor the wheel, nor created an alphabet.</p>

<p>Genetics plays a huge factor in our lives, but people today want to believe that genetics don&#39;t matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>supremacist = ethnonationalist.  Unless you believe that a civilization&#39;s flaws and benefits depend uniquely on the perspective of the observer (meaning that they don&#39;t have inherent value in and of itself) then you believe there is one race that is superior to all the others, so your a supremacist... it just may not be your own race.</p>

<p>Natural selection has halted within the human race.  Primarily because of our own bias to things like us (instead of mutations that benefit the entire culture).  Further proof that nurture is more dominant than nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“The few who understand the system, will either be so interested from its profits or so dependent on its favors, that there will be no opposition from that class.” . . . “Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who writes the laws.” - Mayer Amschel Bauer Rothschild</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;If all the bank loans were paid, no one could have a bank deposit, and there would not be a dollar of coin or currency in circulation. This is a staggering thought. We are completely dependent on the commercial banks. Someone has to borrow every dollar we have in circulation, cash, or credit. If the banks create ample synthetic money we are prosperous; if not, we starve. We are absolutely without a permanent money system. When one gets a complete grasp of the picture, the tragic absurdity of our hopeless situation is almost incredible -- but there it is.&quot; - Robert Hemphill</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;Once a nation parts with the control of its currency and credit, it matters not who makes the nations laws. Usury, once in control, will wreck any nation. Until the control of the issue of currency and credit is restored to government and recognised as its most sacred responsibility, all talk of the sovereignty of parliament and of democracy is idle and futile.&quot; - William Lyon Mackenzie King</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;I am afraid that the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that banks can and do create money ...And they who control the credit of the nation direct the policy of Governments and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of the people&quot; - Reginald McKenna</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;There is nothing left now for us but to get ever deeper and deeper into debt to the banking system in order to provide the increasing amounts of money the nation requires for its expansion and growth. Our money system is nothing better than a confidence trick... The &quot;money power&quot; which has been able to overshadow ostensibly responsible government is not the power of the merely ultra-rich but is nothing more or less than a new technique to destroy money by adding and withdrawing figures in bank ledgers, without the slightest concern for the interests of the community or the real role money ought to perform therein... to allow it to become a source of revenue to private issuer&#39;s is to create, first, a secret and illicit arm of government and, last, a rival power strong enough to ultimately overthrow all other forms of government. ...An honest money system is the only alternative.&quot; - Frederick Soddy</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;That is what our money system is. If there were no debts in our money system, there wouldn’t be any money.&quot; - Marriner S. Eccles</p>

<hr/>

<p>“Gold is the money of kings, silver is the money of gentlemen, barter is the money of peasants – but debt is the money of slaves.” - Norm Franz </p>

<hr/>

<p>“One thing to realize about our fractional reserve banking system is that, like a child’s game of musical chairs, as long as the music is playing, there are no losers.” - Andrew Gause</p>

<hr/>

<p>“The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.” - Albert A. Bartlett</p>

<hr/>

<p>“Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist.”  - Kenneth Boulding</p>

<hr/>

<p>“All the perplexities, confusion and distresses in America arise not from defects in the constitution or confederation, nor from want of honor or virtue, as much from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit, and circulation.” - John Adams</p>

<hr/>

<p>“If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks…will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered…. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.” . . . “Paper is poverty. It is the ghost of money and not money itself.” - Thomas Jefferson</p>

<hr/>

<p>“I have never yet had anyone who could, through the use of logic and reason, justify the Federal Government borrowing the use of its own money... I believe the time will come when people will demand that this be changed. I believe the time will come in this country when they will actually blame you and me and everyone else connected with the Congress for sitting idly by and permitting such an idiotic system to continue.”  - Congressman Wright Patman</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;I am afraid that the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that banks can and do create money ...And they who control the credit of the nation direct the policy of Governments and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of the people&quot; - Reginald McKenna</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;The process by which banks create money is so simple the mind is repelled.&quot; ... &quot;The study of money, above all other fields in economics, is one in which complexity is used to disguise truth or to evade truth, not to reveal it.&quot; - John Kenneth Galbraith</p>

<hr/>

<p>“Money is a new form of slavery, and distinguishable from the old simply by the fact that it is impersonal, that there is no human relation between master and slave.” - Leo Tolstoy</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin. Bankers own the Earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and with the flick of the pen they will create enough money to buy it back again...
Take this great power away from them and all great fortunes like mine will disappear, and they ought to disappear, for then this would be a better and happier world to live in. But if you want to continue to be slaves of the banks and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let bankers continue to create money and control credit.&quot; - Sir Josiah Stamp</p>

<hr/>

<p>“When a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation, since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes… Money has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency; their sole object is gain.” - Napoleon Bonaparte</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;Throughout the ages,the devices of cunning men have turned money to their nefarious purposes. Money, beginning with private enterprise as a means of escaping the limitation of barter, soon developed the cheat to exploit the honest trader who, in an effort to protect himself, turned to government for protection, only to find that now he had two thieves, the private money changer and the political plunderer working hand in glove against him. By this combination the money changer gained the prestige of political sanction through legislative license and the state secured a deceptive device for laying taxes upon the citizenry (by means of the hidden tax called inflation). It was and remains a vicious alliance.&quot; - E.C. Reigel</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world&#39;s central banks, which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank...sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world.&quot; - Carroll Quigley</p>

They are not Government institutions. They are private credit monopolies which prey

to buy votes to control our legislation; and there are those that maintain an international 
propaganda for deceiving us... that will permit them to cover up their past misdeeds and

one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. The Federal Reserve

Speaker, it is a monstrous thing for this great Nation to have its destiny presided over by 
a treasonous system acting in secret concert with International pirates and userers. Every

<p>&quot;The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson&quot; - President Franklin D. Roosevelt </p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;Political parties exist to secure responsible government and to execute the will of the people. From these great tasks both of the old parties have turned aside. Instead of instruments to promote the general welfare they have become the tools of corrupt interests, which use them impartially to serve their selfish purposes. Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics, is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.&quot; - Theodore Roosevelt</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great collection of banking quotes. I think most of them are generally correct, although I could nitpick on a few details here and there.</p>

<p>Anyway, I reply to complain about one that I think is bad, the first one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The few who understand the system, will either be so interested from its profits or so dependent on its favors, that there will be no opposition from that class.” . . . “Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who writes the laws.” - Mayer Amschel Bauer Rothschild</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those individual people who collect government benefits, welfare, food, housing, HEAP, retirement, whatever -- are not in any way prevented from opposing governmental actions. For example, if you are over age 66 and you are entitled to retirement based on the rules, you get it regardless.</p>

<p>This notion is dangerous because a casual reader may conclude that we should oppose our own programs for people -- poor people, old people, disabled people, people living in economically oppressed areas, etc. If that&#39;s the conclusion, the elites gain exactly what they want and the people suffer. I suggest you take this quote out next time you post.</p>

<p>Also, you have a duplicate in there. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of time you could rent a place, which would be cheaper than getting a mortgage and then paying it off, and then investing the difference in deposits, bonds, shares. With mortgage you&#39;re paying for like 2-3 houses you actually get, whilst with rent you&#39;re not. Presumably your rent would be based on local average, which would factor in the time to pay off the investment in a particular real estate object. This could be anywhere between 5-15 years. But still, for the owner it&#39;s the time enough to cover the cost of <strong>ONE</strong> object (house in this case).</p>

<p>Mortgage is when you pay essentially for 2-3 houses over the course of those 15-25 years you take it on. So the difference between paying rent for 15 years, saving the rest of the money you&#39;d otherwise spend on covering the mortgage, and paying the full mortgage is one full house that you will afford in the end anyway. Difference is, with rent you can move to a different place, can avoid property risks (if it all crashes, you&#39;re good, you&#39;ve got liquid bonds, deposits and shares). Sure, you&#39;re losing out on appreciation of housing over time, but you&#39;re not exposed to the inherent risks. </p>

<p>So if you compare the numbers, it&#39;s more value to not get the mortgage and rent, while investing the difference. So by having more financial knowledge and educating oneself of those other financial tools at your disposal you could escape the debt prison you&#39;re all so worried about. </p>

<p>If anything, there are fewer people (by percentage) in poverty right now than in any other time in human history. We have been steadily declining poverty over the years.</p>

<p>There is certainly something to be said about the wealth accumulating in the hands of the few, but this is not the result of our banking system, it has been an issue throughout human history. It is something that has constantly ebbed and waned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Poverty is a complicated term to operationalize. </p>

<p>It is obvious that if you use a stringent understading of what poverty is then you&#39;re correct. We&#39;re doing better than ever.</p>

<p>(source: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty">https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty</a>)</p>

<p>If we&#39;re using the standard defintion of poverty then this is the correct answer. </p>

<p>But I do interpret OP&#39;s post in a slightly different way. I think he talks about relative wealth and then the picture is very different. </p>

<p>We are currently in an age of rapid technological and economical growth. We produce more goods than ever before by a large margin. But the surplus is absorbed by a very small percentage of the population. </p>

<p>This is especially notable in countries like the US, where we see that the average wages has gone down while productivity has soared.</p>

<p>(source: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/17/higher-productivity-used-to-mean-higher-wages-has-that-broken-down/?utm_term=.0e93e6dc2e43">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/17/higher-productivity-used-to-mean-higher-wages-has-that-broken-down/?utm_term=.0e93e6dc2e43</a>)</p>

<p>Not having the economical means to enjoy the fruits of a highly developed economy can certainly be interpreted as poverty. You might not starve to death, but you are excluded from many of the prime functions of society. </p>

<p>So if we talk about relative wealth instead of poverty OP makes more sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I disagree. You only have to go back to 1916, right after the founding of the fed, to find a wealth distribution like we have today. It steadily declined until about the 1980s, where it shifted around. If the fed were responsible for this, why did we see such a drop following it&#39;s enactment? Not to mention, there are many points throughout history where the wealth was heavily <a href="http://time.com/money/3977798/the-10-richest-people-of-all-time/">concentrated in the hands of the few.</a></p>

<p>Wealth concentration is not a creation of the fed, it&#39;s always been around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the surplus is absorbed by a very small percentage of the population.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice how the rise of the wealth concentration coincides with the rise in automation and globalization, and about 70 years after the foundation of the fed. It&#39;s silly to point to the fed as the primary driver of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not having the economical means to enjoy the fruits of a highly developed economy can certainly be interpreted as poverty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree. This isn&#39;t &quot;poverty&quot; by any stretch of the imagination. Is it profoundly unfair? Sure. Is it a recipe for social unrest? I believe so. But poverty it is not. That has a very specific meaning. If we want to say &quot;relative wealth&quot; then we shouldn&#39;t use the incorrect term &quot;poverty.&quot;</p>

<p>This was done in the past by sheer brutal force, enslavement, draconian autocratic laws, etc. but that wouldn’t work now due to the explosion in population, tech, etc. The establishment of the banking and fractional reserve system was a more sophisticated way of doing the same but at an even larger scale. </p>

<p>Again, less people live in abject poverty now, but those loving in debt has risen dramatically. That’s the control. That’s the conspiracy. That people don’t recognize this. That throwing everyone a bone so that they can afford a car (again this is only in a fraction of the world) and live in this consumerist society is enough to pacify us and let us blindly follow along. </p>

<p>Examples and citations, please.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think there is a big problem with wealth concentrating in the hands of the few. However, I think trying to blame the fractional reserve system is ridiculous. After the founding of the fractional reserve, the amount of wealth in the hands of the top 10% followed a downward path to the bottom until the mid 80s, and then started to ramp back up. If the federal reserve is responsible for this, why did it take over 70 years for the wealth to start concentrating? Are we suggesting that the people who were in on this conspiracy were doing it to no benefit of themselves? It seems so silly to me.</p>

I would also argue that those calling the shots are certainly not 10%, that club is much smaller. The concentration has certainly moved forward continuously for the handful of well known and less known banking families. </p>

<p>I would also point out that raising the living quality of the average population does not mean the system is not designed to further control the masses and use debt as its main tool. These are not mutually exclusive. Just like medical science in many areas have improved and child mortality rates have overall fallen, but it doesn’t mean the pharmaceutical industry and food industry isn’t using special interest and lobbyists to inflict incredible health issues and dependencies by the public. It’s not the best analogy but I’m trying to point out that binary thinking is a standard way of controlling the thought process. </p>

If you think we&#39;re actually financially better off than we were 50-100 years ago then you&#39;re looking at things in a vacuum, and not at the bigger picture.</p>

<p>You really think the Federal Reserve is something that benefitted the public?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money is not a cause nor a goal, it is just a tool. And indeed one that is warned about if it were used in the combination with interest on debt. We have now arrived at the part of the &quot;tale&quot; where we can more openly see and/ or experience the fruits of our labour and the labour of some influencing humanity behind the scenes. This is al reveiled slowly now for those willing to see.</p>

<p>While our global econonies and monetary systems are slowly but surely breaking down some are already desperately calling for a &quot;savior&quot; and are forcefully grappling on to straws while they are looking for ways to preserve their view &quot;reality&quot; and way of living.</p>

<p>Luckely for them the first &quot;savior&quot; has appeart on the horizon, Crypto currency is it&#39;s name. This will be followed by more and more people, completely convinced it is THE way to go. Until a certain point is reached where there is so much invested that some are ready to pop the bubble and some discover a thread to the safety of all the current Crypto&#39;s.</p>

<p>This will cause chaos and will make loose some people all they have world wide. This will be the catalist and it will be used to present the next &quot;savior&quot; of humanity and the new &quot;forced&quot; globel crypto blockchain designed by AI. This AI is the second &quot;savior&quot; of humanity and will be followed by many until forced on almost all.</p>

<p>The AI Crypto will draw the world in furter until some are ready to get completely invested and are desperately wanting the &quot;mark of the beast&quot; placed into themselves.</p>

<p>This is the acceptance of the mark of the beast, the rfid chip that will be implanted and willl be used for more and more until it becomes impossible to &quot;live&quot; without.</p>

<p>The 5G cell networks, blue tooth, wifi and the internet of things is being rolled out and like always, some people are ready to jump on it and want to play with all they new toys. Very soon now people will start to get implanted cell phones and &quot;led&quot; contact lenses those things are already possible and our consumer products are just the tip of the iceberg of the tech that already exists.</p>

<p>But where does this AI come from? Well, this is already running behing &quot;the&quot; and our screens. It is in the process of mapping everybody and evrything so it can make personal files on everything and know more about you then you yourself. The AI and d wave will be brought as our saviors becouse it will provide the ultimate global &quot;solutions&quot; for humanity. And when the AI is installed in the open and accepted by almost all people it will be used agains humanity in a way some can&#39;t even imagine now.</p>

<p>We create our reality, when we observe something with our sensec WE manifest it in extistence and our reality. We do this with always, many, many, many times a second.</p>

<p>Obeservation -&gt; thought -&gt; emotion -&gt; reaction -&gt; action -&gt; creating -&gt; observing -&gt;</p>

<p>An never ending cycle that goes on inside us all and represents our interactions between this reality, our body, our consiousness, our subconsiousness and our spirit. And we who can be in complete controll if we learn how to focus ourselves and consiousnesses are often not aware of this cycle becouse we are to distracted to notice it.</p>

<p>Humanity creates this world literary, the AI and those using it know this and are influencing and playing humanity for ever as seen from our perspective. We have a free will, so we need to give our concent before something can be manifested as real.</p>

<p>For the moment our ego and mind determin if we want to actively play, or if we just want to ride along while somebody or something creates through you. Free will, ignorance, fear, indifference and many more things are making people more or less arware of the mechanics and games behind the screens. Ofcourse many tech and other manipulation is already used against humanity so we can give away our creative powers happely unaware or unknowing.</p>

<p>How could AI make it worse? Well if humanity would allow every inch of their life monitored... their thoughts known through tech and media... their location, mood and all what is making them real... ALL the time....</p>

<p>Well then AI could easely &quot;hack&quot; our connections between mind, body, soul and spirit and make you think what IT wants you to think and create while IT is able to observe and experience IT&#39;s desired reality through the tech. It will be using us as the creator while being the mind and observer through tech and programms.</p>

<p>Humanity is on the verge of being converted into drones that create the desires from some behind the AI, or even the AI itself and some will be cheering while it happens. The AI is the second anti-crist and the beginning of an end as is foretold by some.</p>

<p>WE have the power, &quot;they&quot; can&#39;t create so they are using fear and our ego&#39;s against us. Keep us in duality and chaos, in misery and dispear, so we don&#39;t even want to find out the power WE all have.</p>

<p>The truth, Forgiving and Love will set everybody free, but we all need to realise we can only change our reality in this moment the best. We need to face our own fears to re-unite with ourselves again and the more whole we get, the more we re-unite us all. And most important, don&#39;t forget to be honest to yourself and forgive yourself fo any mistakes, becouse they are only mistakes if you miss the teaching moments they gave you or somebody else.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t led fear or anger to tech get you, everything is just tools, you have the chose to use them for service to self, or service to others. But you always have the choise wether you want to learn more of these tools or stay asleep, this is free will at your service.</p>

<p>Oke, it became a bit long, but this is my theory on money and my &quot;one conspiracy covering all others&quot; financed with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point, trying to nitpick the example. In real life every tool sits idle the vast majority of the time. Your block has 20 idle hammers and it needs just a few. </p>

<p>The point was not about hammers but the theory of your economic system. If currency can be exchanged for something tangible on a fixed basis that keeps the economy grounded. Money at interest is made from thin air.</p>

<p>I ask a bank for $1,000,000 for a big house. They agree. The bank needs only $100,000 to grant this loan, which is money that actually belongs to the other customers.</p>

<p>30 years go by. I have repaid the $1,000,000 that went to wealthy landowners and construction companies. I have also &quot;repaid&quot; $1,000,000 in interest. Hey, that&#39;s a &quot;good&quot; interest rate! :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like in my example earlier the loaned hammer is the same as the loaned $1million. The bank is charging you rent on that $1mil just like some one might charge you rent for usage of a hammer.</p>

<p>In both scenarios, the owner of the desired item (hammer or $1mil) lends it out for a specified time, and wants the item back plus an extra charge for services rendered which in these cases is the rental fee for the hammer or the interest for the money.</p>

<p>you are too hung up on the extra money being generated from nothing since you are selectively choosing where your economic system starts and ends.</p>

<p>I used the hammer example to show that time and services may not be tangible things, but do indeed have monetary value. Just like working a job, you put in time and perform some sort of service for money. Obviously that money isnt created from thin air. </p>

<p>Interest is not money created from thin air, its a fee for services provided. </p>

<p>Alternatively (and i think this is ultimately what you are getting at so hopefully you read this far into my ramblings) you <em>CAN</em> create debt out of thin air. If a kid comes to your house and you ask him to mow your lawn for $10. Once hes done hes essentially added $10 of debt to the economy out of thin air. Think of the kid mowing the lawn like the bank giving you the loan, and the $10 as the interest.</p>

<p>You are renting money. You have to return that money at the end of the rental period along with the cost of the rental. The extra million dollars is the cost of taking someone else&#39;s million dollars away from them for 30 years.</p>

<p>Some people make a living renting cars, others make a living renting apartments. Banks, in part, make a living renting cash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely disagree with the fundamental notion that the whole world is a conspiracy against common folk. This post is exactly that. The world isn&#39;t holding you down, you can climb up the system if you work hard enough and smart enough. Or if you can&#39;t do that in your life time you can set your kids up for success by teaching them the right values and core competencies that are required to succeed. Critical thinking is one of them. </p>

<p>This post is an excuse to not do anything: &quot;Oh why bother, all those crazy oligarchs are out there to enslave me. I amount to nothing <strong>only because</strong> those people exist.&quot; This kind of mentality shifts the locus of control onto those very people that you seem to be so against, those wealthy bankers, corporate CEOs etc that exist within this undoubtedly broken system. This is not the way to approach the problem, not by a long shot. You have to keep the control in your own hands, forge your own destiny, strive for own success. Nobody is reponsible for what you are except yourself. If you choose to get mortgage that you&#39;ll be paying off for the rest of your life, that&#39;s your choice. There are alternatives, you just didn&#39;t bother to learn them. Every little shortcut you take: &quot;oh I&#39;ll just get this payday loan just this once, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fine&quot;, or &quot;I&#39;ll just grab a beer and chill at home, instead of doing my personal finances this time, I&#39;m tired&quot;; all those shortcuts are your own choices, which end up enslaving you. Social media - you get addicted to likes, ruin your life, become miserable. That&#39;s your own choice. You invest into a ponzi scheme, because you can&#39;t think for yourself and messed with something you didn&#39;t understand. Sorry to break it to you, but 99% of what&#39;s happening to you is <strong>your fault</strong>.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t blame everybody else for your shortcomings, educate yourself, learn to think critically and get atop of this broken system to try and fix it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you make a good counter arguement.  There is section of the population that, based on hard work, studying, etc, can rise above.</p>

<p>That&#39;s true.  But, the fundamental issue is still that the system is protecting the owning class.  What&#39;s worse is that over the last 35 years or so, the system has been working even harder to expand the power and wealth ownership of the 1%.  </p>

<p>There is a class war and you and are are on the losing end of it.  Can we break through it?  Some of us can.  Work hard, go to school, and you can get a job within the system and make in into the middle class.</p>

<p>But getting into the ownership class becomes harder and harder as corporations consolidate and make the barriers to entry into markets as a business owner harder and harder.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the point, I think the OP is trying to make.  Your point is also valid, but your point allows for only a small group of the 99% to get by.  The rest of the 99% continue to see thier wages stagnate and their wealth to be transferred to the 1%.</p>

<p>It&#39;s statistically factual.  You can see the wealth transfer that has been going unchecked for decades now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consolidation of power is a problem, I agree, but it isn&#39;t irreversible either. </p>

<p>Problem with consolidation right now is that it comes from information control. Information is the true wealth right now and people give it away for free. People sacrifice their privacy for convenience and that&#39;s what destroys them as a class right now. Facebook can be facebook because it has all those people sharing information, which facebook promptly monetises. Understanding that is very difficult and most people don&#39;t want to, so they are stuck within this cycle. And there&#39;s hardly anything that we can do except educate them on why they should protect information and don&#39;t let the government be in charge of everything. </p>

<p>The worrying trend of consolidation of power has become even scarier due to the fact that before, humans were the source of labour, hence the absolute necessity for those with power. Basically, nothing can be done if you don&#39;t have people on your side. So all those who usurped too much got punished in the end by the angry mob. The situation right now is that we can build robots that do everything that humans used to do, and they do it better. Now this centralisation of wealth is more dangerous, because people matter less and less, up to the point that a small army of robots will just crush any resistance, should it arise. </p>

<p>Basically, in order for people to stop being slaves they have to liberate themselves by giving up everything non-essential, like social media (great means of controlling people, btw). Decentralisation is a great effort to ensure that nobody is significant enough to dictate how the life is to be. So once again people have to educate themselves of that, incorporate these principles in every job they do, even minor ones. Coding is particularly good, because it&#39;s easy to implement decentralised storage/processing/etc. and it has it&#39;s own very beneficial use-cases. Within an organisation one could make each team more autonomous, should one hold enough weight inside an org. All those things add up and form the mindset that we don&#39;t need one big governing agency to sort everything for us, because that&#39;s what breeds corruption. Centralisation of wealth happens because everything else is being centralised as well, we give that away voluntarily. </p>

<p>And the final point I want to make is that people are people in the end. We can be easily corrupted to join the elite in their conquest to control, wealth and centralisation. Basically the scenario is as follows: you have a poor guy, who is sick of being poor, so he works really hard, achieves great results, becomes financially independent. Keeps building on to his success and becomes richer ever so steadily. Every buck that he makes brinds him closer to becoming engulfed by this idea of making a little bit more at some poor guy&#39;s expence. And so this poor guy who was once a victim becomes the abuser itself through his journey to the top, because he&#39;s feeble and succeptible to the temptation. This shit happens all the time and that&#39;s why this war will never truly end. Corruption is a virus that cannot be erradicated, so we must strive to the top, <strong>whilst keeping a strict ethical position regarding this climb to the top</strong>. This is something that needs to be taught and focused on through critical thinking. This isn&#39;t easy to teach, because the person has to be able to come to this conclusion on one&#39;s own. Compassion, empathy are very important. </p>

<p>Anyways, sorry for the wall of text, it&#39;s not really well-structured, just thoughts and conclusions that I&#39;ve come to. Basically it all comes down to conciously striving to the top of the system while maintaining this perspective of what the true struggle is. It&#39;s also absolutely vital to build a functioning system of checks and balances to keep yourself in place. This way, you&#39;ll better the world and not succumb to the corruption. But this is all wishful thinking, I fear that dark times lie ahead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a boot locker who has been programmed to suckle from the propaganda of the ruling class tit to feel alright. Debt has historically been used for the aristocrat class to keep themselves in power and suppress the poor people below them. There are instances when governments disallowed usury and the predatory nature was put at bay, but rich merchants start to influence governments and strip laws away allowing for the concentration of capital. Once concentrated, they create a system of near slavery for their people as they lock them into debts of certain forms with unreasonable ways to pay it back. This generally will cause revolutions, as a main tenant of a revolution is absolving debt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>How could anyone every get trillions in debt?</em>
By borrowing more and more money.</p>

<p><em>If the person lending these trillions out why would they continue to lend?</em>
Because the borrower is a good customer. That trillions is not one lump debt that is never paid back. It is an enormous number of small loans that are constantly being paid back with interest. Since the borrower constantly makes good on its obligations, and the lender constantly makes money, why wouldn&#39;t the lender continue to loan money to the borrower?</p>

<p><em>HOW IN THE &amp;</em>%$ would ANYONE (short of war) attempt to get that loan back?*
That is right on the money. Short of war (economic or military), no one is foreclosing on the U.S. government. The real threat is if the government didn&#39;t pay its debts, no one would loan it any more money.</p>

<p><em>How would we even pay it back? Write a check &quot;To China .... Thanks - USA&quot;</em>
Essentially, that is exactly what happens. The U.S. government is constantly writing checks to pay off all the many loans it has taken out. Also, those loans are not just to the Chinas of the world; many of those loans are to pension funds and mutual funds. Even ordinary citizens of the U.S.A. can and do loan money to the government by buying Treasury Bills/Bonds and U.S. savings bonds.</p>

<p><em>Why can&#39;t we just print more money?</em>
Lots of people have asked this question. The basic problem is that money is not value in and of itself. It is just a way to represent and track value. In a complex modern world, there is no way a pure barter system can realistically work. What individuals (and companies) produce is too large or too specific or too abstract. Instead, everyone receives an accounting and record of the goods and services they produce. This is an accounting of the <em>value</em> added by the individual or company. Now, when someone wants something (food, housing, to employ someone, etc), they give away a part of the accounting of the value they have produced in exchange for what they want. In the old days, before computers and banks, the representation and accounting of value needed to be something reasonably portable and hard to produce (so no one could just create their own). Precious metal coins, for example, were a decent way to do that, and money was invented. Once banks became common, it really wasn&#39;t necessary to have the<br/>
representation of value have any intrinsic value of its own. The accounting ledgers of the bank did the job of storing and tracking the changes in each person/company/government&#39;s value. And paper/fiat money was born. Today, in the wealthier parts of the world, many do without any physical money at all. How do we even do that? Remember, the physical money was just a way to represent and track our value. Now all that can be done much better with electronic records. When we buy, we subtract from our records of our store of value. Whey we sell (goods or our time and labor), we add to our records of our store of value.</p>

<p><em>Wait, you never said why the government can&#39;t just print more money to pay off the loans to China!</em>
You are right, at least not directly. Sorry. Printing paper money is no different than just adding more zeroes to the end of the number in the bank account. The problem is that those extra zeroes aren&#39;t representing any value created by anyone. &quot;So, what!?&quot; you say. Well, if the representation of value increases, but there is no extra value lying around, what you are really, really saying is that each unit of representation is really representing less value. In other words, more dollars, same amount of stuff, each dollar just represents less of the stuff. Essentially, you get hyper-inflation. If each dollar is worth less, pretty soon, that loaf of bread is going to cost you $1000 dollars, because each dollar doesn&#39;t represent nearly as much value as it used to represent; you need a lot more of them to get the same value.</p>

<p>This whole discussion is why economist often talk about the U.S. government debt in terms of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. GDP is a way of adding up the total value produced by everyone in the country. Since the U.S. government gets its &quot;money&quot; by taxing us, they are taking a share of the value we created to be used (in the best case) to provide services back to us. As long as the U.S. government sticks to using the value they took from us or borrowed, and doesn&#39;t go about &quot;magically&quot; creating &quot;money&quot;, the accounting of our personal value doesn&#39;t get negatively impacted.</p>

<p>I hope some of that helped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putting money in a bank is effectively lending the bank the money. So lending an offshore bank the money means that a foreign bank has to pay the interest (if any) on the loan and that a foreign bank can expand a foreign currency by fractional lending. The U.S.A. generally does not tax wealth (except inheritances), but the U.S. does tax earnings by U.S. citizens even if the money is earned outside the U.S. Of course, there are offshore &quot;tax havens&quot; that don&#39;t report earnings, so the U.S. does not receive any taxes from those sources.</p>

<p>Yes, the world is very unfair, unequal, and corrupt.

    <div class="md"><p>I bought my house in 2012 when the market was down. $70,000 for a 4 bedroom house on an acre of land in Los Angeles. It has almost quadrupled in value in the last 6 years. I rented it out for 2 years. I stopped working and lived off the rent money I received while I lived at my parents house. I helped them pay off their house and now they own it. They have no mortgage holding them down. My mortgage is $580 a month in Los Angeles county!!!</p>

<p>Not everyone has to actively participate in the rat race. It is possible to walk thru it like me. Do you think that by earning $50,000 to $150,000 a year you are really living better than someone on welfare? Is your $60,000 vehicle, small $750,000 house in Los Angeles or San Francisco with no yard, and health insurance really worth commuting over an hour every weekday to work 40 to 60 hours a week to come home, eat, shower, and fall asleep? That&#39;s not living. I think its better to focus on the $10,000 boat rather than the $1,000,000 boat. They both float.</p>

<p>The way I see it, you can cut out the middleman and retire before you are 35 if you can settle for a cheap lifestyle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This smells like a bad psyop. Infinite currency is not infinite value. If you print too much money, you devalue all of the other currency in circulation. In fact, this is how you&#39;re being controlled. Not because of OP&#39;s childish &quot;omg print me some money too!&quot; explanation.</p>

<p>The bank fucks over the people by printing money and giving it to themselves and then charging the government (taxpayers) interest on the &quot;loan&quot; they just created. Of course, the government has to want to do that, but since the bank essentially owns the government, it&#39;s always happening. The net effect is that not only do you as a taxpayer owe more tax to pay for this &quot;loan&quot;, your existing currency in your bank account or wallet is now worth less than before as well. Meanwhile, a banker somewhere gets paid a nice bonus and a Rothschild is paid interest for money he created out of thin air the instant he decided to &quot;loan&quot; it to you.</p>

<p>I think of myself as a realist, but most people would call me a pessimist. From my limited understanding of things, I have no idea how we are going to continue on like this. I&#39;ve even questioned if I should have children based on the way society is headed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hippy liberal lurker checking in. Great post OP. Not everyone should live like Bill Gates but there is more than enough resources and money for everyone to live like a lower middle class American. We(the world) have the resource for every human to have a roof over their head, electricity, running water and 3 squares a day. In return those individuals (who are able) can work 40 hours making the world a better place. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>but don&#39;t act like renting is a good long-term way of life,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i&#39;m not saying that for one second.  what i am saying is that property and renting (in fact all cost of living) are kept artificialy high while they steal the value of our wage with no other reason but to keep us working as long as they can to extract as much energy as they are able.   ie we are slaves on a plantation.   housing should not take 25-30 years to secure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of time you could rent a place, which would be cheaper than getting a mortgage and then paying it off, and then investing the difference in deposits, bonds, shares. With mortgage you&#39;re paying for like 2-3 houses you actually get, whilst with rent you&#39;re not. Presumably your rent would be based on local average, which would factor in the time to pay off the investment in a particular real estate object. This could be anywhere between 5-15 years. But still, for the owner it&#39;s the time enough to cover the cost of <strong>ONE</strong> object (house in this case).</p>

<p>Mortgage is when you pay essentially for 2-3 houses over the course of those 15-25 years you take it on. So the difference between paying rent for 15 years, saving the rest of the money you&#39;d otherwise spend on covering the mortgage, and paying the full mortgage is one full house that you will afford in the end anyway. Difference is, with rent you can move to a different place, can avoid property risks (if it all crashes, you&#39;re good, you&#39;ve got liquid bonds, deposits and shares). Sure, you&#39;re losing out on appreciation of housing over time, but you&#39;re not exposed to the inherent risks. </p>

<p>So if you compare the numbers, it&#39;s more value to not get the mortgage and rent, while investing the difference. So by having more financial knowledge and educating oneself of those other financial tools at your disposal you could escape the debt prison you&#39;re all so worried about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post.  I&#39;m glad you wrote it.  I&#39;m glad I read it.</p>

<p>As a parent I&#39;m already considering how to implement coding into my kids education.  But my wife and I are already instilling empathy and compassion into their lives.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important for the next generation to begin to turn the tide, as you mentioned it comes down to being properly skilled, but more importantly it&#39;s about being able to properly analyze the world around you.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your post</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All true except I would re-phrase that last statement.  There is no intended meaning that I know of for the races.  What could be said, however, is that due to differences among the races, especially IQ, it is therefore difficult for them to live in harmony when in close proximity.  (different goals and ways of achieving goals.  Differences in delayed gratification, and therefore crime and punishment. etc.)  IMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not much of a problem... it&#39;s not like the other countries acquire that money (unless they right out steal the money of their customers.... which wouldn&#39;t be a good business practice).

    <div class="md"><p>Except the cases where it is. When a rent levied against something is more than the real value of that something (including value generated through its use) it causes problems. Basically you get economic singularities that have no real way of being paid off other than defaulting and clearing from the record.</p>
