        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s a fun one, I&#39;m usually a lurker in this sub, but I think there&#39;s something fishy going on here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in Beaver Dam, WI for work and i guess there was an apartment explosion last week. They had to evacuate the whole complex, hundreds displaced. </p>

<p>Local authorities go in and take pictures, and inform the feds of what they found. Feds freaked out, said don&#39;t touch, don&#39;t look at it, you can&#39;t even clean up the body.  Feds make them do a second controlled detonation. All while still not releasing any info. </p>

<p>Now that they had the controlled detonation, they were guna get crews in and fix the Building. Nope, feds say burn it to the ground, people can&#39;t even get their belongings out. So it burns Wednesday  morning.</p>

<p>So they are not giving any Id of the guy making bombs in his apartment, no affiliations. Not releasing the chemicals he had, but they were dangerous enough to not be handled at all. Now they are burning it all to the ground. Now i can give them the benefit of the doubt, small town, explosion. I get it. The kicker is, the judge sealed the search warrants, so we may not ever know. </p>

<p>Sorry if that kind of rambled, I&#39;m in a shitty hotel in beaver dam on my phone. But I though it warranted some interest. Google it, loads of articles and videos pop up</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a large meth lab exploded and immediately became a crisis level bio hazard. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds unlikely. What kind of &quot;bio hazard&quot; would warrant Federal agents step in ordering demolition and burning the whole complex to the ground? Can anyone point to other cases where &quot;meth labs&quot; were handled this way?</p>

<p>What, are they making meth with Sarin or other nerve agents or fucking plutonium these days?</p>

<p>And why would a judge seal the warrants, etc?</p>

<p>It looks like the Feds were aware of some serious fuckery afoot, and they stepped in to make sure that all evidence was destroyed.</p>

<p>Reminds me of how the <strong><em>crime scenes</em></strong> of WTC 1, WTC 2, and Building 7 were &quot;handled&quot; after the 9-11 attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recall a similar incident in Minneapolis, MN being blamed on a gas leak: <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-sues-doj-for-records-regarding-suspicious-2014-new-years-day-explosion-at-apartment-building-in-minneapolis-muslim-neighborhood/">https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-sues-doj-for-records-regarding-suspicious-2014-new-years-day-explosion-at-apartment-building-in-minneapolis-muslim-neighborhood/</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>ATF agents were told not to conduct an investigation of the explosion. In an April 15, 2014, email from a St. Paul ATF group supervisor to a colleague, the supervisor wrote: “Additionally, at the request of the Minneapolis Fire Department, ATF did not respond to this incident.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read somewhere that they believed the explosive material had become embedded in parts of the building, like the attic/insulation. There was also another explosion after the controlled detonation they performed. I&#39;d presume that between those two things, there is no way to guarantee anyone&#39;s safety if they were to enter the building. As far as the burning, my theory is that at least one of the chemicals found was acetone peroxide, which denatures/deactivates when exposed to heat. All speculation, of course...</p>

<p>Officials stress that such disposal will meet all state and federal environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act. Incinerators must achieve a &quot;destruction and removal efficiency&quot; of 99.9999 percent, meaning that no more than 0.0001 percent of the chemical agents can leave the incinerator stack. The National Center for Environmental Health, a federal agency under the US Department of Health and Human Services, says this is &quot;well below levels considered safe for the community.&quot;</p>

Thats an interesting way to put it.

Then the longer they wait the more it would degrade if not kept under optimal conditions. Look at that shit wrong and it goes off.

Obviously the Feebs didn&#39;t want any crime scene evidence which says they already had tabs on the person or persons that did it. They don&#39;t need any more department embarrassments so they told the locals to destroy all the evidence with another explosion which would taint the evidence from the first blast.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, though the videos are fairly irrelevant. You can find the recipe for TATP via a Google search in about 5 seconds, with precise &amp; implicit instructions. It&#39;s made with common items anyone can buy, so unless the feds start barring civilians from purchasing bleach, hydrogen peroxide and drain cleaner, it&#39;s going to be pretty tough to control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmmm very dangerous chemicals can&#39;t even touch the bodies or take them out but will blow off this &quot;controlled&quot; demo an let who knows what off into the air.</p>

<p>Ever since vegas seems like a big deepstate/terrorism coverup going on.</p>

<p>Are they releasing the names of the people inside and how many? Ethnicity? I mean if it&#39;s the fbi and cia just burning all the evidence to the ground there&#39;s most likely something behind it being hidden..it&#39;s a lot harder to solve a crime when you burn the scene down first then investigate..it&#39;s think but I&#39;m no forensics expert.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A key disadvantage is its high susceptibility to accidental detonation (and resulting &quot;workplace accidents&quot; in bomb-making shops), which has led to TATP being referred to as the &quot;Mother of Satan.&quot;[41][38] TATP was found in the accidental explosion that preceded the 2017 terrorist attacks in Barcelona and surrounding areas.[42]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read somewhere that they believed the explosive material had become embedded in parts of the building, like the attic/insulation. There was also another explosion after the controlled detonation they performed. I&#39;d presume that between those two things, there is no way to guarantee anyone&#39;s safety if they were to enter the building. As far as the burning, my theory is that at least one of the chemicals found was acetone peroxide, which denatures/deactivates when exposed to heat. All speculation, of course...</p>
