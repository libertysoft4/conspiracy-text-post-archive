<blockquote>
<p>Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Monday that &quot;there is evidence&quot; showing the Russians attempted to help Trump during the 2016 presidential election, contradicting a draft report from the panel.</p>

<p>“I certainly think there is evidence of that. I don’t know that necessarily there was a full-fledged campaign to do everything that they could to help elect Donald Trump,” Rooney told host Erin Burnett on CNN&#39;s &quot;OutFront.&quot; “I think that their goal was chaos.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand where you are coming from, America has had media portraying Russians as the bad evil communist hater of freedom and raper of liberty since the cold war, so Russian distrust is deeply ingrained forcibly by one sided spin and propaganda in the American mind, any view that contradicts this zeitgeist would be considered &#39;blasphemy&#39; so it would be taken for granted that the whole world feels the same way, this is not the case!

So if it was novichek 5 as some have stated a, how did the UK gov&#39;t decide it was this if it completely untraceable b, it is untraceable so how are Russia implicated, other than the tenuous link of it being a Russian design al those years ago </p>

<p>This may be the reason the Russian foreign secretary Lahov is asking for a sample of the agent used, which Theresa May is refusing to comply with. Because i believe no sample of the novichok agent exists  </p>
