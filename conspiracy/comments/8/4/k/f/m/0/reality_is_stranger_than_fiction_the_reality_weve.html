        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>America is and has been the new vehicle for the nazi fascist party. The history taught to us in school was planned out by the nazi party for the nazi party. They fooled us into believing the war defeated the nazi party and that the good guys had won and all was well. Several nazi leaders escaped to South America where further experiments and plans for world domination were continued .</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/guymartin/2017/06/20/trove-of-nazi-memorabilia-discovered-in-secret-room-in-argentina/amp/">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/guymartin/2017/06/20/trove-of-nazi-memorabilia-discovered-in-secret-room-in-argentina/amp/</a></p>

<p>Also if you haven’t heard of operation paper clip, it is where America scrambled to take as many nazi scientists back to their country to work for them when the war was over. We have had over one thousand nazi scientists at work in our country since the end of WW2. The Denver airport has a painting of a German gas mask trooper with a bayonet and rifle inside (don’t believe me, look it up.) In California there is a navy base built in the shape of a swastika.</p>

<p>If there is one thing to keep your eye on it is how crazy the mass media gets. The crazier the news gets, the more covert manipulative and harmful tactics there will be carried out against American citizens. It is being used as a method of distraction so the corrupt forces in power can engage in methods of covertly destroying us. </p>

<p>Also Autism rates have climbed alarmingly in America. In the 1970’s and 80’s the rate was roughly 1 in 2,000. Now it is 1 in 68 people born and is on pace to be every 1 in 2 people by 2025. This is never talked about in the news and when people express concern, the issue is completely batted to the side. </p>

<p>The people in control have figured out how to psychologically manipulate and disempower us so that we are bottlenecked to a small limited range of behavior and habits. They have made us docile and submissive to an extreme. No one wants to challenge the forces anymore because everyone has been beaten down so much by the system. </p>

<p>We have all the technology and resources to give free energy to the planet and feed every starving person and restore the environment and every animal population. Yet this system is continued because it continues to be run by the same type of people who invented it in the first place and they had only one idea in mind: world domination and control over the human race. Evil on this level never rises to such incredible height when it acts out in the open and for everyone to see. It only makes it this far when it oversaturates the people with distractions  and reasons to fight amongst each other so they never have a moment to catch their own breath and evaluate what is going on right now right here on Earth. This type of evil operates in anonymity and in the shadows. Trying to hide from the people what is really happening. But their secrecy is being revealed to the world now that things are starting to become more obvious.Whether you realize it or not the world is teetering on the brink of catastrophe constantly. </p>

<p>I really have to give it to them though for how ingenious they are. They hide all this evidence in plain sight and then create an entire social system that rewards those who play into it and attempt to be successful. Anyone who speaks against it or questions it is labeled, crazy, a conspiracist, or gets a psychiatric label slapped on their head. </p>

<p>Our true origin and history has also been a massive lie. There has proven to be sophisticated civilizations around 6,000 years before Stonehenge. They never teach us this in school. For me it began with the Sumerians and called them primitive hunter gatherers (despite having perfect depictions of all planets in the solar system in the right size and order). After that it says everything has been a linear progression and that we are currently the apex of humans on Earth. ITS NOT TRUE. If the elites let us know our true nature and how advanced we could be if we restructured society in a healthy way they would risk losing all their control and power. They gain power by creating a new human paradigm that vacuums out all the creative potential and autonomy in young children, from the moment they are able to speak until they are declared an adult, they sit in a class for 6 hours, 5 days a week and are psychologically programmed to be a cog in a gear, a slave to industry (they are trained to sit down in chairs and remain indoors away from nature) movement and being out in the sun and nature do wonders for our brains and bodies and when we are starved of that through our childhood, our potential is greatly dampened. Our true nature is to all be creators and pioneers, each in our own unique way, while connecting to love and truth in the universe. There has been study back into the original development of the Bible, there was no talk about punishment and being doomed to hell. They’ve found that the very first bible basically had one universal rule, all you have to do, no matter how you are born is to strive for universal light and love until you die. Somewhere along the way sociopaths rewrote religion and used it as a system of control and domination over man so that they could get people to fall in line with how they wanted to structure society. If you want to know more about our true ancient history I advise you watch this:</p>

<p>If you haven’t heard of anything I’ve said here this might seem pretty unsettling. The truth is not always comforting but it will set you free. May love, light and truth be with you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In one way of thinking about it, the Nazi&#39;s were the best thing that ever happened to the most powerful Zionists. They got a country out of the deal, which they&#39;re able to run as an ethno-state; they&#39;re now basically accepted in most of the Western world; and they&#39;re able to deflect any criticism of Israeli policy away as anti-Semitism, which they justify because of the Holocaust. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s out of the question that Zionists financed and backed the rise of the Nazis in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking for awhile that during the late 19th-early 20th century that was  growing friction between the the wealthy Zionists and their otherwise normal Jewish counterparts in Europe that were concerned with growing reach of Zionism. In time, the normal Jews would seek to limit the power of the Zionists. Fearing this, the Zionists may have financed means and methods to rid powerful members of their opposition (Nazism, Holocaust etc), and those who remained would not be strong enough or too frightened to challenge them.   </p>
